        "title": "Rusty Russell (American football coach)",
        "text": "Harvey Nual \"Rusty\" Russell (December 4, 1895 – December 21, 1983) was an American football coach at the high school, junior college, and college level in the state of Texas. He served as the head football coach at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 1950 to 1952 and Howard Payne University from 1962 to 1963, compiling career college football coaching record of 17–30–3. Russell was also head football coach at an orphanage in Fort Worth, Texas, the Masonic Home and School, from 1929 to 1941. He co-authored the American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) Code of Ethics in 1952 along with fellow coaches William D. Murray, Lloyd Jordan, and Bud Wilkinson. He is known for developing the spread offense. \nPlaying career.\nRussell attended Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas, where he was a three-sport letterman, in track, basketball, and football, and was captain of both the basketball and football teams. In football he was named all-Texas Intercollegiate Athletic Association (TIAA) at End.\nCoaching career.\nRussell started his coaching career at the high school level. In 1922 he was the head coach at Granger High School for one year (7-3 record). In 1923 he became the assistant head coach at Temple High School, then head coach in 1925 and 1926, where he took them to the state semifinals in 1926 (1925–26; 20–3 record).\nIn 1929 he was hired to start a football program at Fort Worth Masonic Home, where he remained until 1942. While he was there, the team had an overall record of 127–30–12 (81% win percentage). The Masonic Home was an orphanage with a total high school enrollment of about 160 boys and girls. They eventually played in the top class at the time, the \"A\" leagues in Texas, with schools who had thousands of students. In his 16 years at Masonic Home, he went to the State playoffs 10 times. Building a football program from scratch, Russell guided the Masonic Home's 'Mighty Mites' to a tie versus Corsicana High School in the 1932 state championship game. Russell's 1941 team was undefeated but he withdrew from the playoffs following his first postseason win after finding he had an ineligible player who was a year older than the family had listed.\nIn 1942, Russell was hired to coach at Highland Park High School in Dallas. During his first year at Highland Park, Russell remained a coach at Masonic Home, which was 35 miles away. He arranged to coach at the two schools on alternate days and had the games arranged on Fridays and Saturdays so they would not conflict. Masonic Home was a coin toss away from playing Highland Park in the 1942 playoffs. Russell remained at Highland Park until 1944; he had an overall record there of 27–4. He guided a squad that featured Bobby Layne and Doak Walker to an appearance in the 1944 state championship game.\nIn 1944, he was hired as backfield coach at Southern Methodist University. He lured away Doak Walker from the University of Texas to enroll at SMU instead. As head assistant coach and responsible for the offense, Russell enjoyed a 32 win 16 loss and 5 tie record, where the Mustangs were nationally ranked, won two Southwest Conference championships, and made two Cotton Bowl appearances in 1947 and 1948. Following Matty Bell's resignation on January 22, 1950, Russell was immediately named his successor. After a good start with a 6–4 season in 1950 where SMU was rated #1 in the nation midway through the season, Russell was increasingly under fire after two losing seasons in 1951 and 1952. He eventually resigned on February 2, 1953. Russell then coached one year at Schreiner College, 1953 (5–3–1). He then went on to Victoria College as head coach and athletic director from 1954 through the 1960 seasons, where his record was (40–27–2). He then retired from coaching.\nIn 1962, he came out of retirement to be the head coach at his alma mater, Howard Payne University. He again retired after two losing seasons. His record as a high school head coach over 23 seasons, was 181 wins, 40 losses, and 14 ties (82% win %), His overall record as a head coach in 23 years as high school and 13 years as college head coach is 250-100-21 (71% win percentage). He was an assistant coach for 5 years in College at SMU and 2 years in high school at Temple, Texas, for a total career of 42 years. He held a master's degree in education and was a teacher and principal many of his high school coaching years. Russell coached a number of All-Americans while at SMU, among them Doak Walker, Dick McKissack, Kyle Rote, Dick Hightower and Val Joe Walker. Doak Walker also asked Russell to make his introduction as he received the 1948 Heisman trophy award. In addition, Walker won the Maxwell Award in 1947. Russell also had two All-Americans at Victoria (Charlie Burk and Floyd Dellinger). Russell coached a number of NFL players, among them: Kyle Rote, Doak Walker, Bobby Layne, Tex Coulter, Hardy Brown, Herschel Forester, Bill Forester, Paul Page, Raymond Berry, Fred Benners, Pat Knight, Ed Bernet and Forrest Gregg.\nUsing a complex passing attack, unheard of at the time, Russell is considered one of the forerunners of the spread offense.\nHonors.\nRussell was inducted to the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame in 1990. He is member of the Sports Hall of Fame at Howard Payne University, the Texas High School Coaches Hall of Honor, and the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. He won NCAA National Coach of the week when at SMU, once in 1950 and again in 1951 for his respective wins over Ohio State and Notre Dame. Russell was also a charter member of the National Football Hall of Fame Association.\nDeath.\nRussell died in a hospital in Plano, Texas on December 21, 1983, at the age of 88.\nIn popular culture.\nThe story of the Mighty Mites and their rise from a team of rag-tag orphans to a Texas football powerhouse was the subject of the 2008 book \"Twelve Mighty Orphans: The Inspiring True Story of the Mighty Mites Who Ruled Texas Football\" by sportswriter Jim Dent. Jim Dent refers to Russell in the book as \"the father of the spread offense\". That book was adapted as the 2021 film \"12 Mighty Orphans\", in which Russell was portrayed by Luke Wilson."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected no one. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on August 6, 1990; after being delayed a day due to rain, it was held indoors due to continued bad weather.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1970 or later, but not after 1984; the ballot included candidates from the 1989 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1984. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 1990 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 9. The ballot consisted of 44 players; a total of 444 ballots were cast, with 333 votes required for election. A total of 3,050 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.87 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The two candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in italics. The 20 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nRoy Face was on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 19 All-Stars, four of whom were not on the ballot, who were selected a total of 50 times. The field included 10-time All-Star Joe Morgan, 6-time All-Star Jim Palmer, and 5-time All-Star Amos Otis. The group of new candidates include one MVP (Morgan, who won twice), one Cy Young Award winner (Palmer, who won thrice), and one Rookie of the Year (Lou Piniella).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" on the ballot were: Glenn Abbott, Jerry Augustine, Tom Burgmeier, John Curtis, Jim Essian, Pete Falcone, Ron Hodges, Ron Jackson, Frank LaCorte, Jerry Martin, Milt May, Larry Milbourne, Sid Monge, Biff Pocoroba, Ron Reed, Leon Roberts, Craig Swan, Tom Underwood, Mike Vail, and Tom Veryzer.\nJ.

He was in Buffalo's front office for all of its record four straight trips to the NFL championship game from 1991 to 1994. The Bills lost all of those Super Bowls. During his tenure there, the Bills went to the playoffs 10 times and had a record of 140–83.\nAs Buffalo's personnel director, he was known for finding big talent at small colleges, such as wide receiver Don Beebe of Chadron State and defensive end Phil Hansen of North Dakota. He drafted Marcellus Wiley out of Columbia, then signed him as a free agent after he had taken over the Chargers in January 2001.\nButler built the foundation for San Diego's offense by drafting running back LaDainian Tomlinson and quarterback Drew Brees. San Diego went 5–11 and 8–8 in Butler's two seasons, improving from 1–15 the year before Butler's arrival.\nButler died of lymphoma on April 11, 2003. He was 56."

        "text": "Jeffrey Alan Zimmerman (January 10, 1965 - March 1, 2024) is an American former college and professional football player who was an offensive lineman in the National Football League (NFL) for four seasons during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He played college football for the University of Florida, and was twice recognized as an All-American. The Dallas Cowboys selected him in the third round of the 1987 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nZimmerman was born in Enid, Oklahoma in 1963. He attended Maynard Evans High School in Orlando, Florida, where he played as an offensive tackle and was named high school All-American in 1982.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted a football scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played for coach Charley Pell and coach Galen Hall's Florida Gators football teams from 1983 to 1986.\nAs a freshman, he was a backup at guard behind John Hunt. The next year, he became the starter a right guard.\nIn 1985, although he lost two weeks due to a right knee injury he suffered against Rutgers University, he became the first Gators lineman to be named to an All-American team as an underclassman.\nHe was nicknamed \"One Man Gang\" by his teammates and was a two-year starter at right guard, until his senior season when he was moved to right tackle. He excelled at pass protection, despite suffering a pulled groin in mid-season.\nZimmerman was one of the members of the Gators' outstanding offensive line of the mid-1980s known as the \"Great Wall of Florida,\" which included Phil Bromley, Lomas Brown, Billy Hinson and Crawford Ker. Behind their blocking, the Gators' quarterback Kerwin Bell, fullback John L. Williams and halfback Neal Anderson led the Gators to identical 9–1–1 overall win–loss records and best-in-the-SEC records of 5–0–1 and 5–1 in 1984 and 1985, respectively. \nProfessional career.\nHe was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the third round (68th overall) of the 1987 NFL Draft. He was part of a change in the offensive line philosophy, when the team started to value size and strength over speed and athletic ability. Although he was initially projected as a first-round draft choice, the weight problems he displayed as a senior and in the post-season dropped his value.\nAs a rookie, he was a backup at left guard behind Nate Newton. His only recognition came from knocking All-Pro Lawrence Taylor unconscious during a blitz, in a game against the New York Giants September 20. On October 1, he made his first career start against the Philadelphia Eagles at left guard.\nIn 1988, a dislocated shoulder he suffered in training camp limited his playing time to one game. He was placed on the injured reserve list on September 23, after re-injuring in the third week of the season. \nIn 1989, he was able to play in his only full season, becoming a key backup at guard and tackle, on an offensive line that limited opponents to a then franchise record low 30 sacks. On December 16, he lined up at right tackle to make his second NFL start. He also was used as the third tight end in short yardage situations.\nIn 1990, he started the first 9 weeks of the year on the injured reserve list with a sprained knee injury he suffered in training camp. He was reactivated on November 7. After sitting out the San Francisco game, he saw action in the final six contests of the season as a backup guard. He also was used as the third tight end in short yardage situations.\nDuring the 1991 off-season without any previous notice, he chose not to attend the Cowboys' conditioning program nor training camp, and was placed on the reserve/did not report list. He announced his retirement from pro football at a later time, after the problems he experienced controlling his weight hampered his performance and cut his career short."

        "text": "The 1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 58th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 14, 1987, at the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California, the home of the Oakland Athletics of the American League. The game resulted in the National League defeating the American League 2-0 in 13 innings. Montreal Expos outfielder Tim Raines was named the Most Valuable Player.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nGame summary.\nWhile the previous three All-Star games had had good pitching, the 1987 Midsummer Classic had great pitching. Never before was an All-Star game scoreless after five innings; however, the 1987 game did not see a run until the 13th inning.\nAfter 12 scoreless innings, National League catcher Ozzie Virgil Jr. began the 13th with a single off American League pitcher Jay Howell. Howell would get pitcher Lee Smith to strike out trying to bunt, however, shortstop Hubie Brooks followed with a single, moving Virgil up to second base. Outfielder Willie McGee lined out for the second out of the inning, bringing up outfielder Tim Raines. Raines delivered in the clutch, with a two-run triple, giving the National League a 2-0 lead. Second baseman Juan Samuel lined out, ending the inning. In the bottom of the 13th, Sid Fernandez walked leadoff man Kevin Seitzer, but retired the next three batters in order to give the National League the victory. Due to the length of the game, Lee Smith, a Cubs pitcher at the time, needed to bat. He did not bring his Cubs helmet so he used a Montreal Expos helmet likely from either Tim Wallach or Hubie Brooks."

        "text": "The 1973 Rose Bowl was the 59th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 1. It matched the undefeated and top-ranked USC Trojans of the Pacific-8 Conference with the #3 Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference.\nUSC running back Sam Cunningham scored four touchdowns in the second half and was named the Player of the Game, as the favored Trojans won They were unanimous national champions in both major polls, the first time in college football history. (The final UPI Coaches Poll was released prior to the bowl games, in early December.)\nThe attendance of 106,869 set the stadium record, as well as the NCAA bowl game record.\nTeams.\nThe national championship was on the line for #1 USC, and likely #3 Ohio State. Although #2 Oklahoma already had defeated Penn State in the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Eve to finish their season a convincing win in the Rose Bowl for the Buckeyes might well have swayed the voters to put Ohio State at #1.\nUSC.\nThe USC Trojans won all eleven games in the 1972 regular season. Their opener against #4 Arkansas propelled them to the top of the polls, where they remained throughout the season. They had help from new head coach Pepper Rodgers' UCLA Bruins, who had defeated #1 Nebraska to start the season, led by junior college transfer quarterback Mark Harmon. The Trojans' closest contest was a defeat of #15 Stanford. In the UCLA–USC rivalry game with the Rose Bowl on the line for both teams, the Bruins were outmatched by the Trojans USC then soundly defeated Notre Dame behind the six touchdowns of Anthony Davis. Quarterbacking duties were shared by Mike Rae and Pat Haden. The Trojans were favored by two touchdowns in this the first of three consecutive appearances, all against Ohio State.\nOhio State.\nThis was the first year that freshmen were eligible for varsity football in the University Division (now FBS) due to the NCAA rescinding an earlier rule, and it was the first of four Rose Bowl appearances for freshman Archie Griffin. Ohio State had one loss at Michigan State, on November 11. USC had demolished the Spartans only five weeks earlier in a night game at the Coliseum. Against rival Michigan, the Rose Bowl was on the line for both teams; the Big Ten had rescinded its long-standing \"no repeat\" rule, so Michigan was eligible to play in the Rose Bowl for a second straight year, and the unbeaten Wolverines were a slight favorite over the Buckeyes in Columbus. However, Ohio State used a defensive goal line stand in the first half and another in the second half to beat #3 Michigan The Buckeyes and Wolverines shared the Big Ten title, and the conference's athletic directors voted to give Ohio State the Rose Bowl bid. Because the Big Ten and Pac-8 did not yet permit teams to play in any postseason game except the Rose Bowl, the Wolverines stayed at home. The two conferences allowed multiple bowl teams starting with the 1975 season.\nGame summary.\nAt the half, the score was tied at seven. USC running back Sam Cunningham exploded for four touchdowns in the second half and Anthony Davis added another as the Trojans coasted to a 32-point lead. Ohio State scored a touchdown in the last minute and the final score was It was the fourth consecutive win for the Pac-8, but that streak ended in the next year's rematch.\nAftermath.\nRose Bowl records.\nCunningham set three modern Rose Bowl records with four touchdowns in his final college football game. As of 2008, the records for touchdowns, rushing touchdowns and points scored have been matched by Eric Ball (1986), Ron Dayne (1999), and Vince Young (2006).\nA Rose Bowl record for most points in a half at 45 was set in the second half (USC 35, Ohio State 10). This was later tied in 1999 (Wisconsin 24, UCLA 21) and surpassed by USC and Texas with 53 points in the second half in 2006.\nThe record attendance of this year was later approached, but never be matched again in the Rose Bowl. In 1998, the Rose Bowl stadium was renovated and had its seating capacity reduced, and was no longer the largest football stadium in the United States. As of the 2008 Rose Bowl game, the Rose Bowl game still draws the largest crowds of any post-season college football contest.\nOhio State–USC.\nThis was the first of three Ohio State-USC matchups in the Rose Bowl in the 1970s. It was the first of four consecutive Rose Bowl appearances for the Buckeyes under head coach Woody Hayes and two-time Heisman trophy winner Archie Griffin. Prior to the game contest, Hayes pushed a camera into the face of a local news screaming, \"That'll take care of you, you son of a bitch.\" Hayes was ejected and left California with a subpoena. won the rematch the following year, the sole Rose Bowl victory for the Big Ten in the 1970s.\nNFL players.\nThe 1972 Trojans had 33 players selected in the next several NFL Drafts, including five first-round selections: Charle Young, Sam Cunningham, Pete Adams, Lynn Swann, and Steve Riley. The 1972 Trojan team was named one of the best teams of the Twentieth century. The Buckeyes had eight eventual NFL first round selections: Tim Fox, Archie Griffin, Kurt Schumacher, Doug France, Neal Colzie, John Hicks, Rick Middleton, and Randy Gradishar\nLegacy.\nSports announcer Keith Jackson identified the 1972 USC Trojans as the greatest team he ever saw. Sportswriter Beano Cook placed them at third of his all time teams on the basis of that assertion. \"The Sporting News\" ranked the 1972 Trojans in their top 25 greatest teams.\nQuotes.\n\"I never saw any team that could beat them,\" USC head coach John McKay said.\nWashington State head coach Jim Sweeney disagreed. \"USC's not the No. 1 team in the country,\" said Sweeney, whose Cougars endured a to the Trojans. \"The [1972] Miami Dolphins are better.\""

Named after the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF) annual pay-per-view event WrestleMania, it was the first WWF licensed game available for these computers which were still dominant in Europe. It was followed on most of these computers by 1992's \"WWF European Rampage Tour\".\nIn February 1993, the Spectrum and Amstrad CPC versions were released as part of the \"Super Fighter\" compilation with \"Pit-Fighter\" and \"Final Fight\".\nVisually, the game resembles the arcade game \"WWF Superstars\", and it plays somewhat similarly as well.\nGameplay.\nThe player can choose from either Hulk Hogan, The Ultimate Warrior, or The British Bulldog and must defeat five opponents to become the WWF World Heavyweight Champion. The opponents are, in order, Mr. Perfect, The Warlord, \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase, The Mountie, and Sgt. Slaughter. Before each match, the opponent will taunt the player's wrestler with a comment, and the player will then be able to choose from several replies in a nod to the WWF house style at the time.\nEach wrestler is able to perform basic punches and kicks as well as a range of more advanced moves such as dropkicking, clotheslining, and one signature grapple maneuver which is performed by \"waggling the joystick\". In addition, there is a chair outside the ring which can be used as a weapon. Matches have a five-minute time limit, and a time limit draw or count-out will have the same effect as losing a match. The player has a total of four credits.\nThe game also features a practice mode in which the player faces a prone opponent. Another player can also control the second wrestler, but it will always be Mr. Perfect.\nReception.\nThe game was well received. \"Crash\" said that Ocean captured the atmosphere of the sport perfectly. \"Sinclair User\" liked the game, but criticized the lack of alternate difficulty options. \"Your Sinclair\" said that \"the graphics in WWF are really slick\", and also praised the multiplayer option, which they described as \"the best two-player game that's been seen on any Speccy fighting game\"."

        "text": "Michael William Grady (December 23, 1869 – December 3, 1943), was a professional baseball player who played catcher in the Major Leagues from 1894 to 1906. Grady played for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Giants, Washington Senators, and St. Louis Cardinals.\nGrady was one of the first players from Chester County, Pennsylvania, to play Major League Baseball. Before signing with the Phillies, he played in the Brandywine AA League of West Chester.\nGrady made his major league debut on April 24, 1894 as a member of the Phillies. Grady hit .363 over the course of his rookie season, during which the pitching mound was moved back to its current distance of 60 feet, 6 inches from the plate and three Phillies outfielders batted over .400.\nGrady is largely famous for an apocryphal story about his committing four fielding errors on a single play, a story he would repeatedly tell long after his playing days were over; however, there is no contemporaneous record of this. \nGrady compiled a .294 career average over his 11 major league seasons. He led the league in OPS (a commonly used stat today that adds on-base percentage with slugging percentage) for a catcher in 1904 and 1905, and finished third in that category in his final season in 1906.\nAll told, Grady finished his career with 884 hits, 35 home runs and 461 RBIs. After a shaky rookie season during which he posted a .900 fielding percentage, he improved his defense considerably, rounding out his career with a .950 mark in that category.\nHe later was a player/manager in 1907 and 1908 in the Tri-State League."

        "text": "The Oberhof bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track is a venue used for bobsled, luge and skeleton located in Oberhof, Germany.\nHistory.\nOberhof had been the home of sledding activities since 1905, mostly bobsleigh. In 1931, the facility hosted the first ever FIBT World Championships in the two-man bobsleigh event won by the two-man German team of Hanns Killian and Sebastian Huber. After World War II, Oberhof was partitioned into East Germany. Following the successes of the East Germans at the FIL World Luge Championships during the 1960s with Thomas Köhler (men's singles world champion in 1962 and 1967, men's doubles world champion in 1965 and 1967), Ilse Geisler (women's singles world champion in 1962 and 1963), Ortrun Enderlein (women's singles world champion in 1965 and 1967), Petra Tierlich (women's singles world champion in 1969, Wolfgang Scheidel (men's doubles world champion in 1965), and Klaus Bonsack (men's doubles world champion in 1967), the East German government decided it was time to construct a permanent, artificially refrigerated reinforced concrete track for year-round training and usage. In 1966, East Germany was awarded the FIL World Luge Championships in Friedrichroda (misspelled as Friedrichsroda), but the event was cancelled. The success of the first permanent bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in Königssee, West Germany, completed in 1968 and first used for the world luge championships the following year, also played a factor. In 1969, it was decided to construct a permanent facility in Oberhof. The track was completed in 1971 with a World Cup test taking place the following year. Since then the track has hosted World Cup events, mostly in luge though it has hosted events in bobsleigh (1974 in two-man) and skeleton (1993). \nRenovations.\nOberhof has undergone four track renovations, the first in 1996 where it was closed from April to October for a total reconstruction, a second in 2002 when a new ammonia refrigeration system was installed and turn 14 was modified for safety reason, and a third in 2006 when new start houses were built for both men and women, and turn 7's profile was modified for safety reasons. The cost of the 2016 renovation was €4 million. The track was again renovated in 2020 with improvements to the roof as well as redesign of many of the track curves and improvements to the starts and start houses. \nStatistics.\nOverall track length is 1354.5 meters. The venue includes a vertical drop of 96.37 meters from start to finish.\nThe only named curves are the \"S-Kombination\" (German for \"S Combination\") which are turns eight through eleven and the \"Zielkurve\" (German for \"Finish Curve\") is turn fourteen, a Kreisel (or circular) curve."

        "text": "The Australian state of Tasmania has one of the longest traditions of cricket-playing in the southern hemisphere. Cricket is recorded as having first been played in Tasmania very shortly after the arrival of British settlers on the island on 12 September 1803, however it wasn't until nearly fifty years later that First-class cricket was to be played there.\nDespite the long wait since the foundation of the colony, Tasmania played in the first ever first-class cricket match in Australia, which was played on 11 February and 12 February 1851, against Victoria, with Tasmania emerging victorious by 3 wickets. For that first match, Tasmania was captained by John Marshall.\nFollowing that first ever First-class match Tasmania endured a long period of isolation, in which the island's cricketers had to content themselves with occasional First-class matches against other colonies, primarily Victoria, and touring or representative sides.\nAustralia's elite First-class cricket competition, the Sheffield Shield was established in 1892, however Tasmania was not invited to participate in that elite competition until 1977, and even then, their first four seasons were on a limited fixture list.\nThese are lists of the men who have been the official Tasmanian captains in First-class, List A and Twenty20 domestic matches. \nWhere a player has a dagger (†) after his period of captaincy, that denotes that player deputised for the appointed captain. The dagger classification follows that adopted by \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\".\nFirst-class captains.\nThis is a list of cricketers who have captained the Tasmanian cricket team for at least one First-class match. It is complete up to the 2018/19 season.\nNotes:\nList A captains.\nDespite not participating in the Sheffield Shield at that time, Tasmania was included in the inaugural List A cricket competition in Australia that began in 1969/70, and has participated in every subsequent season.\nThis is a complete list of every man who has captained the Tasmanian Tigers in List A cricket.\nNotes:\nAll statistics correct as of 19 October 2016.\nTwenty20 captains.\nTasmania played their first Twenty20 cricket match against the Queensland Bulls on 6 January 2006; however, the match ended with no result. Below is the record of all the men who have captained Tasmania in Twenty20 cricket matches.\nNotes:\nAll statistics correct as of 1 February 2011."

The strongest pre-final favourite and the fresh world record holder at this distance, David Moorcroft, took the lead shortly after the start. Before the 600-metre mark, his teammate\nMike McLeod went into the lead, perhaps to spare Moorcroft from leading too long. McLeod passed 1,000 metres in a sluggish time of 2:46.91. Before the 1,200-metre mark, Finland's tall Martti Vainio accelerated into the lead. He was passed after 1,900 metres by Moorcroft, who led the 15-man field through 2,000 metres in 5:28.89. For some reason, however, Moorcroft slowed the pace down, with 3,000 metres being passed in a slow time of 8:16.55. As the tightly bunched group of runners was approaching 3,200 metres, East Germany's Hansjörg Kunze, one of the pre-race favourites, was pushed, lost his rhythm for a moment, and accidentally ran a few steps on the field. McLeod went into the lead again, somewhat increasing the pace. At 3,400 metres, Vainio accelerated into the lead, and sprinted the following 200 metres in under 31 seconds. However, his legs were tired of the 10,000-metre final and his rather fast 5,000-metre heat, and he was forced to slow down. Around 3,800 metres, there was another shoving match, involving Italy's Alberto Cova and Austria's Dietmar Millonig. Cova pushed Millonig so strongly, after having been pushed or elbowed by a third runner, that he was disqualified after the final. At 4,000 metres, Vainio still led the field in 10:57.19. Around this time, Sweden's Mats Erixon began gradually to lose contact with the main group. Before the 4,200-metre mark, Moorcroft went into the lead again, intending to gradually increase the pace before the final lap. After 4,400 metres, West Germany's Christoph Herle dropped from the lead group. Before 4,500 metres, the Soviet Union's Dmitriy Dmitriyev passed Moorcroft, who was soon surrounded by several other runners. Also Switzerland's Markus Ryffel dropped from the lead group before 4,600 metres, while Cova, McLeod and Kunze began to struggle. At 4,600 metres, Dmitriyev still led the main group in 12:34.25. Soon after that, East Germany's Werner Schildhauer passed him. Before 4,750 metres, West Germany's Thomas Wessinghage sprinted past Schildhauer, and already opened a five-metre gap by 4,800 metres. Moorcroft accelerated into the second place, followed by his other teammate Tim Hutchings. By the start of the home straight, Wessinghage's lead was at least eight or nine metres. With over 20 metres left, Schildhauer passed Moorcroft, to claim the silver medal. Hutchings faded into seventh place, while Bulgaria's Evgeni Ignatov rose to fourth place with a strong final kick.

They are frequently associated with gambling, with money, usually small stakes, changing hands depending on which funnies occur.\nTypes of Funny.\nThe most common funnies and their usual meanings are:\nThese are all positive outcomes, resulting in a gain, either financial or simply in pride, for the successful player.\nA negative funny is:\nLess common funnies:\nPositive:\nNegative:\nSimilar events.\nOther occurrences that are used for gambling:\nPositive: \nLongest Drive and Nearest the Pin are most usually competed for by all of those taking part on Golf Society or corporate days with prizes for the winners.\nNegative: \n\"Carry the Can\" Funnies:\nRather like Atlas, who incorrectly was said to have been left supporting the world on his shoulders when someone passed it to him, there is a category of Funny which passes from one player to another rather than simply being won or lost as you go along. Each time it is passed, the fund is increased by one as in a skins game and the player left holding the funny at the end of the round pays out the amount it has accumulated to each of the other players.\nMost common:\nLess common:"

        "text": "Seán Kevin O'Brien (born 14 February 1987) is an Irish retired professional rugby union player. He previously represented home province Leinster for eleven seasons. At Leinster, he helped the team win four European titles, and was named ERC European Player of the Year for the 2010–11 season, he then played three season's for English Premiership Rugby side London Irish.\nInternationally, he played for Ireland for ten years, and toured twice with the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2013 and 2017. O'Brien could play across the back-row, though he primarily played as an openside flanker. He announced his retirement from rugby in 2022.\nProfessional career.\nLeinster.\nO’Brien made his Leinster debut against Cardiff Blues in September 2008 in the Celtic League. He made his Heineken Cup debut against Castres Olympique in December 2008. He did not feature for Leinster in the 2009 Heineken Cup Final, but evidence of O’Brien's emergence as one of the most exciting young back-row forwards in Europe came in the form of strong interest from France before Christmas of 2010. The Irish Rugby Football Union moved quickly and O’Brien agreed a new three-year deal with Leinster the following January.\nO'Brien was in outstanding form for Leinster during the pool stages of the 2010–11 Heineken Cup, and was an integral part of the team that beat Northampton Saints to win the 2011 Heineken Cup Final. In 2012 O'Brien helped Leinster win the 2012 Heineken Cup Final, scoring a try as Leinster beat Ulster. In January 2014, O'Brien signed a new two-year deal with Leinster. On 21 December 2015, O'Brien signed a new three-year contract with Leinster.\nLondon Irish.\nO'Brien joined English Premiership side London Irish, where former Ireland head coach Declan Kidney and assistant coach Les Kiss are director of rugby and head coach respectively, in December 2019, after the completion of the 2019 Rugby World Cup. O'Brien made his debut against Sale Sharks on 6 March 2020. He retired from rugby at the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.\nIreland and British &amp; Irish Lions.\nIn 2007, he was a member of the Ireland Under-20 Grand Slam winning squad. O'Brien was called up to the Ireland team for the 2009 November Tests, and he gained his first cap when he came on as a substitute against Fiji at the RDS Arena on 21 November 2009. He also came on as a replacement against South Africa in a 15–10 win on 28 November 2009. He came off the bench against Italy in the 2010 Six Nations Championship, but was dropped afterwards. He was injured during Ireland's 2010 Summer Tests, but won his first start against Samoa in the 2010 Autumn Tests, though he did not feature in any other games. O'Brien started every game for Ireland during the 2011 Six Nations, winning the Man of the Match award against Italy. \nHe came third in the 2011 Six Nations Player of the Championship losing out to the winner Andrea Masi. He was selected in Ireland's final 30-man squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. O'Brien started against Australia, Russia, Italy and Wales during Ireland's World Cup campaign, scoring a try against Russia and winning the Man-of-the-Match award against Italy. O’Brien was ranked among the five best players at the 2011 World Cup, due in significant part to his standout performance against Australia where he led the team in both tackles and runs.\nO’Brien did not play for Ireland during 2014 due lingering problems from a shoulder injury. In the final 2015 Rugby World Cup Pool D match, O'Brien punched Pascal Papé in the first minute of the win over France. The incident went unnoticed by the match officials, and O'Brien later was named man of the match. The win earned Ireland top pool placement, and a quarter-final against Argentina. O'Brien was later cited by World Rugby, and received a one-game ban (reduced from the recommended minimum of two for mitigating factors including an \"exemplary disciplinary record\"), meaning he was unable to play in the quarter-final. \nO’Brien last played for Ireland in the 2019 Six Nations. He missed the 2019 Rugby World Cup due to a hip injury. After joining London Irish in 2020 O'Brien said that he would love to play for Ireland again but he is aware of the unwritten rule in Irish rugby regarding players based overseas not being selected for the national team and he doesn't see this being any different for himself.\nAwards.\nO'Brien was named 2010–2011 ERC European Player of the Year following a season where Leinster were Heineken Cup champions.\nHe was one of five players shortlisted from the 24 Heineken Cup and 20 Amlin Challenge Cup teams that included Leinster teammates Jamie Heaslip and Isa Nacewa.\nO’Brien was ranked by the IRB among the five best players at the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nO'Brien was awarded the 2011 Guinness/Rugby Writers of Ireland player of the year and received his award at a function in the Aviva Stadium, Dublin.\nPersonal life.\nIn September 2014, he bought Bellamy's Pub in Ballsbridge with Leinster teammates Rob Kearney, Dave Kearney and Jamie Heaslip. After an extensive refurbishment, it was reopened as \"The Bridge 1859\". They have all since opened Blackrock Bar And plan to open a smaller lemon duke restaurant called ‘Little Duke”.\nSince 2018, O'Brien had been in a relationship with Sarah Rowe. They Broke up in December 2020."

        "title": "1943 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1943 Rose Bowl game was the 29th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Friday, January 1. The second-ranked Georgia Bulldogs of the Southeastern Conference (SEC) defeated the #13 UCLA Bruins of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), 9–0.\nThe game returned to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena after being played in North Carolina at Duke Stadium in Durham the year before. Charley Trippi of Georgia was named the Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nAfter the 1942 Allied victory in the Battle of Midway and the end of the Japanese offensives in the Pacific Theater during 1942, it was deemed that the West Coast was no longer vulnerable to attack, and the Rose Bowl game returned to southern California. On October 10, 1942, the decision was announced that the game would be played, pending approval of the Army, however, the parade still would not be held. By November 5, 1942, it was announced that the East-West Game could occur in San Francisco. On November 18, the Rose Bowl was permitted by the Western Defense Command.\nFew Georgia fans were able to make the trip because of travel restrictions, and there were many military servicemen in attendance. The Tournament of Roses parade itself still was not held due to the war. Due to the number of American servicemen stationed in Australia, the game was broadcast live on Australian radio.\nTeams.\nUCLA Bruins.\nUCLA won the Pacific Coast Conference title for the first time in school history. The Bruins also won their first victory in the UCLA–USC rivalry. This Rose Bowl game was the first appearance for the Bruins in the post season since their Poi Bowl (later the Pineapple Bowl) victory in 1939.\nThe previous season saw UCLA and USC tie 7–7 in a matchup of lower-tier teams. They had played that year (unwittingly) on the eve of America's entry into World War II, on December 6, 1941.\nIn 1942, the Bruins and Trojans met with the Rose Bowl on the line for both teams. On December 12, 1942, UCLA defeated USC for the first time 14–7.\nGeorgia Bulldogs.\nThe Tournament of Roses committee were responsible for selecting and inviting the opposing team. For their final games in the 1942 season, the second-ranked Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (at 9–0) traveled to Athens to face the fifth-ranked Bulldogs (at 9–1) for their rivalry game. The Bulldogs defeated the Engineers 34–0, and were awarded the Rose Bowl Bid on November 28, 1942. Georgia finished the number two team in the nation behind number one Ohio State. The Western Conference, forerunner of the Big Ten Conference, did not permit their teams to play in bowl games until the 1946 agreement between the Big Nine and the PCC. The Bulldogs featured 1942 Heisman Trophy winner Frank Sinkwich, Maxwell Award winner Charley Trippi, and Jim Todd (Laurens, SC) backing up Trippi. The Bulldogs had been named national champions by the Berryman, DeVold, Houlgate, Litkenhous, Poling, and Williamson polls. Georgia had played their first bowl game the previous year, the 1942 Orange Bowl.\nScoring summary.\nThe Temperature was and sunny in Pasadena. UCLA wore gold helmets, white jerseys, and gold pants. Georgia had silver helmets, red jerseys, and gray pants.\nThe game was scoreless until the fourth quarter. The Bulldogs had 25 first downs to the Bruins' 5. In the fourth quarter, the Bruins were backed up against the south goal line. Bob Waterfield attempted the punt 10 yards back from the line of scrimmage as was the custom at the time. The punt was blocked out of the end zone.\nAftermath.\nThe UCLA Bruins had 5 first downs to Georgia's 25 and were regarded as no match for the Bulldogs. The Bruins were considered lucky to have held Georgia to 9 points. Georgia coach Wally Butts was reportedly sweating over the Bruins' defense during the game. A spectator in the stadium died of a heart attack during the game. The Georgia team remained in town a day to celebrate after the game. The team got a studio tour and met with Hollywood stars.\nThe UCLA team also received star attention. UCLA fans Mickey Rooney and Ava Gardner rented the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom at the Ambassador Hotel for a party for the Bruins football team.\nCharley Trippi of Georgia was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. Lynn \"Buck\" Compton, who played for UCLA, and started at guard in the game, later earned a Silver Star for his meritorious action at Brécourt Manor. The action was later dramatized in episode two of the HBO miniseries \"Band of Brothers\". According to Lynn \"Buck\" Compton(See \"Call of Duty\" by Lt. Lynn Buck Compton, Life, before, during, and after the \"Band of Brothers), shortly after the game, the entire Senior Class of those players, who were also in ROTC, were taken into the military, prior to graduation and sent to Officer Candidate School. Buck went on to Ft. Benning Georgia.\nBecause of the agreement made in 1946 by what are now the Big Ten and the Pac-12 Conferences (and their respective predecessors), this was Georgia's lone appearance in the Rose Bowl game until the agreements that starting in the 1998 season, the Rose Bowl would be part of any national championship format. That agreement meant Georgia would not appear until the 2018 game, when they were the third seed in the College Football Playoff in the year the game was a semifinal game. For the 2008 Rose Bowl, a hopeful matchup was examined that Georgia might play USC, but the Sugar Bowl would not give up the Bulldogs.\nDuring World War II, UCLA left end Milt \"Snuffy\" Smith was critically injured when his crew was struck by a missile. When he was about to be declared a hopeless case and to be abandoned, a medic saw his \"Rose Bowl, 1943\" engraved wrist watch he was wearing and shouted, \"This is one guy we’ve got to save.\" Smith recovered after 18 months of hospitalization.\nGeorgia would not return to the Rose Bowl game until January 1, 2018—an absence of 75 years.\nExternal links.\nUniversity of Georgia Library Film Archives"

        "text": "Wimbledon Rugby Football Club is a sports club based in Wimbledon, London. The club was a founding member of the Rugby Football Union and were at that time known as the Wimbledon Hornets. The first rugby union team currently play in National League 2 East following their promotion from Regional 1 South Central at the end of 2022–23 season.\nApart from rugby, the club has a netball section.\nHistory.\nWimbledon’s first recorded match was against Richmond F.C. in November 1865, making the club one of the oldest in the country, and one of just twelve surviving clubs that founded the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The club’s captain at this time was L J Maton who drafted the first laws of the game and went on to become the third president of the RFU in 1875. In the same year, two club members, J D and H J Graham, gained one and four caps respectively for England.\nIn 1874 the club changed its name to Wimbledon RFC. It has been suggested that the change in name was due to the club's L J Maton becoming president of the Rugby Football Union, and in order to reflect their new-found gravitas they dispensed with the Hornets for a less whimsical name.\nThey played on Wimbledon Common until World War I, using the Rose &amp; Crown in Wimbledon Village as changing rooms and clubhouse. The club then went into suspended animation when the First World War started, and was only re-formed in 1927. It was at this time that the club changed colours from broad blue and white hooped jerseys, to maroon and Cambridge blue hooped jerseys. The club's celebration of its centenary with a dinner held in February 1966, was demonstrative that it perceived itself a continuation of the original Wimbledon Hornets. They moved to the current clubhouse on Barham Road, Wimbledon in the 1987–88 season, coinciding with the setting up of amateur league rugby in Britain.\nHonours.\n1st team:\n2nd team:\nClub colours.\nWimbledon 1st team play in maroon shirts with blue sleeves and a blue stripe on the side. They wear navy shorts and navy socks.\nAll other teams play in maroon and blue hooped shirts with navy shorts and navy socks.\nTeams.\nWimbledon has four men's teams, a ladies team and a thriving youth &amp; mini section.\nThe men's teams\nWimbledon currently has four men's teams.\nThe 1st team play in London &amp; South East Premier (Nat3SE), as a result of result of relegation from National League 2S in the 2017–18 season. The 2nd team play in the Zoo Sports Shield Division 1 having won consecutive promotions from Division 3 and 2 in the 2015–16/2016-17 seasons. The 3rds or Mavericks as they are fondly known and the 4ths Strollers (the Vets team) compete in the Surrey Leagues.\nThe ladies team\nThe ladies team was founded in the 1990–91 season by Tina and John Ambler, club stewards from 1989 to 1993. Their team mascot is Alderney, one of The Wombles.\nThe first ladies match was against a selection of players from the men's teams. Due to a lack of playing experience the men emerged the victors. Since then, the Ladies section has grown from strength to strength with several of the players reaching national and international level.\nThe team currently plays in the Championship South West 2 League and has a regular squad of over thirty ladies as well as strong mini and youth section offering rugby for all ability levels from 5 to 18."

        "text": "The 2005–06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team represented George Mason University in the 2005–2006 NCAA Basketball season. The team achieved several milestones, including a team-record 23 regular season wins, and earned an at-large bid to that year's NCAA tournament.\nIn the NCAA Tournament, the Patriots reached the Final Four, becoming the first team from the Colonial Athletic Association to accomplish that feat. The number 11 seed in the East region, they advanced to the Final Four by knocking off UConn, the tournament's No. 1 overall seed, 86–84 in overtime in the Elite Eight. George Mason, which had never won an NCAA tournament game up until this tournament, thus tied the 1986 LSU Tigers as the lowest seed to ever reach the Final Four. The Patriots then lost to eventual national champions, Florida.\nAwards.\n\"First Team All-CAA\"\n\"Second Team All-CAA\"\n\"CAA All-Defensive Team\"\n\"CAA Player of the Week\"\nRecap.\nThe Patriots enjoyed their best season in 2005–2006 when they won a school-record 23 games in the regular season, and for one week were even ranked in the USA Today/ESPN Top 25 for the first time in school history. Head coach Jim Larranaga, who began his stint at George Mason in 1997, also became the CAA's all-time leader in coaching victories and was named the winner of the 2006 Clair Bee Coach of the Year Award on March 31, 2006, and the Virginia Coach of the Year on June 26, 2006, the same day he was nominated for an ESPY award. Although the team lost to Hofstra during the CAA tournament, George Mason were still able to grab an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament. This marks the first time in which the Patriots earned an at-large bid and the first time in 20 years in which the CAA sent two teams to the tournament (the other being conference tournament winner UNC Wilmington).\nThe Patriots entered the tournament as an 11th seed and defeated the 6th seeded Michigan State Spartans, who had played in the previous year's Final Four.\nIn their second round matchup against the defending champion North Carolina Tar Heels, the Patriots were once again underdogs. After falling in a 16–2 hole early in the game, the team was able to bounce back and win the game, 65–60. Their next game was against another mid-major, the Wichita State Shockers. George Mason jumped out to a big early lead, and the Shockers were not able to overcome. The Patriots won, 63–55.\nTheir Elite Eight matchup found themselves facing the Connecticut Huskies, a team that was tabbed as the favorite to win the national championship the entire season. The Patriots were able to defeat the top-seeded Huskies, 86–84 in overtime, in what is recognized as one of the most memorable games in tournament history. Their tournament run would end in Indianapolis, in a Final Four matchup with the Florida Gators, the eventual national champion in both 2006 and 2007 (with the same starting lineup both years).\nThe Patriots were the first team out of the CAA to reach the Final Four and also became the second team to reach it as a double-digit (11th) seed (the other being the LSU Tigers in 1986, also an 11th seed).\nGeorge Mason's Cinderella story ended in Indianapolis, when the eventual National Champion Florida Gators defeated them 73–58 on April 1, 2006. Despite their loss, many sports analysts considered their performance in the 2006 tourney to be the best run by a mid-major in tournament history.

        "text": "Mike Jenkins (born March 22, 1985) is an American former professional football player who was a cornerback in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the South Florida Bulls, earning All-American honors. He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft. He also played in the NFL for the Oakland Raiders, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and Arizona Cardinals.\nEarly years.\nJenkins was born in Neuenburg am Rhein, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany; his mother was a computer operator with the United States Army stationed in West Germany and left the Army when Jenkins was five. Jenkins's mother separated from his father in 1990, moved to Florida, and divorced in 1995, when he was ten.\nJenkins played high school football as a safety and running back at Southeast High School, receiving Class 3A all-state and Sarasota Herald-Tribune Defensive Player of the Year honors. He also lettered in track and field.\nCollege career.\nWhile attending the University of South Florida, Jenkins played for the South Florida Bulls football team and also ran track. He became a starter as a sophomore, registering 38 tackles, 2 interceptions, 5 passes defensed, and 2 forced fumbles. The next year, he recorded 27 tackles, 15 passes defensed, one interception and was named second-team Big East.\nIn 2007, he finished with career-highs in tackles (41), interceptions (3), tackles for loss (4) and passes defensed (16). He was a first-team Big East Conference selection and received first-team All-American honors from the American Football Coaches Association.\nHe finished his college career with 133 tackles (6 for loss), a school-record 47 passes defensed, 6 interceptions and 5 forced fumbles. He was also a kickoff returner, scoring on a 100-yard return as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\n2008 season.\nThe Dallas Cowboys traded up with the Seattle Seahawks moving from the 28th to the 25th position, in exchange for a fifth ((#163-Owen Schmitt) and seventh ((#235-Brandon Coutu) round draft choices, in order to select Jenkins in the first round of the 2008 NFL draft. On July 26, he signed a $9.725 million contract with $6.75 million guaranteed, including a $3.1 million signing bonus.\nHe was used mainly as a slot cornerback, starting 3 of his 14 games played. He finished the season with 22 tackles (17 solo), 6 passes defensed and one interception (returned for a touchdown).\n2009 season.\nIn 2009, Jenkins and fellow cornerback Orlando Scandrick competed in training camp and in the beginning of the regular season for the starter position. In week 3 against the Carolina Panthers he registered an interception, which helped him earn the starting job over Scandrick who focused on the slot corner position. He also established himself as a coverage corner by intercepting three passes in his first few starts. In a playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings, he was ineffective on two plays, allowing wide receiver Sidney Rice to score 2 touchdowns.\nJenkins finished the 2009 seasons with 5 interceptions (tied for 12th in the NFL), 23 passes defensed, 49 total tackles and was selected as an alternate to the 2009 Pro Bowl. He moved to the official line-up on January 25, 2010 when Minnesota Vikings cornerback Antoine Winfield withdrew due to injury.\n2010 season.\nJenkins recorded 55 total tackles, 15 passes defensed (led the team), 1 forced fumble, and 1 interception, while starting every game of the season.\n2011 season.\nJenkins suffered a neck stinger in training camp and missed the entire 2011 preseason. He came back from the injury and started 12 games for the Cowboys (missing 4 games with a hamstring injury), including the first 7 games, in an injury-plagued season. Jenkins fought through several injuries, including a hamstring strain, a sore shoulder and knee and a dislocated right shoulder that required off-season surgery. Overcoming the injuries, Jenkins managed to have a solid season recording 22 tackles, 10 passes defensed (led the team) and 1 interception. By fighting through injuries, he displayed toughness that had been called into question by fans and media in past seasons.\n2012 season.\nEntering the final year of Jenkins's rookie contract (which paid him around $1.05 million), the Dallas Cowboys drafted cornerback, Morris Claiborne, with the 6th overall pick in the 2012 NFL draft. The presence of Claiborne added yet another talented defensive back for the Cowboys with newly signed free agent Brandon Carr and veteran Orlando Scandrick. The Cowboys selecting Claiborne sparked immediate media speculation as to his future with the team, since Scandrick had also received a contract extension and Jenkins was on the final year of his contract.\nHe skipped the voluntary 2012 Organized Team Activities (OTAs) while rehabbing from shoulder surgery allegedly because he was unhappy with his current contract and his place on the team's depth chart.\nJenkins was supposedly hopeful he would be traded from the Cowboys and the Indianapolis Colts allegedly showed interest in him. The Dallas Cowboys' management repeatedly stated publicly they would not trade Jenkins and allegedly turned down several offers. In the first day of training camp, Jenkins clarified that he did not ask the Cowboys to be traded.\nBecause of his contract dispute, he decided to rehab his injured right shoulder outside of the team's training facilities, which delayed his recovery time, forcing him to miss all of the 2012 off-season and preseason action. Jenkins was cleared to practice by his doctor about a week before the season opener and lost his starter job to Claiborne. He played in 13 games (2 starts), and recorded 14 tackles (10 solo) and 3 passes defensed. At the end of the season, the team did not offer Jenkins a second contract because of the investment they made in Claiborne and Carr.\nOakland Raiders.\n2013 season.\nHe signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders on April 8, 2013 as a free agent, after not receiving the kind of deal he was expecting. He was named the starter at left cornerback and compiled 15 starts (missed one game with a hamstring injury), 75 tackles, 8 passes defensed, and 2 interceptions (tied for the team lead).\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\n2014 season.\nJenkins signed as a free agent with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 20, 2014. The deal was a one-year contract worth up to $1.5 million. He suffered a pectoral strain on opening day against the Carolina Panthers and was placed on the injured reserve list on September 10, 2014. He appeared in only one game during his first season in Tampa Bay.\n2015 season.\nOn March 5, 2015, Jenkins signed a one-year, $825,000 contract offer to remain with the Buccaneers, allowing him to return to compete to be a starter against Alterraun Verner and Johnthan Banks. He appeared in 14 games (5 starts), finishing with 17 total tackles and 5 pass deflections in 14 games. He was not re-signed after the season.\nArizona Cardinals.\n2016 season.\nOn July 19, 2016, Jenkins signed with the Arizona Cardinals. On August 29, 2016 Jenkins tore his ACL in a preseason game against the Houston Texans and was placed on injured reserve. He was in the mix for Arizona's starting cornerback job opposite of Patrick Peterson before the injury."

Its name was derived from the name of the principal sponsor of the team, the soft drinks manufacturer, Kas. The team was principally based in Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Its riders typically wore a jersey that consisted of yellow and blue.\nHistory.\nKas–Kaskol team.\nThe Kas team began operating in 1958, and in that year one of its riders, Fausto Izan, won a stage in the Vuelta a España. In 1959 the team signed the 1958 Spanish champion, Federico Bahamontes, who at that time had won two King of the Mountains classifications in both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. The Tour de France was disputed by national teams and Bahamontes won the Tour in 1959. Bahamontes left in 1960 but the team won the King of the Mountains in the 1960, 1961 and 1962 Vuelta a España with Antonio Karmay Mestre.\nJulio Jiménez again won the King of the Mountains in the 1964 and 1965 Vuelta a España. \"Kas–Kaskol\" dominated the 1966 Vuelta with Francisco Gabica winning, Eusebio Vélez Mendizabal second and Carlos Echeverría third. It also dominated the King of the Mountains competition with Gregorio San Miguel winning. The team won six stages and held the yellow jersey for 14 of the 18 stages.\nKas won the team prize in the 1967 and 1968 Vuelta. In 1971 the team signed the best new professional of the 1970 Vuelta, José Manuel Fuente. Fuente won the mountains classification in the 1971 Giro d'Italia and then won the Vuelta in 1972. A Kas teammate, Miguel María Lasa, was second and four other Kas riders placed in the top ten. The team won the mountains, points, and combination classifications and the team prize. It wore the yellow jersey for 17 of the 18 stages .\nFuente and his team went to the 1972 Giro d'Italia where Fuente took the maglia rosa and the race became a battle between him and Eddy Merckx in the mountains in which Merckx prevailed.\nFuente won the 1974 Vuelta, the third rider to win two editions of the race. Fuente led from the 10th stage but fell and then lost more time in the final time trial. He won by 11 seconds. Kas again won the team prize.\nThe following year Kas won the mountains, points and team classifications as well as holding the yellow jersey for 19 stages until the final time trial, when Agustín Tamames took it and left the Kas teammates Domingo Perurena and Miguel María Lasa on the lower steps of the podium. Fuente abandoned the race with problems which led to the end of his career.\nKas won the Vuelta again in 1976 with José Pesarrodona and the mountains competition with Andrés Oliva. In the 1976 Tour de France they won the team classification by placing four riders in the top 12 and three others in the top 30. They also won the team prize in the 1978 and 1979 Vuelta. In 1979 many Belgian riders joined and the chief directeur sportif was the Belgian Robert Lelangue. 1976 Tour winner Lucien Van Impe won a stage for the team in the 1979 Tour de France The sponsor then retired from the peloton.\n1980s Kas team.\nIn 1985 Kas returned as a co-sponsor of the French-based Skil–Sem team run by French directeur sportif Jean de Gribaldy. The following year Kas took over as title sponsor from Skil and the Kas jersey returned but the team remained French-based. However, the team rode more Spanish races to satisfy the new sponsor. In 1986, Sean Kelly improved on his ninth place in the 1985 Vuelta a España by coming third, winning the points jersey at the Vuelta for the third time. Kelly also won the Tour of the Basque Country and the Volta a Catalunya.\nThe team had further success in 1986 with Kelly, who was the World's number 1 rider during this period, winning 'monument' classics Milan–San Remo and Paris–Roubaix, with Acácio da Silva who won the Züri-Metzgete, and with the Swiss cyclo-cross champion, Pascal Richard.\nIn January 1987 de Gribaldy died in a car crash. After that the team became Spanish-based. In the 1987 Vuelta a España, Kelly led with three days to go when he had to withdraw due to injury. He won the event in 1988, Kas' last win in the Vuelta. After 1988 the team stopped as the team owner died in 1988 and Kas retired from sponsorship.\nKas also sponsored several Spanish cyclo-cross riders in 1980, 1993 and 1994."

His total of 51 centuries in Test matches is a world record for highest number of centuries by a batsman and his 49 centuries in ODI matches are the second highest number of centuries after Virat Kohli. He became the first and only cricketer to score 100 international centuries when he made 114 against Bangladesh in March 2012.\nAfter making his Test debut in 1989, Tendulkar achieved his first century against England at Old Trafford, Manchester in 1990; he made 119 not out. In Test matches, Tendulkar has scored centuries against all the Test cricket playing nations, and is the second batsman to score 150 against each of them. He has scored a century in at least one cricket ground of all Test cricket playing nations, except Zimbabwe. In October 2010, Tendulkar went past Brian Lara's record of 19 scores of 150 or more by hitting his 20th against Australia in Bangalore. He made his highest score in 2004, when he made 248 not out against Bangladesh at the Bangabandhu National Stadium, Dhaka. Tendulkar has scored six double centuries and remained unbeaten on 15 occasions. His centuries have come in 30 different cricket grounds, with 27 of them being scored in venues outside India. Tendulkar has been dismissed nine times between scores of 90 and 99.\nAlthough Tendulkar made his ODI debut in 1989 it took him five years to make his first century in the format. He made 110 against Australia in the third match of the Singer World Series at the R. Premadasa Stadium, Colombo in September 1994. In ODIs, Tendulkar has scored centuries against 11 different opponents. He has scored centuries against all cricketing nations that have permanent One Day International status. He was the first batsman to score a double century in ODIs, which he scored against South Africa at the Captain Roop Singh Stadium, Gwalior in 2010. He has scored 19 ODI centuries in India, compared to 30 in away or neutral venues. Seven of these centuries were hit at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium. He has been dismissed 18 times between the score of 90 and 99 and 17 times between the score of 80 and 89."

        "text": "John Brite Bowker (born July 8, 1983) is an American former professional baseball outfielder and first baseman. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Philadelphia Phillies and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Yomiuri Giants and Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. Bowker stands tall and weighs ; he bats and throws left-handed.\nBowker was drafted out of Long Beach State University in the third round of the 2004 MLB draft by the San Francisco Giants. He spent the next few years in their minor league system and ranked among the Eastern League leaders in several hitting categories in 2007. He was called up by the Giants shortly after the 2008 season began, and he became the first San Francisco-era Giant to hit a home run in his first two major league games. He was the Giants' starting first baseman for much of the season and finished the year batting .255 with 10 home runs in 111 games. In 2009, Bowker won the Pacific Coast League batting title with a .342 average. However, he batted .194 in 31 major league games. He began 2010 as the Giants' right fielder but lost the job soon after the season started. He was optioned to Fresno in June and was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates at the trade deadline. Bowker was called up by the Pirates in September and finished the 2010 season batting .219 with 5 home runs in 67 games. He started the 2011 season as a reserve outfielder on the Pirates' team but was designated for assignment and sent to the minors after April. He batted .306 with 15 home runs and 76 RBI in 106 games with their International League team before getting traded to the Philadelphia Phillies at the end of August. Used mainly as a pinch hitter, Bowker had no hits in 13 at-bats with Philadelphia. Following the season, he was released so he could sign with the Yomiuri Giants in Japan.\nEarly life.\nBowker was born to Brite and Chris Bowker on July 8, 1983, in Sacramento, California. Growing up, he attended Mariemont Elementary School, Arden Middle School, and Rio Americano High School. He began his baseball career playing for an Arden Park Little League team coached by his father, and he played baseball at Rio Americano, along with football and basketball. He decided to concentrate on baseball as a sophomore. He lettered three seasons in baseball, two seasons in football and one season in basketball in addition to being named all-league in each of these sports. He set Rio Americano's single-season records for batting average (.463) hits (41), home runs (8) and runs batted in (RBI) (41).\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from Rio Americano, Bowker enrolled at Long Beach State University. In 2004, he led the LBSU Dirtbags to the NCAA Super Regionals and was included on the 1st Team All-Big West. Bowker batted .323 in his first two years at Long Beach.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nBowker entered the 2004 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft and was selected in the third round by the San Francisco Giants.\nTo begin his minor league career, Bowker was assigned to the rookie-league Arizona League Giants. After batting .512 with 22 hits, 2 home runs, and 11 RBI in 10 games for the Giants, he was promoted to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the single-A short season Northwest League. With Salem-Keizer, he batted .323 with 41 hits, 4 home runs, and 16 RBI in 31 games. Between the AZL Giants and Salem-Keizer, he appeared in 41 games, batting .371 with 63 hits, 6 home runs, and 27 RBI in 41 games.\nIn 2005, Bowker attended Giants' spring training but was sent to the minors on March 2. He spent the season with the single-A advanced San Jose Giants. In 121 games, he had 124 hits, 27 doubles, 13 home runs, and 67 RBI while batting .267. He batted .238 with a double, a home run, and 4 RBI in 5 playoff games as San Jose won the California League championship.\nBowker attended spring training with the Giants in 2006, but he was sent to the minors on March 2. He spent most of the season with San Jose, where he batted .284 with 131 hits, 6 triples, 7 home runs, and 66 RBI in 112 games. His 32 doubles ranked tenth overall in the league. In 5 playoff games, he batted .182 with 4 hits, 2 doubles, and 1 triple. He also appeared in two games for the triple-A Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League, where he had two hits in four at bats.\nBowker attended spring training with the Giants in 2007 but only appeared in two spring training games. He spent the entire season with the Connecticut Defenders, the Giants' double-A affiliate in the Eastern League. He set career highs with 139 games played, a .307 batting average, 160 hits, 22 home runs, 90 RBI, 35 doubles, and 6 triples. He ranked seventh in the league in batting average (among qualifiers), first in games, second in hits (to Jordan Brown), fifth in doubles (tied with David Smith), fifth in triples (tied with Clete Thomas and Michael Spidale), and third in RBI (behind Jeff Larish and Oscar Salazar). His 22 home runs were tied for fifth in the league (with Salazar and Luis Jiménez) and set a Connecticut franchise record.\nEntering the 2008 season, Bowker was named the ninth best prospect in the Giants' organization by \"Baseball America\". He attended spring training again but was sent to Fresno on March 11.\nSan Francisco Giants (2008–2010).\n2008.\nOn April 11, Bowker was called up by the Giants, and he joined the team the next day after having only 3 hours of sleep the night before. In a 7–5 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals that day, he got his first hit (a single) and drove in three runs with his first home run, both against Todd Wellemeyer, as he became the eighth player in San Francisco Giants history to hit a home run in his debut. The next day, in the Giants' 7–4 victory over the Cardinals, Bowker had four RBI and hit his second home run, against Joel Piñeiro, becoming the first player in San Francisco Giants history to hit a home run in each of his first two Major League games. He had seven RBI in his first two games, the most by any major leaguer in his first two games since Joe Cunningham had seven in 1954. Bowker replaced Rich Aurilia as the Giants' starting first baseman on April 21. On June 7, he hit the first grand slam of his career, against Luis Ayala, in a 6–0 victory over the Washington Nationals. On July 2, Bowker hit a two-run \"Splash Hit\" home run into McCovey Cove against Ryan Dempster in a 6–5 loss to the Chicago Cubs. He was batting .274 before the All-Star break, but after batting .152 with two RBI in 21 games after the break, he was optioned to Fresno on August 13 to make room on the roster for Travis Ishikawa, who replaced him as the Giants' first baseman. He was recalled by the Giants on September 2 after rosters expanded.

In June, Bowker was named the Pacific Coast League player of the week for two straight weeks (May 24–31 and June 1–7) after batting .519 with five doubles, six home runs, 16 runs scored, and 18 RBI over that span. He was called up to the Giants on July 9 when Ryan Sadowski was optioned to Fresno. On July 19, he had a game-winning sacrifice fly against Zach Duke in the Giants' 4–3 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Bowker split time in left field with Randy Winn and at first base with Ishikawa, but he was returned to Fresno on July 26 so the Giants could call up Eugenio Vélez after Bowker batted .156 with 4 RBI in 11 games. He was recalled at the beginning of August but was sent back to Fresno after appearing in two games. On August 16, Bowker tied a Grizzlies' record (shared by Dante Powell) by driving in seven runs in an 8–5 victory over the Nashville Sounds. He hit three-run home runs against Tim Dillard and John Axford, and he was walked with the bases loaded by David Johnson. On September 1, he was recalled when rosters expanded. He was used mainly as a pinch-hitter until September 23, when he took over left field after Vélez was moved from left field to second base to replace the injured Freddy Sanchez. In 31 games with the Giants that year, Bowker batted .194 with 13 hits, 2 doubles, 2 triples, 2 home runs, and 7 RBI in 67 at bats. In 104 games at Fresno, he batted .342 with 125 hits, 22 doubles, 4 triples, 21 home runs, and 83 RBI. He tied for ninth in the league in home runs (with Prentice Redman) and tied for eight in RBI (with Allen Craig). He led the league in batting, becoming the first Fresno player to win the batting title since Brian Dallimore in 2003. Bowker was named to the PCL's regular-season All-Star team, post-season All-Star team, and All-PCL team.\n2010.\nAlthough Nate Schierholtz was expected to be the Giants' Opening Day right fielder in 2010, Bowker won the position after hitting six home runs in spring training. On April 7, Bowker hit a two-run home run against Brett Myers in a 10–4 victory over the Houston Astros. After batting .214 with four RBI in his first 10 games, Bowker was replaced by Schierholtz as the starting right fielder on April 17. On May 7, Bowker hit a ninth-inning game-tying home run against Francisco Rodríguez in an eventual 6–4 loss to the New York Mets. After batting .207 with 17 hits, 3 doubles, 3 home runs, and 8 RBI in 41 games, Bowker was optioned to Fresno on June 2 to make room for Pat Burrell on the roster. He was named the PCL Player of the Week from June 14 to June 21 after he had a 13-game hitting streak and a 6-game RBI streak end that week.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2010–2011).\nAfter batting .310 with 61 hits, 12 doubles, 14 home runs, and 36 RBI in 51 games with Fresno, Bowker and Joe Martinez were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates on July 31 for Javier López. Upon being acquired, Bowker was assigned by the Pirates to the Indianapolis Indians of the triple-A International League, where he batted .319 in 25 games with 29 hits, 7 doubles, 2 triples, 4 home runs, and 10 RBI. He was called up to the Pittsburgh club on September 1 as rosters expanded. By September 13, he had taken over from Lastings Milledge as the Pirates' everyday right fielder. He hit a two-run home run against Barry Enright and had three hits on September 18 in a 9–6 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Four days later, Bowker again had three hits and two RBI, including a solo home run against Kyle Lohse, in an 11–6 victory over the Cardinals. He had a pinch-hit three-run double against Mike MacDougal on September 28 in a 7–2 victory over the Cardinals. With the Pirates in 2010, Bowker batted .232 with 16 hits, 5 doubles, 2 home runs, and 13 RBI in 26 games. His major league totals from 2010 were 33 hits, 5 doubles, 8 home runs, and 21 RBI in 67 games.\nBowker made the Pirates' Opening Day roster in 2011 as a reserve oufielder. After he had 4 hits (1 double) and 2 RBI in 17 at-bats over 19 games, he was designated for assignment to make room on the roster for Xavier Paul on April 27. On May 4, he was assigned to Indianapolis after clearing waivers. In 106 games with Indianapolis, Bowker batted .306 with 129 hits, 27 doubles, 1 triple, 15 home runs, and 76 RBI (ninth in the league).\nPhiladelphia Phillies (2011).\nOn August 30, 2011, Bowker was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies for a player to be named later or cash. Bowker was used almost exclusively as a pinch-hitter with the Phillies. He had no hits in 13 at-bats with the Phillies and was left off their postseason roster. With the Phillies and Pirates in 2011, Bowker batted .133 with two RBI in 31 games.\nYomiuri Giants.\nOn January 10, 2012, Bowker was released by the Phillies in order to pursue a career in Nippon Professional Baseball. Three days later, he signed a one-year deal with the Yomiuri Giants.\nHe struggled in the regular season, having only .196 batting average, 3 home runs and 10 RBIs. But his performance in the Climax Series and Japan Series would be outstanding and were crucial to Giants' both series' Champion. Particularly in Japan Series, which included a near-miss of a tie of Japan series record of 6 RBIs in a game (which he had 5) and leading his Team with 7 RBI and 2 Home Runs. Despite losing to starting pitcher teammate Tetsuya Utsumi in Japan Series Most Valuable Player award, he was still awarded in Outstanding Player award.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nIn January 2015, Bowker signed a minor league contract with the Giants to return to playing baseball in America. Along with Ryan Vogelsong, who had played for the Orix Buffaloes, he is the second Giants draftee to return to the Giants after playing in NPB.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn June 11, 2015 Bowker was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for a PTBNL. He elected free agency on November 6.\nFukushima Hopes.\nOn May 9, 2017, Bowker signed with the Fukushima Hopes of the Baseball Challenge League. He became a free agent after the season.\nPersonal life.\nGrowing up, Bowker rooted for the San Francisco Giants, the team that drafted him. His uncle, Jeff Carmichael (who coached him growing up), helps him train during the offseason."

        "title": "Canada men's national junior ice hockey team",
        "text": "The Canadian men's national under-20 ice hockey team is the ice hockey team representing Canada internationally in under-20 competition. Their primary participation in this age group comes at the International Ice Hockey Federation's World Junior Championship, held annually every December and January. The team also participates in various exhibition matches and occasional exhibition series, such as the 2007 Super Series against their Russian counterparts, an eight-game exhibition series commemorating the 35th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series.\nThe Canadian junior team is the most successful in the world, having medalled in 34 of 46 events held since 1977, winning a record 20 gold medals. Its success can be traced back to the formation of the Program of Excellence in 1982 by the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association, which created the first true national junior team. Since that time, Canada has won 20 of 42 World Junior championships – including five in a row on two occasions, 1993–1997 and 2005–2009.\nHistory.\nEarly tournaments (1974–1981).\nThe International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) created an invitation-only junior tournament for the top ice hockey nations in the world to be held in late December 1973 and early January 1974 in Leningrad, Soviet Union. It featured six teams: the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Finland, the United States and Canada. The Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) hoped to send the defending Memorial Cup champion Toronto Marlboros to represent Canada, but after they declined, the Peterborough Petes, runner up to Toronto in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA) standings, was sent. The Petes finished third, despite being the only club team in the tournament\nA second tournament was held in 1975, primarily in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The CAHA sent an all-star team made up of players representing the Western Canada Hockey League WCHL as Canada's representative. The team finished in second place with a 4–1 record, their lone loss at the hands of the champion Soviet Union. As the OHA and WCHL had each sent a representative already, the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) sent Canada's entry in the form of the Sherbrooke Beavers for the 1976 tournament. The team finished second despite scoring only 12 goals and giving up 27 in four games\nThe growing popularity of international competition begun by the 1972 Summit Series and continued with the Canada Cup led the IIHF to formalize the tournament in 1977 as the IIHF World U20 Championship (colloquially the World Junior Hockey Championship). The defending Memorial Cup champion St. Catharines Fincups of the OHA represented Canada at this first official tournament, winning the silver medal, while Dale McCourt was named the tournament's best forward. The 1978 tournament was held in Montreal. It was the first major international tournament for Wayne Gretzky, a 16-year-old phenom whom the Montreal crowd cheered wildly. Though he led the tournament in scoring with 17 points, Canada managed only a bronze medal after losing the final round-robin game to Sweden, 6–5, in which they needed only a tie for silver.\nThe following three years yielded poor results. The 1979 team was represented primarily by the WHL's New Westminster Bruins and finished in fifth place. The CAHA nearly chose not to send a team in 1980 due to travel costs, but donations from the three major junior leagues ensured Canada's participation. The Peterborough Petes formed the primary core of the team, supplemented by players from other OHA squads. The result, however, was another fifth-place finish. The 1981 tournament was even worse, as the Cornwall Royals, with some additions from other QMJHL teams, finished in seventh place out of eight teams.\nProgram of Excellence.\nThe CAHA had long hoped to send a true national team to the tournament, but were limited by costs. To assemble such a team in 1981 would have cost four times the amount it spent to send the Cornwall Royals. The CAHA lacked the resources for such a program and preferred not to send a team at all if it couldn't send its best. However, it was in a dispute at the time with Hockey Canada and feared that if it did not send a team, the IIHF would turn to the rival governing body instead. Though the CAHA typically sent the defending Memorial Cup champion, those teams were typically weakened by the loss of graduating players and were often only a shadow of the team which won their championships. Disappointed by frequent complaints from European teams that the Canadian juniors were just \"slugs\" who couldn't play the game at an elite level, CAHA president Murray Costello finally set out to build a true national team program.\nKnown as the \"Program of Excellence\", Costello and the CAHA proposed a multifaceted approach that would see Canada send its top eligible juniors from across the nation. It included the creation of U-17 and U-18 programs to develop younger players and a summer training camp to evaluate potential players for the junior team. The three major-junior leagues were initially reluctant to support the proposal, as it would have required them to surrender their top players for a longer period for the tournament, as well as their younger players for regional development tournaments. The CAHA ultimately gained the support of each league, but not before having to also convince them to allow the organization to also invite eligible players from outside major junior hockey.\nThe team that was sent to the 1982 Tournament in Rochester, Minnesota was the first true national junior team sent. It was composed of ten players from the WHL, four from the OHL, three from the QMJHL, two playing United States college and one playing professionally in the Finnish league. The team lacked star players, but relied on a balanced offence and strong defence to post a 6–0–1 record in the round robin tournament. Canada defeated the Soviet Union 7–0 in the second-to-last game, the worst defeat the Soviets suffered in the tournament's history. The game was played at the Winnipeg Arena before a rabid crowd, which amazed the players. The Canadians entered the final game, against Czechoslovakia, guaranteed a silver medal, and needed only a tie to win gold. Played at a half-full arena in Rochester, the Czechs entered the third period leading 2–1, and would have had a larger lead if not for goaltender Mike Moffat. Two third-period goals gave Canada the lead before the Czechs tied it. They held on despite a frenzied attack in the final minutes to end with a 3–3 tie, and win Canada's first gold medal in the tournament's history.\nThe arena either did not have a copy of the Canadian anthem, or had technical difficulty with it, so was unable to follow the IIHF tradition of playing the winning team's anthem following the game. The players themselves chose to sing the anthem, badly off-key, an image that has since become an iconic moment in the junior program's history. The gold medal marked the first international amateur championship for Canada in 20 years, and established the value of the Program of Excellence.\nRivalry with the Soviet Union (1983–1991).\nAttempting to repeat as champions in 1983, Canada endured numerous incidents and mind games perpetrated by the host Soviet Union. The Soviets initially refused to grant a sufficient number of visas for the Canadian delegation, then when the team landed in Leningrad, had their clothing and equipment seized immediately by government officials. It was returned three hours later, but only after the team threatened to withdraw from the tournament. Canada's first three games, all wins, were played in a small, empty arena. The fourth game was against the hosts in a larger rink at full capacity, which the team was denied the ability to practice in beforehand. The players struggled to adapt to the new playing conditions, losing 7–3, and even surrendered a goal when they mistook a whistle from somewhere in the crowd for the referees whistle and stopped playing. The Canadians finished with the bronze medal. The game against the Soviets was a much closer affair in the following year, ending in a 3–3 tie. However, Canada needed a win in the game to retain a chance for gold. Left with bronze as the best possibility, the disheartened Canadians lost to Czechoslovakia in the final game of the tournament and finished in fourth place.\nCanada and Czechoslovakia entered their contest on the final day of the 1985 tournament in Sweden with identical 5–0–1 records. Playing for the gold medal, the game was dominated by the goaltenders: Craig Billington and Dominik Hašek. It ended in a 2–2 draw and Canada claimed gold in the round-robin tournament as a result of a better goal differential. It was the nation's first World Championship won on European ice in 24 years. With 5–0 records, Canada and the Soviet Union again faced off for the gold medal in their match-up at the 1986 in Hamilton. The Soviets emerged 4–1 victors and won the gold, while Canada finished as silver medalists.\nBelieving that the Canada-Soviet match-up would again determine who won gold, the Czechoslovak hosts scheduled the two teams to be the final game of the 1987 tournament. It did not turn out that way, as the Soviets struggled and were eliminated from contention. However, Canada could win silver with a victory, or gold with a victory of 5 or more goals. Norwegian referee Hans Rønning, assigned based on his neutrality despite his inexperience officiating at the international level, quickly lost control as both teams frequently hacked and slashed each other. Midway through the second period, with Canada leading 4–2, a line brawl broke out that ultimately involved nearly every player for both teams after the Soviets left their bench, closely followed by the Canadians. The melee lasted 20 minutes, ending only when the players were too exhausted to continue fighting. The brawl, which became known as the Punch-up in Piestany, resulted in the disqualification of Canada and the Soviet Union.\nPlayers who were on the 1987 team entered the 1988 tournament in Moscow seeking redemption. They won the gold medal, finishing the tournament at 6–0–1. The 3–2 victory over the Soviet Union was the difference maker, dropping the tournament hosts to the silver medal. Canada would achieve the same feat at the 1990 and 1991 tournaments, capturing back-to-back gold medals for the first time, hinging on crucial wins over the Soviet Union. This ultimately broke the tie in points at the top of the standings each time, leaving the Soviets with silver.\nGolden years (1993–1997).\nFrom 1993 through to 1997, Canada won a record five-straight gold medals. The streak started under difficult circumstances beginning at the 1993 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships in Sweden, one of the most competitive engagements in tournament history. The host Swedes, led by Peter Forsberg, Markus Näslund, and Niklas Sundström, broke scoring records. In 1995, the host Canadians benefited from a squad bolstered by the 1994–95 NHL lockout, resulting in a perfect record \"en route\" to winning gold. The streak culminated at the 1997 tournament in Switzerland, with excellent defence and goaltending covering for an offence that struggled early in the competition.\nMedal streak (1999–2012).\nAt the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Canada won silver as hosts in Winnipeg, dropping a 3–2 final in overtime to a powerful, deep Russian team. The tournament set records for attendance. This would also be the start of another unrivaled display of junior hockey by Canada, claiming 14-straight medals from 1999–2012, including their second run of five-straight gold medals from 2005 through to 2009. At the 2009 tournament in Ottawa, where Team Canada last captured gold, Canada faced defeat against Russia in the final seconds of their semi-final before Jordan Eberle scored the equalizing goal with 5.4 seconds remaining in the game, forcing overtime. Canada would win in a shootout and go on to rout Sweden 5–1 in the final. John Tavares, the future first overall selection at the 2009 NHL Entry Draft, was named most valuable player of the tournament.\nSexual assault allegations (2022).\nThe team's players and Hockey Canada were the subject of allegations of sexual assault after the team visited London, Ontario in 2018, celebrating their gold medal at the 2018 World Championship. After an investigation by the London police, former team members Dillon Dube, Cal Foote, Alex Formenton, Carter Hart, and Michael McLeod were charged with sexual assault in late January 2024.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2024 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.

The 1974 team was represented by the Peterborough Petes. Canada was ejected from the tournament in 1987 for a bench clearing brawl with the Soviet Union. In 1996, a playoff was added to the tournament (prior to this, it was just a round robin tournament.) Playoff games are included in record. Since 2007, the IIHF has awarded 3 points for a win, 2 points for an overtime win and 1 point for an overtime loss.\n† Includes one win in extra time (in the preliminary round)\n‡ Includes one loss in extra time (in the preliminary round)\n+ Includes one loss in extra time (in the playoff round)\nSuper Series.\nIn 2007, the Canadian junior team played the Russian junior team in an eight-game Super Series commemorating the 35th anniversary of the 1972 Summit Series. For the 40th anniversary, the two teams competed in a four-game series in August 2012. The two teams split the series, which was decided on an overtime goal by Ryan Strome after Game 4.\nAwards and honours.\nCanadian players have earned numerous honours throughout the history of the World Junior Championship.\nReferences.\nFootnotes\nGeneral"

        "text": "Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery is a novel by Richard Brautigan written in 1975.\nThe story takes place in San Francisco, California in the early 1970s. The title character is a papier-mâché bird that shares the front room of a San Francisco apartment with a collection of bowling trophies that some time earlier were stolen from the home of the Logan brothers. The human tenants of this apartment are John and Pat, who have just returned from seeing a Greta Garbo movie in a local movie theater. Their neighbors are Bob and Constance, a married couple going through some rough times in their relationship. Because of their failing relationship, Bob becomes depressed. Meanwhile, the Logan brothers are looking for their bowling trophies stolen three years earlier. The brothers have turned their happy life of bowling into a life of vengeance. Brautigan tried to have all the main characters in the story have an intersection that is comically sad.\nRichard Brautigan got the name Willard in the novel from his friend Stanley Fullerton's papier-mâché bird named Willard and, in fact, a bird is on the front cover of the novel.\nIn 2018, filmmaker Kansas Bowling and musician Kat Meoz shot the only existing footage of the real Willard for a music video for Meoz's song \"Here I Wait\"."

        "text": "\"For the American comic book artist, see Wayne Howard.\"\nWayne Howard (born April 30, 1931) is a former American football coach. He was head coach at UC Riverside from 1972 to 1973, Long Beach State from 1974 to 1976 and Utah from 1977 to 1981. He had a career college football record of 70–37–2.\nEarly life.\nA native of Denver, Howard attended Jordan High School in Long Beach, California before transferring in his senior year to Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, from which he graduated in 1948. He played college baseball at the University of Redlands in Redlands, California, graduating in 1957 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. His time at Redlands was interrupted by five years of military service as a flying officer in the United States Air Force.\nCoaching career.\nUtah lured Howard away from Long Beach State after three winning seasons as head coach there. During his five seasons at Utah, his winning percentage of .554 was better than that of his predecessor, Tom Lovat (.152), and his successor, Chuck Stobart (.489).\nHis final season at Utah, Howard had the Utes in contention to win the Western Athletic Conference championship, needing to win the final game against BYU to take the title. He retired after losing to BYU, but he was not clear why. He later said, \"I just did. No real reason. I wasn't unhappy. I was not treated badly. I really never tried to get another job. I liked it there. They treated me well.\"\nBYU rivalry.\nDuring the BYU game in 1977, BYU head coach LaVell Edwards put starting quarterback Marc Wilson back into the game with two minutes remaining so that Wilson could set a then NCAA record for 571 passing yards in a game. BYU won 38–8. After the game, Howard said, \"This today will be inspiring. The hatred between BYU and Utah is nothing compared to what it will be. It will be a crusade to beat BYU from now on. This is a prediction: in the next two years Utah will drill BYU someday, but we won’t run up the score even if we could set an NCAA record against them.\" The next year Howard made good on his promise, upsetting BYU 23–22.\nIn an interview after retiring, Howard hinted that he did not like aspects of the BYU rivalry. \"There's too much religion involved,\" he said referring to the fact that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns BYU, and many fans of the two schools inject religion into the rivalry. \"I did not like that. I really didn't."

        "title": "1929 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1929 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game and the 15th annual Rose Bowl Game. Played on January 1, 1929, the game saw the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (also known at the time as the Georgia Tech Golden Tornado) defeat the California Golden Bears by a score of 8–7. The game was notable for a play in which Cal's All-American center Roy Riegels scooped up a Georgia Tech fumble and ran in the wrong direction towards his own goal line, earning him the dubious nickname, \"Wrong Way\". The two-point safety on the ensuing punt proved to be the margin of victory. Riegels' teammate Benny Lom, who attempted to tackle Riegels on the run, was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively.\nTeams.\nGeorgia Tech Yellow Jackets.\nThis was the first appearance for Georgia Tech in a post season bowl game. They had run through their regular season schedule. This included a 13–0 win over Notre Dame and a 20–6 win over Georgia in the Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate rivalry game. They were named national champion by two organizations. They were invited by the Tournament of Roses committee to play in the game.\nCalifornia Golden Bears.\nCalifornia was not the Pacific Coast Conference champion in 1928. The 1928 USC Trojans, under coach Howard Jones, were the PCC champions, and also were named a national champion. They were undefeated with a 9–0–1 record. The lone blemish on the Trojans' record came at Cal, who had tied USC 0–0 on October 20. USC had defeated Notre Dame 27–14, the only common opponent with Georgia Tech. The University of Southern California declined the bid to play in the Rose Bowl. California, the second place team with a 3–0–2 conference record appeared instead to represent the Pacific Coast Conference. After tying USC, Cal had lost to the Olympic Club \"Winged Os\". The Bears beat Oregon, Washington and Nevada. They tied Stanford 13–13 in the 1928 Big Game. The Stanford Indians had appeared in the 1928 Rose Bowl where they defeated Pittsburgh 7–6, having been selected controversially over USC the year before.\nThe game.\nOn January 1, 1929, the Golden Bears faced the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. Midway through the second quarter, Cal's Roy Riegels, who played center, picked up a fumble by Tech's Stumpy Thomason. Just 30 yards away from the Yellow Jackets' end zone, Riegels was somehow turned around and ran 65 yards in the wrong direction. \nTeammate and quarterback Benny Lom chased Riegels, screaming at him to stop. Known for his speed, Lom finally caught up with Riegels at California's 3-yard line and tried to turn him around, but he was immediately hit by a wave of Tech players and tackled back to the 1-yard line. The Bears chose to punt rather than risk a play so close to their own end zone, but Tech's Vance Maree blocked Lom's punt for a safety, giving Georgia Tech a 2–0 lead.\nRiegels was so distraught that he had to be talked into returning to the game for the second half. Lom passed for a touchdown and kicked the extra point, and Riegels blocked a Tech punt in the second half, but Tech would win the game—and their second national championship—by a final score of 8–7.\nAftermath.\nAfter the game, coach Nibs Price defended Riegels, saying \"It was an accident that might have happened to anyone.\" Price credits Riegels as the smartest player he ever coached. Riegels explained that he was hit during a pivot and wound up doing a U-turn, which faced him the opposite direction. Later, the NCAA football rules committee would pass a rule barring a player from advancing a recovered fumble once it hits the ground. Riegels would take his spot as captain during his senior year, earning All-America honors.\nDespite the nationwide mockery that followed, Riegels went on to live a normal life, serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II, coaching high school, and college football—including time at Cal—and running his own chemical company. He was even able to capitalize on his blunder, parodying the now-famous run in vaudeville acts. Riegels was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame in 1991.\nThe character of \"Lefty\" Phelps in the movie \"Flight\" (1929), directed by Frank Capra, is based on Riegels and uses the incident to propel Phelps into the Marine Corps. The opening sequence uses photographs of Riegels during the actual Rose Bowl game.\nBenny Lom was named Most Valuable player of the game retroactively when the award was instituted in 1953.\nRiegels used his experience to encourage others who had made similar plays. In 1957, Paramount High School's Jan Bandringa had intercepted a pass only to run it 55 yards into his own end zone, resulting in a safety for Centennial High, who won the game 9–7. In a regular season game in 1964, Jim Marshall of the Minnesota Vikings also ran a recovered fumble into his own end zone. Both received word of encouragement from Riegels.\nIn 1971, Tech's entire 1928 team was inducted into the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame. Roy Riegels and teammate Benny Lom attended as special guests. The Georgia Tech Letterman's Club presented Riegels and Lom with membership cards.\nIn 1991, Riegels was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame. Riegels died in 1993, at the age of 84. In 1998, he was posthumously elected to Cal's Hall of Fame.\nIn 2003, a panel from the College Football Hall of Fame and CBS Sports chose Riegels' \"Wrong way run in the Rose Bowl\" one of six \"Most Memorable Moments of the Century.\""

        "text": "John Hilton (born 25 June 1947) is a retired table tennis player best known for winning the singles event at the Table Tennis European Championships in 1980 despite being a relatively unknown amateur player. His use of a revolutionary combination bat with different rubbers on either side, coupled with his defensive play, led to one of sport's greatest upsets. At the time of his victory John trained at the Manchester YMCA, where he was only ranked at number 4, despite being ranked at number 1 in Europe and number 5 in the world. His odds of winning the tournament were rated at 1,000–1.\nUltimately, the table tennis authorities had to change the rules because of Hilton, so that either side of a bat had different coloured rubbers. This gave the opposing player the chance to spot which rubber their opponent was using. Hilton used a bat which had black rubber (one side antispin, the other side very spinny) on both sides, meaning that opponents generally had no clue which rubber he was using when he 'twiddled' his bat in mid-rally, especially when his sleight of hand was coupled with him squeaking the soles of his shoes on the floor at the moment of bat on ball impact to mask the slight difference in sound between the antispin and spinny surfaces.\nHilton still plays table tennis in the Bolton league, which his team won in the 2012–13 season. John has won many Veteran titles and to date, is the only British player to have won the gold medal in the Men's Singles event at the Table Tennis European Championships."

Indonesia is one of the only two countries beside China who has won all badminton discipline in the Olympic Games.\nThe Indonesian team has not been absent from the Thomas Cup tournament (world men's team championship) since it first entered and won the competition in 1958. The Indonesia men's team has participated in Thomas Cup 28 times, won the title 14 times and never failed to qualify for inter-zone competition. Indonesia has played in the decisive final tie on 21 occasions and once failed to place among the top four teams in 2012.\nThe Indonesia women's team has participated in Uber Cup 25 times, won the title 3 times and once failed to qualify in 2006. Indonesia has played in the decisive final tie on 10 occasions.\nThe Indonesia mixed team has won Sudirman Cup once in 1989. Indonesia has played in the decisive final tie on 7 occasions.\nParticipation in World Badminton Championships.\nThe BWF World Championships (formerly known as IBF World Championships, also known as the World Badminton Championships) is a badminton tournament sanctioned by Badminton World Federation (BWF).\nThe tournament started in 1977 and was held once every three years until 1983. Below is the gold medalists shown based by category and countries after the 2013 Championships. China has been the most successful in the World Championships ever since its inception in 1977. From 1977 up to 2001, the medals were usually divided among five countries, namely Indonesia, China, Korea, Denmark, Malaysia. However, in 2003, the winners included seven countries and in 2005 the medal board contained a record high of ten countries. Indonesians Tony Gunawan also bears the distinction of winning a gold medal in Men's Doubles, representing two different countries, 2001 partnering with Halim Haryanto for Indonesia and in 2005 partnering with Howard Bach to give the United States its first medal in the competition.\nParticipation in Thomas Cup, Uber Cup and Sudirman Cup.\nIndonesia leads in total titles with fourteen. It won four consecutive titles from 1970 through 1979 and five consecutive titles from 1994 through 2002. Indonesia's ten-year reign as Champions was ended by the resurgence of China in 2004 when the Chinese won the title in Jakarta. Indonesia has played in the decisive final tie (men's team match) on nineteen occasions. Since the Thomas Cup format was overhauled in 1984, it has failed to place among the top four teams only once, in 2012.\nSquads.\nSudirman Cup.\n2023\n2021\n2019\n2017\n2015\n2013\n2011\n2009\n2007\n2005\n2003\n2001\n1999\n1997\n1995\n1993\n1991\n1989\nParticipation in Badminton Asia Championships.\nIndividual competition.\n\"BOLD highlights the overall winner therefore at that Asia Team Championships\"\nMen's doubles supremacy.\nEven though they actually have a balance of strength in all events, they are known for producing many great doubles in the men's category. Their doubles had conquered the Olympic Gold Medal, World Champion titles, All Englands and many open titles over decades. Among their greats are Tjun Tjun, Christian Hadinata, Eddy Hartono, Rexy Mainaky, Ricky Subagja, Candra Wijaya, Tony Gunawan, Sigit Budiarto, Markis Kido and Hendra Setiawan. Despite their domination, the national badminton governing body is also known for their awkward splitting decision. It happened twice in the Thomas Cup and thrice in the Olympics. Indonesia leads in total titles with fourteen. It won four consecutive titles from 1970 through 1979 and five consecutive titles from 1994 through 2002. Indonesia's ten-year reign as champions was ended by the resurgence of China in 2004 when the Chinese won the title in Jakarta. Indonesia has played in the decisive final tie (team match) on eighteen occasions. Since the Thomas Cup format was overhauled in 1984, it has failed to place among the top four teams only once, in 2012.\nIn 1986, they chose to field King/Ertanto instead of the more solid King/Kartono, considering that Kartono always played badly against the Chinese. In 2004, they fielded weak doubles against strong Danish pairs. Because of those decisions, they lost the match. As for the Olympics, they didn't do anything to maintain the Halim/Tony partnership and Tony G quit the national team. They also split the Candra/Sigit combination months before the 2004 Games. Four years later in Beijing they deselected Tony G/Candra in favor of Luluk/Alvent. For the London Games, the same thing repeated once more due to their decision in deceiving reigning Olympics Gold Medalists Markis/Hendra. The 2005 edition also brought new faces in the mixed doubles event which had been dominated by China and Korea since 1997. With the retirement of defending champions and two-time winners Kim Dong-moon/Ra Kyung-min (Korea), Nova Widianto/Lilyana Natsir won Indonesia's first mixed doubles gold since 1980 when Christian Hadinata/Imelda Wiguna won it last for Indonesia. In 2020 after almost 20 years, Indonesia managed to become the champion of the Thomas Cup for the 14th time. This 14th title makes Indonesia the country with the most Thomas Cup titles."

        "title": "National Golf Links of America",
        "text": "National Golf Links of America is a prestigious links-style golf course in Southampton, New York, located on Long Island between Shinnecock Hills Golf Club and Peconic Bay. Though the course is noted for hosting the initial Walker Cup in 1922, which the United States won 8 and 4, it has never hosted a major men's championship. The Walker Cup was again held at the National in 2013. The private club has been called \"America's snootiest golf course\" due to its exclusive nature.\nHistory.\nThe course was designed by Charles B. Macdonald, who had been schooled at the University of St Andrews in Scotland during the 1870s. Macdonald was introduced to golf at St. Andrews old course, playing many rounds there with Tom Morris, Sr. and Tom Morris, Jr., both of whom were multiple winners of the Open Championship, founded in 1860 as the first major championship in golf.\nMacdonald, the founder and original designer of the Chicago Golf Club, had been paired with John Shippen, an African American, in the 1896 U.S. Open at Shinnecock Hills. Following the event, he quit Shinnecock and founded the new club. He set out to design a course that would rival the prominent golf courses located abroad, looking at potential sites in Cape Cod and Napeague before settling on a plot of land on Sebonac Neck next to Peconic Bay. Macdonald relied on his extensive knowledge of Britain's finest holes, using them as templates for his new course.\nThe course was constructed adjacent to Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, and now also borders Sebonack Golf Club, which opened in 2006. Construction of the golf course was supervised by Seth Raynor, a local civil engineer from Long Island who went on to design several golf courses of his own, including the Fishers Island Club.\nWhen it opened in 1911, the course was called the \"National Golf Links of America\" because its 67 founding members, which included Robert Bacon, George W. Baxter, Urban H. Broughton, Charles Deering, James Deering, Findlay S. Douglas, Henry Clay Frick, Elbert Henry Gary, Clarence Mackay, De Lancey Nicoll, James A. Stillman, Walter Travis, and William Kissam Vanderbilt II, resided in various parts of the United States. The clubhouse was designed by Jarvis Hunt, one of the club's founding members. James Hepburn—one of the founding members of the PGA of America—served as one of the early head professionals, working at the club from 1914 until 1928. There is a small bar half-way round the course which contains P.G. Wodehouse memorabilia, and the course is mentioned, surprisingly negatively, in the preface to The Heart of a Goof short story collection.\nThe National Golf Links of America was selected as the host of the 2013 Walker Cup in September 2008. In 2009, \"The National\" was ranked 15th in \"Golf Digest\"'s list of America's 100 Greatest Golf Courses.\nThe current head golf professional is Jim Morris.\nOn April 18, 2018, the right wing of the building caught fire, but was extinguished by local fire departments causing minimal damage to the exterior.\nCourse design.\nNational Golf Links of America is laid out over . The course is a par 72 and plays from the back tees. Many of the holes were patterned from famous golf courses in the British Isles and adapted to fit the local setting:\nSome of the other holes were original designs, the most notable of which is the par four 14th hole. It was named \"Cape\" because the green was located on a small peninsula that jutted into a bay. The green was later moved during construction of Sebonac Inlet Road but is now surrounded on three sides by a large bunker. A unique feature on the golf course is a windmill located between the 2nd and 16th holes. A member once remarked that a windmill would make a nice addition to the course, so Macdonald purchased one when he was in Europe and sent the member the bill."

        "title": "Lumpinee Boxing Stadium",
        "text": "Lumpinee Boxing Stadium () is a sporting arena in Bangkok, Thailand. Opened more than a decade later than Rajadamnern Stadium, Lumpinee is run by the Royal Thai Army. It has become the symbol of modern Muay Thai. Only Rajadamnern Stadium rivals the prestige of holding the title of \"Muay Thai Champion of Lumpinee\". The ranking system and championship titles are held from mini flyweight (105 lb) up to super welterweight (154 lb).\nMuay Thai bouts are held on Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. The fights usually start around 18:00.\nThe final event at its original site on Rama IV Road near Lumphini Park was held on 8 February 2014. The stadium then moved to its new home on Ram Intra Road which can hold up to 5,000 spectators. The new stadium held the first fight on 11 February 2014 and was officially opened on 28 February 2014.\nHistory.\nGeneral Praphas Charusathien was the driving force behind the construction of the Lumpinee Stadium, the second national stadium built in Thailand after Rajadamnern. Lumpinee opened its doors on 8 December 1956. The stadium is operated by the Army Welfare Department of the Royal Thai Army. All proceeds from the fights go towards supporting the various departments of the Thai Army. The board of directors, headed by Army Commander Apirat Kongsompong, consists entirely of army officers.\nEleven promoters are responsible for booking boxers to fight at the stadium. The rules are the same as at Rajadamnern: boxers must weigh more than 100 lb (45.4 kg), older than 15 years, with a weight difference between boxers of not more than a . Women are not allowed to fight in the stadium or enter the ring.\nOne of the most famous Lumpinee champions was Dieselnoi Chor Thanasukarn who reigned without defeat in the early-1980s, holding the Lightweight title for four years. He was eventually forced to retire because he ran out of opponents.\nLumpinee Stadium was implicated in a cluster of COVID-19 cases during the coronavirus pandemic in Thailand in 2020. Boxing matches were held on 6 March 2020 in spite of a government shutdown order issued on 3 March. Among those later stricken by COVID-19 was the chief of the Army Welfare Department, who had been at the stadium.\nIn early 2021, it was reported that the Army was considering releasing the stadium to the private sector, or turning the stadium into a museum. In response to this, Lumpinee management announced their intention to re-brand and implement major changes. These changes included allowing women to fight in the stadium, begin hosting mixed martial arts bouts and ban gambling in order to attract a non-gambling audience.\nTraditionally reserved for male fighters, Lumpinee Stadium eventually hosted its first female fight card on November 13, 2021. The main event featured Buakaw Mor.Kor.Chor.Chaiyaphum facing Sanaejan Sor.Jor.Tongprajin for the WBC Muaythai mini flyweight championship and Lumpinee Stadium women's mini flyweight championship, with Sanaejan winning by decision. \nHaving long been a venue for Muay Thai, Lumpinee Stadium made history by holding its first mixed martial arts event on January 16, 2022, hosted by Fairtex Fight Promotion. The event consisted of both Muay Thai and MMA fights. In August 2022 it began hosting ONE Championship events, with nearly all fights under Muay Thai rules.\nNotable champions.\nOnly six non-Thai athletes have become Lumpinee champions.\nThe first winner was French-Algerian fighter Morad Sari, who claimed the super lightweight championship in 1999. French fighter Damien Alamos won the super lightweight title in 2012 and was the first foreigner to defend the belt later that year. France's Rafi Bohic, won the welterweight title in 2017 and defended the belt four times. Moroccan-Belgian Youssef Boughanem won the middleweight title in 2018. Japan's Nadaka Yoshinari became mini flyweight champion in 2019, though he won the belt at an event in Japan. The last non-Thai fighter to win the belt was Jimmy Vienot in 2019 at middleweight. A number of non-Thais have achieved top 10 rankings within the stadium. Ramon Dekkers was one of the most renowned foreign fighters in Lumpinee history, but he never won the Lumpinee belt. Stéphane Nikiéma would have been the second foreign Lumpinee champion, but his title fight ended in a no-contest."

        "title": "Test match (rugby union)",
        "text": "A test match in rugby union is an international match, usually played between two senior national teams, that is recognised as such by at least one of the teams' national governing bodies.\nSome teams do not represent a single country but their international games are still considered test matches (for example the British and Irish Lions). Likewise some countries award caps for games between their full national teams and some invitation teams such as the Barbarians.\nHistory.\nThe first men's international game of rugby football – between Scotland and England – was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, the home ground of Edinburgh Academicals, on 27 March 1871. (This was six years before the first cricket test match, one year before the first association football international and 24 years before the first field hockey international.)\nThe first recorded use of the word in relation to sport occurs in 1861 when it was used, especially by journalists, to designate the most important (but at that stage non-international) games played as part of a cricket tour by an unofficial English team to Australia and it is thought to arise from the idea that the matches were a \"test of strength and competency\" between the sides involved. When official and fully representative Australian and English cricket and rugby teams began touring each other's countries a decade or so later the term gradually began to be applied by journalists exclusively to the international fixtures on each tour, though this was not widespread until well into the 1880s.\nRecognising official test status.\nUnlike in cricket, whose governing body, the International Cricket Council, tightly controls the application of \"test match\" status, World Rugby's regulations do not define a \"test match\". They define an \"international match\" as \"a Match played between National Representative Teams selected by Unions\". In rugby union, test match status and caps may be awarded by either team's governing body regardless of the decision of their opponents.\nAlthough both teams' governing bodies do not need to recognise the match as a test match for caps to be awarded, it is rare that they should disagree. The only existing example remaining in men's rugby involving two top-tier nations concerns games played by the New South Wales Waratahs against the New Zealand All Blacks in the 1920s. As there was very little rugby union played in Australia outside of New South Wales, the Australian Rugby Union retroactively awarded caps to the players from the 1920s Waratahs that played against the All Blacks, however the New Zealand Rugby Union has not done the same for All Blacks that played in those matches. \nDifferences in recognition now almost always involve matches between the senior national team of a nation outside the traditional top tier and an official developmental side of a top-tier nation. Depending on the policy of the lower-tier union, these matches may or may not be fully capped for that national team. For example, before a change in policy by USA Rugby after the 2008 Churchill Cup, it awarded full national caps when its senior national team played developmental sides, such as England Saxons, Ireland Wolfhounds, Scotland A, Argentina A and the Junior All Blacks.\nHowever, in women's rugby matters are less clear. The first women's \"test\" took place in 1982 between the Netherlands and France, but the sport was not widely accepted or recognised by many existing national Unions or the International Rugby Board for many years, nor had it attracted significant media interest. Some unions do not officially recognise any tests played before they became responsible for the women's game – for example the French Union (FFR) does not list any games before 1989, and the IRB did not (until recently) recognise the first two women's World Cups."

        "title": "Major League Baseball 2K9",
        "text": "Major League Baseball 2K9, or MLB 2K9 for short, is an MLB-licensed baseball simulation video game published by 2K. The game was developed for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Portable and Wii. The game was released on March 3, 2009, to mixed-to-positive reviews.\nGameplay.\nNew features were implemented for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions. Pitching had been simplified from \"2K8\" to \"2-step pitching\", with \"hold and gesture\", eliminating the third \"Release Timing\" step of \"2K8\", simplifying the motion while retaining the style. \"Meatballs\" (mistake pitches) have been removed - instead, badly released pitches will be less effective (fastballs will be straighter, curveballs will hang, and so forth.) The AI's pitch selection was also improved. (Players may elect to use the third step as an option, and users may also still use the older Precision Pitching from \"2K7\".) \"Influence hitting\" allowed users to control fly and ground balls, and bunt with improved precision. The developers added a zone hitting feature, improved hit distribution, and improved fielding realism and AI. Also added is the ability to cancel a throw and hold the ball, or pump fake during a rundown. A player can also attempt a \"Quick Throw\" which gets the ball to a base faster but also increases the chance of an error. Baserunning control has been simplified; a player only needs to hold down the trigger until it vibrates, for instance, then release it when ready to attempt a steal. There are also separate \"Steal\" and \"Speed\" ratings for runners.\nThe ballpark realism has been changed as well. Players graphically move from the dugout to the batter's box, from the bullpen to the mound, warm up by throwing around the horn, swing the bat in the on deck circle, run out to their positions, and so forth. Umpires, ball boys, and coaches will perform their actions, while fans react realistically. For example, foul balls will cause people in the crowd to jump out of their seats and try to catch the ball, however some fans that have no real chance to get the ball will make a foolish jump in the air. Stadiums will have their unique fan signatures; for example, Turner Field will have the Tomahawk Chop while Tropicana Field will have the Cow Bell. Players will react properly to such events as a walk-off home run, a no-hitter or a World Series celebration. There are also 300 new Signature Style animations. Rain delays have also been mentioned. Arguing with the umpires is not featured in the Xbox 360 version of the game or the PS3 version.\nThe game also had \"Living Rosters\", active rosters that are automatically updated when the user logs in online; players' ratings will be constantly updated, while up-to-date trades and acquisitions will be reflected in-game. Living Rosters are not active during Franchise mode, however. The game also features a revamped stat simulation engine for the Franchise mode, while players' career arcs are based on how they play rather than preset stat curves. In other words, in order for a rookie to develop, he must receive playing time - he will not develop if he sits on the bench. An entire season can be simulated in a matter of minutes. Other improvements to the Franchise mode include adding a new revamped trade simulator and over 200 individual MLB.com headlines. \"2K9\"’s franchise mode allows for 30 user controlled teams. The mode also has added stats; for example they have included wins divided by teams' payroll.\nThe game has been updated with an MLB.com-licensed in-game \"Virtual Director\" website featuring a presentation style similar to \"NBA 2K9\", where the user may check up on league events, trade rumors, player and team performances. The game has improved upon \"2K8\"'s Inside Edge scouting system. The game boasts a new level of CPU customization, multi-player functionality, and real player ambitions; for example, Milton Bradley can decline a contract because of lack of playing time, not for monetary considerations. Record-breaking and milestone performances, whether single game, season or career, are acknowledged with headlines and snapshots of the event. There is also a new gameplay mode, \"Playoff Mode\", in which the user only plays in the postseason. The PC version, like its \"NBA 2K9\" counterpart, will not feature online play or Living Rosters. Unlike \"MLB 2K6\", \"2K9\" will not feature the 2009 World Baseball Classic.\nIn other improvements, users can now add SFX and graphic overlays to in-game replays to create highlight reels, as well as upload the reel to 2KSports.com, while online users' performances are graphed out, displayed in chart form, and can be compared against league averages. The Topps Trading Cards system from \"2K8\" has been improved, while the Home Run Derby mode has also been revamped. Unlike the previous \"MLB\" titles, there are no pre-rendered cutscenes; all cutscenes are done in real-time with in-game assets.\nThe game also implements PlayStation 3 Trophies, while Xbox 360 Achievements are represented as trophies in-game.\nThe Wii, PlayStation 2, and PlayStation Portable versions are not as fully featured as on the primary platforms, but have their own platform-specific features. The Wii version takes advantage of the Wii Remote, with \"Wii Remote pitching\" (players use the Wii Remote to control every pitch) and \"Wiimote hitting\" (players use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk for hitting, allowing the player to place their hits in relation to their swing timing, swing speed and swing angle.) The PlayStation 2 allows a player to control up to 4 different franchises simultaneously, and will allow PS2 online play. The PSP version features \"True to Form Fielding\", featuring improved fielding control and single player control. It also has a minor league farm system, allowing AAA scouting and managing, as well as allowing the player to play full games with AAA clubs.\nCommentators.\n\"MLB 2K9\" has a new broadcasting team with Gary Thorne providing the play-by-play and Steve Phillips filling in the color commentary. The duo replaces Jon Miller and Joe Morgan, who had been the commentators in past \"2K\" installments for the previous 4 years. All four personalities are regular ESPN Major League Baseball broadcasters. Fox Sports' Jeanne Zelasko and Steve Physioc remain the reporters, giving 7th inning and post game updates, as well as on-field reports.\nCover athlete.\n2008 NL Cy Young Award winner Tim Lincecum of the San Francisco Giants is the cover athlete for \"2K9\", replacing José Reyes.\nDevelopment.\nThen-lead developer Ben Brinkman's 1UP.com log claimed that \"MLB 2K9\" represented the final act of a planned three year development cycle for 2K's baseball series for next gen systems. He restated the \"three year plan\" in a January 18, 2008 podcast with \"Official Xbox Magazine\". In both interviews, Brinkman stated that \"2K9\", the third game, would represent the final, most polished version of the next gen series. However, Brinkman walked away from the series after the release of \"MLB 2K8\", handing the reins back to Visual Concepts.\nThe game received a day one patch on March 3, 2009, to fix a compromised franchise mode and connectivity issues. A second patch has been released for the PS3 on April 1, 2009, and for PC and Xbox 360 on April 3, 2009. The patch has addressed many issues, but most notably the AI batting aggression and the ease of home runs in online mode and certain difficulties.\nReception.\nThe high expectations for \"MLB 2K9\" resulted in disappointment, as \"2K9\" actually received worse average reviews than its derided predecessor, \"2K8\". \"GameSpot\" complained, \"Either MLB 2K9 shipped in a half-finished state or the developers have never seen a baseball, much less thrown one around,\" citing bizarre gameplay and noting the game was \"crammed with bugs.\" \"1UP.com\" called it \"...a game that tries so hard to prove that the series is progressing, but ignores fixing the issues that have plagued it for years: poor defense, sloppy animations, and catering to the home run...\" \"IGN\" stated, \"\"Major League Baseball 2K9\" fixes some of the issues from the past and sets the groundwork for a great game, but there are far too many bugs to recommend.\" \"TeamXbox\" said that it had, \"Lots of great improvements to the game's core mechanics, but the bugs will drive you insane\". \"Official Xbox Magazine\" said that its \"laundry list of annoying little problems is too substantial.\" \"GamesRadar\" called the game a \"paradox\", calling it \"fun and accessible\", but \"suffers from too many gaffes that are impossible to ignore.\" \"Operation Sports\" noted that \"...most games play out like a high-pitch summer softball league game... one of those leagues where all the players have $500 NASA engineered bats.\" \"GameSpy\" stated that casual fans would be attracted to the game, while \"hardcore\" simmers would be turned off by it.\nIGN's review of the Wii version had some diametrically opposed criticism of \"2K9\", stating it was too easy to strike out hitters with too-precise pitching, as well as a \"laughable\" franchise mode that featured 1 year, $40 million salaries for players like Danys Báez and no online play despite promises for one after \"2K8\" was released.\nDS spin-off.\nAs with \"2K8\", a more \"baseball-lite\" version of \"MLB 2K9\" was released for the Nintendo DS called \"Major League Baseball 2K9 Fantasy All-Stars\", which features fantasy elements such as power-ups and fantasy stadiums. The game retains similar gameplay to its predecessor.\nReception.\n\"IGN\" gave \"Major League Baseball 2K9 Fantasy All-Stars\" a 6.2 out of 10, deeming it a significant step up from its predecessor and citing the improvements made to pitching and touch controls as positives. \"IGN\" also criticized the stadium gimmicks, pacing, and the lack of an in-depth season or franchise mode.\nSoundtrack.\nThe following songs appear in the soundtrack:"

During his time at Nebraska, Nicks was known for his problems on and off the field, but in 2010, Nicks returned to Lincoln to apologize to head coach Bo Pelini for his behavior during his time at Nebraska.\nProfessional career.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nIn his rookie season, he replaced Jamar Nesbit in the starting lineup after Nesbit violated the league substance abuse policy. His play exceeded expectations and Nicks finished his rookie year playing in all 16 games and starting 13. After starting all 16 games in 2009 and the Saints three post-season games, he went into the 2010 season as the starting left guard. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2010 and 2011 and was a first-team All-Pro selection in 2011.\nNicks gave a profanity-laced radio interview after the Saints win in Super Bowl XLIV in which he excitedly shouted \"I'm going to mother-fucking Disneyland!\" as the Saints left the field after winning the game.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nNicks signed a five-year, $47.5 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 14, 2012. On October 30, 2012, Nicks was placed on injured reserve with a toe problem requiring surgery. He had not missed a game since joining the NFL.\nBefore the season began in 2013, Nicks and kicker Lawrence Tynes were diagnosed with methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\", causing him to miss week one of the season.\nOn July 25, 2014, the Buccaneers and Nicks mutually agreed to part ways, ending his tenure with the team. After signing as an unrestricted free agent during the 2012 offseason, Nicks played in nine games for the Buccaneers over the past two seasons.\nHealth issues, including a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection, forced his early retirement. He was inducted into the New Orleans Saints Hall of Fame on October 29, 2017."

        "title": "Darrell Scott (American football)",
        "text": "Darrell Scott (born April 16, 1989) is a former American football running back. He attended the University of South Florida, where he redshirted the 2010 college football season after having transferred from the University of Colorado. Scott attended St. Bonaventure High School in Ventura, California. Scott was considered the #1 running back of the 2008 high school class by \"Rivals.com\" and has drawn comparisons to LaDainian Tomlinson.\nHigh school career.\nScott was born in Tallahassee, Florida and spent parts of his childhood in Texas, before his family eventually moved to California. He enrolled at public Moorpark High School, where he had an outstanding football career, helping his team to reach the section championship game consecutive years in 2005 and 2006. In his junior year, Scott rushed for 3,194 yards on 337 carries. He also scored 45 touchdowns.\nIn order to face tougher competition in his senior year, Scott sought to transfer to a private school. His mother and stepfather reportedly “shopped their kid around”, inquiring several Los Angeles area high schools with elite football programs—among them Hart and Oaks Christian—about an enrollment, which caused some friction among Ventura County coaches. Scott eventually ended up at St. Bonaventure High School, where he rushed for 2,433 yards and 34 touchdowns. He helped St. Bonaventure complete a 14–1 season by winning the CIF Southern Section Northern Division title and capturing the Division III state championship. Following his high school career, Scott played in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nRecruiting.\nScott received scholarship offers by more than 40 schools, and eventually narrowed his choices to Colorado, Texas, Florida, and Louisiana State. Colorado was widely believed to be the frontrunner, since his uncle, Josh Smith, was playing wide receiver for the Colorado Buffaloes before deciding to leave the program. However, with Jamaal Charles leaving for the 2008 NFL Draft, Scott instantly increased his interest in the Texas Longhorns. Scott then gave Texas a private commitment, which changed after Texas running backs coach, Ken Rucker, became the team’s director of high school relations and player development. Scott announced his decision to attend Colorado during a news conference at the \"ESPN Zone\" in Anaheim on National Signing Day. His decision was carried live on \"ESPNU\". Scott was the highest rated football recruit to attend Colorado since Marcus Houston of Thomas Jefferson High School in Denver came to Boulder as part of the 2000 class.\nCollege career.\nScott played at tailback for the 2008 Colorado Buffaloes as a true freshman. \"Phil Steele's College Football\", based on his prep accomplishments, selected him to its preseason second-team All-Big 12 squad, while the \"Sporting News\" selected him as the Big 12’s top impact freshman and \"Lindy’s Big 12 Football\" tabbed him as the Offensive Newcomer of the Year in the conference.\nIn his first game for the Buffaloes, Scott rushed for 54 yards on 11 carries and scored his first career touchdown on a 1-yard jump with 2:14 left in the game. He finished his freshman season with 343 rushing yards off of 87 carries.\nAfter drawing only one running play in Colorado's 2009 season opening loss to Colorado State, Scott told \"The Denver Post\" that he wanted more carries.\nOn November 3, 2009, Scott announced his intention to transfer to UCLA, because of his lack of playing time at Colorado. His uncle Josh Smith left Colorado for UCLA before the summer of 2009. Further, the \"Los Angeles Times\" cited unnamed sources within the Bruins’ program that UCLA was not interested in landing Scott, since they already had five tailbacks, and a commitment from former four-star recruit Malcolm Jones.\nScott paid an official visit to the University of Cincinnati on March 11–12, 2010. He was also believed to have spoken to Georgia Tech, Houston, Tulsa and Wyoming about potentially playing for their programs.\nOn June 22, 2010, he decided to transfer to the University of South Florida, where he had two years of eligibility remaining after sitting out the 2010 season as a transfer. In his only on-field season at South Florida, Scott appeared in 11 games and started in 8, carrying the ball 153 times for 815 yards and 6 touchdowns (a 5.3 yard-per-carry average), with another 15 catches for 169 yards and one additional touchdown. In the best game of his career, Scott rushed for 164 yards and three touchdowns against Florida A&amp;M, where he also caught his sole receiving touchdown. Though Darrell battled injury that constantly kept him off of the field, his performance named him as a 2nd-team All-Big East running back.\nProfessional career.\n2012 NFL Draft.\nScott decided to forgo his final year of eligibility and entered the 2012 NFL Draft. He was projected to go undrafted by \"Sports Illustrated\", which he ultimately did. He was signed immediately after the draft by the Dallas Cowboys. Scott was cut after the 2012 season without having played a down."

        "title": "Glasgow Rowing Club",
        "text": "Glasgow Rowing Club is a rowing club, based in the Gorbals area of Glasgow, Scotland. It is a private club, with no direct public funding. Application for membership is open to all. The club is affiliated to Scottish Rowing. \nHistory.\nThe club was formed on 4 December 1983 by the amalgamation of Glasgow Argonauts Boat Club (GABC), founded in 1924 and City of Glasgow Amateur Rowing Club (CGARC), founded in 1965. GABC was originally a club for the Alumni of Glasgow University Boat Club, and CGARC was formerly The Printers Rowing Club founded early 1900s.\nBoth clubs had for some years resided as tenants of other clubs and part of the reason for the merger was the shared desire to build new premises. The boathouse, which was officially opened by the Lord Provost of Glasgow in May 1997, is located in Silverfir Place on the south bank of the River Clyde, just along from Shawfield Stadium.\nThe club colours are yellow and red. These were chosen to reflect the club's origins and were the minor colours of the predecessor clubs: GABC colours were pale blue, black and gold (not yellow) and CGARC were dark blue and red. The oar design has changed from the original yellow with red collar and red tip, through the design displayed, to the current design.\nMajor successes.\nIn the 2004 UK National Rowing Championships in Nottingham member Lindsay Dick won the women's single sculls event, while her fellow member and partner Alastair Warnock won the equivalent men's event. Warnock also made good progress in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta that year, with one particularly noteworthy scalp in the first round, only to be beaten in the semi-final by the eventual winner of the event.\nLindsay Dick won a Bronze medal at the 2006 World Rowing Championships at Dorney Lake in the Women's Lightweight Quadruple Sculls.\nAt Henley Royal Regatta in 2009 the club set a precedent for Scottish rowing clubs by having crews race in quarter-finals of two different events (the Britannia Challenge Cup and the Wyfold Challenge Cup), although neither crew progressed to the semi-final stage. Previous Henley participation has included Fran Jacob racing in the Princess Royal Challenge Cup in 2008 and Alastair Warnock who reached the semi-final stage of the Diamond Challenge Sculls in successive years; in 2004 and 2005.\nLater in 2009, at the National Rowing Championships, Glasgow crews won Men's Lightweight Fours (C. Logan, K. Docherty, J. Logan and S. Scrimgeour) and Men's Lightweight Pairs (C. Logan and J. Logan). Glasgow also had a share in the composite crew that won the Silver medal in Women's eights.\nIn March 2010, Glasgow members provided the core of a composite crew, along with rowers from Glasgow and Strathclyde Universities, that won the Novice Academic category at the Women's Eights Head of the River Race (WEHoRR)."

        "text": "Tony Dixon (born June 18, 1979) is a former American football safety in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Alabama.\nEarly years.\nDixon attended Pickens County High School, where he was a two-way football player (running back and defensive back). He was a four-year starter and earned All-State honors two years in a row. \nAs a junior he registered 1,286 rushing yards, 17 touchdowns, 115 tackles and 6 interceptions (3 returned for touchdowns). As a senior, he posted 1,450 rushing yards, 18 rushing touchdowns, 2 touchdown passes, one receiving touchdown, 6 sacks, 4 interceptions and 2 fumble recoveries.\nCollege career.\nDixon accepted a football scholarship from the University of Alabama. As a true freshman, he collected 22 tackles (2 for loss) and one sack, earning his first career start at free safety against the University of Tennessee. He had 6 tackles against Auburn University.\nAs a sophomore, he became a regular starter at strong safety, tallying 75 tackles (third on the team), 2 tackles for loss, one interception and one pass defensed. He had 11 tackles against Louisiana State University. He made 14 tackles against Mississippi State University.\nAs a junior, he split time between strong and free safety. He posted 65 tackles (second on the team), 2 tackles for loss, 4 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He had 13 tackles against the University of Florida.\nAs a senior, he started at free safety, finishing with 90 tackles (third on the team), one sack, 2 interceptions, 6 passes defensed and one forced fumble. He had 10 tackles, one interception and one pass defensed against the University of Mississippi. He made 17 tackles against the University of Tennessee. He made 11 tackles against Auburn University.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys (first stint).\nThe Dallas Cowboys traded down in the second round of the 2001 NFL Draft, sending to the Miami Dolphins the 52nd overall selection (Chris Chambers), in exchange for the 56th (used to select Dixon) and the 122nd (Markus Steele). As a rookie, he played on the nickel defense.\nIn his second season, he started the last six games at strong safety, after Darren Woodson suffered a season-ending groin injury, making 49 tackles, 2 sacks, 4 quarterback pressures, 2 passes defensed, one interception and 16 special teams (third on the team). \nIn 2003, he was a special teams standout, leading the team with 20 tackles.\nIn 2004, after Woodson missed the season due to a herniated disc, he split time with Lynn Scott at strong safety, registering seven starts and finding a niche as a blitzer, tying for fifth in the NFL among defensive backs with 3 sacks. He wasn't re-signed after the season and finished his Cowboys career with 90 tackles (56 solo), 6 sacks, 10 passes defensed, 49 special teams tackles and one interception.\nWashington Redskins.\nOn June 18, 2005, signed a one-year contract as a free agent with the Washington Redskins. He was released before the start of the season on August 23.\nDallas Cowboys (second stint).\nOn November 1, 2005, he was signed by the Dallas Cowboys to help improve the secondary depth. On November 9, he was cut to make room for linebacker Quinton Caver. He was brought back for depth purposes on December 26. He wasn't re-signed at the end of the season."

        "title": "1947 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1947 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game. It was the 33rd Rose Bowl Game. The Illinois Fighting Illini defeated the UCLA Bruins, 45–14. Illinois halfbacks Buddy Young and Jules Rykovich shared the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game award. They were named the Rose Bowl Players Of The Game when the award was created in 1953 and selections were made retroactively. It was the first Rose Bowl game that featured teams from the Pacific Coast Conference and the Big Nine Conference by the terms of an exclusive five-year agreement. It is known as the first \"modern\" Rose Bowl, and the modern Rose Bowl records date back to this game. This exclusive agreement remained in place until the 1999 Rose Bowl when the Rose Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series, with the exception of the games from 1960 onward following the collapse of the PCC and prior to the renegotiation with the newly formed Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU), highlighted by the 1962 Rose Bowl where Big Ten champion Ohio State declined the invitation.\nBig Nine-PCC agreement.\nAt the beginning, the Rose Bowl game was intended to match a West Coast team against the best of the nation. The first team to appear was Michigan in the 1902 Rose Bowl when they defeated Stanford 49-0. The Rose Bowl began to be hosted by the Pacific Coast Conference when it was revived in the 1916 Rose Bowl, and permanently with the 1920 Rose Bowl. Ohio State was the next Big Ten team to participate what they lost to California 0-28 in the 1921 Rose Bowl. The Big Ten did not participate in bowl games following that game. The University of Chicago discontinued its football program in 1939 and withdrew from the conference in 1946, leaving the Big Nine Conference.\nDuring World War II, many college football schools had dropped some conference opponents and instead played football against local military base teams. Many colleges could not even field teams due to the draft and manpower requirements. After the war was over, demobilization and the G.I. Bill enabled returning servicemen to attend college. The 1946 season was the first true post-war college football season with travel restrictions lifted and civilian college opponents returning to schedules.\nThe Big Nine agreed, after much negotiating over payments, rules, and ticket allocations to a five-year exclusive deal with the Rose Bowl to send the conference champion to meet the PCC conference champion. UCLA, USC, Minnesota and Illinois all voted against it. UCLA, the PCC conference champion, expressed interest in playing either Army or Notre Dame, who had played to a scoreless tie in the 1946 Army vs. Notre Dame football game.\nThe Big Nine and PCC were of the same accord when it came to treating players as amateurs, as compared to the semi-professional status that the Southern Universities proposed. Also, the Big Nine and PCC both had the same attitudes towards desegregation and allowing African-Americans to play football. Many other universities were still segregated. None of the Southeastern Conference schools had an African American athlete until 1966. The Cotton Bowl, Orange Bowl, and Sugar Bowl would not be integrated until 1948, 1955, and 1956 respectively.\nTeams.\nUCLA Bruins.\nThe UCLA Bruins had last appeared in the 1943 Rose Bowl where they were held scoreless against Georgia. The Bruins fielded the strongest team in their history to date. It was the second undefeated team since the 1939 6–0–4 team, and the first undefeated and untied team in school history. After convincing wins over Oregon State and at Washington, UCLA entered the AP Poll at number 5. The Bruins would go to number four after defeating number 17 Stanford, 26–6. Coming into the November 23, 1946 UCLA–USC rivalry football game, the Rose Bowl was on the line for both USC and UCLA. UCLA prevailed, 13–6, to win the PCC. In the Bruins' final game of the regular season, they blanked the Nebraska Cornhuskers, 18–0.\nThe 10-0 UCLA Bruins entered the Rose Bowl as the bookmakers' favorite, having outscored their opponents 313-72. All-conference quarterback Ernie Case called the plays for a prolific offense featuring pass-catching ends Burr Baldwin and future hall-of-famer Tom Fears, and bolstered by the breakout running of fullbacks Cal Rossi and Johnny Roesh and halfback Gene Rowland. Rossi weighed in as the Bruins' heaviest back at just 170 lb, but the team averaged a shade over 200 lb per man. Several linemen in the 230 lb range (as big as they came in the days of one-platoon football) made for an intimidating and forceful UCLA front which stampeded west coast rivals with apparent ease. Averaging just 190 lb the Illini were noticeably smaller.\nIllinois Fighting Illini.\nThis was the first appearance for the Fighting Illini in any post-season football game. The Illini opened the season winning at Pittsburgh, 33–7. They lost to Notre Dame in the first game for the 1946 Fighting Irish, a team that would eventually play in the 1946 Game of the Century against Army. The Illini beat Purdue, but then lost to Indiana. The Illini would go on to win the rest of their games including 13–9 at Michigan and a 16–7 win over Ohio State. In the final regular season game, they blanked in-state rival Northwestern 20–0. The win over Michigan proved to be the pivotal game as Michigan finished 5–1–1 in conference to Illinois 6–1 record.\nClaude \"Buddy\" Young was the University of Illinois’ first black football star. The 5’4\" speedster made an immediate impact as a freshman in 1944, scoring sixty-four and thirty yard touchdowns on his first two touches vs. Illinois State. A 93-yard run two games later against the Great Lakes Naval Training School remains the longest run from scrimmage in Illini history. Young finished the season with thirteen touchdowns, breaking Red Grange's 1924 Big Ten Conference record and landing the freshman on several all-America lists. More impressively, Young claimed NCAA track championships in the 100 and 220-yard dash, and tied world records in the 45 and 60-yard dash. After being drafted into the navy in January 1945 he starred the following fall for the Fleet City California Naval Base football team, almost single-handedly winning the west coast service team championship with three touchdowns, including two kick returns of 93 and 88 yards in front of 65,000 fans at the L.A. Coliseum. In 1946 Young returned to Champaign and led the Illini with 456 rushing yards a little over four yards per carry despite persistent injury problems.\nYoung shared the backfield with fellow halfback Art Dufelmeier, known fondly as the \"Flying Dutchman\". The Havana, Ill. native enrolled in Champaign in 1942 and lettered in both football and basketball as a freshman. He enlisted with the U.S. Air Force in 1943 and entered one of the most dangerous service jobs as a B-42 top-gunner. In early 1944 Dufelmeier's plane was shot down over France. He spent eleven months as a POW inside Germany, losing 35 lb before liberation. Simply glad to be alive, Dufelmeier relished his return to football in 1946.\nDespite Young and Dufelmeier rushing for over 900 combined yards, Illinois’ only all-conference and all-America selection was right guard Alex Agase. Another tough veteran, Agase had served as a marine in the Pacific. He participated in the amphibious invasions of both Okinawa and Iwo Jima, earning a Purple Heart. Alex's brother Lou played at left tackle. Alex Agase had scored twice as a sophomore against Minnesota in 1942, making him only the second guard to notch a multiple touchdown performance in collegiate history. The following year, he made all-America lists playing for Purdue while training as a Marine in Indiana. Later Agase would coach Northwestern and Purdue. His obvious football intelligence contributed inestimably to the top-notch run-blocking of Illinois' line.\nGame summary.\nThe UCLA Bruins scored their first ever post-season points when Ernie Case scored on a quarterback sneak to give the Bruins a 7–6 first-quarter lead. However, it was the fourth-ranked Illini who took control after that, outscoring UCLA 39–7. Illinois dominated the Bruins on the ground, compiling 320 yards to the Bruins 62.\nRegardless of any apparent size mis-match, history repeated itself as Illinois out-witted and out-played the bigger Bruins in the same convincing style in which Alabama had blow past the larger Trojans a year earlier. The Agase brothers and Illini captain center Mack Wenskunas opened gaping holes all day, often simply cutting the Bruins down at the knees for Young, Dufelmeier, and Co. to skip over and around. UCLA coach Bert Labrucherie used virtually every player on his three-deep trying to counter Illinois’ unstoppable blocking. But to no avail. The \"New York Times\" post-game report claimed that the affair \"looked like a college line blocking against high school forwards.\"\nThe Illini marched sixty yards on their first possession for a score. The rout began with quarterback Perry Moss tossing a 44-yard completion to halfback Julius Rykovich. After a kickoff return set UCLA up at midfield Case responded in kind with a 40-yard strike to his diminutive but elusive halfback Al Hoisch. When the Bruins scored to take an early 7-6 lead the 90,000-strong crowd sensed an epic in the making. Instead they witnessed Illinois shifting gears and leaving UCLA behind.\nIllinois put together scoring drives of sixty and fifty-five yards on its first two possessions of the second quarter. A lineup of mostly second-string players added a fourth Illini score shortly before the break. Hoisch responded with a scintillating 103-kickoff return [still a Rose Bowl record] to keep the score respectable at the interval. But solo efforts, no matter how impressive, could not make up the difference. Young finished another long drive, this time fifty-one yards, with a short scoring run on the first play of the fourth quarter. Russell Steger then ran back a Case interception for a 65-yard defensive touchdown to make the score 38-14. Stanley Green, a fourth-string Illinois back, added insult to injury with a second six-point interception return in the game's final minutes.\nThe Illini prevailed in an outright romp, 45-14. Eliot's squad held the Bruins to just twelve first downs and forced six demoralizing turnovers. Most incredibly, the Illini held a team that had run roughshod over the west coast to a paltry sixty-two rushing yards. Only 176 passing yards on 29 attempts from Case afforded any offensive success. Despite their lesser physical stature Illinois racked up 320 team rushing yards, including 100-yard performances from both Young and Dufelmeier.\nThe 1946 season marked the first visit to Pasadena from the Big Ten champion since Ohio State fell 28-0 to Cal in 1921. The Big Ten would provide the visitor at the New Year's Day classic for each of the next fifty-one seasons.\nA number of records were set in the game. Illinois set two new Rose bowl records: Most first downs at 28 (the previous first down record was 22, set against UCLA by Georgia in the 1943 Rose Bowl), and Most yards gained by rushing at 320 (the previous record for yards rushing was Oregon's 298 against Harvard in the 1920 Rose Bowl. Six different Illinois players scored touchdowns. These were broken in later years.\nUCLA's Al Hoisch returned Illinois kicker Don Maechtle's kickoff 103 yards, establishing a Rose Bowl and UCLA team record which still stands as of the 2008 Rose Bowl. Hoisch also still holds the modern Rose Bowl record for Highest average Gain Per Return at 44.5 yards. The eight kickoff returns made by the Bruins also are a Rose Bowl record.\nIllinois' Russell Steger set modern Rose Bowl records for both most yards on interception returns and the longest interception return for a touchdown with a 68-yard return that scored in the fourth quarter. Elmer Layden holds the records, set in the 1925 Rose Bowl.\nAftermath.\nSix modern Rose Bowl records still stand as of the 2008 Rose Bowl. Buddy Young and Julius Rykovich were named co-Most valuable players when the Rose Bowl introduced the award in 1953 and then retroactively applied the award to previous games. They were inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall Of Fame in 1993. Al Hoisch was inducted in 1999.\nThe Big Ten dominated early in the Rose Bowl Series, winning 12 of the first 13. The tide would begin turn to the West coast teams with the 1960 Rose Bowl.\nUCLA and Illinois would have a re-match in the 1984 Rose Bowl with UCLA winning 45–9 in a reverse of the 1947 game, where Illinois was favored and wanted a better opponent.\nThe exclusive agreement remained in place until the 1999 Rose Bowl when the Rose Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series. The Pacific-10 Conference inherited the PCC representative position for the game. Even after 1998, the Rose Bowl would still attempt to pair a Big Ten and Pac-10 team. The 2008 Rose Bowl would feature USC vs. Illinois."

        "text": "Víctor Manuel Cruz Gil (December 24, 1957 – September 26, 2004) was a Major League Baseball pitcher. He played during five seasons at the major league level for the Toronto Blue Jays, Cleveland Indians, Pittsburgh Pirates, and Texas Rangers.\nCruz represented the Dominican Republic at the 1975 Pan American Games, and afterward was signed by the St. Louis Cardinals as an amateur free agent in 1976. Cruz played his first professional season with their rookie league Johnson City Cardinals, then split 1977 with the Arkansas Travelers and St. Petersburg Cardinals. After the 1977 season, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays with Tom Underwood for John Scott and Pete Vuckovich. Cruz spent the first half of 1978 with the Triple-A Syracuse Chiefs, where he had a 3–2 win–loss record and a 4.50 earned run average (ERA) in 25 games. He made his major league debut on June 24, and spent the rest of the season with the Blue Jays, finishing the year with a 7–3 record and a 1.71 ERA in 32 games. After the season ended, Cruz was traded to the Cleveland Indians for Phil Lansford and Alfredo Griffin.\nUpon joining the Indians, Cruz modified his pitching style closer to that of Luis Tiant; the media had noted at the time that the two also had identical mustaches. Cruz spent the full season with the Indians, finishing the year with a 3–9 record and a 4.23 ERA in 61 games. He followed that up with a 6–7 record and a 3.55 ERA in 55 games in 1980. After the 1980 season, Gary Alexander, Bob Owchinko, Rafael Vasquez and Cruz were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates for Manny Sanguillen and Bert Blyleven. Cruz began the season in the minor leagues, but was brought up to the Pirates' main roster, where he had a 1–1 record and a 2.65 ERA in 22 games.\nAfter the 1981 season, Cruz was traded to the Texas Rangers for Nelson Norman. Cruz spent 1982 with the Denver Bears and 1983 with the Oklahoma City 89ers. After a 2.16 ERA in 30 games for Oklahoma City, he was promoted to the Rangers' major league squad, as the Rangers felt that he had both his pitching and weight under control, he had lost 39 pounds during the previous offseason. In his final major league season, Cruz had a 1–3 record with a 1.44 ERA in 17 games. His final two professional baseball seasons were spent with the Oklahoma City 89ers in 1984, and the Detroit Tigers' Triple-A Nashville Sounds in 1985.\nCruz died from liver problems in his native Dominican Republic on September 26, 2004, at the age of 46."

        "text": "The Confederate Monument of Bowling Green, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is among the sixty-one monuments of the Civil War Monuments of Kentucky Multiple Property Submission, all of which became part of the National Register of Historic Places on July 17, 1997. It is within Bowling Green's Fairview Cemetery, on the east side of the old/northern side of the cemetery.\nDescription.\nThe monument is made of white limestone that was locally acquired. It cost $1,500 to build, attained by a subscription drive that ran from 1875 until the monument's dedication on May 3, 1876. The obelisk stands thirty feet tall, and is draped by a carved Confederate flag. A bas-relief of a painting popular in the Reconstruction-South, Henry Mosler's \"Lost Cause\", which typified the devastation of the U.S. Civil War between the Union army and the Confederate army, was placed on the front of the monument. Different reliefs are on other sides of the monument.\nThe carving that depicts Mosler's painting is signed \"SMITH &amp; BROEG,\" which appears in the plaque's lower right corner (not visible in the gallery image). The stonemason Hugh F. Smith (1825–1897), based in Bowling Green, also had a partial interest in the White Stone Quarry from which the stone was mined. Other grave markers located in Fairview Cemetery and signed by Smith include stones for the Spindler family, John Hess, and C.P. Snell.\nStatues of cannons pointed straight up are twenty feet away from each corner of the main monuments, and are eight feet tall. Cannonballs are depicted around the base of the cannon monuments.\nA marker describing the monument lies in front of the monument, beside the cemetery road. The marker contains a factual error, saying that Thomas Hines was unable to make it to the dedication due to dying before then. In actuality, Hines would not die for another twenty-two years; his grave is in the same cemetery. Another problem with the marker is that it gives Henry Mosler's name as Thomas Moseler.\nSurrounding the monument are the graves of seventy Confederate soldiers, some of them unidentified.\nHistory.\nIt was built thanks to the efforts of George B. Payne. In 1875, he lived in Topeka, Kansas, but had served in the Confederate 4th Kentucky Infantry during the Civil War, spending much time around Bowling Green as he was a courier under General John C. Breckinridge. He desired a monument honoring the Confederate war dead buried at the cemetery. This caused the Warren County Monumental Association to form, with Thomas Hines, who had served as a spy under John Hunt Morgan but was now living in Bowling Green, serving as president. Popular support for the monument came from the barbaric actions of Union general Stephen Burbridge, who sought to murder Confederate soldiers for any reason, resulting in the deaths of twenty-two residents of Warren County in 1864. Prior to that time, the Union saw more support in the county, though the Confederate government of Kentucky briefly resided in Bowling Green 1861–1862.\nOver ten thousand people came to the dedication of the monument. The dedication speaker was William Campbell Preston Breckinridge, who served as a colonel for John Hunt Morgan's 9th Kentucky Cavalry, and was instrumental in many veteran organizations for former Confederate soldiers.\nOne other Civil War monument is at Fairview Cemetery, the William F. Perry Monument."

This allowed several foreign-born players, including Spanish-born Borja Vidal, Goran Stojanović and Jovo Damjanović from Montenegro, and Bertrand Roiné who previously played for France, to play for the Qatar team at the championship.\nHead of the Qatar Handball Federation, Ahmed Mohammed Abdulrab Al Shaabi, acknowledged the policy in a statement in June 2013, saying \"We're a small nation with limited human resources, so we had to bring players from outside in the past.\" He also announced an end to the policy at the time, adding however that they \"[might] make an exception only in the case of an experienced goalkeeper.\" In January 2014, Danish sports agent Mads Winther said he had met with \"contacts involved with Qatar\" regarding the possibility of naturalising Danish players.\nThe practice was criticised by Austrian goalkeeper Thomas Bauer after his team's loss to Qatar in the quarter-final, saying \"It [felt] like playing against a world selection team\" and \"I think it is not the sense of a world championship.\" At a press conference during the championship, Qatar head coach Valero Rivera declined to comment on the matter. Spanish player Joan Cañellas did not think it was an issue, saying \"If they can do it, why not.\"\nAfter the controversial semi-final against Poland, and reaching the final as a result, the practice was even more criticised, with players such as Danijel Šarić having now represented four different national teams.\nPaid fans.\nQatar flew in about 60 Spanish fans to cheer for Qatar during the 2015 World Championship.\nRefereeing favouritism.\nThe referees were widely accused of being one-sided in favour of Qatar during its biggest success, 2nd place in the 2015 World Championship. Especially at the last-16 encounter against Austria, the quarterfinal against Germany and the semi-final against Poland. After the final whistle, the Polish players showed their disgust by sarcastically applauding the three referees."

        "text": "The 2008 Vuelta a España was the 63rd edition of the Vuelta a España, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race began with a team time trial on 30 August in Granada. The Vuelta came to a close twenty-three days later with a flat stage, which brought the peloton into the streets of Madrid. Nineteen teams entered the race, which was won by the Spaniard Alberto Contador of . Second and third respectively were the American Levi Leipheimer of and the Spanish Carlos Sastre of .\nAlberto Contador first gained the race lead after the race's thirteenth stage, which contained a summit finish on the Alto de El Angliru. Contador took the lead from 's Egoi Martínez, who had held the race lead for four stages. Through the first nine days of racing the race leader's golden jersey had been worn by eight different riders. The day after Contador gained the lead of the race, he attacked again and won the stage, while also expanding his lead over his competitors. Contador lost about thirty seconds to his teammate Levi Leipheimer in the stage 20 individual time trial, but together he and Levi further distanced themselves from the other general classification contenders.\nContador's win at the Vuelta allowed him to become the first Spaniard – and the fifth person in the history of cycling – to win all three Grand Tours in a career. At the age of 25, Contador became the youngest person to ever win all three Grand Tours. Contador was also the third cyclist to ever win the Giro d'Italia and the Vuelta in the same calendar year. In addition to the general classification, Contador also won the combination classification. In the race's other classifications, 's Greg Van Avermaet won the points classification and David Moncoutié of the team won the mountains classification. Finally, won the team classification, which ranked each of the nineteen teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nTeams.\nA total of 19 teams were invited to participate in the 2008 Vuelta a España. Sixteen of the competing squads were UCI ProTour teams, while the other three teams were UCI Professional Continental teams. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, so the Vuelta began with a peloton of 171 cyclists. Out of the 171 riders that started this edition of the Vuelta, a total of 131 riders made it to the finish in Madrid. chose not participate in the race, as they withdrew their application to compete in the Vuelta in order to race the Tours of Ireland, Britain, and Missouri. While – formerly known as Saunier Duval–Scott – was excluded from the event as a result of the doping cases of Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli in the 2008 Tour de France.\nThe 19 teams invited to the race were:\n†: Invited Pro-continental teams\nRoutes and Stages.\nThis edition of the Vuelta contained three time trial events, two of which were individual and one a team event. Six stages were classified as mountain stages, while two stages were deemed intermediate stages. Ten of the stages were designated as flat stages, which meant that they were primarily flat but could contain a climb or two of a lesser category.\nRace overview.\n\"For details, see 2008 Vuelta a España, Stage 1 to Stage 11 and 2008 Vuelta a España, Stage 12 to Stage 21.\"\nThe 2008 Vuelta a España began with a short team time trial in Granada, a traditional city in the history of the Vuelta, having hosted a stage start or finish 39 previous times. Though Astana and Team CSC Saxo Bank were thought to be favorites to win this stage, the top team was Liquigas, which put their team leader Filippo Pozzato in the first golden jersey. This set the stage for an extremely turbulent first week in terms of race leadership, as Alejandro Valverde, Daniele Bennati, Levi Leipheimer, Sylvain Chavanel, and Alessandro Ballan would all don the \"maillot oro\" between the race's beginning and Stage 7. All but Chavanel did this by virtue of stage wins – Chavanel, for his part, had been 2 seconds behind Leipheimer for the race lead after the Vuelta's first individual time trial (ITT), and took it the next day thanks to time bonuses in intermediate sprints.\nAfter the first rest day came the Vuelta's longest stage, said to be the queen stage, as it had many high mountain climbs and an extremely difficult climb to the finish in Andorra. As it happened, the day the stage was run was marked by consistent rain and cold temperatures, making the stage harder still. Ballan won this stage from a breakaway and took the overall lead, but he was unable to remain in contention the next day. Leipheimer, who had been in second overall, re-assumed the overall lead. In Stage 9, Leipheimer's Astana team afforded a breakaway including Egoi Martínez sufficient time that Martínez took the overall lead, meaning that through nine stages the race lead had only been retained from one day to the next one time.\nThe next several stages were flat, and won by sprinters and breakaways, meaning Martínez was able to retain the overall lead for a time. Stage 13, which ended at the storied Alto de El Angliru, revealed the race's overall contenders. Alberto Contador won the stage and in so doing gained a lead over Leipheimer, Carlos Sastre, Ezequiel Mosquera, and Valverde which he would never relinquish. Contador padded this lead by winning the stage the next day, and kept it in the race's second and final ITT, where his strongest challenger was ironically his teammate Leipheimer.\nThe points classification was won by Belgian rider Greg Van Avermaet, who had won Stage 9 and finished in the top ten of nine other stages. The King of the Mountains went to ' David Moncoutié, also a stage winner. The summit stage finish won by Moncoutié as well as points gained by topping climbs at the head of the peloton in the Angliru stage proved to propel Moncoutié into the granate jersey. The combination classification, an award unique to the Vuelta among the Grand Tours, was won by Contador, as his first in the General Classification, second in the points classification, and third in the King of the Mountains Classification was by far the strongest combined showing by any rider. With the overall victory, Contador became the first Spaniard and fifth rider ever to complete the career sweep of the Grand Tours.\nClassification Leadership.\nIn the 2008 Vuelta a España, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding the finishing times of the stages per cyclist, the leader received a golden jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the Vuelta a España, and the winner of the general classification is considered the winner of the Vuelta.\nAdditionally, there was also a points classification, which awarded a blue jersey. In the points classification, cyclists received points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. The winner got 25 points, second place 20, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point per place less down the line, to a single point for fifteenth. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, which awarded a granate jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a mountain before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized, with most of the climbs being either first, second, third, or fourth category. There were also two \"special category\" climbs (equivalent to hors catégorie in the Tour de France), the stage finishes into Andorra and the Alto de El Angliru. \"Special category\" climbs paid 30 points for the first rider over the summit, then 25, 20, 16, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1. First category climbs paid 16 points for the leader, then 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2 and 1, second category climbs 10, 7, 5, 3, 2 and 1, and third category climbs 6, 4, 2 and 1.\nFinally, there was the combination classification. This was calculated by adding the rankings in the general, points and mountains classifications; the cyclist with the lowest combined ranking was the leader in the combination classification, and received a white jersey.\nThere was also a classification for teams. In this classification, the times of the best three cyclists per stage were added, and the team with the lowest time was leader.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run.\nIf a cyclist leads two or more competitions at the end of a stage, he receives all those jerseys. In the next stage, he can only wear one jersey, and he wears the jersey representing leadership in the most important competition (golden first, then blue, then granate, then white). The other jerseys that the cyclists owns are worn in the next stage by the second-place (or, if needed, third or fourth-place) rider in that classification."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues; it selected no one. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 31, 1988, with Commissioner of Baseball Peter Ueberroth in attendance.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1968 or later, but not after 1982; the ballot included candidates from the 1987 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1982. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 44 players; a total of 427 ballots were cast, with 321 votes required for election. A total of 2,819 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.60 per ballot. Those candidates receiving less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been elected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The 20 candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nRoger Maris, Elston Howard and Don Larsen were on the ballot for the 15th and final time.\nThe newly-eligible players included 21 All-Stars, two of whom were not included on the ballot, representing a total of 44 All-Star selections. Among the new candidates were 7-time All-Stars Willie Stargell and Reggie Smith, who were the only candidates to have been selected at least five times. The field included one MVP (Stargell), two Cy Young Award-winners (Randy Jones and Sparky Lyle) and one Rookie of the Year (Stan Bahnsen).\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: John D'Acquisto, Barry Foote, Tom Griffin, Mick Kelleher, Len Randle, Ken Reitz, Dave Roberts, Eddie Solomon, Don Stanhouse, Fred Stanley, and Frank Taveras.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nJim Murray (1919–1998) received the J. G. Taylor Spink Award honoring a baseball writer. The award was voted at the December 1987 meeting of the BBWAA, and included in the summer 1988 ceremonies."

Since the tournament's 2021 revival and adoption of the single-site format, the championship is also determined by a single game. In 2023, the CBI introduced NIL funding of $40,000 to be distributed in the following manner: $25,000 to the champion, $10,000 to the runner-up, and $2,500 to each semifinalist.\nThe inaugural CBI.\nThe 2008 College Basketball Invitational was the first new postseason tournament since the Collegiate Commissioners Association Tournament in 1974.

A year later, he was drafted by the New York Yankees in the first round (seventh overall) of the secondary phase of the 1980 Major League Baseball draft.\nDodd was an outfielder when he joined the Fort Lauderdale Yankees in , though he played some first base and catcher during his minor league career as well. In , Dodd hit 29 home runs and had 95 runs batted in as a member of the Greensboro Hornets.\nMcGriff deal.\nEarly in the season, he, fellow Yankees farmhand Jeff Reynolds and first baseman Dave Revering were traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for John Mayberry. After the season, the Yankees reacquired Dodd and relief pitcher Dale Murray for Fred McGriff, Dave Collins and Mike Morgan. Third baseman Graig Nettles was also supposed to be included in the deal, but when the Jays refused to give him a hefty bonus, the Yankees included cash in the deal to compensate.\nMLB debut.\nThe Yankees released Dodd the following May. Shortly afterwards, he signed with the Chicago White Sox, with whom he remained through the season. The ChiSox released him just before the start of the minor league season. He signed with the Baltimore Orioles, and batted .300 for the first time in his career for the Orioles' Southern League and Carolina League affiliates.\nDodd's best season was , when he batted .306 with thirty home runs for the Charlotte O's and Rochester Red Wings. Along the way, he earned a promotion to the big league club. He made his major league debut on July 25, drawing a walk in his only at-bat.\nHe entered seven games as a pinch hitter, remaining in one at third base, despite the fact that he had made very few appearances as a third baseman in his minor league career. He hit his only major league home run in his only major league start on August 1 when manager Earl Weaver used Dodd as his designated hitter against the Toronto Blue Jays.\nDespite hitting a career high and team-record 37 home runs for the Charlotte O's in , Dodd never returned to the majors.

The competition was organized by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body, and was held in Argentina from 1 to 24 July. The draw for the tournament was held in La Plata on 11 November 2010.\nUruguay won the tournament after defeating Paraguay 3–0 in the final, giving them a record 15th Copa América title and their first since 1995. Paraguay, as the tournament runner-up, earned the Copa Bolivia; Paraguay's performance was noteworthy, as they were able to reach the finals without winning a single game in the tournament; their success in the final stages was achieved by the way of penalty shoot-outs. Brazil were the defending champions but were eliminated by Paraguay in the quarter-finals after failing to convert any of the penalties. As the tournament champion, Uruguay earned the right to represent CONMEBOL in the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, held in Brazil. Despite losing to Peru 4–1 in the third-place match, Venezuela had their best ever performance in the tournament.\nCompeting nations.\nBoth Japan and Mexico were invited to join the CONMEBOL nations in the tournament. Following a proposal by UEFA regarding national teams competing in tournaments organised by confederations different from their own, it was reported on 23 November 2009 that the two countries might not be able to take part in the 2011 Copa América. However, on 31 March 2010, CONCACAF confirmed that Mexico would be allowed to send their 2012 U-23 Olympic Team, supplemented with five over-age players. In addition to Mexico sending a weaker team than those teams sent in previous participations, eight of the Mexican players originally called to play the Copa America 2011 were suspended because of indiscipline one week before the competition started.\nJapan's participation was in doubt after the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, but the Japan Football Association confirmed on 16 March 2011 that they would participate. However, the Japanese FA later withdrew from the tournament on 4 April 2011 citing scheduling conflict with rescheduled J. League matches. Following a meeting with the leadership of the Argentine Football Association, the Japanese FA decided to hold off on their final decision until 15 April. The Japanese FA later announced on 14 April that they would compete in the competition using mainly European based players. The Japanese FA withdrew their team again on 16 May citing difficulties with European clubs in releasing Japanese players. On the next day, CONMEBOL sent a formal invitation letter to the Costa Rican Football Federation inviting Costa Rica as replacement. Costa Rica accepted the invitation later that day.\nThe following twelve teams, shown with pre-tournament FIFA World Rankings, played in the tournament:\nVenues.\nA total of eight cities hosted the tournament. The opening game was played at Estadio Ciudad de La Plata, and the final was played at Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti.\nDraw.\nThe draw for the competition took place on 11 November 2010 at 17:00 () in the Teatro Argentino de La Plata in La Plata, and was broadcast in Argentina by Canal Siete. On 18 October 2010, CONMEBOL's The executive committee decided to place the teams in pots for the draw.\nSquads.\nEach association presented a list of twenty-three players to compete in the tournament five days before their first match. On 14 June 2011, CONMEBOL allowed for the inscription of twenty-three players for the tournament, up one player from the previous allowed twenty-two. Of those twenty-three players, three must be goalkeepers.\nMatch officials.\nThe list of twenty-four referees and two extra referees selected for the tournament were announced on 6 June 2011 by CONMEBOL's Referee Commission. Two referees were chosen from each participating association:\n Sergio Pezzotta\n Raúl Orosco\n Sálvio Fagundes\n Enrique Osses\n Wilmar Roldán\n Carlos Vera\n Carlos Amarilla\n Víctor Hugo Rivera\n Roberto Silvera\n Juan Soto\n Wálter Quesada\n Francisco Chacón\nExtra assistants: Diego Bonfa, Hernán Maidana\nGroup stage.\nThe first round, or group stage, saw the twelve teams divided into three groups of four teams. Each group was a round-robin of three games, where each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same group. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and none for a defeat. The teams finishing first and second in each group, and the two best-placed third teams, qualified for the quarter-finals.\nTeams were ranked on the following criteria:\n\"All times are in local, Argentina Time ().\"\nRanking of third-placed teams.\nAt the end of the first stage, a comparison was made between the third-placed teams of each group. The two best third-placed teams advanced to the quarter-finals.\nKnockout stage.\nDifferent from previous tournaments, in the knockout stage, 30 minutes of extra time were played if any match finished tied after regulation (previously the match would go straight to a penalty shoot-out). This was the first time in the history of the tournament where the knockout stage did not include any invited teams, as both Mexico and Costa Rica were eliminated during the group stage. Paraguay reached the final despite not having won a single match in the competition.\nGoalscorers.\nWith five goals, Paolo Guerrero of Peru was the top scorer in the tournament. In total, 54 goals were scored by 39 different players, with only one of them credited as an own goal.\nMarketing.\nSponsorship.\nGlobal Platinum Sponsor:\nGlobal Gold Sponsor:\nGlobal Silver Sponsor:\nOfficial Supplier:\nCharitable Partner:\nLocal Supplier:\nWeb Hosting:\nTheme song.\n\"Creo en América\" (English: I Believe in America) by Argentine singer Diego Torres was the official theme song for the tournament.

The game focuses on an online community system serving detailed cricket stats for gamers through internet play in addition to a LAN based and offline component. It is the first ever video game developed by Pakistan to land on Steam.\nGameplay.\nThe primary mode of play involves online competition through multiplayer or local area network, giving players access to community and competitive features. It also keeps track of all the players' statistics, performance data, and match winning scores and innings. The tracked data is then posted online to overall leader board and ranking systems. Online leaderboards and scorecards allow access to batting and bowling statistics for all matches that they play across each season and see how they and their clubs rank against other individual players and rival clubs.\nThere are more than 30 shots with different uses depending on where the ball is going. Shots are played by pressing arrow keys at the right time. A double-tap of the left arrow key will attempt to play a cut shot with a right-handed batsman and tapping down then left will play a cover drive.\nCricket Revolution revolves around online play, although the game does not take emphasis away from its single player gameplay. There are three additional single player modes: A complete ten teams league, a knock out tournament and an exhibition match. Each of these modes can further be played with varying difficulties and in three different formats – 10, 20 or 50 overs per each side. Players are also provided with training sessions in net practice to get acquainted with the game.\nDevelopment.\nMindstorm Studios originally announced that the game would be only available via Steam with a targeted release date in September. However, the developers failed to meet the target date, stating that they were working on some minor gameplay issues."

Two years later he also won the gold medal at the 1970 European Badminton Championships in mixed doubles partnered by Susan Whetnall with whom he shared the All-England mixed doubles title in 1974. Eddy and Powell were men's doubles runners-up at the All-Englands in both 1969 and 1970.

        "text": "The Los Angeles Rugby Club (LARC) is a rugby union club in South Bay, Los Angeles, California, United States. It is a member of the Southern California Rugby Football Union within USA Rugby.\nHistory.\nCompeting continuously for over 50 years, The Los Angeles Rugby Club is the second oldest club in the Southern California Rugby Football Union (SCRFU). The Club was founded in 1958 as the Universities Rugby Club. Founding members included Al Williams and Dick Hyland, members of the Gold Medal winning 1924 USA Olympic Rugby Team.\nLos Angeles Rugby Club (LARC) has contributed extensively to the development of the game of Rugby Union Football on the Pacific Coast and the USA. Many teams can trace their beginnings to the direct effort of the Los Angeles R.C. or to former members who have relocated and founded clubs in their respective areas.\nIn 2004, LARC forged an informal partnership with the Manhattan Beach Youth Rugby Club a member of Southern California Youth Rugby, an autonomous subset of the SCRFU. LARC made this partnership official in 2013 when they merged with the Manhattan Beach Tykes which put 6 youth teams under the LARC umbrella; U8, U10, U12, U14, U16, and U18. LARC also had an informal partnership with Los Angeles Coast Women's Rugby Football Club that began in 2007 but ceased when the Coast team folded in 2011.\nLARC continues to wage very heated competition with long-time rivals Santa Monica Rugby Club, Old Mission Beach Athletic Club (OMBAC), and Belmont Shore RFC. In 1984, LARC was the Pacific Coast RFU Territorial Champion and Division 1 National Finalists. The 2007 road to the National Championship title ended just short bringing home the Div II 3rd place Cup, and a Southern California Championship. LARC returned to Div 1 in 2008 where they had an enormously successful season defeating OMBAC, Santa Monica, San Mateo and others on their way to the National Playoffs and a Div 1 #12 National Ranking. LARC met Life RFC in Austin, TX in the National Playoffs, LA came up short to Life RFC who went on to win the 2008 Div 1 National Championship. In 2009 LARC fell just short of their National Title aspirations again losing in the quarterfinals 7–15 to Aspen RFC who went on to win the 2009 Div 1 National Championships. LARC finished the 2009 season with a #8 National Ranking.\nNotable players.\nOn the pitch, LARC players have distinguished themselves at the highest levels. Our USA International players include: Barry Williams (Wing); Boyd Morrison (Center); Bill Brown (Hooker); Ray Nelson (Fullback); Steve Gray (Captain &amp; Flyhalf); John Mickel (Scrumhalf); Dave Surdyka (Flanker); Joe Clarkson (Flyhalf); John Jelaco (Prop); Michael Skahan (Wing); Rob Duncanson (Wing); Jamie Grant (Hooker). Ray Nelson, capped 25 times, is the eighth leading scorer in US history.\nOther International LARC players are: Doug Rollerson, Gary Cunningham (New Zealand); Ray Mordt (South Africa); Ernesto Ure (Argentina); Paul McNaughton (Ireland), Mick Jackman (Ireland A).\nThe current USA Rugby Sevens Head Coach, Al Caravelli is a former longtime LARC player. Other notable former LARC players now coaching include: Head Coach Marty Jones and Joe Katoa with LARC. Barry Williams with The San Pedro Rhinos; Steve Gray at U.C. Davis; Tim Hock &amp; Larry Docimo at Loyola Marymount University.\nPast SCRFU Presidents include Paul Ganey, and Jason Scott.\nCurrent notable players include long time LA flanker John Yuhas (Captain '11–'13), Bozho Deranja (Captain '06), front rows Nathanael Heiselt and George Kongakika, the Lock Dream Team (LDT) Mike Gorell and Kevin Kusiak, eight man Tala Gafe, long time LA fly half RJ Smith, inside center Adrian Ojeda, and utility back Chris Sweeny\nTournaments and Tours.\nThe Club currently hosts the popular Catalina Island Rugby Festival the first weekend in May. The tournament is administered by Tom Hendrix and LARC Honorary Life Member Joe Hendrix. These tournaments have raised funds for charitable contributions to The Special Olympics, The Wellness Community of the South Bay, and many others.\nThe Clubs tours and tournament play is an important part of their history. In 1967, LARC was the first mainland club side to tour Hawaii. In 1974 the Club had its first European trip – a two-week, five game tour of France and Belgium. LARC's host was French club Chateaurenard RFC, which in turn LARC hosted in 1975. In September 1977, the club toured Wales and Ireland and played eight matches. A five match tour to New Zealand followed in 1980.\nLARC has played host to many quality rugby touring sides visiting the U.S. Pacific Coast. Recent matches have been against teams such as: Club Pueyrredon, St. Andrews F.P. (Argentina); Ponsonby, Kaierau, Paeroa West (New Zealand); Paris University Club, Chateaurenard (France); Old Wesley, Clontarf, Old Crescent (Ireland); Sale, Orrell, Richmond, and Osterley (England). Recently LARC has joined up with the Malibu Rugby Club for a tour each year, trips have included Argentina/Uruguay and Eastern Europe with a South Africa trip planned in Feb/March 2015.\nThe Ganey Cup was and annual tournament that pitted southern California D1 teams with their Super League rivals. LARC lost in the Ganey Cup finals in 2008 to Belmont Shore, who went on to place 2nd in the nation in the Super League. In 2009 LARC placed 2nd again, this time falling short to the Las Vegas Rugby Club who went on to place 2nd in the nation, losing to Aspen in the National Finals."

Before then there had been events described as world championships but without ratification by a world cycling authority. The creation of the International Cycling Association in 1892 made internationally recognised championships possible.\nThey took place in Chicago, United States. There were three events: sprint, stayers' race (motor-paced) and a 10 km, now classified as a scratch race. The rules allowed for a team race but it was not held. Races were held only for amateurs. Winners received a gold medal and all other participants a silver.\nThe USA took two of the three gold medals. The table below shows the position had gold, silver and bronze medals been awarded.\nEvent overview.\nThe first Track Cycling World Championship was held over two days from August 11 to 12. Three events were held at the event with them being the Sprint, Motor-paced and the 10 km. These events were part of the Chicago World's Fair which took place from August 5-12. The three events was part of a week long schedule that also held local events with the major international races being on the weekend. Competitors from ten nations competed in the week long events with the main favorites being the American riders W.W Windle, Arthur Augustus Zimmerman and John S. Johnson.\nThe first two races of the weekend was the 10km and the sprint. In the 10km, Zimmerman broke the national record with a time of the 15:33 3-5. This improved on the previous record that was set by Seeley in the previous year by three minutes and seven seconds. Julian Perrin Bliss and Johnson rounded out the top three for the United States as every American but Bodes finished ahead of the internationals. Zimmerman then recorded a second win of the night as he won the sprint in only twenty-seven seconds, finishing well ahead of Johnston and Bliss who finished second and third where only American and Canadians riders competed.\nThe final major international race of the weekend was in the motor-paced with Lawrence Meintjes being the only non-American rider to win a medal at the championships as they finished ahead of Ernst Emil Ulbricht."

Pakistan began the tour after suffering One Day series defeats at the hands of both India and South Africa while Zimbabwe had lost a home series to West Indies prior to their arrival.\nZimbabwe named the same squad that lost 3–1 to the West Indies while Pakistan named uncapped Nasir Jamshed, Samiullah Khan and Kamran Hussain in their squad. Over the course of the series, they called up a number of uncapped and inexperienced players, including Abdur Rauf, Wahab Riaz, and Khurram Manzoor.\nSquads.\nKhalid Latif and Sohail Khan replaced Samiullah Khan and Sarfaraz Ahmed in Pakistan's squad before the 3rd ODI. For the 4th ODI, Khurram Manzoor and Wahab Riaz were included in Pakistan's squad, replacing Salman Butt and Yasir Arafat, while, Iftikhar Anjum and Kamran Akmal were given rest, and Sarfaraz Ahmed replaced Kamran Akmal as wicket-keeper for the remaining two ODIs.Shahid Afridi and Mohammad Yousuf both were rested for the 5th ODI and Rizwan Ahmed, Abdur Rauf, Naumanullah and Junaid Zia all were included in the squad.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nPakistan cruised to a facile victory on a batsman-friendly pitch in Karachi as five men, including debutant Nasir Jamshed scored half-centuries. Younus Khan, Mohammad Yousuf, Shoaib Malik and Misbah-ul-Haq were the other four with Younus top scoring with 79 as Pakistan posted a huge 347 for five from their overs. The Zimbabwe run chase got off to a bright start despite the early loss of Hamilton Masakadza as Vusi Sibanda and Chamu Chibhabha also passed fifty, adding 56 runs for the second wicket. Pakistan hit back with regular wickets, spinners Shoaib Malik and Shahid Afridi picking up five before them, slowing the Zimbabweans down and despite a late blast of 52 from Sean Williams, they were untroubled on their way to victory. Nasir was named man of the match for his 48-ball innings of 61 that included six fours and three sixes.\n2nd ODI.\nPakistan eased into a 2–0 series lead with Nasir Jamshed and Sohail Tanvir playing starring roles in Hyderabad. Batting first, Hamilton Masakadza and Tatenda Taibu, with 81, top scored for Zimbabwe but no other batsman could make a significant contribution, as Tanvir took career-best figures of four for 34, rendering their final score of 238 a modest one, at best. Jamshed, in only his second match, then smashed fifty from 43 balls, before he was eventually run out for 74 to put Zimbabwe on the back foot. They rallied, taking four more wickets, but a circumspect knock of 38 not out from Mohammad Yousuf and a belligerent 43 off 21 balls from Shahid Afridi ensured Pakistan made their target with 22 balls to spare.\n3rd ODI.\nPakistan were given a scare by Zimbabwe, for whom Tawanda Mupariwa took four top order wickets before Shahid Afridi with a characteristic innings of 85 from 52 balls helped Pakistan blast their way to 272 for nine from their 50 overs. It was by no means a commanding score, and when Sean Williams (71) and Brendan Taylor (55) were batting together, it looked like a shock was on the cards. However, once those two fell within 11 runs of each other, Pakistan regained control of the match and closed out a 37-run win that sealed the series.\n4th ODI.\nA Mohammad Yousuf century helped Pakistan into a 4–0 series lead after Zimbabwe had rallied to post a score of 244 in Faisalabad. Tatenda Taibu hit 51 and Sean Williams 48 before Shoaib Malik had both caught and bowled after they had shared a half-century stand. The innings stuttered before a late blast of 45 from 33 balls from Keith Dabengwa saw them get to their score of 244, bowled out in the final over. Pakistan lost their openers relatively quickly before a stand of 141 between Yousuf and Malik, who was run out for 88, ended any hopes Zimbabwe had of winning the game. Yousuf ended unbeaten on 108 not out with Malik awarded the man of the match having already taken three for 55.\n5th ODI.\nPakistan cruised to a 5–0 series clean sweep with debutants Abdur Rauf, Wahab Riaz and Khurram Manzoor playing starring roles. Brendan Taylor hit 50 for Zimbabwe, who won the toss and chose to bat, but they were undone by five wickets by Rauf and Riaz with captain Shoaib Malik chipping in with two, one of which Taylor immediately after he had reached a half-century. Zimbabwe were bowled out for a modest 183 in the 46th over. Nasir Jamshed fell early, but 50 runs on his debut from Manzoor and 63 from Younis Khan ensured Pakistan had no problem reaching their target, which they eventually did after 31 overs with Misbah-ul-Haq hitting a six to win the game."

        "text": "Frank Maurice Stinson Jenkins (July 6, 1859 – December 5, 1930) was an early amateur ice hockey player. He was a founder, and the first captain of the Ottawa Hockey Club (Ottawa HC) of 1883. He was also the founder in 1894 of Ottawa's first full-size orchestra, the Ottawa Amateur Orchestral Society.\nFamily.\nBorn in Kingston, United Province of Canada, Jenkins moved to Ottawa as a boy and resided in Ottawa ever since. He was a son of Charles W. Jenkins and Carolyn Counter Jenkins. He was the grandson of Kingston mayor John Counter. In 1892, Frank married Annie Lampman, a concert pianist and sister of Archibald Lampman. Frank and Anne had one son, Frank T. and three daughters, Dorothy, Ruth and Marjorie. Their daughter Dorothy Jenkins McCurry was a noted vocal soloist and teacher in Ottawa.\nIce hockey.\nIn 1883, after viewing the ice hockey tournament at the Montreal Winter Carnival, Halder Kirby and Jack Kerr returned to Ottawa, with a plan to form a hockey club. The Ottawa Hockey Club was formed, and Frank Jenkins was its first captain.\nThe club played in the Montreal tournaments in 1884 and 1885. In 1886, the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada (AHAC) league was formed with Ottawa one of the founding members. The Ottawa HC would play in the inaugural season of 1887, a season of challenges between teams, allowing the winner to be the current champion, with the final winner of the season considered Canadian champion. The club would not play in the AHAC again until 1891, and was dormant in 1888, restarting in 1889 after the opening of the Rideau Skating Rink. Jenkins would again be the captain.\nThe club would help found the Ontario Hockey Association in 1890, and was its first champion in the years 1890 to 1893. In 1891, Jenkins would assume the president title for the Ottawa HC, and in 1892, would assume the president title of the AHAC.\nCareer.\nJenkins is listed as a clerk for the Post Office, Main Ottawa Branch in the 1889–90 Ottawa Directory. He retired from the Post Office in 1928.\nMusic.\nJenkins was also a talented musician. In December 1885, he played in an organ recital at Christ Church of Ottawa where he opened the program with a \"meritorious and well-received playing\" of Mendelssohn's First Sonata. He was an organist at several churches in Ottawa: Knox Church in 1886 and 1887, Dominion Methodist from 1887 until 1895, St. Andrew's from 1895 to 1909, St. John's Anglican from 1910.\nJenkins, along with his wife Anne, founded Ottawa's first full-size orchestra, the Ottawa Amateur Orchestral Society in 1894. The Society's first performance was in December 1894. Jenkins would conduct the orchestra until 1900.\nHe also was an organizer of the Ottawa Schubert Club Choral Society, which became the \"Ottawa Choral Society\", from 1897 to 1914. The Society, a group of 175 amateurs, gave its first performance, with Jenkins conducting of \"Messiah\" on December 29, 1896, in the Grand Opera House.\nLater years.\nIn later years, Jenkins was a member of the Ottawa Canoe Club, Ottawa Lawn Bowling Club and the Rideau Curling Club and he also played golf and tennis. He died at his home at 216 Cooper Street in Ottawa after a short illness on December 5, 1930, and was interred on December 8, 1930, at Beechwood Cemetery."

        "text": "In field lacrosse, the goaltender (goalie, goalkeeper, or the keeper) is the most important and last line of defense between the opposing offense and the goal. The goaltender's primary roles are to defend the opposing team's shots on goal and to direct the defense.\nRules.\nGoaltenders are the only ones on the field who can touch the ball with their hands. However, they are not allowed to pick up or control the ball with their hands. Hand touches are legal only when in the crease. Each team has a goaltender on the field at all times. If the goaltender stops a shot by the opposing team, or picks the ball up any other way, the goaltender has 4 seconds in the crease to pass the ball or run with the ball. If the goaltender fails to do so, the ball will be awarded to the opposing team. After those 4 seconds, the goaltender must leave the crease. After the goaltender leaves the crease, they are given 20 seconds to \"clear\" the ball past the half of the field; if the goaltender fails to do so, the ball will be awarded to the opposing team.\nEquipment.\nA goaltender is required to wear certain protective gear. Every goaltender must wear gloves, a chest protector, a helmet, a throat guard, a mouth guard, and a protective cup. They optionally wear a padded girdle covering the waist to the thigh and elbow pads. Goaltenders' lacrosse stick can vary between the length of the short and long sticks of field players depending on age and preference. The head of the goalie's stick can be up to 12 inches at its widest point.\nRole.\nThe goaltender's role is to prevent the ball from going into the goal. Primarily, goalies use their stick to block shots. However, many saves are off the goalie's body or helmet. \nPenalties.\nThe goaltender is treated like a field player for all technical and personal fouls. In addition, upon controlling the ball in his stick within the crease, the goalie has four seconds to either pass or run the ball outside of the crease. No player may carry the ball into the crease, but a goalie in the crease can receive a pass, at which point a four-second count begins. Outside the crease, the goaltender has no special protections, and may bring the ball into the offensive zone and even score.\nRecords.\nBrett Queener holds the NCAA record for most goals scored by a goaltender with 5 career goals. Greg Cattrano and Brian Dougherty hold the record as three time Major League Lacrosse Goaltender of the Year Award winners. Cattrano is the only goaltender to have won the Major League Lacrosse MVP Award."

This may be through either the front of the watch, the back of the watch or a small cut outlining the dial.\nTrue 'skeletonization' also includes the trimming away of any non-essential metal on the bridge, plate, wheel train or any other mechanical part of the watch, leaving only a minimalist 'bare' skeleton of the movement required for functionality. Often, the remaining thinned movement is decorated with engraving. This can be with or without a dial face that allows the user to see through to the movement.\nDesigns also providing a glimpse of the movement but requiring less modification to the movement itself are the “semi-skeleton” design, with a partial cutaway of the watch face to view the workings of the movement underneath, and the “open heart” design, with a (usually circular) window to view the oscillation of the balance wheel, the “beating heart” of the watch. The “open heart” design is especially common on watches with a tourbillon complication, the better to show off what is regarded as an example of watchmaking virtuosity."

He achieved his career-high Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ranking of world No. 5 on 16 July 2018. He was the first South African to be ranked in the top 5 since Kevin Curren was No. 5 on 23 September 1985.\nIn February 2011, Anderson won his first ATP Tour title at the South African Open in his hometown of Johannesburg. Anderson reached his first major final at the 2017 US Open, where he lost to Rafael Nadal. In the 2018 Wimbledon semifinals, Anderson reached his second major final by defeating American John Isner in the second-longest match in the history of major tournaments, at 6 hours and 36 minutes (second only to the 2010 match between John Isner and Nicolas Mahut). He then lost to Novak Djokovic in the final. On 3 May 2022, Anderson retired at age 35, but he announced his comeback in July 2023.\nEarly years.\nAnderson started playing tennis at age six and was competitive in 800-metre races at school. On the eve of their meeting in the finals at the 2017 US Open, it emerged that as a 12-year old, Anderson regularly competed against future world number one Rafael Nadal on the juniors circuit.\nCollegiate career.\nAnderson played three seasons of college tennis in the United States at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He was a three-time All-American in singles and two-time All-American in doubles. During his sophomore year (2005–06), he won the national doubles championships with playing partner Ryan Rowe.\nIn 2007, Anderson led Illinois to a runner-up team finish, losing to host Georgia on their home courts.

        "text": "Ian Stanley Talbot Smith (20 August 1941 – 29 September 2017) was an international New Zealand rugby union player who had several seasons in All Blacks test sides during the 1960s. Smith was chosen for the Otago provincial side for the first time in 1961. During those years Smith played mainly as a centre. Smith was part of the South Island team who had a surprise win against the North Island in 1963.\nRepresentatives.\nIn the 1963 trial Smith was switched to the wing and he ended up scoring two tries to beat Don McKay who had played against England earlier in the season. Smith got picked for the All Blacks because of his strength and direct running near the goalline. Smith was the left wing understudy of Ralph Caulton and did not appear in any of the five internationals. But he did score eight tries in 15 matches.\nColts/Under 23s.\nSmith toured Australia in 1964 with a team called New Zealand Colts, which was an under 23 team.\n1964.\n1964 saw Smith make his test debut against the touring Wallabies when he played in all three Bledisloe Cup matches, and he appears for the second time in an interisland match. This took his appearances for Otago to 37, but he then moved to represent North Otago for 12 matches in 1965–66 followed by Southland's 18 in 1966–68.\nTouring Springboks.\nIn 1965 whilst playing for North Otago the Springboks were touring in New Zealand and Smith was chosen to captain the combined North Otago, South Canterbury and Mid Canterbury team against Springboks, when he played three tests. Although replaced for the third by Malcolm Dick, he returned for the fourth scoring two tries (his only test tries) in the 20–3 win.\nHe played the first three tests in 1966 against the British Lions but Malcolm Dick had returned from injury so Smith was dropped for the fourth test. In 1967 he attended the trials for the Britain and France tour but in his second match his team was thrashed 37–0 and like many of his teammates, he was overlooked in the final selection. In 1968 he played in his last major game for Southland who only just lost to France 8–6.\nPersonal life.\nSmith was born to George and Noelie Smith (née Talbot). He had two sisters, Christine and Jacquetta. Smith was married to Jennifer Margaret \"Jenny\" Smith, who died in 2015; they had four sons: Gareth, Hamish, Tim and Matthew."

        "text": "The Victoria Cup was series of games played between professional ice hockey teams from Europe and the North American National Hockey League (NHL). The event was held twice, in 2008 and 2009.\nHistory.\nThe Victoria Cup was announced in 2007 as one of the highlight events to celebrate 2008, the 100th anniversary of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). The Victoria Cup was named to commemorate the first recorded organised indoor ice hockey game, played in 1875 at the Victoria Skating Rink in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.\nIn the two editions of the event held, different criteria were used to choose the competing teams. One challenger, from Europe, was the winner of the IIHF European Champions Cup (in the 2009 edition) and then the Champions Hockey League (2009 edition). The other, from North America, was chosen by the NHL head office from among the teams that opened their NHL seasons with games in Europe. The IIHF publicly stated their wish to have the NHL champions (winners of the Stanley Cup) represent the NHL, but the NHL did not agree to that proposal, though the Chicago Blackhawks who challenged for the Victoria Cup in 2009 would go on to win the Stanley Cup during the 2009–10 season.\n2008 Victoria Cup.\nOn October 1, 2008, the first Victoria Cup was awarded to the New York Rangers who won 4–3 against the Metallurg Magnitogorsk, winners of the 2008 European Champions Cup. The game was played under IIHF rules at the PostFinance Arena in Bern, Switzerland. Referees were split between the NHL and the IIHF.\nThe match was preceded by an exhibition game on September 30, 2008, between host SC Bern and the New York Rangers, which was won by the Rangers. It was the first time a Swiss club played against an NHL team. The Rangers followed the Victoria Cup game with two NHL regular season games against the Tampa Bay Lightning in Prague, Czech Republic, on October 4 and 5 at O2 Arena.\n2009 Victoria Cup.\nThe second edition was contested by the ZSC Lions, champions of the Champions Hockey League, and the Chicago Blackhawks. The match was played on September 29, 2009 at the Hallenstadion in Zürich, Switzerland. ZSC Lions defeated the Blackhawks 2–1.\n2010–present.\nThe Champions Hockey League was cancelled after the 2008–09 season with the IIHF originally announcing that the third edition of the Victoria Cup would feature an NHL team against a team from one of the top four European ice hockey leagues (KHL, SM-liiga, Czech Extraliga or Elitserien). However, the event was not held since the 2009 edition.\nTrophy.\nThe IIHF commissioned a new trophy designed by GDE Bertoni, which designed the FIFA World Cup Trophy. The Victoria Cup is a gold cup with 12 Perspex – a thermoplastic material – light blue ice hockey sticks, six on each side, sitting on a marble case and forming a \"V\" coming up and out of the Cup. The names of the winning clubs are engraved on the back of the sticks."

        "text": "Marco René Estrada (born July 5, 1983) is a Mexican-American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals, Milwaukee Brewers, Toronto Blue Jays, and Oakland Athletics. He was an All-Star in 2016.\nEarly life.\nEstrada graduated from Sylmar High School in Sylmar, California, and then attended Glendale Community College and Long Beach State University. He was selected by the Washington Nationals in the sixth round of the 2005 Major League Baseball draft.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Nationals.\nAfter being drafted by Washington, Estrada began his minor league career pitching for the Vermont Expos in the short-season New York–Penn League. In three starts and six relief appearances, he pitched innings, compiling a win–loss record of 1–3 and an ERA of 5.08. During that time, he struck out 37 batters while issuing 16 walks.\nEstrada spent the 2006 season with the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League Nationals, and the Savannah Sand Gnats of the Class-A South Atlantic League. He posted a record of 3 wins and 4 losses and a 3.98 ERA over 61 innings, consisting of 12 starts and 1 appearance in relief, striking out a total of 56 batters and walking 20.\nIn 2007, Estrada pitched for the GCL Nationals, the Class-A Hagerstown Suns of the South Atlantic League, and the Advanced-A Potomac Nationals of the Carolina League. He logged innings in 23 starts, winning 6, losing 8, and recording a 4.85 ERA with 102 strikeouts and 37 walks.\nEstrada began the 2008 season with the Harrisburg Senators of the Double-A Eastern League, where he pitched innings in 13 starts, posting an ERA of 2.66, striking out 67 batters and walking 32. In June he was promoted to the Syracuse Chiefs of the Triple-A International League. He was called up to the majors on August 19 and made his debut the next day. He made 11 appearances as a reliever that season. He pitched in four games (including one start) for the Nationals in 2009, but played the majority of the season with Syracuse.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn February 3, 2010, Estrada was claimed off waivers by the Milwaukee Brewers. He began the season with the Triple-A Pacific Coast League's Nashville Sounds. He was recalled to the big league club and made his Brewers debut on May 18, entering the game against the Cincinnati Reds as a relief pitcher in the 5th inning. He recorded nine consecutive outs through three innings before giving up a solo home run to Joey Votto in the bottom of the 8th. He also made his first official at-bat in that game, grounding out in the 6th. He was outrighted to Nashville after the season.\nOn April 6, 2011, Estrada was again called up to the majors, taking the injured Zack Greinke's spot in the starting rotation. Estrada became the long reliever and the backup starter for the Brewers pitching rotation.\n2011 was Estrada's first successful season in the major leagues. Between being the long reliever and backup starter (starting in a total of seven games), Estrada pitched in 92.2 innings, posted a 4.08 ERA, and struck out 88 batters for an impressive 8.5 K/9. It was by far Estrada's most productive stint in the majors. From 2008 to 2010, Estrada only pitched in a total of 31.1 innings, and never posted an ERA below 6.00.\nEstrada spent almost the entire 2012 season in the starting rotation after a season-ending injury to Chris Narveson and an injury and eventual release of Randy Wolf. As a result, Estrada had the best season of his career, posting a 5–7 record, a 3.64 ERA in 138.1 innings to go along with 143 strikeouts. On January 18, 2013, the Brewers announced they had avoided arbitration with Estrada, signing him to a one-year contract worth $1.955 million.\nAfter spending three seasons as a long reliever and alternative starter, Estrada was named to the Brewers starting rotation for the 2013 season. He posted a 7–4 record in 2013, with a 3.87 ERA and 118 strikeouts in 21 starts. In 2014, Estrada made 39 appearances for the Brewers, including 18 starts. He pitched to a 7–6 record, 4.36 ERA, and 127 strikeouts in 150 innings pitched.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn November 1, 2014, Estrada was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Adam Lind. He and the Blue Jays avoided salary arbitration when he agreed to a one-year, $3.9 million contract on January 16, 2015. Estrada opened spring training in competition for the fifth starter role with Aaron Sanchez. He began the 2015 regular season in the bullpen, but was moved into the starting rotation after the Blue Jays optioned Daniel Norris to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons on May 1. On June 19, he took a no-hitter into the 8th inning against the Baltimore Orioles, which was broken up by a bloop single from Jimmy Paredes. In his next start, he took a perfect game into the 8th, which ended when Logan Forsythe hit a weak infield single. Estrada became the first player to lose no-hit bids in the 8th inning or later in consecutive games since Dave Stieb did so in 1988. Estrada continued his strong play to the end of the season, and had the best season of his career, finishing with a 13–8 record, 3.13 ERA, and 131 strikeouts in a career-high 181 innings pitched. He led the major leagues in holding opposing batters to the lowest batting average on balls in play (.216).\nOn October 11, Estrada made his first career postseason start, and held the Texas Rangers to 1 run over 6, earning the win as the Blue Jays avoided elimination. He started game 1 of the 2015 American League Championship Series, taking the loss as the Blue Jays were shut out by the Kansas City Royals, 5–0. Down 3–1 in the series, Estrada started game 5 for Toronto on Oct. 21 and held Kansas City to 1 run over 7, avoiding elimination for the second time in the 2015 postseason with a 7–1 victory. He faced the minimum number of hitters through 6, the longest such streak for an American League starting pitcher in a postseason game since Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956.\nEstrada received a $15.8 million qualifying offer from the Blue Jays on November 6, and later agreed to a two-year, $26 million contract on November 13, 2015. On November 18, Estrada finished in 10th place in the American League Cy Young Award voting, receiving one 4th place vote and one 5th place vote. On December 17, the Toronto chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America voted Estrada the Blue Jays' Pitcher of the Year.\nEstrada opened the 2016 regular season on the disabled list with a back injury. He made his season debut on April 10, and pitched seven shutout innings against the Boston Red Sox, leading the Blue Jays to a 3–0 victory in his 100th career start. In a 7–2 victory against the Philadelphia Phillies on June 15, Estrada set a Blue Jays franchise record by allowing 5 or fewer hits in 10 consecutive starts. On June 21, he set an MLB record by having eleven straight starts pitching six innings and allowing five hits or fewer. Estrada was named an All-Star for the first time in his career on July 5. In his first 10 starts after the All-Star break, Estrada would struggle to a 3–6 record and a 5.47 ERA. In his start on September 14, he became the first Blue Jay to strikeout five consecutive batters to begin a game. The following day, Jon Morosi of MLB Network tweeted Estrada had been pitching with a herniated disk in his back since the All-Star break. For the season, he was 9–9 with a 3.48 ERA, and again led the major leagues in holding opposing batters to the lowest batting average on balls in play (.234). He also led all major league pitchers in changeup percentage (28.6%). In Game 1 of the 2016 ALDS against the Texas Rangers, Estrada came within two outs of a complete-game shutout, before an Elvis Andrus triple ended his outing. He would receive the win with one earned run allowed in the 10–1 Blue Jays victory.\nOn March 26, 2017, Blue Jays manager John Gibbons announced Estrada would get the start on Opening Day. Estrada finished with a career-worst 4.98 ERA, despite posting career highs in innings (186) and strikeouts (176).

        "title": "John Barclay (rugby union)",
        "text": "John Adam Barclay (born 25 September 1986) is a Scottish former rugby union player, who played as a flanker and Number 8. He made 76 international appearances for the Scotland national team 2007–2019. He played at three world cups. He played club rugby for Glasgow Warriors, Scarlets and Edinburgh Rugby.\nEarly life.\nBarclay was born in Hong Kong, where he went to Bradbury School, discovering mini rugby at Stanley Fort RFC.\nBarclay later attended Dollar Academy in Scotland, where he captained the school's 1st XV to victory against the High School of Dundee in the Scottish Schools Cup final at Murrayfield in 2004.\nCareer.\nBarclay joined Glasgow Warriors as an apprentice in 2004.\nImmediately after leaving school, while still only 17, he was invited to train with the Scotland squad by then-coach Matt Williams. After Williams' departure Barclay was not picked for the Scotland squad again until the 2007 World Cup after a run of strong performances for club side Glasgow Warriors. He made his debut against New Zealand in the pool stages in a weakened team, losing 40–0.\nAfter the 2007 World Cup Barclay started to become involved with the Scotland squad more and became a permanent starter until the end of the 2011 World Cup.\nBarclay was man of the match in Scotland's win over South Africa at Murrayfield in 2010, and became recognised for his skills at the breakdown, and his role in the \"Killer Bs\" back row (Barclay, Johnnie Beattie and Kelly Brown). He was also selected in the Pro12 Dream Team at the end of the 2009/10 season.\nAfter Scotland's exit at the pool stages of the 2011 World Cup (the first time that they hadn't reached the knock-out stages) Barclay found himself dropped from the Scotland starting XV for Edinburgh flanker Ross Rennie during the 2012 6 Nations Championship.\nBarclay was picked for Scotland's summer tour to Australia and the Pacific Islands by then Scotland coach Andy Robinson. He played in Scotland's victory over Australia in Newcastle but then returned home for personal reasons, missing out on the following victory over Samoa.\nIn March 2012 Barclay signed a one-year contract extension, with an option to agree a further year. After overcoming a series of injuries at the start of the 2012–13 season Barclay regained his form for Glasgow at the end of the season and started most games whilst Chris Fusaro suffered with injury. It was announced in the second half of the season that Glasgow had controversially reneged on a contract offer and that Barclay would join the Scarlets on a three-year contract for the next season. He helped Glasgow to a third-place finish in the Pro12 and a play-off spot away to Leinster, a game which the Warriors narrowly lost.\nBarclay missed Scotland's 2013 summer tour to South Africa due to requiring surgery. He started the 2013–14 season with the Scarlets and was part of the Scotland squad for the 2013 Autumn Internationals, winning a cap against South Africa at Murrayfield on 17 November 2013, when he came on as a substitute on 64 minutes.\nBarclay missed inclusion for the 2014 Six Nations squad despite many believing Scotland lacked a traditional openside flanker. Following the appointment of Vern Cotter as Scotland coach, Barclay was not included in any of his Scotland squads in the first year, including Cotter's first Six Nations. However he was picked in the wider 2015 World Cup training squad and earned his first cap since 2013 in the second warm-up match against Italy in August 2015. Although omitted from the final World Cup squad, Barclay was once again included in the Scotland squad for the 2016 Six Nations Championship and started the first four games at blindside flanker, scoring a try in the win over Italy.\nIn the opening match of the 2017 Six Nations Championship, Barclay was a second-half substitute in Scotland's victory over Ireland at Murrayfield. He started the following week against France, in a game that saw captain Greig Laidlaw get injured. Barclay assumed the captaincy for the final three games of the championship, which included a win over Wales for the first time in ten years. Scotland ended the campaign with three wins from five.\nOn 17 November 2017 it was announced that he had signed a two-year contract with Edinburgh Rugby from the start of the 2018–19 season, however a ruptured Achilles tendon delayed his debut until March 2019.\nOn 4 December 2019 Barclay announced his retirement from international rugby, after winning 76 caps and playing in 3 World Cups.\nOn 22 April 2020, Edinburgh's coach confirmed that Barclay's contract would not be renewed. Barclay had played fourteen matches for Edinburgh- this low number of appearances being due to a combination of injuries and international duties. In June he spoke of having a desire to continue playing rugby, despite the shutdown from the coronavirus pandemic reducing any prospects of recruitment within club rugby. On 15 August 2020 Barclay announced his retirement from professional rugby. After retiring he is now a pundit covering all Scotland games actively."

        "title": "List of participating nations at the Winter Olympic Games",
        "text": "This is a list of nations, as represented by National Olympic Committees (NOCs), that have participated in the Winter Olympic Games between 1924 and 2022. The Winter Olympic Games have been held every four years (once during each Olympiad) since 1924, except for the cancelled Games of 1940 and 1944, and in 1994 when the Winter Games were moved to the middle of the Olympiad, two years after the previous Games.\n129 NOCs (118 of the current 206 NOCs and 11 obsolete NOCs) have participated in at least one Winter Games, and twelve nations (Austria, Canada, Finland, France, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States) have participated in all twenty-three Winter Games to date. Including continuity from Czechoslovakia, the Czech Republic and Slovakia have also been represented in every edition.\nHistory.\nOrigin and early Games.\nThe first winter sport to be contested at the modern Olympic Games was figure skating at the 1908 Games in London. A total of 21 skaters from six countries (Argentina, Germany, Great Britain, Sweden, Russia, and the United States) competed in four events on 28–29 October.\nSkating was not in the program of the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, but returned for the 1920 Games in Antwerp. Ice hockey was also part of the 1920 program of events, with seven teams competing.\nThe first Winter Games were held in 1924, in Chamonix, France. They were originally called \"International Winter Sports Week\" and held in association with the 1924 Summer Olympics, but were in retrospect designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as the \"I Olympic Winter Games\".\nSixteen nations participated in these Games: fourteen from Europe and two from North America.\nFour years later, 25 nations were represented at the 1928 Winter Olympics, in St. Moritz, Switzerland, including Argentina (the first nation from the Southern Hemisphere), Japan (the first Asian nation), and Mexico.\nThe 1932 Games, held in Lake Placid, United States, saw the participation of 17 nations.\nThe 1936 Winter Games, in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany, had 28 participating nations, the largest number to that date.\nThese would be the last Winter Games for twelve years, as the planned 1940 Games and 1944 Games were cancelled due to World War II.\nPost-war years and Cold War era.\nAfter the war, 28 nations would return to St. Moritz for the 1948 Winter Olympics, but not Germany or Japan, who were not invited because of their roles in the war.\nThe 1952 Winter Games in Oslo, Norway, featured 30 participating nations.\nThe 1956 Games in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, marked the Winter Games debut of the Soviet Union, along with 31 other nations.\nThe NOCs of East Germany and West Germany would be represented by a single German team, an arrangement that would continue until 1964.\nThirty nations would participate at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, United States, including South Africa, the first African nation to participate in the Winter Games.\nThirty-six nations were represented in Innsbruck, Austria, in 1964.\nThe 1968 Winter Olympics in Grenoble, France, marked the first time that East Germany and West Germany competed as independent teams, two of the 37 nations that took part.\nThe Games of 1972 were held in Sapporo, Japan, the first time the Winter Games were held outside of Europe or North America. A total of 35 nations were represented, including the Philippines, the first appearance by a southeast Asian nation.\nThe Winter Games returned to Innsbruck, in 1976, with 37 participating nations.\nLake Placid was the site of the Winter Games in 1980, with 37 competing nations.\nThe People's Republic of China made their Olympic debut but, in response, the Republic of China boycotted the Games, protesting their inability to use the name \"China\" after the decision by the IOC. Sarajevo, SFR Yugoslavia was host to the 1984 Winter Olympics, which welcomed 49 nations.\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands were the first two Caribbean NOCs to compete in the Winter Games.\nSeveral more tropical nations would participate at the 1988 Winter Olympics, in Calgary, Canada, including the famed Jamaica national bobsleigh team.\nRecent Games.\nThe post-Cold War events of the early 1990s led to a large increase in participating nations at the Olympics. At the 1992 Games, in Albertville, France, a total of 64 NOCs were represented, including a single Germany team—following the German reunification in 1990—and a Unified Team composed of six of the ex-republics of the Soviet Union.\nThe Baltic states competed independently for the first time since 1936, and some of the ex-Yugoslav nations started to compete independently in 1992.\nIn October 1986, the IOC had voted to hold the Olympic Winter Games halfway through the four-year Olympiad, rather than in the same year as the summer Games, and this change started with the XVIIth Olympic Winter Games in 1994 in Lillehammer, Norway. A total of 67 nations took part, including the Czech Republic and Slovakia as independent teams, and each of the ex-Soviet nations. Pakistan debuted in the Winter Olympics in 2010. Nigeria debuted in the Winter Olympics several years later, in 2018.\nThe Winter Games continued to grow in the recent past, with 72 nations at the 1998 Winter Olympics, in Nagano, Japan, 77 nations at the 2002 Winter Olympics, in Salt Lake City, United States, 80 nations at the 2006 Winter Olympics, in Turin, Italy, 82 nations at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, 88 nations at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, and a record 93 nations at the 2018 Games.\nList of nations.\nDescription.\nThis list includes 129 NOCs (118 of the current 206 NOCs and 11 obsolete NOCs), arranged alphabetically. The three-letter country code is also listed for each NOC. Since the 1960s, these codes have been frequently used by the IOC and each Games organizing committee to identify NOCs, such as within the official report of each Games. However, in this section, several countries which have long-form names designated by the United Nations are referred to by their common names, such as Laos (Lao People's Democratic Republic), North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), and Moldova (Republic of Moldova).\nSeveral nations have changed during their Olympic history. Name changes due to geographical renaming are explained by footnotes after the nation's name, and other changes are explained by footnotes links within the table itself.\nObsolete nations.\nObsolete nations are included in the table to more clearly illustrate past Olympic appearances for their successor nations.\nNations that have never competed.\n88 of the 206 active NOCs have yet to compete in a Winter Olympics."

There were a total of 36 participating athletes, with two qualifying heats and the final held on Sunday September 6, 1987.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nFinal.\nThis final was a rather typical \"kicker's race,\" with a mostly slow early pace, and a very quick last lap. The strongest pre-race favourite, Morocco's Said Aouita, led for over 200 metres. After that, Kenya's John Ngugi moved into the lead. However, until about 2,200 metres, he ran wide either on the second lane or on the first lane's outer edge. After 900 metres, Ireland's John Treacy injected a more respectable speed into the sluggish early race. Despite his noticeable acceleration, Treacy's 1,000-metre split was only 2:49.96. After 1,600 metres, Ngugi again took the lead. As he led the 15-man field through 2,000 metres in 5:34.93, the runners were tightly clustered behind him. After 2,200 metres, the Kenyan suddenly surged. Only Aouita and Ireland's Frank O'Mara followed Ngugi closely. Before that lap was over, however, Ngugi slowed down again, and the field closed the gap on him. Due to Ngugi's surge, the 3,000-metre split was 8:16.19. The pace remained moderate during the fourth kilometre, with Ngugi leading at 4,000 metres in 10:58.60. Then the field began to break up. Britain's Steve Ovett, Ireland's Treacy, Canada's Carey Nelson, and Spain's Abel Anton started to lose contact with the main group. Another pre-race favourite, Switzerland's Pierre Deleze, had accelerated to the third place behind Ngugi and Aouita at 4,000 metres. Ovett was able to temporarily catch the leaders by 4,400 metres. Sydney Maree of the United States had drifted to the rear of the main group. By the second last home straight, also Ireland's O'Mara began to struggle with the increasing pace. Shortly before 4,600 metres, Aouita eased past Ngugi, and the Moroccan's unofficial split at 4,600 metres was 12:33.52. Portugal's Domingos Castro sprinted past Deleze into the second place on the final lap's front bend. Britain's Jack Buckner, Belgium's Vincent Rousseau, Ngugi, Bulgaria's Evgeni Ignatov, Britain's Tim Hutchings, Portugal's Dionisio Castro, O'Mara, Maree, and Ovett were still in contention. However, on the final back straight, Aouita further accelerated his pace, and only Domingos Castro and Deleze were able to follow him. Buckner and Rousseau formed the first chasing group, with Ignatov, Hutchings, and Dionisio Castro fighting for the sixth place. Ngugi drifted to the leading group's rear, and Ovett and Maree were about to pass him. By 4,800 metres, Aouita's victory already started to look certain, but Domingos Castro tenaciously remained ahead of Deleze. On the final home straight, Aouita's superior middle-distance runner's speed took him to an easy and clear victory. Domingos Castro was able to secure the silver medal, while Deleze faded badly during the last 20 metres, losing the bronze medal to the quickly finishing Buckner. Unofficially, Aouita sprinted the final 400 metres in 52.92 seconds.

        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 5,000 metres event at the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, West Germany, held at Neckarstadion on 28 and 31 August 1986. There were a total number of 28 participating athletes, with two qualifying heats.\nFinal.\nThis final was run mostly at a fast pace. The Italians, Britons and Portuguese tried some team tactics during the race. Italy's Salvatore Antibo led until about 500 metres, after which his famous teammate Alberto Cova took over. Both were clearly trying to help their teammate Stefano Mei, who had surprisingly defeated the defending champion Cova on the opening day, in the 10,000-metre race. Shortly after Cova had passed 1,000 metres in the lead in 2:39.04, Portugal's Fernando Couto accelerated to the front, to help his well-known teammate António Leitão, the defending Olympic bronze medalist at this distance. Couto was still leading at 2,000 metres in 5:19.72. Shortly thereafter, Cova passed Couto, who quickly drifted to the rear of the field, to join West Germany's Uwe Mönkemeyer, Czechoslovakia's Ivan Uvizl and Britain's Steve Ovett, who had apparently lost his best shape for the 1986 season. After his stunningly easy victory at the Commonwealth Games 5,000-metre race, Ovett had been considered a favourite also for the European Championships final. However, he had struggled to qualify for this final, and already during the first lap, he had drifted to the last place. After 2,300 metres, Leitão re-took the lead from Cova. Before 3,000 metres (which Leitão passed in 7:58.97), Ovett, Uvizl, Couto, Mönkemeyer and Antibo had dropped from the lead group. Exhausted, Ovett dropped out of the final altogether at 3,000 metres. The pace temporarily slowed down, with a couple of laps over 65 seconds. After 3,600 metres, Britain's Tim Hutchings went into the lead, and began to gradually improve the pace. His remaining teammate Jack Buckner followed well in contention. Surprisingly, the defending Olympic silver medalist at this distance, Switzerland's Markus Ryffel dropped out before 3,900 metres, while still in the lead group. After 3,900 metres, Belgium's Vincent Rousseau lost contact with the lead group. So tired out was the Belgian that he jogged the last 1,000 metres in over 3 minutes. Shortly after Hutchings had covered 4,000 metres in the lead, with a time of 10:42.20, Finland's Martti Vainio and Switzerland's Pierre Délèze dropped from the lead group. Before 4,300 metres, Cova also tired out, to the surprise of many spectators. Although Leitão passed Cova, he was unable to keep up with Hutchings, Buckner, Mei, and Bulgaria's Evgeni Ignatov. Buckner took the lead at 4,600 metres, with a split time of about 12:14. About 100 metres later, Ignatov dropped from the top group. Before 4,800 metres, Mei managed to pass Buckner. In the first half of the final bend, Hutchings dropped from Mei's pace, but in the second half of the bend, Buckner kicked past Mei. He widened his lead to almost 1.5 seconds, to win in a new European Championships record time of 13:10.15. \nUnofficially, he ran the last lap in 56.14 seconds.

During the first years, the original group of players recruited some USMC officers also taking courses in International Diplomacy and various SAIS students to the team. By 1973 many of the founding members had graduated and left the city, so the club changed its name to West Potomac Rugby Football Club after its practice and match pitch at West Potomac Park.\n1974-1999.\nDuring this time, West Potomac continued to compete in the Mid-Atlantic region as well as participating in international rugby tours to Barbados, South Africa, Ireland, France, and the Bahamas.\nRecent History.\nIn 2000, West Potomac won the PRU Men's DIII Championship and the club was profiled in a \"Rugby Magazine\" article that discussed the club's history and its strong ties to the armed forces. The club was featured in \"Rugby Magazine\" the following year as well, this time as the \"Tullamore Dew Team of the Month\" for May 2002. Since then, the club has been featured in articles appearing in \"The Washington Post\" and \"Voice of the Hill\", as well as additional \"Rugby Magazine\" stories.\nWest Potomac RFC became a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in 2002 and incorporated under the name DC Rugby, Inc. In addition to overseeing the activities of West Potomac RFC, DC Rugby works with organizations in and around the D.C.-Metro area to promote the sport of rugby.\nAfter losing only one match during 2006 PRU regular season competition, West Potomac went undefeated in Fall 2007 to once again win the DIII men's championship and secure a berth in the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union playoffs for the third time in the past four years. During the 2007 season, the club finished 9-0 and outscored opponents 231 to 17.\nSponsorship.\nPabst Blue Ribbon has been West Potomac's primary sponsor since 2006.

The American League and National League both featured ten teams, with each team playing a 162-game schedule.\nIn the World Series, the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the New York Yankees in four straight games. The Dodgers' stellar pitching staff, anchored by left-hander Sandy Koufax and right-hander Don Drysdale, was so dominant that the vaunted Yankees, despite the presence of sluggers such as Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris in their lineup, never took a lead against Los Angeles the entire Series.\nMLB statistical leaders.\n1 National League Triple Crown Pitching Winner\nSeason recap.\nIn the American League, the Yankees were in the 4th of 5 straight pennant winning years, and, led by MVP Elston Howard, cruised to the American League title by 10.5 games over the 2nd place White Sox.\nIn the National League, most experts figured the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers would be locked in another battle for the pennant, much like 1962 when the Giants came from behind and beat the Dodgers in a playoff. The Dodgers started slowly, perhaps feeling the hangover effect from blowing the pennant the year before. They were 2 games under .500 in early May, and trailed the surprising St. Louis Cardinals by 4.5 games. Then their pitching asserted itself, and on August 28, the Dodgers led the Giants by 5.5 games and the Cardinals by 6.5 games. The Cardinals proceeded to win 19 of their next 20 games and, while the Dodgers didn't exactly slump, they went \"only\" 14–7 during that same period. Thus, the Dodgers went into St. Louis on September 16 to play the Cardinals in a 3-game series leading by only 1 game. With the memory of blowing the 1962 pennant fresh in their minds, the Dodgers proceeded to sweep the Cardinals and take a 4-game lead with 7 games to go. The key game was the third one; the Cardinals led 5–1 in the 8th inning and a win would move them back to within 2 games of L.A. But the Dodgers got 3 in the 8th and in the top of the 9th, late season call up Dick Nen, in only his 8th major league at bat, hit a pinch hit homer to force extra innings. The Cardinals got a leadoff triple from Dick Groat in the 10th but could not score. The Dodgers then scored an unearned run in the 13th inning and won, 6–5. The disheartened Cardinals then lost their next 3 games as well while the Dodgers won 3 of their next 4 to clinch the pennant with 6 games left.\nPostseason.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket/&gt;\n&lt;section end=Bracket/&gt;\nUniforms.\nIn an attempt to create an identity distinguishable from all other teams, Kansas City Athletics owner Charlie Finley changed the team uniforms to kelly green and yellow. This tradition of \"green and gold\" has been preserved to this day, although the kelly green has since been replaced with forest green. Finley also changed the Athletics' cleats to white instead of the standard black. Coaches and managers were also given white hats, which were dropped when the Athletics adopted new colors in 1993. The white cleats were dropped in 2000, but were revived in 2008.\nTelevision coverage.\nCBS and NBC aired weekend \"Game of the Week\" broadcasts.

In the middle of the 1958 campaign, he was traded along with Tito Francona to the Detroit Tigers for Ray Boone and Bob Shaw. He was eventually claimed by the Washington Senators, who traded him back to Detroit in for Tom Morgan.\nFischer was later traded to the Kansas City Athletics with Ozzie Virgil for Gerry Staley and Reno Bertoia. There, he set a major league record which still stands in pitching 84 consecutive innings without issuing a walk in .\nThis didn't keep Fischer in Kansas City for long, however. After one more season with the A's, the Minnesota Twins drafted Fischer in the Rule 5 draft in 1963, and he concluded his big-league career with the club, spending a few months of the 1964 season on the inactive list as a Minnesota scout. The White Sox signed Fischer as an active player and free agent following his stint with the Twins, but he never returned to the majors and was released in 1968.\nCoaching career.\nAfter the season, he joined the fledgling Kansas City Royals, an expansion team set to make its MLB debut in , as a scout, beginning his association with future Baseball Hall of Fame executive John Schuerholz. He also served as a minor league pitching instructor in the Royals' organization. Although Fischer never was MLB pitching coach of the Kansas City club, he held that post with the Cincinnati Reds (1979–83), Boston Red Sox (1985–91) and Tampa Bay Devil Rays (2000–01). At Boston, he was a favorite of star right-hander Roger Clemens. After his firing by the Red Sox, he rejoined Schuerholz with the Atlanta Braves as the Braves' minor league pitching coordinator and pitching coach of Triple-A Richmond (1992–99; 2004–06).\nHe entered the baseball season still active in the game. He rejoined the Royals in 2007 as minor league pitching coordinator and special assistant for player development, and in 2018, as Kansas City's senior pitching advisor, he marked his 69th season in professional baseball. Fischer died on October 30, 2018, at the age of 88."

Beloki held the lead until the fifth stage when he lost it to a teammate but on the sixth stage which was won by Roberto Heras. Beloki lost considerable time to other general classification contenders Óscar Sevilla, Aitor González and Heras. Sevilla took the leader's jersey which he had worn for much of the previous edition of the Vuelta. After the first individual time trial, his teammate Aitor González was within one second of the jersey. On stage 15, González increased the pace of the group and put Sevilla in difficulty. Heras profited from this and attacked to take the stage win and the lead. Heras kept the lead until the final day when there was an individual time trial. Heras started the day with a lead of one minute and eight seconds over González but he lost this in the first 25 km of the time trial. González took the lead and won the Vuelta, Heras came second and Beloki recovered to eventually finish third overall. The Vuelta was also marked by three stage wins of Italian sprinter Mario Cipollini who retired from the race after his third stage win to prepare for the World Championships.\nDuring stage 15 riders climbed the Alto de l'Angliru in rain. Team cars stalled on the steepest part, some unable to restart because their tires slipped on messages painted by fans. Riders were caught behind them and others had to ride with flat tires because mechanics could not reach them. David Millar crashed three times and protested by handing in his race number a metre from the line. The judges ruled he had not finished the stage and he left the race. He regretted his temper – he had been ninth – and apologised to his team."

        "title": "Big Six cricket dispute of 1912",
        "text": "The Big Six cricket dispute of 1912 was a confrontation between the administrators and players of the sport of cricket in Australia. Six of Australia's leading cricketers refused an invitation to tour England for the 1912 Triangular Tournament. The six players were Warwick Armstrong, Vernon Ransford, Victor Trumper, Tibby Cotter, Hanson Carter, and Clem Hill. The dispute was the culmination of a series of arguments that followed the establishment of the Australian Board of Control for International Cricket in 1905. The ramifications of the dispute were far-reaching and affected the destiny of Australian cricket over the ensuing decades.\nCauses.\nThe immediate cause of the dispute was the insistence by the players that they had a right to select the managers of Australian cricket teams touring overseas. However the dispute was a wider one; a power struggle over who would have access to the revenue these tours raised. The players had the support of the South Australian Cricket Association and several unhappy members of Melbourne Cricket Club. The Board was dubbed tyrannical at rowdy public meetings, pamphleteers abounded, and funds were raised to send an independent team, inclusive of the Big Six, to England.\nThe boycott was initially successful in securing the support of public opinion and the performance and antics of the replacement team caused some embarrassment for the Board. Despite this, in the end the Board, supported by Queensland, was able to gain complete control of revenues and appointments for future tours, and the 1912 team went to England without the dissenters. The players were relegated to a subservient role that would not change until the next player rebellion in the 1970s that saw the establishment of World Series Cricket.\nThe 1911–12 Ashes tour against England took place in an environment of hostility between the players and the new Board. Contrary to previous arrangements when the Board was established in 1905, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted rights of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, the group of senior players, \"the Big Six\" threatened to withdraw from the next tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank Laver was appointed.\nEffects.\nMatters came to a head when Clem Hill, the Australian captain and member of the Big Six sent a telegram to fellow selector, Peter McAlister, urging the inclusion of the New South Wales all-rounder Charlie Macartney in the team for the Fourth Test in Melbourne. The reply from McAlister – a member of the Board of Control to Hill's request was \"...Still opposed to Macartney's inclusion. If Iredale (another selector) agrees with you as to Macartney's inclusion, I favour yourself standing down not Minnett.\" At a meeting held after the Test, the Board of Control rejected the players' petition and declared that the manager would be appointed by the Board alone. At a \"special meeting\" two weeks later, the Board appointed George Crouch from Queensland to the position.\nThe following day, 3 February 1912, the selection committee met in Sydney to decide the team for the Fourth Test. It was the first time Hill and McAlister had met since the exchange of telegrams. The pair exchanged insults with McAlister sharply criticising Hill's captaincy. Hill retorted, \"In England, Armstrong wouldn't play under you. Did you ever win any except second rate games?\"\nMcAlister replied, \"I am a better captain than Trumper, Armstrong and yourself put together. You are the worst captain I have ever seen,\" Hill then warned McAlister to stop insulting him, McAlister repeated the remark. Losing control, Hill struck McAlister a blow across the face. The two then grappled for around ten minutes. Blood was drawn, staining their clothes and splashing on the other men present, Iredale and secretary Sydney Smith. At one stage, fearing that one or both combatants would fall through the window and onto the street, Smith grabbed hold of Hill's coat-tails. The fight ended with a bloody McAlister lying on the floor and Hill, unmarked standing over him. Hill told Smith he could no longer work with McAlister and was asked to put his resignation in writing; the Board accepted it that evening.\nWhen the Board announced that George Crouch would be manager of the Australian team for 1912 Triangular Tournament in England, rather than Frank Laver, outright rebellion ensued. Armstrong, Hill, Trumper, Carter, Cotter and Ransford announced that they would be unavailable to join the touring party. The team, under the captaincy of Syd Gregory, left without these players. The tour was not a success on any front: the Australians winning only eight games and losing nine in a wet season and Crouch on return to Australia reported to the Board that \"some of the players had conducted themselves so badly in England as to lead to the team being socially ostracised.\" Nevertheless, as Gideon Haigh has written, \"the deed was done: a national governing body and a species of democracy had been imposed on Australian cricket, although at the cost of reducing its players to serfdom.\""

Coming off the turn, Elliott accelerated and ran past Cruz to take the lead at the bell in 50.58. Hans-Peter Ferner was next behind them, followed by Willi Wülbeck and Rob Druppers. Coming off the third turn, Cruz again accelerated to try to take back the lead. Down the backstretch, Cruz and Elliott ran shoulder to shoulder. Gritting his teeth, Elliott would not concede the position, Cruz running the final turn outside of Elliott still shoulder to shoulder with now Wülbeck watching the battle from two steps behind. Off the final turn, Cruz accelerated again to pull away from Elliott but Wülbeck went around the outside to sprint past both of them, unleaded to victory. Druppers came off the final turn several metres back, passed a fading Ferner and began sprinting, picking off Elliott and then Cruz just before the finish line.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nResults.\nQualifying heats.\nThe qualifying heats took place on 7 August, with the 60 athletes involved being split into 8 heats.

        "text": "Marathon swimming is a class of open water swimming defined by long distances, at least . Unlike marathon foot-races which have a specifically defined distance, \"marathon swims\" vary in distance. However, one commonly used minimum definition is , the distance of the marathon swimming event at the Olympic Games.\nAs in all open water swimming, tides, surface currents, and wind-chop are major determinants of finish-times. For a given course, these factors can vary dramatically from day to day, making any attempt to draw conclusions about athletic ability by comparing finish times from performances undertaken on different days meaningless.\nOne of the earliest marathon swims was accomplished in 1875 by Captain Matthew Webb, when he became the first person to swim across the English Channel. Similarly, perhaps the most famous marathon swim of all time was accomplished in 1926 by Gertrude Ederle, when she became, at 19 years of age, the first woman to swim across the English Channel. In doing so, she demolished the existing world record for the crossing, by employing the crawl stroke technique.\nThe Triple Crown of Open Water Swimming includes three of the best-known marathon swims: (1) across the English Channel, (2) between Catalina Island and the mainland in Southern California, USA, and (3) around Manhattan Island in New York City, USA.\nThe Ocean's seven is a collection of seven channel swims: (1) North Channel between Ireland and Scotland, (2) Cook Strait between the North and South Islands of New Zealand, (3) Molokai Channel between Oahu and Molokai Islands in Hawaii, (4) English Channel between England and France, (5) Catalina Channel between Santa Catalina Island and Southern California, (6) Tsugaru Strait between the islands of Honshu and Hokkaido in Japan, and (7) Strait of Gibraltar between Europe and Africa. Irish swimmer Steve Redmond became the first person to complete the Ocean's seven upon completing the Tsugaru Strait on May 15, 2012."

Among the 16 were four factory-team Type 51s driven by the Monegasque Louis Chiron, the Italian Achille Varzi and the French Albert Divo and Guy Bouriat. The real challenge came from the Maserati 8C 2500's driven by René Dreyfus, the Italian Luigi Fagioli and Clemente Bondietti. Rudolf Caracciola with his huge Mercedes SSKL (Super Sport Short Light-Weight) was uncompetitive as his larger car performed poorly around the tight Monaco track.\nThe race was between the blue cars from Molsheim and the red ones from Modena. When the start flag dropped it was Rene Dreyfus in his red Maserati who led into St. Devote, only to be passed by 'Williams' on the hill to the Casino, but his lead was short-lived as the Brit was sidelined by a broken valve spring, and his race was over. Achille Varzi and Caracciola started closing on Dreyfus and Varzi managed to overtake the Frenchman on the 7th lap. Caracciola struggled with a slipping clutch that gave in on lap 53.\nStarting slowly, Louis Chiron eventually displayed his talents; gaining back ground with a new lap record time. He caught up with all his opponents and left them behind. Chiron, a native of Monaco, finished the race some 5 minutes ahead of Luigi Fagioli.\nJean Bugatti could not control his joy and jumped over the parapet of the bleachers and fell into Louis Chiron's arms. For the Monegasque, this Monaco Grand Prix victory really confirmed his reputation.\nStarting grid.\nNote: grid slots were determined by drawing lots (Birkin and Ivanowski had provisionally been due to start on the first and seventh row, respectively)."

        "text": "The Altenberg bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track is a venue in Germany for bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton. Located in Saxony in eastern Germany, it is northwest of Altenberg, near the border with the Czech Republic.\nHistory.\nAltenberg raced bobsleigh as early as 1908 on a natural track going downhill. By the late 1970s, the East Germans were already successful in luge, and had increasing success in bobsleigh. This included a total of six Winter Olympic medals in bobsleigh in 1976 and 1980, along with five world bobsleigh championship medals between 1977 and 1979. In order to increase East Germany's effort to win more bobsleigh and luge medals both at the Winter Olympics and their respective sport's world championships, a track was constructed. The track at Altenberg was constructed under the order of then-Stasi (Ministry for State Security in East Germany) Minister Erich Mielke.\nConstruction began in 1981 under restrictive access with a wire fence and armed patrols from the Landstreitkräfte (East German National People's Army) on orders from Mielke. By 1983, construction was completed though trials were less than successful. This would result in turns 11 and 12 being destroyed and rebuilt. It was not until late 1986 when the track was officially completed with homologation received from both the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation (FIBT) and the International Luge Federation (FIL) the following year. The track was part of the training used by SG Dynamo Zinnwald/ SV Dynamo until the 1990 German reunification. Men's skeleton first competed in 1992.\nIn 1997, the women's single luge start house was created before turn three after being shared with the men's double luge start house before turn seven from 1989 to 1996. Women's skeleton first began competition in 1999 while women's bobsleigh first started the following year. An 18th curve was modified during the summer of 2007 with the addition of a finish curve and straightaway.\nOver the weekend of 1–3 February 2008, the track hosted the 200th FIL Luge World Cup event, which began in December 1977. The track was awarded the 2012 FIL World Luge Championships at the 2008 FIL Congress in Calgary, Canada, on 28 June of that year, following Whistler's bid withdrawal. Refurbishment of the track for the 2012 World Luge Championships was projected to cost €1.4 million, which included modernizing the electronics and refrigeration system and renovation of the women's and junior start houses.\nTrack technical details.\nThe track is powered by four refrigeration condensers each with a capacity which combined can keep the track frozen at ambient conditions up to . Its storage tanks hold up to of ammonia, generating the equivalent of 12,000 household refrigerators. There a total of fifty sensors located throughout the track with its staff contacted at a moment's notice if anything bad occurs. Monitoring is done by closed-circuit television to further enhance track security The icing of the track starts in October, taking eight workers one week to evenly ice the track to a layer of at a temperature of .\nStatistics.\nThe vertical drop is from the bobsleigh start, with a maximum grade of 15% and an average grade of 8.66%. The elevation at the base is above sea level.\nTurns 1, 2, 11–14, and 18 have no names listed in the track diagram. Turn 18 is followed by a \"Bremshang\", a finish/braking straight."

        "text": "The 1995 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament featured 64 teams. The Final Four consisted of Connecticut, Tennessee, Stanford, and Georgia. Connecticut defeated Tennessee 70–64 to win its first NCAA title and complete a 35–0 undefeated season.\nThe first two rounds were held at the home court of the top four seeds in each region (except for San Diego State, which hosted three games in the West region). The regional semifinals and finals were held at the University of Connecticut for the East region, UCLA for the West region, the University of Tennessee for the Mideast region, and Drake University for the Midwest region. The Final Four was played in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nNotable events.\nIn a second-round game, 4 seed Alabama faced the 5 seed Duke. The game was close throughout the contest, with neither team leading the other by more than seven points. With time winding down in regulation, Alabama's Niesa Johnson hit a three-pointer to send the game to overtime. Not just one overtime, the game would eventually feature four overtimes. Johnson went on to hit two free throws at the end of the fourth overtime to give Alabama a 121–120 victory, setting records for the most overtimes, and the most points scored in an NCAA tournament game. At the time, it was called \"the best women's basketball game in history\".\nIn the east regional semi-final involving Louisiana Tech and Virginia, confusion reigned momentarily with both teams celebrating at the end of regulation. Louisiana Tech led early, with as much as a 13-point lead in the first half and a ten-point lead at halftime. The Cavaliers came back and had a 63–62 lead with seconds left in the game. With time running out, Louisiana Tech's Debra Williams went to the foul line for a one-and-one shot. She missed it, but the scorekeeper accidentally recorded it, so the scoreboard showed 63–63. Louisiana Tech tried and missed a last second shot, but thought they were headed to overtime based upon the score, while Virginia thought they had won, so both teams were celebrating. The referees met at the scores table to sort it out, then Dee Kantner emerged and pointed to the Virginia bench signaling victory.\nGeorgia and Tennessee, both from the SEC, squared off in one of the Final Four match ups. Tennessee was a number 1 seed, while Georgia was a 3 seed, and upset top seed Colorado 82–79 in the Midwest Rational final. The two teams had faced each other in the final game of the regular season, when the Lady Vols beat the Lady Bulldogs by 22 points. Georgia coach Andy Landers complained about lack of effort in that game, but did not have the same complaints in the Final Four game, even though the final margin was identical. Tennessee's Pat Summitt emphasizes rebounds, and Tennessee out rebounded Georgia 51–33. While the Lady Bulldogs were able to get within seven points in the second half, they could get no closer and Tennessee prevailed 73–51, to send them into the champions ship game.\nDespite entering the game against Stanford with an undefeated record, some skeptics weren't convinced that Connecticut could win. Although UConn had beaten Tennessee earlier in the year, they then played in the Big East, which at the time wasn't a strong conference. The Big East earned just two invitations to the NCAA tournament, while eight other conferences had three or more teams in the tournament. Stanford was a representative of the Pacific-10 conference, which had five teams strong enough to earn bids. However, the Huskies jumped out to an early 16–4 lead, and ended the game with a 27-point margin, winning 87–60. Kara Wolters scored 31 points, a single point under her career high while Jamelle Elliott matched her career high with 21 points. Consensus national player of the year Rebecca Lobo added 17 points, prompting coach Auriemma to quip \"The reason we're playing [in the final] is I've got these three players [and Tara VanDerveer doesn't.]\"\nIn the championship game, Tennessee had a small lead in the first half 28–25, but more importantly, two of UConn's All-Americans, Jennifer Rizzotti and Rebecca Lobo, had three fouls, while six foot seven inch Kara Wolters had two. Auriemma tried playing small, with six foot Jamelle Elliott the tallest Husky on the floor. The Tennessee lead extended, but only to six points at the half. In the second half, the lead was still four points in the Lady Vols favor when Wolters received her fourth foul. With twelve minutes left to go in the game, Lobo had but six points. Lobo then scored on four possessions, and with a steal by Rizzotti turned into a layup, the Tennessee nine point lead was down to a single point, prompting coach Summitt to call for a time-out. Jamelle Elliott tied the game with just over two minutes left, then Rizzotti made a play which would be talked about for years afterward. She grabbed a rebound, then drove the length of the court against Michelle M. Marciniak. Just before reaching the basket, she executed a cross-over dribble and sank a left-handed layup to take a lead that would never be relinquished. UConn won the game 70–64, completing the first undefeated season in NCAA history since the 1986 Texas team, and winning the first national championship for the Connecticut Huskies team.\nQualifying teams – automatic.\nSixty-four teams were selected to participate in the 1995 NCAA Tournament. Thirty-two conferences were eligible for an automatic bid to the 1995 NCAA Tournament .\nQualifying teams – at-large.\nThirty-two additional teams were selected to complete the six-four invitations.\nBids by conference.\nThirty-two conferences earned an automatic bid. In seventeen cases, the automatic bid was the only representative from the conference. Thirty-two additional at-large teams were selected from fifteen of the conferences.\nFirst and second rounds.\nIn 1995, the field remained at 64 teams. The teams were seeded, and assigned to four geographic regions, with seeds 1–16 in each region. In Round 1, seeds 1 and 16 faced each other, as well as seeds 2 and 15, seeds 3 and 14, seeds 4 and 13, seeds 5 and 12, seeds 6 and 11, seeds 7 and 10, and seeds 8 and 9. In the first two rounds, the top four seeds were given the opportunity to host the first-round game. In most cases, the higher seed accepted the opportunity. The exception:\nThe following table lists the region, host school, venue and the sixteen first and second round locations:\nRegionals and Final Four.\nThe Regionals, named for the general location, were held from March 23 to March 25 at these sites:\nEach regional winner advanced to the Final Four held April 1 and April 2 in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Target Center,\nBids by state.\nThe sixty-four teams came from thirty-three states, plus Washington, D.C.

        "text": "Paul Michael Mitchell Jr. (born August 19, 1949) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played from 1975 to 1980 for the Baltimore Orioles, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners and Milwaukee Brewers.\nAmateur career.\nBorn in Worcester, Massachusetts, Mitchell graduated from Worcester Academy in 1968 and was selected by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 18th round of the 1968 MLB draft. Rather than turn professional, he opted to attend Old Dominion University on a baseball scholarship. From 1969-71 he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL) for the Falmouth Commodores, leading Falmouth to the league championship in all three years and being named the league's outstanding pitcher in 1969 and 1970. Mitchell was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the 1st round (7th overall) of the secondary phase of the 1971 MLB draft. \nProfessional career.\nMitchell spent the 1972 season with the Double-A Asheville Orioles, and 1973-74 with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings.\nHe made his MLB debut for Baltimore on July 1, 1975, at Fenway Park against the Boston Red Sox and finished the season with a 3-0 record and a 3.63 earned run average in 11 games. In January of 1976, Jim Henneman of \"The Sporting News\" wrote that due to young pitchers \"like Paul Mitchell and Mike Flanagan...the Orioles would no doubt be willing to sacrifice a pitcher with [Mike] Torrez's ability if it meant getting [Reggie] Jackson in return.\" Sure enough, the Orioles did trade Torrez to the Oakland Athletics for Jackson on April 2, but they included Mitchell in the deal. Don Baylor was the third player sent over from Baltimore, and in addition to Jackson, the Orioles also acquired Ken Holtzman and minor-league right-handed pitcher Bill Van Bommel. \nMitchell posted a 9-7 record for Oakland in 1976 but struggled early in 1977 and was dealt mid-season to the Seattle Mariners, who had joined the American League as an expansion team for the 1977 season. In 1978, Mitchell led Seattle pitchers in wins, posting an 8-14 record for a Mariners team that lost 104 games. In 1979, Seattle traded Mitchell to the Milwaukee Brewers in exchange for Randy Stein. Mitchell made his final appearance with Milwaukee on September 21, 1980, against Seattle and was released prior to the 1981 season.\nIn all, Mitchell pitched in six major league seasons, recording a career win–loss record of 32–39 in 162 appearances. He is tied with four others for the all-time major league career record for fielding percentage among pitchers who have at least 500 innings pitched. In 621.1 innings of work, Mitchell handled 114 chances, recording 32 putouts and 82 assists without a single error, for a perfect career fielding percentage of 1.000. \nIn 2002, Mitchell was inducted into the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame, and in 2011 he served as honorary captain of the West Division team at the CCBL All-Star Game at Fenway Park."

        "title": "2008 Bowling Green Falcons football team",
        "text": "The 2008 Bowling Green Falcons football team represented Bowling Green State University during the 2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season. The team's head football coach was Gregg Brandon. The Falcons played their home games at Doyt Perry Stadium in Bowling Green, Ohio. They were a member of the East Division of the Mid-American Conference. They finished the season 6–6, 4–4 in MAC play to finish in a tie for second place in the East Division. Despite being bowl eligible, they were not selected to participate in a bowl game.\nPreseason.\nShortly after the 2007 season, the Falcons lost backup quarterback, Anthony Glaud and wide receiver, Zach Charles to transfer as the pair made their way to defending MEAC champion Delaware State, because of lack of playing time. On May 12, the Football Writers Association of America announced that Bowling Green senior defensive lineman Diyral Briggs was placed on their watch list for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy, awarded to the nation's top defensive player. At the MAC football media day, the Falcons were voted as the preseason favorites to win the East Division crown, garnering 17 first place votes and 206 total votes, just edging out rival, Miami (OH) who had 7 first place votes and 202 total votes.\nCoaching staff.\nThe Bowling Green Falcons have seen numerous changes in the coaching staff. Offensive Coordinator Mick McCall left the team to take the same position at Northwestern, while former Buffalo head coach, Jim Hofher, was named quarterbacks coach, Troy Rothenbuhler was named passing game coordinator, Matt Campbell was named running game coordinator, and Doug Phillips was named recruiting coordinator.\nGame summaries.\nPittsburgh.\nThe Falcons opened the 2008 campaign against nationally ranked Pitt at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in front of 45,063 and a national television audience on ESPNU. The Falcons came in as 13-point underdogs against the Panthers, who had previously been 25-2 against the MAC and 24-0 at home against the conference. Pittsburgh showed their poise early on in the game scoring on their first offensive drive of the game with an 11-yard run by running back LeSean McCoy to cap off an eight play, 71-yard drive that took less than four minutes to complete. Pitt would extend their lead in the early in the second quarter with 4 yard touchdown pass to Derek Kinder from quarterback Bill Stull, making the score 14–0 in favor of Pitt. The Falcons would answer back against the Panthers on the following possession, marching down the field 73 yards in eight plays, capped off with a five-yard pass to Jimmy Scheidler from wide receiver Freddie Barnes, cutting Pitt's lead to 14–7. Scheidler would bring in his second touchdown reception of the game six and a half minutes later on a three-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tyler Sheehan, which tied the game at 14–14. Pitt would answer back on the following possession as their Lou Groza Award candidate kicker Connor Lee booted 36 yard field goal as time expired in the first half, giving Pitt the halftime lead 17–14.\nThe game would become a story of two halves as the Falcons came out and as the Falcons defense slowed down the powerhouse McCoy and forced Pitt to two fumbles and an interception. Bowling Green would take their first lead of the game with an 8-yard run by wide receiver Anthony Turner with 3:53 left in the third quarter. The preceding extra point was blocked by Pitt and the Falcons took the lead of 20–14. Early in the fourth quarter the Bowling Green defense caused Pitt's third fumble and seemed to return it to the end zone for an apparent game-winning touchdown, but due to an inadvertent whistle, Bowling Green was stripped of the touchdown, but still took over possession of the ball at Pitt's 11-yard line. The Falcons would make good on their field position scoring on an 11-yard run on a quarterback draw by Sheehan which increased the Falcons' lead to 27–17. Pitt continued to attempt to mount a comeback but after Lee's missed field goal of 42 yards at 3:58 left in the fourth quarter blew the wind out of Pitt's sails and Stull being intercepted in the end zone by Kenny Lewis with 1:26 left in the game officially put Pitt away. The Falcons improved to 1–0 on the season and had their second consecutive season opening victory over a BCS Conference opponent (having defeated Minnesota 32–31 in overtime the year before), although being outgained by the Pitt offense 393–254. Sheehan lead the Falcons in the passing game completing 24 of 40 attempts for 163 yards, 1 touchdown, and an interception, followed by Barnes who was 2 of 2 for 27 yards and a touchdown. The Falcons' running game was led by Chris Bullock who had 7 rushes for 44 yards, followed by Turner and Sheehan who each had a rushing touchdown. Bullock also led the receivers with 7 receptions for 49 yards along with Scheidler who had 3 receptions for 30 yards and two touchdowns. Jamal Brown led the Falcons defense with 14 tackles, followed by Antonio Smith's 12. Smith, Lewis, and Enrique Dozier each forced fumbles, with Lewis, Dozier, and Angelo Magnone each recovering a fumble and Lewis snagging the lone interception for the Falcons defense. The Falcons were able to sack Stull four times, twice by Bronko Nagurski Trophy candidate Diyral Briggs and once each by Smith and Dozier."

Television coverage of Winter X Games XII was broadcast on ESPN and ABC, primarily hosted by Sal Masekela and Todd Harris. Final attendance for the four-day event was 72,500.\nDisciplines.\nDisciplines at the 12th Winter X Games were:\nHighlights.\nSkier Tanner Hall won his third consecutive men's superpipe gold medal and his seventh X Games gold medal over all, the most of any winter competitor. This record stood alone until the final night of competition, when Shaun White tied it with a gold medal in the men's snowboard superpipe and set his own record with 12 career Winter X Games medals.\nSnowmobile Speed and Style was debuted as a new event on the opening night of competition, combining traditional snocross, a timed race, with trick skill. The event was judged, with completion time and freestyle each making up half of the final score. Levi LaVallee won gold. Tucker Hibbert won his third gold medal in Snocross and his second consecutive. LaVallee's subsequent gold medal win in the snowmobile freestyle made him only the second Winter X Games competitor to win a gold medal in four different events, after Shaun Palmer.\nIn women's snowboarding, Lindsay Jacobellis regained the gold medal, her fourth, in Women's Snowboard Cross, defeating Swiss boarder Tanja Frieden. Frieden defeated Jacobellis at the 2006 Winter Olympics after Jacobellis fell near the finish line after attempting a trick. Aspen native Gretchen Bleiler won the women's superpipe, defeating the Australian Torah Bright.\nBig Air events returned to the Winter X Games for the first time in several competitions. There were only four participants in both the skiing and snowboarding big air events. The events were done in a knockout format, with two judges voting and the audience, voting through text messaging, each having equal say as to who advanced to the finals and who won. There were only gold medals awarded for the Big Air events, as they were judged as winner take all competition.\nOn the final day of competition, the weather deteriorated throughout the day The weather likely affected the turnout, with around 4,000 fewer spectators than Winter X Games XI. The ski cross course was affected by weather conditions as the day went on, and there were several major crashes involving top competitors. Lars Lewen, Juha Haukkala, and Karin Huttary all had to be taken to the hospital following injuries; Enak Gavaggio was involved in the same crash as Lewen, but refused transport. American Daron Rahlves, a three time Olympian, won the gold in the men's event, his first X Games medal. Errol Kerr, who had the fastest time of the day in any heat, did not medal. Sarah Burke defended her gold medal in the women's ski superpipe competition, defeating Swiss ex-snowboarder Mirjam Jaeger.\nResults.\nSkiing.\nMen's Monoski Cross\nMen's Ski Big Air\nMen's Ski Cross\nWomen's Ski Cross\nMen's Ski Slopestyle\nMen's Ski SuperPipe\nWomen's Ski SuperPipe\nSnowboarding.\nMen's Snowboard Big Air\nMen's Snowboard Cross\nWomen's Snowboard Cross\nMen's Snowboard Slopestyle\nWomen's Snowboard Slopestyle\nMen's Snowboard SuperPipe\nWomen's Snowboard SuperPipe\nSnowmobiling.\nSnocross \nSnowmobile Freestyle\nSnowmobile Speed and Style "

        "text": "Thomas Clyde Bowling Jr. (January 18, 1953 – March 21, 2015) was an American convicted murderer who unsuccessfully challenged the constitutionality of his death sentence.\nBowling was convicted and sentenced to death for the April 9, 1990, murders of Tina and Eddie Earley. Bowling shot the Earleys dead after ramming their car outside their small dry-cleaning business in the city of Lexington, Kentucky. Bowling also shot the couple's two-year-old son, but the child survived. Thomas Bowling was arrested on April 11, in neighboring Tennessee. His car and a .357 calibre handgun were found hidden at his family's home in rural Kentucky.\nBowling's attorneys pursued appeals and clemency on the grounds of potential innocence and mental retardation. Bowling died of cancer at the prisons nursing facility, aged 62.\nAppeal.\nBowling's lawyers claim the evidence against him is purely circumstantial, and there are other suspects for the murder. Bowling was assessed at the age of 12 - 13 to have an IQ of 74 which, given the margin of error, placed him within the range for mental retardation. In addition, he had a documented history of adaptive deficits, being described as a \"follower\" and easily manipulated. Throughout school, his parents had to lay his clothes out for him and ensure that he bathed and maintained personal hygiene. Bowling was a slow learner throughout school; He spent three years in the ninth grade, and failed health class three years in a row.\nBowling's lawyers also argue that there was no physical evidence placing him at the scene of the crime; an eye-witness failed to identify him; ballistics experts admitted the weapon linked to him was one of millions that could have been used in the crime; and while the car used in the crime was his, there was no proof that he was driving it at the time. Further, the state did not establish a motive for Thomas Bowling to kill the Earley couple, whom he did not know and had never met.\nThe lawyers assert that a local family murdered the Earleys. According to the petition and accompanying police reports, Eddie Earley told police about a local Lexington family's alleged drug activity, which resulted in an arrest. The family then had a motive for a shooting. Bowling's lawyers argue that the family apparently used Bowling's vehicle in the murder. On the day of the murders, Bowling was intoxicated and states that he cannot remember anything of that day. Apparently, however, he was told by members of the above family later that afternoon to take his car out of town.\nSupreme Court.\nIn 2004 Bowling sued the Kentucky State Department of Corrections along with fellow inmate Ralph Baze on the grounds that execution by lethal injection constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Baze's court case was \"Baze v. Rees\". On April 16, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court, by a 7–2 vote, rejected the challenge to the use of lethal injections to execute prisoners."

        "title": "2010 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 33rd America's Cup between Société Nautique de Genève defending with team Alinghi against Golden Gate Yacht Club, and their racing team BMW Oracle Racing was the subject of extensive court action and litigation, surpassing in acrimony even the controversial 1988 America's Cup. Since the two parties were unable to agree otherwise, the match took place as a one-on-one deed of gift match in gigantic, specialized multi-hull racing yachts with no other clubs or teams participating. The Golden Gate Yacht Club swept the two races as their yacht \"USA 17\" powered by a rigid wing-sail proved to be significantly faster than Société Nautique de Genève's yacht \"Alinghi 5\". The litigation leading up to the match included which club would be the challenger, the dates and venue for the regattas, certain rules governing the regattas (in particular the measurement rules), and the construction of the boats.\nThe Americans won back the Cup after they last lost it in 1995.\nWhen Société Nautique de Genève (SNG) successfully defended the trophy in the 32nd America's Cup, they immediately accepted a challenge from Club Náutico Español de Vela (CNEV) a Spanish organization formed expressly for the purpose of challenging for the cup and keeping the regatta in Valencia. When SNG and CNEV published their protocol for the 33rd America's Cup challenge, there was widespread consternation over its terms, with some teams and yacht clubs calling it the worst protocol in the history of the event.\nThe Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC) filed its own challenge for the Cup and then filed a court case asking that CNEV be removed as Challenger of Record as being unqualified under the Deed of Gift. GGYC also asked that it be named as the rightful Challenger of Record, being the first club to file a conforming challenge. There followed a long and acrimonious legal battle, with the New York Court of Appeals finally deciding on April 2, 2009, that CNEV did not qualify as valid challenger, and that the GGYC was thus the rightful Challenger of Record.\nDisputes.\nRegarding the Challenger of Record.\nFollowing its successful defense of the Cup on July 3, 2007, Société Nautique de Genève (SNG) accepted a challenge for the 33rd America's Cup from Club Náutico Español de Vela (CNEV), a newly formed yacht club, created for the purpose of challenging for the Cup. CNEV had no boats, no clubhouse, only four members (vice presidents of the Spanish Sailing Federation), and had never run a regatta of any type. On July 5, 2007 SNG and CNEV released the protocols for the next Cup regatta. The protocol was the subject of much criticism, with some teams and yacht clubs calling it the worst protocol in the history of the event.\nThe Golden Gate Yacht Club (GGYC) initiated legal action against SNG in the New York Supreme Court (the court of first instance) alleging violations of the Deed of Gift of the America's Cup. (New York courts decide disputes regarding the terms of the Deed of Gift because the America's Cup is held under the terms of a charitable legal trust established under New York law). The suit alleged that CNEV did not meet the terms of the Deed of Gift as a legitimate yacht club that would qualify to be the challenger of record, in particular because it had never held an annual regatta, which, according to GGYC, was a requirement under the Deed of Gift. At the same time, GGYC issued a challenge for the Cup.\nBecause of the precedent set in the 1988 America's Cup where the San Diego Yacht Club defended against a monohull yacht with a catamaran, any non mutual-consent challenger must specify the largest multi-hull possible under the terms of the Deed of Gift, if it is to have any chance of winning. Consequently, GGYC specified its yacht as having a 90-ft length-waterline, and 90-ft beam. However, GGYC also stated that they wanted \"consensual negotiations in the spirit of the Deed of Gift toward a Protocol comparable in scope, and similar in terms, to that used for the 32nd America's Cup.\"\nAs the legal proceedings progressed, SNG continued to work with the other teams on the protocol, and by December 2007 twelve challengers had met the entry deadline and were preparing to race in a multi-challenge 33rd America's Cup. But despite extensive negotiations and proposals made by both sides, GGYC and SNG were unable to agree upon a mutual consent Protocol.\nThe lawsuit therefore continued and the court ruled in favor of GGYC on November 27, 2007, holding that CNEV was not a valid challenger, and declaring GGYC the proper and legal challenger. SNG was instructed to meet GGYC's challenge under the Deed of Gift terms unless they could agree on other terms by mutual consent. This order was confirmed on March 13, 2008\nSNG appealed the decision against CNEV, and on July 29, 2008, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court 2008 reversed the lower court ruling in a 3–2 decision. The lower court had ruled in favor of GGYC because CNEV had not held an annual regatta when it filed its challenge for the Cup. But the Appellate Division ruled that the phrase \"having for its annual regatta,\" as used in the Deed of Gift, is ambiguous. Therefore, CNEV could satisfy the requirement by \"intend[ing] to hold an annual regatta and do[ing] so prior to the date of its proposed match.\"\nPending the outcome of the litigation, SNG had set a deadline of December 15, 2008 for entries in the 33rd America's Cup regatta. On December 8, 2008 GGYC sent a letter to SNG to inform them that GGYC would not submit an entry since it did not consider SNG's regatta \"a legitimate America's Cup\" and vowed to focus on winning the legal case in the New York Court of Appeals.\nA number of organizations submitted \"amicus curiae\" briefs to the court. In particular, on December 31, 2008, the New York Yacht Club (NYYC), the oldest and longest holder of the America's Cup, filed a brief supporting GGYC's position.\nOn April 2, 2009, the New York Court of Appeals in Albany, New York (the court of last instance) decided 6–0 in favor of GGYC, holding that a yacht club could not qualify as challenger unless it had held at least one annual regatta prior to its challenge.\nRegarding the dates and the venue.\nAfter the April 2009 ruling GGYC said it would \"immediately seek to negotiate with the Defender for a conventional, multi-challenger America's Cup in monohulls.\" However SNG indicated that they would not negotiate for a multi-challenger regatta and would fall back to a default Deed of Gift match, that is three races over a 40- (first and third race) or 39-nautical mile (second race) course between GGYC's trimaran \"BMW Oracle Racing 90\" and SNG's catamaran \"Alinghi 5\". Indeed, despite various calls for negotiation, it had been apparent for some time that the provisions of the Deed of Gift would likely govern the match, and, further, that the parties did not agree on the interpretation of certain provisions of the Deed of Gift or of the court decision.\nIn March 2008, the parties had attempted to agree on dates for the races. SNG took the position that it was entitled to a 10-month period to prepare for the race and, because it was based in the Northern Hemisphere, the races could not take place until May 2009. GGYC took the position that the 10-month notice period should run from the November 2007, when the court of first instance ruled that CNEV was not a valid challenger, so the races should take place in October 2008. Despite various attempts, the parties were unable to agree on the dates and on May 12, 2008, the New York Supreme Court issued an order setting the date at 10 months after that date. The 10-month delay was held to have been suspended during the appeals process and was reinstated by the final April 2, 2009 decision of the New York Court of Appeals. However, SNG refused to accept a race in February 2010, arguing again that the deed did not permit racing in the Northern Hemisphere until May. GGYC forced a court session and, on May 14, 2009, the court ruled from the bench that the race must take place in February 2010, unless another date was mutually agreed to.\nThough the date was now set, dispute persisted regarding the venue. SNG argued that the April 2, 2009 court decision specifying \"that the location of the match shall be in Valencia, Spain or any other location selected by SNG, provided SNG notify GGYC in writing not less than six months in advance of the date set for the first challenge match race of the location it has selected for the challenge match races,\" allowed it to choose a venue in the Northern Hemisphere. GGYC maintained that without mutual consent, the defender must specify a deed-legal venue, which in February would mean the Southern Hemisphere. Under the terms of the Court order, if SNG did not specify a venue six months before the match, the venue would default to Valencia.\nIn August 2009 SNG announced that the event would be based in the Northern Hemisphere at Al Hamra Village in the Ras al-Khaimah emirate of the United Arab Emirates.\nGGYC immediately replied that Ras al-Khaimah was not a Deed Legal Venue. SNG maintained its position. GGYC filed a motion in court to request \"that the Court issue an Order directing that the 33rd America's Cup be held in Valencia, Spain, in February 2010, unless the parties mutually consent otherwise.\" According to GGYC, Valencia was mentioned in the April 2 court order as an exception, because both parties had indicated that they agreed to Valencia. Unless GGYC agreed to some other location in the Northern Hemisphere, the race must take place in the Southern Hemisphere, because the venue must comply with the Deed of Gift. Indeed, said GGYC, the expression \"or any other location\" in the April 2 court order could not be interpreted literally, because it could not extend to a venue like the Colorado River or Walden Pond. Given that the literal meaning could not apply, the order must be interpreted consistent with the Deed of Gift.\nOn October 27, 2009, Justice Shirley Kornreich ruled from the bench that Ras al-Khaimah, United Arab Emirates was not a deed legal venue and that the race must take place either in Valencia or in a Southern Hemisphere venue. In early November, SNG wrote to the court stating that it would hold the race in February in Valencia, Spain., and at the same time, they appealed the decision to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court. The appeal was denied on December 15, 2009.\nRegarding the rules of the match.\nOn July 14, 2009, GGYC filed a motion with the court asking that SNG be found in contempt for changing the rules for the match in secret to allow them to build a boat with powered winches and moveable ballast which were allegedly illegal under the SNG rules that should apply to the race. SNG filed a competing motion asking that GGYC be disqualified as a challenger if they did not produce a Custom House Certificate for their challenging yacht within 14 days, and it disputed the allegations made by GGYC, arguing that the use of powered winches and moveable ballast was common for high performance catamarans racing under SNG's rules, and that the April 2009 version of the SNG rules should apply, since it was only on that date that GGYC was recognized as Challenger of Record.\nOn July 29, 2009, the court issued its decision regarding these matters. The court refused to hold Alinghi in contempt. The court ruled that the Deed of Gift does not specify any restrictions on the construction of the yachts. Provided that the boats are propelled by sails, auxiliary power can be used for winches etc. Moveable ballast can also be used. Thus Alinghi prevailed on those points. The court also ordered a hearing in order to determine the date on which GGYC could reasonably be compelled to produce the Custom House Certificate for its yacht. On September 2, 2009, GGYC filed an appeal against this decision.\nOn September 18, 2009, pursuant to its July 29, 2009, decision and following the hearing arising from that decision, the court ruled that the design and construction of the challenger's vessel was not frozen at the time of the challenge. Thus GGYC could continue to modify and to develop its yacht. The Custom House Registry referred to in the Deed of Gift (now called a Certificate of Documentation-COD) had to be delivered two weeks prior to the first race. The Court stated: \"It is not only advances in technology, but the unsportsmanlike behavior of Golden Gate that has resulted in substantially reducing SNG's advantage as originally contemplated by the Deed. Nonetheless, Golden Gate's actions are not contrary to law or sanctionable in this limited forum.\"\nOn August 6, 2009, SNG sent a letter to GGYC, containing the measurement procedures for the yachts. GGYC did not accept these procedures, in particular because the SNG procedure would include the rudders in the LWL measurement and thus result in GGYC's boat \"BMW Oracle Racing 90\" being disqualified. GGYC requested the court to declare that the measurement procedure proposed by SNG was not valid (in particular the rudders should not be included when measuring length on the load waterline). SNG maintained its position. On October 30, 2009, the court ruled that the rudders should not be included for the measurement of the Load Water Line Length (GGYC's position). SNG appealed that ruling, but the appeal was denied on December 15, 2009.\nGGYC also argued that the rules that should apply to the race must be the SNG rules that were in force when GGYC filed its challenge. Otherwise, said GGYC, SNG could arbitrarily change the rules so as to make it impossible for the challenger to win. For example, said GGYC, the modified rules could specify that the challenger would have to race while dragging an anchor. According to GGYC, it did not make sense to envisage that the rules could be changed after the challenge was issued, since the challenger based its challenge on SNG's rules at the time of the challenge. GGYC also challenged certain provisions of the agreement between ISAF and SNG, in particular concerning the powers of the jury.\nBut on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich declined to approve a renew and re-argue of her July 29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but she said that the decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November 19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the jury would soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.&lt;ref name=\"NYSC602446/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn December 4, 2009, it was announced that the international jury had been named.\nThe Notice of Race that was published on November 10, 2009, specified, among other things, that the races would not take place if the wind exceeded or the waves were taller than 1 meter. A draft amended Notice of Race and draft Sailing instructions were published on January 8, 2010. The final versions were published on January 19, 2010. These were immediately challenged by GGYC, who alleged that SNG had inappropriately re-inserted Racing Rule 53 (\"Skin Friction\"); set the starting time for the races despite the Deed of Gift's requirement that this be agreed by mutual consent; set wind and wave limits to favor its own yacht; changed the latest draft of the Notice of Race to ban certain wind detection equipment now being used by GGYC's yacht and permitted under all earlier drafts of the Notice of Race; inappropriately re-arranged the hierarchy of the applicable rules so that the Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions would, in the case of\nconflict, overrule the Racing Rules of Sailing. GGYC requested that the International Jury be convened as soon as possible to negate or revise the biased provisions before the races. GGYC subsequently requested that the International Jury also consider certain issues related to the measurement rules. On February 2, 2010, the International Jury rejected GGYC's requests for redress regarding the measurement procedure. The jury held that the maximum amount of moveable ballast had to be on board when the boat was measured and that it had to be equally distributed laterally, but that no other restrictions would apply. On the same date, the Jury decided that SNG, as organizing authority, did have the right to set the start time; that the Race Officer would have the discretion to determine whether weather conditions on any given day were safe and fair so that racing could take place; and that GGYC's wind detection equipment was allowed. It ordered the Notice of Race to be modified to make it clear that the Deed of Gift took precedence and that the Notice of Race and Sailing Instructions could not override the Racing Rules of Sailing.\nOn January 28, 2010, GGYC announced that it had requested that the International Jury allow it to employ a friction-reduction system that involved discharging liquids in the water. GGYC stated that friction-reduction systems had been explicitly allowed at SNG's request, so it was not appropriate for SNG to attempt to restrict such systems. According to SNG, the discharge of liquids by GGYC's yacht would violate reasonable environmental protection measures incorporated in the Sailing Instructions. On February 2, 2010, the International Jury decided that friction-reduction systems would be allowed provided that applicable environmental laws were not violated.\nRegarding the construction of the boats.\nOn December 22, 2009, GGYC sent a letter to SNG expressing concern about SNG's apparent interpretation of the \"constructed in country\" provisions of the Deed of Gift. According to GGYC, it appeared that SNG's team intended to use sails constructed in Minden, Nevada, USA, and that this would constitute a direct infringement of the clear terms of the Deed of Gift. GGYC requested that SNG clarify the matter within five days.\nThe following day, SNG stated publicly that GGYC's accusations were incorrect: \"\"Alinghi 5\" complies with the Deed of Gift 'constructed in country' requirement, it was built in Switzerland and so are its sails.\" On December 28, 2009, SNG sent a letter to GGYC stating that \"the Deed only requires the 'yacht or vessel' to be constructed in the respective country and does not expressly impose obligations in respect of any of the separate components on board the yacht or vessel\" and further stated that, while they would be willing to meet to discuss any concerns, the issue appeared to be theoretical until SNG declared what yacht it would use to defend the Cup. (Under the provisions of the Deed of Gift, the Defender need not present its boat until the first race.) On December 29, 2009, responding to a letter from GGYC, SNG proposed that a meeting be held in the presence of the Chairman of the International Jury, in order to discuss various concerns, including in particular the interpretation of the \"constructed in country\" provision of the Deed of Gift. SNG stated that, if GGYC's interpretation were followed, then SNG would have similar concerns regarding a number of items of equipment on board GGYC's yacht. SNG also stated that it was concerned that the rig of GGYC's yacht was not as described in the challenge documents dated July 11, 2007. The proposed meeting took place on 12 and 13 January 2010, but no agreements were reached.\nOn January 12, 2010, GGYC opened an action in the New York Supreme Court, asking the Court to enter an order declaring that the sails must be constructed in the country where the competing yacht resides and that SNG's apparent use of \"3DL\" sails would violate the Deed of Gift. On January 22, 2010, SNG replied to GGYC's allegations. According to SNG, the provisions of the Deed of Gift regarding in-country construction do not apply to sails, and, in any case, the sails of its yacht Alinghi 5 were constructed in Switzerland from parts obtained in the USA. Further, SNG alleged that GGYC's yacht USA itself violated the provisions of the Deed of Gift because it was designed in France and key components were designed and made outside the USA. Also, SNG alleged that USA 17 was not a sloop and therefore was not consistent with the description provided in the challenge. Finally, SNG argued that it would be premature for the court to decide such matters before the regatta for procedural reasons; in particular following the precedent set during the 1988 America's Cup, the matter should be decided after the race, if the loser wished to raise it. On 27 January 2010, GGYC submitted its reply to SNG's allegations. Essentially, GGYC pressed its case and stated that its yacht had been constructed in the US and was sloop-rigged.\nOn January 29, 2010, Justice Kornreich of the New York Supreme Court informed the parties via telephone conference that she would not hear the complaint regarding the constructed in country requirement before the match scheduled to begin on 8 February.\nThe America's Cup races then took place in February 2010 but with several legal actions still awaiting decisions from the courts.\nOn 26 March 2010, BMW Oracle Racing announced that the parties had signed an agreement putting an end to all litigation which included GGYC Breach of Fiduciary Duty claim against SNG as well as all other claims relating to the legality of certain construction details of Alinghi V and USA-17. The agreement also included the transfer of various intellectual property rights such as the americascup.com web site and some physical assets to GGYC in their new role as trustee of the America's Cup.\nRegatta.\nBoats.\nBMW Oracle Racing launched a trimaran in August 2008 in Anacortes, Washington. After three weeks of shakedown cruises, the boat was shipped to San Diego, California where it underwent development for the next fourteen months. Initially known as \"BMW Oracle Racing 90\" (BOR90), the yacht was renamed \"USA 17\" upon launch in Valencia conforming with the notice of challenge. The boat was extensively modified during the time in San Diego, most notably in replacing the outer floats, adding powered hydraulics, and fitting a rigid wing sail. At the end of December 2009, the boat was shipped to Valencia, where it arrived on January 4, 2010. After its win in the first race, most observers stated that the rigid wing sail had provided USA with a decisive advantage.\nAlinghi built a catamaran at a boatyard in Villeneuve, Switzerland, called \"Alinghi 5\" which was on the waterline with a bowsprit that makes it \"about overall.\" Somewhat controversially, A5 introduced an engine to power hydraulics. It was launched on July 8, 2009, being lifted from the construction shed in Villeneuve by a Mil Mi-26 helicopter and carried thereby to Lake Geneva. On August 7, 2009, the same type of helicopter transported the boat from Lake Geneva to Genoa, Italy. At the end of September 2009, the boat was shipped to Ras al Khaimah. At the end of December 2009, the boat was shipped to Valencia, where it arrived on January 5, 2010.\nRaces.\nRacing was scheduled to start on February 8, 2010, but unsteady wind conditions caused the first start attempt to be postponed, and the second attempt on February 10, 2010, was aborted due to rough sea conditions.\nRace 1 narrative: An aggressive pre-start by BMW Oracle Racing forced a foul by Alinghi, which had not taken advantage of the diagonal start line allowed for the port-entry boat. Both boats wound up head to the wind over the start line. Alinghi bore off while BMW Oracle Racing remained stalled and started c.650 m behind (1:27). BMW Oracle Racing were clearly able to sail higher and faster (average speed 20.2 kt vs. 19.4 kt), so they caught up with Alinghi within 15 minutes and thereafter extended their lead eventually winning by over 3,000 m. Upwind they were able to out-sail Alinghi even without a jib and their speed differential was greater downwind (23.5 kt vs. 20.7 kt average speed) than upwind. The final delta includes a penalty turn by Alinghi due to not keeping clear at the start. Without the penalty turn the delta was about 8½ minutes. Winds were 5 to 10 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 1h29 upwind, 1h03 downwind.\nRace 2 narrative: Alinghi received a penalty for being in the pre-start area before the designated time. There was very little pre-start maneuvering. BMW Oracle Racing started on starboard tack ahead of Alinghi on port tack. Alinghi sailed faster than during the previous race and benefited from a 20-degree wind shift, which put the Swiss boat in the lead at about the midpoint of the first leg. But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the lay line. BMW Oracle Racing then proved to be much faster on the first reach, pulling about 2 kilometers ahead (26.8 kt vs. 25.2 kt average speed). The final delta includes the penalty turn by Alinghi. Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.\nAftermath.\nStart of Race 2.\nAfter the conclusion of the second race, Principal Race Officer (PRO) Harold Bennett commented that he had encountered problems in starting Race 2.\nThe original Race Instructions issued by the SNG Race Committee (RC) defined the maximum allowed wave height, maximum wind velocity and maximum variation of wind direction across the course in order for a race to be started and completed. It is unusual for specific weather conditions to be inserted in the race instructions because this is usually left to the discretion of the PRO to start a race in conditions which are deemed to be safe and/or allow the race to be completed within the time limit. The consensus of most of the commentators at the time was that the wind conditions defined in the race instructions were artificially low and designed to favour Alinghi 5 which was generally thought to have a better performance than USA 17 in light airs. GGYC appealed these specific limits to the ISAF International Jury who ordered them removed from the Notice of Race, but noted \"that the RC has the obligation to comply with appropriate safety and legal obligations when making a decision to start or continue a race.\"\nThe competitors had been waiting on the water for close to four hours. As the 16:30 deadline for starting a race approached, Bennett ordered the postponement to be taken down indicating that a race starting sequence would soon commence. The SNG Race Committee refused to follow this direction, and left the bridge, moving below decks. In order to continue Bennett had to ask Tom Ehman, the BOR representative on board the committee boat plus a support boat driver to assist with the raising and lowering of flags to complete the start sequence. \"I have never seen such disgraceful behavior on a committee boat, trying to influence the PRO to the point of ordering me to stop the [start] sequence\", wrote Bennett.\nTermination of Legal Action.\nAs detailed above, on 26 March 2010 BMW Oracle Racing announced that agreement had been reached between GGYC and SNG to drop all remaining litigation hence eliminating the prospect of post-race legal disputes.\nLouis Vuitton Trophy.\nBecause of the long delays from the legal action, and the fact that the 33rd America's Cup was a Deed of Gift match without a defender or challenger selection series, the Louis Vuitton Pacific Series was established and raced in January and February 2009 as a competition for other America's Cup racing syndicates. Ten syndicates took part in the regatta which used boats provided by Team New Zealand and BMW Oracle Racing.\nThis initial event was then expanded into the Louis Vuitton Trophy series of events which started in November 2009. These events were designed to be low cost and keep syndicates active while waiting for the 34th America's Cup.\n34th America's Cup.\nAfter the conclusion of the second race Club Nautico di Roma represented by the sailing team Mascalzone Latino, a longtime supporter of BMW Oracle, was named the challenger of record. BMW Oracle Racing promised a multi-challenger regatta."

        "text": "The West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball team represents West Virginia University in NCAA Division I college basketball competition. They are a member of the Big 12 Conference. WVU has won 13 conference tournament championships, and has 31 appearances in the NCAA tournament, including two Final Fours, most recently in 2010. The Mountaineers have also appeared in 16 National Invitation Tournaments (NIT), and have won the tournament twice, in 1942 and 2007. The 1942 NIT Championship is claimed by West Virginia as a National Championship.\nTheir head coach is Darian DeVries. WVU plays their home games at the WVU Coliseum, their home venue since 1970.\nHistory.\nWest Virginia men's basketball has competed in three basketball championship final matches: the 1959 NCAA tournament final, the 1942 NIT final (at that time, the NIT was considered more prestigious than the NCAA), and the 2007 NIT championship. They lost 71–70 to California in the 1959 NCAA finals, while the Mountaineers won the 1942 NIT championship 47–45 over Western Kentucky, and the 2007 National Invitation Tournament contest over Clemson 78–72 in a rebuilding season. In 1949, future Mountaineers head coach Fred Schaus became the first player in NCAA history to record 1,000 points.\nThe most points scored in a game was 132 points against Alaska-Fairbanks in 1994, while the largest margin of victory was against Salem College, with the Mountaineers winning 113–32 in 1945. The largest margin of defeat in Mountaineer basketball history came in 1978 against Louisville, when the Cardinals beat the Mountaineers 106–60.\n1955–1965 era.\nRod Hundley.\nThe modern era of West Virginia basketball history began in 1955, with the emergence of sophomore guard Hot Rod Hundley and newly appointed head coach Fred Schaus. The Mountaineers finished with a 19–11 record, and earned the first NCAA tournament appearance in school history under Hundley's lead. The team entered the tournament with a #19 ranking, the first Top 20 ranking in school history. However, they lost to the #3 La Salle Explorers in the first round of the tourney, 95–61.\nThe following season, 1956, the Mountaineers posted a 21–9 record in Hundley's junior season, which was his best statistically. The team began the season with a #14 ranking, however lost consecutively to #13 George Washington University and #2 North Carolina State, dropping them out of the rankings. They eventually worked their way back to a #19 ranking, before losing to Villanova, La Salle, and Carnegie Tech to drop out of the rankings again. The squad never entered the rankings again on the season until the NCAA tournament, when they reached the #14 ranking. However, they once again lost in the first round to Dartmouth College, 61–59 in overtime.\nIn Hundley's senior season, 1957, the team opened with eight straight victories, including an 83–82 upset over the Duke Blue Devils. The team also reached the #13 ranking before the Duke victory, and then rose to the #8 ranking in the final two victories. It marked the first time a Mountaineer squad was ranked in the Top 10 nationally. Going into the Dixie Classic, the Mountaineers achieved a #4 ranking (the first Top 5 ranking in school history), but lost three straight games in the tourney. The team posted 11 consecutive wins afterwards, rising from a #19 ranking to a #10 ranking. They dropped to #14 after a loss to Penn State, but won the next six games, including the Southern Conference Championship. The #7 Mountaineers were dropped in the first round of the NCAA tournament again however, to the #20 Canisius team, 64–56.\nJerry West.\nAfter Hot Rod Hundley's graduation and departure to the NBA, sophomore guard Jerry West emerged for the Mountaineers and Fred Schaus. In his rookie collegiate season, West helped the Mountaineers to a 26–2 record, with a 12–0 conference record. The Mountaineers began the season with a #8 ranking, as they earned defeats over Penn State, #19 Richmond, and a 77–70 victory over #5 Kentucky in the Kentucky Invitational Tournament. The following game, the Mountaineers upset the #1-ranked nationally North Carolina, 75–65, to win the Kentucky Tourney. After the UNC victory, the Mountaineers rose to the first-ever #1 ranking in school history. In the two wins in the tourney, West totaled 29 points and 19 rebounds. Over the next six-game winning streak, the Mountaineers produced wins over Canisius, Villanova, Pittsburgh, and Furman. However, the Mountaineers were finally toppled by the Duke Blue Devils in Durham, 72–68. The squad retained their #1 ranking however, as they produced victories over Florida State, St. John's, VMI, Penn State, and Pittsburgh. In the final regular-season game, against George Washington, the team went into double overtime to pull out a 113–107 victory, with West earning 25 points and 9 rebounds. The squad swept the Southern Conference tournament, with their closest victory an 11-point win over Richmond in the semi-finals. However, the one-loss squad lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament for the fourth consecutive season, this loss coming to Manhattan, 84–89.\nThe following season, West's junior season at West Virginia, the squad posted a 29–5 record with another undefeated conference record, 11–0. The squad's highest ranking of the season was at a #4 ranking after a Penn State victory in the third game of the season. However, they lost shortly afterwards to Virginia to drop to #7. The Mountaineers posted two more wins, but lost in the Kentucky Invitational Tournament to #2 Kentucky, 91–97. They rose to #5 after the loss, but then lost the following game to #12 Northwestern in double overtime, 109–118. The Mountaineers bounced back however, with a victory over the #11-ranked Tennessee Volunteers. The team dropped to #11 in the rankings, but posted ten straight victories afterwards. The streak included an overtime victory over Penn State and a Backyard Brawl victory over Pittsburgh as the Mountaineers were ranked #10. As soon as the team rose to #9, they lost in overtime to NYU, but posted two straight wins following. The team ended the season with wins over Pittsburgh and George Washington. They swept the Southern Conference tournament for a third straight season. For the first time in Fred Schaus' coaching career at WVU, the Mountaineers advanced further than the opening round of the NCAA tournament. The team eventually won the East Region with victories over #14 St. Joseph's in the semi-finals and Boston University in the finals. In the two games, West scored 69 points in leading the Mountaineers into the Final Four, the furthest ventured in school history. The Mountaineers won their semifinal matchup against the Louisville Cardinals, 94–79; with West scoring 38 points and grabbing 15 rebounds. However, in the championship game, the Mountaineers were bested by California, 70–71. Jerry West was named the tournament MVP, having scored 28 points and gathering 11 rebounds in the championship loss.\nIn the 1960 season following their NCAA tournament championship loss, West led the Mountaineers to a 26–5 record as a senior. The team posted eight straight wins before being ranked, including victories over Tennessee, Richmond, and Kentucky to win the Kentucky Invitational Tournament. Upon being ranked #2 in the nation, the Mountaineers won over the Stanford Cardinal and UCLA Bruins in the Los Angeles Classic, before losing to #3 California in the Championship game. The squad dropped to #3, but posted six straight victories afterwards. The victories included Penn State, Virginia, and Pittsburgh. They lost to William &amp; Mary, but continued with three more victories before their loss to St. John's as they were ranked #5. They finished the season with a victory over Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl, before sweeping the Southern Conference tournament for the fourth straight season, ranking #7 in the nation during the tourney. The squad made it to the semi-finals of the East Region of the 1960 NCAA tournament, but lost to #12 New York University, 81–82. They did finish out their tourney resume with a 106–100 victory over St. Joseph's in the Regional Third Place matchup\nRod Thorn.\nAfter the departure of Jerry West to the NBA draft, sophomore guard Rod Thorn stepped in to fill his place for new head coach George King, much like West did when star guard Hot Rod Hundley graduated for former head coach Fred Schaus in 1958. Thorn helped the Mountaineers to a 23–4 record, 11–1 in conference. Their highest ranking of the season came in the Southern Conference tournament, where they finished it out with a #8 ranking as they lost the Championship for the first time in four years. The Mountaineers season resume included wins over Wake Forest, #19 Memphis State to win the Sugar Bowl, Syracuse, Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech, NC State, and four more victories to end the season over Penn State, Pitt, Penn State again, and George Washington, respectively. The Mountaineers lost in the second round of the Southern Conference tournament to William &amp; Mary, 76–88, which kept them out of the NCAA tournament.\nThe following season, Rod Thorn guided the Mountaineers to a 24–6 record, 11–1 in conference. The Mountaineers won the first six games of the season, but lost the seventh game of the season against #7 Duke, 65–69. They lost the following two games as they earned a #7 ranking, but finished out the three-game Los Angeles Classic with a victory over Army. They once again posted a seven-game win streak after the Classic, including a key win over #5 Villanova. But the squad lost to Virginia Tech, 82–85, before starting another win streak: of four games. The team lost to New York University, but won three games to finish the season. The squad swept the Southern Conference tournament with a Championship win over Virginia Tech, but lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the same Villanova team they had defeated earlier in the season.\nIn Thorn's final season as a Mountaineer, effectively ending the era of WVU basketball, the team posted a 23–8 record with an 11–2 conference record. The team began the season ranked #5, but would end the season with unranked with a loss in the NCAA tournament semi-finals and a victory in the Regional Third Place matchup over #9 New York University. The #3 Mountaineers began the season with a loss to Ohio State in the third game of the season, 69–76. They followed three games later with a loss to #9 Kentucky, as they were ranked #7. The team went unranked before they posted two wins over Boston College in overtime and St. Bonaventure, before losing to #4 Illinois. The team went on a six-game run, where they reached a #9 ranking, but lost as the #6 team nationally to the #4 Duke Blue Devils, 71–111, and then the following loss to Furman. The squad posted three more wins, but then lost again to William &amp; Mary and Pittsburgh. The team won five straight games to finish the season, including sweeping the Southern Conference tournament for the consecutive season. The squad opened up the NCAA tournament with a victory over Connecticut, but then lost in the east region semi-finals to St. Joseph's.\n2001–2005 senior class.\nOther than the late 1950s teams of Jerry West, Rod Hundley, Rod Thorn, and such other greats, the senior squad of 2001–2005 was one of the greatest teams of the school's history, mainly in the 2005–06 campaign. The starting lineup consisted of Johannes Herber and Frank Young (junior) at forward, while J.D. Collins and Mike Gansey played guards. Kevin Pittsnogle started at center, though he led the team with three-point shots. Senior Patrick Beilein (former coach John Beilein's son) got considerable playing time as well. The senior class was led by team MVPs Gansey and Pittsnogle, who were both named to the All-Big East team. The team advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament before losing to Texas 74–71 due to a game-winning three-point shot at the buzzer. This loss marked the end of an era. It consisted of back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances, the first since the 1959 and 1960 teams of Jerry West, and an overall record of 77–51.\n2007 NIT Championship.\nThe team that followed the 2001–2005 senior class was projected to be weak and undeveloped due to lack of experience. Frank Young was the only senior that got considerable playing time from the previous year, although center Rob Summers was a senior as well. Young started at forward, along with Da'Sean Butler, Wellington Smith, and Joe Alexander who all shared time. The guard position consisted of starter Darris Nichols and Alex Ruoff, although Ted Talkington got small action in a few games. Rob Summers started at center all year but shared time with back up center Jamie Smalligan. The primary starting line up was Nichols, Ruoff, Young, Alexander, and Summers, although all other players shared fairly equal time, including forward Da'Sean Butler off the bench.\nThe team, projected to have a bad year with a tough Big East schedule, started out their season 5–0 with an easy early schedule. After a loss to Arkansas, they posted an 8–0 record to make their season record 13–1 before suffering two losses to Notre Dame and Marquette to make their record 13–3. After a win against USF and an overtime loss at Cincinnati, the Mountaineers won four games to make their record 18–4. They were beaten by 13 at home to nationally ranked Pittsburgh, followed by one of the biggest upsets in school history. The upset of #2 UCLA 70–65 made the Mountaineers 19–5, although they lost to Georgetown the next week to make their record 19–6. After a win against Seton Hall, they lost back-to-back against Providence and Pittsburgh both on the road. They then finished out the regular season with a home blowout of Cincinnati to make their record 21–8.\nThe Mountaineers then beat Providence in the first round of the Big East tournament. In the second round, the Mountaineers held with the Louisville Cardinals for two-overtimes, but lost 82–71. The Mountaineers failed to be selected for the NCAA tournament, to the surprise of many West Virginia fans, but they managed to accept a #1 seed in the NIT. The Mountaineers then posted an easy win against Delaware State. The second round the Mountaineers won a shootout 90–77 against UMass, then a nail biting win against North Carolina State at home to win the east region, making the first NIT semifinal appearance since 1981. The semifinal contest against Mississippi State was one of the great wins in Mountaineer history, in which Darris Nichols hit the game-winning three-point shot to win the game 63–62 for the Mountaineers. Two days later in the National Invitation Tournament, the Mountaineers, led by Frank Young's 24 points and Da'Sean Butler's 20 points off the bench, beat Clemson 78–72 to win the university's second NIT crown after their 1942 victory.\nBob Huggins era.\n2007–2008.\nA few days after WVU won the 2007 National Invitation Tournament, coach John Beilein announced he would be leaving the school to accept a head coaching job with Michigan. His official departure on April 4, 2007, was followed a day later by the announcement that Morgantown native Bob Huggins was resigning his post at Kansas State to take the vacant head coaching job at WVU. Huggins was followed by assistant coach Billy Hahn.\nThe Mountaineers earned an 88–65 win over Mountain State in an exhibition game to start the season. West Virginia then entered a match-up against #7 Tennessee with a 2–0 record. However, the Mountaineers lost 74–72. The Mountaineers then posted an eight-game win streak on the way to a 10–1 record. The streak consisted of wins over Auburn, Winthrop, and New Mexico State. West Virginia then lost to Oklahoma 88–82 and then Notre Dame 69–56. They defeated #11 Marquette, 79–64, but followed up with a loss to Louisville 63–54. They then posted four-straight wins over Syracuse, St. John's, South Florida, and Marshall. The Mountaineers then lost to #9 Georgetown 58–57, after a questionable block (or goaltending) call to end the game. However, West Virginia could not rebound in the next game, and lost to Huggins' former job, at Cincinnati, to a final score of 62–39. They rebounded with a 77–65 victory at Providence, but then lost at #25 Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl on a buzzer-beating three-point shot by Pitt's Ronald Ramon to win the game, 55–54.\nWith their record at 16–7, the Mountaineers followed up with an 81–63 victory over Rutgers, then an 89–68 victory over Seton Hall. The Mountaineers were then upset by Villanova, 56–78, but bounced back with an 80–53 victory over Providence. The Mountaineers earned their 20th win of the season in an 85–73 victory over DePaul. With their record at 20–8, the Mountaineers extended its 20-win season streak to four seasons, the best ever since a seven-season streak from 1981 to 1987. Bob Huggins' 20-win season moved his record to at least 20 wins in 22 of his 26 seasons coaching. His twenty 20-win seasons in his collegiate career at the Division 1 level is tied for 12th place all-time. \"I'm old,\" Huggins said of the accomplishment.\nAfter the DePaul victory, the Mountaineers lost a critical game to #16 Connecticut, 79–71. However, Joe Alexander scored a then career-high 32 points and added another 10 rebounds. In the following game, the Backyard Brawl and Senior Night, the Mountaineers won their home game finale over their archrival, the Pittsburgh Panthers, 76–62, to improve to 10–7 in the conference and move to 6th place. Joe Alexander again had a career day by posting a consecutive 32-point performance, also adding 6 rebounds.\nThe Mountaineers finished the year with an 83–74 overtime victory over St. John's, then opened the Big East tournament with a 58–53 victory over Providence. In the second round of the tourney, the Mountaineers upset the #15-ranked Connecticut Huskies, 78–72. Joe Alexander contributed with a career-high 34 points and 7 rebounds. The Mountaineers then, however, lost to the #9 Georgetown Hoyas, 55–72, in the tourney semifinals.\nThe run to the Big East semifinals paved the way for the team to reach the 2008 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament in coach Huggins' first season. The Mountaineers received a #7 seed in the west region, set to play the #10 seed Arizona Wildcats, on March 20. The Mountaineers were victorious over Arizona in their first game of the NCAA tournament with a final score of 75–65. This advanced the Mountaineers into the second round of the tournament to play the Duke Blue Devils for the third time in school history. The team then beat #2 seed Duke, 73–67. They lost the Sweet Sixteen match to #3 seed Xavier in overtime, 79–75. West Virginia finished the season ranked #17.\n2008–2009.\nWest Virginia began the 2008 season projected to finish 9th in the Big East under Huggins. However, they began the season 4–0, led by senior Alex Ruoff, junior Da'Sean Butler, and a freshman class highlighted by Devin Ebanks, Kevin Jones and Darryl Bryant. They lost the Las Vegas Invitational Tournament Championship Game to Kentucky 54–43, but then bounced back with two wins to move to 6–1. However, they lost a last-second game to #22 Davidson and Stephen Curry in Madison Square Garden, 68–65.\nFollowing the loss, WVU posted five straight victories; ending at the beginning of 2009. This streak included a 76–48 win over #13 Ohio State in Columbus, snapping the Buckeyes' nation-long 14-game win streak and handing OSU their biggest home loss since 1998. However, the streak ended in a 61–55 loss to #5 Connecticut which was followed by a 75–53 loss to #15 Marquette. The Mountaineers bounced back with a three-game win streak that included a 75–58 victory over #14 Georgetown in Washington, D.C. However, the streak ended in the 79–67 loss to #4 Pittsburgh in the Backyard Brawl. WVU defeated St. John's, but then lost to #7 Louisville and #20 Syracuse back-to-back. The Mountaineers ended the losing streak with an 86–59 win over Providence, but then lost to #4 Pittsburgh for the second time.\nWest Virginia followed the loss to Pittsburgh with a 93–72 victory over #13 Villanova, featuring Da'Sean Butler's career-high 43 point performance. The Mountaineers then defeated Notre Dame and Rutgers before losing to Cincinnati 70–59 in Huggins's return to Cincinnati. The Mountaineers bounced back with consecutive wins against USF and DePaul, but lost to #6 Louisville 62–59 in Morgantown while hosting College GameDay.\nWest Virginia earned a first round bye in the Big East tournament, and opened the second round of play with a 74–62 victory over Notre Dame. In the quarterfinals round, West Virginia defeated rival #2 Pittsburgh 74–60 in a shocking upset. The Mountaineers next played the #20 Syracuse Orange in the semi-finals, losing 74–69 in overtime. WVU's second consecutive trip to the Big East semi-finals paved the way for a #6 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they would play the #11 seed Dayton Flyers. However, the Mountaineers would be upset by Dayton to the score of 68–60, ending the season.\n2009–2010.\nThe 2009–10 West Virginia Mountaineers team captured the first Big East tournament championship in school history and won the east region to advance to the second Final Four in school history, where they lost in the national semi-finals (Final Four) to eventual national champion Duke, 78–57 after Da'Sean Butler tore his ACL with 8:59 left in the 2nd half. The team finished #3 in the final Coaches Poll with a record of 31–7, setting the record for most wins in school history. Da'Sean Butler scored nine game-winning baskets over the course of the season, including one in each game of the Big East tournament. Butler and Devin Ebanks were both selected in the second round of the NBA draft.\n2010–2011.\nThe West Virginia Mountaineers finished the regular season with a record of 20–11 overall and 11–7 in the Big East, good for sixth place in the conference. They earned a 5th seed in east region of the 2011 NCAA tournament, one of the record eleven Big East Conference teams selected. They defeated the Clemson Tigers in the second round, 84–76, to advance to the Round of 32. In a rematch of last season's Elite Eight match-up, the Mountaineers played the Kentucky Wildcats. Despite holding a 41–33 halftime lead, the Mountaineers lost, 71–63. WVU finished their season with a record of 21–12.\nRivals.\nPittsburgh.\nWith 184 games played between 1906 and 2012, West Virginia's rivalry against Pittsburgh, whose campus is roughly 80 miles north of WVU, is West Virginia's most-played men's basketball rivalry. This was an in-conference rivalry for many years: 1976 to 1982 in the Eastern Collegiate Basketball League and Eastern Athletic Association (predecessors to the Atlantic 10 Conference) and 1995 to 2012 in the Big East Conference. Following the conference realignment, West Virginia moved to the Big 12 Conference in 2012, and Pittsburgh moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2013 and the series was put on hold until the 2017–2018 season. West Virginia has a 97–88 series lead.\nMaryland.\nWest Virginia's interstate rivalry against Maryland dates back to 1926. Except for a period when both schools were in the Southern Conference from 1950 to 1953, this has been primarily an out-of-conference rivalry. From the 1963–64 to 1970–71 seasons, the series was played twice a season, on a home-and-home basis. The series was again played annually from the 1983–84 to 1988–89 seasons then 1990–91 to 1992–93 seasons. In December 2003, the two schools played in Washington, D. C. for the BB&amp;T Classic, with West Virginia winning 78–77 in overtime.\nIn May 2008, West Virginia assistant coach Billy Hahn announced that he and Maryland head coach Gary Williams proposed a home-and-home series that would begin after the 2008–09 season. This plan never materialized, but Maryland and West Virginia met again in the third round of the NCAA tournament on March 22, 2015, with West Virginia winning 69–59. The Mountaineers met Maryland once again in the NCAA Tournament in the Round of 64 on March 16, 2023 in which Maryland won 67-65.\nPenn State.\nWest Virginia had an interstate rivalry with Penn State from 1906 to 1991. The series was played twice annually from the 1982–83 to 1990–91 seasons, as both schools were in the Atlantic 10 Conference then. WVU leads the series 66–53.\nVirginia Tech.\nWest Virginia has an interstate multisport rivalry with the Virginia Tech Hokies. Although the rivalry is heavily focused on football, it also spans to other collegiate sports between the two schools, including basketball. The location of Virginia Tech in Blacksburg, Virginia, along the Appalachian Mountains puts it in direct competition with West Virginia University. It is not uncommon to see families along the Virginia/West Virginia border to be split between the two rivals.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Mountaineers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 31 times. Their combined record is 38–31.\nNCAA tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament in 1978.\"\nNIT results.\nThe Mountaineers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 16 times. Their combined record is 21–16.

        "title": "The Footy Show (rugby league)",
        "text": "The Footy Show was an Australian sports variety television program covering professional rugby league in Australia. It was shown on the Nine Network and aired for 25 seasons. For the final season in 2018, the show was hosted by journalist Erin Molan, and co-hosted by Ryan Girdler and Brad Fittler, with regular contributions from Beau Ryan and Darryl Brohman. It was previously hosted by former rugby league footballer and commentator Paul Vautin for 23 years, with former player and commentator Peter Sterling also an early host from the first 12 years. Having aired on Thursday nights since 1994, the program was largely entertainment-based, with some football-related content included, such as previews of the weekend's fixtures and interviews with players.\nThe name \"The Footy Show\" derives from the diminutive form of the word football commonly used in Australian English.\nOn 2 October 2018, it was announced that the show had been axed and would not continue in 2019.\nScheduling.\nThe NRL version of the show aired every Thursday.\nNSW &amp; QLD\nVIC, TAS, SA, &amp; WA\nFrom 1994 to 2012, \"The Footy Show\" usually aired at 9.30 pm AEST, However, on 28 November 2012, Nine announced that the show would air at 8.30 pm AEST.\nThursdays.\nIn New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and Australian Capital Territory, the NRL version of \"The Footy Show\" aired on Thursday evenings, and the AFL version would air later that night. In the AFL dominated states of Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania, the air time is reversed.\nThe Thursday night NRL version was based around variety with segments, bands and a serious discussion about current issues in the game and past/future match-ups.\nFormer segments included Anti-Ads, National Naan News (with Mahatma Cote), Daredevil Dudes, Hill Report (with Terry Hill), Yesterday's Hero (with Paul Langmack), Going.. Going.. Gooone, \"Crack-a-Fat\", One Versus One, No Talent Time, Their House (with Ryan Girdler later with Bryan Fletcher), Reg Reagan and That's Gold. Crack-a Fat returned as a segment in 2013, while That's Gold returned in 2014.\nPerhaps the most popular segment introduced on \"The Footy Show\" in 2010 is \"Stuff You May Have Missed\", a weekly wrap-up of bloopers that viewers may have missed during the previous NRL round plus many bloopers from various television programs, not just on Channel Nine but other stations. The segment was dropped in 2013.\n2015 segments on the show included \"Kick or Grab\", \"The Footy Show Row Show\", \"The Molan Files\", \"Beau Knows\", \"That's Gold\", \"Perfect Partners\", \"Stuff You May Have Missed\", and \"Player Probe\".\nDue to Thursday night football being featured on the Nine Network for the 2016 NRL season, The Footy Show moved to Wednesdays at 8.30pm from March 2016. However, from 25 August 2016, the show moved back into its former Thursday night timeslot.\nThe show's 500th episode aired on 11 August 2011.\nSundays.\n\"The Sunday Footy Show\" is hosted by Erin Molan, Peter Sterling and Brad Fittler, along with regular panellist Sam Thaiday.\nIn all AFL dominated states, \"The Sunday Footy Show\" is shown on delay at 1pm on 9GEM which is immediately followed at 3pm by Nine's broadcast of Sunday afternoon football (the telecast into SA was controversially canceled in early 2014 but returned in late 2015). Before 2013, \"The Sunday Footy Show\" was not broadcast into the AFL dominated states.\nHistory.\n1990s.\n\"The Footy Show\" debuted in finals week of 1994 at the same time as a sister program The Footy Show (AFL). The original hosts (in 1994) were 'Fatty' aka Paul Vautin, 'Sterlo' (Peter Sterling), and 'Blocker' (Steve Roach), with regular appearances by Ray Hadley. Contrary to what was seen on air, Hadley and Roach did not have a good relationship with the rest of the team, Hadley and Roach left at the end of the 1998 season and 1999 season respectively for varying reasons. Hadley had become disillusioned as a result of the confirmation that the Super League competition would take place in Australia in 1997 (see Super League War). This meant that the Footy Show would be required to give fair coverage and discussion of both the Super League and ARL competitions during its broadcast. Hadley had been a stout supporter of the more traditional ARL, believing that Super League's agenda was backed by money and greed and was not prepared to lend his support to the rival competition, thus leading to his eventual departure from the show. Hadley left at the end of 1996, and returned to the show in 1998, before leaving for good at the end of the 1998 season. Roach, on the other hand, had been involved in an altercation, allegedly assaulting a heckler in a Sydney pub. Channel Nine, not wanting to condone such conduct and wishing to preserve its reputation, were quick to terminate Roach's contract as a result of his actions.\nFor two years, Vautin and Sterling presented the show by themselves, often with guest hosts such as Darryl Brohman, Paul Langmack, Wayne Pearce, Phil Gould, the Johns brothers (Andrew and Matthew), Ryan Girdler with his highly popular segment, \"Their House\", the name a parody of the Australian TV program \"Our House\" (a lifestyle programme).\n2000s.\nIn 2001, a contest was held to find a new co-host, via a parody of the hit show \"Survivor\" (also shown on Nine), and popular Newcastle premiership winning captain Paul Harragon, also known as 'Chief', was selected. In 2003, fellow former Knights player Matthew Johns joined as the fourth host, following the success of his appearances as alter egos Reg Reagan and Trent The Flight Steward the previous year. A new character, Randy Discotelli, based upon an American fitness instructor, was introduced in 2005.\nPaul Harragon's introduction to the show brought popular segments such as 'That's Tops', which involves giving the 'thumbs up' sign with both hands simultaneously. 'That's Tops' ran from 2002 until the end of 2004. Mario Fenech, aka \"The Falcon\", also appears often as a host. In 2005 'That's Gold' was introduced, a hand gesture which involves placing an upright clenched fist on an open palm; both gestures have become popular throughout Australia and New Zealand and are often 'performed' at NRL-related sports venues across the country (the That's Gold segment was re-introduced to the show in 2014).\nIn May 2005, due to declining ratings, former host Ray Hadley was invited back to the show. However, he declined this offer due to his radio commitments on 2GB. Rebecca Wilson was also invited to be part of the show and she accepted. However, Vautin and Sterling disapproved of this move due to personal reasons, and Wilson appeared for only one episode.\nThe show has spawned three \"best of\" video/DVDs, a compilation CD, the Reg Reagan \"All of Me\" DVD and the single \"Am I Ever Gonna See the Biff Again?\" by Reg Reagan and the Knucklemen (Reagan is a parody of a stereotypical ocker football players from the 1970s).\nFor a period of ten weeks from June 2005, the show was hosted by Matthew Johns, due to head injuries suffered by Vautin while filming a comedy sketch for the show. Vautin returned in September 2005. Clive James also guest presented a show during this period.\n\"The Footy Show\" is more a variety show than a typical sports program. This is evident through the many games that the members play such as \"Going, Going, GOOONE!\" and segments such as \"Daredevil Dudes\". It was on one Daredevil Dudes segment where Vautin suffered his head injury when he fell and hit his head on a concrete gutter. Only one match is previewed in significant depth, it generally being the Friday Night showcase.\nIn 2007, Peter Sterling decided not to return to the show so he could concentrate on commentating. The show decided to keep the three hosts (Vautin, Harragon and Johns). In 2008, Laurie Daley joined the show as a fourth host.\nIn early 2009, it was announced that Paul Harragon had quit the show, Laurie Daley had returned to Foxtel (where he first began his television career) and Andrew Voss would join to replace the departing hosts. In May 2009, Matthew Johns was sacked by the network in controversial circumstances.\n2010s.\nIn 2010, the show underwent a format change. Andrew Voss was removed as host (but still remained on the show as a supporting presenter), and Paul Vautin was joined by three other hosts (Peter Sterling (who returned as a co-host after a three-year absence), Wendell Sailor and Darryl Brohman) who alternated their appearances weekly. In 2011, Wendell Sailor and Peter Sterling left as hosts and the show returned to having three weekly hosts with Vautin, Brohman and Brad Fittler. 2012 has seen Fittler leave the show, and former test cricketer Michael Slater become co-host along with Vautin; Brohman was dropped off as co-host and replaced Andrew Voss as a supporting presenter (most notably presenting the segment \"Stuff You May Have Missed\"). He returned to being a co-host in 2013.\nMichael Slater's place on the show had been questioned by fans who continued to ask why a former cricketer is the host of a rugby league oriented television show. Andrew Voss was replaced on the show after 2011 when he was sacked by Nine after comments he made about the statue of the stations lead rugby league commentator Ray \"Rabs\" Warren in Warren's home town of Junee.\n2018 Revamp and Axing.\nIt was announced on 13 October 2017 that the show was set for a refresh in the 2018 season. The format, look and casting of the show was rumored to be changed as Channel Nine entered a new broadcasting deal to show 23 Thursday night NRL games in 2018.\nOn 17 October 2017, reports emerged from various news sources that host Paul Vautin had been axed from the show, whilst other reports stated that the show had been axed altogether, despite being announced as returning at the Nine Network 2018 Upfronts event. It was reported that a new 1-hour show was to be hosted by Erin Molan after the Thursday night NRL fixture, and would be more news-focused rather than a variety format as the show had been classified as in recent years.\nOn 15 January 2018, it was confirmed by the Nine Network that Erin Molan would host a new-look version of \"The Footy Show\", to be broadcast after Nine's regular Thursday night NRL fixtures. Molan was joined by members of the Wide World of Sports commentary team as well as former and current NRL players. Whilst previously announcing his departure from the show, Darryl Brohman along with Beau Ryan confirmed they would remain part of the show in 2018 to continue hosting their regular segments. Paul Vautin's duties were restricted to commentary roles on the network, signalling an end to his 24-year hosting tenure of the show.\nOn 15 February 2018, it was announced that Ryan Girdler would become a full-time panellist in 2018, alongside Wide World of Sports commentator Andrew Johns.\nJames Bracey assumed main hosting duties of the show from 17 May 2018, as Erin Molan departed for maternity leave. She returned to hosting during the 2018 season's final weeks.\nAn emotional Paul Vautin made a guest appearance on 24 May 2018 as the show was broadcast live from Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane. He expressed gratitude and thanked his former colleagues, his family and viewers for supporting his 23-year long tenure as the show's main host, after he was relieved of his duties in October 2017.\nOn 2 October 2018, Channel Nine announced that the show had been axed and would not return to air in 2019. It was replaced by a new Thursday night post-match show called \"Golden Point\", hosted by James Bracey with Paul Vautin featuring as a regular panelist.\n\"Brisbane Footy Show\".\n\"The Brisbane Footy Show\" was the original concept of an \"NRL Footy Show\" devised by the QTQ9 Production Manager John Evans. The show started in 1993 for two years before Channel 9 headquarters in Sydney believed it was a waste of money and resources to have different footy shows airing in different states. \"The Brisbane Footy Show\" started as a high-budget \"live\" show almost solely concerned with League discussion and a music act. The set was large, encompassing the entire of Studio B including a studio audience of more than 100, with a complete green floor (simulating grass) and a large set of goalposts. There were several areas where interviews were conducted, including \"controversy corner\" and the \"bar room\" as well as the main panel desk. The show was hosted by Billy J. Smith during its first year, with Chris Bombolas taking over the following year. Also appearing on the show were Gary Belcher, Kevin Walters (doing Street Beat), Peter Jackson, Mario Fenech, Laurel Edwards and Steve Haddin with a weekly live cross from Sam Newman from the Channel 9 Melbourne \"AFL Footy Show\", who would usually make sarcastic comments towards Mario Fenech. Today, the Sydney version is shown across Queensland.\n\"The Footy Show Fight Night\".\nThe \"Footy Show Fight Night\" is a boxing event, with the inaugural event occurring on 31 January 2015, headlined by Sonny Bill Williams and his bout against Chauncy Welliver.The first \"Footy Show Fight Night\" was hosted by Erin Molan and Beau Ryan, with commentary from Ray Hadley and boxers Jeff Fenech, Danny Green and Anthony Mundine.\nSpecial editions.\nDuring May 2006, the town of Beaconsfield, Tasmania was rocked by a collapse of its local gold mine, trapping 34-year-old Todd Russell and 37-year-old Brant Webb and killing Larry Knight. Miraculously, Russell and Webb escaped with aid from emergency workers. To celebrate, both the AFL and the NRL \"Footy Shows\" had a special program dedicated to the two survivors. This included a cross to Eddie McGuire who held an interview with Brant and Todd.\nIn 2006, to celebrate the State of Origin decider—which was to be held in Melbourne for the first time in years—the two shows were filmed in adjoining rooms, in Nine Network Melbourne's complex. On the \"AFL Show\", Fatty went over from the \"NRL Show\" to join as a guest for a few minutes. Upon his return, a quiz was held between \"AFL Show\" regulars Billy Brownless and Sam Newman, with Matthew Johns and Peter Sterling representing the NRL side. Most of the questions were about either the Melbourne Storm for the NRL boys, since it was a celebration of Melbourne Rugby League, and the Geelong Football Club who Newman and Brownless both played for in the AFL. The AFL boys won the quiz. Also during the show, Newman showed the two boys what he thought of their 2006 Logie by destroying a (presumably) fake Logie while Fatty was on their show.\nIn 2006, the AFL and NRL produced a special broadcast from Germany. This was to coincide with the Socceroos FIFA World Cup campaign. It was co-hosted by Eddie McGuire and James Brayshaw. Unlike the traditional versions, the special was solely based around the Socceroos' World Cup Campaign.\nIn July 2014, \"The Footy Show\" was broadcast from the Newcastle Entertainment Centre in the lead up to the \"Rise for Alex\" round in support of 22-year-old Newcastle Knights player Alex McKinnon who had suffered a career ending neck injury earlier in the season which has (currently) confined him to a wheelchair. As the show was in Newcastle, guests included former \"Footy Show\" presenter and current Knights CEO Paul Harragon, as well as other Knights legends Andrew Johns and Danny Buderus. Newcastle coach Wayne Bennett also appeared for the first time on the show. The show featured interviews Erin Molan had conducted with both McKinnon and Bennett.\nAwards.\nThe Logie Award for Most Popular Sports Program has been going on since 1996 (except 1999 where the award was not given out). The show has won or been nominated every year since this award has been out.\nLogies won: \nLogies nominated: \nIt has also been nominated for:\nCriticism and controversy.\n\"The Footy Show\" has attracted criticism for its often crass, low-brow humour, and been accused of \"celebrating\" alcohol in sport. The program once featured alcohol advertisements throughout, and alcohol advertising on the set.\nMario Fenech, who was often the butt of jokes on the show and later in life suffered cognitive decline due to injuries sustained during his rugby career, admitted that he often resented the way he was treated during his time on the programme.\nInternational broadcast.\nThe program was shown live in New Zealand on Sky Sport.\nDue to the time difference the show was shown on tape delay in the United Kingdom on Premier Sports and in the Republic of Ireland on Setanta Sports. It was normally airs at 10pm on Thursday night, although Premier and Setanta will sometimes show the program earlier in the day in an early evening slot, as well as the 10pm showing.\nAlso aired in Papua New Guinea on EM TV at the same time as The Queensland telecast."

By the time he was in his early 20s, there were few better rugby players anywhere in Auckland. In 1883, he was a member of the first Auckland Union representative team and scored the province's first try against Canterbury, gaining Auckland's first point (tries were only worth one point in those days).\nAll Blacks.\nIn 1884 O'Connor was included in the New Zealand side to tour Australia. This selection came after having a couple of strong seasons for \"Auckland Combined Clubs\" also his bulk (at 89 kg, he and James Allen were the heaviest forwards team) and pace, surprising for such a big man, made him an invaluable tourist. O'Connor played in seven of the matches that year and managed to score a try in the fourth against N.S.W. in [Sydney].\nLater life.\nAfter the 84' tour he came back to resume his club rugby for the Auckland club.

        "text": "Danny Leon Thompson (February 1, 1947 – December 10, 1976) was an American college and professional baseball player, a major league shortstop from 1970 to 1976. Diagnosed with leukemia in early 1973 at age 26, he played four more seasons in the majors and died ten weeks after his final game.\nBaseball career.\nBorn in Wichita, Kansas, Thompson grew up in tiny Capron, Oklahoma, and played college baseball at Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, where he was an All-American. He was the first pick of the Minnesota Twins in the secondary phase of the 1968 amateur draft.\nThompson broke into the majors with the Twins in 1970 and had his first full season in 1972; he played for them until June 1976, when he and pitcher Bert Blyleven were traded to the Texas Rangers for four others in a six-player deal.\nLeukemia.\nFollowing a routine pre-season physical the day before his 26th birthday, Thompson was called in for additional tests and diagnosed with granulocytic leukemia in early February 1973, but he continued his major league career for the next four seasons. He was awarded baseball's annual Hutch Award in Seattle following the 1974 season, and batted .270 in 1975, leading all American League shortstops.\nThompson appeared in 98 games in 1976, and went 1-for-3 in his final start for the Rangers on September 29, appropriately at shortstop in Minnesota's Metropolitan Stadium. In his final game on October 2, less than ten weeks before his death, he was used as a pinch hitter.\nDeath.\nAdmitted to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, on November 16, 1976, Thompson underwent spleen surgery on December 3, and died a week later on December 10, 1976, from complications in Rochester's St. Mary's Hospital. Thompson was 29, leaving behind a wife, Jo, and two young daughters, Tracy and Dana. His funeral was attended by hundreds at the high school gymnasium in Burlington, Oklahoma, and he was buried nearby at the cemetery in his hometown of Capron.\nLegacy.\nDuring the 1977 season, members of the Texas Rangers wore a black armband with the No. 4 on their left uniform sleeve. Examples of this tribute can be seen in the 1978 Topps baseball card set.\nAn annual golf tournament honoring Thompson is held in August in Sun Valley, Idaho. The Danny Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament, benefiting leukemia and cancer research, was launched in 1977 by the Hall of Famer Harmon Killebrew (1936–2011), a former teammate with the Twins; and Ralph Harding (1929–2006), a former Idaho congressman. The first edition included former President Gerald Ford, Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill, and Hall of Fame slugger Mickey Mantle. It has donated over $15.6 million since its inception. Killebrew disclosed his esophageal cancer in late 2010 and died five months later at age 74. Following Killebrew's death, the event was renamed the \"Killebrew-Thompson Memorial Golf Tournament\" (KTM), with events in Idaho and Minnesota."

A forward, he was a member of the first New Zealand national team in 1884, and later played for New South Wales.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Piltown, County Kilkenny in Ireland in 1860, O'Donnell left Ireland with two of his brothers and a sister to escape their \"tyrannical\" father. Another brother fled the country after cutting off an English soldier's ear. Settling in New Zealand, O'Donnell is thought to have served in the police force and worked as a teacher.\nRugby union.\nNew Zealand.\nDespite living in Invercargill, he represented Otago in 1883, as the Southland Rugby Union was not formed until 1887.\nIn 1884. O'Donnell was selected for the first national side to tour Australia but before he even got to Wellington to join the team, he was arrested on a fugitive warrant at Clinton and returned to Invercargill. Local tradespeople to whom he owed money had taken out the warrant after hearing that O'Donnell was unlikely to return from Australia. However none of the creditors attended the court hearing so he was able to join the team in Wellington as expected. Once on tour O'Donnell played in seven of the nine tour matches (none of them internationals), scoring four tries and was regarded as the speediest team member. Tour manager Samuel Sleigh described him as a \"fast wing forward\".\nNew South Wales.\nAs his creditors feared, O'Donnell remained in Australia at the end of the tour. He went on to represent New South Wales between 1884 and 1888, and played against the 1888 British team. His son Jack O'Donnell also represented New South Wales.\nLater life and death.\nIn 1901, O'Donnell contested the seat of Randwick for the Progressive Party in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, but was defeated by the incumbent, David Storey.\nFollowing the death of John Dumbell in 1936, O'Donnell was the oldest living All Black. He died in Randwick, New South Wales on 1 May 1942 and was buried at Waverley Cemetery."

The Veterans Committee met in closed sessions to consider older major league players as well as managers, umpires, executives, and figures from the Negro leagues. It selected two, Tony Lazzeri and Bill Veeck. A formal induction ceremony was held in Cooperstown, New York, on July 21, 1991.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was authorized to elect players active in 1971 or later, but not after 1985; the ballot included candidates from the 1990 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 1985. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate receiving votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. The ballot consisted of 45 players; a total of 443 ballots were cast, with 333 votes required for election. A total of 2,948 individual votes were cast, an average of 6.65 per ballot.

        "text": "The 40th Edition \"Vuelta a España\" (Tour of Spain), a long-distance bicycle stage race and one of the 3 grand tours, was held from 23 April to 12 May 1985. It consisted of 19 stages covering a total of 3,474 km. The race was won by Pedro Delgado of the Orbea cycling team.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe Spanish favourites for the general classification of the race were Pedro Delgado, Faustino Rupérez and Pello Ruiz Cabestany and the potential foreign favourites included Robert Millar – now known as Philippa York, Sean Kelly, Éric Caritoux, Peter Winnen and Gianbattista Baronchelli.\nRace Overview.\nIn 1985 the Vuelta a España was still held in its April – May slot as the first of the three grand tours of the season. A young Miguel Induráin took the lead on stage 2. Pedro Delgado won stage 6 to the Lagos de Covadonga and took over the race leader's jersey. Delgado lost the lead the following day to Pello Ruiz Cabestany. Robert Millar – now known as Philippa York then took the lead after the tenth stage, a stage won by Kelly.\nMillar held the lead going into what has become one of the most infamous days in the history of the event, the penultimate day of the race, stage 18. Millar started the day 10 seconds ahead of Colombian Francisco 'Pacho' Rodríguez with Spain's Pello Ruiz Cabestany 65 seconds further behind in third. With the following day's last stage of the race little more than ceremonial, Millar said to the press, \"I just have to stick to Pacho Rodríguez's wheel and it's done.\" A mountainous stage with three major climbs, Rodriguez tried but was unable to make a successful attack on Millar on the first climb of the day, the Morcuera. At the foot of the second climb, the Cotos, Millar punctured meaning once the puncture had been fixed Millar had to chase to get back to Rodrigues and Cabestany. By the time the riders reached the third climb, Los Leones, Millar had not only reached the main GC favorites, but was also taking their congratulations indicating their submission that the race over as a contest.\nMillar however was unaware that Delgado, in the mountains around his Segovia hometown that he knew like the back of his hand, had launched an attack. None of the riders in Millar's group made him aware of the attack by Delgado – an elite specialist climber like Millar and in this case with the knowledge of the roads allowing him to descend aggressively. Delgado had support in his break from a second rider, José Recio. Delgado had started the day in sixth place and 6 minutes behind Millar. Working with Recio, Delgado was now nearly 7 minutes ahead of Millar on the road. Millar had none of his teammates in this group with the other contenders and was isolated. Recio won the stage and Delgado took overall lead of the race. With the race now referred to as \"The stolen Vuelta', from the collusion among the Spanish speaking riders, Millar finished second overall. Peugeot directeur sportif, Roland Berland, said, \"It's rotten, the whole peloton was against us. It seems a Spaniard had to win at all costs.\" \"L'Équipe\"s Philip Bouvet stated, Millar was \"the victim of a formidable Spanish coalition\". Millar said afterwards, \"I'll never return to Spain\". In the television documentary on York, \"The High Life\", Millar criticised Berland for his handling of the situation on the road when Delgado attacked. Berland had been unable to negotiate support from other non Spanish speaking teams during the stage to give Millar the required support to chase down Delgado's lead.\nIn 1985 and 1986, a national team of the communist Soviet Union participated in the Vuelta. At the time, it was unusual for Soviet riders to participate in professional races.\n1985 also saw the participation of the first U.S. professional team sponsored by Rank-Xerox and managed by Robin Morton, the first woman to manage a men's professional cycling team."

The sport was first introduced to Italy in the early 1800s by British expatriates who were living in the country. The game quickly caught on among the Italian elite, and soon there were cricket clubs popping up all over the country.\nOne of the earliest and most influential cricket clubs was the Rome Cricket Club, which was founded in 1820 by a group of wealthy English and Italian cricket enthusiasts. The club quickly became the hub of Italian cricket and attracted players from all over the country.\nBy the mid-1800s, Italian cricket had become so popular that the country was invited to participate in the first-ever international cricket tournament, which was held in London in 1851. Despite being relative newcomers to the sport, the Italian team managed to hold their own against more experienced teams from England, Australia, and India, and even managed to win a few matches.\nThroughout the rest of the 19th century, Italian cricket continued to thrive and grow, with new clubs and leagues popping up all over the country. The sport even managed to gain some political influence, with prominent politicians and members of the royal family becoming avid cricket enthusiasts and patrons of the sport.\nHowever, the early 20th century saw a decline in Italian cricket, as the country was swept up in World War I and World War II. Many cricket clubs were forced to disband, and the sport lost much of its popularity and support.\nToday, Italian cricket is largely a forgotten relic of the past, with only a handful of cricket clubs still active in the country. However, for those who know the history of the sport, Italian cricket remains a fascinating and important part of the global cricketing community.\nSee also.\nItalian national cricket team"

It consisted of 19 stages covering a total of 3,593 km, and was won by Éric Caritoux of the Skil–Sem cycling team. It was one of the most surprising grand tour victories in cycling history as Caritoux, a virtual unknown who was part of a lineup that was thrown together at the last minute, won by the closest margin in history.\nCaritoux, a second year professional, had shown his climbing talent earlier that year by winning the stage up the Mont-Ventoux of the 1984 Paris–Nice but he did not enter the 1984 Vuelta a España thinking of the overall classification.\nOn stage 8 Roger De Vlaeminck, one of the oldest riders professionally, won the first Vuelta stage of his career which gave him a stage win in all three grand tours. Fourteen years earlier he won his first grand tour stage during the 1970 Tour de France and had won 22 Giro stages in between. On the 12th stage to Lagos de Covadonga an area in Asturias which includes one of the most important climbs of the Vuelta, Caritoux finished second behind the German Raimund Dietzen. Caritoux took the leader's jersey from Pedro Delgado. Alberto Fernández was 32 seconds behind Caritoux in the general classification at that stage. Fernández had been third the year previously in the Vuelta a España and in the Giro d'Italia. On the stage 14 mountain time trial, Caritoux lost five seconds. Caritoux lost further time in the final individual time trial but still managed to finish the race with a slender lead of six seconds over Fernández, the smallest margin in the history of the Vuelta a España, and also the smallest ever seen in a Grand Tour. Fernández died later on in 1984.\nTeams.\nThirteen teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1984 edition of the Vuelta a España, six of which were based outside of Spain. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, meaning that the race started with a peloton of 130 cyclists. From the riders that began the race, 97 made it to the finish in Madrid.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nCovering a total of , it included three individual time trials, and thirteen stages with categorized climbs that awarded mountains classification points. Two of these thirteen stages had summit finishes: stage 7, to Rassos de Peguera; and stage 12, to Lagos de Enol. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 14, which consisted of a climbing time trial to Monte Narasco. The organizers chose to include no rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was longer and contained the same amount of time trials, stages, and rest days.\nClassification leadership.\nThree different jerseys were worn during the 1984 Vuelta a España. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a golden jersey. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Vuelta.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a light blue jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The leader of the mountains classification wore a green jersey.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run."

        "title": "List of national anthem performers at the Super Bowl",
        "text": "The U.S. national anthem \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" has been performed at all but one Super Bowl since its first year in 1967; Vikki Carr sang \"America the Beautiful\" in place of the anthem at Super Bowl XI in 1977. Since Super Bowl XVI in 1982, famous singers or music groups have performed the anthem at the vast majority of Super Bowl games and was accompanied by an American Sign Language (ASL) performer since Super Bowl XXVI in 1992. \nBeginning with Super Bowl XLIII in 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" is sung before the national anthem every year and is followed by the presentation of the colors and a military flyover preceded the anthem. Beginning in 2021, \"Lift Every Voice And Sing\" was sung prior to \"America the Beautiful\" and the national anthem in honor of Black History Month. Some early Super Bowls featured marching bands performing the anthem and the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance.\nMultiple and hometown performances.\nActs that have performed three times:\nActs that have performed two times:\nSingers that performed in or near their hometown metropolitan area:\nNotable performances.\nThe performance by Whitney Houston at Super Bowl XXV in 1991, during the Gulf War, has been for many years regarded as one of the best renditions ever. It was released as a single a few weeks later, appeared on the album \"\", and was re-released as a single in 2001 shortly after the September 11 attacks.\nThe 1992 performance marked the first time American Sign Language was used alongside the lead singer.\nFaith Hill performed the anthem at Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. Following the September 11 attacks, her version entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number 35.\nControversies.\nSince 1993, the NFL has required performers to supply a backup track. This came after Garth Brooks walked out of the stadium prior to his XXVII performance. Only 45 minutes before kickoff, he refused to take the stage, due to a dispute with NBC. Brooks requested that the network premiere the music video for his new single \"We Shall Be Free\" during the pregame. The network chose not to air the video, due to content some felt was disturbing imagery. Brooks had also refused to pre-record the anthem, which meant the league had nothing to play if he left. Television producers spotted Jon Bon Jovi in the grandstands, and were prepared to use him as a replacement. After last-minute negotiations, NBC agreed to air a clip of the video during the broadcast of the game, and Brooks was coaxed back into the stadium and sang.\nFollowing the \"wardrobe malfunction\" controversy during Super Bowl XXXVIII in 2004, all scheduled performers for Super Bowl XXXIX were chosen under heavy scrutiny. Game organizers decided not to use a popular music vocalist. The combined choirs of the U.S. Military Academy, the Naval Academy, Air Force Academy, Coast Guard Academy, and the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets were invited to perform. This was the first time since the second inauguration of President Richard Nixon in 1973 that all four service academies sang together.\nTwo days after Super Bowl XLIII, it was revealed that Jennifer Hudson also had lip synced.\nAt the beginning of Super Bowl XLV, Christina Aguilera sang the lyrics incorrectly. Instead of singing \"O'er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming\", the pop star sang \"What so proudly we watched at the twilight's last gleaming\". According to the \"New York Times\", she also changed \"gleaming\" to \"reaming\".\nOther patriotic performances.\nThe following Super Bowls featured other patriotic performances besides the national anthem. Since 2009, \"America the Beautiful\" is sung before the national anthem."

        "text": "George Carter ( – ) was one of New Zealand's first-ever rugby union representatives, playing for the All Blacks. Representing New Zealand in 7 Matches in 1884. Carter won praise from team manager Samuel Sleigh who wrote: \"No amount of knocking seemed to have the slightest effect on this hard-working forward.\" He came into the New Zealand team for the Australian tour after Bob Whiteside and then Frank Clayton withdrew.\nGeorge Carter had a first-class record: Auckland 187577,80,82,83 (Auckland). \"George Carter's association with rugby dates back to the codes earliest days in Auckland\".\nRugby career.\nRugby was originally played in Auckland under mainly Victorian Rules since 1866.\nFollowing a successful tour of New Zealand in 1882 by a New South Wales team, an invitation was issued by the Southern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the New South Wales RFU) for a New Zealand team to visit that colony. In the absence of a national body controlling rugby, the arranging of the tour fell to Dunedin businessman Samuel Sleigh, who became the team's manager, and the secretary of the Canterbury Rugby Union, William Millton. The latter, a barrister and a brilliant all-round sportsman, had captained the Canterbury side since 1878 and was to lead the first-ever New Zealand rugby team.\nOriginally the Southern RFU had offered the New Zealand team all the profits from the tour, plus hotel and travelling expenses from Wellington to the return to the same port for 17 men, with the team playing six matches. Subsequent negotiation extended the offer to all 19 men and included the coastal fares, with the number of matches increased to eight. The original nominations for the team had members who could not compete due to expenses and unavailability to leave their job the replacements included J G Lecky &amp; rugby veteran George Carter. George Carter had a lengthy career in Rugby by this time, having played since he was 18 years old.\nIt was generally agreed that the team was a very judicious selection, considering the difficulties associated in getting a first-class team from one colony to another. Four uneventful days at sea saw the tourists amuse themselves by participating in quoits, wrestling, boxing &amp; similar pastimes. When seas were calm enough a type of football was played and on the final day a North Island vs South Island tug-of-war resulted in a win for the North Island by two pulls to one.\nParamatta presented a crowd of 600 to watch the game &amp; It was soon apparent that the local combination would be no match for the visitors. The visitors maintained great pressure the score at half time 17–0. during the 10-minute interval some of the local team removed their boots for the second spell, which did little to aid their team whose play was described as 'crude'. The New Zealanders continued to dominate their opponents the final score being 33–0.\nNew South Wales presented a crowd of 4000 people to watch the match, with 'delightful' weather, NSW in Olive Green &amp; New Zealand in Dark Blue with a Gold Fern on the left breast ran out before the large crowd. two-halves of 50 Minutes would be played. from the kick-off play was fast and furious with the tourists forcing a touch-down after 3 minutes. halftime score 4–0 to the NZ'ers, after 10-minute adjournment NZ resumed attack with the home team defending. The match played in the best of spirits had resulted in a clear-cut 11–10 victory to the New Zealanders. the Sydney Morning Herald commented, \"The home team played pluckily enough but were simply overmatched.\"\nIn 1874 rugby had become the preferred code, and clubs were forming, there were at least six in 1874.\nThe team was picked from players in Auckland clubs and called Auckland Combined Clubs. This team is now known as the first first-class side in New Zealand rugby history. The match they played with Dunedin Clubs in Dunedin was also known as the first representative match in this country. Auckland's results were not good, suffering five heavy defeats in as many matches. Carter had been a member of the touring team and was among the first 30 players to appear in New Zealand representative rugby.\nAlthough normally a forward, he was one of Auckland's three fullbacks in that first representative match. He represented Auckland for nearly a decade, although matches were few and far between. He was normally one of the first men picked and played in the second New South Wales match in 1882, when Auckland gave the tourists a hiding, 18–4. In 1883, when the newly formed Auckland union played its first matches, Carter was playing.\nGeorge Carter played all three games that season at halfback. New Zealand rugby men had had good results against New South Wales in 1882 and in 1884 they returned. As the four unions then in existence all supported the venture, each was invited to nominate players to make up the team. Carter wasn't among the original choices, but was one of two men invited to replace other Aucklanders (Bob Whiteside, Frank Clayton, and J.C. Webster), who withdrew after selection.\nGeorge Carter played at wing forward in the match against Wellington and is therefore among the original 15 New Zealand representatives. He appeared in six of the eight matches in Australia, including two of the three against New South Wales (Australia).\nRecorded in the Te Aroha News 24 September 1888 A match between Tauranga vs Katikati Katikati having a powerful contingent of Auckland Players including T O'connor, O Wells, G Carter &amp; Hobson. The Tauranga players showed a great improvement on their play against the Auckland team having taken to heart the lessons they were taught on that occasion\nPonsonby.\nGeorge Carter's name appears on the Ponsonby Rugby Football Club Honours Board as one of New Zealand's Earliest All Blacks and First ever rugby union representatives. A letter was presented from the \"Ponsonby Rugby Football Old Boys' Association\" Hon. Secretary to the daughter of George Carter, Mrs Harris on her 102nd Birthday 27 August 1981 stating \" We were interested to learn that you are a daughter of George Carter who was the Ponsonby Clubs' first All Black when he was selected to represent New Zealand in 1884\".\nExternal links.\nAuckland Rugby Union Team"

He was an All-Big Ten player for the University of Michigan from 1935 to 1938. In 1938, he was named an All-American. He later played professional basketball for the Indianapolis Kautskys, Oshkosh All-Stars and Rochester Royals.\nHigh school basketball in Indiana.\nA native of Indiana, Townsend played for Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis. He led Arsenal Tech to the state finals in 1934, losing to Logansport. He was the leading scorer in the State Finals and was named All-State in basketball in Indiana twice and won the Dyer Medal, Indianapolis' top athletic award.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nHe played collegiately for the University of Michigan from 1936 to 1938. Townsend was named to the All-Big Ten team and led Michigan in scoring each year from 1936 to 1938. Considered the greatest Michigan basketball player in the era before Cazzie Russell, Townsend was six feet, four inches (102 mm) tall.\nKnown as the \"Houdini of the Hardwood\", Townsend scored 108 points in 1936 and was the only sophomore selected for the All-Big Ten team. The Associated Press chose Townsend as the All-Big Ten center in 1936 even though he played regularly at forward throughout the season. He was joined on the team by his older brother, Earl Townsend; who was the team captain. Earl had earlier led DePauw University to the 1934 Indiana Intercollegiate Conference title before transferring to Michigan.\nIn 1937, Townsend was again selected on the All-Big Ten team and finished second in conference in scoring. He had 40 field goals and made 43 out of 59 free throws for 123 points. Described by the AP as \"the great Wolverine ball-handler\", he was \"generally credited with being the best ball handler in the Big Ten.\"\nIn 12 games in 1938, Townsend had 45 field goals, converted 45 of 64 free throws, and finished fourth in the conference with 135 points. He was named an All-Big Ten player by both the United Press and the Associated Press for the third straight year. The United Press noted that Townsend was a unanimous choice for the second consecutive year. Though Purdue's Jewell Young was the Big Ten scoring leader in 1938, Townsend excelled as a scorer, rebounder, and ball-handler. The United Press said: \"It was Townsend's third year on the all-star team. He won his first recognition as a center, twice more as a forward. Players, especially, conceded Townsend was the greatest all-around man in the conference.\" The Associated Press said: \"John (Jake) Townsend of Michigan won the center assignment by a big margin and in 'making' the team for the third consecutive year, accomplished a rare feat in Big Ten basketball. Rated as the greatest player in Michigan hardwood history, Townsend received first place votes, either at forward or center, from nine coaches. The other one picked him for the second five.\"\nIn 1938, he became the fourth consensus All-American in school history. Townsend also competed for Michigan in the shot put and discus. He was ranked fifth in the country in the discus. He earned five varsity letters at Michigan – three in basketball and two in track.\nProfessional ball.\nImmediately after graduating, Townsend played baseball in 1938 in the Bush-Feezle State League for the Indianapolis team. The Kokomo Tribune noted in late August: \"The Indianapolis aggregation is led by Johnny Townsend, former Technical high basketball star and an All-American cage player at The University of Michigan. Latest statistics . . . show Townsend, a center fielder, is the loop's leading slugger. Townsend showed his prowess with the war club Wednesday when he tripled with the bags loaded to defeat the Muncie Acme-Lees team, 6-4.\"\nIn October 1938, Ed Ciesar, owner of the Hammond Ciesers announced he had signed Townsend to a professional basketball contract. Townsend played professional basketball in the NBL as a member of the Indianapolis Kautskys, Oshkosh All-Stars and Rochester Royals.\nLater years.\nTownsend later became a lawyer in Indianapolis. He also officiated basketball games in the 1940s for the Big Ten Conference, as well as four Indiana-Kentucky all-star games. He later worked as a broadcaster and coach.\nHonors and awards.\nHe was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1972; the 11th class to be honored; in 1980 he was named to the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor as part of the third induction class. Only two basketball players, Cazzie Russell and Rudy Tomjanovich were inducted into the Hall of Honor before Townsend. In 2000, The Sporting News picked Townsend as a member of its Michigan all-time basketball team; he was one of only two players from before 1974 named to the team. \nFamily.\nTownsend's grandson, Eric Montross, played basketball at the University of North Carolina and in the NBA.\nCareer statistics.\nNBL.\nSource"

        "text": "Johnny Joe Lewis (August 10, 1939 – July 29, 2018) was an American professional baseball player, coach, scout and front-office executive. An outfielder, he appeared in 266 games in Major League Baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals and New York Mets from to . He batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as weighing and in height. He was born in Greenville, Alabama.\nLewis was signed as a free agent by the Detroit Tigers, but his career record lists no games played for a Detroit farm team; his first pro season, 1959, was spent with three Class D clubs in the Cardinals' organization. In 1960, he led the Class C Northern League in home runs and runs batted in, and was named an All-Star; the following year, he was promoted all the way to Double-A, and made the Texas League All-Star team as well. Lewis was an early-season member of the 1964 Cardinals, making his debut on April 14 against the Los Angeles Dodgers. But he was sent back to Triple-A in June after playing in 40 games; he was recalled when the minor-league season ended but did not appear in a game during the Cardinals' thrilling, late-season stretch drive that brought them the National League pennant and World Series title. On December 7, 1964, he was included in a four-player transaction to the Mets, for whom he would play 226 games over three seasons.\nAs a Met, Lewis is probably best known for breaking up a Jim Maloney no-hitter in the 11th inning with a game-winning homer. In that June 14, 1965, contest at Crosley Field, Maloney threw ten no-hit innings, until Lewis' homer in the 11th broke the skein. Two batters after Lewis, Roy McMillan reached Maloney for a single. Maloney ended up with a complete game, two-hit defeat, 1–0, fanning 18 New York hitters. The Mets' veteran pitcher Frank Lary and reliever Larry Bearnarth combined for the shutout, allowing seven hits. Lewis was nicknamed \"The Gunner\" with the Mets for his ability to throw out runners; he played most of his games in right field (175) and center field (57) during his MLB tenure.\nLewis' professional playing career ended in 1968 after ten seasons. He rejoined the Cardinals in 1969 and became the club's administrative coordinator of player development and scouting. He returned to the field as a coach for the Cardinals (1973–76, 1984–89) at the big-league level—the Redbirds' first African-American coach—and managed their Rookie League affiliate, the Calgary Cardinals, in 1977 and 1978. He also spent many years as a St. Louis scout.\nDuring his major league playing career, Lewis collected 174 hits, with 24 doubles, six triples and 22 home runs, batting .227 with 74 career RBI. Defensively, he had 20 outfield assists.\nJohnny Lewis died July 29, 2018, in Pensacola, Florida, at age 78."

        "title": "National Basketball Players Association",
        "text": "The National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) is the labor union that represents National Basketball Association (NBA) players. It was founded in 1954, making it the oldest trade union of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. However, the NBPA did not get recognition by NBA team owners until ten years later. Its offices are located in the historic Park and Tilford Building in New York City. It was briefly a trade association after dissolving as a union during the 2011 NBA lockout.\nHistory.\nFounding and struggle for recognition (1954–1957).\nIn 1954, Celtics star point guard Bob Cousy and friend and unofficial agent Joe Sharry canvassed long-tenured players on each of the league's teams by mail, including the fledgling NBA's stars Paul Arizin and Dolph Schayes, and received support from the majority to approach the NBA President Maurice Podoloff. Cousy and the players sought basic improvements of conditions including being paid for promotional activities, a limit of twenty exhibition games per season, impartial dispute arbitration, and moving expenses for traded players. While back pay for players of folded franchises was granted by Podoloff, the NBA refused to acknowledge the players association or make other changes until Cousy approached the AFL-CIO in 1957 and the players threatened a strike.\nRecognition, early successes, stalled negotiations (1957–1964).\nAfter formal recognition by the NBA, the NBPA won its players per diem payments and travel expenses and an increase in the playoff pool payment, and the majority of the previously demanded conditions. In 1958, however, dismayed at the lack of dues payments by players, Cousy would resign his position from frustration. He was succeeded by Celtics second-year player Tom Heinsohn, who had studied labor relations at university and worked as a pension planner for an insurance company in his day job, and whose father was a union official in Union City, New Jersey. Heinsohn began negotiating a pension plan for players, asking $100 per month for five years of service and $200 per month for 10 years of service for players aged over 65. Negotiations stalled with new NBA President Walter Kennedy and the NBP and the league entered a stalemate for most of 1964.\n1964 All-Star game strike.\nAt the 1964 NBA All-Star Game in Boston, Heinsohn organised a wildcat strike to force the NBA owners to recognise the union's demands. The game was to be the struggling NBA's first live television broadcast, and the league had to this point ignored the NBPA's demands delivered to league offices during the NBA off-season, and repeatedly refusing to meet with or acknowledge executive director Larry Fleisher as the union's authorized bargaining agent. The NBPA presented the assembled team owners with a list of demands to be met before the All Star game would be played: the pension plan, athletic trainers for every team, and the removal of matinee Sunday games after Saturday night games from the schedule. After 22 minutes of the players holding out in a locker room, the door of which was guarded by a Boston police officer and with owners threatening the players with blacklisting and punishment, league commissioner Walter Kennedy agreed to the player's demands, and the live broadcast went to air after a slight delay.\nSalary cap.\nIn 1983, players and owners reached a historic agreement, that introduced the \"salary cap\" era into professional sports. This was believed to be the first salary cap in any major professional sports league in the United States.\n1995 NBA labor dispute.\nThe NBA experienced its first work stoppage, when owners imposed a lockout, that lasted from July 1 through September 12, when players and owners reached an agreement. Because the lockout took place during the off-season, no games were lost.\n1998–99 lockout.\nThe second NBA lockout, which ran into the 1998–99 season, lasted almost 200 days, and wiped out 464 regular-season games. After players and owners reached an agreement, the season did not start until February 5, 1999, with each of the 29 NBA teams playing a 50-game schedule.\n2011 lockout.\nThe current collective bargaining agreement was reached in July 2005, and expired at 12:01 EST on July 1, 2011, following completion of the 2010–11 NBA season, resulting in a lockout, similar to the 2011 NFL lockout. ESPN has reported that the owners and players failed to reach an agreement and broke off negotiations, and that the owners began a lockout immediately after the collective bargaining agreement expired.\nThe primary sticking point within negotiations was the shares of Basketball Related income, player movement and the soft salary cap. Basketball Related Income or BRI is profits from ticket sales, merchandising sales, and other profits related to basketball, this revenue is split between players and the team but in initial negotiations the teams proposed a reduction players' share being from 57% to 50%. As well, with the forming of Big Three (Miami Heat) and increased player movement towards larger market teams. This concerned smaller market teams and encouraged them to establish a hard salary cap.\nOn November 14, the NBPA was converted from a union into a trade association, enabling the players as individual employees to be represented by lawyers in a class action antitrust lawsuit against the league, calling the lockout an illegal group boycott. The NBPA re-formed as a union on December 1, receiving support from over 300 players, exceeding the requirement for at least 260. After the players and owners reached a new agreement, the lockout ended on December 8 and the 2011–12 season began on December 25 with a 66-game schedule.\n2013–present.\nIn February 2013, Billy Hunter was ousted unanimously as executive director of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) amid charges of nepotism and other concerns. 17 months later on July 29, 2014, Michele Roberts, a Washington, D.C. litigator, was elected as the new executive director of the National Basketball Players Association. She became the first female executive director of NBPA and the first woman to head a major professional sports union in North America. She would help avoid an opt-out labor dispute from occurring in 2017 with negotiations taking place early in 2016.\nIn February 2018 at All-Star Weekend, the NBPA unveiled its new marketing and licensing arm, THINK450, the innovation engine of the NBPA. The union controls the intellectual property rights of the 450 players as a group off the court, giving way for brand partnerships and sponsorship opportunities.\nAfter the season had been suspended earlier in the year, on June 5, 2020, the NBPA approved negotiations with the NBA to resume the regular season for 22 teams in the NBA Bubble.\nDuring the 2020 NBA Finals, NBPA President Chris Paul announced that over 90% of NBA players had registered to vote for the 2020 presidential election. He also stated that 15 teams in the league were 100% registered to vote. By contrast, the league only had 20% of players registered to vote in the 2016 presidential election. The players took multiple actions in the NBA Bubble: writing phrases or names on the back of their jerseys to support the Black Lives Matter movement, boycotting games in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake, and taking a knee during the national anthem to protest against racial inequality and police brutality.\nLeadership.\nVice presidents.\n First vice president\nInitiatives.\nThe NBPA organizes Sportscaster U., an annual broadcasting training camp at Syracuse University in association with the S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications. In past ten years, hundreds of NBA players have attended this camp, and went on to successful careers in broadcasting."

        "title": "Australian Formula 1",
        "text": "Australian Formula 1 (AF1) was a motor sport category for open-wheeler racing cars which was current in Australia from 1970 to 1983.\nAF1 was introduced by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport in 1970, initially restricting cars to unsupercharged engines of no greater than 2.5-litre capacity, running on commercial fuel. AF1 was essentially a new name for the Australian National Formula which had been Australia’s premier racing category from 1964 to 1969.\nEffective 23 February 1971, AF1 was changed to a two-part formula catering for racing cars fitted with 5.0-litre production based pushrod V8 engines (internationally known as Formula 5000 cars) and those fitted with less restricted unsupercharged engines of eight cylinders or less and up to 2000 cc in capacity. The smaller engine option was discontinued after 1976. The main engines used were Chevrolet and Repco-Holden V8's, though occasionally a Ford V8 was seen in action without success.\nIn March 1979, Formula Pacific cars (using 1.6-litre production-based four-cylinder engines) became eligible for Australian Formula 1 alongside the existing 5.0-litre cars and 1980 saw the addition of 3.0-litre FIA Formula One cars to the mix. For 1982, Australian Formula 1 was restricted to Formula Pacific cars only. In 1983 CAMS adopted Formula Mondial as the new Australian Formula 1 but allowed cars complying with Formula Pacific to compete alongside the new cars for that year. (Formula Mondial was an FIA approved international formula very similar to Formula Pacific but with cars restricted to using the 1.6-litre Ford Cosworth BDA four-cylinder engine.) For 1984 CAMS changed the category name from “Australian Formula 1” to “Formula Mondial”.\nThe Australian Drivers' Championship (for the CAMS Gold Star award) was open to drivers of AF1 cars throughout the life of the formula, i.e. from 1970 to 1983. During those years the term Australian Formula 1 Championship was often used in lieu of Australian Drivers Championship however the latter is used by the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport in its official records of the championship.\nThe Australian Grand Prix was contested by AF1 cars during the years 1970 to 1983 inclusive, although the 1970 event also permitted Formula 5000 cars and the 1981 race was restricted to cars complying with the Formula Pacific section of AF1."

        "title": "2015 Pan American Games",
        "text": "The 2015 Pan American Games (), officially the XVII Pan American Games and commonly known as the Toronto 2015 Pan-Am Games (), were a major international multi-sport event celebrated in the tradition of the Pan American Games, as governed by Pan American Sports Organization (PASO). The games were held from July 10 to 26, 2015 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; preliminary rounds in certain events began on July 7, 2015. These were the third Pan American Games hosted by Canada, and the first in the province of Ontario. The Games were held at venues in Toronto and 17 other Golden Horseshoe communities. The Pan American Games and 2015 Parapan American Games were organized by the Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games (TO2015).\nThe Games hosted 6,123 athletes and 3,396 team officials representing 41 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) in the Americas, marking the largest multi-sport event hosted in Canada, in terms of athletes competing. A record of 46 percent of competitors were women, the most ever for any multi-sport event. 364 events were contested in 36 sports, which included the 28 sports contested at the 2016 Summer Olympics; certain sports also served as qualification paths for these Olympics. Canoe slalom and golf made their Pan American Games debut, as well as women's competitions in baseball, canoeing and rugby sevens.\nIn 2019, the organizing committee reported that the games came in under budget by $38 million and left a strong legacy for the region with a legacy fund of over $60 million to maintain these structures for a twenty-year period after the Games were held (i.e., until 2035).\nToronto 2015 was largely seen as a precursor for a Toronto bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics, which never materialized (Paris will host the 2024 Summer Olympics instead). This would have been Toronto's sixth attempt at an Olympic bid.\nBidding process.\nThe Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) originally expressed interest in bidding for the games in November 2007. In April 2008, after discussions with all three levels of government, the COC chose to support Toronto and the surrounding region as the Canadian candidate. No other Canadian city was given a chance to bid in a domestic race, and thus Toronto was selected without a vote. Toronto's interest in bidding came after failing to land the 1996 Summer Olympics and the 2008 Summer Olympics, which were held in Atlanta and Beijing, respectively, instead.\nOn February 23, 2009, Toronto City Council and Hamilton City Council approved the bid and confirmed their intentions to support the successful hosting of the event. The official bid book document was submitted to the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) on May 27, 2009.\nPASO made an evaluation visit to Toronto between August 30 and 31, 2009. The team analysed the candidate city features and provided its feedback back to voting members of PASO. The evaluation committee was headed by Julio Maglione, a member of the IOC representing Uruguay and the head of Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA), the international swimming federation, later renamed World Aquatics in 2023. After the visit, Maglione said, \"Toronto has all the conditions to play host to the Pan American Games.\"\nHost city election.\nToronto won the bidding process to host the Pan and Parapan American Games by a vote of the Pan American Sports Organization on November 6, 2009, at the PASO Session held in Guadalajara, Mexico. The result was announced by PASO President Mario Vázquez Raña. Toronto faced two other finalists shortlisted Lima, Peru (which later won the rights to host the 2019 Pan American Games), and Bogotá, Colombia. Toronto earned 33 votes, while contesting candidate cities Lima and Bogotá received 11 and 7 votes, respectively. Then-Mayor of Toronto Rob Ford and Canadian Minister of Sport Bal Gosal received the Pan American Sports Organization flag during the closing ceremony of the 2011 Pan American Games in Guadalajara.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nVenues.\nThe 2015 Pan American Games used a mixture of new venues and existing and temporary facilities, some of them in well-known locations such as Exhibition Place. After the Games, some of the new facilities will be reused in their games time form, while others will be resized. A total of 30 competition venues across 14 municipalities were used for competition. Ten of these venues were newly built, while fifteen were renovated to stage the games.\nToronto was one of the most populous cities in history to hold the Pan American Games. In July, Toronto has an average mean temperature of and afternoon maximum average of The average humidity is 74 percent, and the city (downtown area) averages five days with the temperature exceeding and about of precipitation, mostly brief periods of showers and sometimes thunderstorms. Toronto's elevation is above sea level on average, though the city has many steep hills and deep ravines, the largest ravine system of any city in the world.\nIn January 2012, the Toronto Organizing Committee for the 2015 Pan and Parapan American Games (TO2015) announced that sixty percent of the venues that had been proposed would be dropped in favour of a clustering system seen at other multi-sport events such as the 2012 Summer Olympics in London.\nThe opening and closing ceremonies were held at Rogers Centre (renamed \"Pan Am Dome\" due to sponsorship rules). Some of the competition venues in the Toronto area included BMO Field (renamed \"Exhibition Stadium\" due to sponsorship rules), the Pan Am/Parapan Am Fields, the Enercare Centre and the Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre, while the road cycling and marathon events include High Park west of Exhibition Place. Competition venues outside Toronto city limits included Tim Hortons Field in Hamilton, Hershey Centre, Markham Pan Am Centre in Markham, the GM Centre in Oshawa, and the Royal Canadian Henley Rowing Course in St. Catharines.\nFinancing.\nThe Toronto 2015 Organizing Committee and three jurisdictions of government were to spend about million in upgrading and building new venues in the region. An additional million was to be spent in operating expenses such as venue management and marketing. The Canadian federal government was expected to provide million in funding for the games, while the City of Toronto's contribution was to be million. Other municipalities which are hosting sporting events were to cover million of the costs. All remaining costs were covered by the Government of Ontario. Revenue from the games were expected to cover ten percent of the cost to stage the games. The organizing committee expected to generate million in revenue. In addition, million was to be spent on building an athletes' village in the West Don Lands area of Toronto. A further million was budgeted on security, while transportation costs were around million. In 2014, the Ontario government provided an additional million to expand the torch relay, provide additional live broadcasting of events and other features. Therefore, the total spent was expected to be billion, the highest-ever cost of a single Pan Am Games.\nIn 2016, Ontario auditor-general Bonnie Lysyk issued a report suggesting that the games were over-budget by million. However, in 2019, the organizing committee found that the games were actually million under budget, and left a legacy of $60 million to continue to maintain the buildings and facilities built for the games.\nInfrastructure.\nThe Union Pearson Express, an airport rail link from Toronto Pearson International Airport to Union Station, started full-time service on June 6, 2015. The games created a deadline for a project that had been stalled for years. In addition, a new GO Transit train station in Hamilton at James Street North opened in time for the games.\nIn October 2013, an expansion of the Pan Am site was announced to help complete in gaps in Ontario's Trans Canada Trail and connect communities from Ottawa to Windsor and Fort Erie to Huntsville in time for the games. Connections to the Waterfront Trail were expected to be expanded and complete gaps in the trail. Premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne announced \"The province is investing more than  million in Pan Am/Parapan Am Trails to help create a continuous trail of more than .\"\nAthletes' Village.\nThe Athlete's village cost $735 million CAD and had the capacity to hold up to 7,200 athletes and officials. After the games, the village was converted to 746 market-priced condos, 41 market-priced town homes, 250 affordable-rent apartments, 257 student dormitory units for George Brown College, office and retail units, and a YMCA recreation centre. The Athlete's Village was located in the West Don Lands along Front Street between Bayview Avenue and Cherry Street in Toronto. The development was certified LEED Gold. Five satellite villages (all hotels and university residences) were also used to house athletes that were competing in venues far from the main village.\nVolunteers.\nThe organization committee expected 23,000 volunteers to be required for Pan Am and Parapan Am Games. Over 63,000 applicants applied to become a volunteer. A total of 16,146 volunteers participated as part of the Games.\nTicketing.\nTicket sales began on September 15, 2014 for high-demand events such as the ceremonies, via a lottery. Purchasers would find out if they received tickets in November 2014. General sales of tickets began on December 8, 2014. The Games had 1.4 million tickets for sale, with over 75 percent of them priced under . A special report from the Office of the Auditor General of Ontario concluded that \"TO2015 eventually sold over 1.1 million of the 1.4 million available tickets—over 1 million for the Pan Am Games (85 percent of the total available) and 89,000 for the Parapan American Games (49 percent of the total available).\"\nCountdown.\nThe one-year countdown took place in Nathan Phillips Square in Downtown Toronto on July 10, 2014, in which a countdown clock was unveiled. A Cirque du Soleil performance was also held there.\nMedals.\nIn October 2013, it was announced that the medals for the games would be produced and designed by the Royal Canadian Mint. In September 2014, it was announced that the supplier of the raw minerals used in the medals (over 4,000 in total) would be Toronto-based Barrick Gold. All the materials used in the medals will come from the company's operations in the Pan American region. The copper was mined at the company's Zaldivar mine in Chile, the silver at the Pueblo Viejo mine in the Dominican Republic and the gold was mined at the Hemlo mine in northwestern Ontario in the Unorganized Thunder Bay District near Thunder Bay.\nThe designs of the medals were revealed on March 3, 2015 at a ceremony at the Royal Ontario Museum. The design of the medals for the first time in an international able-bodied multi-sport event included braille. The medals are roughly in diameter and weigh about . The artist of the medals is Christi Belcourt, a Métis visual artist and author. There are three shapes on the front of the medal representing North America, Central America and the Caribbean, and South America, the three regions that competed at the games, while also giving a feel and texture of the medal podium. The back of the medal represents the logo and motto of the games and the design also includes elements and techniques of mokume-gane that gives the medals the appearance of having wood grain.\nTorch relay.\nAn application period for Canadians to carry the torch opened in October 2014 and continued until December. Anyone aged 13 years or older as of May 30, 2015 was eligible to become a torchbearer. Most of the torchbearers were selected by a random selection, while the others were selected by torch relay communities and games partners.\nThe torch took a 41-day journey after being lit in May 2015 at the pyramids of Teotihuacan, Mexico State north of Mexico City. The torch was brought through a total of 130 communities, mostly in Ontario (with five outside the province: Richmond, Winnipeg, Calgary, Halifax and Montreal). The torch was carried by about 3,000 torchbearers and travelled approximately . The relay began on May 30, 2015 in Toronto and finished on July 10, the date of the opening ceremony.\nThe detailed torch relay route and celebration sites were announced on February 24, 2015. The torch arrived in Toronto and then headed to Thunder Bay before visiting all other communities on the route. The relay also visited five National Historic Sites of Canada, six Canadian Forces bases and one provincial park. There were 180 celebrations across the torch relay route.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony of the 2015 Pan American Games took place on Friday, July 10, 2015, beginning at 8:00 p.m. EDT at Rogers Centre. The opening ceremony was produced and directed by Cirque du Soleil. The production became the largest event produced by the company.\nGovernor General David Johnston officially opened the games. Meanwhile, basketball player Steve Nash was the person who lit the cauldron. Nash ran outside the stadium at the end of the ceremony, where he ignited a bowl, which transferred the fire to the official cauldron. The ceremony concluded with a fireworks display shot off the CN Tower, and all the performers back on stage to celebrate.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony took place on Sunday July 26, 2015, beginning at 8:00 p.m. EDT at Rogers Centre. The closing ceremony was produced and directed jointly by B5C Productions, BaAM Productions and FiveCurrents, in association with Live Nation. It featured cultural presentations and the formal handover to Lima, host of the 2019 Pan American Games. The ceremony featured a closing concert headlined by American rapper and music producer Kanye West, joined by Pitbull, and Canadian musician Serena Ryder.\nThe choice of West as a headliner was criticized by Mayor John Tory and other residents, who argued that it should have been headlined by a Canadian musician.\nParticipating nations.\nAll 41 nations of PASO competed, one fewer than in the 2011 Pan American Games, as the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee was dissolved in 2011.\nSports.\nA total of 36 sports, 51 disciplines and 364 medal events were contested in these Games. A record 19 sports were direct or indirect (such as opportunities to gain qualification times) qualifiers for the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nBasque pelota was the only sport dropped from the last games. Golf also made its Pan American Games debut, ahead of its reintroduction at Rio 2016. Canoe slalom, the only Olympic discipline never to have been held at the Games, also made its debut, meaning for the first time the entire Olympic sports program was contested. Furthermore, both canoe disciplines had C-1 events for women for the first time. Women's baseball and women's rugby sevens also made their debuts, with men's softball returning to the program, after last being contested in 2003. \n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events to be contested in each sport/discipline.\"\nCalendar.\nIn the following calendar of events, each blue box represents an event competition, such as a qualification round, on that day. The yellow boxes represent days during which medal-awarding finals for a sport were held. The number in each box represents the number of finals that were contested on that day. Events began three days before the opening ceremony on July 7 and ended with the closing ceremony on July 26.\nMedal table.\nThe United States won the most medals with a total of 265. Canada, the host country, won 219 medals. Other notable mentions include Saint Lucia winning its first Pan American gold medal.\nMedia.\nAccreditation.\nA total of 1,232 media personnel were accredited with covering the games, including broadcast, press and photographers.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) served as the host and domestic broadcaster of the 2015 Pan American Games; locally, coverage was broadcast in the English and French languages by CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé, and CBC's website carried 650 hours of online coverage. Pay television rights were sub-licensed to Sportsnet, which aired the football (soccer) tournaments, and a semi-final of the Men's basketball tournament that involved Canada. Spanish language rights were sub-licensed to Telelatino and Univision Canada; the broadcaster collaborated with US Spanish-language rights-holder ESPN Deportes on its own coverage. CBC stated that it was \"very happy\" with the ratings performance of the Games; primetime coverage averaged around 900,000 to 1 million viewers per night, and the opening ceremonies were seen by 1.93 million viewers across CBC and CBC News Network, with the largest audience being in the Toronto region.\nIn the United States, ESPN held broadcast rights, with 66 hours of English-language coverage across ESPN and ESPN2, 44 hours on Longhorn Network, 200 hours of Spanish-language coverage on ESPN Deportes, and streaming on WatchESPN. ESPN broadcast from studios at Corus Quay, which was linked to the IBC (and in turn, ESPN's headquarters in Bristol, Connecticut). ESPN and ESPN Deportes used their own hosts, as well as those of CBC, as part of its multi-platform coverage.\nRede Record acquired rights in Brazil, paying a record US$30 million. Other broadcasting deals include Torneos y Competencias sports in Argentina, Claro Sports in Mexico and Latina Televisión in Peru.\nMarketing.\nLogo.\nToronto's bid logo was launched on October 2, 2008, with the then–Toronto mayor David Miller and then-head of the organizing committee David Peterson unveiling the logo to the public. The bid logo looks like an abstract maple leaf with three sections, each section made up of two strokes in the shape of a \"v\" with a spot in the centre. The colours are green, red and blue. This was the official logo of the games until 2010, when the new logo was launched.\nOn September 29, 2010, the official logo of the games was unveiled at a street party at Maple Leaf Square. According to Ian Troop, the former chief executive officer of Toronto 2015 organizing committee, the logo is designed on the basis of the different art styles seen throughout the 41 countries that compete at the games.\nMascot.\nIn January 2013, it was announced that a contest would determine the mascot of the games. Children under the age of 16 had until March 8, 2013 to submit their ideas. 4,000 ideas and drawings were submitted to the organizing committee during this time frame. In April 2013, a shortlist of six mascot designs (which were produced by professional graphic designers with the sketches by the children as models) were released, including a raccoon, beaver, moose, two pixie creature twins, porcupine and an owl. The final six were selected based on originality, how well they represent Canadian culture and the branding of the Games, and the appeal they had amongst adults and children. On April 22, 2013, the general public was allowed to vote for the mascot they felt was the best. Voting was open until May 5, 2013.\nOn July 17, 2013, Pachi the Porcupine was revealed as the official mascot of the games at an unveiling at the Canadian Broadcasting Centre. The mascot received over 33,000 votes from the nationwide vote. The winning design was submitted by four Grade-Eight students at Buttonville Public School in Markham. The name Pachi (ぱち) means \"clapping with joy\" in Japanese, while the 41 quills the porcupine has represent the 41 participating countries at the games. \"The New York Times\" described the mascot as \"a departure from the usual cute and cuddly\" and \"a marketing challenge\". The Games licensed \"Inner Ninja\" by rapper Classified as Pachi's theme song.\nMusic.\nThe event's official theme song was released in three versions: the English-language \"Together We Are One\", performed by Serena Ryder; the French \"Ensemble on est immense\", performed by Jasmine Denham; and the Spanish \"Unidos Somos Más\", performed by Eva Avila.\nToronto Sign.\nA large, illuminated \"Toronto\" sculpture sign installed in Nathan Phillips Square for the Games proved to be popular with locals and tourists as a spot for photos, and it came to become a symbol of the renewed enthusiasm surrounding the Pan Am Games. Considering it a symbol of their legacy, Mayor of Toronto John Tory solicited suggestions for a permanent location for the sign following the Games. It was later announced that the sign would remain in the Square in its current form through at least the end of 2016 and later extended to the end of 2017 with the temporary addition of a maple leaf for the 150th anniversary of Canadian confederation and 2018 with a medicine wheel. In September 2020, the sign was replaced with a new version, adding weatherproofing and an updated lighting system.\nSponsorship.\nPrivate sponsors included Chevrolet Canada. Another sponsorship deal with CAA South Central Ontario announced in January 2014 was terminated in May 2014.\nConcerns and controversies.\nScheduling.\nThe aquatics events at the 2015 Pan American Games were scheduled to be held roughly around the same time as the 2015 World Aquatics Championships scheduled in Kazan, Russia. In order to maintain the quality of its fields, the schedule of the five aquatics disciplines had to be changed to accommodate athletes. The synchronized swimming competition was moved to the day before the opening ceremony, diving events began on the day of the opening ceremony (when events are traditionally not held on the day of the ceremony), open water swimming was moved to the first weekend of the games, swimming was reduced to a five-day schedule (down from seven in 2011), and water polo competitions began three days before the opening ceremony. All events were scheduled to be completed by July 24, six days before the opening ceremonies of the World Championships, which in itself was moved back a week to accommodate the games. The change in schedule meant that for the first time, events were held before the opening ceremony.\nThe 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, which was held in various Canadian cities, concluded on the Sunday prior to the opening ceremony; due to the proximity of the events, teams who competed in both the Women's World Cup and the Pan Am women's football tournament were not expected to field their best players due to availability. Toronto decided not to bid to host matches during the Women's World Cup due to a potential conflict with the Games.\nThe 2015 World Archery Championships were scheduled later in July, to avoid conflict with the games, while the 2015 World Fencing Championships (which finished one day prior to the start of fencing competitions at the Pan-Am Games) were coordinated to allow athletes to compete at both events. Finally, the second round of the 2015 Davis Cup was moved ahead one week to avoid conflict with the tennis competitions. Tennis competitions were held before the opening ceremony, to allow athletes to compete in both events.\nThe volleyball tournaments and the FIVB Volleyball World Grand Prix and the FIVB Volleyball World League were played at roughly the same time, leading to scheduling conflicts for teams playing both events.\nThe IndyCar Series' Honda Indy Toronto race (later renamed Grand Prix of Toronto), which is held on a street circuit at Exhibition Place, was moved to June from July to avoid conflicting with the Games.\nExpenses claims.\nIn September 2013, it was reported that many senior members of the organizing committee, including then-CEO Ian Troop, expensed Ontario taxpayers for things such as a cup of tea. This led to outrage among provincial politicians including Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, \"I'm just going to say it's ridiculous. It is the kind of entitlement that is unacceptable\". In response to the backlash the organization released an updated expenses and travel policy in November 2013. In December 2013, Troop was ousted by the organization's board of directors, just three months after the expense scandal came into light. He was replaced by Saad Rafi. In 2014, more expenses by the organization came under scrutiny including boxes of South American wine.\nIn 2015, Ian Troop, the former CEO, gave an interview in which he stated that organizers cleared him from any wrongdoing, and that all expenses fell under the organization's policy. Troop also mentioned under his leadership the organization saved million from the capital infrastructure budget. Troop's firing had nothing to do with the expenses scandal that arose in 2013.\nExecutive compensation and bonuses.\nThe games' organizing committee came under scrutiny for the high compensation and bonus packages its executive team has been awarded. Under Ontario's Salary Disclosure rules, any provincial employee receiving over in compensation will have their salary publicly disclosed. In 2012, it was revealed that former CEO Ian Troop made , with several other senior staff making between and . Additionally, in 2013 it was revealed that as part of his compensation package, Troop would be eligible for a bonus at the end of his contract, if the games had finished successfully. Other executives are eligible for bonuses of up to 100 percent of their salaries upon completion of their contract. In 2015, it was revealed that Troop's replacement, Saad Rafi, would receive a bonus of 100 percent of his salary upon completion of his contract. Rafi did not collect his bonus at the conclusion of the games.\nCanadian television coverage.\nAlthough still billed as having been the most extensive television coverage of the Pan American Games ever broadcast in the country, the CBC faced criticism for the amount of coverage it produced and broadcast from the 2015 Pan American Games. Only condensed, tape-delayed highlights of events aired on CBC Television, drawing comparisons to the similar practices imposed by NBC's coverage of the Olympics. Most events were streamed online, and pay television channel Sportsnet aired the soccer tournaments on television, but events in some sports received only limited online coverage or were not broadcast at all. Partway through the Games, the CBC expanded its primetime coverage block, while broadcasts of a semi-final game in men's basketball on Sportsnet and the baseball finals online were added at the last minute. Critics perceived these last-minute changes as signs that the CBC had underestimated viewer interest in the Pan Am Games.\nCBC Sports head of programming Trevor Pilling explained that the large number of events being held, along with the stature of the Pan American Games in comparison to the Olympics, were a factor in the structure of CBC's coverage, stating that \"I do think we are the victim of our own success in that having Olympic coverage that is around the clock, but the Olympics are a different event than these Pan Am Games. But I feel like we've done the athletes justice by telling those stories or through live coverage, or with reporters on site. We've tried to make sure we're at all the significant events, and with Canada winning over 180 medals, that's a tall task.\"\nWhile the \"National Post\" also felt that budget cuts faced by the CBC in recent years, including those imposed following the loss of its national broadcast rights to the National Hockey League to Rogers Media, may have also had an impact—with a CBC spokesperson arguing that \"resources\" were a factor, Pilling denied that this was the case, arguing that it was \"about the planning, It is about making good, sound business decisions\", and promised that there would be extensive coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro."

In 1916 he was recruited by American League president Ban Johnson and his secretary, Bob McRoy, to head up a syndicate to buy the Cleveland Indians baseball team from Charles Somers for $500,000. \nDuring his tenure the team's ballpark League Park was renamed \"Dunn Field\" and in 1920 the Indians won their first World Series. At his death at Chicago in 1922 at age 57, control of the team passed to his surviving spouse, Edith Dunn, and his estate, thus making Mrs. Dunn one of the first women to own a major league baseball team. In 1927 ownership of the Indians changed hands when Dunn's widow Edith, by then known as Mrs. George Pross, sold the franchise for $1 million to a group headed by Alva Bradley."

        "title": "John Johnstone (baseball)",
        "text": "John William Johnstone (born November 25, 1968) is an American former professional baseball pitcher.\nCareer.\nMinor leagues.\nJohnstone was chosen in the 20th round of the 1987 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets. He joined the Kingsport Mets in the rookie-level Appalachian League for the remainder of the season after his selection, and went 1-1 with a 7.45 ERA with a 2.14 WHIP over 17 games. The following season he remained at the rookie level, and played for the Gulf Coast League Mets. He improved his ERA to 2.68, going 3-4 with a 2.69 ERA and a 1.22 WHIP.\nIn 1989, Johnstone played with the Pittsfield Mets in the single-A New York-Penn League, posting an 11-2 record, a 2.77 ERA, and a 1.24 WHIP. In 1990 he was promoted to the high-A St. Lucie Mets in the Florida State League, where he went 15-6 with a 2.24 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP.\nIn 1991 and 1992, Johnstone played at the double-A level in the Eastern League, first with the Williamsport Bills (27 starts, 7-9, 3.97, 165.1 IP, 100 SO, 1.44 WHIP), then with the Binghamton Mets (24 starts, 7-7, 2.75, 149.1 IP, 121 SO, 1.13 WHIP). After the season, he was drafted by the Marlins with the 31st pick in the expansion draft.\nMLB career.\nJohnstone started out the 1993 season with the triple-A Edmonton Trappers, going 4-15 with a 5.18 ERA and a 1.57 WHIP in the Pacific Coast League. Despite these alarming figures, Florida called him up to join the parent club for the last month of the inaugural season. On September 3, he made his MLB debut and took the loss, allowing an earned run in the 13th inning of a 5–4 decision against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He totaled 10.2 innings for the Fish, striking out five and allowing 16 hits and seven walks. He had a 5.91 ERA and a 2.156 WHIP to go with his 0-2 record.\nIn 1994, Johnstone played most of the campaign back in Edmonton, going 5-3 with a 4.46 ERA in 29 games, striking out 43 in 42.1 innings along with a much improved 1.30 WHIP. He joined the Marlins in late-June and stayed with Florida through mid-August. He did not allow an earned run through his first seven appearances, spanning eight innings. Opponents during that streak hit just .107 against him, with a .372 OPS. He had an enviable 0.303 WHIP during that stretch. He earned his first career win on July 1 when he pitched the 10th and 11th inning of a 4-3 win over the Atlanta Braves, striking out two and allowing zero hits. In total, he pitched in 17 games for the Marlins, going 1-2 with a 5.91 ERA, a 1.828 WHIP, and 23 strikeouts in 21.1 innings.\nIn 1995, Johnstone appeared in four games for the Marlins near the beginning of the season, and give up two earned runs over 4.2 innings. He strained his right elbow and was out for the season on May 8, and the Marlins granted his free agency after the season closed. He signed on with the Houston Astros a few days later.\nJohnstone labored at the triple-A level with the PCL's Tucson Toros in 1996, putting up a 3-3 record and a 3.42 ERA in 45 games. He appeared in nine games with the Astros in the middle of the season, earning a 1-0 record and allowing 17 hits in 13 innings with a 5.54 ERA.\nIn 1997, Johnstone signed a free agent contract to play with the San Francisco Giants. Most of his time in the organization would see him with the Phoenix Firebirds in the PCL. He played 38 games in Phoenix, going 0-3, 4.03 over 38 innings. He spent the month of July with San Francisco, getting into 10 games and racking up a 2.16 ERA over 16.2 innings, with 14 strikeouts and a 1.080 WHIP. The Giants waived him on August 7, and he joined the Oakland Athletics. After five appearances over three weeks (6.1 innings, 2.84 ERA, 2.211 WHIP), he was again granted free agency, and signed back on with the Giants. He got into three more games that season for San Francisco, pitching two innings.\nIn 1998, Johnstone appeared in a career-high and team-second 70 games, going 6-5 with a 3.07 ERA and a 1.250 WHIP, striking out 86 in 88 innings. He earned an opening day victory on March 31, pitching two shutout innings at the end of a 12-inning 9-4 win over the Houston Astros. On June 9, he struck out three in 1.2 shutout innings, earning another win in a 7-6 triumph over the Seattle Mariners.\nJohnstone went 4-6 with a 2.60 ERA in 1999 for the Giants, appearing in 62 contests and striking out 56 in 65.2 innings. He logged a career best 1.036 WHIP. He did not allow an earned run through his first 15 appearances, a span lasting 13.2 innings. Opponents hit just .133 over that time, and struck out nine times. On July 22, he struck out five of the six batters he faced in the seventh and eighth inning of an 8-7 loss to the San Diego Padres. He pitched three perfect innings, striking out two on July 25 in a 13-innings, 2-1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds.\nIn 2000, Johnstone played in 47 games for the Giants, going 3-4 with a 6.30 ERA and a 1.540 WHIP. He landed on the DL in mid-July for a back injury, eventually getting surgery and effectively ending his career.\nLater life.\nJohnstone was the varsity baseball head coach at his alma mater, Bishop Ludden Jr./Sr. High School, from 2016 to 2018.\nIn 2012, Johnstone was inducted into the Greater Syracuse Sports Hall of Fame."

It consisted of 19 stages covering a total of , and was won by Bernard Hinault of the Renault–Elf–Gitane cycling team. \nThe foreign favourites for the race included Bernard Hinault who had won the Vuelta once before in 1978 and World Champion Giuseppe Saronni. The Spanish favourites for the race included the de facto defending champion Marino Lejarreta, Julián Gorospe and Alberto Fernández.\nHinault took the leadership of the race after the fifth stage only to lose it the following day to Lejarreta. Lejarreta then won the stage 8 mountain time trial and increased his lead over Hinault. On the stage from Zaragoza to Soria that was won by Saronni, Lejarreta had a fall and lost the jersey to Gorospe. Fernández took the leadership the following day. Lejarreta came back and won the stage 13 to Lagos de Covadonga. However Fernández kept the leader's jersey. On the following stage Álvaro Pino took the jersey and wore it for two days. Hinault won the individual time trial but did not win by enough time to take the jersey which passed again to Gorospe. Two days later Hinault's pace on the climb to Puerto de Serranillos was too hot for his opponents and he won the stage in Ávila and took back the leader's jersey to win his second Vuelta and his eighth grand tour with Lejarreta second and Fernández in third. The great battle waged between Hinault and the Spanish riders has led to the 1983 race being described as its most spectacular edition. In addition to this the start list for the 1983 Renault team at the Vuelta included Hinault, Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon, the only time they rode on the same team in a Grand Tour.\nThis victory proved costly for Hinault however, as due to a recurrent tendinitis issue that had developed in his knee, which he greatly aggravated on the climb to Puerto de Serranillos, Hinault was unable to ride in that year's Tour, where Fignon took over Team Renault."

        "text": "The 37th Edition Vuelta a España (Tour of Spain), a long-distance bicycle stage race and one of the three grand tours, was held from 20 April to 9 May 1982. It consisted of 19 stages covering a total of , and was won by Marino Lejarreta of the Teka cycling team.\nThe Reynolds team controlled the race after team leader Ángel Arroyo took the leader's jersey on the tenth stage. Arroyo kept the jersey until the finish of the race where he won the final individual time trial. Arroyo won the grand tour ahead of Marino Lejarreta and Michel Pollentier. However 48 hours after his win, it emerged that in the doping control that was conducted after the stage 17 Arroyo tested positive. Three other riders also failed the doping test after stage 17: Alberto Fernández, Vicente Belda and Pedro Muñoz.\nThe four riders were said to have tested positive for Methylphenidate (which is also known as Ritalin) a stimulant. Methylphenidate was a popular drug for doping in cycling at that time.\nArroyo and his team denied the allegations and asked for a second analysis of the sample. The B analysis confirmed the first positive test. \nArroyo was assigned a 10-minute penalty and stripped of his Vuelta win which was given to Lejarreta. With the 10-minute penalty Arroyo went down to 13th place in the classification. \nThe disqualification of the winner of the Vuelta has been called the worst scandal that has ever hit the race on the official La Vuelta website."

        "title": "National Clarion Cycling Club",
        "text": "The National Clarion Cycling Club is a British cycling club founded in 1894, and which retained strong links with the labour movement through the 20th century. At its peak, in 1936, it had 233 UK sections and 8,306 members. In 2021, it replaced its “support for the principles of socialism” with support for “fairness, equality, inclusion and diversity”. Today it has some 30 member sections across Great Britain and over 1,900 members.\nHistory.\nClarion Cycling Clubs.\nThe first club was formed in February 1894 in Birmingham, England as the Socialists' Cycling Club. At its second meeting it renamed itself the Clarion Cycling Club after \"The Clarion\" socialist newspaper. This was at the peak of the bicycle boom, when the old penny farthing had been swept away by the new safety bicycle, the diamond-frame design widely used today.\nBy the end of 1894, readers of \"The Clarion\" formed local socialist cycling clubs in five industrial centres: Birmingham, The Potteries, Liverpool, Bradford and Barnsley.\nIn 1895 at Ashbourne, Derbyshire the five clubs gathered for their first annual Easter Meet. Together they formed the National Clarion Cycling Club, which is\n\"the association of the various Clarion Cycling Clubs for the purpose of Socialist propaganda and for promoting inter-club runs between the clubs of different towns\".\nClarion Scouts.\nIn 1894 a writer in the \"Clarion\" under the pen-name \"Numquam\" suggested a \"cycling corps of \"Clarion\" Scouts\". That summer, a meeting between The Potteries and Birmingham Clarion Clubs decided to put it into effect: \"scouts\" using their cycling trips to circulate socialist leaflets and copies of the \"Clarion\" wherever they visited.\nIn November 1894, members of the Bradford and Liverpool CCC's campaigned for socialist candidates in local council elections. By the end of that year, 22 of the Bradford CCC's 25 members were working as Scouts, distributing propaganda to villages around the town. In March 1895 a new socialist magazine, \"The Scout\", was launched for Scouts to read and circulate. It was subtitled \"A Monthly Journal for Socialists\" and its first edition included a set of \"Instructions for Scouts\" written by \"The Clarion\"s editor Robert Blatchford. The Clarion Clubs also did much to circulate \"The Clarion\", Blatchford's book \"Merrie England\" and the socialist ideas that they expressed.\nWhen the Clarion Clubs were formed, socialists in Britain were divided between the Social Democratic Federation founded in 1881, the Independent Labour Party founded in 1893 and smaller organisations. The Labour Representation Committee that evolved into the current Labour Party was not founded until 1900. Clarion Scouts were encouraged to support either SDF or ILP candidates in elections, and Scouts in districts that lacked local socialist groups were encouraged to form either a local group of either SDF or the ILP, and to build unity between the disparate organisations of Britain's labour movement.\nThe number of local Clarion Clubs/sections grew to 30 by the end of 1895, including London Clarion Cycle Club, and 70 by the early part of 1897. They reached the peak of their extent and influence in 1914, when their Easter Meet was at Shrewsbury. The illustrator and socialist Walter Crane designed the National Clarion Cycle Club's letterhead.\nThe Clarion membership reached its peak in 1936, with 233 sections across the UK and 8,306 members. At that time they had an educational scheme within the National Council of Labour Colleges.\nMembership then fell, to 5000 by 1951, 4000 by 1953, 3000 by 1957, 2000 by 1961 and 1000 by 1965. From 2000, the Clarion limped along with only 500-600 members until 2010, when sections were urged to support youth development, and new sections were encouraged. This coincided with a UK 'golden era' of international cycling success; it had 1,300 members in 30 sections in 2014, and by the end of 2017 membership reached 1,895 members.\nModern Clarion movement.\nSince 2007, the Clarion Cycling Club has doubled its membership to over 2,000 members across some 14 sections. In 2024, the club had active sections in Brighton &amp; Hove, Cotswold, Fenland, Heanor, Gosport, Ironbridge, Lancashire (Barnoldswick, Blackpool, Clitheroe), Greater Manchester (Bolton, Bury, Manchester, Saddleworth, Stockport), London Clarion Cycle Club, North Cheshire, Nottinghamshire (Nottingham, Tuxford), Scotland (Coatbridge, West Lothian), Sunderland, Teesside, and Yorkshire (Calder, Yorkshire Coast). A 'private' membership category caters for members who do not live close to a regional section or who do not want to join a local club.\nToday the Clarion stands less for political activism and more for all forms of cycle activities, including cycle touring, sportives, time trials, road, track and cyclo-cross racing. The staple diet of the Clarion cyclist is the club run, an organised group ride, usually at a weekend, covering distances from 20 miles to over 100 miles in a day.\nThe club has a biannual newsletter, \"Boots and Spurs\", and holds an annual conference.\nIn June 2021, an AGM of the National Clarion Club voted to remove a reference to socialism from its constitution. A majority of members felt it was \"divisive and non-inclusive\". Two-thirds voted to replace “support for the principles of socialism” with support for “fairness, equality, inclusion and diversity”. Critics accused the club of \"trying to erase history\" and warned the step may lead to a breakaway organisation.\nSplintering.\nConcerns about dilution of the Clarion's political aims had already created splinter clubs. In 2006 the National Clarion Cycling Club 1895 (North Lancs Union) was formed as a breakaway group from the original National Clarion CC. According to the splinter organisation's secretary Charles Jepson, writing in 2021, it was established \"to protect the (original National Clarion CC) founders' commitment to 'combine the pleasures of cycling with the propaganda of socialism'\".\nSporting successes and champions.\nThe Clarion has several champions among its membership including:"

        "text": "Elections to the Baseball Hall of Fame for 2009 proceeded according to revised rules enacted in 2001 and further revamped in 2007. The Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA) held an election to select from among recent players, and elected Jim Rice and Rickey Henderson.\nIn keeping with the 2007 rules changes, the Veterans Committee held an election for players who were active in the years 1943 to 1987, but not before or after that period; for the fourth consecutive election cycle, this election produced no selections. An election to select from among players who were active prior to 1943 was conducted by a separate Veterans Committee panel of 12 Hall of Famers, writers, and baseball historians, chosen by the Hall of Fame's Board of Directors, and this election produced the first player selection by the Veterans Committee since 2001, Joe Gordon. An election to select managers, umpires and executives had been held for the 2008 inductions; the next such election was held prior to the 2010 inductions.\nInduction ceremonies in Cooperstown were held July 26, 2009, with Commissioner Bud Selig presiding.\nBBWAA election.\nThe BBWAA was again authorized to elect players active in 1989 or later, but not after 2003; the ballot, announced on December 1, 2008, included candidates from the 2008 ballot who received at least 5% of the vote but were not elected, along with selected players, chosen by a screening committee, whose last appearance was in 2003. All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to vote; ballots had to be returned by December 31.\nVoters were instructed to cast votes for up to 10 candidates; any candidate who received votes on at least 75% of the ballots would be honored with induction to the Hall. Results of the 2009 election by the BBWAA were announced on January 12. The ballot consisted of 23 players, the lowest number ever; there were 13 candidates returning from the 2008 ballot, also a record low.\n539 ballots were cast (including two ballots which supported no candidates), with 405 votes required for election. A total of 2,902 individual votes were cast, an average of 5.38 per ballot. Those candidates who received less than 5% of the vote will not appear on future BBWAA ballots, but may eventually be considered by the Veterans Committee.\nCandidates who were eligible for the first time are indicated here with a dagger (†). The candidates who received at least 75% of the vote and were elected are indicated in bold italics; candidates who have since been selected in subsequent elections are indicated in \"italics\". The candidates who received less than 5% of the vote, thus becoming ineligible for future BBWAA consideration, are indicated with an asterisk (*).\nTommy John and Jim Rice were on the ballot for the 15th and final time; Rice became the first player elected in his final year of BBWAA ballot eligibility since Ralph Kiner in , while John's eligibility ran out.\nThe newly eligible candidates included 22 All-Stars (12 of whom were not included on the ballot), who were selected a combined total of 58 times – a slight increase from 2008, when 17 All-Stars who had been selected a total of 43 times became eligible. Rickey Henderson, a 10-time All-Star, was the only new candidate who was selected more than five times. The ballot included two MVPs (Henderson and Mo Vaughn), and one Cy Young Award-winner and perfect game thrower (David Cone), none of them winning more than once.\nPlayers eligible for the first time who were \"not\" included on the ballot were: Steve Avery, Jason Bere, Mike Bordick, John Burkett, Omar Daal, Joe Girardi, Mark Guthrie, Joey Hamilton, Bill Haselman, Darren Holmes, Trenidad Hubbard, Todd Hundley, Brian L. Hunter, Félix José, Chad Kreuter, Graeme Lloyd, Keith Lockhart, Albie Lopez, Pat Mahomes, Al Martin, Orlando Merced, Charles Nagy, Denny Neagle, Troy O'Leary, Lance Painter, Dean Palmer, Craig Paquette, Tom Prince, Jeff Reboulet, Rick Reed, Rich Rodriguez, Terry Shumpert, Luis Sojo, Dave Veres, Matt Walbeck, Mike Williams and Kevin Young.\nNone of the newly eligible candidates would appear on any future ballots. As expected, Henderson was elected on his first appearance; no other first-timer received the 5% of votes required to remain on the ballot. As a result, the 2010 ballot broke the record set this year for fewest returning candidates, with only 11 players returning.\nVeterans Committee.\n1943 and later.\nRules for election by the Veterans Committee were revised in July 2007 following complaints that the three elections conducted under the previous format (in 2003, 2005, and 2007) had resulted in no selections. After the February 2007 election, Bud Selig expressed frustration over the ongoing difficulties, and voiced his support for a revision of the process. Under the revised format, a Historical Overview Committee composed of 11 sportswriters appointed by the BBWAA's Board of Directors met in spring 2008 to develop a ballot of 20 former players active between 1943 and 1987; the committee members were: Dave Van Dyck (\"Chicago Tribune\"); Bob Elliott (\"Toronto Sun\"); Rick Hummel (\"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\"); Steve Hirdt (Elias Sports Bureau); Moss Klein (formerly Newark \"Star-Ledger\"); Bill Madden (New York \"Daily News\"); Ken Nigro (formerly \"Baltimore Sun\"); Jack O'Connell (MLB.com); Nick Peters (\"The Sacramento Bee\"); Tracy Ringolsby (\"Rocky Mountain News\"); and Mark Whicker (\"The Orange County Register\"). A six-member panel of Hall of Famers also met to independently select five players for consideration; these lists were merged to create a preliminary ballot of 21 names: Dick Allen, Ken Boyer, Bert Campaneris, Rocky Colavito, Mike Cuellar, Steve Garvey, Gil Hodges, Jim Kaat, Ted Kluszewski, Mickey Lolich, Roger Maris, Lee May, Minnie Miñoso, Thurman Munson, Tony Oliva, Al Oliver, Vada Pinson, Ron Santo, Luis Tiant, Joe Torre and Maury Wills.\nFollowing the elections of 2003 through 2007, when the voting membership of the Veterans Committee included not only the living members of the Hall but also recipients of the Ford C. Frick Award and J. G. Taylor Spink Award, voting was now limited to Hall members; they met at the Hall during induction weekend in 2008, and reduced the ballot to 10 names through voting by mail in August. This final ballot was then sent to the 64 living members, and they voted by mail, casting votes for up to four candidates each. Any candidate receiving votes on 75% of ballots would be inducted to the Hall; a maximum of five inductees was possible. The final ballot was announced on September 16; all ten finalists were returnees from the 2007 final ballot. Results were announced on December 8 at Major League Baseball's winter meetings in Las Vegas, Nevada, but no candidate received the necessary number of votes. All 64 eligible voters cast ballots, with 48 votes required for election. Players elected in subsequent years are indicated in \"plain italics\".\nA total of 213 votes were cast for the 10 candidates, an average of 3.33 votes per ballot cast, suggesting that most voters cast votes for the maximum number of candidates but that the votes were too scattered for any one candidate to reach the required number. Although Hall of Fame officials had hoped that reducing the field of candidates on the final ballot from approximately 25 names to 10 would help focus attention on the most popular candidates and increase the chances of a selection, the coinciding move to reduce the allowable number of votes per ballot from ten to four appeared to counteract any potential benefit, as every candidate but one saw his percentage of the vote drop from 2007 (Tiant improved slightly from 18.3% to 20.3%).\nHall of Fame chairwoman Jane Forbes Clark stated, \"When our board of directors restructured the Veterans Committee after the 2007 election, it did so with the goal of ensuring the voters – the living Hall of Famers – would review their peers. The 10 post-1942 ballot finalists all spent a substantial part of their playing career in the 1960s or the 1970s, and a vast majority of the voters were either actively playing, managing or involved in baseball in those two decades.\" She added, \"The process was not redesigned with the goal of necessarily electing someone, but to give everyone on the ballot a very fair chance of earning election through a ballot of their peers. The vote reinforces the selections of the Baseball Writers' Association of America and maintains the high standards set by the BBWAA. A 75-percent threshold is extremely difficult to attain, but the highly selective process helps ensure that enshrinement in the Baseball Hall of Fame remains the greatest honor in the game.\"\nFormer manager Dick Williams, who had been inducted into the Hall earlier in the year, noted, \"It's not our job to vote someone in,\" and added, \"It's our job to consider the candidates.\" Noting his support for some of the candidates, he stated, \"I thought Kaat would get in. I voted for him. And I think Joe Torre will, too, when he's done managing. I missed quite a few times before I got in. I know what that's like.\"\nIn announcing the lack of selections from this ballot, Hall president Jeff Idelson noted that the Hall's board of directors would review the results at its annual spring meeting, in keeping with their regular practice, and consider whether to further alter the selection process; he stressed that this was the first use of the new process featuring a smaller voting body and a reduced ballot. He added that the voting levels indicated that the members believed there were worthy candidates for induction, although no agreement could be reached as to the best ones. Hall member Joe Morgan, also a member of the Hall's board, argued that the current members were not trying to keep candidates out, but observed that the addition of strong new candidates each election might have the effect of reducing the support for any single player.\nThe ballot was composed almost entirely of players who were active in the 1960s and 1970s, with all but Hodges being active during the period from 1967 to 1972 (Hodges was a manager in that time period); even among the 21 players initially considered, only six had their rookie seasons before 1958, and only Hodges, Ted Kluszewski and Minnie Miñoso debuted before 1955. Other players who were on the 2007 ballot who were eligible for consideration were Bobby Bonds, Curt Flood, Sparky Lyle and Don Newcombe. In addition to Ken Boyer, Rocky Colavito, Kluszewski, Roger Maris, Miñoso and Newcombe, other potential candidates whose rookie seasons were before 1958 were Billy Pierce, perhaps the American League's top pitcher in the mid-1950s, Roy Face, the National League's first great reliever, and Dick Groat, a solid-hitting shortstop who was the NL's MVP in 1960.\nAmong the players who were eligible for the first time were Dusty Baker, Vida Blue, Ron Cey, Cecil Cooper, George Foster, Steve Garvey, Bobby Grich, Dave Kingman, Davey Lopes and Bill Madlock, with only Garvey being included among the 21 semifinalists.\nIn addition to improving on the fruitless outcome of the previous three elections for players, there may have been particular urgency in the 2009 vote resulting in the selection of one or more new members, as in 2011 a large group of potentially popular candidates would become eligible – possibly further diluting the support for any single candidate. Under the then-current Veterans Committee rules, those becoming eligible in 2011 would have included Buddy Bell, Dave Concepción, Ron Guidry, Tommy John, Graig Nettles and Ted Simmons; another sizable group of potentially popular candidates, including Bob Boone, Dwight Evans, Keith Hernandez, Fred Lynn, Dave Parker and Dan Quisenberry, would have become eligible in 2013.\nAs it turned out, this would be the last election for the Veterans Committee in this particular form. In July 2010, the Hall announced a new voting procedure to consider individuals not eligible for the BBWAA ballot. Starting with the elections for 2011 induction, the Veterans Committee was split into three 16-member subcommittees, each made up of Hall of Famers, executives, baseball historians, and media members. Each subcommittee votes once every three years on candidates from a composite ballot including both long-retired players and non-playing personnel. The ballots and subcommittees were divided by era, with the first vote involving figures from what the Hall calls the \"Expansion Era\" (1973 and later). The following year saw candidates considered from the \"Golden Era\" (1947–1972), with candidates from the \"Pre-Integration Era\" (1871–1946) following in the 2013 election. The first player elected under the new procedure was Ron Santo, elected in 2011 by the Golden Era subcommittee as part of the class of .\nPre-1943.\nFor the first and ultimately only time, a separate election was held for players whose major league careers began before 1943; these elections are scheduled to occur every five years. The election was conducted on December 7, 2008 at the winter meetings in Las Vegas, among a committee of twelve Hall members and members of the media, with results announced the following day; votes by proxy would be allowed only in emergencies, but this was not necessary. The Historical Overview Committee of the BBWAA selected 10 candidates to appear on the ballot, with votes from 75% of the committee necessary for election; each committee member could vote for up to four candidates, allowing for a maximum of five selections. The final ballot was announced on August 25; the candidate who received at least 75% of the vote and was elected is indicated in bold italics.\nThe committee members apparently made an effort to vote for as many candidates as they were allowed, casting at least 41 of a possible 48 individual votes (vote totals for three candidates were not released), for a minimum possible average of 3.42 votes per ballot.\nOf the ten final candidates, none were living; Vernon was alive at the time the final ballot was announced, but died a month later. The finalists included candidates spanning the entire period from 1868 (White) to 1960 (Vernon), although six of the ten were active in the 1940s; four of the top five finishers were active in the 1940s, with the four pre-1930 candidates gaining no more than 12 total votes.\nThe voting committee comprised:\nThe Historical Overview Committee was permitted to nominate candidates who played in the Negro leagues prior to 1946, as long as their time in the Negro leagues and major leagues totals at least ten seasons; this rule would seem to include players such as Minnie Miñoso (who debuted with the New York Cubans in 1945) and Don Newcombe (who debuted with the Newark Eagles in 1944), even if they did not appear in the Negro leagues until after 1943. Negro league first baseman Buck O'Neil, whose playing career began in 1937, was eligible to be included on this ballot; however, if the overview committee believed that his contributions to baseball after his playing career ended outweigh his playing accomplishments, he could be instead considered in the election for non-players in 2010. The rules state that: \"Those whose careers entailed involvement as both players and managers/executives/umpires will be considered for their overall contribution to the game of Baseball; however, the specific category in which such individuals shall be considered will be determined by the role in which they were most prominent. In those instances when a candidate is prominent as both a player and as a manager, executive or umpire, the BBWAA Screening Committee shall determine that individual's candidacy as either a player (Players Ballot), or as a manager, umpires, executive or pioneer (Managers/Umpires Ballot, or Executives/Pioneers Ballot).\"\nBecause of the 2010 changes to Veterans Committee voting, this would be the only vote of the pre-1943 committee.\nJ. G. Taylor Spink Award.\nThe J. G. Taylor Spink Award has been presented by the BBWAA at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1962. It recognizes a sportswriter \"for meritorious contributions to baseball writing\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame writers\" or words to that effect.\nThree final candidates, selected by a three-member BBWAA committee, were named on July 15, 2008 in New York City in conjunction with All-Star Game activities: Nick Peters of \"The Sacramento Bee\", Dave Van Dyck of the \"Chicago Tribune\", and Bob Elliott of the \"Toronto Sun\". All 10-year members of the BBWAA were eligible to cast ballots in voting conducted by mail in November.\nOn December 10 at baseball's winter meetings, Nick Peters was announced as the recipient. Peters, who covered the San Francisco Giants from 1961 to 2007, received 210 votes out of the 447 ballots cast, with Elliott receiving 123 votes and Van Dyck receiving 107; seven blank ballots were submitted.\nFord C. Frick Award.\nThe Ford C. Frick Award has been presented at the annual summer induction ceremonies since 1978. It recognizes a broadcaster for \"major contributions to baseball\". The recipients are not members of the Hall of the Fame, merely featured in a permanent exhibit at the National Baseball Museum, but writers and broadcasters commonly call them \"Hall of Fame broadcaster\" or words to that effect.\nTo be eligible, an active or retired broadcaster must have a minimum of 10 years of continuous major league broadcast service with a ball club, a network, or a combination of the two.\nTen finalists were announced on October 6, 2008. In accordance with guidelines established in 2003, seven were chosen by a 20-member committee composed of the 15 living recipients, along with 5 additional broadcasting historians and columnists: Bob Costas (NBC), Barry Horn (\"The Dallas Morning News\"), Stan Isaacs (formerly of New York \"Newsday\"), Ted Patterson (historian) and Curt Smith (historian). The seven finalists chosen by the committee were: Billy Berroa, Ken Coleman, Dizzy Dean, Lanny Frattare, Tony Kubek, Graham McNamee and Dave Van Horne. Three additional candidates – Tom Cheek, Jacques Doucet and Joe Nuxhall – were selected from a list of 210 candidates through results of voting by fans conducted throughout September at the Hall's official website, with 145,138 ballots cast.\nOn December 9 at baseball's winter meetings, it was announced that Tony Kubek would be the recipient. Kubek, who was a television analyst for NBC, the Toronto Blue Jays and the New York Yankees from 1965 until his 1994 retirement, became the first recipient of the Frick Award whose broadcasting career was solely in television (1995 recipient Bob Woolf is best known as a television play-by-play man, but has also worked in radio), and also the first recipient to have called games for a Canadian team. He was selected in a November vote by the same committee which selected the finalists. They voted by mail, and based the selection on the following criteria: longevity; continuity with a club; honors, including national assignments such as the World Series and All-Star Games; and popularity with fans."

Rookie of the Year was Alex Zanardi. The competition soon starting catching up to Vasser, who had to fend off two late challenges from veterans: Al Unser Jr.'s consistent performance saw him come close to tying Vasser late in the season, but his hopes evaporated after a last-lap crash at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course and an engine failure while leading on the final turn at Road America. Michael Andretti's resulting victory there and in Vancouver put him in contention at the final race, but a disappointing result at Laguna Seca gave Vasser the championship.

        "text": "Andrés Yungo Torres Feliciano Jr., (born January 26, 1978) is an American former professional baseball center fielder. He stands tall and weighs and is a switch-hitter. Torres played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Texas Rangers, New York Mets and San Francisco Giants.\nBorn in New Jersey, Torres grew up in Puerto Rico before returning to the United States to attend Miami-Dade Community College. He was a track star at Miami-Dade and did not begin playing baseball until later. In 1998, he was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. Torres played in their minor leagues until 2002, when he made his major league debut. In 2003, he got a chance to be the everyday center fielder for the Tigers, but after 23 games they chose to replace him. He played only three games for them in 2004 before he was outrighted to the minors and released upon request. In 2005, Torres resurfaced with the Texas Rangers but only appeared in eight games. He spent the next three years in the minor leagues.\nTorres returned to the majors in 2009, as a reserve outfielder for the San Francisco Giants. In 2010, he became their everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter, winning the Willie Mac Award and helping the team win its first World Series since 1954. After the 2011 season (in which Torres battled injuries and lost playing time in September), he was traded to the New York Mets. He spent one season with the Mets, starting in center field for the most part except for a stretch in which he platooned with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, before re-signing with the Giants in 2013. He was used in a platoon split with Gregor Blanco in 2013 before suffering a season-ending Achilles injury in August. After going unsigned to begin 2014, Torres signed a minor league deal with the Boston Red Sox in June, but opted out of his contract in late July after not getting called up.\nEarly life.\nTorres was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and moved to Aguada, Puerto Rico, with his family when he was one year old. He played very little baseball as a child in Puerto Rico, and did not become serious about becoming a professional baseball player until he was 18. He attended Dr. Carlos Gonzalez High School and Miami-Dade Community College. At Miami-Dade, he was a track and field star, running the 100 meters in 10.37 seconds. In 1997, the Florida Marlins drafted him in the 23rd round of the Major League Baseball Draft, but he chose not to sign. He was then drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, and that time he signed.\nCareer.\nDetroit Tigers (2002–2004).\nTorres failed to bat higher than .236 his first two years in the minors, but he did steal several bases. However, in 2000, while playing for the Single-A advanced Lakeland Tigers of the Florida State League, Torres posted what was arguably the best minor league season in his career. With Lakeland, he batted .296 while leading the league with 65 stolen bases. During that season, he was promoted to the Double-A Jacksonville Suns of the Southern League for a short period of time; however, he struggled with Jacksonville, batting just .148. Detroit switched their Double-A affiliate to the Erie SeaWolves of the Eastern League in 2001; Torres spent the season with them but was limited to 64 games because of shoulder surgery. He batted .294 with 74 hits and 19 stolen bases.\n2002.\nTorres was considered Detroit's \"leadoff hitter of the future\" in 2002, according to Jason Beck of \"MLB.com\". He began the season with the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens of the International League but was soon called up by the Detroit Tigers on April 7. He made his major league debut that same day and notched his first hit, a triple against CC Sabathia in a 5–1 loss to the Cleveland Indians. He batted .211 and was sent back to Toledo on April 26 after he had no hits in 12 at bats during a series against the Kansas City Royals. In 115 games for Toledo, Torres batted .266, tying Nick Punto for the league lead with 42 stolen bases, tying Omar Infante for fourth in the league in triples (eight), and finishing fourth in the league with 80 runs scored. The Tigers initially chose not to call up Torres in September when rosters expanded; he did not rejoin them until September 20 following injuries to Bobby Higginson and Hiram Bocachica. In 19 games (70 at bats) with the Tigers, Torres batted .200 with 14 hits, three runs batted in (RBI), and two stolen bases.\n2003.\nThe next season, Torres failed to make the Tigers out of spring training, but he split the season between Detroit and Toledo. He was called up on April 29 to play centerfield and bat leadoff for the Tigers. After he batted .224 in 23 games, the Tigers traded for Alex Sánchez on May 27 to replace Torres in centerfield and sent Torres to Toledo to make room for Sánchez. He was recalled on June 18 to be a reserve outfielder when Ernie Young was designated for assignment. On this stint, Torres tried to improve his hitting by batting exclusively right-handed, saying, \"I feel better from the right side.\" He batted .208 in 23 games on this stint before being sent back to Toledo on August 2 to make room for A. J. Hinch to return from the disabled list. Torres was recalled one final time, in September. On September 14, Torres hit his first home run, a solo shot off of Jimmy Gobble of the Royals in a 7–2 loss. In 59 games (168 at bats) with the Tigers, he batted .220 with 37 hits, one home run, and five stolen bases. Despite playing only 70 games in Toledo, Torres finished fifth in the International League with 27 stolen bases.\n2004.\nTorres was initially sent to the minors to begin 2004 but was recalled on April 7 without playing a game for Toledo when Dmitri Young broke his leg. He only appeared in three games (and didn't even have a plate appearance) before the Tigers attempted to outright him to the minors. Instead of going to the minors, Torres requested his release. He was granted free agency on April 22.\nChicago White Sox organization (2004).\nJust four days after getting released by the Tigers, Torres signed with the Chicago White Sox. He spent the rest of the 2004 season with the International League Charlotte Knights (outside a six-game rehab stint), batting .295 with 95 hits in 87 games and tying with Jason Tyner for eighth in the league in stolen bases, with 23. After the season, he filed for free agency.\nTexas Rangers (2005).\nOn November 16, 2004, Torres was signed by the Texas Rangers. He started 2005 with the Triple-A Oklahoma RedHawks of the Pacific Coast League, but he only played in 15 games (due to a sprained right shoulder) before getting called up by the Rangers on May 15 when Gary Matthews Jr., went on the disabled list. However, the Rangers designated him for assignment on June 12 and outrighted him to Oklahoma City on June 17 after he batted .158 in eight games with them. Torres suffered a right abdominal strain a week later which ended his season.\nMinnesota Twins organization (2006).\nTorres signed with the Minnesota Twins on December 25, 2005. He spent the entire 2006 season with the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings of the International League, batting .236 with them in 116 games and tying for second in the league with nine triples (tied with Joe Thurston behind Wayne Lindon's 12). He became a free agent after the season.\nDetroit Tigers organization (2007).\nUnsigned through February in 2007, Torres called the Detroit Tigers and asked for a job. The Tigers signed him on March 2 and assigned him assigned to Erie, where he was named the Eastern League Player of the Week for April 30 through May 6 after he batted .550. He batted .292 with 17 stolen bases in 85 games before being promoted to Toledo. His 11 triples led the Eastern League despite the fact that he only appeared in 85 games. At Toledo, Torres also batted .292 in 42 games. He was caught stealing bases (six) more times than he stole successfully (five), but in only 42 games, he managed to tie for second in the league with nine triples (tied again with Thurston behind Brian Bixler's 10). Following the year, he again filed for free agency.\nChicago Cubs organization (2008).\nOn November 20, 2007, Torres signed with the Chicago Cubs. In 2008, he engaged a private hitting instructor named Chris O'Leary to help him out. He began trying to model his swing after Albert Pujols, instead of merely trying to put the ball on the ground and run to first base, which is what he had been doing. He spent the entire season with the Iowa Cubs of the Pacific Coast League, batting .306 in 118 games with 11 home runs. He finished fifth in the league with 91 runs scored, tied for second in the league with 10 triples (tied with Trent Oeltjen and Nate Schierholtz behind Tim Raines Jr.'s 13), and led the league with 29 stolen bases. However, the Cubs did not re-sign him and he once again filed for free agency following the season.\nSan Francisco Giants (2009–2011; first stint).\n2009.\nTorres signed with the San Francisco Giants on January 9, 2009. After a strong spring training, he was named to the Giants' Opening Day roster as a reserve outfielder. Except for a minor league rehab assignment, he spent the entire year in the majors. He was placed on the disabled list on April 27 with a strained left hamstring. After a rehab assignment, he was activated on May 26. On June, 15 he hit the 48th \"Splash Hit\" home run at AT&amp;T Park, against John Lackey in a 9–7 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He was again placed on the disabled list on July 31 with the same injury he suffered earlier in the year; he was out until September 1. On September 20, he hit two home runs against Randy Wolf in a 6–2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He finished the year with a career high .270 batting average and tied for eighth (along with Craig Counsell, Gerardo Parra, Everth Cabrera, and Juan Pierre) in the National League (NL) with eight triples despite only playing 75 games.\n2010:World Series Champion.\nIn 2010, Torres began the season as a backup outfielder again. On April 25, he replaced Eugenio Vélez (who had been filling in for the injured Aaron Rowand) as the Giants' center fielder, playing six games until Rowand's return on May 1. Upon Rowand's return, Torres returned to a reserve role until May 9, when he became a starting outfielder for the rest of the season after Mark DeRosa hurt his wrist. On May 30, he had a game-ending RBI single in the 10th inning against Carlos Rosa to give the Giants a 6–5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. By midseason, he had replaced Rowand as the Giants' everyday center fielder and leadoff hitter. After the Giants blew a 9–2 lead over the Florida Marlins on July 28, Torres had a game-ending single in the 10th inning against Clay Hensley to give the Giants a 10–9 win. After the Giants blew a 7–3 lead on August 12, Torres had a game-ending RBI single against Andrew Cashner in the ninth inning to give the Giants an 8–7 victory over the Chicago Cubs. On the morning of September 12, Torres woke up with severe stomach pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis. He underwent an appendectomy the same day. He returned to the lineup roughly two weeks later, and on October 1 it was announced that he had won the 2010 Willie Mac Award. Torres said upon receiving the award, \"It's the best. It's an honor for me from my teammates. I've been blessed and I'm happy and just thank God for everything, putting me here and these guys treating me like a family.\" In 139 games (507 at bats), Torres hit .268 with 84 runs scored, 136 hits, 16 home runs, and 63 RBI. He ranked fourth in the NL in doubles (43, behind Jayson Werth's 46 and Matt Holliday's and Ryan Braun's 45) and ranked seventh in the NL in triples (eight). He finished the year having led the Giants in stolen bases with 26.\nTorres batted .115 in his first seven playoff games before batting .406 over the last eight. In the first four games of the 2010 World Series against the Texas Rangers, he had extra-base hits, tying a Giants' playoff record for most consecutive games with an extra-base hit. He had a home run off Colby Lewis in Game 3 of the World Series; however, the Giants lost that game 4–2. In Game 4, he doubled twice, driving in a run and scoring another as the Giants won 4–0. Torres also had two stolen bases but was caught twice in the postseason. He won his first World Series ring as the Giants defeated the Rangers in five games to win their first World Series since 1954.\n2011.\nAfter injuring his left Achilles tendon on April 9, Torres spent time on the disabled list from April 15 to May 10. On May 30, Torres hit his first career grand slam against Kyle McClellan in a 7–3 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. Three days later, he scored three runs in a 12–7 victory over St. Louis. On July 15, Torres had three hits, scored three runs, drove in two runs, stole a base, and slammed into the wall while making a nice catch to rob Kyle Phillips of a two-RBI double in a 6–1 victory over the San Diego Padres. He went on the disabled list a second time, from August 13 through August 28, with a bruised right leg. After Torres batted just .228 through the beginning of September, he lost quite a bit of playing time to Cody Ross and Justin Christian for the remainder of the year. In 112 games (348 at bats), Torres hit .221 with 77 hits, 24 doubles, four home runs, and 19 RBI. He led the Giants in stolen bases once again, with 19.\nNew York Mets (2012).\nOn December 7, 2011, the Giants traded Torres and Ramón Ramírez to the New York Mets for Ángel Pagán. The Mets and Torres settled their case of arbitration on January 17, 2012, with Torres earning $2.7 million for the 2012 season.\nOn Opening Day (April 5) 2012, Torres re-injured his left calf—which he had previously hurt during 2012 spring training—and spent much of April on the disabled list. He was activated on April 30. However, though he would receive most of the starts in center field, he began to platoon with Kirk Nieuwenhuis, who had filled in for him when he was on the disabled list. This continued until July 29, when Nieuwenhuis was returned to the minor leagues, enabling Torres to be the full-time starter for the rest of the season. Torres endured a career-worst 0 for 18 streak that he finally snapped with a hit against Rafael Betancourt on August 20 in a 3–1 loss to the Colorado Rockies. In 132 games (374 at bats), he hit .230 with 86 hits, 17 doubles, seven triples, three home runs, 35 RBI, and 13 stolen bases (in 18 attempts). As a right-handed hitter, he batted .286. He joined José Reyes as the only players in Mets' history to have two games in a season with a triple and home run. Following the season, he filed for free agency.\nSan Francisco Giants (2013; second stint).\nOn December 13, 2012, Torres agreed to a one-year non-conditional contract to return to the San Francisco Giants. He began 2013 platooning with Gregor Blanco in left field. On May 8, he had a game-winning RBI single against Antonio Bastardo in the 10th inning of a 4–3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. From May 20 through June 30, he batted .298 with 11 doubles and 14 RBI in 35 games. He had a game-tying RBI double against Rex Brothers on May 25 in an eventual 10-inning, 6–5 win over Colorado. On July 13, he began platooning with Blanco in center field after Jeff Francoeur was called up. His season came to an end on August 1, when he was placed on the disabled list with a left Achilles strain, an injury which he acknowledged prevented him from hitting for power in 2013. In 103 games (272 at bats), Torres hit .250 with 68 hits, two home runs, and 21 RBI while only managing four stolen bases. He fared better from the right side at the plate, batting .291 as opposed to batting .206 left-handed. After the season, Torres filed for free agency.\nBoston Red Sox organization (2014).\nOn June 11, 2014, Torres signed a minor-league deal with the Boston Red Sox. He played five games with the Lowell Spinners of the Single-A (short season) New York–Penn League and 18 games with the Pawtucket Red Sox of the International League. He batted .292 with Pawtucket. On July 28, 2014, Torres opted out of his contract with the Boston Red Sox by exercising an out clause in his contract.\nPersonal life.\nTorres was married to Soannie Mendoza. She died on December 8, 2016, from NUT midline carcinoma related causes. The couple has a son, Diego, born in 2004, and a daughter, Mia, born in 2012.\nIn 2002, Torres was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD); however, he did not begin taking medication to treat it until 2007. His medication has been helpful to him, and he is currently a spokesperson for ADHD. In 2012, Plan A Films produced a feature-length documentary about Torres titled \"Gigante\", discussing his ADHD. The film was directed by Chusy Haney-Jardine. Though a screening for the movie was shown at the NYU Langone Medical Center on May 31, 2012, the movie was never released."

A team comprising representatives predominantly from New South Wales and the Australian Federal Police departed and played a number of games against the London Metropolitan Police, Irish Garda, Welsh and Combined British Police sides, with mixed success.

The players on this Tour represented all states and territories of Australia. Matches were played against the London Metropolitan, Welsh, Scottish, Irish Garda and Combined British Police teams. The A.P.R.U. were highly competitive winning two games and being narrowly defeated in two others.\nFollowing the 2008 National Championships, a representative was chosen to travel to New Zealand for a Tour coinciding with the Bledisloe Cup. The A.P.R.U. were unfortunate to be beaten by better sides in their first 2 encounters, but bounced back to take the third game against Northland Police.\nThe Blue Tongues team undertook a short two-game tour of Fiji in 2011, playing the Fiji Police in Nadi and Suva.\nNational Championships.\nThe A.P.R.U.

        "title": "Battle of Nuremberg (2006 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "The Battle of Nuremberg (, , ; also known as the Massacre of Nuremberg) is the nickname of a football match played in the round of 16 of the 2006 FIFA World Cup between Portugal and the Netherlands at the Frankenstadion in Nuremberg on 25 June 2006. Russian referee Valentin Ivanov issued a FIFA World Cup record four red cards and 16 yellow cards, setting a new record for cards shown at any FIFA-administered international tournament.\nBackground.\nPortugal and the Netherlands had met at the semi-final stage of the previous major tournament, UEFA Euro 2004 held in Portugal, which had finished 2–1 to the host nation, but had not featured the same level of animosity between the players. A total of five Dutch and eleven Portuguese players who took some part in that fixture were also on the field in Nuremberg.\nThe match.\nFirst half.\nMark van Bommel was booked in the second minute, and also before the goal Dutch defender Khalid Boulahrouz was booked for a foul, which injured Cristiano Ronaldo and would eventually force the substitution of Portugal's star winger before half time. Ronaldo left in tears, and proceeded to describe Boulahrouz's tackle as \"clearly an intentional foul to get me injured.\" In the meantime, Maniche had been booked for a foul on Van Bommel after 19 minutes.\nShortly after Maniche’s 23rd minute goal, Portugal's defensive midfielder Costinha slid into Dutch veteran Philip Cocu, receiving a yellow card. He was then the first to be sent off just before half time after being shown a second yellow card for a handball.\nSecond half.\nAfter Petit had been cautioned in the 50th minute, Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Luís Figo both received yellow cards, with Figo's coming as a result of a touchline melee with Mark Van Bommel during which Figo headbutted him. Portugal manager Luiz Felipe Scolari controversially gave his approval to this headbutt by stating after the match, \"Jesus Christ may be able to turn the other cheek but Luís Figo isn't Jesus Christ.\"\nBoulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute with a second caution after fouling Figo, which sparked a melee on the touch-line, involving Boulahrouz (who confronted Simão), André Ooijer and the Portuguese bench, necessitating the intervention of the fourth official Marco Rodríguez. Portugal's playmaker Deco roughly fouled Dutch defender John Heitinga and was booked; the Netherlands had not given the ball back after Portugal had cleared it into touch to allow a player to receive medical treatment, thus breaking one of football's gentlemen's agreements. In the ensuing brawl, Wesley Sneijder pushed Petit to the ground and was also cautioned. The Netherlands' Rafael van der Vaart received a yellow card, apparently for dissent.\nAfter that, Portugal's goalkeeper Ricardo (presumably for time wasting) and left-back Nuno Valente (for a rough foul) were punished. Deco received his second caution and was dismissed in the 78th minute for delaying the restart after a free-kick was awarded. Cocu escaped a caution for wrestling Deco to the ground in his attempt to retrieve the ball. In the 88th minute, Simão drew the ire of the Dutch goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar, after the Portuguese player's leg made contact with Dutchman's in his attempt to score a goal, but the referee decided against taking any disciplinary action. In injury time, Van Bronckhorst was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Tiago.\nA scene was shown on television footage during the match in which Boulahrouz, Deco, and Van Bronckhorst were sitting together on the sidelines after being sent off, the latter two having a discussion, both being teammates at Spanish club Barcelona. Commentator Gary Bloom referred to the scene as the \"Bad boys' corner\".\nAftermath.\nIn the aftermath of the match, referee Ivanov was criticised by FIFA president Sepp Blatter, who suggested that Ivanov should have given himself a yellow card for his poor performance during the match. Blatter later regretted these words and promised to apologise officially. FIFA announced that Ivanov would referee no further matches in the tournament. Ivanov's father Valentin Ivanov defended his son, saying it had been FIFA's demand for referees to be tough on the players.\nWhen Portugal faced England in the subsequent quarter-final, they were without the suspended Deco and Costinha. Portugal managed to reach the semi-finals. However, they had two players suspended for that match due to accumulated yellow cards, including the ones against the Netherlands.\nThe record for yellow cards in a World Cup game was surpassed in 2022, when Antonio Mateu Lahoz issued a total of 18 yellows (17 for players/managers plus another for a member of coaching staff) during the quarter-final match between the Netherlands and Argentina."

He had a batting average of .393 going into mid-May, when he badly injured his right hamstring. This landed him on the disabled list, and ended his promising start to the season. After the injury, the Sun-Times interviewed him. \"The only thing I can think of is not playing every day,\" Hall said. \"It's frustrating any time you get hurt, but especially when you wait so long (to make it to the majors).\" On June 30, 1994, Hall suffered another setback in his rehab and was put on the emergency 60 day disabled list.

He played as a pitcher in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago White Sox, Montreal Expos, Philadelphia Phillies, and New York Mets.\nAmateur career.\nJones graduated from Centerville Senior High School and later attended Indiana University Bloomington. In 1983, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Cotuit Kettleers of the Cape Cod Baseball League and was named a league all-star. He was drafted by the Pirates in the third round of the 1984 amateur draft.\nProfessional career.\nJones played his first professional season with their Class A (Short Season) Watertown Pirates in , and his last season with the Milwaukee Brewers' Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs in .\nJones started his career with Pittsburgh, pitching in 26 games with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1986. He went 3-4 while finishing ten games with three saves in 37.1 innings for a 2.89 ERA. He fared worse in the following year, pitching in 32 games while going 2-4 with a 5.61 ERA in 43.1 innings. He got more playtime with the 1988 season, as he played 59 games with 25 games to finish with three saves in 82.1 innings. He had a 2.84 ERA while playing for the Pirates before being dealt to the Chicago White Sox for Dave LaPoint on August 13.\nThe next year, he went 3-2 while pitching in 22 games, garnering one save in 74 innings with a 2.37 ERA. Oddly enough, it was the first and only time in his career that Jones had his walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP) below 1.000, as he had a WHIP of 0.989 (having allowed 22 hits and 8 walks in 30.1 innings). Jones would have his peak in 1990. He made appearances in 65 games while pitching a 2.31 ERA with an 11-4 record in 74 innings with a save. On July 1, he was the winning pitcher in a game that saw Andy Hawkins pitch a no-hitter, but still lose the game. Jones came in to pitch the eighth inning with the score tied at zero. He allowed a base runner to reach on an error but then got the next three batters out. He received the win when the White Sox scored the go-ahead run in the 8th on three errors and two walks On December 23, he was traded along with Ivan Calderon to the Montreal Expos Jeff Carter, Tim Raines, and Mario Brito.\nHis time with Montreal proved laborious. He pitched in 77 games (the most of his career and the most in the National League that year), pitching 88.2 innings while having a 4-9 record with a 3.35 ERA and 13 saves. On December 9, he was traded by the Expos to the Philadelphia Phillies for Darrin Fletcher and cash.\nHis troubles did not cease with new scenery. He went 7-6 with two teams, but he had a 5.68 ERA with a WHIP of 1.722 while pitching 69.2 innings with one save. On August 8, he was granted his release by the Phillies, and he signed with the New York Mets six days later.\nAfter the season ended, he signed with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent. He appeared in just six games that year, allowing eight runs (one unearned). His last appearance was on May 22, going an inning while allowing two runs on two hits with two walks and a strikeout. He was granted his release by the Sox on June 4."

        "text": "Twin Elm Rugby Park is a sports venue in South Nepean, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. With five rugby fields and 12 changing rooms, two lounges, a bar and spectator seating for hundreds of people it can accommodate several concurrent matches and serves as the home of several local clubs. The facility is fully air conditioned with kitchen facilities. The Eastern Ontario Selects play their home games at the venue, and also hosts a number of national and international games. In addition to rugby, the park is also home to other sports such as soccer, lacrosse, ultimate Frisbee and volleyball.\nHistory.\nTwin Elm Rugby Park was founded by a dedicated group of rugby enthusiasts on June 25, 1973. The park is jointly owned by the Bytown Blues, Ottawa Beavers &amp; Banshees, Ottawa Ospreys, and the Ottawa Irish Rugby Club. Under the management of a volunteer Board of Directors, Twin Elm has grown over the last half century to hold a special place in Canada’s rugby history. The park has hosted provincial and national championships at the high school, junior and senior levels, as well as numerous international matches, including Canada’s epic 18-16 victory over France in 1994, and the Canadian women’s first ever home soil victory over the U.S.A. in 2001. With the explosive growth of Rugby 7's Twin Elm Rugby Park was fortunate to have been chosen to host the NACRA 7's championship in 2012. The park has also showcased the Canadian German Shepherd championship, Gaelic Athletic competitions, lacrosse, and touch football to list a few.\nIn November 1996 the fabled front pitch became forever remembered as the site of World Rugby Hall of Fame's Al Charron's last club game on Canadian soil as he led his Ottawa Irish Rugby Club to the Ontario Rugby Union's McCormick Cup championship in a dramatic 29-17 victory over the York Yeomen. The victory secured an epic second Triple Crown complementing earlier season championships in the Rugby Ontario Magnificent 7's and the Senior League title.&lt;/ref https://www.rugbyontario.com/content_page/10027398/&gt;\nDozens of internationals have developed their skills on Twin Elms five pitches, and have gone on to wear the maple leaf with pride at Rugby World Cup’s going back 30 years, most recently at the 2021 Women’s Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. Twin Elm also holds the unique distinction of being the only rugby park in the world to have produced the captains of both the women’s and men’s national teams in consecutive Rugby World Cups. This unprecedented accomplishment occurred when Sherri Sparling captained Canada at the 2002 Women’s Rugby World Cup in Spain, and Al Charron followed by leading the Canadian men’s squad into Australia in 2003.In the spring of 2023 Twin Elm continued its proud tradition of excellence in helping to develop elite players as the Ontario Senior women played two games against their Quebec counterparts, and the Rugby Canada Youth Commonwealth Games 7’s held trial matches. \nTwin Elm Rugby Park's status as the premier rugby facilities in Eastern Canada was solidified in July 2023 when the Austalian Wallaroos Senior women's national rugby team made Twin Elm Rugby Park their training venue of choice while visiting Ottawa, Canada for two weeks as part of the women's rugby 2023 Pacific Four Series.\nDuring this same period Twin Elm Rugby Park hosted women's international matches with a July 4 battle that saw USA U20 take on Wales. Wales was featured in a second international the following week as they took on Canada U20 on July 13 in a live broadcast that was streamed around the globe. A U18 Canada East training camp began the search for the next generation of great Canadian athletes."

It consisted of 20 stages covering a total of , and was won by Tony Rominger of the Clas-Cajastur cycling team.\nRace preview and favorites.\nAmong the starters in Jerez de la Frontera were such big names as Erik Breukink, Robert Millar, Steven Rooks and Stephen Roche. However, none of them seemed to arrive in good form, and none of them lived up to their reputation. Among the locals, the defending champion Melchor Mauri, Pedro Delgado and Laudelino Cubino were the favorites.\nRace overview.\nThe first decisive stage was the first individual time trial, won by Dutch rider Erik Breukink. The big surprise that day was pure climber Jesús Montoya who managed second on the stage and took the leader's jersey. Rominger, suffering from a concussion and a knee injury due to an earlier crash, lost almost three minutes.\nTwo days later, during the queen stage in the Pyrenees, with 5 major mountain passes ending with the ascensions of the Tourmalet and Luz Ardiden, the names of the contenders became clear, as Mauri lost over forty minutes and Rominger dropped the other contenders on the final climb, to finish second to the stage winner Lale Cubino who had spent the day in a breakaway. Cubino, who until then seemed like a candidate for the overall win, lost time on the ascension of Lagos de Covadonga, where Delgado took the stage and rose to second overall. Montoya limited his losses to Delgado, and Rominger finished right with him after being initially dropped.\nAs Montoya and Delgado closely marked each other's attacks, they were unable to increase their advantage on Rominger who took the lead with a commanding performance in the final flat time trial. After this, Montoya and Delgado joined forces over the final mountain stage, but were unable to unseat Rominger who once again won the stage.\nThus, Rominger became the first Swiss rider to win the Vuelta. He was joined on the final podium by Jesús Montoya and Pedro Delgado.\nDoping.\nÓscar Vargas initially won stage 20, but tested positive for caffeine in the subsequent doping test. He was stripped of his result and given a three-month suspension."

Completed in 1968, it is the first permanent, artificially refrigerated bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track in the world. In July 2021, the track was severely damaged by the floods that affected the European continent, and is currently under reconstruction.\nHistory.\nIn 1967, Königssee hosted the European luge championships on a naturally refrigerated track. Later that year, it was decided to construct a permanent, reinforced concrete structure that was artificially refrigerated. The track, initially for luge, was completed in 1968. The first international competition took place the following year with the FIL World Luge Championships.\nOn 3–4 December 1977, the track hosted the first Luge World Cup event won by Paul Hildgartner (Italy - men's singles), Andrea Fendt (West Germany - women's singles), and Italy's Peter Gschnitzer and Karl Brunner (men's doubles). \nBobsleigh was added to the track in the 1970s in time for the track to host their sports' championship event in 1979, the first time any track would host both bobsleigh and luge in the same year in a non-Winter Olympic year (the track in Igls, Austria, was the first to do this at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck).\nSkeleton competitions began in the late 1970s, hosting the world championships in 1990. The track was part of Salzburg, Austria's unsuccessful bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics in 2007. In October 2008, it was announced that the track would undergo a renovation project from 2010 to 2016. Costing € 21.7 million to do, the track is being done in part of Munich's bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Renovation includes extending the finish line and a new building near turn 16 and is scheduled to be complete by 2012. The starting area of the track will be started in 2014 and will finish in 2016. On 28 February 2009, it was announced the track would host the 2011 FIBT World Championships after the original winner, Cortina d'Ampezzo, withdrew to issues with the city and the track. The 29th and last Luge World Cup at the track prior to renovation took place on 2–3 January 2010. Bobsleigh and Skeleton had their last World Cup prior to renovation the following weekend.\nTrack renovation was done during the rest of 2010. At the end of March 2010, the Turbodrom Kreisel turn caught fire following some welding work and was badly damaged. Renovation of the refrigeration plant was carried out in December 2010 with ammonia being pumped in on the 18th. Olympic champion Felix Loch made the first run on the luge part of the track on the 23rd in time for the World Cup event on 5–6 January 2011. The renovation was also done for the 2011 FIBT World Championships that took place in late February.\nIn 2021, the track was severely damaged by the flooding across Europe. According to BSD (German Bobsleigh and Luge Association) President Thomas Schwab, it would take until October 2022 before the track will return to competition status. There was no ammonia refrigeration leak though to the piping being shut off to the end of the season.\nOn April 22, 2024, work began on the reconstruction of the bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track with the dismantling of the men's luge start as well as the damaged track segments down to curve 5. The construction phase of the bedload dosing barrier, ammonia and long-distance lines will start in October 2024 and repair work on the Bobstart building in early 2025.\nStatistics.\nThe track has a vertical drop of from the bobsleigh start; the elevation at the base is above sea level.\nTurns 1, 4, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 15 have no names listed in the track diagram."

It consisted of 21 stages covering a total of , and was won by Melcior Mauri of the ONCE cycling team.\nRace preview and favorites.\nMiguel Induráin, Laudelino Cubino and Anselmo Fuerte were the Spanish favourites for the race. Defending champion Marco Giovannetti was also a favourite together with Steven Rooks, Raúl Alcalá and the Colombians Fabio Parra and Luis ‘Lucho’ Herrera.\nIn the end Melcior Mauri was the revelation of the race and beat the future winner of the Tour de France Miguel Induráin in all the time trials. Indurain was forced to ride an aggressive race in the mountain stages but Mauri was able to defend his lead.\nRace overview.\nThe opening stage consisted, on this occasion, of a three-man team time trial. The winning trio consisted of ONCE's Melcior Mauri, Anselmo Fuerte and Herminio Díaz-Zabala. Coupled with ONCE's win in the following day's Team Time Trial, meant the leader's jersey alternated between these three riders for the first week of the race. The team time trial would turn out to have a large impact as Induráin lost almost two minutes to Mauri on this stage.\nStage 8, a individual time trial, was the first decisive stage of the Vuelta. Riders such as Laudelino Cubino and Anselmo Fuerte lost most of their chances that day. Mauri increased his lead by winning the stage, a little less than a minute ahead of Induráin.\nThe Pyrenean stages were awaited with anticipation, to see if ONCE's Catalunyan rider would be capable of withstanding the high mountains. However, the queen stage ending at Pla de Beret had to be suspended due to adverse weather. Russian rider Ivan Ivanov won the 12th stage to the mountaintop ski resort at Cerler, but Mauri held on, losing less than a minute to Induráin.\nStage 14 was a mountain time trial finishing at the ski station in Valdezcaray, where Parra and Herrera set the leading times. Mauri once again put in a good performance, gaining more time on Induráin and leading the general classification ahead of his teammate Lejarreta, Echave and Induráin.\nThe third and final week of the race featured two high mountain stages in the Cordillera Cantábrica mountain range: the historic ascensions to the Alto del Naranco and the Covadonga Lakes. Herrera and Cubino took the stages, but Mauri managed to hang on. Mauri lost some time, but not enough to lose his overall lead. At this point he was the leader and there was still one time trial to go.\nMauri didn't disappoint, winning the Valladolid time trial ahead of Induráin by over a minute to seal his Vuelta win. He would never again perform at such a high standard. Induráin finished second overall, and Lejarreta third."

        "text": "José Fernando González Quinones (born June 19, 1950) is a retired Major League Baseball infielder. After the end of his major league career, he spent one season with the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association. He batted and threw right-handed.\nCareer.\nGonzález originally signed with the short-lived Seattle Pilots as an amateur free agent in , and remained part of the franchise through its move to Milwaukee. He played his first professional season (in American baseball) with their Class A Clinton Pilots in . He was released by the Milwaukee Brewers at the start of the season, and sat it out before catching on with the Pittsburgh Pirates for . He batted .321 with nineteen home runs over two seasons in their farm system, and led the Eastern League in doubles (43) and total bases (256) in to earn a call up to the majors that September. He had two pinch hit at-bats, and struck out both times. Though they weren't teammates very long, González was part of several search parties that went looking for Roberto Clemente's body after Clemente's plane crashed on New Year's Eve, 1972, as he'd grown up idolizing Clemente.\nHe split the season between the Pirates and triple A Charleston Charlies, batting .224 with five runs batted in at the major league level and hitting his first major league home run on May 27 off the Houston Astros' Dave Roberts. After the season, he and pitcher Nelson Briles were traded to the Kansas City Royals for Kurt Bevacqua, Ed Kirkpatrick and minor leaguer Winston Cole.\nHe appeared in just nine games for the Royals when he was optioned to triple A Omaha on May 3 to make room for George Brett on the major league roster. Two days later, his contract was sold to the New York Yankees. In his only season in New York City, González batted .215 backing up Sandy Alomar Sr. at second base. He failed to make the club out of Spring training the following year, and was released. He caught on with the Petroleros Poza Rica of the Mexican League before signing a minor league deal with the Pirates on July 17, .\nGonzález led the International League with 31 doubles in , and batted .310 in a little over a season as a minor leaguer before returning to the Pirates in . He spent the entire season in the majors, batting a career high .276 with four home runs and 27 RBIs. He got most of his playing time at third base, but he also played some outfield and second as well. As a pinch hitter, he was 10-for-27 with nine RBIs.\nGonzález started off slowly in , and was placed on waivers by the Pirates with a .190 batting average at the start of June. He was selected by the San Diego Padres June 5, and took over as the club's starting second baseman.\nHis fortunes turned around pretty immediately with his new club. González had a two home run game against the Chicago Cubs on July 14 (his only two of the season and the fifth &amp; sixth of his career), and completely tore up his old club when the Pirates came to San Diego for a three-game set later in the month (four-for-ten with four RBIs to help his team sweep the series). He batted .250 for the Padres in 1978. Coupled with Ozzie Smith at shortstop, he also provided his club with one of the steadier defenses up the middle in the National League (.982 fielding percentage).\nHis final season in the majors was arguably his best. Though he batted just .217 in , he more than doubled his career home run total with nine, and had a career high 34 RBIs. Regardless, the Padres acquired former All-Star second baseman Dave Cash from the Montreal Expos during the off-season, and released González. He signed a minor league deal with the California Angels in , but never returned to the majors. During the season, he returned to Mexico, and competed in the Mexican league until , when he returned to the Yankees organization as a member of the Southern League's Nashville Sounds as a player/coach. He joined the St. Lucie Legends of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in .\nExternal links.\n, or Sports Illustrated"

The other Spanish favourites included 1986 winner Álvaro Pino as well as Anselmo Fuerte and 1982 winner Marino Lejarreta. Of the potential foreign winners were the strong Colombians which included Fabio Parra and Lucho Herrera.\nPello Ruiz Cabestany won the opening time trial and took the first leader's jersey. The following day a breakaway got away and Viktor Klimov took the jersey. On the sixth stage a break won the day and took an advantage of over four minutes. Gorospe took the leader's jersey. However, on the eleventh stage, Gorospe had a bad day and lost the jersey to Marco Giovannetti who had been second on the general classification and had been in the break that gained the time on the favourites. Delgado tried to close the gap to Giovannetti over the remainder of the race but could not. Giovannetti won his first and only grand tour ahead of Delgado and Anselmo Fuerte."

The first few days of the race saw the leaders jersey change shoulders from Gino de Bakker, Benny van Brabant and Roland LeClercq. The Colombian Omar Hernández took the lead on the sixth stage. On the 12th stage to Cerler, Delgado battled with four Colombians and won the stage. He won the stage 15 time trial, where Colombian Martin Farfan took the leader's jersey. On the following stage to Santander, Delgado took the jersey. However Delgado's team had a bad day several stages later, when Indurain fell and broke his wrist; Delgado had difficulty keeping the jersey from Fabio Parra. Parra was only two seconds behind Delgado on the general classification at one stage. The final time trial was the last chance for Parra to try to take the jersey from Delgado, but Delgado won and increased his lead to win his third grand tour."

In 1990, Stone achieved one of the highlights of his career. After entering the game as a pinch runner earlier in the night, Stone lined a walk off single against the Blue Jays to give the Red Sox sole possession of 1st place, one game ahead of 2nd place Toronto.

Prince Albert Victor, Queen Victoria's grandson, attended the match. The ground was used for Yorkshire Second XI matches until the late 1950s but in 1966 the hospital authorities which owned the site announced that it would be redeveloped.

It consisted of 21 stages covering a total of , and was won by Laurent Jalabert of the ONCE cycling team. Jalabert won the three classification competitions – the general classification, the points classification and the mountains classification being only the third rider (after Eddy Merckx in the 1968 Giro d'Italia and the 1969 Tour de France, and Tony Rominger in the 1993 Vuelta a España) to win all three major classifications in a Grand Tour.\nThe 1995 Vuelta was the first edition that was not held in April and May, as had previously been the case, but instead in September as the last of the three Grand Tours of the year. This was done to attract more high-profile riders, who before had preferred to ride the Giro d'Italia or the Tour de France, which both took place very closely to the Vuelta's timeslot.\nBackground.\nThe Mapei squad arrived in disarray, after one of their lead riders, Fernando Escartín, announced that he would move to Kelme the following year. He was therefore left out of the team, which was led by Abraham Olano. The starting field also included Laurent Jalabert, Alex Zülle, former winner Melcior Mauri (all ), Marco Pantani () and a then unknown Jan Ullrich () in his first ever Grand Tour appearance.\nRace overview.\nThe race started with a prologue time trial in Zaragoza, won by Olano, two seconds ahead of Jalabert. The latter would move into the leader's golden jersey after stage 3, based on a stage win at Alto del Naranco. Olano moved closer in the general classification after the stage-7 time trial in Salamanca, but only gained 23 seconds on Jalabert due to a fall and a puncture along the route. On stage 8 to Ávila, Jalabert attacked almost from the beginning. Olano, left isolated, lost 4:40 minutes and all hopes of winning the Vuelta. Over the course of the two time trials, Olano gained 2:42 minutes on Jalabert, enough to make up for his losses on all stages but the one to Ávila. From this point on, Jalabert only attacked the field close to the finish line, collecting few advantages and some bonus seconds. His lead was so comfortable that he was able to abort an attack on the way to Sierra Nevada and gift the stage win to escapee Bert Dietz ()."

        "text": "The 1994 Vuelta a España was the 49th Edition of the Vuelta a España, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The Vuelta started on April 25 with a short prologue around the Spanish city of Valladolid. The race came to a close on May 15 with a flat stage that stretched from Palazuelos de Eresma to the Spanish capital of Madrid. Seventeen teams entered the race, which was won by Tony Rominger of the team. Second and third respectively were the Spanish riders Mikel Zarrabeitia and Pedro Delgado.\nTony Rominger became the first rider to win the Vuelta a España three consecutive times. Amongst the race's other classifications, Laurent Jalabert of the team won the points classification, rider Luc Leblanc won the mountains classification, Mauro Radaelli of the Brescialat team won the intermediate sprints classification, and Amore &amp; Vita rider Alessio Di Basco won the special sprints classification. finished as the winners of the team classification, which ranked each of the twenty teams contesting the race by lowest cumulative time.\nRace preview and favorites.\nTony Rominger, winner of the past two editions, was once again the favorite. Alex Zülle the previous year's runner up and Pedro Delgado, twice winner of the Vuelta, were expected to be his main rivals.\nTeams.\nA total of 17 teams were invited to participate in the 1994 Vuelta a España. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, so the Vuelta began with a peloton of 170 cyclists. Out of the 170 riders that started this edition of the Vuelta a España, a total of 121 riders made it to the finish in Madrid.\nThe 17 teams that took part in the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1994 Vuelta a España began with a brief individual time trial that circuited the city of Valladolid. The official race route contained three individual time trial events with distances that ranged from to in length. There were a total of eight stages that held many high mountains, while there was only one hilly stage that contained climbs of lesser degree. The nine remaining stages were primarily flat.\nOf the stages that contained mountains, six contained summit finishes: stage 6 to Sierra Nevada, stage 10 to Andorra-Arcalís, stage 11 to Cerler, stage 14 to Sierra de la Demanda, stage 16 to Lakes of Covadonga, and stage 17 to Monte Naranco.\nRace overview.\nRominger showed from the very start that he was unlikely to be easily beaten, as he won the prologue by a large margin.\nOn the sixth stage, ending at the top of the 2700m climb of the Sierra Nevada, Rominger took advantage of an attack by youngster Mikel Zarrabeitia to leave all other riders behind and win the stage. After only one mountain stage Rominger was now the leader by over two minutes over his rivals.\nIn the second week, Rominger put his overall win beyond doubt, gaining another two minutes on his rivals at the Benidorm individual time trial and taking two more stage wins, albeit without much time gain, on the mountaintop finishes at Cerler and the Alto de la Cruz de la Demanda.\nEven though the overall winner was set in stone, there was a spirited fight for second and third places between ONCE leader Zülle and Banesto riders Delgado and Zarrabeitia. This fight was mostly decided when Zülle cracked on the Lagos de Covadonga climb and lost several minutes. This very stage marked the beginning of Laurent Jalabert's transformation from sprinter into GC contender as he took the stage win.\nIn Segovia, on the outskirts of Madrid, Marino Alonso took the only stage win by a Spanish rider in this edition of the Vuelta. It was also in Segovia that the penultima stage was held, a 53 km individual time trial. Zülle set the fastest intermediate times and looked set to win the stage and finish on the podium, but bad luck struck, and after four consecutive mechanical issues he lost any chance of doing so. Rominger took his 6th stage win.\nThe final stage, ending in Madrid, resulted in Jalabert's seventh stage win, a record that also netted him the points classification.\nAlso a record was Rominger's third Vuelta win. He also held the leader's jersey from start to finish (which only three riders had achieved before) and won six stages. The Banesto duo of Zarrabeitia and Delgado accompanied him on the podium.\nIt was the last time that the race was held in late spring as from 1995 onwards the race was held in September."

It consisted of 21 stages covering a total of , and was won by Tony Rominger of the cycling team.\nRace preview and favorites.\nTony Rominger, winner of the previous edition, started the race as the big favourite for the overall win. Among the other contenders were his rivals of the previous year, Jesús Montoya (supported by his Amaya Seguros team that included such names as Melcior Mauri, Laudelino Cubino and Oliverio Rincón), and Pedro Delgado. The ONCE team with Erik Breukink as team leader and riders of the calibre of Laurent Jalabert and Johan Bruyneel were also a strong candidates. Other candidates included Italian Marco Giovannetti and Scotsman Robert Millar, although they weren't supported by strong teams.\nRace overview.\nA Swiss youngster, Alex Zülle, Breukink's ONCE teammate, who had been the revelation of the previous year's Tour de France, surprised by winning the prologue with a commanding lead of over half a minute over the rest of the contenders. He would keep the leader's jersey for the first week.\nIt was expected that the Swiss youngster, who had so far not shown climbing abilities, would lose the lead on the stage 5 mountain time trial to the Puerto de Navacerrada. Zülle not only kept his lead, he won the stage. Only Rominger seemed to be close to the rhythm of his young compatriot, as most of the favorites including Pedro Delgado lost over two minutes that day.\nThe high mountain stages started with the 11th, ending at Cerler. Rominger launched his first attack on the yellow jersey, winning the stage and taking almost a minute out of Zülle. He was now only 18 seconds down on the general classification. The rest of the favorites saw their chances slip away as they were now many minutes down. Only Cubino kept in touch, albeit at a deficit of two minutes.\nAfter a close fought time trial in Zaragoza won by Mauri, the general classification was now solely a two-man fight. Two days later Rominger managed to distance Zülle on the climb to Valdezcaray and took the lead. Throughout most of the mountain stages on the Cordillera Cantabrica mountain range Rominger and Zülle closely marked each other, finishing together; However, on the final of those stages, Rominger hatched a plan to attack on a wet descent, taking advantage of Zülle's weak descending skills. Rominger managed to distance Zülle, which led to the inexperienced Zülle panicking, running wide at a corner and crashing, losing further time. By the end of the stage, Rominger had taken a famous solo win atop the Alto del Naranco and had taken another minute out of Zülle and his chasing ONCE team. This time gain would loom large by the end of the Vuelta.\nThe Vuelta's final stage was a 44 km individual time trial where Zülle was determined to take back Rominger's general classification lead of little over a minute. Rominger voiced his concern that a stomach illness he had contracted the day after the Naranco stage may cost him the overall win. In the end, Zülle took a dominant stage win but was unable to take back all the time he needed. Rominger thus took his second Vuelta with Zülle second and Cubino third.\nRominger dominated all three classifications and became only the second rider after Eddy Merckx in the 1968 Giro d'Italia and the 1969 Tour de France to achieve this in a Grand Tour."

        "text": "The Salón de la Fama del Beisbol Mexicano (in English, Mexican baseball hall of fame), commonly called the Salón de la Fama (Hall of Fame) is a baseball hall of fame and museum located in Monterrey, Nuevo León. It is dedicated to recognizing people who have contributed greatly to baseball in México. It had its first five inductees in 1939. As of 2023, 216 individuals, called \"inmortales\", have been inducted into the Hall.\nElection procedure.\nEligibility requirements.\nTo be eligible for election into the Salón de la Fama, one must be a former player, director, sportswriter, or umpire who participated in Mexican professional baseball, or a player of Mexican nationality who participated in Organized Baseball. However, there have been exceptions to these requirements made.\nPlayers.\nPlayers must have played a minimum of ten seasons in either the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol or Liga Mexicana del Pacífico, or a total of fifteen seasons between the two leagues. In the case of players of Mexican nationality, the seasons played requirement may be satisfied by playing fifteen years in Organised Baseball.\nThe player must have stopped being an active player for at least five years or must have died. The electorate is to consider the merits of the player's performances and records, not for a single feat. After five elections without being elected, the player is removed from the ballot and becomes eligible for election only by the Committee on Veterans.\nThese requirements have not always been in place, as players such as Monte Irvin Roy Campanella and Youman Wilder did not meet the 15-year requirement. Wilder did make the All-Decade Teams of the 1980s and 1990s.\nVeterans.\nVeterans are players who played before 1970 as well as candidates that participated in five voting cycles in the player's election but were not elected. After five veterans' elections without being elected, the player becomes ineligible.\nDirectors.\nClub executives, usually a president or vice-president, must have participated in at least ten years in Mexican professional baseball.\nSportswriters.\nA sportswriter must have covered Mexican professional baseball for at least fifteen years at a national level.\nUmpires.\nAn umpire must have participated in a minimum of twenty seasons total in both leagues.\nNomination.\nPlayers.\nThe nomination and election of former players is carried out annually. The preliminary ballot is created by the Salón de la Fama's administration and it is sent out to the members of the \"Comité Elector\" (Electing Committee) who vote for those whom they consider to have the merits sufficient enter the Salón de la Fama. After the Salón de la Fama receives the votes, the results are soon revealed, and any player who obtains a majority of votes will be considered a candidate for election and be placed on the year's election ballot. The election ballot, is sent back out to the \"Comité Elector\" - but only those with a \"Cédula de Votación\" (Voting Certificate). They will choose the two \"exbeisbolistas inmortales\" who will be enshrined in that year. From 2001 to 2006, three players were elected annually and previous to that four were.\nIn 2011 an exception was made for 5 time all-star and 2x MVP and 2x League champion Youman Wilder, Wilder played 5 years, and did not meet the 10 year minimum requirements even with a 340 career batting average. Wilder has been left off the 2012 ballot, but did make the All-Decade teams of the 1980s and 1990s.\nVeterans.\nThe election of veterans is carried out every other year - the next election was held in 2007. The election ballot, created by the Salón de la Fama's administration is sent to the \"Comité Elector\" and the \"Comité de Veteranos\" (Veterans Committee) for voting. The \"Comité de Veteranos\" is composed of the president and former presidents of the \"Comité Elector\" (Electing Committee), and from 2003 on, living \"inmortales\". The electorate selects the single veteran inductee into the Salón de la Fama.\nDirectors.\nThe election of directors is carried out every three years - the next election was held in 2008. The election ballot, created by the Salón de la Fama's administration is sent to the \"Comité Elector\", the \"Comité de Veteranos\", the league presidents of the LMB and LMP, and the club presidents in the two league's as well. The electorate selects the single inductee into the Salón de la Fama. In 2002, two directors were inducted.\nSportswriters.\nThe election of sportswriters is carried out every three years - the next election was held in 2009. The election ballot, created by the Salón de la Fama's administration is sent to the \"Comité Elector\" and the \"Comité de Veteranos\". The electorate selects the single inductee into the Salón de la Fama.\nUmpires.\nThe election of sportswriters is carried out every three years - the next election was held in 2007. The election ballot, created by the Salón de la Fama's administration is sent to the \"Comité Elector\" and the \"Comité de Veteranos\". The electorate selects the single inductee into the Salón de la Fama.\nElection.\nOnce the ballots for each election are returned (by mid-February), the Salón de la Fama tallies the votes at the \"Convención Nacional de Beisbol\" during the third or fourth week of February. The Salón de la Fama then announces the new \"inmortales\" and they are inducted in June or July. The candidate with the plurality of votes - or in the case of the player's ballot, the two candidates - is inducted."
