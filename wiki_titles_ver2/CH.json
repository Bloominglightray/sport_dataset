        "text": "James Riley Turner (August 6, 1903 – November 29, 1998) was an American pitcher and coach in Major League Baseball. As a member of the Cincinnati Reds and New York Yankees, he was a member of nine World Series Championship teams between 1940 and 1959, two as a player and seven as a coach. Most notably, he was pitching coach for the Yankees under Casey Stengel from 1949 to 1959, during which time they won seven titles. Apart from his baseball career, Turner was a lifelong resident of Nashville, Tennessee.\nCareer.\nFrom 1937 through 1945, he played for the Boston Bees (1937–39), Cincinnati Reds (1940–42) and New York Yankees (1942–45). Turner's Major League career got off to a late start, as he did not reach the big leagues until he was 33 years old, after 14 seasons of minor league ball. He led the National League in earned run average and won 20 games in 1937 as a rookie with Boston. He surrendered a league-high 21 home runs in 1938. Because he worked for his family's dairy farm in the offseason in Antioch, Tennessee, he was known as \"Milkman Jim\" to his fans.\nFor his career, Turner compiled a 69–60 record in 231 games, with a 3.22 earned run average and 329 strikeouts. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, the 1940 Reds and the 1943 Yankees, as well as the 1942 Yankees team that won the American League pennant. In two postseason appearances, Turner was 0–1 with a 6.43 ERA and 4 strikeouts in 7 innings pitched.\nTurner was a better than average hitting pitcher, posting a .218 batting average (87-for-399) with 32 runs, one home run and 22 RBI.\nAfter his pitching career ended, Turner served the Yankees (1949–59; 1966–73) and Reds (1961–65) as their pitching coach, working for ten pennant-winning clubs over that 24-year span. He also managed the Beaumont Exporters (1946), Portland Beavers (1947–48) and Nashville Volunteers (1960).\nTurner was criticized by Jim Bouton in his book, \"Ball Four\". Bouton claimed Turner (his pitching coach with the Yankees from 1966 to 1968) was a front-runner, who only wanted to be associated with successful pitchers."

The new additions were brought in after three teams withdrew from the League before the start of the season. Brighton Bears and London Towers both decided to \"park\" their respective franchises and take a one-year break whilst Birmingham Bullets also decided to sit out due to a lack of suitable home venues available and have since gone into liquidation.\nBBL Cup.\nThis season's edition of the BBL Cup saw the two lowest seeds from the previous season's League rankings face off with the BBL's two newest additions – London United and Worcester Wolves – in the first round. As expected, the experience of Milton Keynes and Plymouth paid off and both teams advanced to the quarter-finals to join the rest of their league rivals in the last eight. In the clash of the round, eventual winners Guildford Heat saw off the Plymouth Raiders in a tie dominated by the shooting of Chad McKnight, who posted 39 points for the Heat.\nThe Semi-finals saw the league's four strongest teams drawn against each other, but while Guildford easily dispatched the visiting Sheffield Sharks, the Cup holders Newcastle Eagles, were defeated by the Scottish Rocks, where Rocks' Robert Yanders netted a game-high 23 points.\nIn only their second season since establishment, Guildford's success story continued when they scooped their first piece of silverware with an 82–79 victory in the Cup Final against the Rocks. Heat's star guard Brian Dux was named as MVP scoring 21 points on the way to victory.\nBBL Trophy.\nDue to the lack of teams competing in this season's Championship, the BBL Trophy featured all 10 BBL teams plus six invited teams, four from the English Basketball League (Coventry Crusaders, London Leopards, Reading Rockets and Worthing Thunder) and two from the Scottish Basketball League (Edinburgh Kings and Troon Tornadoes). The First round saw all 16 teams divided into four regionalised groups with the top finishing team advancing to the Semi-finals.\nGroup stage.\nNorthern Group 1\nSouthern Group 1\nNorthern Group 2\nSouthern Group 2"

        "title": "2005 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2005 Rose Bowl Game was the 91st edition of the college football bowl game, held on January 1, 2005 at the self-named stadium in Pasadena, California. The Texas Longhorns, second-place finishers in the Big 12 Conference's South Division, defeated the Michigan Wolverines, co-champions of the Big Ten Conference, 38-37. Texas quarterback Vince Young and Michigan linebacker LaMarr Woodley were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game, the first time that the Rose Bowl separately recognized an offensive and defensive player of the game.\nThe contest marked the first time Texas and Michigan faced each other in football, despite the long history of each school's football program, and also marked the first Rose Bowl in which a Big Ten team appeared without an opponent from the Pacific-10 Conference. ABC broadcast the game nationally in 720p format, the first time the Rose Bowl was telecast in HDTV in the United States.\nThe game would mark the first of 2 consecutive Rose Bowl appearances for the Longhorns, as they would also play in the 2006 iteration, which they would win over the USC Trojans.\nTeams.\nThe USC Trojans and the Oklahoma Sooners were invited to play in the BCS Championship game in the 2005 Orange Bowl. This gave the Rose Bowl an at-large pick, as it gave up its traditional Pacific-10 Conference champion representative. The 2005 Fiesta Bowl also got an at-large pick, having given up Oklahoma to the Orange Bowl. Because the BCS non-AQ Utah Utes team had finished ranked in the top eight, either the Fiesta Bowl or Rose Bowl had to select them. That left one other slot open for the highest BCS ranked team. The Rose Bowl had first choice of this team over Utah, having given up the higher-ranked team.\nThere was a BCS controversy in the remaining at-large team that was selected to play in the BCS bowl games. The California Golden Bears expected to get the invitation, having only lost one game to the top-ranked and undefeated Trojans. Meanwhile, the Texas Longhorns had lost only one game as well - to the #2 and undefeated Oklahoma Sooners. In the 2004 NCAA Division I-A football rankings on November 27, Cal was in the #4 BCS position and Texas was #5. Texas remained idle the next Saturday, but Cal had defeated the Southern Mississippi Golden Eagles in a makeup game from Hurricane Ivan on December 4. Going into the game, the Golden Bears were made aware that while margin of victory did not affect computer rankings, it did affect human polls and just eight voters changing their vote could affect the final standings. In a dramatic twist, Texas, who had been left out of the BCS the year before because of the Oklahoma loss in the Big 12 championship, got enough voters to change their mind in the final vote and more computer points to slide into the BCS #4 slot. When the December 4 rankings came out, Texas was in the #4 BCS position and Cal was in the #5 position. Texas edged California out of the #4 spot by a mere .0102 points. The final poll positions had been unchanged with Cal at #4 AP, #4 coaches, and #6 computers polls and Texas at #6 AP, #5 coaches, and #4 computer polls.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nA 28-20 loss at Notre Dame took the Wolverines out of contention for the BCS championship. They went through the Big Ten schedule, playing close games except for a 42-20 blowout of the Northwestern Wildcats. In the Michigan-Ohio State rivalry game, the Buckeyes defeated the Wolverines 37-21. Iowa and Michigan shared the Big Ten Conference title with identical 7-1 records. A 30-17 Michigan win over Iowa on September 25 ultimately decided the conference's Rose Bowl participant. Michigan was awarded the traditional Big Ten Rose Bowl selection by virtue of the victory in head-to-head competition over Iowa.\nTexas Longhorns.\nTexas lost only one game, to the 2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team. In the Big 12 South division, this meant that Oklahoma would face Colorado in the Big 12 Championship Game. Oklahoma was invited to the National Championship game. Because the Longhorns were not conference champions, their next bowl game would be arbitrarily picked, and the outcome heavily depended on the play of other teams. Texas would eventually gain an automatic bid to a BCS bowl game by virtue of its #4 BCS ranking (the top four BCS teams are guaranteed spots in a BCS bowl game if the first three teams are conference champions). As USC was participating in the Orange Bowl (that year's BCS Championship Game), the Longhorns were chosen to play in \"The Granddaddy of 'em All\" by the Tournament of Roses Rose Bowl Committee as an at-large team.\nGame summary.\nThe scoring was even 14-14 at halftime. The second half began with quarterback Vince Young scoring on the Wolverines with a 60-yard touchdown run. Michigan held a 10-point lead in the third quarter. Both teams traded scores and it looked as though Michigan would take the game with a late go-ahead field goal in the fourth quarter. But enough time remained for Texas to win. Driving 47 yards in ten plays, Texas had one final chance. Dusty Mangum's 37-yard field goal wobbled through the uprights as time expired.\nScoring summary.\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAftermath.\nTexas coach Mack Brown was criticized for publicly politicking voters to put Texas ahead of California. Cal coach Jeff Tedford called for coaches' votes to be made public. California's cause was hurt when it was less than impressive in a 26-16 victory over Southern Miss in Hattiesburg, Mississippi the night before bowl bids were extended. This game was rescheduled from September due to Hurricane Ivan. Weakening Cal's cause after the fact was its 45-31 loss to Texas Tech University in the 2004 Holiday Bowl. Cal played without two of the highest performing receivers in the NCAA, however, this loss was attributed in many press reports to the Bears' disappointment over being denied their first Rose Bowl appearance in 45 years.\nThe Associated Press, as a result of two consecutive seasons of BCS controversy, pulled its poll out of the BCS formula. The AP poll was replaced by the Harris poll, and the AP continues to give out its own national-championship trophy.\nMany in the press consider the 2005 Rose Bowl to be one of the most exciting contests the Bowl has ever produced. Ratings were spectacularly high and the game itself was an instant classic. Many players from the game (e.g. Young, Edwards, Breaston, Henne, Woodley, Johnson) would move on to prominent roles in the National Football League.\nThis win set the stage for Texas to return to the Rose Bowl for the BCS Championship in the 2006 Rose Bowl. Vince Young would be the Offensive MVP for a second consecutive year."

        "text": "John Stuart \"Jumbo\" Elliott (born April 1, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle for 14 years in the National Football League (NFL) with the New York Giants from 1988 to 1995 and the New York Jets from 1996 to 2000 and 2002. He appeared in 197 NFL games, including 156 as a starter. He was a key player on the 1990 New York Giants team that won Super Bowl XXV, received All-Madden honors in 1990 and 1991, and was selected to play in the 1993 Pro Bowl. His signature moment came in October 2000 when he caught the game-tying touchdown pass in the game known as the \"Monday Night Miracle\".\nElliott played college football as an offensive tackle for the Michigan Wolverines from 1984 to 1987. He started 45 games for Michigan and was twice selected as a first-team All-American, receiving those honors in 1986 and 1987. He was a consensus All-American in 1987. He was the starting left tackle on the 1985 Wolverines team that compiled a 10–1–1 record, outscored opponents 342–98, and was ranked #2 in the final AP Poll.\nEarly years.\nElliott was born in Lake Ronkonkoma, New York, in 1965. He attended Sachem High School on Long Island. He played football at Sachem High School, was selected to the \"New York Daily News\" all-star team, had his number retired by the school in 1989, and was inducted into the Sachem Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nElliott enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1983 as a six-foot, seven-inch, 280-pound freshman. He played college football as an offensive tackle for head coach Bo Schembechler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1984 to 1987, growing to 306 pounds by his junior year. He was a four-year starter on Michigan's offensive line, starting 10 games at left tackle in 1984, 11 games at left tackle in 1985, 12 games at right tackle in 1986, and 12 games at right tackle in 1987. The 1985 Michigan team compiled a 10–1–1 record, outscored opponents 342–98, and was ranked #2 in the final AP Poll.\nHe became known for his dominant blocking, recording 11.5 pancake blocks in two games early in the 1986 season. He was selected a first-team offensive tackle on both the 1986 and 1987 College Football All-America Teams. In 1987, he was a consensus All-American, receiving first-team honors from the United Press International, Walter Camp Football Foundation, American Football Coaches Association, and Football Writers Association of America.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nElliott was selected by the New York Giants in the second round (36th overall pick) of the 1988 NFL Draft. He spent eight seasons with the Giants from 1988 to 1995. He appeared in 112 game for the Giants, 98 of them as the team's starting left tackle. Elliott missed eight games to injury in the middle of the 1990 season, with the team averaging 149.9 rushing yards with him and 111.8 rushing yards without him. With Elliott back in the lineup, the 1990 Giants went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV. Elliott's work against Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith, enabling the Giants to rush for 172 yards, has been described as \"one of the unnoticed keys to the Giants' 1991 Super Bowl victory.\" He received All-Madden honors in 1990 and 1991. He was also selected to play in the 1993 Pro Bowl, but did not play due to a back injury.\nNew York Jets.\nIn February 1996, Elliott had become a free agent and signed a five-year contract with the New York Jets that was reportedly worth between $15 million and $16 million. He appeared in 85 games for the Jets, 58 of them as the Jets' starting left tackle, from 1996 to 2000 and again in 2002. Elliott helped turn the Jets around, from a 1–15 finish in 1996 to the AFC Championship Game in 1998.\nElliott's \"signature moment\" occurred in a \"Monday Night Football\" game on October 23, 2000. Late in the fourth quarter, the Jets were down by seven points to the Miami Dolphins when Elliott caught his only career pass, thrown by Vinny Testaverde, for a touchdown to tie the game 37–37. This play marked the end of the Jets' comeback from being down by 23 points in the fourth quarter. The Jets won 40–37 in overtime. The game has become known as the \"Monday Night Miracle\".\nElliott was released by the Jets in July 2001, and did not play during the 2001 NFL season. He made a comeback the following year and appeared in 16 games, none as a starter, during the 2002 season.\nIn 14 NFL seasons, Elliott appeared in 197 games, including 156 as a starter at left tackle.\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from football, Elliott returned to Long Island. He was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame in the Football Category with the Class of 1993.\nIn 2004, he entered a development deal to open three Dunkin' Donuts shops. As of 2010, he owned two Dunkin' Donuts shops near his home on Long Island.\nElliott was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2020."

        "title": "Ping (golf)",
        "text": "Ping, Inc. (stylized as PING) is an American sports equipment manufacturing company based in Phoenix, Arizona. It focuses on golf equipment, producing golf clubs and golf bags. The company was founded by Karsten Solheim, following a career as an engineer at the General Electric company. In 1959, he started making putters in his garage in Redwood City, California. In 1967, he resigned from his job at General Electric to develop the PING company.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nSolheim began PING golf as a garage business in 1959. His frustration during the game of golf resulted from his difficulty putting with the equipment of the era. The engineer from General Electric invented a new putter in his garage known as the \"PING 1A\". Instead of attaching the shaft at the heel of the blade, he attached it in the center. He applied scientific principles to golf club design, which had previously been based largely on trial and error, transferring much of the weight of the club head to the perimeter.\nThe name \"PING\" came from the sound that Solheim heard as the metal struck the ball. Popular musician-golfer Murray Arnold shared in 1960 that the clubhead, on striking the ball, rings out with the 440 pitch used in tuning pianos. By the end of 1960, Solheim had 6 designs, intentionally muffled the \"ping\", and had made over 2,000 putters in his garage.\nIn 1961, the Solheims moved from Redwood City, California to Phoenix, Arizona where the company would find a permanent home. Despite the increasing sales of the PING putter, Solheim continued to create his putters single-handedly in his garage after departing General Electric.\nIn the same year, he invented his first set of irons which he named \"69\", which he considered to be a good round of golf. Solheim continued to experiment with the effects of good heel-toe weighting in his irons and also milled a cavity into the steel back of the irons for added forgiveness.\nThe first PGA Tour victory while using a PING club came in 1962 at the Cajun Classic Open Invitational by John Barnum. Sales of the PING putters rose as the popularity steadily increased. The Golf World Cup of 1965 brought even greater sales of the garage-made PING putters as many of the top players used the PING putters during the televised event in Japan.\nLater years.\nIn 1966, Solheim had an idea for a new putter flash in his mind. As he was unable to find a piece of paper, the design for his new putter was sketched on the dust cover of a 78 RPM record. After Solheim had finalized the design, he was still in need for a name. Solheim's wife Louise suggested the name \"Answer\" for the new putter as it \"was an answer for the vexing problems in putting\". As the name \"Answer\" would be too long to fit on the putter, the name was shortened to just \"Anser\". Additionally, without a W, Anser could be trademarked.\nPING faced a major obstacle at the end of 1966 as the USGA, golf's governing body for rules and equipment, outlawed all PING putters other than the Anser for tournament and handicap play. The decision came as the other PING models had a special bend in the shaft located under the grip which was thought to give players a special advantage in the putting stroke.\nAcceptance came when Julius Boros won the PGA Tour's Phoenix Open, using Solheim's \"Anser\" putter in early 1967. Later that year, Solheim resigned from G.E., moved his business from his garage to a factory and establish Karsten Manufacturing Corporation (KMC) makers of the Ping brand of clubs in Phoenix, Arizona. The patent for the PING Anser putter came on March 21, 1967. The first major championship to be won using a PING putter came in 1969 at the Masters. In 1969, Ping introduced irons based on the same principle of perimeter weighting, and these were quickly successful. The other golf equipment manufacturers soon followed Ping's innovations, which became industry standards. The last major innovation by PING during the 1960s came with K1 stainless cast steel iron set.\nLegacy.\nDuring a White House meeting between President Donald Trump and Norwegian Prime minister Erna Solberg on January 10, 2018, Solberg gave Trump a Ping \"Bergen\" Putter as a gift as a symbol of the close ties between the nations, and the history of Norwegian immigration to the United States. Born in Norway, Ping's founder Karsten Solheim was from Austrheim, outside Bergen; as a toddler, he moved with his family to Seattle, Washington.\nFitting innovation.\nPing was the first manufacturer to offer high-quality cast clubs using investment casting which both reduced costs, allowed better quality control for high tech features, and set the stage for manufactured fitting.\nPing was also the first to offer factory fitting, via a variety of clubheads in different lies and offsets. Beginning about 1980, Ping began offering their fitting program based on a checklist of the player's physical characteristics, common problems, and distances.\nThe 2011 checklist at the Ping website contained approximately 100 data inputs and was part of a 5-step fitting process covering everything from driver to putter.\nTo make custom fitting more feasible, Ping manufactures some iron clubheads with a small notch in the clubhead. The notch allows the clubhead to be bent to the required specification without the danger of breaking the clubhead as was the problem for previous models.\nSponsorships.\nPing has maintained endorsement deals with many professional golfers playing on the leading tours, including Tony Finau, Viktor Hovland, Louis Oosthuizen, Sahith Theegala, Bubba Watson and Lee Westwood."

        "text": "Tennis ball cricket (Softball Cricket) is a variant of cricket played using a tennis ball. It is popular in the Indian subcontinent and is also played in Middle-East, United States, Canada, Australia and Europe. A tennis ball is easier to play with compared to a conventional hard cricket ball and is also less likely to cause injury. There is no definite record as to when this originated in the Indian subcontinent.\nHistory.\nTennis ball cricket originated in the Indian subcontinent though there is no definite record as to when it started. The first Tennis Ball Cricket body was formed in 1982 known as Tennis Ball Cricket Association of India (TBCAI). Many prominent international cricketers have played some form of tennis ball cricket early in their careers.\nRules and playing areas.\nThe rules of this game can vary significantly from standard cricket, and often the rules of regular cricket do not apply as they normally would. The number of overs in a game and players in a team is usually less than in a conventional cricket match. Considering that the ball is not as hard as a professional cricket ball, the use of protective gear like gloves, pads and helmets is optional. The playground can be anywhere from a house backyard to a beach to a relatively-uncrowded street, the courtyard of a school, the driveway of a residential building, agricultural fields or any open public spaces with shorter user defined boundaries and make shift stumps. In the Middle East, it is played in the open desert and baseball or soccer grounds are used in the US, Canada and Europe.\nThe ball used is a typical tennis ball, a ball that is intended for the sport of tennis. Tennis balls are fluorescent yellow-green in most cases but can be virtually any color in recreational play. Tennis balls are covered in a fibrous felt, which modifies their aerodynamic properties, and each has a white curvilinear oval covering it. The ball may be wrapped with a tape to induce swing in some cases.\nTournaments.\nAs tennis ball cricket matches are shorter and suited to recreational play, conventional tournaments have been hosted in South Asian countries and Middle East. 10PL has been organized at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium since 2020 with the participation of international cricketers like Robin Uthappa and Dwayne Bravo. In 2023, National Tennis Ball Cricket League was established with eight teams in India. In December 2023, The Indian Street Premier League – T10 was announced with Ravi Shastri, former Indian cricket team captain and head coach, as chief mentor. The core committee also consists of Mumbai Cricket Association president Amol Kale and BCCI treasurer Ashish Shelar."

        "title": "Sussex county cricket teams",
        "text": "Sussex county cricket teams have been traced back to the early 18th century but the county's involvement in cricket dates from much earlier times as it is widely believed, jointly with Kent and Surrey, to be the sport's birthplace. The most widely accepted theory about the origin of cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times, as a children's game, in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South Downs and the Weald.\n17th century.\nThe first definite mention of cricket in Sussex relates to ecclesiastical court records in 1611 which state that two parishioners of Sidlesham in West Sussex failed to attend church on Easter Sunday because they were playing cricket. They were fined 12 pence each and made to do penance. A number of such cases were heard in Sussex during the 17th century and there were two instances of players dying, both in Sussex, after being struck on the head during a match.\nDespite these problems, cricket became established in Sussex during the 17th century and the earliest village matches took place before the English Civil War. It is believed that county teams were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660. Roy Webber, in his \"Phoenix History\", states that \"the period between 1650 and 1700 seems to be that in which the game took a real grip, and it would seem that cricket was centred mainly in the counties of Kent, Sussex and Hampshire\". In 1697, the earliest \"great match\" recorded was for 50 guineas apiece between two elevens at a venue in Sussex.\n18th century.\nRichmond and Gage.\nMatches involving the two leading Sussex patrons Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond, and Sir William Gage were first recorded in 1725. The first teams that were nominally representative of Sussex as a county seem to have been assembled in the 1728 season to play against Edwin Stead's Kent. Three matches are known to have been played and all were won by Kent. A contemporary report says after the third match that it was \"the third time this summer that the Kent men have been too expert for those of Sussex\". In the 1729 season, a team led by Gage is believed to have achieved the sport's earliest known innings victory in a match against Kent. Gage's team was called \"Surrey, Sussex &amp; Hampshire\" in one account, however, and so was not a Sussex team \"per se\". In the context of the time, with cricket mostly confined to the south-eastern counties, the combined team was effectively a Rest of England side assembled to take on Kent, the strongest county.\nSlindon.\nFrom 1741, Richmond patronised the noted Slindon Cricket Club, whose team was probably representative of the county and at one stage was proclaimed to be the best team in England. Slindon's best-known player was Richard Newland, supported by his brothers Adam and John; and by the controversial Edward Aburrow, a good cricketer but a known smuggler.\nHambledon connection.\nDespite some periods of decline, Sussex teams continued to hold first-class status throughout the 18th century. It has been suggested by historians that the Hambledon Club represented Sussex as well as Hampshire for inter-county purposes. Several noted Sussex cricketers, including Richard Nyren and Noah Mann, played for Hambledon.\nBrighton.\nCricket in the county saw a revival during the Regency period that coincided with the rise of Brighton as a fashionable resort. Brighton Cricket Club became prominent and was, for a long time, representative of Sussex as a county. Sussex (i.e., Brighton) had a particularly successful 1792 season when it won all four of its matches, winning against MCC (three times) and Middlesex.\n19th century.\nNapoleonic Wars.\nDespite a crippling loss of manpower and investment, cricket managed to survive the Napoleonic Wars and much of the credit for keeping the game alive goes to the Brighton club as well as to MCC.\nRoundarm revolution.\nBrighton's reward was to see Sussex achieve great prominence in the aftermath of the war and it was the Sussex bowlers William Lillywhite and Jem Broadbridge who led the roundarm revolution of the 1820s.\nFoundation of the county club.\nIn 1836, the first steps were taken towards forming a county club. A meeting in Brighton set up a Sussex Cricket Fund to support county matches. It was from this organisation that Sussex County Cricket Club was formally constituted on 1 March 1839.\n\"For the history of Sussex cricket since the foundation of the county club, see Sussex County Cricket Club\"."

        "text": "Tony Dale Woodcock (born 27 January 1981) is a New Zealand former rugby union player. His position was loosehead prop, and he played 111 tests for the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks. Woodcock played for the All Blacks from 2002 to 2015, scoring eight test tries. He was described by \"The Dominion Post\" as \"widely regarded as the world's premier loosehead\", and by \"The New Zealand Herald\" as having the \"best range of skills of any prop on the planet\". He is now the most capped All Black prop of all time, and is the second most capped player in Blues history, behind Keven Mealamu. He was a key member of the 2011 and 2015 Rugby World Cup winning squads, becoming one of only 20 players to have won multiple Rugby World Cups.\nClub rugby.\nHe played for Blues in Super Rugby, and for North Harbour in the ITM Cup (when available).\nAfter 113 appearances for the , he joined the for the 2013 Super Rugby season.\nHowever about a year later, after spending a year with the Highlanders who came 2nd to last in Super Rugby, Woodcock decided to return to the Blues where he would be closer to his family. He signed a 1-year contract.\nWoodcock has a reputation for playing as much rugby as possible. In 2005 he played in the first eleven of the twelve All Black test matches that year. From 2001 to 2004, he played in every match for North Harbour, except for the first two matches of 2004 due to being on All Black duty, and in 2002 and 2003, he played the full eighty minutes of every game for North Harbour. In 2006, he requested and received permission from the All Black coaching staff to return a week early from his enforced rest due to All Black duty, to play in North Harbour's Ranfurly Shield challenge against Canterbury, a match that North Harbour won 21–17, making them the Ranfurly Shield holders for the first time.\nAll Blacks.\nWoodcock made his international debut for New Zealand on 23 November 2002 when he started against Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Woodcock was one of six debutants that day and started alongside Blues teammates Keven Mealamu and Daniel Braid, the former of whom would go on to become a long-serving front-row partner to Woodcock. Woodcock played the full 80 minutes, something rare for a prop and the All Blacks beat Wales 43–17.\nWoodcock did not play for the All Blacks again until 2004, a year when he started three times. Woodcock became a regular starter for New Zealand in 2005, starting in all three tests against the touring British and Irish Lions team, with the All Blacks failing to lose in all of those tests. Woodcock started in 10 of his 11 international appearances in 2005, and made 10 appearances for the All Blacks in 2006.\nHe was the first All Black prop to score a test try against Australia in 20 years, when he scored the first try of his international career on 30 June 2007 against Australia in a 15–20 loss and another try against Australia the following week, when the All Blacks won 26–12. After his performances through the year, Woodcock was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Woodcock made started in four of his three appearances in the competition, the most notable being when he played the full 80 minutes of New Zealand's shock 18–20 loss to France in the quarter-final of the World Cup, eliminating them for the competition.\nWoodcock was retained in the All Blacks in 2008 and on 2 August 2008, he became the first All Black prop to score two tries in a match (a rare feat for a prop against any side) against Australia in over 50 years. He had a heavy workload for the All Blacks in 2008, playing 12 tests for them that year.\nWoodcock celebrated his 50th test to kick off his 2009 international rugby season, but it was unfortunately spoiled by losing 22–27 on the occasion, against France in Dunedin.\nHe scored New Zealand's only try in the 2011 Rugby World Cup final against France, becoming the first All Black prop to score a try in a Rugby World Cup final, and only the second prop ever to do so.\nHe received his 100th cap for the All Blacks in a test match in Wellington against Australia on 24 August 2013. Woodcock was not subbed off, with replacement prop Wyatt Crockett instead replacing Sam Whitelock in the 27–15 win over Australia.\nWoodcock was named in the 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where he scored a try in a 47–9 victory against Tonga in the final pool match of the competition on 9 October. His 118 test-match career in rugby union unfortunately ended in the same match, when he was injured and replaced by Wyatt Crockett in the 43rd minute. Joe Moody was subsequently flown over to England from New Zealand, in order to replace Woodcock, who remained in the country and collected his winners' medal following New Zealand's 34–17 victory in the final against Australia's Wallabies.\nIn the 2016 New Year Honours, Woodcock was appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to rugby.\nOther activities.\nOutside rugby, Woodcock has a deer farm near Kaukapakapa."

The boxing press accepted the new weight division and Root was accepted as the inaugural world champion. Jack Root was defeated in his first title defense against George Gardner (boxer), who was considered the most thrilling fighter in the division, and the first undisputed Light - Heavyweight Champion of the World.\nDuring the 1980s, however, some boxing historians found records indicating that Joe Choynski won a twenty-round decision over Jimmy Ryan on August 18, 1899, in a fight billed as being for the light heavyweight championship.

The race is limited to 32 entrants.\nThe event was first staged in 1990, and, after a successful first year, the Regatta Stewards decided to make it a permanent fixture. The cup, awarded to the winning crew on finals day, was made in 1835 by Charles Fox, and has been engraved with a sketch of the Temple on Temple Island at the start of the regatta course.\nThere was no foreign winner until 1996, when the United States' Yale University won the final. Since 2000, foreign crews have dominated the event winning 14 times in 18 years with 10 of the winners hailing from the United States.

He previously served as the head coach at Columbia University and has worked as an assistant coach at Hofstra University, Villanova University, and Boston College.\nEarly life and playing career.\nJones was born in Ronkonkoma, New York in 1965 and graduated from Half Hollow Hills West High School in Dix Hills, New York in 1983. He was a four-year letter-winner at SUNY Oswego, where he earned a bachelor's degree in communications in 1987 and a master's degree in counseling in 1989. He played point guard for the Lakers and currently ranks 4th in assists and 5th in steals in the school's history.\nCoaching career.\nJones began his coaching career serving as a guidance counselor and coach of the middle school boys basketball team at Comsewogue on Long Island. He would eventually take over as the head coach of the high school team for two years from 1993 to 1994. He joined Jay Wright's staff at Hofstra University in 1994 and moved on to Villanova University three years later as an assistant to Steve Lappas. When Wright replaced Lappas at Villanova in 2001, Jones remained on the staff as the assistant responsible for recruiting, game scouting and on-court teaching.\nColumbia University.\nJones succeeded Armond Hill as the head coach at Columbia University after the 2002–03 season, when Columbia finished 0–14 in the Ivy League, 2–25 overall. In his first season, the Lions finished 6–8 in the league, 10–17 overall – the third-best single-season improvement in conference history. In 2006–07, Jones led the Lions to a 7–7 Ivy League finish, their first .500 record since 1999–2000. Their 16–12 overall record was the team's best since 1992–93. Jones left Columbia with an 86–108 win–loss record over seven seasons.\nBoston University.\nAfter leaving Columbia, Jones would serve as the associate head coach at Boston College for one season before accepting the head coaching job at Boston University.\nPrior to his second season as head coach at BU, it was announced that BU would be leaving the America East Conference to join the Patriot League on July 1, 2013. As a result of the move, the America East presidents unanimously voted to ban BU from postseason play in all America East sports for the 2012–2013 season. Despite their inability to win the conference championship and earn an automatic bid to the NCAA tournament, Jones took the Terriers to his first-ever postseason as head coach when they played Loyola University Maryland in the first round of the CIT.\nIn 2020, his 16th year as a head coach, Jones won his first conference tournament title when Boston University defeated Colgate in the championship game of the Patriot League tournament. The victory earned him what would have been his first NCAA tournament appearance as a head coach, but the 2020 tournament was subsequently cancelled in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Jones was named a finalist for the 2019–20 Ben Jobe Award.\nPersonal life.\nJones' brother James is the head men's basketball coach at Yale University.\nJones provided commentary for the online halftime show during the 2008 and 2009 NCAA tournaments."

        "title": "Battle of the Sexes (tennis)",
        "text": "In tennis, \"Battle of the Sexes\" describes various exhibition matches played between a man and a woman, or a doubles match between two men and two women in one case. The term is most famously used for an internationally televised match in 1973 held at the Houston Astrodome between 55-year-old Bobby Riggs and 29-year-old Billie Jean King, which King won in three sets. The match was viewed by an estimated fifty million people in the United States and ninety million worldwide. King's win is considered a milestone in public acceptance of women's tennis.\nTwo other matches commonly referred to as a \"battle of the sexes\" include one held four months earlier in 1973 between Riggs and Margaret Court over the best of three sets, and one in 1992 between Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova over the best of three sets, with hybrid rules favoring the female player dubbed \"The Battle of Champions\". These matches were won by Riggs and Connors, respectively.\nAt least eight other exhibition matches have been played between notable male and female tennis players starting in 1888, though only some of them were referred to at the time as a \"battle of the sexes\".\n1973: Riggs vs. Court.\nRiggs had been one of the world's top tennis players in the 1940s; he was ranked year-end number one three times and had won six major titles during his career, including three Wimbledon titles. After he retired from professional tennis in 1951, Riggs remained a master promoter of himself and of tennis. In 1973, he opined that the female game was inferior and that even at his current age of 55 he could still beat any of the top female players.\nRiggs first challenged Billie Jean King, but when she declined, Margaret Court stepped in, accepting the guarantee of $20,000 for the match, more than she had earned for winning both the 1973 Australian and French Open women's singles titles. At the time, Court was 30 years old and had recently returned to tennis after giving birth to her first child in March 1972. She was in the midst of earning her seventh year-end ranking as number one female player in the world. On the day of their match on May 13, 5,000 fans came to the Mother's Day match in Ramona, California. Televised by CBS Sports, Riggs descended the stadium steps and presented Court with Mother's Day flowers, which she accepted while curtsying. Riggs used his drop shots and lobs to keep Court off balance. His quick victory (6–2, 6–1) landed Riggs on the cover of both \"Sports Illustrated\" and \"Time\".\n1973: Riggs vs. King.\nSuddenly in the national limelight following his win over Court, Riggs taunted all female tennis players, prompting King to accept a lucrative financial offer to play Riggs in a nationally televised match in prime time on ABC that the promoters dubbed the \"Battle of the Sexes\". The match, which had a winner-takes-all prize of $100,000 ($ today), was held in Texas at the Houston Astrodome on Thursday, September 20, 1973.\nThen 29-year-old King had earned her fifth year-end ranking as World No. 1 female player the previous year, and would finish second to Court in 1973.\nKing entered the court in the style of Cleopatra, on a feather-adorned litter carried by four bare-chested muscle men dressed in the style of ancient slaves. Riggs followed in a rickshaw drawn by a bevy of models. Riggs presented King with a giant Sugar Daddy lollipop, and she responded by giving him a squealing piglet, symbolic of male chauvinism. Riggs was given $50,000 ($ today) to wear a yellow Sugar Daddy jacket during the match, which he took off after three games. Riggs also placed many bets on and invested a lot of money in the match.\nKing, who also competed in the Virginia Slims of Houston tournament during the same week, won in straight sets, 6–4, 6–3, 6–3. In the first set, she fell behind 3–2 when Riggs broke her serve. In a 2015 interview, she said that most people do not remember that she was initially behind in the first set, and it looked bad for her in the early going. At this point, King realized that she \"had to win\" given the importance of the match, and broke right back in again in the tenth game to close out the set. She had learned from Court's loss and was ready for Riggs's game. Rather than playing her own usual aggressive game, King mostly stayed at the baseline, at least at first, easily handling Riggs's lobs and soft shots, making him cover the entire court as she ran him from side to side and beat him at his own defensive style of play. After quickly failing from the baseline, where he had intended to play, Riggs dropped his comedic affect and showed a more serious demeanor, as he was forced to change to a serve-and-volley game, but he was no match for King.\nSome male critics were less impressed by King's victory, pointing to the fact that she was 26 years younger. Jack Kramer, who was against equal pay for women and offered a tournament in which the female winner got $1,500 while the male winner got $12,000, was one example. According to him, \"I don't think Billie Jean played all that well. She hit a lot of short balls which Bobby could have taken advantage of had he been in shape. I would never take anything away from Billie Jean—because she was smart enough to prepare herself properly—but it might have been different if Riggs hadn't kept running around. It was more than one woman who took care of Bobby Riggs in Houston.\" But before the match, King had forced the American television network ABC to drop Kramer as a commentator. King said, \"He doesn't believe in women's tennis. Why should he be part of this match? He doesn't believe in half of the match. I'm not playing. Either he goes—or I go.\"\nMore neutral observers were impressed by King's brilliant play and smart tactics: \"She both first-served aggressively and attacked Riggs' own softball deliveries with authority. She rushed to the net and commanded the territory by whipping stunning volleys off her backhand and by taking Riggs' infamous moon-shot lobs out of the Dome lights and rifling overheads right back past him. She varied pace on ground strokes, kept Riggs moving from corner to corner and played consistently to his weak backhand. She concentrated on hitting behind her opponent, wrong-footing him time and time again, then surprising him with some of his own beloved spin garbage. Everything worked...it was a brilliant rising to an occasion; a clutch performance under the most trying of circumstances. Seldom has there been a more classic example of a skilled athlete performing at peak efficiency in the most important moment of her life.\" Feminist media critic Susan Douglas later wrote \"women like me screamed with delight in our living rooms, she not only vindicated female athletes and feminism but also inspired many of us to get in shape—not because it would make us beautiful but because it would make us strong and healthy\".\nThe match had an audience of an estimated 50 million in the U.S. and 90 million worldwide. The attendance in the Houston Astrodome was 30,472; as of 2012, it remains the largest audience to see a tennis match in the United States.\nAllegations of match-throwing.\nThere was some speculation that Riggs had deliberately lost the match. In 2013, National Public Radio aired an interview with Don Van Natta Jr., a senior writer with ESPN. According to Natta, one Hal Shaw was in the pro shop at the Palma Ceia Golf Club in Tampa when two known mobsters entered and proceeded to discuss a proposal from Riggs to win against Margaret Court, but deliberately lose to King, in settlement of a $100,000 gambling debt. The mobsters ultimately decided to accept that proposal. Shaw did not come forward about the matter at the time for fear of retribution by the mob. Per Riggs’ son, Riggs did know quite a few mob leaders, and men related to the mob met with Riggs several times in the weeks leading up to the match with King. However, when these allegations were put to King, she was adamant that she knew what tanking a match looked and felt like, and Riggs did not tank the match.\nOthers speculated that Riggs deliberately lost based on his poor play and large number of unforced errors, in order to win large sums of money that he had bet against himself as a way to pay off his gambling debts. But Riggs had a potential $1 million match against Chrissie Evert in the works if he won, plus it was a winner-take-all match for the $100,000 prize. A headline at the time was \"Women Ecstatic, Men Make Excuses.\" Riggs said afterwards that he underestimated Billie Jean King, who hit outright winners on 68% of her shots.\nThe effects of age.\nMartina Navratilova in 2023 stated that the reason the 55-year-old Riggs lost to the 29-year-old King was simply because of age. Navratilova said Riggs lost “(b)ecause Bobby was too old,” and added, “A 35 year old Bobby would have beaten all of us.”\nEffects on women's tennis.\nKing viewed the match as more than a publicity stunt, feeling that beating Riggs was important both for women's tennis and for the women's liberation movement as a whole. She said later, \"I thought it would set us back 50 years if I didn't win that match. It would ruin the women's tour and affect all women's self-esteem.\" She believed that she had a destiny to work for sexual equality in sports.\nKing was part of the Original 9 players who formed the Virginia Slims Series, created because the women wanted to end inequality of pay between male and female victors. These nine women created their own tournaments and played wherever they could. Eventually this turned into the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA).\nIn popular culture.\nA few months after their match, King and Riggs were guest stars in \"The Pig Who Came to Dinner\" episode of \"The Odd Couple\", which originally aired on November 16, 1973.\nIn 2001, ABC aired a television film about the match between King and Riggs titled \"When Billie Beat Bobby\", starring Holly Hunter and Ron Silver as King and Riggs, respectively.\nIn 2013, New Black Films released the documentary movie \"Battle of the Sexes\" in cinemas, with television broadcast following soon after. It was directed by James Erskine and Zara Hayes. The film was released on DVD in 2014.\nThe 2017 film \"Battle of the Sexes\", directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, is about the King/Riggs match, and stars Emma Stone and Steve Carell as King and Riggs, respectively.\n1992: Navratilova vs. Connors.\nNineteen years later, a third \"Battle of the Sexes\" match, entitled \"Battle of Champions\", was played in 1992. Outdoors at Caesars Palace in Paradise, Nevada, it matched 40-year-old Jimmy Connors and Martina Navratilova, age 35. Navratilova had previously turned down invitations to take on John McEnroe and Ilie Năstase, as she considered them undignified. The promoters initially tried to match Connors with the then top-ranked female player, Monica Seles. Connors called the match 'war'. Navratilova called it a battle of egos.\nA pay-per-view telecast, the match was played on Friday night, September 25, under hybrid rules to make it more competitive; Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half of the doubles alleys. Each player received a $650,000 guarantee, with a further $500,000 for the winner. Connors won 7–5, 6–2, as Navratilova made eight double faults and 36 unforced errors. Connors, too, was nervous, and there was a rumor that he had placed a bet on himself to win at 4:1. According to Connors' book \"The Outsider\", he placed a million-dollar bet that he would lose no more than eight games.\nOther matches of men against women.\n1888: Ernest Renshaw vs. Lottie Dod.\nIn 1888, the Wimbledon's men's champion, Ernest Renshaw, played a handicap match against the ladies' champion, Lottie Dod, where Dod was starting each game with a 30–0 advantage. The match was played in Exmouth, England, and ended with Renshaw's victory, 2–6, 7–5, 7–5. Under the same rules Dod also played Scottish champion Harry Grove, winning 1–6, 6–0, 6–4, and William Renshaw, whom she defeated in two sets, 6–2, 6–4.\n1922: Bill Tilden vs. Suzanne Lenglen.\nOn May 27, 1921, Bill Tilden and Suzanne Lenglen played a match at Saint Cloud, France. It was only a single set, but Tilden prevailed 6–0. When later asked about the match, Lenglen said, \"Someone won 6–0, but I don't recall who it was.\"\n1928–1933: Helen Wills vs. Bill Johnston, Edward Chandler, Phil Neer, and Elmer Griffin.\nIn early 1928, Helen Wills played a series of matches against men. In losing, she took one set each from Bill Johnston and Edward Chandler, but was victorious over Elmer Griffin and Phil Neer. Bill Johnston was a prior Wimbledon and U.S. Champion and had lost in the finals at the U.S. Championships three years prior to their meeting. Edward Chandler had won the NCAA men's singles title in 1925 and 1926, played Davis Cup, and was ranked as high as No. 5 in the United States. Phil Neer won the NCAA men's singles title in 1921 and in 1932–1933 won the doubles event at the Pacific Coast Championships.\nPhil Neer also played a two-set match against Helen Wills on January 28, 1933, in San Francisco. Neer had been ranked nationally as high as Number 8 and had occasionally played mixed doubles with Wills. Wills had won at Wimbledon the year prior. Though Neer was only 32, Wills won the match 6–3, 6–4.\n1936: Dorothy Round vs. H.W. \"Bunny\" Austin.\nThe 1934 Wimbledon singles champion Dorothy Round played H.W. \"Bunny\" Austin (Wimbledon singles finalist in 1932) on July 31, 1936, at Jesmond Towers, Newcastle, England. The hard-fought match, played under a handicapping system (Round receiving 15 and Austin owing 30) was abandoned as a one-set-all draw, Round winning the first set 7–5 and Austin the second, 8–6.\n1939: Alice Marble vs. Cyril Kemp.\nAlice Marble (USA), one of the best players of her day, came to Dublin in 1939 to compete in the Irish Championships at Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club and during her stay played an exhibition match against leading Irish tennis player Cyril Kemp. Marble won the hard-fought match 9-7, 8-6. A full account of the match can be found in the Irish Times edition of 14 July 1939.\nMarble won 18 major championships in her career – five in singles (including 4 US Championships), six in women’s doubles, and seven in mixed doubles. In the week before her appearance in Dublin, she had become the first woman of the century to win the Triple Crown at Wimbledon — the Mixed Doubles (with Bobby Riggs, USA), the Ladies’ Doubles (with Sarah Palfrey, USA), and the Ladies’ Singles titles. She was ranked world No. 1 in 1939.\nKemp was a tennis player of significant accomplishment, including making 9 Davis Cup appearances for Ireland from 1946 to 1952, and winning the Men's Singles Open Irish championships in 1950.\n1975: ATP Tour.\nIn 1975, Ion Tiriac defeated Abigail Maynard 6–0, 6–0 in their round one match at the then coed men's pro circuit (later renamed ATP Tour) of USTA's Fairfiled County International Tennis Championship.\n1975: Challenge of the Sexes.\nOn October 26, 1975, a \"Challenge of the Sexes\" event was held in Mission Viejo, California, televised on CBS. It involved male and female athletes from various sports, such as Laura Baugh and Jane Blalock vs. Hale Irwin and Doug Sanders in golf, and Jerry West vs. Karen Logan in basketball. The tennis event pitted future Wimbledon champion Virginia Wade vs. Björn Borg, and Ilie Nastase vs. Evonne Goolagong. The games had handicapped rules favoring the women where the men were limited to one serve and the women had the added area of the alleys for shot placement. Borg, Wade, and Goolagong entered the court in standard attire and demeanor, while Nastase entered wearing a dress. With Martina Navratilova also in the packed audience, Borg defeated Wade 6–3, but Goolagong defeated Nastase 7–5.\n1985: Battle of the Sexes: The Challenge! (doubles).\nOn August 23, 1985, at age 67, Riggs returned to the tennis spotlight when he partnered with Vitas Gerulaitis, at the time a top-20 player, to launch another challenge to female players. He challenged Martina Navratilova and Pam Shriver to a doubles match. Navratilova said that she accepted because she believed she and Pam had no weaknesses when playing doubles, and that they were going to 'do a Billie' and win, especially given Riggs's age. The match took place at The Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Riggs's health had deteriorated somewhat from his last outing as he was now deaf in addition to his poor eyesight. Moreover, because Riggs was a finesse player and not a power player, the women expected that he would be easier to defeat than a retired power player. Riggs's return was short lived when the women won 6–3, 6–2, 6–4.\nMike Penner (of the \"Los Angeles Times\") wrote: \"The great misconception about 'The Challenge!' was that it might actually serve as a legitimate proving ground for the sexes.\" The sports writer went on to point out that there were things keeping this match from being seriously viewed as a legitimate challenge. \"First, it was a doubles match, not a one-on-one competition. The strategy is different in doubles, weaknesses can be more easily masked and stamina is not nearly so critical a factor.\" Further, \"Riggs amounted to a 67-year-old ball-and-chain shackled to the ankle of Gerulaitis. Riggs couldn't serve, couldn't return serves, couldn't hit overheads with any amount of force. Older than the combined ages of Navratilova and Shriver, Riggs was painfully out of place in this match. Even John McEnroe, on his finest day, would be an underdog against Navratilova and Shriver if Riggs were his partner.\"\n1998: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters.\nAnother event dubbed a \"Battle of the Sexes\" took place during the 1998 Australian Open between Karsten Braasch and the Williams sisters. Venus and Serena Williams had claimed that they could beat any male player ranked outside the world's top 200, so Braasch, then ranked 203rd, challenged them both. Braasch was described by one journalist as \"a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple of bottles of ice cold lager\". The matches took place on court number 12 in Melbourne Park, after Braasch had finished a round of golf and two shandies. He first took on Serena and after leading 5–0, beat her 6–1. Venus then walked on court and again Braasch was victorious, this time winning 6–2. Braasch said afterwards, \"500 and above, no chance.\" He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game \"fun\" and that the big difference was that men can chase down shots much more easily and put spin on the ball that female players could not handle. The Williams sisters adjusted their claim to beating men outside the top 350.\n2003: Yannick Noah vs. Justine Henin.\nIn December 2003, 43-year-old Yannick Noah and 21-year-old Justine Henin played a friendly match at the Forest National in Brussels. Noah donned a dress for much of the match. He played predominantly trick shots and slices and won 4–6, 6–4, 7–6.\n2013: Novak Djokovic vs. Li Na.\nIn October 2013, Novak Djokovic and Li Na played a light-hearted and largely comical five game mini set in Beijing, China to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the China Open. Djokovic clowned to the amusement of the crowd, visibly holding back in an effort to keep the match competitive and at one point swapped places with a ballboy. Li was given a 30–0 advantage at the start of each game and went on to win the mini set 3–2.\n2017: Johanna Konta vs. Pat Cash.\nIn November 2017, an exhibition match was held between 26-year-old female player Johanna Konta and 52-year-old retired male player Pat Cash, organized by the snack brand Nature Valley to celebrate the release of the film \"Battle of the Sexes\" the following week. It was held at the Westfield London shopping centre in London, England, on indoor carpet. One set was played, and Konta won 6–3.\n2021: Hubert Hurkacz vs. Iga Świątek.\nIn July 2021, a single tiebreak game was played between Polish number ones Hubert Hurkacz and Iga Świątek. This was as part of the opening celebrations for the 2021 WTA Poland Open, held in Gdynia. Świątek won the tiebreak 7-4.\n2023: Mirra Andreeva vs. Yanis Ghazouani Durand.\nOn 15–17 December 2023, an exhibition tournament was held in Bourg-de-Péage in France. The final of the women's draw was initially planned to be between Donna Vekić and the winner of Mirra Andreeva and Varvara Gracheva, but Vekic pulled out due to an injury. Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk initially agreed to replace her, but she later changed her mind because of backlash in her home country against her playing Andreeva, who is Russian. In an unusual turn of events, the tournament directors asked ATP world no. 1145 Yanis Ghazouani Durand to play against 16-year-old WTA world no. 57 Andreeva. Ghazouani had lost to Arthur Rinderknech in a men's match two days before and was initially scheduled to be Andreeva's practice hitting partner before the women's final he ended up playing in. He won the match in straight sets, but Andreeva received the winner's trophy.\nUnrealized proposals.\nIn 2013, Andy Murray responded to a Twitter user who asked whether he would consider challenging Serena Williams, saying, \"I'd be up for it. Why not?\" Williams also reacted positively to the suggestion, remarking \"That would be fun. I doubt I'd win a point, but that would be fun.\"\nIn August 2015, John McEnroe was interviewed on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". At that time, McEnroe was 56 years old but still active on the seniors tennis circuit; Serena Williams was 34 years old and in the chase for a calendar-year Grand Slam. McEnroe mentioned to Kimmel that, about 15 years prior, Donald Trump had suggested that he would like to put together a battle-of-the-sexes match between McEnroe and Williams. McEnroe said he would face Williams but that Trump was not offering a big-enough payout. McEnroe said that he believed he could defeat Williams in a tennis match."

        "title": "Adam Jones (baseball)",
        "text": "Adam LaMarque Jones (born August 1, 1985) is an American former professional baseball outfielder. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Baltimore Orioles and Arizona Diamondbacks and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Orix Buffaloes.\nThe Mariners selected Jones in the first round of the 2003 MLB draft. He came up in the Mariners' minor league system as a shortstop before transitioning to the outfield. He made his MLB debut with the Mariners in 2006 and was traded to the Orioles before the 2008 season. Jones is a five-time MLB All-Star, a four-time Gold Glove Award winner, and a Silver Slugger winner.\nEarly life.\nAdam Jones was born in San Diego, California on August 1, 1985, the son of Andrea, who raised Jones and his older brother alone until he was five. Growing up in San Diego, he was a San Diego Padres fan and was a huge fan of Tony Gwynn. Jones excelled at both football and basketball and did not pick up a baseball bat until he was twelve. In 1997 his stepfather, Kenneth, took him to a Padres game after which he started to gain an interest in the sport. He picked up the sport very quickly and went on to star on his high school team. Jones graduated from Morse High School in 2003 after leading his high school team as both a pitcher and a shortstop. During his senior season he batted .406, hit four home runs and batted in 27 runs. On the mound, Jones posted a record of three wins and three losses, while posting a 2.71 ERA. At Morse, Jones was a teammate of future Baltimore Orioles teammate Quintin Berry. Jones initially committed to play college baseball at San Diego State for head coach Tony Gwynn.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nJones was selected by the Seattle Mariners with the 37th pick in the first round of the 2003 MLB draft as a shortstop/right-handed pitcher. Most experts believed Seattle wanted to use him as a pitcher, but Jones said he would prefer to play every day and was made the shortstop of the Mariners' rookie league affiliate. A few years later when the Mariners acquired Yuniesky Betancourt, they asked Jones if he would move to the outfield and he agreed.\n2006–07.\nJones' MLB career began when he was called up to the Mariners from the Tacoma Rainiers on July 14, 2006. He replaced corner outfielder Shin-Soo Choo, whose attempt to fill in for injured starting center fielder Jeremy Reed was unsuccessful. Jones made his major-league debut that night, going 0-for-3 with a fourth-inning walk in a 5–3 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays at Rogers Centre. After going hitless in his first twelve at bats, he got his first major league hit when he singled off Sidney Ponson in the seventh of an 11-inning 5–4 defeat to the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium four nights later on July 18. Jones hit his first home run in the majors off Adam Eaton in the third inning of an 8–2 loss to the Texas Rangers at Ameriquest Field in Arlington on August 10, 2006.\nOn August 3, 2007, Jones returned to MLB for the first time that season, starting in right field against the Boston Red Sox. He went 2-for-4 and scored two runs in the 7–4 victory.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn February 8, 2008, Jones was traded to the Baltimore Orioles along with left-handed reliever George Sherrill and minor league pitchers Kam Mickolio, Chris Tillman, and Tony Butler for the left-handed starting pitcher Érik Bédard.\n2008.\nOn July 28, 2008, Jones became the second player ever to hit a triple and a grand slam in the same game as a visitor to Yankee Stadium (the first was Pat Seerey in 1945). On September 21, 2008, Jones hit the final triple at Yankee Stadium in the second inning off Andy Pettitte and later scored the first run of the game.\nJones finished his first season with the Orioles batting .270 to go along with nine home runs, 57 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 132 games. He was tied for 11th in the major leagues with seven triples.\n2009.\nAfter a strong start to the season, Jones was selected to represent Baltimore in the 2009 All Star Game on July 5. In the game, he drove in Curtis Granderson on a sacrifice fly for the winning run in the American League's 4–3 victory.\nThe second half wasn't as kind to Jones though and in August, he sprained his left ankle and missed the end of the 2009 season. He finished the season with a .277 batting average, 19 homers, 70 RBI and 10 stolen bases in 119 games. He tied for fifth among major league center fielders with nine outfield assists.\nIn November, he was awarded a Gold Glove for his defensive play.\n2010.\nJones finished his third season in Baltimore with a .284 batting average, 19 homers, 69 RBI and seven stolen bases in 149 games. He led all center fielders and was second in the majors in outfield assists with 12.\nHis home runs included an inside-the-park home run on May 22, 2010, when center fielder Nyjer Morgan, apparently not realizing the ball was still on the playing field, threw his glove down in disgust.\n2011.\nAs of August, Jones was having the best statistical season of his career. On August 6, in a game against the Toronto Blue Jays, he hit his then career high 20th home run of the season.\nIn 2011, Jones led the major leagues in sacrifice flies, with 12, and led all AL outfielders in errors, with 8.\n2012.\nJones started the 2012 season hitting .310 with 14 home runs and 31 runs batted in through the Orioles' first 46 games. His stellar play led to the Orioles signing him to a six-year contract extension worth $85.5 million on May 26. Escalators could raise that total to $91.5 million over the same period. The contract surpassed the previous contracts of Miguel Tejada and Nick Markakis as the largest in Orioles' history and made Jones the second highest paid center fielder in Major League Baseball, behind the Dodgers' Matt Kemp. Jones hit the second walk-off home run of his career on June 9, a two-run home run in the bottom of the 12th inning that resulted in a 6–4 victory for the Orioles over the Philadelphia Phillies.\nOn July 1, Jones was selected to be one of the Orioles representatives in the 2012 All Star Game.\nJones hit the 100th home run of his career on August 28 against the Chicago White Sox. Two days later, he established a new career high by hitting his 26th home run of the season, also against the White Sox. Jones played in all 162 games in 2012, batting .287 with 32 home runs and 82 RBI.\nOn September 30, 2012, Jones was named the Most Valuable Oriole for the second consecutive season. The Orioles made the playoffs as a wild card against the Texas Rangers. In the 2012 American League Wild Card Game, Jones hit a sacrifice fly to score a run in the Orioles' 5–1 win. The Orioles would later lose in five games to the New York Yankees in the 2012 American League Division Series.\n2013.\nPrior to the start of the 2013 season, Jones was selected by the United States national baseball team to participate in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. He appeared in his third All-Star Game, his first as a starter.\nJones finished a strong 2013 season batting .285 with 33 home runs and 108 RBI, both of which were new career highs. He did, however, draw only 25 walks and finished with a .318 on-base percentage, his lowest since 2008. On August 11, 2013, at a game at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, a fan threw a banana towards him in the outfield, Jones reported via Twitter.\nAfter the Orioles failed to make the 2013 playoffs, Jones decided to join MLB Network as an extra analyst for the duration of the postseason.\n2014.\nOn April 13, Jones recorded his 1,000th career hit off Mark Buehrle in a game versus the Toronto Blue Jays. In a game against the Houston Astros at Camden Yards on May 11, 2014, he singled with the bases loaded and drove in his 500th and 501st RBIs. Jones participated in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game. After the season ended, he traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars playing against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series. The Orioles went on to win the 2014 American League Division Series in a three-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers, and later lost in a four-game sweep in the 2014 American League Championship Series to the Kansas City Royals.\n2015.\nIn 2015, Jones was elected to his fifth All-Star Game, his fourth in a row. He was originally voted in as a reserve, however, an injury to Kansas City Royals outfielder Alex Gordon allowed Jones to replace Gordon as a starting outfielder. During the Orioles' final game before the All-Star break, Jones hit two home runs in a game against the Washington Nationals, raising his career total with the Orioles to 180. His second home run moved him into eighth on the Orioles all-time home runs list, and it was his seventh career multi-home run game. On July 30, Jones hit the 182nd home run of his Orioles career, which tied him for seventh on the team's all-time list with Ken Singleton. The very next night, Jones hit a three-run home run, giving him sole possession of seventh place on the all-time Orioles home run list. It was also his one hundredth career home run at OPACY. On August 16, Jones went 3-for-4 and hit two home runs in an 18–2 rout of the Oakland Athletics. It was Jones' eighth career multi-home run game.\nJones played in 137 games in 2015, his lowest total since 2009. He hit a career-low .269 with 27 home runs and 82 RBI. The Orioles finished the season with a record of 81–81.\n2016.\nJones started the 2016 season batting second in the starting lineup. He went 1-for-5 with an RBI in the season opener, in a 3–2 win over the Minnesota Twins. On April 6, Jones injured himself during an at-bat late in the game. He sat out for the next four days, before returning on April 11 as a defensive replacement. He wouldn't start again until April 14. Jones hit .224 in April after collecting 15 hits in 67 at-bats. He only hit one home run while driving in seven runs.\nAfter going 1-for-5 in a victory over the Athletics on May 8, Jones' average dipped to .200. He later tweeted \"Gonna figure it allllll out. Part of the grind. #StayHungry\" that day. Over the next week, Jones collected 13 hits, four home runs, nine RBIs, hit .520, and had two game-winning hits (two-run single &amp; solo homerun). \nOn May 13, Jones hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Detroit Tigers. On June 2, the Orioles hit a season-high seven home runs in a game against the Red Sox, two of which belonged to Jones. The second one (in the eighth inning) was his 200th career home run in an Orioles uniform. In addition, his first homer came from the leadoff spot, giving him a home run in each spot in the lineup. On July 8, Jones passed Brady Anderson for sole possession of sixth place on the Orioles all-time home run list with 210.\nJones finished 2016 slashing .265/.310/.436 with an OPS of .746. He hit 29 home runs while driving in 83 runs. He swung at 44.8% of pitches outside the strike zone (the highest percentage in the majors), and swung at 60.6% of all pitches he saw, tops in the major leagues. Jones would go 1-for-5 with a run scored in the Orioles Wild Card Game loss.\n2017.\nDuring the second game of the season, Jones hit his 223rd career home run as an Oriole, tying him for fifth all-time in franchise history with Rafael Palmeiro. Jones would pass Palmeiro five games later with his second home run of the season and 224th in an Orioles uniform. While at Fenway Park on May 1, Jones witnessed a Red Sox fan throw peanuts at him while running into the dugout at the end of an inning and another fan(s) who used a barrage of racial slurs directed at Jones. The next day, on May 2, Jones received a welcoming ovation while playing the next game at Fenway. On May 3, Jones was ejected for the first time in his career, by the home plate umpire, Sam Holbrook, for arguing balls and strikes. On May 10, Jones recorded his 745th career RBI as an Oriole, surpassing Brady Anderson for sixth most all-time in franchise history. On May 21, Jones hit his 124th career home run at Camden Yards, tying him with Rafael Palmeiro for most home runs in ballpark history. The following night, Jones passed Palmeiro with a three-run homer in the second inning, giving him sole possession of first place on top of Camden Yards' home run leaderboard. Jones was also first all-time in extra-base hits and RBIs at Camden Yards. On August 28, Jones hit the 250th home run of his career.\nOn September 1, Jones was ejected in the first inning of a game against the Blue Jays, after expressing his displeasure with a strike call. It was the second ejection of his career, the first coming earlier in the year.\n2018.\nDuring opening day against the Minnesota Twins on March 29, 2018, Jones hit a walk-off home run as the Orioles won 3–2. On April 5, Jones drove in two runs, moving him past Ken Williams for sixth-most RBIs in franchise history. Then, on April 26, Jones tied Boog Powell for sixth-most extra-base hits in franchise history with 557.\nOn August 10, Jones made his first start as a right fielder in an Orioles uniform after playing 1,555 in center for the O's. This allowed Cedric Mullins to take over the position. He ranked first in franchise history in games started and innings played in center and ranked second in games, putouts, assists and Gold Gloves won. Jones' 259 career home runs as a centerfielder ranked 13th most in MLB history. During the game, he collected a stolen base, the 86th of his Orioles career, moving him into 10th place all-time in Orioles history.\nDespite a drop in his power numbers, Jones put up a solid .281/.313/.419 slash line with 15 home runs (the first time he failed to reach 20 since 2010), 63 RBI, 35 doubles and seven steals in 145 games. He became a free agent at the conclusion of the season.\nJones finished his Orioles career with the following ranks in the franchise's history: 875 runs scored (seventh), 1,781 hits (fifth), 305 doubles (eighth), 263 home runs (fifth), 866 RBI (sixth), 595 extra-base hits (fifth). He added five All-Star game appearances, four Gold Gloves and one Silver Slugger during his 11-year tenure.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn March 11, 2019, Jones signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.\nIn 2019, Jones batted .260/.313/.414 with 16 home runs and 67 RBI in 137 games for Arizona. On defense in 2019, he had the lowest fielding percentage of all major league right fielders (.972).\nOrix Buffaloes.\nOn December 10, 2019, Jones signed with the Orix Buffaloes of Nippon Professional Baseball on a two-year contract worth $8 million.\nOn June 19, 2020, Jones made his NPB debut. During the course of the season, Jones slashed .258/.331/.417 and collected 78 hits, 12 doubles and 12 home runs, drove in 43 runs while scoring 29 and stole one base in 87 games.\nOn November 25, 2021, Jones became known as \"Mr. Thanksgiving\" for his game-winning home run in the top of the ninth inning in Game 5 of the 2021 Japan Series on the American Thanksgiving holiday to help Orix stave off elimination.\nOrix opted not to exercise a team option for 2022.\nRetirement.\nOn September 15, 2023, Jones signed a one-day contract with the Baltimore Orioles to officially retire as a member of the team.\nInternational career.\nJones played for Team USA in the 2013 World Baseball Classic and 2017 World Baseball Classic.\nIn the 2017 WBC opening round of group play, Jones helped the USA advance to the second round by recording a walk-off hit vs. Colombia. In the second round, in a game against the Dominican Republic, Jones made a home-run-saving catch that helped propel Team USA into the semifinals. The team went on to win the 2017 Classic against Puerto Rico. Jones was later quoted as saying, \"To do it with those guys, it was probably the best experience of my life so far, especially with sports,\" and was extremely glad to have had the experience.\nTo go along with his solid defensive showcase, Jones slashed .200/.243/.429 and hit two doubles, two home runs and drove in five runs. In addition, Jones hit a walk off single in the US' first game of the tournament against Colombia. Jones also hit a game-tying solo home run against Venezuela in the eighth inning of the US' Pool F game, sparking a rally that led the team to a 4–2 victory.\nPersonal life.\nOn May 29, 2010, Jones was mistakenly detained at the Canadian border while he was trying to get to Toronto. He believed it was a case of mistaken identity; however, he would not disclose whether he was mistaken for Cincinnati Bengals cornerback Adam \"Pacman\" Jones, who has had numerous brushes with the law.\nJones married Maude \"Audie\" Fugett, the only daughter of Jean Fugett, in late December 2014. They had their first son in March 2014. Jones was the best man at Quintin Berry's wedding and also the godfather to his son, Kameron.\nJones is a season ticket holder for the San Diego Gulls of the American Hockey League and has served as an off-ice official for the team, primarily in the penalty box. Jones remains a Padres fan and followed the team and former teammate Manny Machado during their 2022 playoff run.\nJones has four tattoos. One of his mother and another of his grandmother, who he calls \"the two most important women in my life\", on his left shoulder. Whenever crossing the plate after hitting a home run, he would tap his left shoulder as a tribute.\nWhile playing in Japan, Jones started a podcast called \"Heckle Deez\" with brother-in-law Reginald Fugett. He and Fugett brought on guests from the baseball community in both the U.S. and Japan, including Wladimir Balentien and C.C. Sabathia. The podcast released 36 episodes in 2020 and 2021 and was relaunched by \"The Baltimore Banner\" in 2022 as \"The Adam Jones Podcast\". Jones co-hosts the podcast with Baltimore radio personality Jerry Coleman, with Fugett appearing as a moderator of debates between the two.\nFollowing the end of his playing career, Jones also worked for Major League Baseball's operations department. On September 15, 2023, he signed a ceremonial contract with Baltimore Orioles and formally retired from MLB."

        "text": "The Richmond Golf Club (formerly known as Richmond Country Club) is a private social gathering place and sports facility for golf in the Hilltop District of Richmond, California, United States.\nHistory.\nThe land was originally inhabited by the Ohlone people; Spanish conquistadores colonized the land in the 1840s and developed the Rancho San Pablo.\nThe Richmond Golf Club began formerly known as the Carquinez Golf Club, established in 1924. The club began to struggle during the deep recession. Which was a semi-private club meaning if you weren’t a member a round of golf could be played for 5 cents. \nIts manager and head professional, Ed Sawyer, has been found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Ed poured his own money into the Carquinez CC until he ran out of cash. There were less than 40 members at that time. The course had been redesigned to the present configuration in the early 1930s, but was in poor condition and still lacked the necessary water for proper irrigation.\nThe few existing members reached out to Pat Markovich who was well known on the West Coast as an excellent golfer and a member of the PGA. \nThere was a small Board of Directors, but Pat Markovich ran the Carquinez CC. The club was not an immediate success. The country club was eventually rebranded as the \"Richmond Golf Club\" in the early 1930s.\nThe golf club has views towards the Golden Gate Bridge, Bay Bridge and Mount Tamalpais.\nThe club is a former four-time PGA Tour stop and the first in the United States to invite African Americans to participate in professional tournaments. They joined the likes of Ben Hogan, Byron Nelson and Sam Snead who won the 1945 Richmond Open with a 72-hole winning score of 283. \nIn the early 1950’s Richmond Golf Club hosted the LPGA Tour with the best players of the decade. Babe Didrikson Zaharias won the first Richmond Ladies Open with a score of 224 after three rounds. Patty Berg won the second Women's Open in 1952, shooting 8-under par from the men’s tees and set a women’s course record that stands to this day.\nIn April 1953, Pat Markovich and several other investors from Richmond bought the Maxwell estate located on the Silverado Trail in Napa to form the Silverado Country Club.\nThe ranch was subdivided into 140 parcels and the area around the present-day country club was formed into the Nitro Powder Company which changed hands to the Giant Powder Company (also formerly known as Giant). In 1964 it was again sold to Bethlehem Steel. A portion of the steel site was sold to create an expanded Richmond Country Club in 1974. \nThe club covers thousands of acres in the northern Hilltop neighborhood between Hilltop Mall and Point Pinole and is adjacent to Parchester Village to the west, near its entrance along Atlas road and the Richmond Parkway. It is served by AC Transit's routes 71, 376, and LA/LC. It is on more than and has been around since before 1900. Since 1991 the club has hosted a charity tournament for disadvantaged students of Salesian College Preparatory (formerly Salesian High School).\nIn 2018, Pat Markovich was inducted into the Northern California PGA Hall of Fame section.\nIn late 2023, the golf course was rebranded back as the Richmond Golf Club."

        "title": "North American Women's Baseball League",
        "text": "The North American Women's Baseball League (NAWBL) was an amateur baseball league that played from 2003 to 2009. \nThe NAWBL played games scheduled for seven innings, using NCAA rules, including base-stealing and taking leads off bases. Lineup rules allowed liberal substitutions and unlimited re-entry into games, and all players were guaranteed some playing time in each game. The season ran from June through August. Robin Wallace was the organizer and Executive Director, and Al Melanson was the Commissioner.\nPlayers varied in age from high-school freshman to early forties. Some traveled from as far as Connecticut or central New Hampshire. Several players made boys' or men's teams at school. The league was competitive but friendly; arguments with umpires and with opponents were unheard-of. Selected players organized outside the regulation season and entered tournaments; they competed throughout the United States and in Canada, the Dominican Republic, and Japan.\nQuality of play was variable, as the league existed not just for good players who have no other outlet to play baseball but to train new players. Ground outs were executed crisply and double plays were routine. Base running was excellent and was often drilled during the year. But a team could have an outfielder who didn't know where a fly ball would land and was coached into position. Starting pitching was a specialty rather than a shared duty, and several players became dominant as starters. Control was intermittent and a NAWBL rule adopted in 2008 required a pitcher who issued five walks in an inning to be replaced.\nThe squads, named Outlaws (red/black), Ravens (gold/navy), Saints (green), and Seahawks (turquoise) were chosen at the start of the year for parity. Trades between teams during a season almost never happened. The teams were run by the league; although some attracted their own fans and chart-keepers, they didn't promote themselves separately. The league did a minimum of self-promotion. They played day and evening games, with lights, the scoreboard, and an announcer.\nHistory.\nA predecessor New England Women's Baseball League was a player-run and-funded organization that played at many fields in the metro Boston area. This was the New England Division of a league that also had an Ontario Division and a Florida Division.\nThe later NAWBL, with only the New England Division, resumed under Nick Lopardo, owner of the North Shore Spirit of the independent Can-Am League. The NAWBL operated from 2003 through 2005 within the Spirit organization and played its games on Spirit off-days at Fraser Field in Lynn, Massachusetts. The NAWBL all-stars were known as the Lady Spirit. In 2004, the Lady Spirit won a 4-game series against the Dominican national team; head coach Ken Perrone said the series drew close to 4,000 attendees at one game.\nIn 2006 and 2007, the NAWBL was based at Holman Stadium in Nashua, New Hampshire, with the financial backing of John Stabile, owner of the Nashua Pride, also of the Can-Am League. The all-stars traveled as the Pride Pioneers.\nIn 2008, the NAWBL was funded by player dues and conducted a three-team season independent of any professional club. It moved back to Fraser Field, and played some games at World Series Park in Saugus, Massachusetts. In 2009, only a single game was played; on June 28 at Fraser Field, the Ravens led the Saints, 8-0, after four innings and held on to win, 11-10. The league has played no games since then, and websites at codice_1 and codice_2 are both inoperative.\nExternal links.\nMore information may be found about women's baseball at:"

        "title": "Straight skeleton",
        "text": "In geometry, a straight skeleton is a method of representing a polygon by a topological skeleton. It is similar in some ways to the medial axis but differs in that the skeleton is composed of straight line segments, while the medial axis of a polygon may involve parabolic curves. However, both are homotopy-equivalent to the underlying polygon.\nStraight skeletons were first defined for simple polygons by , and generalized to planar straight-line graphs (PSLG) by .\nIn their interpretation as projection of roof surfaces, they are already extensively discussed by .\nDefinition.\nThe straight skeleton of a polygon is defined by a continuous shrinking process in which the edges of the polygon are moved inwards parallel to themselves at a constant speed. As the edges move in this way, the vertices where pairs of edges meet also move, at speeds that depend on the angle of the vertex. If one of these moving vertices collides with a nonadjacent edge, the polygon is split in two by the collision, and the process continues in each part. The straight skeleton is the set of curves traced out by the moving vertices in this process.\nIn the illustration the top figure shows the shrinking process and the middle figure depicts the straight skeleton in blue.\nAlgorithms.\nThe straight skeleton may be computed by simulating the shrinking process by which it is defined; a number of variant algorithms for computing it have been proposed, differing in the assumptions they make on the input and in the data structures they use for detecting combinatorial changes in the input polygon as it shrinks.\nThe following algorithms consider an input that forms a polygon, a polygon with holes, or a PSLG. For a polygonal input we denote the number of vertices by \"n\" and the number of reflex (concave, i.e., angle greater than ) vertices by \"r\". If the input is a PSLG then we consider the initial wavefront structure, which forms a set of polygons, and again denote by \"n\" the number of vertices and by \"r\" the number of reflex vertices w.r.t. the propagation direction. Most of the algorithms listed here are designed and analyzed in the real RAM model of computation.\nApplications.\nEach point within the input polygon can be lifted into three-dimensional space by using the time at which the shrinking process reaches that point as the z-coordinate of the point. The resulting three-dimensional surface has constant height on the edges of the polygon, and rises at constant slope from them except for the points of the straight skeleton itself, where surface patches at different angles meet. In this way, the straight skeleton can be used as the set of ridge lines of a building roof, based on walls in the form of the initial polygon. The bottom figure in the illustration depicts a surface formed from the straight skeleton in this way.\nDemaine, Demaine and Lubiw used the straight skeleton as part of a technique for folding a sheet of paper so that a given polygon can be cut from it with a single straight cut (the fold-and-cut theorem), and related origami design problems.\nBarequet et al. use straight skeletons in an algorithm for finding a three-dimensional surface that interpolates between two given polygonal chains.\nTănase and Veltkamp propose to decompose concave polygons into unions of convex regions using straight skeletons, as a preprocessing step for shape matching in image processing.\nBagheri and Razzazi use straight skeletons to guide vertex placement in a graph drawing algorithm in which the graph drawing is constrained to lie inside a polygonal boundary.\nThe straight skeleton can also be used to construct an offset curve of a polygon, with mitered corners, analogously to the construction of an offset curve with rounded corners formed from the medial axis. Tomoeda and Sugihara apply this idea in the design of signage, visible from wide angles, with an illusory appearance of depth. Similarly, Asente and Carr use straight skeletons to design color gradients that match letter outlines or other shapes.\nAs with other types of skeleton such as the medial axis, the straight skeleton can be used to collapse a two-dimensional area to a simplified one-dimensional representation of the area. For instance, Haunert and Sester describe an application of this type for straight skeletons in geographic information systems, in finding the centerlines of roads.\nEvery tree with no degree-two vertices can be realized as the straight skeleton of a convex polygon. The convex hull of the roof shape corresponding to this straight skeleton forms a Steinitz realization of the Halin graph formed from the tree by connecting its leaves in a cycle.\nHigher dimensions.\nBarequet et al. defined a version of straight skeletons for three-dimensional polyhedra, described algorithms for computing it, and analyzed its complexity on several different types of polyhedron.\nHuber et al. investigated metric spaces under which the corresponding Voronoi diagrams and straight skeletons coincide. For two dimensions, the characterization of such metric spaces is complete. For higher dimensions, this method can be interpreted as a generalization of straight skeletons of certain input shapes to arbitrary dimensions by means of Voronoi diagrams."

        "text": "The 1927 Tour de France was the 21st edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 19 June to 17 July. It consisted of 24 stages over .\nThis tour featured the first win by Nicolas Frantz, a cyclist from Luxembourg. Frantz had come in second in the previous tour, and went on to win the tour in 1928 as well. It also showcased the debuts of André Leducq (4th) and Antonin Magne (6th), two French riders who would win the Tour de France in coming years.\nBecause Tour director Henri Desgrange was dissatisfied with the tactics used in the long flat stages in the previous years, the individual team start format was introduced, similar to the later team time trial. In this concept, used in stages 1 to 9, 14 and 18 to 23, teams left fifteen minutes after each other. The concept did not make the race more interesting, so after the 1929 Tour de France, it was removed again.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1926 and previous years, in the flat stages without mountains most cyclists finished together, and the winner was determined by a bunch sprint. The Tour organisation did not like this, because they wanted the cyclists to ride individually, and have a more spectacular race. For this reason, most of the flat stages in the 1927 Tour de France were started separately, with 15 minutes in between teams, and the touriste-routiers starting last. The idea was that the stars of the race could not see their rivals, and had no choice but to ride as fast as they could on every stage.\nIn 1926, as an experiment the Tour started outside Paris, in the Alps. In 1927, this decision was reverted, and the Tour started again in Paris. The route of the 1927 Tour de France was similar to other Tours before 1926 that started in Paris, only some stages had been split, making the average stage shorter, from 338 km per stage in 1926 to 221 km per stage in 1927.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, the Alcyon-team suffered twenty punctures. The Dilecta-Wolber team won the first stage, led by Francis Pélissier, who was the first leader of the general classification.\nIn the sixth stage, Francis Pélissier abandoned sick. His teammate Ferdinand Le Drogo became the new leader. In the seventh stage, Le Drogo was in the yellow jersey in the region where he was born. His supporters cheered for him, and he got excited and sped away from his teammates. That costed him too much energy, and he lost 20 minutes in that stage to the J.B. Louvet team, so the lead was transferred to Hector Martin, from the J.B. Louvet team. In stage 8, the Dilecta team lost more than one hour, and they saw nothing left to win, and abandoned the race. At the end of stage 9, when the first group of team-time-trials stopped, there were only 57 cyclists left in the race, 35 of which were touriste-routiers, and only 22 had sponsors.\nThe first mountain stage was stage eleven. In that stage, touriste-routier Michele Gordini escaped secretly from the peloton. When the peloton found out he was away, he had already built a 45-minute advantage, and was the virtual leader of the race. Then he suffered from mechanical problems, and was passed before the end of the stage. Frantz won the stage, and took the yellow jersey.\nIn stages 12 and 13, Frantz finished in the leading group. Stage 14 was run in the team-time-trial format, and did not cause big changes in the general classification. Frantz then won the fifteenth stage and finished second in the sixteenth stage, and increased his lead to more than one hour. In the seventeenth stage, Frantz lost 15 minutes to second-placed Maurice De Waele, but because this was the last mountain stage, he had practically secured the victory.\nThe rest of the stages did not cause big changes in the general classification. The only exception was the 23rd stage, where De Waele lost more than half an hour, but his margin to the third-placed rider was large enough.\nResults.\nIn stages 1 to 9 and 18 to 23, the cyclists started in teams, each 15 minutes apart; the touriste-routiers started last. The cyclist who reached the finish fastest was the winner of the stage. In stages 10 to 17, all cyclists started together.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nOther classifications.\nThe organing newspaper, l'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Michele Gordini.\nAftermath.\nThe experiment with the team-time-trial-like stages was not considered successful; the change did not have the effect that cyclists were riding more individually, but the stronger teams became even stronger. For the 1928 Tour de France, the system was used again, but in 1929 it was reduced to a few stages, and it disappeared completely in the 1930 Tour de France.\nThe French cyclists had not been successful in the last Tours de France; they had their last overall victory in 1923, and 1926 did not even see a French stage victory. In 1927, the French cyclists had 5 stage victories, and two cyclists in the top ten: André Leducq and Antonin Magne. Leducq would later win the Tour de France in 1930 and 1932, while Magne would win the Tour de France in 1931 and 1934."

        "title": "1928 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1928 Tour de France was the 22nd edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 17 June to 15 July. It consisted of 22 stages over .\nThe Tour was won by Nicolas Frantz, his second win. He held the yellow jersey from beginning to end, despite an incident three days before the end of the race. Frantz had a mechanical failure between Metz and Charleville and had to finish 100 km of the stage on an undersized women's bicycle, resulting in a loss of 28 minutes. Regardless, Frantz won the tour, with his Alcyon team winning the team trophy and having riders finish in second and third places.\nThe 22nd tour featured the first appearance of an Australian/New Zealand team, indicating the beginning of a more international sporting field. Their experience was turned into a film by Phil Keoghan, Le Ride, released in July 2016.\nTour director Henri Desgrange allowed teams to replace exhausted or injured cyclists with new riders, to give the weaker teams a fairer chance. However, the experiment backfired, having the opposite effect, so the concept was quickly abandoned.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn the 1927 Tour de France, the team time trial format had been introduced, where teams started 15 minutes apart. This was done to make the flat stages more competitive. Although in 1927 this had not been successful, the formula was repeated in 1928; this time the teams started 10 minutes after each other.\nThe team time trial format had been an advantage to the strong teams; therefore the tour organisation invented a new rule, intended to help the weak teams: the teams were allowed to replace cyclists in the beginning of stage 12, halfway through the competition. They were not eligible for the general classification.\nAnother new concept was regional teams. The riders were separated in three groups: there were eight trade teams, nine regional teams of five riders and the touriste-routiers, without teams. Between them, the eight trade teams formed five competing units for the race. Three of them – Alcyon, Armor and Thomann, all of which had sponsorship from Dunlop – combined to compete as a single unit of ten riders. Elvish and Fontan, with Wolber sponsorship, did the same. The formidable Alcyon-Armor-Thomann combination would go on to fill the top five places overall.\nIn other years, the mountain stages, especially in the Pyrenees, had decided the race. To reduce the importance of these stages, the Tour organisation had changed the route of the first mountain stage, that had been the same since 1913. Two mountains, the Aspin and the Peyresourde, were left out of the stage.\nThe tour also saw the introduction of the Australian/New Zealand team, sponsored by Ravat. It was headed by Hubert Opperman, who had been the Australian cycling champion for a few years. After \"The Melbourne Herald\" had a campaign to send Opperman to the Tour de France, a team was made. The plan was to add six experienced European cyclists to the team, but this did not happen. Opperman rode some races in Europe and could compete with the European top cyclists, but the rest of his team could not. Because a major part of the race was in the team time trial format, Opperman had no chance to win the Tour. The Kennett Brothers wrote a book about the New Zealander on the team—Harry Watson—that was read by cycling enthusiast and \"The Amazing Race\"-host Phil Keoghan, who was surprised that he had never heard of the fellow Cantabrian before. Keoghan decided to celebrate the team's achievement and with a friend, he rode the 1928 stages on period bicycles to the original 26-day schedule. Their experience was turned into a film, \"Le Ride\", which premiered in July 2016 in Watson's home town Christchurch.\nTeams.\nAltogether, 162 cyclists started the race, a new record at that time.\nRace overview.\nIn the first team-time-trial like stages, the Alcyon team emerged the best. The individual Touriste-routiers could not compete to the professional teams. The Alcyon team finished first in five of the eight stages. Nicolas Frantz, the winner of the previous tour, crossed the finish line first in the first stage, and was leading the classification, and kept the lead during these stages. After the first eight stages, Frantz was leading the race, followed by his teammate Maurice De Waele at 99 seconds. Julien Vervaecke, the Belgian from the Armor team, followed in third place, 135 seconds behind.\nIn stage 9, the first mountain stage, Frantz did not crush the competition as he had done on previous year. Instead, Victor Fontan, who was more than one and a half hour behind in the general classification, was allowed to escape and win the stage. Frantz still finished second, seven minutes behind, and extended his lead on his direct competitors, and was now leading by more than 40 minutes.\nIn the tenth stage, the Alcyon team-mates Leducq, Frantz and De Waele finished first, and they now had the first three places in the general classification.\nNext came the alps. Here, Frantz increased his lead. Behind him, De Waele gained time on Leducq, and was now in second place. After the alps, the three Alcyon cyclists still held the first three places in the general classification, with Frantz comfortably leading by more than 75 minutes.\nIn the 19th stage, Frantz bicycle frame broke, when he rode over a railroad track. His sponsor, Alcyon, did not like the bad publicity, and wanted Frantz to go to an Alcyon dealer and get a replacement bike. The team manager from Alcyon was against this idea, because this would cause a major time loss, and maybe even the loss of the Tour de France. According to some sources, they found a bicycle shop that only had one bicycle left, an undersized women's bicycle, and they decided to take it. Other sources say that when they were thinking what to do, Frantz spotted a woman with a bicycle, and persuaded her to give him her bike. Frantz rode the last 100 km on this undersized women's bicycle, and did this with 27 km/h, whereas the winner of the stage had 34 km/h. His lead dropped with 30 minutes, but he was still leading the race.\nIn the 21st stage, Antonin Magne and Francis Bouillet had escaped together, and it was Bouillet who won the sprint. This was a problem for the Tour organisation, as Bouillet had already left the race in stage 9, to start again as a replacement in stage 12. Hence, he was no longer eligible for the general classification, and could not be the winner of a stage. The Tour organisation solved the problem by giving Bouillet the best time and proclaiming him the moral winner of the stage, and making Magne the official winner of the stage.\nResults.\nIn stages 1 to 8 and 15 to 21, the cyclists started in teams. The cyclist who reached the finish fastest was the winner of the stage. In the other stages, all cyclists started together.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added up; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nStage winners.\nNicolas Frantz wore the yellow jersey from the start of the race to the end of the race. Since the introduction of the yellow jersey in 1919, this has only happened in 1924, 1928 and 1935. As the winner of the previous year, Frantz also wore the yellow jersey during the first stage; he is the only cyclist to wear the yellow jersey during an entire Tour de France.\nGeneral classification.\nThe Alcyon team had all the podium positions. Since 1928, it has never happened again that one team had all the podium positions.\nOther classifications.\nThe organising newspaper, L'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Victor Fontan.\nThere was also a team trophy. The team trophy for teams was won by Alcyon, the Champagne-regional team won the team trophy for regional teams. This team trophy was not the same as the team classification that has been run since 1930.\nAftermath.\nThe team time trial method had not given the desired result; in the 1929 Tour de France it was only used if the previous stage had been too slow, and after 1929 it disappeared. The rule with replaced cyclists did not even make it until the next year.\nSome riders had been grouped in regional teams; this was considered successful; in 1930 the system would change to the national team system, where riders were grouped in national or regional teams."

        "text": "The 1930 Tour de France was the 24th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 2 to 27 July. It consisted of 21 stages over .\nThe 24th tour de France introduced a new format to team racing; teams were organised by country with ten riders per team. This format proved to be a very successful format for the French riders, six of which placed in the top ten. André Leducq was the star of the French team, winning the overall classification; however, Charles Pélissier, who finished ninth overall achieved a stunning eight stage wins.\n1930 was the first year of the publicity caravan.\nInnovations and changes.\nTour director Henri Desgrange had tried many things to remove the team tactics from the Tour de France, because he wanted the race to be won on individual strength. In 1929, he had removed the sponsors, but this had had no effect; the Alcyon team members still cooperated and managed to let Maurice Dewaele win the race, even though he was sick.\nFor 1930, Desgrange replaced the trade teams by national teams. He gave up on the idea that he could keep team tactics away from the Tour, but decided that he could still try to keep commercial team tactics away.\nThe race started with five national teams of eight cyclists each, completed by 60 touriste-routiers. All cyclists raced on identical, yellow-coloured bicycles.\nThe trade teams did not like the national teams, because they lost the publicity during the most important race of the season, while they still had to pay for the riders' salary. The trade teams used to supply food, transport and lodging for the cyclists during the race, but now the Tour organisation had to pay for all this. To pay for this, the publicity caravan was started. In 1930, only three companies were in that publicity caravan, but it has grown since. The most popular sponsor in the publicity was Menier chocolates, whose advertising manager had advised the Tour organisation to start the publicity caravan; 500.000 fans came to the Tour de France stages early to receive chocolate handouts.\nIn 1929, all cyclists had to do their own repairs, and had to finish with their bicycle they started with. This had caused Victor Fontan to quit the race while he was leading. In 1930, this rule was abandoned, and from now on, cyclists could get help when they had mechanical problems.\nFrom 1927 to 1929, some stages were run in the team-time-trial format. This was completely abandoned in 1930.\nThe first live radio broadcast from the Tour de France happened in 1930.\nTwo extra prizes were given in 1930, donated by the Soors brothers from \"Grand Sport\". The cyclist who led the general classification, and therefore wore the yellow jersey, received the \"Maillot d'or\" (French for \"golden jersey\"), which was 1000 francs for every stage. The best touriste-routier in the general classification received the \"Maillot d'argent\" (French for \"silver jersey\"), which was 500 francs per stage. Despite the name, there was no silver jersey worn by the best touriste-routier.\nTeams.\nFor the first time, the Tour was run with national teams. Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany and France each sent a team composed of eight cyclists. Additionally, 60 cyclists started as \"touriste-routiers\", most of them French. Some of them were grouped in regional teams.\nOne of the notable cyclists was Alfredo Binda, riding in the Italian national team. He had dominated the Giro d'Italia in the recent years, winning the 1925, 1927, 1928 and 1929 editions; in 1929 he had done so by winning eight consecutive stages. For the 1930 Giro d'Italia, he was paid money not to compete, so he started in the Tour de France that year.\nThe French team was captained by Victor Fontan, who had been leading the 1929 Tour de France until he had to abandon the race due to mechanical problems. The Belgian team had Jef Demuysere as the favourite.\nRoute and stages.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 16.\nCharles Pélissier won four stages in a row. He was the last cyclist to do this, until Mario Cipollini repeated this in 1999. Pélissier had also crossed the line first in the sixth stage, but was relegated because he had pulled Binda's jersey. He also finished in second place seven times, and finished in the top-three eighteen out of 21 times.\nPélissier was dominating the flat stages, but lost time on the mountain stages. In stage 9, he finished in fifteenth place, losing more than 23 minutes, in stage 14 he lost another 75 seconds to Leducq, and in stage 15 he lost more than 50 minutes, finishing 31st. Pélissier's eight stage victories in one Tour is still a record; it has since been equalled by Eddy Merckx in 1970 and 1974, and Freddy Maertens in 1976.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, Charles Pélissier won, and he became leader of the race, the third of the Pélissier brothers to do so. In the first stages, before the Pyrenees, the sprinters were battling for stage victories. The Italian Learco Guerra dominated the race. For the general classification, no big things happened, except for the fall of Alfredo Binda in the seventh stage, which caused him to lose one hour, and abandon his hopes for the Tour victory. Binda won the eighth and ninth stage, before he dropped out in the tenth stage.\nIn the ninth stage, touriste-routier Benoît Fauré led the race over the first mountains, and dropped many cyclists. In the end, he was dropped by Binda, Leducq, Pierre Magne and Antonin Magne.\nIn the sixteenth stage, going down from the Galibier, the leader of the race André Leducq fell down. He lost consciousness, and when he woke up, Pierre Magne put him back on his bicycle, and his French teammates helped him to get back. Learco Guerra, second placed in the general classification with a margin of more than 16 minutes, saw an opportunity and was away as fast as he could, together with Jef Demuysere. Just before the climb of the Col du Télégraphe, Leducq's pedal broke. His teammate Marcel Bidot got a pedal from a spectator's bicycle. Leducq thought of abandoning the race, but he was convinced by his teammates to get back on his bicycle. They had 60 km to go, and managed to get back to Guerra. In the end, Leducq even managed to win the sprint.\nWith no more mountain stages to come, Leducq had secured his victory. Charles Pélissier made the victory of the French team even more glorious, as he won the last four stages.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nIn all stages, all cyclists started together. The cyclist to reach the finish first was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added together; the cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe touriste-routiers had been divided into regional teams, for which a separate team classification was made. The South-East team became the winner of this classification. For \"touriste-routiers\", cyclists that were not part of national teams, there were additional awards. The best-placed touriste-routier received a prize, but was not identified by a jersey. Some of the touriste-routiers were assigned to a regional team. A regional team classification was also made, according to the same rules as the national team classification.\nThe organing newspaper, l'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Benoît Fauré.\nFor the first time, there was a team competition. The team classification was calculated in 1930 by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per national team; the national team with the least time was the winner. The team competition for national teams was won by the French team.\nAftermath.\nThe national team format was considered successful by the Tour organisation. It also helped that a French cyclist won the race, which increased newspaper sales for the organising news paper l'Auto. The national team format was kept in the coming years, and only reverted to the trade team system in 1962 temporarily and 1969 permanently."

        "text": "The Grand Challenge Cup is a rowing competition for men's eights. It is the oldest and best-known event at the annual Henley Royal Regatta on the River Thames at Henley-on-Thames in England. It is open to male crews from all eligible rowing clubs. Two or more clubs may combine to make an entry.\nThe event dates from 1839 and was originally called the \"Henley Grand Challenge Cup\". The Stewards resolved that a silver cup, for which they incurred 100 guineas, was to be competed for annually by amateur crews in eight-oared boats. One of the prize medals awarded at the first race was donated to the regatta in 1969 and is on display in the Prize Tent.\nThe cup has since been competed for annually save for the years affected by the two World Wars and the COVID-19 pandemic. The eligibility rules have varied over the years, but the premise that the cup has always been open to all established crews has remained at its core. Subject to rowing together long enough, F.I.S.A. national crew members may enter for this event. In its history the Cup has been won by foreign crews 47 times – 14 times by crews from Germany, 11 from the US, 9 from the former USSR, 4 times each by crews from Australia and Canada, 3 times by Belgian crews, twice by a Dutch crew and once each by crews from Bulgaria, Croatia, France and Switzerland. The Leander Club hold the record of 36 wins.\nThe cup itself records the names of all winning crews since 1839. The base was added in 1896 and extended in 1954 and again in 1986. The Book of Honour was added as an integral part of the trophy in 1954. In 1964, the winning Harvard crew of 1914 presented the regatta with a new cup, identical to the original of 1839, which is now very fragile. This new cup continues to be used as the trophy presented to the winning crew for lifting and photographs on finals day, with medals as in all other events being awarded permanently to winners.\nThe current Henley course record is set by the winning 2018 entry."

        "text": "Richard Alfred Dunn (1920–2006) was an Australian rugby league footballer and coach in the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership (NSWRFL).\nPlaying career.\nDunn played 148 matches for the Eastern Suburbs club in the years (1938–47). A local junior of that club, Dunn grew up idolising the senior players, carrying the kit bags of legends like Dave Brown and Ray Stehr; a few years later he was playing alongside of them. Dunn played most of his career in the s though in later years he moved to . Dunn played in four premiership deciders in his career, winning in 1940 and 1945.\nDunn is best remembered for the 1945 Grand Final in which he scored 19 of East's 22 points, a record that still stands today for the most points scored in a premiership decider. In an interview with Sean Fagan, Dunn recalls the final minutes of the match –\n “Yes well the situation was this, the game was very, very close. They led us 10 to 5 at half time and were playing a mighty game of football. \nThe scores and play fluctuated and they led us with about four minutes to go by 18 to 17. We got a penalty on the half way line and Ray Stehr [captain] says \"kick for the sideline\". Wally O'Connell, who played in the game will verify this of course, he was closest to me. Stehr says \"which side you going to kick, so I'll go over?\" I said \"Don't you want the two points - it'll put us in front!\" He said \"Its too far for you to kick it.\" \nAnyway, I had a little bit of trouble in getting the ball onto a mound. In those days there was no sand or anything like that to assist and I couldn't make a mound from the hardness of the centre, you know, the cricket pitch. So I said to Georgie Watt I'm going to kick this \"Lomas style\" - that's an upright position of the ball you know, standing up? He said \"Oh you couldn't kick that Lomas style.\" \nAnd ah of course as soon as it left my boot, I thought this a goer for sure. Some say it landed in the crowd. I know it landed well over the bloody post because we did have a bit of excitement by kicking it - we were winning! \nIronically, when Balmain kicked off I anticipated Jorgenson's kick - he was a great footballer and a great goal kicker, probably a lot better than me. I said to myself he'll kick this right here, which was the 25 yard line. But of course even with us having possession of the ball there could have been a scrum and something could have happened, maybe they could've kicked 2 points with a field goal and all that. \nAnyway, sure enough, I've caught the ball fortunately and this is the truth and actual facts - I punted it from our own 25 to find the line 5 yards from the corner post under the SCG scoreboard! Right? We won the scrum against the feed and this is where Lisle and O'Connell put a move on that, I'm not quite sure what the name of the move was, any rate, they went bang, bang, bang and fortunately they just passed me the ball and I scored in the corner and that really won the game. It was 22-18 with about 10 seconds to play.\nKicking for the conversion goal and I've always said it, people say \"ah your bull!\", I'm kicking for the goal and in my opinion no chance of missing. I had a lot of confidence and I went into the ball and just before I got into the ball the bell rang for full time you know. And it just put me off and grazed the outside upright so there was two more I would've scored!” .\nPost playing.\nFollowing his retirement from the game as a player he became a prominent administrator, serving as vice president of the NSWRL and chairman of rugby league's judiciary panel. He was also the coach of Easts in 1960, losing to St George in that year's Grand Final. For his services, Dunn was made a life member of the Eastern Suburbs, the NSWRL and Australian Rugby League (ARL) and was a recipient of an Order of Australia O.A.M for his services to Rugby League. He was also coach of the New South Wales team in the 1960s. He was granted a life membership of Eastern Suburbs Rugby League, because as a director of the Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club, he was one of the original directors who negotiated the site of the present Rugby League club which had originally started when Dunn was the social secretary of Easts in the 1950s in two little rooms at the northern end of the promenade at Bondi Beach. Later functions were held at the Bondi Pavilion and then at a hotel at Bondi Junction. Eastern Suburbs Leagues Club had humble beginnings and if not for men like Dick Dunn and his fellow directors, like Bob Stuart and others, the \"Roosters\" or boys from Bondi as they are now known may never have had a club to celebrate their victories.\nDunn was also a sergeant in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) stationed firstly at Scheyville NSW as a searchlights operator and later in the Transport Corps near Newcastle.\nHe worked as manager of the Morley Johnson's store opposite Sydney Town Hall - whose motto was \"everything for the home\" from age 16. He met his wife Margaret at the store. After Morley Johnsons closed its doors in the 1960s, Dunn worked for Miles Furniture and retired at 65 to spend more time with his beloved wife (who died in 1990).\nAt the time of his death in 2006, Dunn was age 86."

In the past, the tournament was played as a league system, where the teams were split into divisions. The competition was designed to encourage and develop the best players in countries where cricket was not a major sport and Europe's only Test cricket playing country at the time, England, did not enter a full-strength side. The games were often played as 50-over one-day cricket matches.\nHistory.\nThe European Cricket Championships began in 1996 as a competition for seven European associate teams and an (English Cricket Board) ECB XI. The second installment, two years later, saw the two new associate members, France and Germany join them and the competition played over two divisions.\nIn 2000, places were given to the top finishers of the European Affiliates Championship and this continued over the following installments. Promotion and relegation between divisions was not introduced until 2004.\nWith the introduction of the ICC World Cricket League in 2006, the championship was revamped. The European Affiliates Championship was incorporated into the European Cricket Championships with the teams being split between Divisions Two, Three and Four according to the placement in the final competition. Additionally, the ECB XI was no longer included and only full national sides could take part. A fifth league was introduced in 2009–10 season containing some of the newest affiliate members of the European Cricket Council, but discontinued thereafter, along with Division 4.

Italy were absent, having been promoted to Division One. Greece made their return to Division Two after a six-year absence, whilst the tournament saw the international debuts of Guernsey and Jersey. It was won by Norway, who were promoted to 2008 Division One. The win also granted them entry into 2008 WCL Division Five alongside runners-up Jersey and 3rd place Germany.

The team was organised by the Chinese Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2004 and an associate member in 2017. China did not make its debut in international cricket until the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, although the Shanghai Cricket Club had previously acted as a \"de facto\" national side, from 1866 playing interport matches against international teams. China has since participated in several other Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournaments, as well as at the 2010 and 2014 Asian Games cricket events. Hong Kong (a Special Administrative Region of China) and Taiwan (claimed as China's 23rd province) both field separate teams in international cricket. \nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between China and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nHistory.\nBetween 1858 and 1948, the Shanghai Cricket Club, the largest club in the country, playing games against many touring sides, but it was not recognised as an official national team.\nSince September 2005, the Chinese Cricket Association has conducted eight coaching/umpiring training courses with assistance from the Asian Cricket Council. The sport is now played in nine cities in China, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Shenyang, Dalian, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Tianjin and Jinan. More than 150 schools have been involved.\nChina took part in the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, their first appearance in a representative tournament. The Chinese lost all of their group matches, including against Iran and the Maldives where they lost by 307 and 315 runs respectively. In the seventh-place playoff, China recorded their first-ever international win when they beat Myanmar by 118 runs.\nChina took part in the 2014 ACC Twenty20 Cup in the United Arab Emirates. The team lost their first game against Afghanistan by 9 wickets after being bowled out for just 37. China lost all five of their group games by wide margins, including a record low total and record margin of defeat in a representative Twenty20 match when they lost to the United Arab Emirates by 209 runs after conceding 236 runs during the UAE's innings and then in reply were bowled out for 27 runs, with 15 of those runs coming in extras. They lost to Bahrain in the eleventh place playoff, thus finishing the tournament in twelfth and last place.\nChina participated in the 2010 Asian Games where, as host, it played against Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.\nChina played their first T20I on 26 July 2023, against Malaysia, during the 2023 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier.\nIn the same tournament, China defeated Myanmar in their last match to register their first-ever win in T20Is.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary\n\"Last updated 16 February 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2476.

        "text": "The Production Line was a nickname for one of the most famous scoring lines in the history of the National Hockey League (NHL). The line consisted of Gordie Howe (right wing), Sid Abel (centre) and Ted Lindsay (left wing) of the Detroit Red Wings, all members of the Hockey Hall of Fame.\nIn 1947, Tommy Ivan replaced Jack Adams as head coach of the Wings and instantly put the two best players on the squad (Howe and Lindsay) on either side of the future Hall of Famer Abel. Abel was in the twilight of his career but Ivan knew that he could still be a threat with two lightning fast wingers that could cover for his slowness and bring out the best in him. Howe and Lindsay were the best of friends with both having immense respect for Sid. The trio would often stay late after practice and fool around with the puck. The fooling around paid off, as the trio would perfect one of hockey's greatest plays—the set play. To take advantage of the speed of the wingers and to minimize the problems of having a slow center, the wingers would shoot the puck into the opponents' end after crossing center ice. They would angle their shoot-in so that the puck would bounce off the boards and slide to the front of the goal where the other winger could get to it. That winger would either make a quick pass to Abel in the slot or take a shot himself. It was a brilliant play for the era because goalies of the period rarely left the goal crease, and would not think to cut off the shoot-in or block the pass in front. The trio also found numerous other ways to hit the back of net off their ability to read each other and come together as a unit.\nIn the 1947–48 season, the trio was tops on the team in scoring and in 1949–50, when Lindsay won the scoring crown with 78 points, the three finished 1–2–3 in NHL scoring, a feat never again rivaled, and the Red Wings won the Stanley Cup. The year after, Howe won his first of four consecutive Art Ross Trophies. Howe would also finish in the top five in scoring for the next 20 seasons. When Howe retired from the NHL in 1971, he held virtually every scoring record in the NHL.\nBoth fans and media scrambled to come up with a catchy nickname for the threesome and soon enough, somebody coined a term that described the importance of the line to the team as well as a reference to Detroit, the car-making capital of the United States. The Production Line was born.\nProduction Line II.\nAfter the 1951–52 season, Sid Abel was traded to the Chicago Black Hawks to make room for another talented, albeit younger, center. Alex Delvecchio joined the team and continued to dominate the league as the center of the famed \"Production Line II\". Prior to Delvecchio establishing himself as a number one center, Norm Ullman and Earl Reibel took turns centering Lindsay and Howe.\nProduction Line III.\nIn the late 1960s, Frank Mahovlich replaced the retired Ted Lindsay at wing for another iteration of the Production Line."

        "text": "John Van Buskirk Hatfield (July 20, 1847 – February 20, 1909) was an American professional baseball player in the 1860s and 1870s. He was a batting star and versatile fielder for the Mutual Base Ball Club (New York Mutuals) both before and after spending the 1868 season as left fielder for Harry Wright's Cincinnati Red Stockings. Left field was his primary position during four years as a regular player in the major leagues from 1871. For a few decades after leaving the game he was famous for his \"world record\" long-distance throw. During an 1868 exhibition at Cincinnati's Union Grounds he threw the baseball 132 yards (396 feet). On October 15, 1872 Hatfield threw a baseball 400 feet.\nRevolver.\nJohn Hatfield's season in Cincinnati was the last of the amateur era. Like Fred Waterman, another import from New York, he must have been compensated by members of the Cincinnati club if not by the club itself. He was already famous for \"revolving\" or changing his membership from one club to another. After playing much of two seasons for the New York Gothams to the Actives in September 1865 and played for two other clubs before the end of that season, probably in November. He played mainly for the Actives in 1866 and joined the New York Mutuals for 1867 (Ryczek 1998, 141). That club was always one of the strongest and by Hatfield's time one of the leaders on the frontier of professionalism. Boss Tweed was a member of the club and it was able to compensate some players with city jobs.\nLate in 1868 Hatfield missed a match with Cincinnati's intercity rival, the Buckeyes, when a defeat would have required a third game to decide the local championship. After Cincinnati won without him, it came out that he had been benched by his club following a seamy incident the night before. Gamblers had \"plied him with liquor, and offered him $200 plus a job in the assessor's office if he would desert the Red Stockings and immediately become captain of the Buckeyes.\" He had admitted the scheme, but plead intoxication and asked to continue playing with the Red Stockings. They returned him to good standing sometime after the big game.\nAt the same time, the Buckeyes had hired three outside players for the big game. Like the Red Stockings, they had improved their team before the season by importing some eastern stars. Apparently many player engagements were agreed by contracts of some kind, although little is known about the details. At its annual meeting that December, the National Association expressly permitted professional clubs and thus employment contracts for players.\nFor the first professional season John Hatfield signed a contract to play with Cincinnati again, but he later signed also with his prior club the Mutuals, and he returned to New York leaving debts in the Queen City.\nProfessional.\nHatfield remained with the Mutuals for his remaining six seasons as a regular player, 1869–1874 including 1870 as team captain. Thereafter he played only two stray games at that level.\nJohn Hatfield died 1909 in Long Island City at age 61. He is buried in Mount Olivet Cemetery, Maspeth. (Both Long Island City and Maspeth are now in the New York City borough of Queens.)"

He attended and swam for West Liberty State College in West Liberty, Virginia, now West Liberty University, and in 1971 was named to the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics All-American team. In that year, he helped lead West Liberty swimmers to the conference title, taking 15 of 17 events and finishing the season 11-3. After graduating college in 1975, he served as a Swimming and Cross Country Coach at the Linsly School, a prep school in Wheeling, Virginia, only twelve miles from West Liberty State. \nArkansas Dolphins Swim team coach.\nBlair was known around the world for his sprinting methods, which became apparent through the accomplishments of his swim team, the Arkansas Dolphins, based in Little Rock, Arkansas which he coached from 1979-2006. \nBlair was one of the early coaches to emphasize the need for sprinters to have timed intervals to complete swim distances similar to the distances they would swim in competitions or somewhat longer, as the foundation for their workout sessions. This method would balance sprints with rest intervals to improve primarily speed, but would also benefit technique and endurance.

The main feature of the year was the seventh season of the Bartercard Cup competition that was run by the New Zealand Rugby League. The Auckland Lions won the Cup by defeating the Canterbury Bulls 25–18 in the grand final.\nInternational competitions.\nThe New Zealand national rugby league team co-hosted the Tri-Nations with Australia. Three tests were played in New Zealand; with the Kiwis defeating Great Britain 18–14 in Christchurch and 34–4 in Wellington and losing to Australia 18–30 in Auckland. New Zealand lost the final, which was played in Sydney, 16–12 to Australia after Golden Point extra time.

        "text": "Charles \"Chook\" Fraser (1893–1981) was an Australian rugby league footballer and later coach. He was a versatile three-quarter for the Australian national team. He played in 11 Tests between 1911 and 1920 as captain on 3 occasions. He is considered one of the nation's finest footballers of the 20th century\nBalmain.\nChook Fraser was born in Short Street, Birchgrove in 1893. A Balmain junior, Fraser was graded with the Balmain Tigers at age 17, before an extraordinary seventeen year first grade career for the club at either fullback or centre from 1910 to 1926.\nHe was member of Balmain's premiership winning sides of 1915, 1916, 1917, 1919, 1920 and 1924. His 185 first grade games stood as the Balmain club record for more than four decades. He was the NSW Rugby Football League's top point scorer in 1916 and 1917.\nHe was selected in both the Wests Tigers Team of the Century and the Balmain Tigers Team of the Century in the position of centre.\nRepresentative career.\nIn only his second year in first grade with just 15 games to his credit and still aged 18, Fraser was selected for the 1911–12 Kangaroo Tour of England. He made his Test debut at full-back against England in the 1st Test of 1911 at Newcastle upon Tyne and played in twenty other tour matches. He was the youngest Australian footballer to play Test football (18 years 301 days) when he toured with the 1911–12 Kangaroos until surpassed by Brad Fittler in 1990 and then by Israel Folau in 2007.\nHe made his state debut for New South Wales in 1912 against New Zealand. He made a further nine state appearances during his career against Queensland or visiting International sides.\nHe made ten further Test appearances (at home against the 1914 and 1920 Lions, while touring New Zealand in 1919 and then on his second Kangaroo tour of 1921–22, with fellow Balmain players Reg Latta, Jimmy Craig and Bill Schultz playing seven times at full-back and three times at five-eighth. The 1919 touring side of New Zealand was the first Australian full Test side to cross the Tasman. With the world still recovering from World War I and in the midst of the deadly Spanish flu pandemic, the team could only find passage to New Zealand on a cockroach and rat-infested cargo ship out of Newcastle harbour. Half-way across the Tasman, bites from the ship-bred vermin led to Fraser and Duncan Thompson falling victim to blood-poisoned legs.\nHis first appearance as captain of the Kangaroos was the first test of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain. He led the side in all three Tests of that series.\nPost-playing.\nHe coached Balmain on two separate occasions.\nHe coached a Gundagai side to success in a country competition in 1926 before returning to coach the Balmain Tigers in 1932. He remained involved with the Balmain club in the 1950s and 1960s as a talent scout and lived at Dock Road, Balmain with wife Veronica for the rest of his long life. He told Tom Goodman in the Sun Herald in 1978, \"I'm 85 but I'm still a fan. I never miss a game at Leichhardt and I go to the S.C.G. for all the big games.\" In the same article Fraser stated that Dally Messenger was greatest player he had ever seen play Rugby League.\nChook Fraser's favourite hobby was sailing. He was a life member of the 18 footer sailing league in Sydney, and was a crew member of several noted boats and skiffs of his era. Charles' third son Jim, also an avid sailor, went on to win the 18-footers World Championship in 1958 sailing in \"Jantzen Girl.\"\nChook Fraser died at Birchgrove in 1981, age 88. He was survived by six children, 17 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, and was buried at Field of Mars Cemetery on 3 February 1981.\nIn 2006, Fraser was inducted into the Australian Rugby League Hall of Fame. In February 2008, Fraser was named in the list of Australia's \"100 Greatest Players\" (1908–2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia."

In a six-game series, the Monarchs swept the Grays four games to none, with two additional games not counted in the standings. The Monarchs actually won the 1942 series 5-1, but a second game played in Yankee Stadium on September 13 (a seven-inning victory by the Monarchs) was not counted by prior agreement, and the only game played in Kansas City was thrown out on appeal when the Grays used unauthorized players from other NNL teams.\nIt was the first World Series between eastern and western Negro leagues champions since , resuming after a 14-year lapse since the collapse of the Eastern Colored League had ended the previous post-season meetings. The series featured eight members of the Baseball Hall of Fame, four each from the Monarchs (Satchel Paige, Hilton Smith, Buck O'Neil, and Willard Brown) and the Grays (Josh Gibson, Jud Wilson, Ray Brown, and Buck Leonard). One additional Hall of Famer, Leon Day, played in one of the games that was not counted, Monarchs legend Bullet Rogan umpired in that same game.\nThe Monarchs and Grays had met during the regular season in two exhibition games, in which the Grays had twice defeated Monarch ace Satchel Paige in extra innings. Some of the pre-Series publicity had concentrated on whether Paige would be seeking revenge for his losses or whether the Grays truly held a \"jinx\" over him and would continue to dominate him. Paige pitched in all four official games and earned one victory and one save in a series that saw four official games, an exhibition game, and a game called due to protest.\nThis was the Grays' first appearance ever in the Negro World Series, though this was their third consecutive NNL pennant, and fifth in six seasons. They would appear in the next three CWS, winning in 1943 and '44. It was the third appearance by the Monarchs (going back to 1924) in the CWS, their second championship, and their fifth NAL pennant in six seasons. They would appear one more time, losing to the Newark Eagles in 1946.\nSummary.\nManagers: Frank Duncan (Kansas City); Vic Harris (Washington-Homestead)\nMatchups.\nGame One.\nSeptember 8, 1942, at Griffith Stadium in Washington, DC\nGame Two.\nSeptember 10, 1942, at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh\nGame Three.\nSeptember 13, 1942, at Yankee Stadium in New York\nGames not counted in Series.\nSeptember 13, 1942 (game 2) at Yankee Stadium in New York\nSeptember 20, 1942, at Ruppert Stadium in Kansas City\nSeptember 27, 1942, at Wrigley Field in Chicago\nGame Four.\nSeptember 29, 1942, at Shibe Park in Philadelphia"

        "title": "France men's national handball team",
        "text": "The France national handball team is supervised by the French Handball Federation, and represents France in international matches. It is the first handball team to have held all three titles twice (the Danish women's team also held all three in 1997), and the only national team in its sport to hold six world titles and a total of eleven medals at the World Men's Handball Championship. With a total of five medals, including three gold in 2008, 2012 and 2021, France is also the most successful Handball team at the Summer Olympics. As of January 2024, they are the defending Olympic and European Champions.\nFrance's men handball team is widely regarded as one of the finest national teams in the history of the sport.\nResults at international tournaments.\nSince the 1990s, France has emerged as a major handball team. France won the bronze medal in the 1992 Summer Olympics, giving birth to their first nickname: \"les Bronzés\" (meaning tanned in French, a reference both to bronze and to cult French film Les Bronzés). This led to an increased popularity of the sport in France, which was already one of the most popular in primary and secondary schools.\nOne year after their Olympic medal, \"les Bronzés\" reached the final of the 1993 World Championship, which they lost against Russia.\nIn 1995, France won the World Championship in Iceland, defeating Croatia in the final. The team became known as \"les Barjots\" because the players played the final with an extravagant haircut (\"barjot\" is a slang word for \"crazy\" in French).\nThe team finished 4th in the 1996 Summer Olympics (France lost the bronze medal game to Spain, whom they had beaten in the first round). France finished third a year later in the 1997 World Championship. The team finished 6th in the 1999 World Championship and in the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nFrance won the world title again in the 2001 World Championship organised in France. During both their quarterfinal and final, against Germany and Sweden respectively, they were one goal behind until a few seconds before the end of the game, but scored a late goal and finally win in overtime with a three-goal margin. This great strength of character was cause for their new nickname: \"les Costauds\" (the strong, or the tough). Five members of \"les Costauds\" had already been world champions in 1995 with \"les Barjots\": Jackson Richardson, Grégory Anquetil, Patrick Cazal, and the goalkeepers Bruno Martini and Christian Gaudin.\nThe team finished third in the 2003 World Championship. In the 2004 Olympics, the teamed finished 5th. Although they won their five games of the preliminary round, the team lost to an ageing Russian team led by 42-year-old goalkeeper Andrey Lavrov in the quarterfinals (24–26).\nIn the 2005 World Championship, France finished third again. This was the last international competition played by Jackson Richardson, a veteran from the first team \"les Bronzés\". The retirement of their star meant for the French team the final transition between the early successes and the new generation of players.\nIn 2006 France won for the first time the European Championship, a competition in which they had never won a medal until then. In the final, they overwhelmed Spain, the reigning world champions (31–23), against whom they had lost the opening match in the preliminary round.\nIn 2008, France finished third in the European Championship. They were undefeated until the semi-final, which they lost to Croatia.\nFrance won the gold medal in the Beijing Olympics. The French players elected to call themselves \"Les Experts\", which is the French title for the TV show in France. The team won the gold medal in the 2008 handball tournament in Beijing, defeating underdogs Iceland in the final (28–23). Thierry Omeyer, Daniel Narcisse and Bertrand Gille were voted into the tournament's All Star team.\nFrance won the world title again in 2009 at the 2009 World Championship, hosted by Croatia, against the organizing country, and the European title in 2010 in Austria, once more against Croatia. As a result, they became the first men's team to hold the three major titles in the sport (olympic title, world title and European title) simultaneously (Denmark women's national handball team held all three titles in 1997). It also became the third team to have won all three titles ever, the other two being Germany and Russia.\nIn the 2011 World Championship, France held its title, winning against Denmark (37–35 after extra time). This victory, in addition to granting an automatic participation to the 2012 Olympics, marked several achievements:\nThe 2012 and 2013 years were a mixed bag for the team; after an unexpected setback at the 2012 European championship where the team ended up in 11th place, it went on to be the first national handball team to retain the Olympic title at the London Olympic games. In 2013, they ended up being defeated by Croatia in this year's world championship.\n2014 saw France regain its European title after losing it in 2012. Of note is that just like in 2009, the team ended up winning the final against the host country.\nIn 2015, they won their 5th World Champion title against host country Qatar. Thierry Omeyer was elected Most Valuable Player of the tournament; this was the first time in the IHF history that a goalkeeper was elected as an MVP. By doing so, they became the first team in the history of the sport to hold the three major titles for the second time.\nIn 2016, Les Experts lost their Olympic title in Rio, finishing second after a defeat in final against Denmark.\nIn 2017, they won their 6th World Champion title at home against Norway (33–26). Nikola Karabatic was elected Most Valuable Player of the tournament. Thierry Omeyer and Daniel Narcisse retired after the tournament, with two Olympic gold medals, three European titles, and respectively five and four world championship titles.\nCompetitive record.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth place  \nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the 2024 European Men's Handball Championship.\nHead coach: Guillaume Gille\nKit suppliers.\nSince 2002, France's kit is supplied by Adidas."

        "title": "Rugby Special",
        "text": "Rugby Special was the main rugby union programme on the BBC in the UK. The show ran from 1966 and past presenters included David Vine, Keith Macklin, Cliff Morgan, Chris Rea, Nigel Starmer-Smith, Bill Beaumont and John Inverdale. The main commentators were Bill McLaren, Cliff Morgan, Nigel Starmer-Smith, David Parry-Jones, Martyn Williams, Lynn Davies, Jim Neilly and Eddie Butler.\nFrom the start of the 1994/95 season, the programme was contracted out to an independent production company Chrysalis after 28 years as an in-house BBC production. John Inverdale replaced Chris Rea as host at this time.\nThe programme ended its original run in 1997 after losing the rights to cover English domestic games, then known as the Allied Dunbar Premiership, to Channel 5, who showed highlights on a programme titled \"Rugby Express\". After one season, the rights to the English Premiership again moved to Channel 4 who showed highlights on Saturday mornings in a programme titled \"Inside Rugby\".\nThe programme returned on late Thursday nights in 2002 but was discontinued in 2005, when it was a highlights programme of Autumn internationals and Six Nations with studio guests and an audience of fans from the Six Nations. But when the Premiership highlights rights were regained from the 2001–02 season highlights were shown on \"Sunday Grandstand\".\n\"Rugby Special\" returned to the BBC on 7 February 2016, covering the highlights of Six Nations. The programme returned in 2023 again covering highlights of the Six Nations.\nTheme music.\nIn the early seventies, the theme tune was \"Spinball\" by Paddy Kingsland but this was later replaced by \"Holy Mackerel\" by The Shadows' drummer, Brian Bennett which was replaced for one season 1988–89 by the Kenny G version of \"What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)\" from the 1986 Duotones album replaced from 1989–90 to 1993–94 by a specially commissioned theme.\nRegional opt out versions.\nFrom the 1986–87 season, BBC2 Wales, BBC2 Scotland and BBC Two Northern Ireland started their own regional versions. These programmes went out at the same time as the main version broadcast in England from London. The BBC2 England version would still show one or two club games from Wales and Scotland as a second or third match.\nPreviously, Wales Rugby Union highlights had been broadcast on BBC1 Wales on Sunday Afternoons under the \"Sports Line-Up\" title, and later as \"Weekend Rugby Union\" with David Parry-Jones as presenter and commentator. He would carry on as presenter when Martyn Williams took over the commentator role with Phil Bennett as co-commentator. When the Rugby Union highlights moved to BBC2 Wales, it became known as \"Rugby Special Wales\" with David Parry-Jones and Martyn Williams continuing in the roles in the first season. For 1987/88, Alan Wilkins became the presenter though he would also deputise as a commentator when Martyn Williams wasn't available with Martyn Williams as the main commentator and Phil Bennett in the commentary box until the end of the 1988–89 season. Lynn Davies took over as commentator from the 1989–90 season and carried on until 1995, again with Phil Bennett as co-commentator when it would become \"Scrum V\" where he would continue as commentator until 1998 when Huw Llywelyn Davies would take over the English Language commentator role for a short time before returning to his Welsh Language commentator role on S4C.\nThe Scottish programme went out as \"Rugby Special from Scotland\" with Bill Johnstone presenting in the late 1980s until the mid-1990s, when the programme was now aired under the \"Sportscene\" banner as \"Sportscene Rugby Special\" and at this point the presenters was Mark Souster until he was replaced by Jill Douglas in the late 1990s and in the programme's final year, former rugby player John Beattie took over hosting duties with Gary Parker co-hosting with John around the early 2000s. The commentator for all live matches and highlights was Bill McLaren.\nThe Northern Ireland version mostly covered matches involving Ulster Rugby and was a co-production with RTE due to the fact that Rugby Union in Ireland is governed on a United Ireland basis under the Irish Rugby Football Union banner. The commentators were Jim Neilly and Fergus Slattery."

The team is organised by the Chilean Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 and an associate member in 2017. However, the national side had debuted as early as 1893, when it played Argentina in Santiago. Chile began playing regular international matches in the early 1920s, and, with the exception of a gap during World War II, has continued to do so. Until the team affiliated to the ICC, its opponents were almost all other South American teams. It first participated in an ICC tournament in 2006, when it fielded a team in division three of the 2006 ICC Americas Championship. In the South American Championships, which began in 1995, Chile has participated in every edition, but won only twice, in 2011 &amp; 2016.\nHistory.\nCricket was first played in the country in 1829 and the first club, the Valparaíso Cricket Club was formed in 1860. Their first international fixture was played in 1893 against Argentina. Chile provided two players to the South American combined cricket team which toured England in 1932 (playing several first-class matches) – Alfred Jackson and Charles Sutton.\nInterest in the game had waned after the Second World War, although a national side continued to play regular matches, and Chile did not become a member of the International Cricket Council until 2002. .\nTheir first ICC tournament was the Division Three tournament of the ICC Americas Championship, played in Suriname in February 2006. Coached by Arjun Menon, the Chileans finished in third place, their only win coming against Brazil.\nThe February 2008 edition of the Division 3 tournament was held in Argentina. Chile defeated Belize, Turks &amp; Caicos Islands and Peru only to lose to Brazil. Chile finished the tournament second due to net run rate.\nChile has participated in every edition of the South American Championship since it was first held in 1995, and hosted it twice. It won the tournament in 2016 and 2011, and has been runner-up on six other occasions.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Chile and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nChile played their first T20I match against Brazil on 3 October 2019 during the 2019 South American Cricket Championship in Peru\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Chile\n\"Last updated 20 October 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Chile\nMost T20I wickets for Chile\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2323.

        "text": "The 1988 Giro d'Italia was the 71st running of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tour races. The race started in Urbino, on 23 May, with a individual time trial and concluded in Vittorio Veneto, on 12 June, with a individual time trial. A total of 180 riders from 20 teams entered the 21-stage race, which was won by American Andrew Hampsten of the team. The second and third places were taken by Dutchman Erik Breukink and Swiss Urs Zimmermann, respectively. It was the third time – and second successive year – in the history of the Giro that the podium was occupied solely by non-Italian riders.\nIn the first half of the race, the overall classification had been headed for several days by Massimo Podenzana. He had participated in a breakaway during stage 4a, which won him sufficient time to hold the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" () for more than a week. Franco Chioccioli then wore the pink jersey for two stages before Hampsten took the general classification lead after the fourteenth stage. The fourteenth stage of the 1988 Giro, conducted in adverse weather including a snowstorm, has been recognized as an iconic event in the history of the Giro. After this stage, Hampsten began to build up a solid two-minute barrier against the second-placed rider, Breukink. This gap was sufficient to win Hampsten the race, despite losing around twenty seconds in the final two stages.\nHampsten became the first American, and non-European, to win the Giro. He also won the secondary mountains and combination classifications, as well as the special sprints classification. In the other classifications, Fanini–Seven Up rider Stefano Tomasini of Italy placed ninth overall to finish as the best neo-professional in the general classification, Johan van der Velde of the Gisgelati–Ecoflam team was the winner of the points classification, and finished as the winners of the team classification.\nTeams.\nTwenty teams were invited by the race organizers to participate in the 1988 edition of the Giro d'Italia, twelve of which were based outside of Italy. Each team sent a squad of nine riders, which meant that the race started with a peloton of 180 cyclists. In total, 82 of the starters were foreign, while the remaining 98 were Italian. Aside from Italy, Switzerland (17), Spain (12), and the Netherlands (11) all had more than 10 riders. \nOf those starting, 54 were riding the Giro d'Italia for the first time. The average age of riders was 26.94 years, ranging from 21–year–old Angelo Lecchi from Del Tongo–Colnago to 37–year–old Pierino Gavazzi of Fanini–Seven Up. The team with the youngest average rider age was Selca–Ciclolinea (25), while the oldest was (29). The presentation of the teams – where each team's roster and manager were introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place on 22 May, in the courtyard of the Ducal Palace in Urbino. From the riders that began the race, 125 made it to the finish in Vittorio Veneto.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favorites.\nThe starting peloton did not include the 1987 winner, Stephen Roche, who was sidelined for the majority of the 1988 season with a knee injury. \"l'Unità\" writer Gino Sala, author Bill McGann and an \"El Mundo Deportivo\" writer named several riders as contenders for the overall classification, including Andrew Hampsten, Urs Zimmermann, Erik Breukink, Franco Chioccioli, and Pedro Delgado. Sala believed Jean-François Bernard came into the Giro in great shape and that the French rider could win the race if he could do well in the time trials and the mountains. In addition, Bernard Hinault told Sala that if Jean Francois could do well in this edition of the Giro, he could one day lead a team in the Tour de France. Former Giro champion Gianni Motta thought Hampsten would win because of the effort he was expected to make on the Gavia Pass stage. Motta believed that Hampsten would excel there, while the Italian riders – the majority of the peloton – would not because they did not realize its difficulty and thought the Gavia was \"just another climb\".\nThe 1986 Tour de France winner Greg LeMond entered the race with his squad, after a break from cycling due to injuries sustained in a . Due to this, Sala did not see him as a front-runner for the overall victory. Swiss rider Tony Rominger also partook in the race and was considered by McGann and Sala as a dark-horse candidate for the victory after experiencing success at the beginning of his season. Guido Bontempi was seen by Sala as a favorite to win a couple of stages. Before he injured his right knee earlier in the season during the Tour de Romandie, many newspapers also believed Moreno Argentin to be a favorite to take several stages. \"Stampa Sera\" writer Curzio Maltese believed that Flavio Giupponi could take one of the stages containing many categorized climbs which award mountains classification points, if properly supported by his team Del Tongo–Colnago.\nDuring the presentation of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks for the overall victory. Roberto Visentini garnered the most votes from his fellow riders, but Delgado, Hampsten and LeMond also received many votes. Many media outlets felt that the overall victory would likely go to a non-Italian rider due to the lack of Italian general classification competitors, but that Visentini had the best chance of winning out of competing Italians.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 1988 edition of the Giro d'Italia was revealed to the public on television by head organizer Vincenzo Torriani, on 5 March 1988. It contained four time trial events, three of which were individual and one a team event. The race organizers hoped that the number of time trials, including one on the last day, would keep the race hotly contested to the end. There were fifteen stages containing thirty categorized climbs, of which four had summit finishes: stage 6, to Campitello Matese; stage 12, to Selvino; stage 13, to Chiesa in Valmalenco; and stage 15, to the Merano 2000 mountain. Another stage with a mountain-top finish was stage 18, which consisted of a climbing time trial to Valico del Vetriolo. The organizers chose to not include any rest days. When compared to the previous year's race, the race was shorter, contained one fewer rest day and individual time trial, and lacked a prologue. In addition, this race contained one fewer stage, but one more set of half stages. The race was televised in parts of Europe by Italy's national public broadcasting service, RAI.\nThe eleventh stage between Parma and Colle Don Bosco was cancelled due to protests near the finish line. The fifteenth stage was originally intended to be and to start in Bormio. However, due to very poor weather conditions, the start was moved to Spondigna and the stage was shortened to . The route originally had the riders crossing the Stelvio Pass, but it was skipped due to snowdrifts that had developed on the roads. Excluding the finish on the Merano 2000, the stage was relatively flat after the adjustments.\nIn previous years, the organizers had made the race easier for the Italian favorites by including fewer hard climbs. With the absence of Italian Francesco Moser from this edition, the race organizers included many famous and difficult climbs, such as the Gavia Pass. Moser himself stated that the route contained many difficult climbs and was not helping Italian cycling to prosper at a time when he believed it to be ailing. When asked about the route for the 1988 edition, rider Bob Roll said \"Those sons of bitches put every mountain they could find in the race that year.\" Three-time winner Gino Bartali also believed the route to be very difficult and in favor of non-Italian competitors. Gino Sala also felt the route was harsher than in years past and that the team time trial could influence the overall classification greatly. \"La Stampa\" writer Gian Paolo Ormezzano praised the route saying it was beautiful and well crafted but contained one flaw, in that the race did not finish in any major Italian city. He also expressed his delight with the uphill time trial to Valico del Vetriolo as well as the inclusion of the Stelvio, Rombo and Gavia mountain passes.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a time trial in the city of Urbino, which was won by Jean-François Bernard with a three-second margin over Tony Rominger. Guido Bontempi won the second stage and moved to third overall, while Bernard gained a five-second buffer over the second-placed rider, Rominger. In stage 4a, Massimo Podenzana soloed to victory in Rodi Garganico, five minutes ahead of the second-place finisher. This victory and the respective time bonus allowed Podenzana to gain the \"maglia rosa\", which he held until stage 12. Stage 4b was a team time trial won by Del Tongo–Colnago, eleven seconds ahead of . Podenzana's lead shrunk to a little over two minutes after his team, Atala–Ofmega, finished two minutes and thirty-six seconds behind Del Tongo–Colnago.\nThe eleventh stage was run without problems until the final mile, when environmentalist protestors occupied the finish line and forced the annulment of the stage. The protestors were upset with a nearby factory, owned by chemical manufacturer Montedison, which the protestors claimed had been polluting the Bormida river. The next stage was marked by the appearance of the major mountains and by Pondenzana conceding the \"maglia rosa\" to Franco Chioccioli. The ensuing stages saw the general classification shift more frequently due to the intensity of the mountains and fatigue.\nThe fourteenth stage was memorable for its extreme weather, most notably on the final climb of the Gavia Pass. Overnight, a large amount of snow had accumulated on the Gavia, but the roads were cleared in time for the riders. Despite the cold and adverse weather forecast, the patron, Vincenzo Torriani, decided to go ahead with the stage. As snow fell on the riders climbing the muddy roads of the Gavia, Hampsten attacked at the base of the mountain but was chased by Erik Breukink, who eventually caught up and passed the American with to go. Although Breukink won the stage, Hampsten made the bigger story by becoming the first American to don the \"maglia rosa\" in the history of the Giro d'Italia. Conditions were so bad that one rider, Toshiba–Look's Dominique Gaigne, had to be carried on his bike into a shelter as his hands were frozen gripping the handlebars and former winner Giuseppe Saronni even stopped at a spectator's house and returned with a glass of the Italian liqueur Grappa.\nThe start of the fifteenth stage was moved ahead from Bormio to Spondigna, because of snow covering the Stelvio Pass, but the summit finish in Merano was maintained. As soon as the climb started, Bernard, Urs Zimmermann and Chioccioli attacked. Bernard eventually shook off the two riders and won the stage, but with minimal time gain. The sixteenth stage was marked by rain – which turned into snow as the peloton rose higher – and by two protests while climbing the Rombo Pass. Near the summit of the last climb, Hampsten and a few others formed an escape group that was eventually caught in the final kilometers. The group raced into Innsbruck, where Franco Vona made a last minute attack that won him the stage. Bernard – who was in sixth place overall at the start of the seventeenth stage – crashed in a tunnel but managed to finish the stage; however, the following day he did not start the leg and withdrew from the race.\nThe eighteenth stage, an individual time trial, would prove critical in deciding the overall winner of the Giro. The route started off with of flat roads, before the climb to the finish at the Vetriolo Terme ski station in Valico del Vetriolo. Going into the stage, Hampsten led the race by 42 seconds over Breukink, a margin that was increased by a further 32 seconds after the time trial. The nineteenth stage featured three categorized climbs. Zimmermann attacked on the first, the Duran Pass, but was caught later by Stefano Giuliani who bridged the gap on the descent of the Duran. The two riders rode to the finish together in Arta Terme. Although Giuliani won the stage, Zimmermann moved into second place overall, after gaining over three minutes on the general classification contenders.\nThe twentieth stage came down to a sprint finish, won by Paolo Rosola, who was later disqualified as his teammate, Roberto Pagnin, was found to have pushed him during the sprint. As a result, the second-place finisher, Alessio Di Basco, was awarded the stage victory. The penultimate stage was completely flat and culminated in a bunch sprint, won by Urs Freuler. Hours later, the final stage – a hilly individual time trial – took place. The weather conditions were fine for the majority of the riders, but as the general classification contenders were on the course, it began to lightning and rain heavily. There was a tricky descent about into the stage, which became more dangerous with the rain and ultimately resulted in the crashes of Giupponi and Zimmerman. The time lost by Zimmermann cost him his second place overall. Lech Piasecki, who rode the course when dry, won the stage by a wide margin. Hampsten lost twenty seconds to Breukink, but it did not prevent him from becoming the first American to win the Giro d'Italia. The other podium positions were filled by non-Italian riders for the second year in a row and the third time in the history of the race. Breukink had been part of the non-Italian podium in 1987, behind Ireland's Stephen Roche and Great Britain's Robert Millar.\nStage success was limited to eleven of the competing teams, seven of which achieved multiple victories. Four individual riders won multiple stages: Bernard (stages 1, 8 and 15), Bontempi (stages 2 and 5), Hampsten (stages 12 and 18), and Di Basco (stages 9 and 20). won three stages with Bernard and stage 7 with Andreas Kappes. won two stages, with Breukink in stage 14, and Freuler in stage 21a. won three stages, with a solo breakaway by Rominger in stage 13; Vona in stage 16, and Giuliani in stage 19. Del Tongo–Colnago also won multiple stages, with Chioccioli in stage 6, Piasecki in stage 21b, and the team time trial in stage 4b.\nSelca–Ciclolinea, Ceramiche Ariostea, Gewiss-Bianchi and Atala–Ofmega won one stage apiece. Ceramiche Ariostea rider Stephan Joho took stage 3 in a sprint finish, as did Gewiss-Bianchi rider Rosola in stage 10, and Selca–Ciclolinea 's Patrizio Gambirasio in stage 17. Atala–Ofmega's Podenzana won stage 4a after a solo breakaway.\nDoping.\nThe race organizers performed anti-doping controls throughout the race. Riders would be selected after a stage and have thirty minutes to get tested. The results generally would be returned between thirty and sixty minutes later. No rider tested positive in this edition of the Giro, but had this happened, the following penalties would have been applied: the rider would be demoted to last place of the stage, given a ten-minute penalty in the general classification, a lengthy suspension, and a fine of one thousand francs. Although no riders tested positive, Roberto Visentini, Flavio Giupponi and Urs Zimmermann – who placed second, third and fourth, respectively, in the eighteenth stage – showed up too late for their control tests and were given the penalties corresponding to riders testing positive; after complaints and threats to leave the race from their team leaders, the jury later reverted their decision, and no penalty was given.\nClassification leadership.\nFive different jerseys were worn during the 1988 Giro d'Italia. The leader of the general classification – calculated by adding the stage finish times of each rider, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages – wore a pink jersey. The time bonuses for the 1988 Giro were fifteen seconds for first, ten seconds for second, and five seconds for third place on the stage. This classification is the most important of the race, and its winner is considered as the winner of the Giro.\nFor the points classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for finishing a stage in the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, carried more points than the other first category climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\" for this edition of the Giro was supposed to be the Stelvio Pass, however the day the peloton was supposed to climb it, heavy snow cover forced the organization to omit it from the stage. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided the same way as the general classification, but considering only neo-professional cyclists (in their first three years of professional racing).\nThe combination classification, represented by a blue jersey, was calculated by summing up the points obtained by each rider in the other classifications; the leader was the rider with the lowest total of points.\nAlthough no jersey was awarded, there was also one classification for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time.\nAftermath.\nAfter the race, Andrew Hampsten told \"El Mundo Deportivo\" that he believed this was the biggest win of his career so far and thought he could win the upcoming Tour de France. Hampsten stated that Jean-François Bernard and Pedro Delgado both lacked awareness when attacking in the mountains and did not make the most of the time trials, but believed they would be more active in the Tour de France. In addition, Hampsten thought Bernard and Roberto Visentini did not perform to their expectations. He did not go on to win the Tour de France, but placed fifteenth overall. Runner-up Erik Breukink commented that he was satisfied with his second-place finish, but \"Hampsten was simply better at the decisive moments\". In addition, Breukink stated he came to the race in order to prepare for the Tour de France in July. At the Tour, he finished in twelfth overall and won the young rider classification for being the highest ranked rider in the general classification under the age of 25. Third place finisher Urs Zimmermann reflected on the race and stated that his chance of winning the overall race were gone after the Gavia stage. \"l'Unita\" writer Gino Sala looked back on the race and believed Delgado did not perform well and was not a serious threat to win the race. Luis Gómez, a writer for \"El País\", thought Delgado did not prepare properly for the Giro.\nIn 2012, the organizer of the Giro d'Italia, RCS Sport, did a survey on the greatest moments in the history of the Giro by interviewing over 100 journalists. The 1988 race was mentioned several times as one of the most memorable, with the journalists citing the fourteenth stage that traversed the Gavia Pass as the highlight. Several writers have referred to the fourteenth stage as being \"epic\" or \"iconic\" due to the weather conditions the riders battled over difficult climbs and unpaved roads to finish the stage. According to \"CyclingNews\" writer Jason Sumner, a photo from the fourteenth stage depicting the future winner Andrew Hampsten climbing the Gavia while a snowstorm blows in the foreground has become a widely known image that even casual cycling fans would recognize. After the stage, \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" called the stage \"The Day the Big Men Cried\", with the stage still being commonly referred to as such."

        "text": "The South Canterbury Rugby Football Union (SCRFU) is a rugby province based in the central South Island city of Timaru, New Zealand. The South Canterbury team play at Fraser Park located in Timaru.\nHistory.\nClub rugby in South Canterbury predated the formation of South Canterbury RFU by at least two decades. The first recorded club rugby match in South Canterbury was played on 15 October 1867 between The Timaru and Temuka Clubs at Arowhenua. Eight years later, in 1875, the South Canterbury Football Club was formed, founded by Alfred St. George Hamersley the former captain of the England national rugby union team and resident of Timaru. Soon after on 24 May 1875 a match was played between North and South Canterbury at Ashburton that resulted in a draw. More clubs were formed, such as the Waimate Football Club on 24 May 1876, and Christchurch are recorded as playing Temuka in 1876. On 26 July 1879, a meeting was held in Timaru at the instigation again of Hamersley, at which delegates representing the clubs Christchurch, Christ's College, Temuka, North Canterbury (Rangiora), Eastern (Christchurch), South Canterbury (Timaru), Ashburton, and Southbridge agreed to form the Canterbury Rugby Football Union.\nThe South Canterbury Rugby Football Union (SCRFU) was formed in 1888 when it broke away from the Canterbury Rugby Football Union. A meeting of delegates from football clubs in South Canterbury was held at the office of \"Messrs Hamersley and Wood, Timaru, to consider the advisability of forming a Rugby Football Union in the district.\" Once again, Hamersley was involved in a pivotal point in the history of rugby in the region and his role was commemorated in 2010 with the introduction of the Hamersley trophy, a 186 cm tall silver trophy, for the winners of the senior rugby competition (the Personnel Placements club rugby championship). This meeting was attended by delegates from the South Canterbury, Pirates, Temuka, Waimate, Geraldine, Winchester and Fairlie Creek clubs and as a result of the union the South Canterbury club agreed to change its name to the Timaru Club. Formal association with the Canterbury RFU was broken and it was established that the boundaries of the South Canterbury union were to be the Rangitata and Waitaki rivers, and the headquarters was Timaru. Soon after, a representative match was played on 24 July 1888 against the New Zealand Native Team on the Athletic Grounds, Timaru.\nSouth Canterbury has produced a number of All Blacks and are one of the few unions to have played in all three Divisions of the NPC. South Canterbury has also had some notable victories over touring international sides including the 1961 French team. In 2011 the South Canterbury Heartland team played the 2011 Russian World Cup team who toured New Zealand before the 2011 Rugby World Cup at Fraser Park.

The MCLA oversees game play and conducts national championships for over 200 teams in ten conferences throughout the United States and Canada. The MCLA provides a governing structure much like the NCAA, with eligibility rules, All-Americans and a national tournament to decide national champions in both Divisions I and II.\nThe MCLA exists to provide a quality college lacrosse experience where varsity NCAA lacrosse does not exist. On an individual scale, the MCLA provides rules and a structure that promotes \"virtual varsity\" lacrosse, or an experience paralleling that of NCAA programs. While the MCLA provides a high level of athletic competition, it is one of the few governing bodies that does not have a national GPA requirement for its athletes. On a national scale, the MCLA provides the infrastructure to support a level playing field through eligibility rules and enforcement and the use of NCAA rules of play. The MCLA, an organization governing a mere 70 teams in 1997, has seen a rapid growth in affiliation as national interest in the sport of lacrosse continues to increase. As of the 2014 season, participation has increased to 210 teams.\nHistory.\nThe MCLA was formerly known as the US Lacrosse Men’s Division of Intercollegiate Associates (USL MDIA). The MCLA was created by the MDIA Board of Directors and its creation was announced by US Lacrosse on August 24, 2006.\nMCLA President John Paul was interviewed in a podcast on August 31, 2006. Information obtained from this interview includes:\nMedia coverage.\nThe MCLA receives significant print coverage from US Lacrosse's \"Lacrosse Magazine\" and Inside Lacrosse. Inside Lacrosse acquired the license agreement from The Lax Mag in 2012 and devoted further coverage with weekly web editorial and podcasts. In efforts to promote the sport, the MCLA has also made strides to make lacrosse games available to a larger audience. In partnership with The Lacrosse Network (TLN) select games are available to viewers with streaming live feed. In the 2012 National Championship, 26 games from the tournament were broadcast live, exclusively on the MCLA tournament website while the Division II Finals, Division I Semifinals and Division I Championship were televised nationally on Fox College Sports. Additional coverage is occasionally featured on ESPN, LaxPower.com, various blogs and other news websites.\nMilestones.\nColorado State University holds the record for most MCLA championships won with six (1999, 2001, 2003, 2006, 2012 and 2013). The Rams also hold the distinction of sending the first MCLA player into Major League Lacrosse when goaltender Alex Smith made the roster of Denver Outlaws from 2006-2010. Brigham Young (1997, 2000, 2007, 2011, 2021) is second in MCLA history with five national titles.\nThe University of Michigan Varsity Club Lacrosse Team became the first team in MCLA history to complete a perfect season by defeating Chapman University in the national championship game on May 17, 2008. The Wolverines were able to repeat their success the following season by once again going undefeated and beating Chapman University in the national championship game on May 16, 2009.\nIn 2008, Brekan Kohlitz of the University of Michigan became the first MCLA player drafted to the MLL by the Washington Bayhawks.\nIn 2010, Connor Martin of Chapman University, a two-time All American and Offensive Player of the Year, was drafted by the Denver Outlaws. In his debut for the Outlaws, he scored a hat-trick and recorded an assist, earning him MLL Rookie of the Week. In 2014 Cam Holding became the second player ever to play in the MCLA to get drafted into the MLL by the Chesapeake Bayhawks. He currently plays for the Denver Outlaws and recently won a Gold medal in the 2014 FIL World Lacrosse Championship with team Canada.\nThe 2009-2011 MCLA Championships were held at Dick's Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, Colorado.\nIn 2011, with the conclusion of the agreement between the MCLA and Dick’s Sporting Goods Park, the MCLA selected a new home for the National Championships. The 2012, 2013 MCLA Championships were relocated to a new venue; Sirrine Stadium in Greenville, South Carolina.\nThe 2014, MCLA National Championships were held in Southern California. The opening two rounds were played at UC Irvine in Orange County and the semifinals and finals at Chapman University in Orange, CA. Two first-time champions were crowned, Colorado (DI) and Grand Valley State (DII).\nMCLA Conferences.\nThe MCLA separates teams into divisions (I or II) based upon performance history, and regional conferences. \nNational Championship.\nThe National Championships are held in May, featuring 16 qualifying teams from each division in a single-elimination contest to decide the National Champions. Each of the nine conference champions of the regular season receives an automatic bid to the National Tournament. The remaining seven teams to qualify for the tournament are selected by an at large process by the MCLA tournament committee.\nList of MCLA Statistical Leaders.\nMCLA Division I All Time Career Points Leaders (230 Minimum)\nMCLA Division I All Time Career Goals Leaders (150 Minimum)\nMCLA Division II All Time Career Points Leaders (230 Minimum)\nMCLA Division II All Time Career Goals Leaders (150 Minimum)"

        "text": "Gary Ross Freeman (born 4 December 1962) is a New Zealand former professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1980s and 1990s, and coached in the 2000s, who both captained and coached the New Zealand national team. He was arguably one of New Zealand's greatest Test halfbacks and at the time of his retirement he was the most-capped New Zealand test player and also held the record for most consecutive tests for New Zealand with 37.\nFreeman played his club football in New Zealand for Auckland's Northcote club, in the UK for England's Kent Invicta and Castleford (Heritage No. 628) clubs, and in Australia for Sydney's Balmain (with whom he reached the 1988 and 1989 Grand Finals), Eastern Suburbs (with whom he won the 1992 Dally M Medal), Penrith and Parramatta clubs.\nBiography.\nFreeman was born in Auckland, New Zealand on 4 December 1962. He played rugby league as a Bay Roskill Vikings junior.\nPlaying career.\n1980s.\nIn 1982, Freeman was graded by the Northcote Tigers as a nineteen-year-old in the Auckland Rugby League competition and played there for most of the 1980s, gaining representative selection for the Auckland rugby league team. He also played in England for Kent Invicta at the start of the 1983-84 season. Freeman also spent a season playing for English club Castleford. He was selected to go on the 1986 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia and Papua New Guinea and made his debut for the Kiwis at halfback in the second Test against Australia. He was retained for the third Test against Australia and for both Tests against Papua New Guinea.\nFreeman moved to Australia to play for Sydney club Balmain Tigers in the 1988 NSWRL season. During the mid-season 1988 Great Britain Lions tour, Freeman played from the bench for New Zealand in the sole Test match in Christchurch, scoring two tries that helped the Kiwis to a victory that booked their place in the final of the 1985–1988 Rugby League World Cup. Before that, however, Freeman was selected to play at halfback for the Balmain Tigers in the 1988 NSWRL Grand Final. He played for New Zealand in the halves at the 1988 World Cup final which was lost to Australia.\nFreeman played in all three Tests of the 1989 Kangaroo tour of New Zealand. Later that year, he made it two consecutive Grand Finals when he again played at halfback for Balmain in the 1989 NSWRL season's Premiership decider.\n1990s.\nIn all three Tests of the 1990 Great Britain Lions tour, Freeman was selected to play at halfback for the Kiwis. He was selected to captain New Zealand at halfback for the 1991 Trans-Tasman Test series in Australia. Freeman commenced playing for Eastern Suburbs Roosters for the 1992 NSWRL season. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, Freeman captained New Zealand from halfback in both Test matches, being named man-of-the-match in the first and scoring a try in the second. At the end of the 1992 NSWRL season, Freeman was awarded the Dally M Medal as the competition's player of the year for his performance as Eastern Suburbs' halfback.\nNicknamed \"Whiz\", Freeman was selected to captain the Kiwis from halfback for the 1993 Trans-Tasman Test series against Australia. He then captained the Kiwis from halfback for the 1993 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France. \nFor the 1994 NSWRL season, Freeman transferred to the Penrith Panthers. For the first game of the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series, Freeman was replaced as captain of the New Zealand national team by John Lomax, but regained the position for the remaining two games. At the end of that year, he travelled with the Kiwis to the UK for the 1995 World Cup, playing his 45th and final international at against Papua New Guinea.\nFreeman began the 1996 ARL season as captain of his new club, the Parramatta Eels. Freeman retired from playing at the end of this season, with the Eels' captaincy being transferred to fellow Kiwi Jarrod McCracken.\nPost-playing.\nOn 31 December 1996, Freeman was included in the 1997 New Year Honours, being appointed a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby league. He later became a rugby league commentator. At the end of the 1997 Super League season, Freeman provided commentary for the Grand Final. He did the same for the 1998 Anzac Test.\nCoaching career.\nAt the close of the 2000 World Cup, in which New Zealand lost the tournament final to Australia, Freeman was selected to replace Frank Endacott as Kiwis coach. Under Freeman in 2001, New Zealand played a one-off Test match against France and defeated them 36–0 at Ericsson Stadium. The Kiwis then played Australia at the new Westpac Stadium in Wellington and lost 28–10.\nFreeman was also coach for the 2002 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France, although it was to be his last in charge of the national team. In 2003, Daniel Anderson was named as the new Kiwis coach. Freeman later became coach of the New South Wales \"Young Achievers\" team.\nLater years.\nIn 2007, Freeman was inducted as one of the NZRL's Legends of League. He is also an Auckland Rugby League Immortal. Freeman further worked as the co-host of Fox Sports' NRL coverage and panel member of \"NRL on FOX\" until 2011."

        "text": "The Auckland Rugby League (ARL) is the governing body for the sport of rugby league in the Auckland Region of New Zealand. Founded in 1909, the ARL has played a central role in the development and promotion of rugby league in Auckland, contributing to the sport's rich history in the region.\nHistory.\nUnofficial representative matches were played as early as 1908 leading to the formation of the official organisational body at the Chamber of Commerce on Swanson Street on July 19 in 1909. Dissatisfaction among players with the Auckland Rugby Union led to the formation of rugby league clubs, with the first club, North Shore Albions were the first club to form on July 23 and then Ponsonby United, City Rovers, and Newton Rangers were formed over the following days and weeks. \nThe first organised club match was played on July 25 between North Shore Albions and City Rovers at Eagleton's Paddock in Epsom with North Shore winning 44-24. The first full club season was held in 1910 and featured 4 teams, Newton Rangers, City Rovers, Ponsonby United, and North Shore Albions. \nOver the years, Auckland rugby league has participated in various national competitions, including the Lion Red Cup, which began in 1994. The Auckland region's representation in this competition evolved over the years, with notable successes including North Harbour winning in 1994 and 1995, and Counties-Manukau emerging as champions in 1996.\nIn addition to club competitions, the Auckland Rugby League representative team has a rich history, including victories against international sides such as Australia, England, and France. Notable achievements include defeating these teams within 21 days in 1977 and securing victory against the touring Australian side in 1989.\nThe Auckland Rugby League was once recognised by England's Northern Rugby Football Union as New Zealand's governing body for the game of rugby league.\nIn 2009, the ARL celebrated its centenary. \nClub competitions.\nAuckland's premier competition is the Fox Memorial Shield. This has been contested since 1910.\nDefunct or merged clubs.\nCity Rovers and Newton Rangers merged in the early 1900s. City Newton Dragons later merged with Point Chevalier to become 'City-Pt Chevalier'. Later the two clubs separated, and then in 2004 City Newton folded, while Point Chevalier remained. Ponsonby United and Maritime merged to become Ponsonby-Maritime, they parted ways in 1983 and Ponsonby are still in existence. Navy merged with North Shore to become 'Navy/North Shore' however North Shore ceased to exist in 2009. \nOther teams to cease as their own entities include:\nSenior club trophies.\nFox Memorial.\nThe Fox Memorial is awarded to the grand final winner in the Premiership. In 2022 the 19 competing teams are split into 2 sections. After playing each other the top 6 in each section moved into the Fox Premiership play offs.\nFor a list of the major trophies awarded in Auckland club rugby league go to Auckland Club Rugby League Trophies (this includes player awards as well as team awards).\nPast decade winners:\nRoope Rooster.\nThe Roope Rooster is currently held by the Point Chevalier Pirates who went through the 2022 season undefeated in all home challenges.\nNational competitions.\nLion Red Cup.\nWhen the Lion Red Cup was started in 1994 Auckland was originally represented by four teams. The Auckland City Vulcans, The Waitakere City Raiders, The and the North Harbour Sea Eagles. In 1995 the Vulcans were replaced by the Auckland Warriors Colts. In 1996 Auckland City did not compete.\nBartercard Cup/Premiership.\nPreviously Auckland had a large representation in the Bartercard Cup, in its final seasons before it ceased to run Auckland was represented by the Auckland Lions, Waitakere Rangers, Harbour League, and the Tamaki Titans.\nWith the folding of the Bartercard Cup, Auckland rugby league team was awarded a place in the new six-team Bartercard Premiership, beginning in 2008. In 2009 the competition was mirrored by Under 18 and Under 16 grade competitions. The competition was replaced by the seven-team National Zonal Competition in 2010. Effectively Auckland club rugby league reverted to its regular form, with the zonal competition representing regional representative teams as in the past.\nRepresentative team.\nAuckland has played against several touring teams over the years though once the Auckland Warriors started playing in 1995 it diluted the standard of the side and they have not played against full international sides in recent years.\nAuckland famously beat Australia, England and France in the space of 21 days in 1977. A feat which the New Zealand Warriors commemorated by wearing replica strips in their Round 24 clash with the Manly Sea Eagles on 26 August 2007, when the Warriors won 36–14 in front of a packed Mount Smart Stadium.\nAuckland also beat the touring Australian side in 1989 by 26 points to 24 at Carlaw Park.\nAuckland represented New Zealand for most years in the Australian midweek competition (see Amco Cup) in the 1970s and 1980s. Central Districts, Canterbury, Wellington, and South Island also fielded teams .\nAuckland representative sides traditionally wear a blue jersey with a white double 'V', in the same style of the New Zealand national rugby league team jersey but with blue instead of black, this is still the jersey worn by the Auckland Vulcans NSW Cup team (see below).\nAuckland Warriors.\nAuckland Rugby League originally owned the Auckland Warriors (now known as New Zealand Warriors) when they were entered into the 1995 Winfield Cup, run by the Australian Rugby League. The club is based at Ericsson Stadium. By 1998 the club had yet to experience any success and so was sold to a consortium including the Tainui tribe."

        "text": "The Little League World Series was a baseball tournament held August 17 through August 26 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. Eight teams from the United States and eight from throughout the world competed to decide the winner of the 61st installment of the Little League World Series. On August 26, the U.S. champion from Warner Robins, Georgia, defeated the international champion from Tokyo, Japan, 3–2 in 8 innings on a walk-off home run by Dalton Carriker. This was the second straight year that a team from Georgia won the championship.\nThe series was marked by dramatic finishes. The championship final was the third elimination game in the tournament to end with a walk-off homer. In the international bracket, one of the semifinals ended with the team from Willemstad, Curaçao, defeating the team from Maracaibo, Venezuela, on a three-run, come-from-behind walk-off shot in the 7th inning. The Curaçao team would be the victim of a come-from-behind walk-off grand slam in the international final two days later.\nThe tournament was televised on ESPN, ESPN2, and ABC. Games were held in the two stadiums located at Little League headquarters in South Williamsport:\nGroups.\nBetween five and sixteen teams competed in regional tournaments to progress to the Little League World Series, which varied from straight-knockout competitions (Japan) to the group/elimination format used in the United States. 2007 was the first year that Japan received its own regional playoff, with the Asia (Japan's former home) and Pacific regions merging to create the new Asia-Pacific group.\nResults.\nPool play.\nThe top two teams in each pool move on to their respective semifinals. The winners of each met on August 26 to play for the Little League World Championship. Teams marked in \"green\" qualified to the knockout stage, while the remaining teams were eliminated.\nTies are broken based on records in head-to-head competition among tied teams. In the event of a three-way tie for first place, the tie is broken by calculating the ratio of runs allowed to defensive innings played for all teams involved in the tie. The team with the lowest runs-per-defensive-inning ratio is ranked first and advances. Second place is determined by the head-to-head result of the other two teams. If the three-way tie is for 2nd place, the runs-per-defensive-inning ratio rule is used. The team with the lowest run ratio advances, the other two teams are eliminated.\nUnited States.\nAll times US EDT\nInternational.\nAll times US EDT\nTelevision coverage.\nFor the first time, all 32 games of the tournament, from the opening pitch to the final out, were scheduled for a live telecast in the United States. All but one of the broadcasts were to be on either ESPN, ESPN2 or ABC. (The remaining game, the August 19 Pabao vs. Arabian-American game, was to be shown online on ESPN360, then shown the next day on ESPN2, but the rebroadcast on ESPN2 was canceled and replaced by live coverage of the rain-delayed NASCAR 3M Performance 400, and part of the game was shown live on ESPN due to a rain delay in the scheduled St. Louis Cardinals-Chicago Cubs game). ABC was to have its most comprehensive coverage ever, with games on both weekend days in the preliminary rounds, as well as both semifinals and the championship game for a total of five games. ESPN had 15 games scheduled for broadcast, while ESPN2 had 11. A number of games (yet to be announced) were to be shown in high-definition.\nThe expanded coverage was part of a new eight-year contract between ESPN, Inc. and the Little League organization that started with this series.\nNo international broadcast plans were available, but possible outlets included ESPN International and TSN (Canada).\nAlthough the Western region champion came from the Phoenix media market, its local affiliate, KNXV, did not show Chandler's first round-robin game on August 18. Instead, ESPN interrupted its normal feed on Cox Communications and other local cable providers to air the game live in that area. KNXV was then to show the game on tape delay at 4:30 p.m. local time. Similarly, the game was also not seen on KTRK-TV in Houston, ironically an owned and operated station. Both KTRK and KNXV instead showed the National Football League preseason game between the Houston Texans and the Arizona Cardinals.\nRules change.\n1 \nNoteworthy events.\nNotable sportsmanship.\nThe walk off home run by Dalton Carriker that won Warner Robins the LLWS was followed by the team coming over to embrace and comfort the losing Tokyo team. This event was given considerable press coverage and was considered a breath of fresh air in a summer that saw the spotlight focused on the misdoings of Michael Vick and Barry Bonds.\nMeasles outbreak.\nOne of the players on the runner-up Tokyo Kitasuna team was reported to have contracted measles before coming to Williamsport. The player, whose identity was not made public, contracted the virus from a sibling back in Japan in late July and was infectious while traveling. As a result, six people across three states were infected. The boy directly infected four people: a friend from Japan, an airport officer in Detroit, a woman who sat near the boy on the flight from Detroit to Baltimore, and a sales representative in Pennsylvania. The man subsequently infected two Houston-area college students.\nCoon Rapids handshake incident.\nTwo players on the Coon Rapids, Minnesota club reportedly spit on their hands following their elimination from the tournament during pool play. Upon hearing of the incident, which took place as they got ready to shake hands with the victorious Chandler, Arizona, club and was televised throughout the US on ESPN, manager Mark Lowe apologized for the incident.\nNotable players.\nCody Bellinger, a member of the 2007 Chandler North Little League team, became the first player from the 2007 LLWS to play in Major League Baseball, when he was called up by the Los Angeles Dodgers in April 2017.

        "text": "The Rugby Africa Cup is a two-year men's rugby union tournament involving the top 16 African nations based on their World Rugby rankings, it is organised by Rugby Africa. The tournament was first held in 2000. It was renamed the Rugby Africa Cup in November 2019, it was previously called the Africa Cup since 2006, the CAR Top 9 and CAR Top 10.\nDue to South Africa being far stronger than any other African nation, South African teams have only competed five times, and won the competition three times. The winning South African teams on these occasions were the under 23 or amateur players (in 2000, 2001 and 2006).\nHistory.\nThe African Cup of Rugby Union took place for the first time in 2000, with five teams taking part in the event, Morocco, Tunisia, Namibia, Zimbabwe and the hosts South Africa, the winner of the competition.\nIn 2004, a second division called CAR Development Trophy and now named now African Development Trophy was formed, reserved for U19 national teams.\nIn 2006, the Africa Cup was coupled with the Rugby World Cup qualification, the winner qualified for the Rugby World Cup. In 2011, a Division 1A was created and in 2014, the division took place as a four-team championship.\nThe winner of the 2022 Africa Gold Cup will qualify for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and the runner-up will qualify for its final qualification tournament in November 2022.\nStructure.\nThe tournament was revamped in November 2019, this time the top 16 nations, based on their World Rugby rankings prior to the competition, will compete over a two-year period. According to their website Rugby Africa explained the tournament as follows:\nThe first stage consists of a qualifying round: the teams ranked 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th will oppose the teams ranked 13th, 14th, 15th and 16th, respectively, in a single match at home. The winner of each of these four matches will progress to the group phase. In this second stage, the 12 teams are divided into 4 pools; inside each pool the 3 teams play against each other in a home or away game. The winner of each group will progress to the final tournament of the RAC. The top four teams from Africa will meet in one venue for the final stage of the RAC, which will include two semi-finals, a play-off for third place and, ultimately, the final to decide who will be the African champions.\nThe 2019–20 Rugby Africa Cup was the first tournament after the restructuring, but was cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021–22 Rugby Africa Cup will double as a 2023 Rugby World Cup qualifier for Africa.\nIn addition to the main fifteens tournaments, an Under-20 competition featuring eight teams was held in April and a rugby sevens tournament involving twelve teams was held in November. A women's rugby sevens tournament is also to be scheduled.\nSummary.\nBelow is a list of previous tournaments and final results:\nOverall.\nThe overall record of the teams are as follows:\nRugby Africa Gold Cup perpetual trophy.\nThe Rugby Africa Gold Cup is the perpetual trophy awarded to the winner of the Africa Cup (Africa Gold Cup), an annual rugby union tournament involving Africa's top six national 15-man teams (excluding South Africa), organised by World Rugby's African association, Rugby Africa, since 2000.\nThe Rugby Africa Gold Cup perpetual trophy – a Rugby World Cup qualifier – has been officially unveiled during the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Congress in Brussels on May 8, 2018, in the presence of Abdelaziz Bougja, President of Rugby Africa, Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard, Founder of APO Group and main official partner of Rugby Africa, Gianni Merlo, President of the , and Mitchell Obi, President of AIPS Africa.\nIt has been presented to the winner of the Rugby Africa Gold Cup for the first time in August 2018.\nPrior to this date, each winner of the Rugby Africa Gold Cup received a trophy.\nThe back of the trophy is engraved with the text \"Presented by Nicolas Pompigne-Mognard, Founder of APO Group; Abdelaziz Bougja, President of Rugby Africa\".\nHandmade by Swatkins, Great Britain's leading Trophy, Award and Silverware manufacturer since 1898, the Rugby Africa Gold Cup is a Gold Plated Perpetual Trophy Cup. Standing at a height of and weighing , it features a smooth Georgian-bodied design, complete with patterned handles, a stepped lid that is supplied complete with a circular solid African mahogany base. The Trophy has been engraved with the text 'Rugby Africa Gold Cup' and has the shape of Africa in pride of place on the main body. To complete, on the gold plated plinth band this holds the names of the winners. It's estimated there is enough space for at least 70 winning teams' names to be engraved on the base of the perpetual trophy, which would allow it to be used until at least the year 2080."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have thrown an immaculate inning",
        "text": "An immaculate inning occurs in baseball when a pitcher strikes out all three batters he faces in one inning using the minimum possible number of pitches: nine. This has happened 114 times in Major League history and has been accomplished by 104 pitchers (79 right-handed and 25 left-handed). \nMajor League Baseball's first immaculate inning was accomplished by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters against the Philadelphia Quakers on June 4, 1889; and the most recent by Johan Oviedo of the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 24, 2023. Use of the term \"immaculate inning\" first appeared in newspaper reporting after 2000.\nSix pitchers have accomplished the feat more than once, including Hall-of-Famers Lefty Grove, Sandy Koufax, and Nolan Ryan, and active pitchers Chris Sale, Max Scherzer, and Kevin Gausman. Koufax, Sale, and Scherzer are the only pitchers to achieve an immaculate inning three times. Koufax accomplished his first immaculate inning while throwing his first no-hitter, becoming the only player to do both in a single game.\nFive pitchers – Bob Gibson, Randy Johnson, Pedro Martínez, Ryan, and Scherzer – are also members of the 3,000-strikeout club. Sloppy Thurston, Ryan, Wade Miley, Thomas Pannone, Reid Detmers, and Hayden Wesneski are the only rookies to have achieved the feat. Ryan and Gausman have struck out three batters on nine pitches in both the American League and National League.\nDanny Jackson is the sole player to pitch an immaculate inning in the World Series: the seventh inning of Game 5 of the 1985 World Series; it is also the only immaculate inning thrown in a postseason game. Jackson pitched a complete game, winning 6–1 and staving off elimination for the Kansas City Royals, who eventually won the series in seven games.\nWhile an immaculate inning typically occurs with the bases empty, a nine-pitch, three-strikeout performance can also be accomplished by a relief pitcher who enters the game with one or more runners on base. On May 8, 2014, Brad Boxberger of the Tampa Bay Rays entered a game against the Baltimore Orioles with the bases loaded and proceeded to strike out the side with nine pitches. No player has ever struck out four batters on 12 pitches in an inning, with one of those batters reaching base on an uncaught third strike.\nNo pitcher has thrown more than one immaculate inning in a game. Jesús Sánchez of the Florida Marlins came within one pitch of that feat on September 13, 1998. Facing the Atlanta Braves, Sánchez struck out the side in the bottom of the second inning on 10 pitches and threw an immaculate inning in the bottom of the third inning: six consecutive strikeouts on 19 pitches. Just one game has seen two pitchers throw immaculate innings: on June 15, 2022, Phil Maton and Luis Garcia of the Houston Astros struck out the same three Texas Rangers batters in the second and seventh innings respectively.\nFrequency by decade.\nThe frequency of immaculate innings has varied widely throughout baseball history. There were only 30 immaculate innings in the 114 Major League seasons from 1876 to 1988, but the next 30 occurred in the 21 seasons from 1989 to 2009. The pace has since picked up even more, with 43 immaculate innings in the 12 seasons from 2010 to 2021.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "title": "1931 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1931 Tour de France was the 25th edition of the Tour de France, which took place from 30 June to 26 July. It consisted of 24 stages over .\nThe race was won by French cyclist Antonin Magne. The sprinters Charles Pélissier and Rafaele di Paco both won five stages.\nThe cyclists were separated into national teams and \"touriste-routiers\", who were grouped into regional teams. In some stages (2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12), the national teams started 10 minutes before the touriste-routiers.\nOne of these \"touriste-routiers\" was Max Bulla. In the second stage, when the \"touriste-routiers\" started 10 minutes later than the national teams, Bulla overtook the national teams, won the stage and took the lead, the only time in history that a \"touriste-routier\" was leading the Tour de France.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn 1931, the touriste-routiers started 10 minutes later than the national teams in some stages (2, 3, 4, 6, and 12).\nThe number of rest days in the Tour de France was reduced to three.\nThe time bonus for the winner, which had been used before in the 1924 Tour de France, was reintroduced.\nTeams.\nFor the second year, the race was run in the national team format, with six different teams. Belgium, Italy, Germany and France each sent a team with eight cyclists. Australia and Switzerland sent a combined team, each with four cyclists. The last team was the Spanish team, with only one cyclist. In addition, 40 cyclists joined as \"touriste-routiers\".\nThe French team was favourite, because they had dominated the 1930 Tour. The most competition was expected from the Belgian team, followed by the Italian team.\nRace overview.\nIn the early flat stages, the sprinters dominated. In the second stage, Austrian Max Bulla won the stage. He was a \"touriste-routier\", and had started ten minutes later than the A-class cyclists. He became the first, and only, touriste-routier to lead the Tour de France, and as of 2011 is the only Austrian to have led the race. Max Bulla was the only Austrian cyclist to win a stage in the Tour de France until 2005, when Georg Totschnig won the 14th stage.\nAfter the fifth stage, Charles Pélissier and Rafaele di Paco shared the lead, thanks to the time bonus.\nAfter the seventh stage, the race was still completely open: the first 30 cyclists in the general classification were within 10 minutes of each other.\nThe defending champion, André Leducq, was not in good shape. His teammate Antonin Magne took over the leading role in the French team. In the first mountain stage, Belgian Jef Demuysere was away, with Antonin Magne trying to get him back. After a while, Jef Demuysere flatted, and at that moment Magne passed him. Magne had not seen Demuysere, and still thought he was chasing him. He kept racing as fast as he could, and finished four minutes ahead of Antonio Pesenti. In the next stage, a large group finished together, and Magne was still leading the race with Pesenti as his closest competitor.\nIn the fourteenth stage, Pesenti was away with two teammates. The French team tried to get them back, but didn't succeed. In the end, Magne chased them by himself, but he could not get back to the Italians. His lead decreased to five minutes.\nIn the fifteenth stage, the Italians tried it again, but they were reeled back in by Charles Pélissier. Then Jef Demuysere got away, and won the stage with a margin of two minutes on Magne.\nBefore the penultimate stage, Magne was still leading the race, closely followed by Pesenti. Magne was not sure if he would win the race, because that stage would be over cobbles, on which the Belgian cyclists were considered experts. The night before the stage, Magne could not sleep, and his roommate Leducq suggested that he could read some fan mail. Magne considered reading fan mail before the race was over as giving bad luck, but one oversized letter made him curious. Magne opened it, and read a letter from a fan who claimed that Belgian cyclist Gaston Rebry (who had won the 1931 Paris–Roubaix race over the same cobbles) had written to his mother that he was planning to attack on the penultimate stage, together with Jef Demuysere. Leducq thought the letter was a joke, but Magne did not take the risk and told his teammates to stay close to Rebry and Demuysere.\nAfter 60 km, Rebry and Demuysere took off, and Magne followed them. The Belgians took turns to attack Magne, but they could not get away from him. They finished more than seventeen minutes ahead of Pesenti, which secured the victory for Magne and had Demuysere overtake Pesenti for the second place.\nResults.\nIn stages 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 and 12, the national teams started 10 minutes before the touriste-routiers; in all other stages all cyclists started together. The cyclist to reach the finish in the least time was the winner of the stage.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added together. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per team; the team with the least time was the winner.\nStage winners.\nFive stages were won by touriste-routiers: Stages 2, 4, 7, 12 and 17, the highest number of stages ever won by touriste-routiers.\nOther classifications.\nThe organisers, from the newspaper l'Auto, named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Jef Demuysere.\nAftermath.\nAfter the Tour de France was over, the winner Antonin Magne was so tired that he had to rest for several weeks."

It consisted of 21 stages over .\nAndré Leducq, who also won six stages, won the race, thanks to the bonification system; had the bonification system not existed, the margin between Leducq and Kurt Stöpel would only have been three seconds.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn the 1931 Tour de France, there had been a time bonification system, which gave 3 minutes of bonification to the winner of the stage, if he finished more than three minutes ahead of the second cyclist in that stage. In 1932, this bonification system changed: now the winner of the stage received 4 minutes, the second-placed cyclist 2 minutes and the third-placed cyclist 1 minute, plus an extra three minutes if the margin was more than three minutes. The bonification system was invented to give sprinters, who lost a lot of time in the mountains, a chance to battle for the general classification.\nThe number of stages decreased from 24 to 21. The total distance also decreased, so the average length per stage remained about the same, 215 km (compared to 160–170 km in modern Tours).\nTeams.\nFor the third year, the race was run in the national team format, with five different teams. Belgium, Italy, Switzerland and France each sent a team with eight cyclists, while Germany and Austria sent a combined team, with seven German cyclists and one Austrian cyclist. In addition, 40 cyclists joined as \"touriste-routiers\".\nCharles Pélissier, who had won 13 stages in the 1930 and 1931 Tours, and Antonin Magne, the winner of 1931, were absent from the French team. Still, there were so many good French cyclists in that time that the French team was still considered superior.\nThe Italian team included three Giro d'Italia winners: the winner from the 1930 Giro d'Italia, Luigi Marchisio; the winner from the 1931 Giro d'Italia, Francesco Camusso and the winner from the 1932 Giro d'Italia, Antonio Pesenti.\nThe Belgium team had Jef Demuysere, who had fought for the victory in the previous Tour until the end and had come second, and two-time world champion Georges Ronsse.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, the Belgians had a good start. Jean Aerts won the stage, with Jef Demuysere in second place. In the second stage, there were struggles in the Belgian team between the Dutch-speaking and the French-speaking cyclists. Aerst, Dutch-speaking, did not get the support from his French-speaking teammates, and lost ten minutes in that stage, together with the Italian favourites. German Kurt Stöpel won the stage, and donned the yellow jersey, thanks to the bonification. Stöpel was the first German cyclist to lead the general classification in the Tour de France. In the third stage, the longest stage of this Tour with 387 km, Stöpel lost the lead to André Leducq.\nLeducq kept the lead for the rest of the race, winning six stages along the way.\nIn the fifth stage, Spanish Vicente Trueba escaped and reached the top of the Col d'Aubisque first. On the way down, Benoît Fauré overtook him, and reached the Tourmalet first. But he didn't win the stage, as Italian Antonio Pesenti caught him. Behind the leaders in the stage, Leducq was fighting for the leading position in the general classification. He was not a good climber, but was one of the best descenders.\nOn one stage, Leducq flatted, and received a wheel from his teammate Georges Speicher, who would win the next Tour.\nIn the tenth stage, Leducq almost lost the lead. Camusso had escaped, and Stöpel had followed him. Leducq lost more than five minutes in the stage, and even more due to the bonification time. After that stage, Stöpel was within three minutes of Leducq, and Camusso within six minutes.\nIn the eleventh stage, Leducq could have lost the race. Benoît Fauré, a French cyclist riding as a touriste-routier, escaped, and was followed by Francesco Camusso. At one point, they were so far ahead that Camusso was the virtual leader, but eventually they were caught back.\nLeducq also crossed the finishline first in the eighteenth stage, but the jury relegated him because he had been pushed by Albert Barthélemy.\nLeducq and Stöpel finished in the same group for most of the stages. Only in four stages was there a time difference:\nWithout the bonification system, the time difference between Leducq and Stöpel was three seconds. Leducq received 31 bonification minutes (six first places, two second places and three third place), while Stöpel received only 7 bonification minutes (one first place and three third places).\nResults.\nThe cyclist to reach the finish in the least time was the winner of the stage. The time that each cyclist required to finish the stage was recorded. For the general classification, these times were added together. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe team classification was calculated by adding up the times in the general classification of the three highest ranking cyclists per team; the team with the least time was the winner.\nGeneral classification.\nKurt Stöpel was the first German to reach the podium of the Tour de France. He would be the only German on the podium until Jan Ullrich became 2nd in 1996.\nOther classifications.\nThe organising newspaper, l'Auto named a \"meilleur grimpeur\" (best climber), an unofficial precursor to the modern King of the Mountains competition. This award was won by Vicente Trueba.\nAftermath.\nWinner André Leducq kept riding the Tour de France until 1938, but he never managed to win again, although he had three more stage victories."

        "text": "The 1933 Tour de France was the 27th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 27 June to 23 July. It consisted of 23 stages over .\nThis race featured the introduction of the mountains competition, in which cyclists were challenged to climb the mountains the fastest, with points given to the fastest ascenders. This competition was won by Spaniard Vicente Trueba, who reached 9 of the 16 mountain peaks first.\nThe time bonus of two minutes had a large influence on the outcome of the race. Thanks to this bonus, Georges Speicher won the race; without the bonus, Italian Giuseppe Martano would have been the winner.\nInnovations and changes.\nIn the 1932 Tour de France, the bonus system had had a major impact on the results: without these bonuses, the difference between the number one and number two would have been only three seconds, but with these bonuses, it became more than 24 minutes.\nIn 1933, the bonus time was reduced: only the winner received two minutes of bonus time.\nSince the 1913 Tour de France, the Tour de France had been counter-clockwise. In 1933, this changed, and the race was run clockwise again.\nTeams.\nBelgium, Italy, Switzerland, Germany and France entered national teams, consisting of eight cyclists. Additionally, 40 \"touriste-routiers\", cyclists without a team, entered the race.\nPre-race favourites.\nThe French team has been named the best collection of pre-war cyclists. The Belgian team had talented riders, but were split between French-speaking and Dutch-speaking cyclists.\nThe Italian team was headed by Learco Guerra. Guerra had won three stages in the 1933 Giro d'Italia and had been world champion. Tour director Henri Desgrange had named Guerra as probable winner of the race.\nRace overview.\nOn 27 June 1933, the Tour de France was started by Josephine Baker.\nThe French team, that had won the last three Tours de France, started well. Maurice Archambaud won the first stage, and lead the general classification until the Alps.\nIn the third stage, French sprinter Charles Pélissier, who had already won 13 Tour stages in his career, hit a car. He continued the race, but was injured, and finished behind the time limit.\nUntil the eighth stage, the battle for the lead was between Archambaud and Learco Guerra. In that eighth stage, French cyclist Georges Speicher asked permission to his team leader Archambaud if he could go for the stage win, and he could. He raced away, and won the stage.\nIn the mountains of the ninth stage, Archambaud could not compete with the rest. When Archambaud folded on the Allos, somebody else could take over the lead. The next cyclist in the General Classification, Guerra, had a flat tire, and could not win enough time. In the end, it was unknown Belgian Georges Lemaire who took over the lead. Guerra was only 23 seconds behind in the General Classification after that stage.\nIn stage 10, all but six cyclists finished more than 22 minutes after the winner. According to the rules, the cut-off time (the extra time that a cyclist can lose on the stage winner before he is taken out of the race) was 8% of the time of the stage winner. That rule would have put everybody but these six cyclists out of the race. Because of this, the Tour director Henri Desgrange extended the cut-off time for this stage to 10%, in this way 43 cyclists stayed in the race.\nIn the eleventh stage, the cut-off time was 10%. This would take four cyclists out of the race, but for them the cut-off time was increased to 15%. One of these cyclists had been hit by a car from the Tour direction. Maurice Archambaud took back the lead after that stage thanks to the bonus time, but not for long, as he lost time in the next stage.\nGeorges Speicher led the race from stage 12 on. In the mountains, Speicher struggled. He was dropped many times on the climbs, but was a good descender and got back to the lead group every time. Lemaire initially stayed close to Speicher, and was only 15 seconds behind in the general classification. l'Equipe wrote that with the help of his Belgian team, Lemaire could have challenged Speicher for the overall victory, especially thanks to the help of Jean Aerts. But the Belgian team was still divided between the Dutch-speaking and French-speaking cyclists, and Jean Aerts did not help Lemaire but went for his own success.\nIn the 21st stage, the initial winner Le Grèves together with the initial second-placed cyclist Louyet were punished by the jury, because of irregular sprinting. They were set back to the 6th and 7th place, and Jean Aerts, who initially was third, was named the winner of the race.\nIn the 22nd stage, the winner of the race was determined by one lap in the velodrome. This had not been planned, but was done because when the first group with 28 cyclists reached the velodrome, the gates were still closed.\nBefore the last stage, Martano was in second place, and Guerra in third. This last stage was won by Guerra, and thanks to the bonus time of two minutes, Guerra took over the second place.\nResults.\nGeneral classification.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe bonus in the 1933 Tour de France were also decisive for the overall victory. Without the bonus of two minutes for the stage winner, Giuseppe Martano would have won the race. Speicher received six minutes for his three-stage victories and Guerra ten minutes for five victories, whereas Martano had received no bonus time.\nTeam classification.\nFor the fourth time, there was an official team competition, this time won by the French team.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1933 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner.\nAll five teams finished with at least three cyclists, so all five teams were ranked in the final team classification.\nMountains classification.\nThe mountains classification in the Tour de France was calculated for the first time in 1933. There were 16 mountains in de route of the 1933 Tour de France, and for the first cyclists to reach the top of the mountain, points were given. The first on the top got 10 points, the second 9 points, and so on, until the tenth cyclist who received 1 point. In 1933, it was sponsored by Martini &amp; Rossi.\nAftermath.\nFor the 1933 UCI Road World Championships, that was held after the race, Tour de France winner Georges Speicher was initially not selected. Only after a French cyclist that had been selected dropped out, Speicher was brought in as a replacement at the last notice, and won the race. Speicher was the first cyclist to win the Tour de France and the World Championship in the same year.\nThe national team format that had been introduced in 1930, had in four races produced four French victories. The French audience was therefore greatly interested in the race, and the organising newspaper l'Auto had a record circulation of 854000."

Uganda and Tanzania were joined by Malawi and Zambia, and the cricket team made its ICC Trophy debut in 1990. They played in the following three ICC Trophies, although for the 2001 tournament, they represented Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia only, Uganda having become an associate member of the ICC in their own right in 1998. Tanzania also became an associate member in their own right shortly after the 2001 ICC Trophy, and the team was finally dissolved in 2003, at which point Zambia became an associate member, and Malawi an affiliate member.\nRelated teams.\nAn East and Central Africa under-19 team contested two international tournaments, before the ECACC was broken up into its constituent teams. The first was the 1994 International Youth Cricket Tournament in Malaysia, which also featured Bangladesh, Denmark, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and Sri Lanka. The second was the 2001 Africa Under-19 Championship in Uganda, which was the inaugural edition of the ICC Africa Under-19 Championships. In their first match of the tournament, against Uganda, the ECACC team won by four wickets. They went on to defeat Kenya by three wickets, lose to Namibia by five wickets, and finally defeat West Africa by five wickets, thus placing second overall behind Namibia."

They reached their greatest fame in the mid-late 1970s with such songs as \"Slash\", \"(Your Love Is Like) Nuclear Waste\" and their biggest single, \"All for the Love of Rock and Roll\", which was originally recorded by Ram Jam. The band appeared at popular New York City clubs like Max's Kansas City and CBGB and featured Robert Gordon (vocals), Jeff Salen (guitar), Bobby Butani (guitar), John DeSalvo (bass), and Jim Morrison (drums). This was the original band that was on the \"Live at CBGB's\" compilation record in 1976. After parting ways with Gordon, John Morelli (an Ian Hunter protégé'), replaced Jim Morrison on drums and the band eventually found new lead singer Tommy Frenzy (Frenesi). In 1978, the group released their debut album \"Tuff Darts!\", on Sire Records, produced by Bob Clearmountain and Tony Bongiovi, shortly before disbanding.\nTuff Darts reunited in 2002 to play a gig upon the release of \"Tuff Darts!\" on compact disc. They subsequently played several additional shows and recorded one more album, 2007's \"You Can't Keep A Good Band Down\". It was only released in Japan.\nIn 2009, Spectra Records released two albums worldwide, \"Here Comes Trouble\" and \"You Can't Keep a Good Band Down\". \"Tuff Darts!\", \"You Can't Keep a Good Band Down\" and \"Here Comes Trouble\" are now available as downloads.\nJeff Salen, founder and lead guitarist of the band, died of a heart attack on January 26, 2008, at age 55.\nTuff Darts have been performing since 2011 with a reformed lineup in and around New York City."

He later played for and coached the Indianapolis Capitals of the AHL, and retired in 1945. With the Red Wings he won the Stanley Cup twice, in 1936 and 1937.\nPersonal life.\nSorrell was born in Chesterville, Ontario on 16 January 1906 to John Sorrell (1880-1931) and Mary Lafleur (1881-1925). On 3 May 1928, John married his first wife, Florence Margaret Einberger, daughter of Martin Einberger and Mary Rappel, in Dundas County, Ontario, Canada. Florence died in 1943. On 8 September 1945, John married his second wife Gladys Maxine Galloway, daughter of Robert J. Galloway and Mellie V. Peacock, in Steuben County, Indiana.\nSorrell died on 30 November 1984 at his home in Indianapolis, Indiana. His cause of death was a heart attack due to lung cancer.\nPlaying career.\nSorrell played junior hockey for three different teams in three different leagues. In 1926 he was a young left winger for the Chesterville Colts of the Ontario Hockey Association and showed great promise. He was quickly noticed and in 1927 played forty games for the Quebec Beavers of the CAHL before being called up into the Canadian Professional Hockey League the following year for the Windsor Bulldogs. He was finally noticed by the NHL when the Montreal Canadiens signed him. He never played a game for Montreal, but was instead traded to the London Tecumsehs of the IHL on November 5, 1929. Sorrell continued to show promise and helped the Tecumsehs to a third-place finish in the IHL.\nOn November 10, 1930 he was traded to the Detroit Falcons, and finally found a place to call home for more than a single season. He would spend the next nine years with the Detroit club helping the team to win consecutive Stanley Cups in 1936 and 1937.\nOn February 13, 1938, Sorrell was traded for Hap Emms to the New York Americans where he would spend the rest of his NHL career. He retired from the league in the 1940–41 season, spending his remaining playing days in the AHL with both the Hershey Bears and Indianapolis Capitals, turning to coaching in the 1945–46 season."

        "text": "Volleyball is one of the sports that is played at the Summer Olympic Games in two disciplines: the traditional six-per-side indoor game, and the newer game of beach volleyball. Indoor volleyball was added to the Olympic programme in 1957 at the 53rd session of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in Sofia, Bulgaria, and the first competitions were held at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The Soviet Union won a medal in both the men's and women's competition at the first five Olympics that included volleyball, including the men's gold medal in Tokyo. The Japanese women's team won the gold at the inaugural Olympic volleyball competition, and the silver at the following two Games. The Montreal Games of 1976 saw the Polish men win the nation's only gold medal in the sport, after the women had won bronze in 1964 and 1968. At the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the hosts won gold in both competitions. The Bulgarian team won their only two volleyball medals in Moscow, a silver and a bronze in the men's and women's tournament, respectively. The United States won its first medals in volleyball at the Los Angeles Games: a gold in the men's competition, and a silver in the women's. The People's Republic of China won the gold medal in the women's competition in Los Angeles, their first time participating in an Olympic volleyball competition. The United States successfully defended their men's gold medal at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, and Peru won their only medal in volleyball, a silver in the women's competition. The Soviet Union won a silver medal in the men's competition and a gold in the women's at what would be their final Olympics. Following the 1990–91 breakup of the Soviet Union, 12 of the 15 newly independent countries competed together as the Unified Team in Barcelona. In the women's competition, the Unified Team won the silver medal, and Cuba won their first of three consecutive gold medals. In the men's competition, Brazil won its first gold medal, and the Netherlands its first overall medal in the sport.\nOn 18 September 1993, at the 101st IOC session in Monte Carlo, the Committee voted to add beach volleyball for both men and women to the Olympic programme effective with the 1996 Atlanta Games. A National Olympic Committee is permitted to enter two teams in the beach volleyball tournament; a rule that allowed the United States and Brazil to win both gold and silver in men's and women's beach volleyball respectively that year. Atlanta also saw the Dutch men's indoor team improve their Barcelona silver to a gold. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, the host Australian team won the gold medal in the women's beach volleyball competition, and the Russian Federation took home its first volleyball medals as an independent country with silver in both indoor competitions. At the 2004 Athens Olympics, Spain won its only medal in volleyball, a silver in the men's beach volleyball competition. In women's beach volleyball, the United States team of Misty May (now May-Treanor) and Kerri Walsh (now Walsh Jennings) won the first of three consecutive gold medals, the only team to defend a beach volleyball gold medal. At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the United States men's indoor team won all their matches on the way to their third gold medal win. This equalled the former Soviet Union's record for the most men's championships. The Soviets won twelve medals in the indoor competition, and Brazilian teams have won thirteen medals in beach competition; respectively the most in each discipline. The Brazilian teams, however, with ten indoor medals lead all nations with a total of twenty medals in volleyball events at the Olympics.\nSix athletes have each won four medals in volleyball. Cuban Ana Fernández and American Kerri Walsh Jennings each have three gold and one bronze, Soviet Inna Ryskal and Brazilian Sérgio Santos have two gold and two silver medals, Russian Sergey Tetyukhin has one gold, one silver, and two bronzes, and Italian Samuele Papi has two silvers and two bronzes. Ten athletes have won three gold medals. Seven, including Fernández, were members of the Cuban women's indoor team that won consecutive golds in 1992, 1996 and 2000. May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, as noted above, won beach volleyball gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. The other is Karch Kiraly, who won gold with the United States men's indoor team in 1984 and 1988 and in beach volleyball in 1996. Kiraly is the only player of either gender to win medals in both indoor and beach volleyball. Kiraly is also one of four people that have won medals both as a player and coach. Apart from May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings of the United States, Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego of Brazil are the only athletes with three medals in beach volleyball. They have one gold and one bronze as a team, and each has one silver with other partners.\nStatistics.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes who have won three or more medals are listed below.\nMedals as coach and player (indoor only).\nOnly four volleyball players won medals and then coached indoor teams to the podium. Aside from Lang Ping, who led the United States' women to the silver in 2008, all were managers of their own country's team."

        "title": "List of Olympic medalists in equestrian",
        "text": "Equestrian sports are among those contested at the Summer Olympic Games. Equine events began at the Olympics in 1900, when competitions in polo (considered by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to be a separate sport from the other equestrian events), vaulting, four-in-hand driving, mail coach driving, mixed hacks and hunters and three types of jumping (high jump, long jump and show-jumping) were held. Most of these events were later discontinued, although equestrian events have continued through the 2016 Summer Olympics, and now include team and individual dressage, three-day eventing and show-jumping. Competitors in the modern pentathlon event also have to complete an equestrian show-jumping course, but this is not part of the equestrian events.\nModern-day Olympic equestrian events are rooted in cavalry skills and classical horsemanship, and through 1948, competition was restricted to active-duty officers on military horses. Only after 1952, as mechanization of warfare reduced the number of military riders, were civilian riders allowed to compete. Equestrian is the only Olympic sport in which animals compete with humans, and is one of four sports in which the genders compete against each other, the others being some sailing divisions, mixed doubles division in tennis and the mixed doubles division of badminton. The rules for Olympic equestrian competition are set by the Fédération Équestre Internationale, the international governing body for equestrian sports.\nIn two instances, the equestrian portion of the Olympics has been held in a different location from the rest of the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and having to go through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.\nThe Summer Olympics have included 2,129 equestrian participants, including 1,751 men and 378 women, from 69 countries., of which 564 won a medal. As of the 2008 Olympics, 395 medals have been awarded to 31 NOCs. The oldest rider was 72-year-old Arthur von Pongracz of Austria at the 1936 Summer Olympics, while the youngest was 16-year-old Luiza Almeida of Brazil at the 2008 Summer Olympics. The leading medalist is Isabell Werth of Germany (10, 6 gold), followed by Anky van Grunsven of the Netherlands (9, 3 gold) and Reiner Klimke of Germany (8, 6 gold). Germany leads the country medalist rankings with 25 gold medals (52 overall), followed by Sweden with 17 (43 overall) and France with 14 (37 overall).

        "title": "List of Olympic medalists in skeleton",
        "text": "Skeleton is one of the Olympic sport disciplines contested at the Winter Olympic Games. It was introduced at the 1928 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz – the birthplace of skeleton – in the form of a men's event contested over four runs. Dropped from the 1932 and 1936 Winter Olympics program, skeleton returned in 1948, when St. Moritz hosted again the Winter Olympics, but was discarded from the following Games in Oslo. After 54 years of absence from the Olympic program, skeleton was reinstated as an official medal sport at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, featuring individual events for men and women.\nIn 1928, the first Olympic skeleton event was won by American sledder Jennison Heaton, who also won a silver medal in the bobsleigh's five-man event. His younger brother, John Heaton, was runner-up, spending an additional second to complete all three runs (the fourth was cancelled). He repeated this result 20 years later, placing behind Nino Bibbia of Italy, who won his country's first Winter Olympic gold medal.\nIn 2002, American sledder Jimmy Shea – grandson of Jack Shea, two-time Olympic speed skating champion at the 1932 Lake Placid Games – secured the gold medal by 0.05 seconds, becoming the first Olympic skeleton champion in 54 years. On the same day, another American, Tristan Gale, won the first-ever women's event in the discipline. In the 2006 Winter Olympics men's event, 39-year-old Canadian Duff Gibson beat countryman and world champion Jeff Pain to become the oldest individual gold medalist at the Winter Games. Switzerland's Gregor Stähli won the bronze medal for the second time, beating the third Canadian sledder, Paul Boehm, by 0.26 seconds and thus preventing a medal sweep for Canada. Four years later, Jon Montgomery secured a back-to-back victory for Canada in the men's event, while Amy Williams's win in the women's event gave Great Britain its only medal at the 2010 Winter Olympics, as well as its first individual gold medalist since 1980, and first individual female gold medalist since 1952. This victory was emulated four years later in Sochi by another British athlete, Lizzy Yarnold, who secured her country's second consecutive Olympic skeleton gold medal. \nThe following day, Aleksandr Tretyakov – who had won Russia's first Olympic skeleton medal in Vancouver – beat the 2010 Olympic silver medalist Martins Dukurs of Latvia in the men's event to secure his first Olympic title.\nHaving won two medals in an equal number of contests, Lizzy Yarnold, John Heaton, Gregor Stähli, Martins Dukurs and Aleksandr Tretyakov are the joint medal leaders in Olympic skeleton. Yarnold stands above them for winning gold at different games, the only person to defend an Olympic skeleton title. As of 2018, Great Britain are the most successful National Olympic Committee (NOC) in Olympic skeleton ranked by number of medals, having won nine medals (three golds, one silver and five bronze) and was the only NOC to have collected a medal every Games that skeleton has featured at the Winter Olympics until 2022; they have featured particularly strongly in the women's event, with three of the five gold medalists and six of the fifteen total medalists. The United States comes next with eight medals (three golds, four silver and one bronze). By the alternative measure of number of golds, then silvers, then bronzes, the US is the most successful, with Great Britain in second place."

        "text": "Snowboarding is an Olympic sport that has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or disciplines added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1990 and 2002, and was the only one not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after testing positive for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.\nEleven athletes have won three medals: Americans Shaun White, Jamie Anderson, Lindsey Jacobellis and Kelly Clark, as well as Canadians Max Parrot and Mark McMorris, Japanese Ayumu Hirano, Austrian Benjamin Karl, Slovenian Žan Košir, New Zealander Zoi Sadowski-Synnott and Russian Vic Wild. Out of these athletes, only White has won three gold medals. \nStatistics.\nMedal sweep events.\nThese are podium sweep events in which athletes from one NOC won all three medals."

        "title": "2007 Australian Open",
        "text": "The 2007 Australian Open was a Grand Slam tennis tournament held in Melbourne, Australia from 15 January until 28 January 2007.\nThe total prize pool was set at exactly A$20 million, with the winners of both the men's and women's singles competition each receiving A$1,281,000. Over 500 players competed in 2007. The main draw for singles and doubles was released on Friday 12 January 2007.\nIn Mixed Doubles, the scoring system was changed. Should both teams in a match become one set apiece, a match tie break will take part in the final set where the first team to score ten points wins the match. If the score for the match tie break becomes 9–9, a difference by two is required to win the game (e.g. 11–9, 12–10, etc.).\nNotable stories.\nNew technology used in line-calling.\nThis was the first time that the tournament used the Hawk-Eye system in an official line-calling capacity, as an auxiliary to the human line judges. Players were given the opportunity to challenge a human line call if they believed it to be incorrect, by having Hawk-Eye confirm or overrule the original call. The system was installed on only one court being used for the tournament, in the Rod Laver Arena.\nAt the beginning of a set, the players were each given the opportunity to incorrectly challenge a maximum of two line calls during the set. A player who still had some incorrect challenges remaining was allowed to make an unlimited number of correct challenges, but when a player had no incorrect challenges remaining, his or her opportunity to challenge line calls was lost. Players received an extra incorrect challenge during a tiebreak. The players regained both challenges at the beginning of each set and also after every 12 games in the final deciding set. Unused challenges did not carry over when this happened.\nAn additional aspect to the new system was that a video replay screen was installed inside the arena for the first time, to display the results of the challenges. The screen also allowed the spectators (and players themselves) to view instant replays that could previously only be seen by the television audience and those viewing the match on screens outside the stadium. This implementation caused noticeable drama in a match between No. 2 Amélie Mauresmo and Olga Puchkova in which Mauresmo challenged the in call on Poutchkova's shot and the replay showed the ball out graphically but still called the ball in.\nFactional fighting on day 1.\nOn 15 January 2007, around one hundred and fifty Australian youths of Serbian, Croatian and Greek origins were ejected from the Open after brawling with one another in Garden Square at Melbourne Park. The brawl reportedly developed after fans taunted each other with nationalist slogans. According to \"The Age\" newspaper, twenty police tried to quell the disturbance, which allegedly developed after an informal understanding between some Serb and Croat fans — that the two groups would not attend on the same day — was broken. The two opposing groups were ejected out separate exits and escorted away from the venue in opposite directions by police. No arrests were made, and no charges were laid against any of the participants.\nThe Greek supporters protested that they had not been involved in the taunts exchanged between the Serb and Croat contingents, though \"The Age\" reported that some Greek supporters had sided with some Serbs and chanted, \"Greece, Serbia! Greece, Serbia!\" and \"We must support our Orthodox brothers\". Serb fans claimed that the violence had been provoked by Croat use of the Croatian national flag, which in their eyes carried connotations of Second World War fascism, while Croats claimed that the violence was provoked by Serbs shouting anti-Croat, pro-Serb chants.\nA Croatian supporter suffered minor injuries in the ethnic brawl after being hit with a Serbian flagpole. People wearing Croatian or Serbian national colours were subsequently refused entry and the next day featured heightened security. Police in Victoria said that this sort of behaviour was never seen in the tournament before.\nWeather conditions.\nHeat in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) on Day 2 caused the Extreme Heat Policy to be implemented. Most daytime matches were delayed, and matches continued on outside courts till 3.30am the following morning. Janko Tipsarević chose to forfeit his match against David Nalbandian because of the heat. On Rod Laver Arena with the roof open, top-seeded Maria Sharapova nearly succumbed to the heat, losing a 5–0 lead in the final set, but managed to defeat Camille Pin 6–3. 4–6, 9–7.\nDuring the night sessions on Day 3, the Australian Open was affected by rain delaying play. Three men's matches were postponed in progress. The matches on Rod Laver Arena and Melbourne Arena were delayed for only 15 minutes while the retractable roofs closed. Marat Safin wisely requested that play be suspended while noticeably out of the match against Dudi Sela with Sela up two sets to one, six games to five, and 30-30. After the delay, Safin returned to win the fourth set and then the final set 6–0 to advance. This was reminiscent of the match in the 2006 Australian Open in which Marcos Baghdatis advanced after appearing rejuvenated against David Nalbandian. The match on Rod Laver featuring women's number two Amélie Mauresmo and Olga Puchkova was barely underway when the rains came.\nRain on day six caused play to only proceed on the covered courts of Rod Laver Arena and Melbourne Arena, for the duration of the day. Thus, only high seeds Maria Sharapova, Rafael Nadal, Nikolay Davydenko, Kim Clijsters, James Blake, and Martina Hingis were able to play their matches, as well as Australians Alicia Molik and Lleyton Hewitt. Players scheduled for play on the outer courts had to wait until Day 7, and faced the possibility of playing on consecutive days for the winners. Initially only 10 matches were scheduled for play in Laver and Vodafone, but the match between Andy Murray and Juan Ignacio Chela was moved indoors, to leave only five delayed matches in men's and women's singles.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n Roger Federer defeated Fernando González, 7–6(7–2), 6–4, 6–4\nWomen's singles.\n Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, 6–1, 6–2\nMen's doubles.\n Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan defeated Jonas Björkman / Max Mirnyi, 7–5, 7–5\nWomen's doubles.\n Cara Black / Liezel Huber defeated Chan Yung-jan / Chuang Chia-jung, 6–4, 6–7(4–7), 6–1\nMixed doubles.\n Daniel Nestor / Elena Likhovtseva defeated Max Mirnyi / Victoria Azarenka, 6–4, 6–4\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n Brydan Klein defeated Jonathan Eysseric, 6–2, 4–6, 6–1\nGirls' singles.\n Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova defeated Madison Brengle, 7–6(8–6), 7–6(7–3)\nBoys' doubles.\n Graeme Dyce / Harri Heliövaara defeated Stephen Donald / Rupesh Roy, 6–2, 6–7(4–7), 6–3\nGirls' doubles.\n Evgeniya Rodina / Arina Rodionova defeated Julia Cohen / Urszula Radwańska, 2–6, 6–3, 6-1\nWheelchair.\nMen's wheelchair singles.\n Shingo Kunieda defeated Michaël Jérémiasz, 6–3, 3–6, 6–4\nWomen's wheelchair singles.\n Esther Vergeer defeated Florence Gravellier, 6–1, 6–0\nMen's wheelchair doubles.\n Robin Ammerlaan / Shingo Kunieda defeated Maikel Scheffers/ Ronald Vink, 6–2, 6–0\nWomen's wheelchair doubles.\n Jiske Griffioen / Esther Vergeer defeated Florence Gravellier/ Korie Homan, 6–0, 3–6, [10–6]\nSeeds.\nThe seeded players are listed below with the round in which they exited.\nProtected ranking.\nThe following players were accepted directly into the main draw using a protected ranking: \nMedia coverage.\nCoverage of the 2007 Australian Open was as follows:\nExternal links.\n "

        "text": "Raül López Molist (born 15 April 1980) is a Spanish former professional basketball player. He played for the Utah Jazz of the National Basketball Association (NBA). López is a native of Vic, Barcelona, in Catalonia, Spain. At a height of 6 ft 0 in (1.83 m) tall, he played at the point guard position. López was featured on the Spanish version of the \"NBA Live 2004\" video game.\nPlayer profile.\nAlthough López was said by some to have been the Spanish version of John Stockton, his game was often described as more similar to that of Steve Nash and Tony Parker. He was known for his quickness, court vision, unselfishness, and passing ability. Also, he had the ability to create his own shot, which was a key skill in the modern NBA and EuroLeague.\nProfessional career.\nEurope.\nIn 1998, at 18 years old, López began his professional career with Joventut Badalona in the Spanish ACB League. In 2000, he was signed by Real Madrid where he played for two seasons. Later, during the summer of 2005, he signed with the Spanish local team Akasvayu Girona, which finished 7th at the end of the 2005–06 ACB season.\nNBA.\nIn 2001, López was selected in the first round of the 2001 NBA draft, 24th overall, by the Utah Jazz. In September 2002, he signed his NBA rookie contract with the Utah Jazz and underwent surgery to repair the torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, missing the entire 2002–03 NBA season. Finally, in the 2003–04 season, totally recovered from his knee injury, he played in all of the 82 regular season games as the backup to starting point guard Carlos Arroyo, while averaging 7.0 points, 3.7 assists and 1.9 rebounds in 19.7 minutes per game.\nOn 3 August 2005 López was traded from the Jazz to the Memphis Grizzlies as part of the largest trade in NBA history, involving five teams, 13 players, and two draft picks. He was subsequently cut from the Memphis Grizzlies 2005–06 roster.\nLopez' final NBA game was played on 15 February 2005 in a 95 - 102 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. In that game, Lopez played 12 minutes as the Jazz' starting Point Guard and recorded 7 points, 1 assist and 1 rebound.\nReturn to Europe.\nLópez returned to Real Madrid after signing a contract in July 2006. In 2009, he moved to the VTB United League club Khimki Moscow Region. In July 2011, he returned to Spain, and signed a two-year contract with Bilbao Basket.\nOn 3 March 2016, López announced that he would to retire from playing basketball at the end of the 2015–16 ACB season.\nNational team career.\nSpanish junior national team.\nLópez was a member of the Spain junior national teams that won gold medals at the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship and the 1999 FIBA Under-19 World Championship.\nSpanish senior national team.\nLópez was named, along with Juan Carlos Navarro, to the senior Spain national basketball team that participated at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. He also won the bronze medal at the EuroBasket 2001. However, before playing for Spain at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, he suffered an injury to his right knee, the same one that occurred during the 2001–02 season, while he was playing with Real Madrid.\nHe also won the silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and the gold medal at the EuroBasket 2009."

        "title": "China men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The China men's national basketball team (; nickname \"Team Dragon\") represents the People's Republic of China in international basketball tournaments. The national team is governed by the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA). Based on the number of tournament titles, China is considered a major basketball powerhouse in Asia and has by far the most successful basketball program on the continent.\nHistory.\nChina has traditionally been the basketball powerhouse in Asia and won the FIBA Asia Cup 14 out of 16 times between 1975 and 2005. At the 1984 Summer Olympics basketball tournament, the Chinese made their debut, starting a streak of nine qualifications in a row.\nAt the 2000 Olympics, Li Nan had a noteworthy performance as he scored 25 points on 6 three-pointers in a win against Italy. \nThe Chinese failed to defend its championship at the 2007 FIBA Asia Cup. This was due to the automatic berth at the 2008 Beijing Olympics as the host nation, thus, China sent its \"U23\"Team to the 2007 tournament and finished 10th while its primary \"A\" team participated at the 2007 Stanković Cup which took place around the same time as the 2007 FIBA Asia Cup.\nThe team often struggled against top flight non-Asian competitors. However, in some cases, China refuted their critics and beat some the top European teams. In the 2004 Athens Olympics, China, coached by Del Harris, advanced to the final eight after a 67–66 win over defending world champion Serbia and Montenegro.\nAt the 2006 FIBA World Cup, China, coached by Lithuanian Jonas Kazlauskas also advanced to the second round from Group D, earning two victories against Senegal and Slovenia in five group play matches before falling in the round of sixteen to the eventual silver medalists Greece, 95–64; the team's overall placing by the end of the tournament from amongst the twenty-four competing sides was fifteenth.\nIn 2008, some questions surrounded whether the recently injured Yao Ming would still captain the squad. In mid-July, it was confirmed that he would still continue to be the captain.\nAt the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, Yao ended up as the third leading scorer of the competition with 20.7 points per game while also leading in rebounds with 9.3 per game. The game where Yao really made his mark was against New Zealand where he scored a tournament-high 39 points while also grabbing 13 rebounds, second most in a single game that year.\nIn the following years, the Chinese faced major struggles with injuries. In 2008, a then NBA prospect Xu Yong was forced to end his career at the age of 19 after being diagnosed with osteosarcoma. In December 2010, Yao was diagnosed with a stress fracture on his left ankle – the injury was related to the ankle sprain that he suffered earlier that year. Speculations arose whether China's basketball icon would ever be able to play again.\nWhen Yao's retirement was finally announced in July 2011 it was considered a big blow to the national team, whose success had largely depended on him for many years.

        "title": "Ellerslie cricket club",
        "text": "Ellerslie Cricket Club (inc.) was formed in 1922 at a location known as Michaels Avenue Reserve, Auckland. The club has had some well-known players come to play for them in the past. Some include Ole Mortensen and English Internationals, Devon Malcolm and Wilf Slack. The home-grown legends include Bill \"Chook\" Fowler, Martin Pringle and umpire Barry Frost.\nEllerslie Cricket Club has 9 Senior Men's sides and 1 Ladies side and a roster of over 150 junior players. The club's mascot is the great racehorse Bonecrusher (known as the Pride of Ellerslie). The club colours are Black and Gold. The playing season is from October to March. The clubrooms are located above the YMCA on Michaels Avenue and are shared with Ellerslie Soccer Club.\nCurrent.\nUntil the 2005/2006 season Ellerslie's first team played in the \"First\" Grade of the Auckland Cricket Club Competition. As a part of restructuring of the Auckland Club Cricket, Ellerslie first grade team merged with Auckland University Cricket Club's first grade and collectively had two teams playing in \"Premier\" and \"Premier Reserve\" Grade respectively. This merge of Ellerslie first grade with Auckland University's first grade was for a 4-year lock in period.\nEllerslie now has stand alone sides in both the Premier and Premier Reserve grades.\nJunior cricket.\nOver the years Ellerslie has always suffered from a moving population which made it hard to gain junior cricketers and keep them through to senior level.\nGoing by photo's taken of teams in the 1920s the club had real strength and again in the 1950s. In the 70's a new influx of youth joined the club as it was critical by ACA rules that all clubs must foster junior cricket.\nIt is usually left up to a few keen parents to ensure the kids are looked after and coached properly and the club has been lucky to have them. People like Roy Schnauer, John Molesworth, Dave Cosgrove, Harold Butler, Wayne Young and many more were assisted by regular club members over the years.\nDuring the 90's Kevin Williams took over the mantel and has run the Junior section without fault. He has raised the junior membership to figures never realised in the past and has gained sponsorship for all teams. As a result of all his hard work the club is now seeing the youth moving into the grades and staying with the club.\nAlso the Junior Club has never had so many reps in both the district squads and playing for Auckland, this can only be a plus for the club in the future.\nLadies cricket.\nLike junior cricket it has always been a tough assignment to get a Ladies Team to be associated with the club but with winning comes recognition and in the early 80's Ellerslie gained a ready made team from ALHA made up of some very good cricketers including past NZ &amp; Auckland reps.\nThis team played in the top Auckland grade and were very competitive as well as a lot of fun in the social aspect of the club with the guitar playing evenings etc.\nThe current plays in the Women's First grade. They have won the championship in 2004/2005 season. In 2005/2006 season they came close but lost in the final which saw them being placed second.\nJubilees.\nEllerslie Cricket Club has celebrated two anniversaries over the past 20 years: the 60th in 1982 and 75th in 1997. Both occasions were special for the club bringing past members together and talking over past times and exploits.\nProbably the most celebrated occasion was in 1982 when the Auckland Racing Club named a race after the club and the winner's photo is still displayed in the clubrooms.\nThe 75th was also a special night with past members coming from as far a field as Australia and The South Island.\nRepresentatives.\nOver the years the club has had its share of players making representative level. The following are/were the rep players from Ellerslie (Apologies if anyone or the teams they have played in are missed):\nThere were also many others who made grade rep teams for Auckland over the years.\nClub professionals.\nWhen Ellerslie Cricket Club made the premiership grade they decided they needed a boost in player strength and coaching so it was decided to draw on the English County Professionals to help the club. The following is a list of the players (and a profile on their ability) who have graced the Ellerslie Club:\nThere are of course many others who paid their own way out to play for Ellerslie during their off season.\nPersonalities.\nOver the years the club has had many personalities through its ranks but some were to become or were more famous than just cricketers.\nOne thing about this club over the years is it has had many personalities, not as famous as those mentioned above but real personalities in their own right. Unfortunately for the readers' sake it is not possible to pass on the reasons.\nClub history.\nAs far as records show and from photos of earlier teams The Ellerslie Cricket Club was up and running in the early 1920s playing in the Auckland City &amp; Suburban competition. There proof that there was a wicket at the Ellerslie Gardens, now the Auckland Racing Club and an All England Eleven played an Auckland Twenty Two in 1877, so the club says if there was a wicket why not a cricket club?\nThe name of such a club is not known but the money is on it being \"The Ellerslie Cricket Club\".\nThe Roaring Twenties\nGiven all the facts, it is known the club existed in the 1920s and was very strong playing in the City &amp; Suburban Competition.\nOne famous name that appears in the photos is Charlie Kerr. Charlie was a great spinner and many say if he had played in the ACA competition he would have played for Auckland and maybe New Zealand but Charlie was a loyal C&amp;S man and later played for the Greenlane Cricket Club up until the mid Nineties which made him a very mature cricketer indeed.\nNot much more is known about the club in those days but there are photos and a picture speaks a thousand words.\nThe Fifties &amp; Sixties\nThe next era there is any history on, starts in the 1950s and this to is made up of photo's and some history related by some old time residents in Ellerslie but it is all very sketchy.\nThe club did cater for some very useful schoolboy cricketers in the late Fifties namely Rex Hooton who later went on to play for Northern Districts, Auckland and in later years coached Auckland. There is also John Wiltshire who went on to play for and captain Auckland.\nThe Club played out of The Ellerslie Domain in those days as Michaels Ave was just a gorse covered swamp but hard work and dedication by a loyal team helped by the Ellerslie Borough Council transformed it into an excellent sports field over many years. It was and still is shared by the Ellerslie Football Club and between them they purchased and located an old US Army building which became their clubrooms until 1979.\nDuring these years the club had just two Saturday Teams plus a Junior Team playing in the ACA within the Eastern Districts Association and enjoyed a good competition with clubs like Panmure, Mt Wellington, St Heliers and Parnell. They also had a very social Sunday team and every Sunday saw a huge picnic atmosphere at the Ave with cricket being the secondary fixture.\nStalwarts of the club were John and June Molesworth and through their hard work the clubs Saturday Teams flourished and later in the Sixties the club gained much needed new blood &amp; went from strength to strength into the 1970s.\nThe Seventies\nThis decade saw the club move from a mid grade club playing good cricket through to the ACA Premiership Competition in just 9 seasons.\nEllerslie Cricket Club started the Seventies with a strong committee dedicated to getting to the top and each year its overall player strength built up with players like Ross Hackett and Steve Chapman: two very good players from Australia. Ross played for NSW Juniors in his early years.\nOther players to strengthen the club in the early 1970s were Alan &amp; John Verral, Ian Rout, Graeme Atkinson and many others.\nIn the 1973/74 season Ellerslie won the ACA Major Club Championship for clubs with 4 or more teams in their ranks which was a great feather in its cap because from then on everyone sat up and respected Ellerslie as a club of the future.\nThat same year Ellerslie gained the services of Malcolm Beach from the Eden Roskill club and Stu McKay both very good spin bowlers and along with the talents of Steve Chapman and Blain Mahood both medium/fast bowlers. Ellerslie was starting to make heads turn.\nDuring the 1976/77 season the then Secretary of the ACA Mr Quinton Baddelly introduced promotion relegation twice a year and this timed in very well with Ellerslie's performances on and off the field and by winning each grade Ellerslie entered both at Christmas and at season's end they were knocking on the Premiership door.\nThis was starting to upset some of the old boys in the ACA but too late because in the 1978/79 season Ellerslie won its way into the ACA Premiership Competition and its First A side won their way into the ACA Senior A Competition.\nEllerslie was the first club to actually win its way into the premiership in decades as other clubs like Takapuna &amp; Howick Pakuranga were installed in the premiership purely on club numbers. Ellerslie won its way in by winnings and were proud of it.\nThe Eighties\nThe club really started to grow &amp; with the promotion to the Premiership competition. Ellerslie gained the services of two outstanding English professionals, Wilf Slack, a stylish left hand opening batsmen and medium pace bowler who was West Indian and Ian Gould an excellent wicketkeeper and right hand batsman. Both Wilf &amp; Ian hailed from the Middlesex County Cricket Club 2nd XI but in future years would both move on and play for England.\nEllerslie took the field in their first Premiership match against Suburbs New Lynn in a one-day match up against current Auckland and New Zealand players Peter Webb &amp; John Reid. Ellerslie won that match and this was the start of some very good years in the 1980s.\nUnder the captaincy of, first, Malcolm Beach and then Bill Fowler, the team progressed into a formidable cricket team gaining respect within the cricket community. Even though Ellerslie struggled some seasons while in their building stages, it never finished last in either the One or Two Day Competitions.\nThe 1983/84 season was the turning point for the club when it finished\nThis was the year of big, mean Ole (Stan) Mortenson: Ellerslie's English professional from Derbyshire. Stan was a fast bowler and hailed from Denmark; he terrified many a batsman and umpire alike.\nOther notable players of the day were the old sea dog Alan Hill and the young brigade of Martin Pringle, Martin Bradley, Mark Sumich, John McGregor &amp; Mark Keogh who were to be the nucleus of the team for many years to come under the captaincy of Bill (chook) Fowler.\nThis was not to be the last of Ellerslie's successes as they went on to win the ACA 2 DAY PREMIERSHIP title in the 1985/86 season and probably the main reason for this was a good all round team spearheaded by Devon Malcolm a very fast right arm bowler and another West Indian playing out of the Derbyshire County Club in England. Devon also moved on to play for England and took many wickets at test level.\nThis win was very exciting as once again Papatoetoe were Ellerslie's main rival with only 4.28 points separating the two teams going into the last match of the season but an outright victory over University saw Ellerslie through to its first major premiership title.\nAs well the Senior A also won the PRESIDENTS CUP as winners of the Senior A competition making the 1985/86 season the most successful in the history of the Ellerslie Cricket Club.\nOther One Day Championship titles were collected in 1986/87 over Takapuna, 1989/90 over Suburbs New Lynn and 1991/92 over Cornwall.\nEllerslie also played in the Premiership final against Grafton in a 3-day match at Eden Park but were outclassed on this occasion but finishing 2nd was no mean feat. Sadly a number of Ellerslie's premier players retired in the early nineties leaving a big gap to fill but it has had many fine performances since, with still many more to come.\nAs well as the contribution given by all the players over this period to gain such successes it would not have been possible without the undying presence of Frank (Bomber) Lancaster: the Premier Teams scorer. Bomber has hardly missed a game and is still turning up wet or fine to score for the team he has cared for, for over 20 years. Now that is dedication.\nThe Nineties\nThis decade started well but as mentioned, the retirement of some of Ellerslie's established players saw the club go back into a rebuilding mode and even though it had not gained great heights, the club has been steady. Financial woes affected the club like many other sports clubs in the later part of the decade. The ongoing committees have worked hard to fix the problems.\nThe Millennium\nAs is, of most sports, the success of the club is gauged on the top team and unfortunately due to a restructure by the ACA the Premier Team was relegated in early 2000s to a new grade called 1st grade with promotion relegation. Ellerslie is now (2006/2007 season) back in the Premier grade after Ellerslie's top team merged with Auckland University's first grade.\nGoing into season 2010/11 thanks to hard work from the committee the club is now once again a stand-alone Premier Club."

        "title": "Basketball Association of the Philippines",
        "text": "The Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) was the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) recognized national governing body for basketball in the Philippines. It was recognized by the FIBA in 1936 until 2007 when the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas or SBP was recognized as the new governing body of basketball in the country.\nIt had sanctioned mostly amateur and minor commercial leagues such as the NCRAA, UCAA, Mindanao Visayas Basketball Association and the National Basketball Conference with the BARECOM as its referees.\nLeadership crisis.\nThe Basketball Association of the Philippines leadership crisis worsened after a lengthy feud between the group of Graham Lim and Tiny Literal and the group of Freddie Jalasco and Lito Puyat in 2001, which resulted in FIBA's suspension of the basketball NSA. The squabble had been going on since 1995.\nHowever, a few months after, FIBA stepped-in and ordered an election that resulted in Literal's victory as the President of the BAP. The suspension was quickly lifted and the Philippines was able to compete in the Southeast Asian Games in Malaysia.\nPhilippine basketball crisis.\nIn 2005, the BAP-formed Cebuana-Lhuillier Philippine national team, made up of little-known amateur players, lost to the Parañaque Jets, owned by city vice mayor and comedian Anjo Yllana in the 2005 National Basketball Conference pre-season tournament. The Jets were bannered by actors and showbiz personalities, while the BAP team was supposed to have been sent to represent the country in an international tournament. This led to calls from Philippine Olympic Committee President Jose \"Peping\" Cojuangco to reform the BAP's programs and send a national team made up of professional players from the Philippine Basketball Association.\nHowever, disagreements became bitter in mid-2005 as both groups wanted to have their own groups represent the country to the SEABA Men's Basketball tournament in Malaysia. The BAP also replaced Quintellano \"Tiny\" Literal with former Philippine senator and Laguna governor Joey Lina as President of the basketball body. As the dispute continued, other National Sports Associations of the POC expelled the association as the National Sports Association for basketball in the country and created the Philippine Basketball Federation, Inc. as the new basketball governing body. The FIBA, meanwhile, continued to recognize only the BAP and instructed its leaders to sort out the issue.\nIn July 2005, FIBA suspended the country from all-FIBA sanctioned events, denying an opportunity to defend the SEABA crown, a qualifying round for the FIBA Asian Championships.\nTalks of unity would resurface as major basketball stakeholders the PBA, PBL, UAAP and NCAA and Joey Lina, then-BAP President to represent the BAP to form another new association, which materialized in March 2006, and was eventually known as Pilipinas Basketball.\nHowever, the talks stalled when Lina backed out from the group's formation. It was reported that several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power-sharing with Pilipinas Basketball. Pilipinas Basketball tried its luck to gain FIBA recognition from FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann but was denied, urging them to \"keep the course\".\nAfter another dispute between POC and Lina in forming Pilipinas Basketball in March 2006, both groups agreed to a joint communique to form a new cage body, later named the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, in order to resolve the conflict.\nHowever, resurfaced disagreements led to Lina quitting as BAP head after 1½ years at the helm, claiming POC's intervention in forming the SBP. Secretary-General Graham Lim also resigned from the SBP Board.\nAfter Lina's resignation, Philippine senator Jinggoy Estrada, son of former Philippine president Joseph Estrada, became the new president of the BAP. One of the first moves he tried to make was to request for the padlocked BAP office at the Philippine Sports Commission building to be reopened and to convince the POC to reinstate the BAP. However, those requests were denied, but Estrada was given an explanation by POC President Jose Cojuangco about the reasons for the BAP expulsion.\nEstrada would later work with the SBP on an agreement to unify the two organizations. The BAP board became irate and fired Estrada as its president. Once again, several members of the BAP were not willing to cooperate with the limited power-sharing with the SBP. Estrada stayed with the SBP as a special consultant. Philippine Amateur Track and Field Association president Go Teng Kok was named as the association's interim president.\nFIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann, however, fast-tracked the formation of the SBP, saying that the BAP could not back out of the \"Joint Communique\" which stated that the BAP had to cooperate and be merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form the SBP.\nThe association was intended to be dissolved and merged with Pilipinas Basketball to form a new basketball body. On February 5, 2007, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas which is intended to be a merger of the two.\nBAP remains an extant organization and is a member of the Federation of School Sports Association of the Philippines.\nCriticisms.\nIn its final two decades, observers criticized the said association for sending weak basketball teams in international competitions. It became evident when the country placed 15th out of 16 teams in the 2003 FIBA Asia Championships, their lowest ever finish in the tournament. Outrage against officials such as Secretary-General Graham Lim also became prevalent, as it is believed that he had much to do with the sending of the weak teams, while using politics to keep himself in power of the BAP. Leadership squabbles were not an uncommon occurrence, the most notable of which was one that split the association in two, stemming from the BAP elections on August 14, 1995.\nIt was also criticized back in the 1970s by team owners of the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association for its rough treatment of some member teams. This led to 10 companies bolting out of the league in favor of forming the Philippine Basketball Association in 1975."

        "title": "Japan men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Japan national basketball team (), a.k.a “Akatsuki Japan” (アカツキジャパン), is the national team representing Japan in international basketball competitions and is administered by the Japan Basketball Association (JBA), (Japanese: 日本バスケットボール協会, \"Nihon Basukettobōru Kyōkai\"). As the 1936 founding member of FIBA Asia, Japan has one of Asia's longest basketball traditions.\nJapan is one of the most successful basketball teams in Asia. It has won the Asian Basketball Championships twice and is the second leading nation in qualifications to the event. The team has qualified for the Olympic Games 7 times and for the FIBA World Cup six times.\nHistory.\nThe beginning (1917–1936).\nJapan's national team had its first international tournament at the 3rd Far Eastern Games held in Tokyo in 1917, at which Japan was represented by the team of the Kyoto YMCA.\nLater, the team was a founding member of the Olympics Basketball competition in Berlin 1936.\nEstablishment as a competitor at the global stage (1937–1976).\nAfter 1936, Japan Henceforth, they participated almost every time until 1976. Team Japan was a regular at world tournaments. It had its debut at the FIBA World Championship in 1963. It was the top team in Asia, as it won the championship there in 1965 and 1971.\nAt the 1976 Summer Olympics, Japan's Shigeaki Abe put up a noteworthy performance of 38 points and 10 assists against Puerto Rico.\nSince the rise of China, Japan declined a little bit and appearances at global events became scarcer.\nContinued success (1995–1998).\nAs runner-up at the Fukuoka Universiade in 1995, Team Nippon (as the Japanese are also called) had a streak of success and qualified for the 1998 FIBA World Championship, its first qualification in over 30 years. Coached by the Croat Željko Pavličević, the team played well but did not make it out of the primary round, where it lost its fourth-place battle against former Semi-finalist New Zealand.\nCompetition from the Middle East intensifies (1999–2009).\nIn the late 1990s, Japan played against more intense competition from the Middle East. Combined with many player absences from the team, Team Nippon struggled to win medals at the Asian Championships since its silver medal in 1997. At the 2008 event in their home country (Tokushima), the team finished at the 8th position and missed qualification for both the Beijing Olympic Tournament and qualification to the 2010 FIBA World Championship. At the 2009 FIBA Asia tournament the team sank to No. 10 position, its worst performance. This was partly due to the change of the head coach just before the tournament.\nRecovery (2010–present).\nOvershadowed by the drawbacks at international competitions, Japan brought forth several of Asia's elite basketball players who competed in the NBA and in Europe. These players included Yuta Tabuse, J.R. Sakuragi, Takuya Kawamura, Takumi Ishizaki and others. However, they rarely played for the national team, which caused Team Japan to fall behind Asia's elite competition from Iran, South Korea, the Philippines and China.\nTo better the results, the American coach Thomas Wisman took over the management of the team in 2010 and made some considerable improvements. Wisman just came off a phenomenal year in the Japanese Basketball League (JBL) where he had led Tochigi Brex to its first and only national title. At the FIBA Asia Stankovic Cup in 2010, Team Nippon was defeated by host Lebanon but exceeded expectations as it finished as runner-up. At the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship, the listed goal of the Final Four was missed as the team reached the 7th position out of 15. The team managed to defeat finalists Jordan but then lost to South Korea in the first playoff round and was defeated.\nIn March 2012, the Japan Association dismissed Wissmann and the country's coaching legend Kimikazu Suzuki took over the reins of the team. Suzuki, concurrently coaching the Aisin SeaHorses Mikawa had initial success as Team Nippon finished Runner-up at the next FIBA Asian Cup which was held in Tokyo in September 2012. Aimed at the acquisition of a 2014 FIBA World Cup berth, the team finished the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship at the 9th position where it lost its last three games.\nIn 2014, Yuta Tabuse and several of Japan's top players returned to the national team and helped to reach its best finish in almost 20 years.\nJapan will co-host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup along with Philippines and Indonesia.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nPast rosters.\n1936 Olympic Games: finished 13th among 21 teams\nRiichi Cho, T.Nakae, S.Ri, K.Yokoyama, T.Kanakogi, M.Maeda, U.Munakata, S.Matsui\n1956 Olympic Games: finished 10th among 15 teams\nSetsuo Nara, Jose Rodriguez, Kenichi Imaizumi, Hiroshi Saito, Reizo Ohira, Hitoshi Konno, Takashi Itoyama, Manabu Fujita, Takeo Sugiyama, Tetsuro Noborisaka, Riichi Arai (Coach: M.Maeda)\n1960 Olympic Games: finished 15th among 16 teams\nSetsuo Nara, Shutaro Shoji, Hiroshi Saito, Takashi Itoyama, Takeo Sugiyama, Kenichi Imaizumi, Yasukuni Oshima, Shoji Kamata, Masashi Shiga, Takashi Masuda, Kaoru Wakabayashi, Hideo Kanekawa (Coach: M.Maeda)\n1963 World Championship: finished 13th among 13 teams\nSetsuo Nara, Takashi Masuda, Masashi Shiga, Yasukuni Oshima, Kaoru Wakabayashi, Keizo Okayama, Isamu Yamaguchi, Yoshikuni Awano, Fumihiko Moroyama, Katsuji Tsunoda, Kunihiko Nakamura, Yoshitaka Egawa (Coach: Shiro Yoshii)\n1964 Olympic Games: finished 10th among 16 teams\nTakashi Masuda, Setsuo Nara, Masashi Shiga, Kaoru Wakabayashi, Fumihiko Moroyama, Katsuji Tsunoda, Kunihiko Nakamura, Yoshitaka Egawa, Nobuo Kaiho, Akira Kodama, Katsuo Bai, Seiji Fujie (Coach: Marco Antonio de Venetis)\n1967 World Championship: finished 11th among 13 teams\nKaoru Wakabayashi, Fumihiko Moroyama, Kunihiko Nakamura, Yoshitaka Egawa, Akira Kodama, Masatomo Taniguchi, Nobuo Hattori, Kenji Soda, Masahiko Yoshida, Isao Kimura, Seiji Igarashi (Coach: Shutaro Shoji)\n1972 Olympic Games: finished 14th among 16 teams\nKenji Soda, Masatomo Taniguchi, Nobuo Hattori, Kunihiko Yokoyama, Atsushi Somamoto, Hirofumi Numata, Shigeaki Abe, Mineo Yoshikawa, Kazufumi Sakai, Nobuo Chigusa, Satoshi Mori, Katsuhiko Sugita (Coach: S.Kasahara)\n1976 Olympic Games: finished 11th among 12 teams\nHirofumi Numata, Shigeaki Abe, Satoshi Mori, Norihiko Kitahara, Hideki Hamaguchi, Kiyohide Kuwata, Koji Yamamoto, Yutaka Fujimoto, Shigeto Shimizu, Fumio Saito, Nobuo Chigusa, Shoji Yuki (Coach: Masahiko Yoshida)\n1998 World Championship: finished 14th among 16 teams\nKenichi Sako, Maikeru Takahashi, Akifumi Yamasaki, Hiroshi Nagano, Makoto Hasegawa, Takehiko Orimo, Satoshi Sakumoto, Hiroyuki Tominaga, Takahiro Setsumasa, Makoto Minamiyama, Takeshi Yuki, Satoru Furuta (Coach: Mototaka Kohama)\n2006 World Championship: finished 20th among 24 teams\nTakehiko Orimo, Satoru Furuta, Takahiro Setsumasa, Shunsuke Ito, Joji Takeuchi, Kei Igarashi, Shinsuke Kashiwagi, Daiji Yamada, Ryota Sakurai, Kosuke Takeuchi, Takuya Kawamura, Tomoo Amino (Coach: Zeljko Pavlicevic)\nRoster for the 2016 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournaments:\nAt the 2016 FIBA Asia Challenge.\nKit.\nManufacturer.\n2015–2019 : Under Armour&lt;br&gt;\n2021–2022 : Nike, Inc.\n&lt;br&gt;\n2022–\"present\" : Jordan Brand\nSponsor.\n2015: Xebio\n2016: Sportsnavi live\n2017–2019: SoftBank"

        "text": "Keith Virgil Lockhart (born November 10, 1964) is an American former major league second baseman and third baseman who played for 10 seasons in Major League Baseball from -.\nLockhart, a left-handed batter, played college baseball at Oral Roberts University and was originally drafted by Cincinnati Reds in the 11th round of the Amateur Draft. He spent 8 full seasons in the minor league systems of three different organizations before earning a spot on the San Diego Padres' opening day roster in 1994. He played in 27 games with the Padres in his first year before leaving as a free agent and signing with the Kansas City Royals during the 1994 season.\nLockhart played for the Royals in both and . In his first season, he batted a career best .321, earning him a role as a platoon player in 1996. Sharing time at second base with Bip Roberts and at third base with Joe Randa and Craig Paquette, Lockhart hit .273 and drove in 55 runs.\nShortly before the start of the season, Lockhart and outfielder Michael Tucker were traded to the Atlanta Braves for outfielder Jermaine Dye, and Rule 5 selection Jamie Walker.\nLockhart stayed in Atlanta for six seasons, from 1997 to . He primarily served as a reserve second baseman and also served as a pinch hitter, contributing 59 pinch hits as a Brave. He served as a platoon player on two occasions with the Braves; in (a year which saw the Braves win a team-record 106 games), Lockhart platooned with Tony Graffanino, while in 2002, he platooned with Mark DeRosa following an injury to Marcus Giles.\nHe came close to being the hero of the Braves' epic struggle with the New York Mets in Game 5 of the 1999 NLCS. Lockhart, who came into the game as a replacement after Bret Boone was pinch-run for, hit an RBI triple in the 15th inning to give the Braves a 3–2 lead. The lead was squandered in the bottom of the inning, however, after a bases loaded walk tied the game; Robin Ventura's famed Grand Slam Single would later win it for the Mets.\nIn 2003, he returned to San Diego for what would be his last major league season and served as the backup to Mark Loretta. He retired at season's end with a .261 career batting average, 44 career home runs, and 268 runs batted in.\nLockhart was the final out of the 1999 World Series. Facing Mariano Rivera, he flied out to Chad Curtis in left field.\nIn 2011, his son Danny became a 10th round draft pick for the Cubs and has signed with their farm team."

Although not a First division team they are one of the leading provinces in terms of the number of lower divisional titles won.\nHistory.\nThe Whanganui Rugby Football Union was formed on 11 April 1888. It then joined the NZRFU as a foundation member in 1892. Wanganui's first official game after affiliation with the NZRFU was against the British and Irish Lions in 1888, with a 1–1 draw being more than encouraging for the union. In 1913 Whanganui played Australia and won 11-6 and in 1966 (with King Country) they won against touring side, British and Irish Lions 12–6.\nClubs.\nWanganui Rugby Football Union is made up of 13 clubs:\nChampionships.\nWhanganui previously played in the Second division North Island provincial competition and subsequently in the National Provincial Championship (NPC) Third division. In 2006 when the national rugby competitions were restructured, Whanganui entered the Heartland Championship, a competition for New Zealand's smaller provincial unions. They have been regular winners or finalists of Heartland trophies. \nHeartland Championship Team.\n2015 Steelform Wanganui Heartland extended squad\nForwards: Brett Turner (Pirates); Bryn Hudson (Ngamatapouri); Cole Baldwin (Border); Daniel Fitzgerald (Marist); Fraser Hammond (Ruapehu); Kamipeli Latu (Border); Kieran Hussey (Border); Lasa Ulukuta (Pirates); Malakai Volau (Utiku OB); Peter Rowe (Ruapehu)(Captain); Renato Tikoilosomone (Border); Roman Tutauha (Ruapehu); Sam Madams (Border); Tololi Moala (Pirates); Viki Tofa (Marist). * John Smyth Brought in as injury cover.\nBacks: Areta Lama (Kaierau); Ace Malo (Kaierau); Denning Tyrell (Pirates); Jaye Flaws (Taihape); Kane Tamou (Ratana); Lindsay Horrocks (Border); Michael Nabuliwaqe (Utiku OB); Poasa Waqanibau (Border); Samu Kubunavanua (Utiku OB); Simon Dibben (Marist); Stephen Pereofeta (Wanganui Collegiate); Troy Brown (Ruapehu); William Short (Ruapehu); Zyon Hekenui (Ruapehu); Trinity Spooner-Neera (Hawkes Bay)\nRanfurly Shield.\nWanganui v Taranaki challenge of 1964.\nA 15-all draw against the powerful Taranaki side of 1964 remains the closest the men from Wanganui have ever come to winning the Ranfurly Shield.\nInto the last minutes of the match Wanganui held a 12–11 lead and even if on paper and in the match itself they had seemed the inferior team it seemed as if they would hang on. Their hero was wing Colin Pierce who had kicked all of Wanganui's points from penalties to put them ahead even though Taranaki had gained tries to John McCullough and Ross Brown.\nWanganui might well have won as the match approached the final minute but for excitement of their supporters who thinking they were part of a historic moment as Wanganui had never won the Ranfurly Shield crowded the touchline.\nA desperate Brown had dropped for goal trying to gain the winning points. When it had missed Pierce had dashed to the 22 and taken a quick drop out. In the event his hurried kick had landed among the Wanganui spectators and they gave referee John Pring and touch judge George Brightwell a dilemma for they were both unsighted by the sideline mayhem were not sure whether the ball had bounced or gone out on a full.\nPring ruled that it had been on the full and so that last scrum of the match in what was the last set-piece took place on the Wanganui 22 and it was from there that Taranaki worked the move from which replacement wing Kerry Hurley grubber kicked ahead and won the chase as the ball bounced just a feet from touch over the Wanganui goal-line. And that was it: Taranaki had won 14–12.\nWanganui in Super Rugby.\nWanganui, along with Wellington, Wairarapa Bush, East Coast, Poverty Bay, Hawke's Bay, Manawatu and Horowhenua-Kapiti make up the Hurricanes region.\nAll Blacks.\nThere have been 17 players selected for the All Blacks while playing club rugby in Whanganui:\nAndy Haden (All Black 1972-85) was born in 1950 in Whanganui and attended Wanganui Boys' College before he played senior rugby for Massey University in 1970 and moved to Auckland in early 1971.\nCharlie Seeling (All Black 1904-08) started his rugby career for Wanganui before moving to Auckland from where he was selected for the original All Blacks.\nNotable players.\nJohn Blair.\nIn 1897 John Blair became the first of 17 Wanganui players to pull on an All Blacks jersey. Until the emergence of Bill Osborne in 1975, Ernest (‘Moke’) Belliss was without doubt Wanganui's greatest contribution to New Zealand rugby. Belliss made his representative debut for Wanganui in 1914 before enlisting to serve during World War II. He first came to national attention as a member of the New Zealand Army rugby team of 1919 which won the King's Cup tournament in Britain and then toured South Africa. Belliss played in the three home tests against the 1921 Springboks and captained the All Blacks in Australia the following year. Belliss has been compared to later players such as Waka Nathan and Buck Shelford. Commentator Winston McCarthy remembered him as hard, tough and fast, a good handler and a ferocious tackler. His opponents feared him and players of his era ranked him with the world's best. His son Jack captained Wanganui until the early 1950s and his grandson Peter Belliss was a flanker or lock for the side in the 1970s before turning his attention to bowls, a sport in which he won two world titles.\nBill Osborne.\nBorn and bred in Whanganui, midfield back Bill Osborne graduated from the Whanganui High School first XV straight into the Kaierau senior side. In 1973 he made his debut for Wanganui four days after his 18th birthday. Selection \nfor the New Zealand Colts followed in 1974 and he made the All Blacks for the waterlogged test against Scotland at Eden Park in 1975. He played in 14 of the 24 matches on the 1976 tour of South Africa. In 1978 Osborne lost his spot for the home series against Australia to Bay of Plenty's Mark Taylor. He won his place back for the end-of-year tour of Britain and Ireland and played in all four internationals as the All Blacks completed their first-ever Grand Slam against the home unions. Osborne and Bruce Robertson of Counties formed one of the great midfield combinations of any All Black era.\nIn all Osborne played 48 times for New Zealand, including 16 tests. Having retired in 1981, he made a comeback the following season, playing in two of the three tests against Australia before once more announcing his retirement. Again he had a change of heart and by now representing Waikato he was selected for the All Blacks side to tour South Africa in 1985. This tour was cancelled as a result of court action taken against the New Zealand Rugby Union. A replacement tour of Argentina was arranged but Osborne withdrew from the side. In 1986 he joined all but two of the 1985 selections on the unsanctioned New Zealand Cavaliers tour of South Africa.\nOther notable players.\nWhile they might not have reached the heights of Belliss and Osborne, Trevor Olney and Bob Barrell are typical of the unsung heroes of many of New Zealand's provincial unions. Between 1973 and 1990 Olney played a record 146 times for Wanganui. These were amateur days in which a player had to fit training and matches around a full-time job, so his commitment over 18 seasons was truly remarkable. Barrell scored a record 980 points for the union between 1963 and 1977."

        "title": "King Country Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The King Country Rugby Football Union is a constituent union in the New Zealand Rugby Union. It is located in the central North Island of New Zealand in an area known as the King Country. It was formed in 1922 when the South Auckland Rugby Union was split into three (the other two Unions formed were Waikato and Thames Valley).\nThe King Country team play from Owen Delany Park, Taupō, Rugby Park, Te Kūiti and Taumarunui Domain, Taumarunui. King Country, like many other heartland unions, have struggled since the start of professional era. In 1996, King Country were in the first division of the NPC and in just 6 years were in the third division. \nHistory.\nThe original King Country Rugby Union was formed in 1905 by the Manunui, Matapuna, Oio and Kakahi rugby clubs. In 1907, the newly formed Taumarunui rugby club replaced Oio.\nThe current King Country Rugby Football Union was formed in 1922, by the amalgamation of the first King Country Rugby Union (which was renamed as the Taumarunui Sub-union in 1922) along with the Ruapehu Sub-union in Ohakune (founded 1908), Maniapoto Sub-union in Te Kūiti (1907) and Ōhura Valley Sub-union (1920). These were joined by Otorohanga Sub-union in 1927, Kawhia in 1926 (founded 1920) and Kaitieke in 1933 with the Taupō Sub-union transferring from the Hawkes Bay Rugby Union in 1987. The Ruapehu Sub-union returned to its original parent union the Wanganui Rugby Union in 1970.\nThis was the second attempt to establish a Rugby Union in the middle of the North Island, as in 1920 the Rangatiki, Taihape, Ruapehu sub-unions (all affiliated to the Wanganui Rugby Union), and the King Country Union (affiliated to South Auckland) had applied for affiliation as the Main Trunk Union. However, this was declined after the Wanganui Rugby Union objected to the loss of their country players.\nIn those early years King Country representative games were held in Te Kūiti, Taumarunui and Raetihi or Ohakune. Ōtorohanga was first used for a representative game in 1939 with representative games also being hosted in Tokaanu (1966) and Tūrangi (1967).\nKing Country played in light blue and green until 1949 when it switched to maroon and gold hoops. In 1980, a maroon jersey with gold collar and cuffs was adopted. The current strip has been used since 1994.\nKing Country has made 19 challenges for the Ranfurly Shield over the years without success but having come close at times, going down to Taranaki in a hard fought game 11–15 in 1958. In 1969 they came even closer when good mates Colin Meads and Kel Tremain were the respective captains, King Country storming back from 6–19 at half time in a torrid second half before going down 16–19.\nA well known and amusing challenge in 1988 against Auckland at Rugby Park in Te Kūiti when “Boris the Boar” mysteriously got onto the field and camped in the Auckland 25 for much of the second half.\nWith the 2020 Heartland Championship cancelled due to Covid-19, the Rams played three First-Class Fixtures against some of their traditional Heartland Rivals. King Country lost their first match against Wairarapa-Bush in the inaugural Mead-Lochore Scroll Fixture (18–22). The won their second fixture versus East Coast (34–22) and in their final game they became holders of the Sir Colin Meads Memorial log beating Whanganui 16–11 in Taumarunui. This game was also Carl Carmichaels 100th first-class game.\nRanfurly Shield.\nKing Country have never held the Ranfurly Shield.\nKing Country in Super Rugby.\nKing Country along with Waikato, Counties Manukau, Bay of Plenty, Thames Valley and Taranaki make up the Chiefs region.\nAll Blacks.\nThere have had 8 players selected for the All Blacks whilst playing for King Country. The most famous King Country All Black is All Black of the century, Sir Colin Meads.\nAdditionally, former England captain and coach Martin Johnson played for King Country, during his early career. Further former Welsh hooker Garin Jenkins spent a spell playing for the province in his younger years.\nVisiting international teams to play King Country Rugby Union.\nKing Country Rugby Union has a long proud history of playing against many visiting international teams and playing them competitively. For a number of these games, King Country paired up with neighbouring unions.\nClubs.\nKing Country Rugby Football Union is made up of 11 clubs.\n&lt;br&gt;\nSecondary schools.\nKing Country is geographically a large union covering a wide area, however the population is very small, as a result there are only a few secondary schools within the region. As a result King Country Rugby Union doesn't have a consolidated Secondary Schools competition, rather the schools play their rugby in other provinces that can also offer better opportunity such as Waikato and Bay of Plenty Rugby Unions. These schools are still eligible for the King Country Secondary Schools and U19 Rugby Representative teams however.\nTogether these schools are able to challenge for the Sam Te Kaha Shield, which is a challenge shield between all King Country Secondary Schools."

        "text": "Robert Thomas Dooley Jr. (September 15, 1934 – May 9, 2018) was an American football official for 32 years with 14 of those years in the National Football League (NFL) from 1978 to 1992 as a line judge and referee. Dooley was assigned Super Bowl XV in 1981 as a line judge. In the NFL, he wore the uniform numbers 103 and 6.\nBiography.\nA native of Virginia, Dooley attended Andrew Lewis High School in Salem, Virginia where he graduated in 1952 and later attended college at the Virginia Military Institute, earning a bachelor's degree in civil engineering in 1956 and was a varsity football player. One year later, he earned a master's degree from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Between 1957 and 1960, Dooley served in the United States Air Force as a first lieutenant.\nIn 1960, after completing his tour in the Air Force, Dooley began a distinguished football officiating career. From 1960 to 1977, Dooley worked both junior high and high school football games and also officiated college football games from 1966 to 1977 in the Southern Conference.\nDooley was selected to join the NFL in 1978 as a line judge before being promoted to the referee position following his appearance at Super Bowl XV for the start of the 1981 NFL season. Beginning with his Super Bowl paycheck, Dooley signed away nearly every paycheck he received from the NFL for the next 14 years, which was an amount in excess of $500,000 to a scholarship fund he created at Virginia Military Institute called \"Matthew 25\", named after the Biblical passage. Dooley retired from the NFL following the 1992 season in order to spend more time with his family, but continues to supply funds to the scholarship with the checks he receives from his work mediating and arbitrating construction-related problems.\nOutside of the NFL, Dooley founded a company, R.T. Dooley Construction in 1977 based out of Charlotte, North Carolina. It specializes in commercial and medical buildings in North Carolina and South Carolina and has a staff of more than 100 employees. R.T. Dooley Construction made a policy to give a financial contribution every year to employees and other organizations.\nTom was married to Nancy and had three children, Nina, Bob, and David and lived in Charlotte, North Carolina. But now he was known as grandfather to his eight granddaughters."

        "title": "History of the Australian cricket team",
        "text": "The History of the Australian cricket team began when eleven cricketers from the colonies of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria formed an eleven to play a touring team of professional English cricketers at Melbourne in March 1877. Billed as the \"Grand Combination match\", the game is now known as the first Test match. Encouraged by a 45-run victory, the colonists believed that they had enough cricketing talent to take on the English on their own soil. A team organised and managed by John Conway, a former Victorian player, toured England during the 1878 season. After a discouraging loss to Nottinghamshire in the opening match of the tour, the Australians met a Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) team at Lord's on 26 May 1878. Australia's upset win by nine wickets was \"the commencement of the modern era of cricket\", according to Lord Hawke.\nThe 1860s.\nIn 1865, a match was arranged between a team of Aboriginal cricketers and European settlers from various pastoral stations; the indigenous team won. The playing of cricket by indigenous people of the Western District reflected their changing circumstances. At this time there were no formal associations.\nThe 1870s.\nThe 1870s saw the first official matches between English and Australian teams. Due to the amount of time that it took teams to travel from England to Australia (and vice versa), these teams were generally not a true representation of the best players for each country. At the time, there was no significance placed on these matches – statisticians later called them \"test matches\" between England and Australia.\nJames Lillywhite's English side toured Australia in between January and April 1877 and played the first two test matches after a drawn match against a New South Wales side.\nEngland in Australia 1876/77. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. Series result: Drawn 1–1. \nJust over a year later, an Australian side visited England and played a match against the MCC. In what turned out to be a match that was completed in one day, only 105 runs were scored with the Australian side emerging the victors by nine wickets. This match however was not granted test status.\nIn 1879, Lord Harris led an English side down under between January and March. This tour schedule involved a single test match followed by two series of two matches against Victorian and New South Wales sides.\nEngland in Australia 1878/79. Match length: Timeless. Balls per over: 4. Series result: Australia, 1–0. \nThe 1880s.\nAustralia toured England 5 times during the 1880s and played 27 Test matches. One of these matches was played in 1880, 1 in 1882 and 3 in 1884, 1886 and 1888 respectively. Losing a total of 15 matches. Note: Balls per over: 4. 16 of them were timeless matches while 11 were 3-day Test matches. During this time Percy McDonnell led the Australian scoring with 950 runs. Closely followed by Billy Murdoch on 860 and Alec Bannerman on 745. during this time Spofforth was the most prolific wicket taker with 94 wickets at an average of 18.41 runs per wicket. Palmer closely followed with 78 wickets at an average of 21.51 per wicket.\nThe 1890s.\nAustralia toured England 4 times during the 1890s and played 26 Test matches against them. (won 10, lost 10)\n\"Note: Half the Tests had 5 balls per over and half had 6 balls per over. Half of them were 3-day Test matches and half were timeless Test matches.\"\nList of Australian Test captains in the 1890s.\nThe Australian Test captains in the 1890s were Murdoch (2 Tests), Blackham (7), Giffen (4), Trott (8) and Darling (5).\n1900s.\nAustralian team started touring other countries such as South Africa which had Test status (first tour in 1903) and New Zealand for the first time in 1905.\nTest tours.\nAustralia toured England 3 times between 1900–1909 and toured South Africa for the first time in 1903. Australia played 33 Test matches in this decade winning 16 of them and losing 9. Most of them were against England and only 3 of them were against South Africa. Test cricket had for the first time gone to Africa. All the Test matches had 6 balls per over. Most of them were 3-day Test matches while 15 of them were timeless Test matches.\nAustralian Test captains.\nThe two main Australian Test team captains during this period were Darling and Noble.\nThe 1910s.\nAustralia were visited in the first two summers of this decade by South Africa and England respectively. In 1912 the Australian team toured England and played in the 1912 Triangular Tournament with their hosts and South Africa.\nAustralia toured USA and Canada in June to August 1913, playing five matches, four in Philadelphia and one in Toronto.\nNeedless to say, this was the decade of World War I. After the last match of the Triangular series in August 1912, Australia did not play another Test match until December 1920 when England, as the Marylebone Cricket Club toured Australia in a five Test series.\nThe 1920s.\nTest tours.\nAustralia toured England twice and South Africa once during this decade. Australia played 28 Test matches during this decade, winning 14 and losing 6. Most of them were against England and only 3 against South Africa. 5 of the Test matches had 8 ball overs. Most of the Test matches were timeless whereas there were 9 three-day Test matches and 3 four-day Test matches.\nAustralian Test captains.\nThe two main Australian Test captains during this decade were Armstrong and Collins. Both of them had a good record.\nThe 1930s.\nAustralia toured England thrice and had the first 5 Test tour of South Africa. Australia played 39 Tests in this decade winning 22 and losing 10. Australia also toured India and Ceylon in 1935 but no official international match was played although India got Test status in 1932.\nAustralian Test captains.\nThe leading Australian Test captain in this decade was Woodfull. Don Bradman led the Australian team in 9 Test matches in this decade.\nAustralian Test batsmen.\nDon Bradman, regarded by most followers of the game as the greatest batsman to have played the game scored 4625 Test runs in this decade at an average of 102.77 runs per innings with 19 centuries.\nSir Donald eclipsed other performances which would have otherwise had been noticed such as Stan McCabe's 2748 runs at an average of 48.2 runs per innings.\nThe 1940s.\nTest tours.\nThis decade was affected by World War II. Due to this Australia played only 17 Test matches. Their performance was impressive perhaps due to the Don Bradman factor as they won 13 of them and did not lose a single Test match. Most of the victories were against England. Australia were led by Sir Donald Bradman during this period. He scored 1903 runs at an average of 105.72 runs per innings.\nThe 1950s.\nEngland was no longer the prime opponent. Australia played 13 Test matches against South Africa and 10 against West Indies. Most of the Tests during this period were played with 8 ball overs and 5-day Test matches although Australia also played 22 six-day Test matches. Australian Test captains were Hassett, Johnson and the popular Richie Benaud who had an exceptional record during this period.\nAustralia's leading runscorer in this decade was Harvey with 4573 runs at an average of 50.25 runs per innings while the leading wicket taker was Richie Benaud with 165 wickets at an average of 23.95.\nThe 1960s.\nRichie Benaud captained Australia in 18 Test matches, Bob Simpson in 29 and Bill Lawry in 16. Lawry was the leading Test batsman. He scored 4717 Test runs at an average of 49.65 runs per innings while McKenzie was the leading Test wicket taker with 238 Test wickets.\nThe 1970s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 1970–1979\nAustralia's Record in ODI Cricket 1970–1979\nT: denotes tournament played between three or more teams\nThe 1980s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 1980–1989\nAustralia's Record in ODI Cricket 1980–1989\nT: denotes tournament between three or more teams.\nAustralian cricket during the 1980s was comparatively unsuccessful, particularly following the retirement of players such as Marsh and Lillee. Queenslander Allan Border, rated as one of the finest middle-order players in history, took over as captain and attempted a re-building process. For quite some time, the common wisdom was that Australia's score in an innings would be \"Border plus 100\". Border achieved the feat of scoring more than 150 runs in both innings of a Test during a tour of Pakistan during this decade.\nAs the decade continued, a number of talented players made their debuts and established themselves in the team. Among these were fast bowler Craig McDermott, wicket keeper Ian Healy, Steve Waugh and batsman Dean Jones. Cult heroes such as overweight Tasmanian batsman David Boon and Victorian bowler Merv Hughes also earned places in the team.\nIn the closing years of the 1980s, Australia won back the Ashes from England and began an era of dominance in that series which only ended in 2005. This decade was also notable for Australia's first Cricket World Cup victory, achieved in 1987 when they won against England by 7 runs in the most closely fought World Cup final to date at Eden Gardens in Calcutta. These two aforementioned victories are considered to have signalled the genesis of the team's rise to dominance, though at that point they were still behind the West Indies and failed to win any Tests in India or Pakistan. In 1986, Australia and India played out only the second tie in Test history, with Jones producing a famous double-century innings in sapping heat.\nThe 1990s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 1990–1999\nAustralia's Record in ODI Cricket 1990–1999\nThe 1990s saw the dawn and twilight of many well-known Australian cricketers Shane Warne became a household name during the 1993 Ashes tour, Allan Border retired after playing South Africa at Durban in 1994, Glenn McGrath became famous as a metronome (and as a rabbit) during the 1994–95 tour of the West Indies, Ricky Ponting came onto the scene with 96 against Sri Lanka during 1995–96, Craig McDermott was forced to retire during the 1996–97 season, while Brett Lee appeared at the turn of the century. Meanwhile, Australian cricket was run by three captains, Allan Border, Mark Taylor and Steve Waugh.\nAustralia continued to assert their dominance over The Ashes during the 1990s, won the unofficial Test 'world championship' prize from West Indies during 1994–95, won a second World Cup in 1999 and began a long winning streak in 1999, both in one-day internationals and Tests. The only venues where Australia struggled were India and Sri Lanka. The 1992–93 Frank Worrell Trophy series against the West Indies was the last Test series Australia lost at home until the 2008–09 series loss to South Africa.\nA year after losing to Sri Lanka in the final of the 1996 World Cup, Australia adopted a policy of fielding separate Test and one-day sides. The policy was intended to ensure that players were only chosen for the side for which they were suitable. This resulted in the immediate removal of captain Taylor and his deputy Ian Healy from the ODI team. The move proved successful, and was also adopted by other teams such as England and the West Indies.\nThe defeat of the then-dominant West Indies on their 1995 tour of the Caribbean is viewed as the moment when Australia became the dominant side in the world. Since then, in spite of a few occasions (specifically the 2005 Ashes series) the Australians have had an extremely high winning rate that compares favourably to the leading teams in history (much like the West Indies for the two decades prior).\nDuring the period from October 1999 till November 2007, The Aussies played 93 tests and Won 72 out of those. During the period they featured in 28 test series, winning in 24 of them and losing only twice.\nThe 2000s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 2000–2009\nDuring this decade, Australia's dominance has continued to the point that they have gone months sometimes even a full calendar year without losing a single match and have racked up many records along the way. Following Steve Waugh's omission in 2002 from One Day International cricket and, in his retirement in 2004 from Test cricket, Ricky Ponting replaced him as Captain and continued the team's international dominance.\nThe 2005 Ashes series 2–1 loss to England was considered a disaster. The return series in 2006–07, was, however, a resounding success, with the Australians completing a 5–0 whitewash of the English, a feat not witnessed since Warwick Armstrong's side in 1920–21. The 2006–07 season also saw the retirements of Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer. The Ashes were again lost 2–1 in England in 2009, this result reduced Australia to 4th in the ICC Test Rankings, their lowest ever position. Australia's dominance during this time extended to One-Day Cricket, with the Australians winning a third consecutive Cricket World Cup in 2007, following their successes in 2003 and 1999, and being undefeated in the 2003 and 2007 tournaments. Australia pulled out of their cricket tour of Pakistan because of Terrorism in Pakistan on 11 March 2008.\nThe 2010s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 2010–2019\nThe 2020s.\nAustralia's Record in Test Match Cricket 2020–current\nTournament history.\nWorld Cup.\nThe Australian cricket team has had a rich history participating in the World Cup. At present, they have won the World Cup five times as well as three titles in a row, the only team to do so. After the 2007 tournament, their dominance of the tournament can be analysed through the winning percentage of all countries which have participated, as Australia hold a 10% higher winning rate over the next best side.\nTheir dominance of the tournament in 1999–2007 was such that they won 23 consecutive games. To put this into perspective, the second longest winning streak behind this is nine straight victories by the West Indies team of the 1970s.\nICC Champions Trophy.\nThe Australian cricket team finally captured victory in the ICC Champions Trophy series after beating the West Indies in the final of the 2006 series and backed it up by winning their second straight ICC Champions Trophy by beating New Zealand in the 2009 edition in South Africa.\nICC knockout.\nThe Australian cricket team made it as far as the quarter-finals in the ICC knockout. They have reached the quarter-finals on two different occasions.\nCommonwealth Games.\nDespite topping their pool, Australia lost to South Africa in the gold medal play-off.\nAustral-Asia Cup.\nAustralia have entered the Austral-Asia cup three times. The best result came in 1990 in which they were runners-up.\nTwenty20 World Cup.\nThey reached the semi-final of the first Twenty20 World Cup in 2007 losing to the eventual champions India, but also lost to Pakistan and Zimbabwe in the group stages. In the 2009 World Cup they were eliminated in the qualification round after losing by six wickets to both the West Indies and Sri Lanka. In 2010 they were runners up after losing to England by seven wickets in the Final. In 2012 they reached the semi-finals but lost to the West Indies by 74 runs. In 2014"

The \"greens\" are called \"whites\" and have a maintained snow or ice surface.\nIt should not be confused with Crackgar, a form of snow golf belonging to the indigenous tribes living in Kalash Valley in Chitral, Pakistan.\nHistory.\nEvidence for golf as a popular winter pastime in Holland can be seen in numerous 17th-century paintings by renowned artists Aert van der Neer and Hendrick Avercamp. There is also evidence that golf was practiced on snow and ice in Scotland.\nSnow golf (ice golf).\nA high quality course is constructed each winter in Jämijärvi. A forested nine-hole course known for its 480 meters par-5 hole, tries to emulate the conditions of the summer game to a high degree. It also caters to events such as the Aalto University competition organized in 2011\nRecurring events.\nThe annual World Ice Golf Championship has been held on the world's northernmost golf course on the shelf ice near Uummannaq, Greenland since 1997. The course is reformed by the moving ice every year and play is highly dependent on weather conditions and thus, has been canceled several years running. Competitors are allowed a maximum handicap of 36. Clubs with graphite shafts are not recommended, as they can shatter in the extreme temperatures.\nA Snow Golf Championship in Argentina has been held in Cerro Castor, Ushuaia since 2008, by José M. García Daroca.\nA Snowgolf World Championship for amateurs was held in January 2007 in Abtenau, Austria. The event is hosted as a major Austrian celebrity event and sponsored by the state of Salzburg as part of the touristic scheme. Another Snowgolf World Championship took place in Obertauern, Austria. The new women's World Champion was Sarah Hölzl (Austria).\nAnother European championship event in snow golf was held in Switzerland during January 13–16, 2011. Seventy-two qualifiers were entitled to play the two-day tournament.\nThe Winter Golf Cup is an annual snow golf tour that visits four different ski resorts in the Alps, namely: Courchevel, Megeve, and Val d'Isere in France as well as Crans Montana in Switzerland.\nIn the United States, The Grimes Hill CC Invitational is an annual tournament held in the state of Vermont which pits golfers against each other in a three-hole playoff to determine the best snow golfer."

        "title": "Vine Cricket Ground",
        "text": "The Vine Cricket Ground, also known as Sevenoaks Vine, is one of the oldest cricket venues in England. It was given to the town of Sevenoaks in Kent in 1773 by John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset (1745–1799) and owner of nearby Knole House. The land is thought to have possibly been used as a vineyard for the Archbishops of Canterbury.\nSeven oak trees were planted on the northern edge of the ground in 1902 to mark the coronation of King Edward VII. Six were blown down in the Great Storm of 1987. In December 1987, seven new oaks were planted to replace those lost in the storm.\nThe ground.\nSevenoaks Vine Cricket Club and Sevenoaks Hockey Club, both sections of the Sevenoaks Vine Club, play on the ground which is owned by Sevenoaks Town Council. It is located to the north of Sevenoaks town centre alongside the A225 Dartford Road.\nSevenoaks Vine Cricket Club pay a rent of 1 peppercorn per year for the use of the ground, the archetypal peppercorn rent, but pay for the upkeep of The Vine even though it is common ground. The cricket pavilion, which is a Grade II listed building built in 1850, is rented separately by the Sevenoaks Vine Club. In keeping with tradition, the club pay Lord Sackville one cricket ball on 21 July each year. In practice this ceremony happens every year on the Wednesday of cricket week, which is the second week in July.\nA bandstand was built next to the pavilion in 1894 and the ground is overlooked by a number of residential properties, one of which, Vine Cottage, is contemporary with the establishment of the ground. The pavilion was renovated in 1934.\nCricket history.\nThe Vine is one of the oldest cricket venues in the world. Its earliest known use was for a match between a Kent team organised by Lord John Sackville against one from Sussex on Friday 6 September 1734, a game which Kent won. A fixture was played to mark the bicentenary of the occasion in 1934.\nSevenoaks Vine was a venue for top class cricket matches in the 18th century and is notable for being the first place in England where cricket was played with three stumps rather than two. A total of 24 matches which were given retrospective first-class cricket status were played on the ground between 1773 and 1829. These include nine matches between Hampshire sides and England and 11 matches featuring Kent sides as the home team.\nThe first recorded century in any form of cricket was scored on the ground in 1769, John Minshull scoring 107 runs for a Duke of Dorset's XI against Wrotham. Minshull, a professional employed as a gardener by John Sackville, went on to be the first player known to be given out hit wicket, again at The Vine, in 1773.\nThe world record for the highest known individual score in a top-class match was twice established at the Vine. First Joseph Miller, playing for a Kent team against one from Hampshire in August 1774, made 95 runs out of 240 and enabled Kent to win by an innings and 35 runs. Then, in June 1777, came one of the most significant innings of cricket's early history when James Aylward scored a record 167 for a Hampshire side against an England XI. In a contemporary report, it is stated that: \"Aylward went in at 5 o’clock on Wednesday afternoon, and was not out till after three on Friday\". Hampshire won by an innings and 168 runs in one of the first matches to use three stumps rather than two. Aylward's score was not surpassed until 1820.\nThe last use of the Vine for a top-class match was in 1829. The Vine was used by Kent County Cricket Club's Second XI for three Minor Counties Championship matches between 1952 and 1958 and by Kent Women between 1949 and 1973. The ground was not used for county matches by Kent County Cricket Club as it could not be enclosed due to its status as common land.\nThe ground is the home venue of Sevenoaks Vine who play in the Kent Cricket League."

        "title": "Gibbon's Tennis Court",
        "text": "Gibbon's Tennis Court was a building off Vere Street and Clare Market, near Lincoln's Inn Fields in London, England. Originally built as a real tennis court, it was used as a playhouse from 1660 to 1663, shortly after the English Restoration. As a theatre, it has been variously called the \"Theatre Royal, Vere Street\", the \"Vere Street Theatre\", or (as in Samuel Pepys' diary) simply \"The Theatre\". It was the first permanent home for Thomas Killigrew's King's Company and was the stage for some of the earliest appearances by professional actresses.\nThe theatre was destroyed by fire in 1809. The London School of Economics, which covers most of Clare Market nowadays, retains some squash and real tennis courts in its older buildings.\nTennis-court theatres.\nTudor-style real tennis courts were long, high-ceiling buildings, with galleries for spectators; their dimensions — about 75 by 30 feet — are similar to the earlier theatres, and much larger than a modern tennis court. The tennis courts were not used exclusively for tennis. In 1653, seven years before it saw lawful use as a theatre, an underground production of Killigrew's \"Claricilla\" was planned for Gibbon's court. The production was broken up before it debuted, reportedly betrayed to the army by one of the actors.\nAfter the English Restoration in 1660, Charles II granted Letters Patent to two companies to perform \"legitimate drama\" in London: the Duke's Company under the patronage of the Duke of York, led by William Davenant, and the King's Company, led by Thomas Killigrew. Both companies briefly performed in the theatrical spaces that had survived the interregnum and civil war (including the Cockpit and the Red Bull), but scrambled to quickly acquire facilities that were more to current tastes. Killigrew and Davenant both chose a solution that had been used in France: converting tennis courts into theatres. \nKilligrew's remodelled Gibbon's Tennis Court opened first, on 8 November 1660, just two months after being given permission by the Crown. The design was similar to the earlier Elizabethan-era \"private\" theatres, such as the theatre in Blackfriars: a stage devoid of scenery facing a bench-filled pit on the auditorium floor and surrounded by one or two levels of U-shaped galleries.\nCompetition.\nNot long after the opening, on 20 November, avid theatre-goer Samuel Pepys attended his first performance at Vere Street:\n…Mr. Shepley and I to the new Play-house near Lincoln’s-Inn-Fields (which was formerly Gibbon’s tennis-court), where the play of \"Beggar’s Bush\" was newly begun; and so we went in and saw it, it was well acted: and here I saw the first time one Moone, who is said to be the best actor in the world, lately come over with the King, and indeed it is the finest play-house, I believe, that ever was in England.\nPepys' high praise for the theatre is often taken to reflect his excitement regarding London's burgeoning theatrical scene rather than as commentary than on the quality of the tennis-court theatre itself. John Styan says it \"seems a questionable statement about so makeshift a theatre.\" Killigrew's competition, Davenant, would take another seven months to open his new theatre in nearby Lisle's Tennis Court; working more from the model of court masque venues such as Inigo Jones’ Cockpit-in-Court, he equipped it with a stage complete with a proscenium arch and moveable scenery, painted onto a series of sliding panels. Opening in late June, 1661, Davenant's theatre would steal much of Vere Street's thunder.\nBefore then, though, Killigrew would generate some more excitement of his own, by being the first to stage plays with actresses, instead of actors, playing female roles. The first occasion, based on its newly-written prologue, is thought to have been a performance of \"Othello\" on 8 December 1660; authorities differ as to the name of the actress who played Desdemona. Pepys records a 3 January 1661 restaging of \"Beggar’s Bush\" as \"the first time that ever I saw women come upon the stage.\"\nAfter Davenant’s theatre in Lisle’s Tennis Court opened, Vere Street’s popularity waned. Pepys, 4 July 1661: \"I went to the theatre [in Vere Street] and there I saw \"Claracilla\" (the first time I ever saw it), well acted. But strange to see this house, that use to be so thronged, now empty since the opera begun—and so will continue for a while I believe.\" To remain competitive, Killigrew decided to construct a purpose-built theatre more to modern tastes. On 7 May 1663, just two-and-a-half years after the theatre in Lisle's Tennis Court opened, the King's Company moved to the new Theatre Royal in Bridges Street. \nAccording to an 1811 Robert Wilkinson image, Gibbon's Tennis Court was destroyed by fire on 17 September 1809. In the 20th century, the Stoll Theatre and the Peacock Theatre would be built at the same site."

        "text": "Chertsey Cricket Club in Surrey is one of the oldest cricket clubs in England, the foundation of the club dating to the 1730s. The club is based in Chertsey and plays in the Surrey Championship.\nThree known matches were played in 1736, one against Croydon Cricket Club at Duppas Hill in Croydon followed by a return match at the Laleham Burway ground in Chertsey. A deciding game on Richmond Green was played on 5 July. In each of the two matches, the home team won \"by a great number of runs\".\nThe club played a number of matches against London Cricket Club and Dartford Cricket Club. In the 1760s, they played matches against the sport's rising power, the Hambledon Club, and in September 1778, Chertsey beat the rest of England (excluding Hampshire) by an innings and 24 runs.\nThe Duke of Dorset (who played cricket for Chertsey) was appointed as Ambassador to France in 1784 and arranged to have the Chertsey team travel to France in 1789 to introduce cricket to the French, apparently to improve Anglo-French relations. However, the team, on arrival at Dover, met the Ambassador returning from France at the outset of the French Revolution, and the opportunity was missed.\nChertsey produced several famous players in the 18th century including the great bowler Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens and the noted wicket-keeper William Yalden."

        "title": "2007 U.S. Open (golf)",
        "text": "The 2007 United States Open Championship was the 107th U.S. Open, held June 14–17 at Oakmont Country Club in Oakmont, Pennsylvania, a suburb northeast of Pittsburgh.\nÁngel Cabrera won his first major championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Jim Furyk and Tiger Woods, who were unable to birdie the 72nd hole to force a Monday playoff. Cabrera's victory marked the first U.S. Open won by an Argentine or a South American. It was the first of his two major titles; he won the Masters in a playoff in 2009.\nThis was the eighth U.S. Open and eleventh professional major held at Oakmont.\nHistory of the U.S. Open at Oakmont.\nThe championship committee of the United States Golf Association chose Oakmont Country Club as the host for 2007 on October 2, 2001. The USGA had also recently decided to award Oakmont its 13th USGA national championship, the U.S. Amateur, only four years before the 14th national championship to be held at Oakmont. Oakmont's prestige in the golf community was irrefutable as the list of champions includes Tommy Armour (1927), Sam Parks, Jr. (1935), Ben Hogan (1953), Jack Nicklaus (1962), Johnny Miller (1973), Larry Nelson (1983), and Ernie Els (1994). Oakmont had already provided the golf world with some of the most exciting championships of golf history including Miller's record for the lowest score shot in a USGA championship, a 63 (−8) in 1973, and the dramatic Monday finish in 1994 between Els, Loren Roberts, and Colin Montgomerie.\nPreparation for the 2007 U.S. Open.\nThe 107th U.S. Open was Oakmont's first USGA event since the U.S. Amateur in 2004. The USGA, American Golf's governing body, found setting up and preparing for the Open easier than other locations. Rob Zalzneck, the director of the 2007 Open for the USGA commented on the readiness of the course saying, \"We're so far ahead with our plans and what we need to get done, Oakmont is just such an ideal situation for us. The club welcomes us with open arms, and we've had such great championships here in the past. What everyone will see, though, is the unbelievable difference in the size of the event from 1994 (when Oakmont last hosted the Open) and this year.\" It was thought that the usual Open conditions would still exist, including the lightning fast greens and unusually high rough, as many of these features were common year round at Oakmont Country Club leading up to the Open. In fact, Oakmont's greens were so fast that the USGA directed the club to slow them down for the Open, although they were still much faster than what would be found at a normal tour event.\nPreparation began in 2002 and 2003 and included minor renovation to the course, most notably the lengthening of the course for the world's best players, small renovations to the clubhouse, and also the deepening of Oakmont's storied bunkers. Other changes to the course since the last Open in 1994 included the addition of a bridge to connect to holes 2–8, which posed as a major problem causing player and pedestrian jams over the Pennsylvania Turnpike. The USGA recruited some 5,000 volunteers in order to insure the event progresses smoothly. The event was expected to, like the last Open at Oakmont, attract record breaking sell-out crowds. Crowd control was also a major problem for the USGA and its volunteers as huge crowds filled the course during the tournament creating traffic problems. The USGA began selling tickets to the general public on June 15, 2006. The USGA was expected to sell out all of their tickets for the competitive rounds by their deadline for purchase on August 15, 2006. After the sale of all tickets for the competitive rounds, any post-deadline purchases were settled by a lottery.\nPartnership with American Express.\nFor the first time in its history, the United States Golf Association entered into a commercial partnership. It entered into an agreement with American Express for an undisclosed amount, which allowed American Express to set up a special \"Trophy Room\" area at the 2007 U.S. Open for American Express cardholders. Jud Linville, president of American Express U.S. Consumer Card Services, addressed concern about the arrangement commercializing the USGA Championship, saying, “We’re not going to be slapping logos all over the place, we’re trying to broaden the appeal of the game.” Long-time American Express sponsorship recipient Tiger Woods told the media in response to the deal, “It’s a tremendous opportunity, this is two enormous brands coming together to help golf.”\nField.\nAbout half the field each year consists of players who are fully exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open.

The shot moved the cut line from +11 to +10, eliminating 19 players (including Phil Mickelson, who had had the longest current streak of making cuts at major championships at 30).\nPaul Casey shot a 66 for the low round of the day when the average score was 76.933, the highest since the final round in 2004 at Shinnecock Hills. Stephen Ames' 69 was the only other score under par for the third round. The cut was at 150 (+10) and no amateurs advanced to the weekend.\nAmateurs: Harrell (+11), Ramsay (+12), Kokrak (+16), Davies (+17), Kelly (+18), Kuehne (+19), Golden (+20), Condello (+22), Pettitt Jr (+23), Prugh (+23), Ureta (+23), Lee (WD).\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 16, 2007\"\nAaron Baddeley shot a second straight even-par round of 70, including a birdie on the 18th hole, to take a two-shot lead heading into the final round. Tiger Woods hit the first 17 greens in regulation en route to a 1-under 69, barely needing to work to save par until his only bogey on the last hole, and finished in second place two shots behind Baddeley. It was one of just two under-par rounds on the day (Steve Stricker shot a 68), and placed Woods in the final pairing on Sunday. To this point in his career, Woods had never won a major championship by coming from behind, which he would have had to do to win his third U.S. Open. Four players were one stroke behind Woods at 215 (+5).\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 17, 2007\"\nÁngel Cabrera shot a 1-under 69 to become the first Argentinian to win the U.S. Open. He entered the final round four shots behind, after shooting a disappointing 76 on Saturday. This gave him a 2:20 pm tee time on Sunday, 40 minutes ahead of the final pairing, which included Tiger Woods. After a birdie on the 15th hole, Cabrera was 3-under for the round, with a three stroke lead over Woods and a surging Jim Furyk.\nAfter bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes that reduced his lead to one, Cabrera parred the difficult 18th hole and then had to wait in the clubhouse for Furyk and Woods to finish. Furyk tied for the lead with 3 straight birdies from 13-15 but bogeyed 17 to fall 1 stroke behind. Both Furyk and Woods needed to birdie the 72nd hole to force a Monday playoff but neither did, giving Cabrera the victory by a single stroke. Cabrera and Anthony Kim (67) were the only players to post sub-par scores during the final round. Aaron Baddeley was the 54-hole leader, but opened with a triple bogey and shot 80 (+10). The field broke par for only eight rounds during the tournament, just two players per day on the difficult Oakmont layout, and Cabrera was the only player to break par twice.\n\"Full final leaderboard\" &lt;br&gt;\nThe top eight finishers at the U.S. Open were automatically invited to the 2008 Masters and the top fifteen automatically qualified for the 2008 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The Los Gatos Rowing Club was started in 1979 to provide what was then mostly an eastern U.S. sport, to the kids in the Santa Clara Valley. In the past 20 years, more than 2,000 kids from 15 different high schools have passed through the program. Many have gone onto colleges and universities to row competitively, several have received rowing scholarships, and a few have been selected for Junior National Camps and are trying for the Olympics.\nIn 1994, the old boathouse was destroyed by an arsonist. Through the efforts of a highly motivated group of parents, coaches, and a huge number of new masters members, the boathouse was rebuilt on Lexington Reservoir. Without missing a single season, this group built a temporary boathouse of storage containers while they rushed about acquiring loans, grants and donations. Within two years the land, building and boats had all been acquired – one day before the time expired for the temporary boathouse to be dismantled.\nLos Gatos Rowing Club currently provides both youth (middle school through high school) and masters programs, as well as community outreach programs including a program designed to introduce rowing to special youth and adults, a veterans' group, and a class for cancer survivors and caregivers.\nJunior Team.\nLos Gatos Rowing Club high school program, called Junior Rowing, offers the rowing and racing experience to approximately 150 students from 10 Bay Area high schools such as Los Gatos High School, Bellarmine, Saint Francis, Presentation, Leigh, and Saratoga High School. The Junior spring season begins in January and runs through May, while the Junior Fall season starts in September and runs through to December. Weekday practices take place after school and weekend practices are in the early morning. Practice for novice is usually five days a week, while varsity often practices six or seven days. Each year, LGRC hosts at least one home regatta and travels to as many as 8 away competitions.\nThe Novice team consists of first year rowers, ages 14–18, regardless of their year in high school. Some novice rowers start early with the Autumn introductory conditioning program, held September through December.\nThe Varsity team consists of rowers who have already participated as Novice rowers or new participants whom the coaches feel have the ability to participate at the more advanced skill level.\nMany LGRC rowers have been invited to the USRowing Youth National Championships. The event has been held each year in Cincinnati, Ohio for the first 16 years since its creation. Recently, the event location has changed to Oak Ridge, Tennessee with the 2014 championship to be held in Gold River, California. Boats can qualify at the Southwest Regional Championships which usually takes place in May.\nVarsity Team Boats\nBoth Men and Women's Varsity teams consist of about 3-5 different boat rankings.\n1st Boat = Varsity 8\n2nd Boat = Jv8/lightweight 8... These can be two separate boats, or the same boat.\n3rd Boat = 3v8\n4th boat = 4v8\n5th boat = 5v8\nNovice Team Boats\nBoth the Men and Women's Novice team consist of about 3-5 different boat rankings.\n1st Boat = A Boat\n2nd Boat = B Boat\n3rd Boat = C Boat\n4th Boat = D Boat\nUnranked Boat (can be either good or bad) = Freshman Boat\nNational Tournament Success\nOver the years the club has enjoyed success at the national level, including:\nMasters Rowing Teams.\nThe club also offers both facilities and coaching for masters (over 27) in both sweep rowing and sculling. The masters novice program meets in the early mornings, before work, and is for both men and women who have never rowed before, or are just starting their rowing careers. The women's and men's competitive coached programs also meet in the early mornings and is for those who have some years of rowing experience. This group competes locally, nationally, and internationally. Rowers with or without experience are welcome and should contact the club via the website. Masters rowers have rowed with success at various events all over the world as well as locally, winning US Rowing National medals and FIFA Masters Worlds medals, and have tried out for and represented a variety of nations at Olympic level."

        "text": "Donald E. Scott (died October 1, 1943) was a star of American football. He was a two-time All-American quarterback at Ohio State University. As a pilot Scott had already completed nine bombing missions during World War II, on October 1, 1943, while going through a special training exercise in England, Scott's bomber crashed, taking his life at just age 23. \nHigh school star.\nIn football, Scott was a two-time all-state selection at Canton McKinley High School. As a sophomore Scott was a tackle on the offensive and defensive lines. He also punted and kicked extra points. As a junior and senior he was named the left halfback in a single-wing formation offense, making him the team's primary ball handler. He completed 58 percent of his passes (48 of 93) for 991 yards and 11 touchdowns. He also rushed for 657 yards on 74 carries. He kicked 34 extra points.\nIn basketball, Scott twice helped lead the school team to the state semifinals.\nCollege career.\nScott was a two-time All-American selection for the Ohio State University Buckeyes football team. He was called the most versatile back in college football because he was a brilliant passer, blocker, and ball carrier. His head coach, Francis Schmidt, later said, \"I can’t remember a back as dangerous in so many departments of play.”\nScott lettered for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team in 1938, 1939, and 1940. In 1938 he was a starting halfback. He became the Buckeyes' starting quarterback as a junior in 1939 and led the team to the Big Ten Conference title. That year, he received his first All-American selection. He returned as quarterback in his senior year and was again named as All American.\nScott also played basketball for one season. The 1938-39 Ohio State team appeared in the first NCAA basketball tournament, and advanced to the first NCAA championship game. Oregon beat the Buckeyes 46-33.\nWar and death.\nScott was the ninth overall selection in the first round of the 1941 NFL Draft. He was selected by the Chicago Bears. Scott decided to volunteer to fight in the war in Europe. Scott had participated in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, sponsored by the Civil Aeronautics Administration, while at Ohio State. When he entered the United States Army Air Forces it was as a commissioned pilot.\nOn October 1, 1943, Capt. Don Scott died when his B-26 Marauder bomber crashed in England while he was in training. He was buried in Canton, Ohio. The following month, Ohio State University trustees named the school's new airport after him."

He was the brother of Don and Neil Fox, and together they formed one of the legendary rugby league families.\nCareer.\nHe had a 13-year playing career with; Sharlston Rovers, Featherstone Rovers (Heritage № 349), Batley, Hull Kingston Rovers (Heritage №), Hunslet and Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 723), he became one of British rugby league's most successful coaches.\nPeter Fox was the coach in Featherstone Rovers' 33-14 victory over Bradford Northern in the 1973 Challenge Cup Final during the 1972–73 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 12 May 1973, in front of a crowd of 72,395, and was the coach in the 9-24 defeat by Warrington in the 1974 Challenge Cup Final during the 1973–74 season at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 11 May 1974, in front of a crowd of 77,400.\nBramley won promotion to Division One, under Peter Fox in the 1976-77 season.\nHe coached Great Britain and England, which included beating the Australians in 1978.\nHe coached Bradford Northern in two spells one in 1977 where he had a very successful spell winning the championship in 1979-80 and 1980-81.\nHe returned to Bradford Northern for a second spell in 1991, and in the 1993-94 season Bradford Northern finish as runners-up in the Championship behind Wigan on points difference.

        "title": "Rob Johnson (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert James Johnson (born July 22, 1982) is an American former Major League Baseball catcher and pitcher who played for the Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals from 2007 to 2013.\nAmateur career.\nJohnson attended Saddleback College, Mission Viejo, California, and was named MVP of the Orange Empire League in . In 2003, he attended the University of Houston for one season. In the summer of 2003, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. He was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in 4th round (123rd overall) of the 2004 Major League Baseball Draft.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nFollowing a breakout season, Seattle Mariners General Manager Bill Bavasi promoted Johnson to the Triple-A level Tacoma Rainiers at the start of the . After the free agent signing of Japanese baseball star catcher Kenji Johjima and the selection of USC slugging catcher Jeff Clement, Johnson moved down the Mariners organizational depth chart. In , he was named the Tacoma Rainiers team captain.\nJohnson made his Major League Debut on September 4, , and played sparingly for the rest of the campaign with the Mariners. He had 1 hit (his first in MLB) in 3 at-bats for a batting average of .333, he also stole a base during his callup, during which he appeared in 6 games.\nJohnson was recalled to Seattle for the final month of the season when the rosters expanded from 25 to 40 for the month of September during which he hit his first major league home run, a two-run blast off of Jerry Blevins of the Oakland Athletics in a game on September 27 at Safeco Field. He played in the Arizona Fall League after the season.\nGoing into spring training it was thought that catcher Jeff Clement would be the back-up catcher and designated hitter on the opening day roster. However, with the signing of the left-handed hitting Ken Griffey Jr., Clement would have little playing time at the designated hitter position. This left the door open for Johnson on the opening day roster.\nIn 2009, Johnson cracked the opening day roster with the Mariners for the first time in his career. Primarily used as a back-up catcher in the beginning on the season, Johnson later became the a starter due to his good rapport with the Mariners' pitching staff and an early season injury to primary catcher Kenji Johjima. When Johjima was activated from the disabled list Johnson again became the back-up catcher. However, Johjima again went on the disabled list in late-May and Johnson became the primary catcher again. Mariners manager Don Wakamatsu stated that Johnson handled the pitching staff better than Johjima.\nOn June 13, Johnson was placed on the bereavement list to respond to a \"family emergency\". On June 19, he was activated from the bereavement list.\nIn a 7–6 Mariners win over the Boston Red Sox, Johnson tied a club record with three doubles in one game on July 3. His third double of the game became the decisive hit as it scored the winning run for the Mariners in the top of the 11th inning in Fenway Park.\nAt season's end it was reported that Johnson would undergo three surgeries, the first on his left hip, the second on his right hip and the third on his left wrist. He is expected to make a recovery in time for spring training. Johnson's hip ailments were detected during an MRI exam on October 5 in Seattle, Washington. It is a similar injury sustained by the New York Yankees third baseman Alex Rodriguez.\nJohnson's 2010 season was a disappointment, hitting .191/.293/.281 in 61 games for the Mariners. He was demoted to the AAA Tacoma Rainiers on August 3, where he hit .297/.403/.453 in 19 games. On December 13, he was designated for assignment by the Mariners.\nSan Diego Padres.\nJohnson was claimed by the San Diego Padres on December 21, 2010. In return, the Mariners received cash considerations or a player to be named later.\nNew York Mets.\nOn December 22, 2011, Johnson signed a minor league deal with the New York Mets with an invite to spring training. On May 8, 2012, Johnson was called up after Josh Thole was sent to the 7-day disabled list. On May 18, 2012, Johnson pitched a 1-2-3 bottom of the eighth inning against the Toronto Blue Jays, a game which the Blue Jays won 14–5. Johnson became the first position player to pitch for the Mets since July 26, 2004, when infielder Todd Zeile took the mound for the Mets in Montreal. After hitting .313/.371/.344 over 34 at-bats while sharing time behind the plate with Mike Nickeas, Johnson was optioned to Triple-A Buffalo upon Thole's return on June 1. On June 25, he was recalled after Nickeas was farmed out, only to get sent back down to Buffalo on August 15 after the Mets traded for Kelly Shoppach. The move was rescinded and Johnson was placed on the disabled list after it was discovered he had suffered a torn ligament in his left thumb. His season over, Johnson was outrighted off the Mets' 40-man roster October 17 and became a free agent.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nOn November 13, 2012, Johnson signed a minor league deal with the St. Louis Cardinals with an invitation to participate in spring training as a non-roster player. His contract was purchased from AAA-Memphis and called up on July 9, 2013. Johnson was called in to pitch to secure the final out in a 13–4 loss to the Dodgers on August 7, 2013. He struck out Dodger's rookie pitcher Paco Rodriguez on 4 pitches. Johnson was given his outright release by the Cardinals on November 5, 2013 and elected free agency. He had 35 total at-bats with St. Louis in the 2013 season.\nReturn to Padres and retirement.\nJohnson signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres in February 2014, intending to switch to pitching full-time. However, after being sidelined in the spring due to elbow pain, Johnson learned that he had torn the ulnar collateral ligament in his throwing arm, and would need to undergo Tommy John surgery in order to catch again\nOn May 23, 2014, Johnson announced via his official Facebook page that he had chosen to retire from professional baseball.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in Butte, Montana he played Little League in Whitehall. He attended Butte Central Catholic High School (graduated 2001). He played for the local American Legion team (Montana and Wyoming are the only states to not include baseball on a High School level). He worked on his family ranch through his junior year in high school.\nFamily.\nHe currently resides in Austin, Texas. He has four children. Married Kristan Bettis Johnson in 2006."

        "title": "Chile national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Chilean national rugby union team (Spanish: \"Selección de rugby de Chile\") represents the Chilean Rugby Federation () in men's international rugby union. Nicknamed Los Cóndores (\"The Condors\" in English), they play in red and white jerseys. They are currently ranked 22nd in the World Rugby Rankings, making them the third highest-ranked nation in South America.\nChile was the second South American nation after Argentina to play international rugby union, playing their first international test against Argentina in 1936 in Santiago. Chile is one of the founding members of CONSUR (now known as Sudamérica Rugby) in 1989, alongside Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. Chile has long been participating in the South American Rugby Championship since 1951 and has consistently been the third or even the second best team in South America. In 2016, Chile, alongside the unions of Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the United States, and Uruguay, formed the Americas Rugby Championship, aimed at increasing the standard of rugby union in the Americas region.\nChile qualified for the 2023 Rugby World Cup, which will be their first appearance in the tournament; they upset Canada in a two-game series in October 2021, before defeating the United States in a two-game home-and-home series on aggregate by 1 point in July 2022. Chile were drawn with England, Japan, Argentina, and Samoa in Pool D of the World Cup.\nThe sport has historic connections to the Scottish community in the country. In 2012, two Scottish-Chilean players, Donald and Ian Campbell, were inducted into the IRB (now World Rugby) Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1890s – 1959).\nRugby was introduced in Chile roughly around the late 19th century, as it was in other parts of South America by British immigrants who arrived in ports. The first recorded rugby game taking place on Chilean soil was in 1894, from British immigrants who lived in both Santiago, Iquique and Valparaíso. Until the 1930s, the game was initially mostly played by the British-descended community of Chile. In 1935, the Chilean Rugby Federation was founded.\nChile's first ever fixtures were against Argentina in September 1936, a two-game series played in the capital Santiago. Chile lost both of their games by scorelines of 0 to 20 and 3 to 31, respectively. Chile would visit Argentina in 1938 in Buenos Aires, losing 3 to 33. Chile would not play another fixture until 1948, where they beat Uruguay 21 to 3 in Buenos Aires.\nThe Chilean team began competing more consistently in the 1950s. In 1951, Chile played the first South American Rugby Championship against Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina in 1951; Chile finished third, beating Brazil by a margin of 68 to nil, but losing to both Uruguay and Argentina. In 1952, Chile received Ireland on tour, but lost in Santiago 30 to 0. Chile would play another Five Nations side, this time France on tour, but lost 34–3. In 1958, Chile participated in the second South American Rugby Championship, finishing second; Chile easily beat both Peru and Uruguay before falling to Argentina, finishing second.\n1960s – 1980s.\nBy the 1960s Chile saw itself established as a middle contender in South America. Chile were consistently beating sides like Brazil and Uruguay, but couldn't breakthrough against the mighty Argentina. In 1966, Chile received the Springboks, their first test against a SANZAR side, but lost 72 to 0. During the 1970s Chile didn't play any non-South American competition; for the most part Chile were finishing second or third in South America, usually beating Brazil and newcomers Paraguay, and dog fighting for second against Uruguay. In the 1980s, former coach of France Jean-Pierre Juanchich took over administration of rugby in Chile, which led to better promotion, awareness, and improvement in Chilean rugby. In 1989, a proper governing body for rugby in South America, CONSUR, was formed.\n1990s – 2000s.\nChile formally joined the International Rugby Board in 1991, allowing Chile to participate formally in World Cup competitions. In 1993, Chile participated in its first ever World Cup Qualifying competition in 1993, entering qualifying for the 1995 Rugby World Cup; however, they lost all their fixtures to Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, finishing bottom of the group. In 1995, Chile played Spain, winning 28 – 23.\nThe 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying campaign was more successful. Chile easily swept through a group containing the teams of Bermuda and Trinidad and Tobago. However, Chile lost 14 to 20 against Uruguay, therefore missing out on a repechage spot, and potentially a spot in the World Cup.\nIn 2000, Chile came within 2 points of defeating Argentina. This improved form would continue through the early 2000s, easily disposing of Brazil in their first qualifier for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. In the final round, a round robin containing Canada, Uruguay, and the United States, the Chileans won their first home fixture versus Uruguay before losing their next two to the US and Canada. Despite this, Chile recorded an upset, defeating the United States 21 to 13 in Santiago. Despite being improved, Chile dropped their next two games, finishing the campaign with 2 wins and 4 losses. Unfortunately for Chile, they finished bottom on try difference, yet again missing out on a repechage spot, and potential qualification.\nChile then took part at an Intercontinental Cup at home in Santiago in November 2004. Where they recorded arguably one their greatest victories at the time, defeating an up and coming Georgia side 30-24.\nThe 2007 qualifiers were mostly the same song as the previous campaigns; Chile swept their first round against Paraguay and Brazil but in the final group lost both their games to Argentina and Uruguay, which once again would have secured a repechage at least, and potentially an automatic spot in the World Cup.\nThe 2011 campaign was short-lived, having automatically been seeded into Round 3A of the qualifiers in the new format. Chile cruised to victory versus Brazil but once again lost to familiar foes Uruguay, and once again missing out on a potential repechage or automatic qualifier.\n2010–present.\nIn 2010, Chile nearly started the new decade with a bang, coming very close to defeating Oceania powerhouse Tonga, but losing 32–30. The following year in 2011, Chile beat Uruguay for the first time in nine years, winning 21–18 and finishing second in the South American Championship.\nThe decade has been marked by inconsistency in results. In 2013, Chile began their qualifying campaign, opening up with a victory versus Brazil, but yet again lost to foes Uruguay, following the same pattern of results since the 1999 campaign. In 2014, Chile reached a bottom point; in the 2014 South American Championship, they finished bottom of the group, losing to Brazil for the first time in their history. Chile were also wooden spooners in the 2014 CONSUR Cup, the new competition featuring Argentina and the top 2 sides in South America. However, the following year, Chile won the South American Championship for the first time in their history, cruising through both Brazil and Paraguay before defeating Uruguay at home 30–15.\nIn 2016, Chile participated in the first Americas Rugby Championship in its current format. Chile squeaked a home win versus Brazil, before playing a close game against Argentina before tiring out in the last 20 minutes, ultimately losing 52–15. Chile were blown out by the United States in Fort Lauderdale 64–0 before nearly beating Uruguay, losing 20–23. Chile lost their last game at home versus Canada, 64–13, finishing bottom in the inaugural edition.\nIn the 2017 Americas Rugby Championship, Chile was defeated in all five matches, scoring just four tries in the tournament. In the 2017 Cup of Nations, the team claimed a win over Kenya, while losing to Russia and Hong Kong.\nGoing into the 2020s Chile finally looked to have turned a corner after having successfully come through the first rounds of South America qualification for the 2023 RWC, they went into the Americas 2 Repechage with strong chances of upsetting a weakened Canada side. In a 2 legged play-off Chile held Canada to a tight 22-21 opener at Langford, British Columbia before overcoming 33-24 in Valparaiso, winning 54-46 on aggregate and booking their place in the Americas 2 qualifier v the USA. It was also their first ever win over Canada at the 8th attempt and one of their biggest scalps yet.\nIn July 2022 Chile qualified for the Rugby World Cup for the first time. They secured their place with an aggregate 52–51 win over the United States, overturning a one-point deficit in the first leg with a 31–29 win in Glendale, Colorado.\nRecord.\nOverall record.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by a Chile national XV at test level up until 5 October 2023.\nSouth American Rugby Championship record.\n \nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nOn 14 August, Chile named an initial 30-player squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

The red symbolizes the team's fierce determination, passion, and energy on the rugby field. This bold hue embodies the spirit of Chilean rugby and reflects the team's unwavering commitment to the game. White, serving as the secondary color, represents purity, unity, and sportsmanship, essential values that the team upholds both on and off the field. The tertiary color, blue, adds depth to the palette, symbolizing loyalty, trust, and stability, qualities that are crucial for team cohesion and success in international rugby competitions.\nThe badge of the Chile rugby union national team is a visual representation of the team's identity and heritage. While the specific design may vary, it often incorporates the national colors along with a iconic symbol of Chile, such as the Andean condor, a majestic bird that holds significant cultural importance in Chilean folklore. The badge typically embodies the team's spirit of determination, strength, and unity, capturing the essence of Chilean rugby. It serves as a powerful emblem that unites players and fans alike, instilling a sense of pride and belonging within the rugby community in Chile.\nSponsors.\nThe following companies are the main sponsors of the Chilean team for the 2023 Rugby World Cup.

        "text": "Joseph Winston Scott (born July 28, 1965) is an American college basketball coach who is currently in his second stint as the head coach at Air Force. Scott previously was head coach at Air Force once before, as well as at Princeton and Denver.\nEarly life and education.\nGrowing up on Pelican Island near Toms River, New Jersey, Scott played baseball, basketball and football at Toms River High School East, where he set the school's basketball career scoring record. Scott played at point guard in high school and set a school record for career basketball points with 1,550.\nScott served as captain 1986–87 Princeton Tigers men's basketball team. As a player in the mid-1980s, Scott learned the \"Princeton offense,\" a methodical system that seeks high-percentage shots by passing until the right opportunity rather than a fast-pace offense with more shots. As a result, Scott has frequently instituted a deliberate pace as a coach, often coaching the slowest-paced team in the country.\nIn 1990, Scott earned his J.D. degree at Notre Dame Law School and became a personal injury lawyer at New Jersey law firm Ribis, Graham, &amp; Carter. In 2004, Scott reflected on his legal career: \"If you are not a public defender or a prosecutor, most of the time what you are trying to do is help yourself, and when I was doing what I was doing every day, I sat there and said, ‘Who am I helping?’ It's all about billing hours.\"\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career (1991–2000).\nAfter being an assistant coach at Monmouth University for the 1991–92 season, Scott returned to Princeton as an assistant coach, first under Pete Carril from 1992 to 1996 and Bill Carmody from 1996 to 2000. Scott's time as assistant coach included a 1996 win over defending champion UCLA in the NCAA Tournament and a no. 7 ranking and another second-round NCAA appearance in 1998. The 1998 team earned a No. 5 seed in the NCAA Tournament, the highest ranking ever for an Ivy League school.\nFirst stint at Air Force (2000–2004).\nFrom 2000 to 2004, Scott was head coach at Air Force. Scott accrued a 51–63 record, starting with an 8–21 record but improving each season. In 2003–04, Scott led Air Force to a 22–7 record, Mountain West Conference regular season title, and an at-large NCAA tournament appearance. Scott earned Mountain West Coach of the Year honors and finished fourth in polling for AP Coach of the Year.\nPrinceton (2004–2007).\nScott succeeded John Thompson III as the head coach at Princeton in 2004 and had a 38–45 record through three seasons. The team finished sixth in the Ivy League in 2004–05, his first season, with a 6–8 record, before rebounding to a 10–4 mark good for second place in the conference in 2005–06. Scott Greenman, a senior point guard, became Scott's first and only First-Team All-Ivy player in 2006.\nDenver (2007–2016).\nScott then served as head coach at the University of Denver from 2007 to 2016. During these nine seasons, Denver went 146–132 and had one postseason appearance, in the NIT, in the same year Denver shared the regular season WAC title in its lone season in the conference. On March 11, 2016, Denver fired Scott with two years remaining on his contract. An associate vice chancellor at Denver commented: \"We want to get to the NCAA Tournament in men’s basketball. We looked at what Joe’s team had done over the nine years and decided it was time to make a transition. Postseason success had not occurred.\"\nHoly Cross and Georgia assistant (2016–2020).\nOn May 23, 2016, Scott became an assistant coach at Holy Cross for his second stint working under Bill Carmody, having previously been an assistant under Carmody at Princeton from 1996 to 2000. After two seasons with Holy Cross, Scott was hired by Tom Crean to be an assistant at the University of Georgia.\nSecond stint at Air Force (2020–present).\nOn March 31, 2020, Scott returned to Air Force for his second stint as head coach.\nPersonal life.\nScott's wife, Leah Spraragen, is a 1992 Princeton graduate who played at point guard for Princeton Tigers women's basketball. They have two children."

        "text": "Thomas Henry Bond (April 2, 1856 – January 24, 1941) was an Irish-born Major League Baseball player who was a pitcher and a right fielder for a total of ten seasons. A native of Granard, Ireland, he is the first man born in Ireland to play Major League Baseball. Bond was also the last survivor of the National League's first season (1876).\nEarly life.\nTommy Bond was born on April 2, 1856, in Granard, Ireland, to an English father and Irish mother. The family migrated to Brooklyn, New York, in 1862, and Tommy played amateur and semiprofessional baseball there in the early 1870s.\nCareer.\nBond played for six teams during his career: the Brooklyn Atlantics (1874), Hartford Dark Blues (1875–1876), Boston Red Caps (1877–1881), Worcester Ruby Legs (1882), Boston Reds (1884), and Indianapolis Hoosiers (1884). He also managed the Worcester team for six games.\nOn October 20 of his rookie year, he fell one out short of what would have been major league baseball's first no-hitter. Two years later, he was the losing pitcher in the first successful no-hitter, hurled by George Bradley on July 15, 1876.\nDuring his 10-season career, he was a three-time 40-game winner, played for two National League pennant-winning clubs, and regularly finished in the top ten in many pitching categories. In 1877, he was the first winner of baseball's pitching Triple Crown, leading the NL in wins (40), earned run average (2.11), and strikeouts (170). His career statistics include a record of 234–163, 386 complete games in 408 starts, 42 shutouts, and an ERA of 2.31. Bond also played 92 games in the outfield, a few more in the infield, and batted .238 with 174 RBI and 213 runs scored. Bond currently holds the third-best strikeouts per walks rate in baseball history, at a 5.0363 ratio, for pitchers who threw a minimum 1,000 innings. Bond previously held the record for over 130 years, and as of 2018 still holds the record for retired pitchers.\nBond threw a fastball, curveball, and by the end of his career a spitball.\nLater life and death.\nBond married his wife, Louise, in 1879, and they had three children.\nAfter retirement from pro baseball, Bond worked stints as an umpire in the National League, minor leagues, and college games. He also worked in his wife's family leather business and then for the city of Boston for decades.\nBond received a single Hall of Fame vote from the Veterans Committee's 1936 ballot.\nBond died the age of 84 in 1941 in Boston, Massachusetts, and is interred at Forest Hills Cemetery.\nHonors.\nIn the Irish Baseball League, the annual award for the best pitcher is named \"The 'Tommy Bond' Best Pitcher Award.\""

        "title": "Experimental Skeleton",
        "text": "The Experimental Skeleton is a non-profit artistic organization in Tampa, Florida that promotes visual arts throughout the area.\nHistory.\nDuring the last 15 years there have been several attempts to revitalize downtown Tampa. Many of them have focused on areas where local artists and artist groups had already gained a foothold and began to build their own communities. These flowering locations, such as Ybor City, simultaneously became attractive to developers. The end result for most of the growing art community was to be pushed out by the hikes in rent and real estate.\nIn 1996, The Florida Center for Contemporary Art (FCCA), a not-for-profit organization that once called Ybor City its home was struggling to reinvent itself in Downtown Tampa. The FCCA began by renting a space on the far north side of Franklin St. where it floundered under the debt it had inherited trying to survive in its Ybor City location. At this time a developer offered up free space at the old Crown Wig Shop further south on Franklin St., and the FCCA took the offer with new hopes of reinvigorating it’s vitality in the arts community. At this point in time The FCCA also joined forces with the artist group Titanic Anatomy, Inc. The Titanic Anatomy group took control of the second level of the space and looked after the F.C.C.A.’s exhibition needs. The partnership yielded a year of energetic projects that made a lasting impact on the arts community.\nThe programming at times linked with Tampa Theater to connect visual projects with film openings. At the end of 1998 the tide again turned, and a project to revitalize the Franklin Street Mall became a hot topic. The plans to create a “farmers market” and “art flea market” from old buildings such as the Woolworth's building caused enough of a stir that developers pulled the plug on the arts organizations’ squatting techniques in hopes of high dollar rental.\nThe efforts to breathe life into Franklin St. failed and buildings such as the Crown Wig Shop remained derelict for seven years and remain so today. The FCCA did not pursue a new venue. Titanic Anatomy, Inc. splintered off into a new group with a different mission called Experimental Skeleton, Inc. Experimental Skeleton was to have many small venues finally landing proper in Seminole Heights where Florida Ave. was quickly becoming the breeding ground for galleries, artist studios, and transplants from the old Ybor City days now making it happen again (notably places like Viva la Frida’ restaurant/gallery). Experimental Skeleton along with other arts organizations like Covivant Gallery continued to function and enrich the city and Seminole Heights neighborhood.\nActivism.\nExperimental Skeleton has a very strong activist nature. The group has weighed in on public/civic projects like gun buy back programs and was instrumental in creating the competition to create a bat house in Al Lopez Park to replace the homes of displaced bats from the old Tampa Stadium. In early 2004 Experimental Skeleton began to engage the city of Tampa in discussions on the city’s initiatives to create a \"City of the Arts.\" The end result of the negotiations with the city and its cultural liaisons was that Experimental Skeleton would be given a space for programming exhibitions, projects and performances. This space, named Flight 19, would reside in the baggage claim building connected to the Union Station at 601 Nebraska Ave.\nThe vision of Flight 19 is to offer an exhibition space to serve the Tampa Bay community by promoting local art and arts organizations as well as programming important national and international art and projects. The programming will also be biased toward experimental art in keeping with the Experimental Skeleton mission. By employing these strategies the hope is that the space will organically grow into an arts “think tank” and a nucleus for creative energies in the downtown area. There will always be something exciting to see at the Flight 19 space. We will not restrict ourselves to the normal exhibition patterns or to any one discipline. We plan to show visual art, live music, performance, one night projects, lectures and even hold workshops on new/ innovative materials for students and artists. The Flight 19 space also will align itself with the city of Tampa in achieving some of its initiatives such as “Lights on Tampa”. We will actively pursue temporary or permanent public works to be sited in downtown Tampa and if possible at the Flight 19 space for public viewing."

        "text": "The 2001 Little League World Series took place between August 17 and August 26 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The Kitasuna Little League of Tokyo, Japan, defeated Apopka National Little League of Apopka, Florida, in the championship game of the 55th Little League World Series. This tournament saw the expansion of pool play to 16 teams, eight from the United States, and eight from around the world. This was the first LLWS to use Little League Volunteer Stadium; it was built to accommodate games added to the pool stage and to host the tournament's consolation game for third place.\nAge controversy.\nFollowing the conclusion of the tournament, Danny Almonte, a pitcher from the Bronx, New York, team representing the Mid-Atlantic Region, was the center of a scandal when it was discovered that he was not eligible to play in the tournament because he was two years over the maximum age limit. Because of this, the Mid-Atlantic team was retroactively assessed a forfeit for each game they won in the tournament. The team's statistics, including a perfect game thrown by Almonte, were also invalidated.\nQualification.\nBetween five and twelve teams take part in 16 regional qualification tournaments, which vary in format depending on region. In the United States, the qualification tournaments are in the same format as the Little League World Series itself: a round-robin tournament followed by an elimination round to determine the regional champion.\nPool play.\nThe top two teams in each pool moved on to the elimination round.\nUnited States.\n Bronx, New York, won all three of their pool games, but were&lt;br&gt;later assessed forfeits due to their use of an ineligible player.&lt;br&gt;\n Bainbridge Island, Washington, was retroactively placed second&lt;br&gt;in Pool B due to the Bronx forfeits.\nInternational.\n† Game ended by \"mercy rule\" (at least 10-run difference through 5 innings)\nElimination rounds.\nThe 2001 Little League World Series was the first edition that had a female umpire call the championship game: Flora Stansbury from Seneca, Missouri. U.S. President George W. Bush, himself a little leaguer as a child, was also in attendance at the championship game. Nobuhisa Baba's single in the bottom of the sixth drove in the winning run.\nChampions' path.\nThe Kitasuna LL reached the LLWS with an undefeated record of four wins and no losses. In total, their record was 9–1, their only loss coming in the LLWS qualifying round against Santiago de Veraguas LL of Panama."

        "title": "Swinging gate (American football)",
        "text": "The Swinging Gate, sometimes referred to as the muddle huddle, is an unorthodox set-piece play in American football, executed in either the offensive or special-teams sections of play. It is unusual in that the offensive line, with the exception of the center, will line up to one side of the field, leaving the quarterback and running back unprotected on the other. Its goal is to disconcert a defensive front in order to allow a quick screen pass to a wide receiver with six blockers, or to allow a short run by the running back. Surprise is the main goal of the play, and it is not typically run outside of short-yardage situations.\nThe play, originally formulated in the 1930s, still retains a modicum of popularity on high school and college teams, where the lesser athleticism of the players will allow the play to be performed with a greater degree of success. An example of the play can be found in the closing scenes of Adam Sandler's remake of the movie \"The Longest Yard\", where Sandler's team executes the play successfully.\nOffensive.\nThe offensive form of the play is rarely run, for the reasons above. However, it does offer several advantages to coaches willing to run it. With five eligible receivers, there are a multitude of targets for the quarterback, though he must get the ball off quickly, before the defense can recover from the initial (presumed) surprise at the unorthodox formation. The receiver at the far left will have six blockers, a crucial advantage for longer situations.\nA rushing attack with the formation tends to be useful only in short-yardage situations, as the lack of blockers for the running back will hamper any longer runs. The formation is typically used as a setup for a pass when not used on special teams.\nSpecial teams.\nThe other, more common, use of the Swinging Gate formation is on special teams, as the offensive team attempts a two-point conversion. The unusual formation allows several different attacks, one of which is a rushing attack, which, thanks to the short yardage needed, is practical in a way that is not on an ordinary play using this formation. If in a situation where the coach finds that his team does not absolutely require a successful two-point conversion, he may give his quarterback permission to call an audible and turn the play into a field goal attempt. In this \"slide,\" the players on the line move back to the center, the quarterback becomes the holder for a place kick, and the halfback becomes the kicker.\nSome teams initially line up in the formation for every or nearly every extra-point attempt before shifting back into a conventional placekicking formation. The reasons for doing this are (1) to attempt to catch the opposing team off guard and only then try a pass or run for two points and (2) to prevent the opposing team from blocking the PAT kick. If the opposing team lines up properly to defend against a run or pass from this formation, the team will not have enough time for its players to get into position to block a kick once the offense has shifted back into a conventional placekicking formation.\nThis formation was utilized extensively on point-after-attempts at Southern Methodist University (SMU) during head coach Phil Bennett's tenure from 2002–2007. It was also used extensively on point-after-attempts at University of Oregon during head coach Chip Kelly's tenure from 2009-2012.\nExamples in NFL.\nIt is not often found in the NFL, due to the danger of a quarterback injury. In a Wild Card playoff game on January 6, 2008, against the San Diego Chargers, the Tennessee Titans lined up in the Swinging Gate formation on their first play from scrimmage. Tennessee quarterback Vince Young threw an incomplete pass on the play. In a December 21, 2009, game between the Washington Redskins and the New York Giants, the Redskins attempted this play with Hunter Smith, the punter, at quarterback, which resulted in an interception.\nDuring an October 18, 2015, game between the New England Patriots and the Indianapolis Colts, in a widely ridiculed playcall, the Colts lined up in a swinging gate formation that resulted in a botched play and a turnover on downs.\nA different version of the swinging gate was used by the Cincinnati Bengals during their 2015 season, nicknamed the \"Star Wars formation\" and shifting only two blockers to the side of the formation instead of four.\nOn January 22, 2023, during the divisional round of the playoffs, with 5 seconds left, the Dallas Cowboys lined up in a swinging gate formation against the San Francisco 49ers. Dak Prescott passed to KaVontae Turpin, who was tackled by Jimmie Ward, ending the game."

        "text": "Andrew Mark Miller (born May 21, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Detroit Tigers, Florida Marlins, Boston Red Sox, Baltimore Orioles, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, and St. Louis Cardinals. Primarily a starting pitcher who struggled early in his MLB career, Miller found sustained success as a reliever utilizing a multi-faceted fastball and slider approach that proved deceptive for batters to hit. A left-handed batter and thrower, Miller stands tall and weighs .\nInstrumental in the Indians' World Series run in 2016, Miller earned the American League (AL) Championship series Most Valuable Player (ALCS MVP) honors, while setting a number of postseason strikeout records for relievers and covering multiple relief roles and innings. He is also a two-time MLB All-Star selection, and a winner of the AL Reliever of the Year Award. In 2017, he earned his first major championship in the World Baseball Classic as a member of the United States national team. His collegiate baseball awards include the \"Baseball America\" College Player of the Year and Roger Clemens Awards.\nA native of Gainesville, Florida, Miller attended the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, playing for the UNC Tar Heels. The Detroit Tigers selected him sixth overall in the 2006 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut that same season after three minor league appearances. After commencing his career in MLB with a 5.70 earned run average (ERA) over 66 starts with Detroit and Florida, he converted to full-time relief in 2012 with Boston, and remained in middle relief, setup and closer roles. The Red Sox traded Miller to the Orioles in 2014, and Miller signed as a free agent with the Yankees after the season. The Yankees traded Miller to the Indians during the 2016 season, and in 2019 he signed with the Cardinals. He pitched in the playoffs in seven consecutive seasons, with Baltimore, the New York Yankees, Cleveland and St. Louis.\nEarly life.\nAndrew Mark Miller was born to David Miller, an accountant and real estate developer, and Kim Miller, a pediatric nurse practitioner, in Gainesville, Florida. His uncle, Dan Miller, is a former NFL and USFL placekicker who played college football at the University of Miami.\nMiller pitched for, and graduated from, Buchholz High School in Gainesville.

On May 16, he struck out a season-best 11 batters while allowing three hits in eight shutout innings against then No. 2 Miami. His first career complete game was on May 28 against Duke in the ACC tournament, in which he gave up two runs and struck out seven.\nIn 15 starts and three relief appearances in 2004, Miller finished with a 6–3 win–loss record (W−L), 2.93 earned run average (ERA), 88 strikeouts in 89 innings, and a .202 batting average against (BAA). He led the ACC in batting average against, and was third in the conference in ERA and fifth with 8.90 strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (K/9). He led Tar Heel starters in ERA and led the club in strikeouts. He was named second-team All-ACC honors and to the \"Baseball America\"'s All-Freshman second team.\nMiller won his first seven decisions of 2005 while giving up three earned runs in his first seven starts. In his first three starts, all victories over Appalachian State, UNC Wilmington and Birmingham–Southern, he allowed only one earned run. He was selected as ACC Pitcher of the Week on February 28 and March 21. Miller struck out a career-high 12 batters in a no-decision against Arizona State on March 4. On two occasions, he carried no-hitters into the sixth inning, once each against Birmingham–Southern and Clemson. He tied an NCAA division I record by hitting seven batters against Virginia on April 1. Miller pitched in tournament losses both to Wake Forest at the ACC tournament and to Florida in the NCAA Regional in his hometown of Gainesville.\nIn 16 starts, Miller totaled innings and posted an 8–4 record, 2.98 ERA, 104 strikeouts, .230 BAA, 9.68 K/9, 52 bases on balls and 19 hit batters.

He reached double-figure strikeouts totals in wins over George Washington on February 26 (11 strikeouts) and Purdue on March 5 (10 strikeouts). He struck out a career-high 13 batters in seven shutout innings versus the then No. 4 Georgia Tech on March 24, and earned ACC Pitcher of the Week honors for that week ending March 27. On March 31, he held No. 1 Florida State scoreless on four hits over seven innings, striking out nine. He was named ACC Pitcher of the Week for the second consecutive week on April 3.\nIn his win over Boston College on May 18, Miller gave up two hits over eight innings to become Carolina's first 11-game winner since 1995. He also struck out 11 Eagle batters to set the school career strikeout record and earned ACC Pitcher of the Week honors on May 22 for the third time of the season. In six regular starts against nationally ranked opponents, he was 5–1 with a 1.27 ERA. Miller was credited with an 8–1 W–L and 1.94 ERA in ACC regular season competition.\nAppearing in his first College World Series tournament, Miller made his first tournament start against No. 2 Cal State Fullerton and struck out nine in innings in a no-decision. His first career save was in the Tar Heels' second victory over the Titans. Miller achieved his first career postseason win after allowing four runs with six strikeouts in eight innings versus Winthrop on June 3. In the Tuscaloosa Super Regional victory on June 9 over No. 4 Alabama, he struck out 11, walked one, and allowed five hits and two unearned runs over seven innings.\nThe Tar Heels were runners-up to Oregon State for the three-game College World Series championship. Miller started Game 1, and allowed three runs and struck out five in five innings. In the final game of the three-game series, Miller relieved future Boston Red Sox teammate Daniel Bard with three runners on base, including the go-ahead and series-deciding run in Bill Rowe on third base. Miller induced the first batter he faced, pinch hitter Ryan Gipson, to hit a ground ball. Second baseman Bryan Steed fielded and threw wide of first baseman Tim Federowicz, allowing Rowe to score and giving Oregon State the title.\nIn his junior year in 2006, Miller allowed 12 extra base hits, while producing a 13−2 W−L with a 2.48 ERA, 133 strikeouts and a .222 BAA in innings. He became the first Tar Heel to win 13 games since 1978. In five games, he struck out at least 10 batters.\nA number of awards followed Miller's accomplishments in 2006, including \"Baseball America\"'s College Player of the Year and the Roger Clemens Award winner as the nation's top collegiate pitcher. The ACC selected him as conference Pitcher of the Year. He was chosen to be on the rosters of All-America first teams by Collegiate Baseball, \"Baseball America\", NCBWA and Rivals.com. Further, Miller was selected as a finalist in 2006 for the Golden Spikes Award by USA Baseball, won by Tim Lincecum.\nCareer accomplishments and honors.\nMiller set Carolina strikeout records for both single season (133 in 2006) and career (325). He also ranked third in Tar Heels' history with 27 wins and fourth in total innings pitched with 309. He reached double-figures in strikeouts in nine games in his career.\nOn January 30, 2016, UNC commemorated Miller's accomplishments during the half-time of a men's basketball game versus Boston College and retired his uniform number 33. He became the third Tar Heel baseball alumnus thusly recognized, following Dave Lemonds and B. J. Surhoff.\nChatham A's.\nIn the summers of 2004 and 2005, Miller pitched for the Chatham A's in the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL). In a July 2004 game versus the Falmouth Commodores called by fog after four innings, he struck out 12 batters, including future Red Sox teammate Jacoby Ellsbury. With Miller's slider hitting the back foot of several hitters as they swung at strike three and missed, controversy arose as to whether they had been officially hit by the pitch or were out on strikes. However, the game's achievements were not counted as five innings would have had to have been completed for the game to be entered as an official record. Named to the CCBL All-Star Game that summer, Miller pitched one inning and struck out all three batters he faced. His season totals included 48 strikeouts in 40 innings, 2–0 W–L and a 2.03 ERA. \"Baseball America\" named him the league's number one Major League prospect.\nIn 2005, Miller posted a 1.65 ERA. \"Baseball America\" rated him the College Summer Player of the Year and the number one prospect in the CCBL in 2005. That year, he also won the Robert A. McNeece Award (outstanding professional prospect) and was a co-winner with Tim Norton of Falmouth and Uconn for the B.F.C. Whitehouse Outstanding Pitcher Award.\nOverall with the A's, Miller won eight games without being defeated and struck out 114 batters in 89 innings. Once the compulsory five-year waiting period concluded, Miller was elected to the CCBL Hall of Fame in 2012. Former Chatham general manager Charlie Thoms presented him for enshrinement on November 10, 2012, at the Chatham Bars Inn.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nAlthough Miller was considered a possible first overall selection in the 2006 MLB draft, the Kansas City Royals instead took Luke Hochevar, and the Detroit Tigers chose Miller sixth overall. They agreed to a contract with a guaranteed value of $5.45 million and a signing bonus of $3.55 million on August 4, 2006. He made his professional debut on August 20, 2006, with the Lakeland Tigers of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. His stint with Lakeland lasted less than a week, as he pitched his third and final outing six days later. After five scoreless innings with nine strikeouts, Detroit called him up to the major leagues.\nDetroit Tigers.\nMiller made his MLB debut on August 30, 2006, at Yankee Stadium against the New York Yankees, pitching one scoreless inning and allowing one baserunner, Craig Wilson, on a hit by pitch. In eight games, Miller posted a 0–1 record with a 6.10 ERA, walking ten batters in innings, including seven of 16 left-handers faced. The Tigers advanced to the playoffs and did not include him on the roster. They lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2006 World Series. \"Baseball America\" rated Miller's slider as the best in the Tigers organization and the franchise's second-best prospect overall.\nWhile Miller did not make the Tigers' opening day roster in 2007, he made his first major league start May 18, 2007, versus the Cardinals. Starting in place of the injured Jeremy Bonderman, he completed six scoreless innings with four hits, three walks and two strikeouts, earning his first major league victory. Detroit optioned him back to the minors four days later with Bonderman recovered from injury. Miller played for Lakeland and the Erie SeaWolves of the Class AA Eastern League. With the SeaWolves, he started three games in May and yielded a 0.78 ERA in 23 IP.\nThe Tigers recalled Miller on June 10 when they sent Nate Robertson to the disabled list (DL) with arm fatigue, and Miller started that day. He was the winning pitcher by decision in a 15–7 victory over the New York Mets. His best game pitched of 2007 was a six-inning performance in Atlanta on June 24, allowing four hits and no runs while also striking out two batters and walking two ending in a 5–0 Tigers victory. In July, he compiled a 2–1 record, 3.71 ERA and 28 strikeouts over five starts and IP, and was fifth in the American League with 9.45 K/9. He went on the DL on August 3 and was reinstated on August 24, as he produced a 0–1 record and 19.80 ERA, allowing 11 ER in five IP in two starts before being optioned to Lakeland on August 30. In 13 starts in 2007, Miller was credited with a 5–5 record and 5.63 ERA. He limited left-handed batters (LHB) to a .175 batting average, and right-handers (RHB) batted .312 against him, the ninth-highest average against in the American League.\nFlorida Marlins.\nOn December 5, 2007, the Tigers traded Andrew, Cameron Maybin, Mike Rabelo, Dallas Trahern, Eulogio de la Cruz and Burke Badenhop to the Florida Marlins for Dontrelle Willis and Miguel Cabrera. Miller started the season in the Marlins rotation. From April 23 to May 10, he established a new personal-best three game winning streak. In the month of May, he made five starts, going 3–2 with a 2.43 ERA. He made 20 starts through July 18 until landing on 15-day disabled list on July 18 with patellar tendinitis in the right knee. Through that point, he had posted a 5–9 record and 5.63 ERA in innings.\nAndrew played in six rehab games, going 1–1 with 2.33 ERA, before reinstatement from the DL on September 1, 2008. The Marlins moved him to the bullpen, and he went 1–1 with a 9.45 ERA in nine appearances and innings. From June 22 to September 9, he lost four consecutive decisions, matching his personal high. Reaching new career-highs for a season, Miller appeared in 29 games, starting 20, and went 6–10 W–L with a 5.87 ERA and 89 strikeouts in innings. He allowed a .226 average (21 hits in 93 at-bats) and three home runs to LHB, and a .321 average (99-for-322) and four home runs to RHB.\nThe Marlins initially assigned Miller to the bullpen in 2009 before inserting him into the starting rotation on April 15. He injured his oblique muscle on April 20. The club placed him on the disabled list and reactivated him on May 16. He completed a season-high seven innings and tied a career-best with nine strikeouts versus the Arizona Diamondbacks on May 21. Florida optioned him to the New Orleans Zephyrs on July 20, where he was 1–2 with a 5.79 ERA in 18.2 IP in five starts at the minor league level. He rolled his ankle during July 29 start at Nashville. He was recalled to the major leagues on September 6. He made 20 appearances in 2009, with 14 of them starts, going 3–5 with a 4.84 ERA.\nDuring spring training in 2010, the Marlins announced that they would assign Miller to their Triple-A minor league team, New Orleans to open the season. He also pitched for the Double-A Jacksonville Suns, where he made 18 starts and completed innings. His record was 1–8 record and ERA 6.01 as he allowed 57 earned runs and 61 walks with 66 strikeouts. The club recalled him to the major leagues on August 18. Miller finished the 2010 year 1–5 with an 8.54 ERA in nine games and seven starts.\nBoston Red Sox.\n2011–2012.\nOn November 12, 2010, the Marlins traded Miller to the Boston Red Sox for relief pitcher Dustin Richardson. Boston non-tendered him less than a month later. Manager Terry Francona estimated that he \"must have made 15 calls that winter trying to get him to come to the Red Sox\" after the club non-tendered him because he saw that flaws in his pitching mechanics could be easily corrected. Miller re-signed with Boston on December 16, 2010. During 2011 spring training, Boston optioned Miller to minor league camp and announced that he would begin the year as a starting pitcher with the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox.\nOn June 19, 2011, Boston purchased Miller's contract. The Red Sox won the first four games that he started, while he was credited as the winning pitcher in three of them. His first loss of the 2011 season came on July 15, as the Tampa Bay Rays hosted the Red Sox at Tropicana Field. Miller was pulled after innings, having already given up seven runs on five hits, including a grand slam to Ben Zobrist. He finished the 2011 year 6–3 with a 5.54 ERA in 17 games and 12 starts.\nMiller began the 2012 season in the minors while recovering from an injury. When he was called up to the majors, the Red Sox moved him to the bullpen, which became permanent after having posted a 5.70 ERA in 66 career starts. Miller limited left-handed batters (LHB) to a .149 average (13-for-87) in 2012, the second-lowest in the AL for all pitchers with a minimum of 100 batters faced, and the lowest average by a Red Sox left-handed pitcher since at least 1974. He allowed one extra-base hit to LHB over the season, on May 23, and afterward allowed 10 more hits to LHB. Of 46 runners inherited, he stranded 39 (84.8 percent), the fifth best in the AL, and the eighth-best ratio of Red Sox relievers since at least 1974 who had inherited 30 or more runners. He recorded a team-high 31 hitless appearances and produced 22 perfect outings.\nMiller's 2012 totals included a 3–2 record and a 3.35 ERA in 53 appearances. His totals in games, ERA, holds (13), WHIP (1.19), opponent AVG (.194), walks per 9.0 innings (4.46), and K/9 (11.38) were all career-bests. The Boston BBWAA named Miller Red Sox Fireman of the Year in his first full season of relief pitching.\n2013–2014.\nIn a July 6, 2013, game against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Miller tripped and suffered a foot injury by while covering home plate after J. B. Shuck had hit a single. Podiatrist Dr. George Theodore found torn ligaments in the Lisfranc zone of his foot. As a result, Miller missed the remainder of the 2013 season. He had accumulated a 1–2 W–L with a 2.64 ERA and 48 strikeouts over innings in 37 games. He averaged a career-best 2.82 strikeout-to-walk ratio (K/BB) and career-high 14.1 K/9, the second-highest ratio for all MLB relievers with at least 30 IP. Despite his year-ending absence, the Red Sox awarded Miller a championship ring after winning the World Series.\nMiller reached new levels of success in 2014 with Boston. He was especially effective at home at Fenway Park, stranding 24 of 26 inherited runners (92.3%) and allowing one run in 26 games for a 0.39 ERA in 23 IP while limiting opponents to a .105 batting average and career-low .229 on-base percentage. His season totals with the Red Sox included 50 appearances with a 3–5 W–L, 2.34 ERA, 13 walks and 69 strikeouts in innings.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn July 31, 2014, Boston traded Miller to the Baltimore Orioles for minor-league pitcher Eduardo Rodríguez. On September 7, 2014, Miller completed a scoreless 11th in a 7−5 victory over Tampa Bay for his first career save. The Orioles clinched their first American League East title in 17 years on September 16, 2014, in an 8−2 win over Toronto. He faced two batters in that game and struck both out.\nAccording to \"Brooks Baseball\", opponents batted .071 against Miller's slider in 2014, and .153 against him overall. In 23 appearances with Baltimore, Miller finished 2–0 with a 1.35 ERA. With both Boston and Baltimore in 2014, Miller made 73 appearances going 5–5 with a 2.02 ERA and 103 strikeouts. During the Orioles' American League Division Series (ALDS) sweep of the Detroit Tigers, Miller earned a hold in two of the Oriole victories. He pitched a total of innings of no-hit and no-run baseball while striking out three Tigers batters and retired 22 of 24 batters faced in seven scoreless innings overall in the 2014 playoffs.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn December 5, 2014, Miller reached an agreement on a contract with the New York Yankees lasting four years and worth $36 million. Before the season started, Yankees manager Joe Girardi announced that Miller and Dellin Betances would split the closing job. Both men had one career save entering the season. Miller began the season with scoreless innings, recording his first save in a Yankee uniform on April 8, 2015. On April 27, he became the first Yankee player to record eight saves in a 20-game span.\nAccording to \"Brooks Baseball\", opponents batted .092 against Miller's slider in 2015. Miller finished the season with a 2.04 ERA, 36 saves, and 100 strikeouts in innings pitched. Of all MLB pitchers, he held right-handed batters to the lowest batting average, .130 (in 30 or more innings). He won the 2015 American League Relief Pitcher of the Year Award, the Rollie Fingers American League Relief Pitcher of the Year as voted by the Internet Baseball Writers' Association of America, and was recognized at the 2016 Thurman Munson Awards as the Yankees' \"premier closer\" for 2015. In the AL Cy Young Award voting, Miller placed tenth.\nPrior to the 2016 season, the Yankees informed Miller that he would serve as the eighth-inning setup man with the acquisition of Aroldis Chapman, considered one of baseball's top closers. However, early in spring training, MLB suspended Chapman for 30 games to commence with the start of the upcoming regular season, and the Yankees temporarily reinstalled Miller as closer. At the end of spring training, a line drive fractured the pisiform bone in his right hand. He decided to pitch with the fracture, stating that \"according to Wikipedia, it's not really an important bone. It doesn't really do anything.\"\nUntil Chapman's return, Miller saved nine games. While with the Yankees, the triumvirate of Betances, Chapman and Miller were known by fans as \"No Runs–D.M.C.,\" owing to the relievers' dominance of opposing hitters. Miller was selected to his first All-Star Game, played at Petco Park in San Diego. He pitched two-thirds of an inning and was removed after loading the bases, but no runs were charged to him. Before the midseason trade, Miller recorded 77 strikeouts in innings while posting an ERA of 1.39 in 44 games for the Yankees.\nCleveland Indians.\n2016.\nOn July 31, 2016, the Yankees traded Miller to the Cleveland Indians for Clint Frazier, Justus Sheffield, Ben Heller and J. P. Feyereisen. Miller's first save for Cleveland was in a 5−2 victory over New York at Yankee Stadium on August 6, 2016. He became the first pitcher to earn a save for and against the Yankees in the same season since 1988.\nFrancona, now reunited with Miller as the Indians' manager, commented that he saw \"a guy that is willing to pitch any inning.\" He deployed Miller in every inning from the fifth into extra innings, \"in the highest stress situations,\" appearing before the eighth inning in nine of 26 games. With Cleveland, Miller completed 29 innings, allowed two walks, and struck out 46, posting a 1.55 ERA. His aggregate 2016 regular season included 12 saves, a 10−1 record, 1.45 ERA, 0.68 walks plus hits per inning pitched (WHIP), 123 strikeouts and nine walks. He became the first major leaguer in history to record 120 or more strikeouts in a season while allowing fewer than ten walks. According to \"Brooks Baseball\", opponents batted .159 against Miller's slider in 2016. He placed ninth in the AL Cy Young Award balloting, receiving one third place vote.\nThe Indians swept Boston in the ALDS and Miller completed four innings in two appearances, permitting two hits, walking two and striking out seven. He played in two innings each of Games 1 and 2 in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) against the Toronto Blue Jays, striking out ten of 12 batters faced. After striking out Kevin Pillar in the seventh inning of Game 2, he matched Phil Coke in the 2012 World Series as the only pitchers to strike out at least five consecutive batters in the postseason. Miller also became the first pitcher in major league history to strike out at least five batters each on consecutive days. Covering his first four appearances in the 2016 postseason, he struck out 17 in innings.\nMiller recorded the final four outs of Game 3, striking out three in a 4−2 win, for his first career postseason save. In Game 5, he completed innings as the Indians won the ALCS. He was named ALCS Most Valuable Player (MVP), having completed scoreless innings, allowing three hits, no walks and striking out 14. His strikeout total set an ALCS record for relievers. He also was credited with three holds and one save. At that point, he had completed 20 scoreless innings to begin his playoff career.\nIn Game 3 of the World Series against the Chicago Cubs, Miller was credited with his first World Series win in a 1–0 victory. After striking out three of four batters faced in innings, he reached 15 consecutive scoreless innings in the 2016 playoffs, surpassing Mariano Rivera and Goose Gossage to set the record for relief pitchers in a single postseason. In Game 4, he struck out two Cubs hitters, bringing his 2016 playoff total to 29, and surpassing Francisco Rodríguez' total of 28 in the 2002 postseason for the all-time record among relievers in a postseason. Another strikeout record Miller set was to strike out at least three batters each in seven different appearances, all in the 2016 postseason, and more than other MLB reliever. Dexter Fowler homered off Miller in Game 4, ending his scoreless streak at 17 innings in the 2016 playoffs and to commence his postseason career. In Game 7, Miller allowed five batters to reach base and two runs to score in innings as the Indians lost the game and Series. Miller's strikeout record for relievers in a single postseason reached 30, and other single-postseason records he set for relievers in 2016 were innings () and multi-inning appearances (10). In spite of finally succumbing in pivotal Game 7 to the Cubs' offense, Miller was named the 2016 Esurance MLB/This Year in Baseball Award winner for Best Postseason Major Leaguer.\n2017.\nIn 2017, Miller was selected to play in the All-Star Game, his second career selection. He struck out Cody Bellinger swinging to end the game and earn his first career All-Star save. On August 2, the Indians placed Miller on the 10-day disabled list due to patellar tendinitis in the right knee. He returned to action on August 21, but left the game after throwing seven pitches. It was soon revealed that he re-aggravated the same knee, and the next day, he was again placed on the 10-day disabled list. The Indians reactivated Miller on September 14, the day they broke the American League record for longest winning streak at 21 games. Miller's season totals included a 4−3 W−L, innings, 1.44 ERA, 95 strikeouts, 31 hits allowed, 21 walks and two saves in 57 appearances. The Indians won an AL-best 102 games.\nMiller absorbed the first loss of his playoff career on October 8, 2017, versus the Yankees, in Game 3 of the ALDS. He allowed a solo home run to Greg Bird, the only run of the game in a 1−0 score. Just one left-handed batter − Bellinger − had previously homered off Miller in 2017. The Yankees defeated the Indians in the ALDS in five games. The home run to Bird was the only run Miller allowed in the series. He made four appearances, completed five innings, and struck out eight.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nOn December 21, 2018, Miller agreed to a two-year, $25 million contract with the St. Louis Cardinals with a vesting option for 2021. Miller finished the 2019 regular season with a 5–6 record and a 4.45 ERA, striking out 70 batters over relief innings. His vesting option was applied for the 2021 season. He finished the 2020 season with a 2.77 ERA with 16 strikeouts in 13.0 innings of work.\nOn March 24, 2022, Miller announced his retirement.\nInternational career.\nAs a participant for the United States national baseball team in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, Miller gave up home runs to Nelson Cruz and Starling Marte of the Dominican Republic in Team USA's first loss of the tournament. Miller earned the first major international championship of his baseball career when Team USA defeated Puerto Rico 8−0 in the final on March 22, 2017.\nPitching style.\nBoth attempting to lead sequences against hitters with the fastball and a myriad of mechanical issues limited Miller's success as a starting pitcher early in his major league career. He also threw a changeup more frequently earlier in his career. His most effective pitch was the slider (83-87 mph); once he began to use that more frequently, he experimented more with varying the output. One variety, with a flat and horizontal break, more closely resembled a fastball than the others by traveling in a more direct path. Another was designed to dart toward the back foot of a right-handed batter.\nSaid former Tigers manager Jim Leyland of Miller's early struggles, \"He was like a lot of guys breaking into the profession and wasn't sure what it was all about. He had a huge arm – big, big stuff — but he found it tough to repeat his delivery. ... He didn't have the command. But I think he's got it right. This game is hard. Success is definitely not a straight line, but are you willing to work?\" Former Boston batterymate David Ross, who observed Miller while he was transitioning from starting to relieving full-time, said, \"A guy like Andrew Miller has perspective on success and failure, so he understands not to take anything for granted and to stay in the moment and continue to do what he does best. That's character.\"\nWith each of the different teams for which he played before converting to relief, Miller experimented with different pitching philosophies. Detroit encouraged him to throw harder while Florida wanted him to throw more changeups and curveballs. He also experimented with the different arm slots. One day while playing bullpen catch with Edward Mujica as teammates in Boston, Mujica suggested that Miller keep his back foot on the rubber as long as possible. This allowed Miller to increase the stability of his feet before pivoting, which aided his mechanics.\nPersonal life.\nAndrew Miller is married to Katie (née Roark) Miller, who is also from Gainesville, Florida, where they met. Roark attended Duke University and was a four-year letter recipient in soccer for the Blue Devils. As of 2014, the Millers resided in Tampa, Florida. They have a son who was born in 2012."

They are distinguished as a group by having made their North American professional baseball debut with a Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise without having previously played at the professional level. After their major-league debuts, many of these players appeared in professional leagues other than MLB. \nIncluded are multiple \"bonus babies\", who joined major-league rosters from 1947 to 1957 and from 1962 to 1965 under the bonus rule, which obligated major-league teams to keep players awarded large signing bonuses on their rosters for two seasons. Excluded are players who, prior to their major-league debut, appeared in any professional baseball game, such as within Minor League Baseball, Negro league baseball, professional leagues outside of North America (such as Nippon Professional Baseball), or independent baseball leagues. A player who participated only in offseason developmental baseball (such as winter league baseball) is not excluded.\nThe practice of players directly joining a major-league team has become increasingly rare since the MLB draft was instituted in 1965—it has only occurred nine times since 1980, and three times since 2000.\nPlayers.\nListed below are baseball players who did not play baseball professionally before their MLB debuts. Each of these players, with the exception of Charlie Faust, Eddie Gaedel, and Herb Washington, first played amateur baseball in an organized sports league, typically at the high school or college level. Faust played two games with the 1911 New York Giants, essentially as a good luck charm under manager John McGraw. Gaedel, who stood , played one game with the 1951 St. Louis Browns, as a gimmick of owner Bill Veeck. Washington, who played for the Oakland Athletics in the mid-1970s, was put under contract by owner Charlie Finley due to his experience as a world-class sprinter."

He has represented Wales at every level from Schools up to the national side, including the Grand Slam-winning Under-21 side of 1999. Jones played at both loosehead and tighthead at school level. During the early part of his professional career with Neath he played at tighthead but switched to loosehead in 2001.\nHe made his first-class debut for Neath RFC in 1999 and played for the club until the end of the 2002–03 season, when, following a reorganisation of Welsh rugby, Jones transferred to what was then the Neath-Swansea Ospreys. He made his debut for the Ospreys on 10 January 2004. However he was soon followed by Adam Jones who made his first appearance for Ospreys on 13 March 2004 against Stade Toulousain.\nIn 2005–06, Duncan Jones took over as captain of the Ospreys, following an injury to Barry Williams, and he was appointed captain for the 2006–07 season, during which he led the team to the Celtic League title.\nInternational career.\nHe made his debut for Wales on 25 November 2001, coming on as a substitute in the Autumn International against . In the 2002 Six Nations Championship, he made two appearances as a substitute, against and .\nJones made his first start for Wales in August 2003, playing in two warm-up matches, against Ireland and . He was selected in the squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup and started in two pool games, against and , but suffered a fractured fibula during the game against Italy and had to return home, being replaced by Ospreys teammate Paul James.\nHe returned from injury in time to start three games in the 2004 Six Nations Championship; he also started in both Tests against and came on as a replacement against on Wales's mid-year tour.\nJones played in the 2004 Autumn Internationals but a dislocated thumb, sustained during a Heineken Cup match between the Ospreys and Munster in January 2005, meant that he was unavailable for the 2005 Six Nations Championship, in which Wales achieved the Grand Slam. He returned to the Welsh team for a two-game tour to the and in June 2005.\nIn 2005–06, Jones started in all but one of Wales's Autumn Internationals (he missed the game against ) and in all their 2006 Six Nations Championship matches, following which he was chosen by new coach Gareth Jenkins to captain the side during a mid-year two-Test tour of Argentina. In October 2006, Jenkins appointed Stephen Jones to captain Wales through to the 2007 Rugby World Cup, but when Stephen Jones was rested for the Autumn International against the Pacific Islanders, Duncan Jones returned to captain Wales at home for the first time. He played, as starter or substitute, in all four Autumn Internationals and all five matches in the 2007 Six Nations Championship, but was rested for the mid-year tour to Australia.\nJones was named in the Welsh squad for the 2007 World Cup, and started in the warm-up games against Argentina and France, but though he played in all four pool games during the tournament, he only started in one game, against . He subsequently featured as a substitute in a one-off Test against new World Champions, South Africa, in November 2007 and started in Wales's first two games in the 2008 Six Nations Championship, against and .\nSkills.\nAlthough \"not the biggest guy\" for a prop, Jones makes up for his perceived lack of size with speed, mobility and ball-handling skills that would not disgrace a back. As well as being a good ball-carrier, he is also solid in the scrum and a hard-working defensive tackler.\nOn the field, Jones is instantly recognisable because of his long curly blond hair. His previous Ospreys and Wales front-row partner Adam Jones is equally recognisable by his shaggy dark hair and the two props were popularly known as the \"Hair Bears\"."

Ketcham was a consensus All-America first-team selection in 1911 and 1912, and a second-team selection in 1913. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1968.\nBiography.\nKetcham was born in Englewood, New Jersey, and lived in Brooklyn, New York, and North Hatley, Quebec, during his youth. His father was a graduate of Yale and a lawyer. After attending the Hotchkiss School, Ketcham enrolled at Yale, where he was a member of Skull and Bones and the Psi Upsilon fraternity.\nKetcham played every game for Yale's varsity football team in 1911, 1912, and 1913. He helped lead Yale to a 7–2–1 record in 1911 and a 7–1–1 record in 1912 and was a consensus All-America Team selection for both of those seasons. In December 1912, Ketcham was selected as captain of the 1913 Yale football team. In a departure from past tradition at Yale, Ketcham subsequently appointed Howard Jones as the school's first salaried football coach.\nKetcham later recalled: \"I played every varsity game for three years and was taken out only once for a slight injury … I am generally credited with having developed the term 'roving center'. Except for today's platoon systems, football hasn't changed materially. We had the on-side kick, the ball was a bit larger in circumference and the drop kick was more popular than the place kick.\"\nAt the time he graduated from Yale, Ketchum expected to work in railroading, having worked during one summer for the Big Four Railroad.\nKetcham served in the United States Army as a lieutenant during World War I, from May 1917 to April 1919. He saw action as a member of the 103rd Field Artillery Regiment in the Battle of Saint-Mihiel and the Meuse–Argonne offensive, being slightly wounded in the latter.\nKetcham moved to Seattle and entered the lumber business, eventually owning a lumber wholesale business. In 1921, he married Katherine Eugenia Peters. Three of their sons went on to found the West Fraser Timber company.\nIn February 1968, Ketcham was selected as an inductee to the College Football Hall of Fame. He died in 1986, aged 95."

He is currently the head coach of the Boston College Eagles, an NCAA Division I team competing in Hockey East. Previously, Brown was a member of the Eagles coaching staff for fourteen years from 2004–2018, serving as an assistant coach under Jerry York and later alongside him as associate head coach. He also coached under David Quinn with the New York Rangers from 2018–2021 and served as the head coach for the Dubuque Fighting Saints for the 2021–22 USHL season.\nPlaying career.\nBrown was drafted in the second round, 26th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. Brown played his prep hockey career at St. Mark's School in Massachusetts before moving on to Boston College, where he played from 1986–1990 and amassed 120 points in 119 games. Brown skipped his sophomore season at B.C. to play for the American national men's hockey team and in the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, where he totaled four points in six games for the seventh place US team. Following his junior and senior seasons at B.C., Brown was named Hockey East player of the year and was a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award, given to the top NCAA men's ice hockey player. He was also named 1990 Athlete of the Year by USA Hockey.\nBrown moved into the professional ranks for the 1990/91 season, splitting time between the Sabres and their AHL affiliate, the Rochester Americans and scoring 26 points in 80 combined games. The 39 games played in Buffalo that season represented a career high, as he would play in only 55 more NHL games over the next three seasons. Most of Brown's time with the Sabres organization was spent in Rochester, where he was part of the team's 1991 and 1993 Calder Cup finalists. Brown left the Americans during the 1992 season to again represent USA Hockey at the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. Brown appeared in seven games for the US team, which finished a surprising fourth after losing to Czechoslovakia in the Bronze Medal game.\nFollowing the 1992–93 season, Brown was released by the Sabres and signed with the San Diego Gulls of the IHL and later with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Brown scored a career-high 11 points in 36 games for the Penguins during the 1993/94 season. Brown was traded to the Winnipeg Jets during the following season, where he appeared in his final nine NHL contests.\nWith the exception of two brief stints with USA Hockey, Brown spent the final six seasons of his pro career in Europe, retiring after the 2002/03 season. His stops in Europe included games with Rogle Angelholm and Leksands IF in the Swedish Elite League, Feldkirch VEU of the Austrian National League, the Kloten Flyers of Nationalliga A in Switzerland, and EV Landshut and the Kölner Haie of Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga.\nCoaching career.\nBoston College.\nFollowing his playing career, Brown returned to Boston College, where he was named as an assistant coach on the men's hockey team for the 2004–05 season.\nNew York Rangers.\nOn July 17, 2018, the New York Rangers announced that Brown would be joining David Quinn as an assistant coach for the team, along with David Oliver.\nDubuque Fighting Saints.\nOn June 28, 2021, Brown was hired for his first head coaching position with the Dubuque Fighting Saints of the junior United States Hockey League (USHL).\nReturn to Boston College.\nBrown was named the head coach of the Boston College Eagles on May 6, 2022.\nPersonal.\nHe is the brother of former NHL winger Doug Brown and uncle of current Boston Bruins player Patrick Brown.\nHe coached his nephews Patrick and Christopher while they attended Boston College from 2010–2014, and 2015–2019, respectively.

        "text": "Eric Stefan Persson (born 22 December 1954) is a Swedish professional ice hockey executive and former player. He is the general manager of Borås HC hockey club in Sweden. Persson played for nine seasons with the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League (NHL), where he was a member of four Stanley Cup championship teams in the early 1980s.\nPlaying career.\nPersson made his playing debut as an 18-year-old defenceman with Piteå IF. In 1973 he joined Brynäs. While with Brynäs, he received his first national championship silver medal and two national championship gold medals, in 1976 and 1977. It was during this time that the New York Islanders drafted him, so Persson decided to go overseas to play in the NHL.\nPersson's responsible, defensive style was endorsed highly by the Islanders head coach, Al Arbour, and Persson's career in the NHL started swiftly. Persson also showed an adept passing ability and an occasional scoring touch. This was no more apparent than during the Islanders first Stanley Cup playoff run in Game 1 of the 1980 Finals against the Philadelphia Flyers. It was late in the third period, when Persson scored the game-tying goal to force a sudden-death overtime that the Islanders won. Outdoing his regular season output of four goals, Persson scored five goals in the 1980 playoffs, and had serious consideration to become the first Swede to capture the Conn Smythe Trophy, which is awarded for MVP of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Persson was part of the first NHL team (1979–80 New York Islanders) to win a Stanley Cup with Europeans on its roster. The Islanders, with Persson as a regular on their backline, won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships (1980, 1981, 1982, 1983). He also set another record with the Islanders, playing more games than any other Swedish player in the NHL at that time.\nDuring nine seasons with the Islanders, including playoffs, Persson played in 724 games, scored 59 goals and had 367 assists. He sent the four diamond rings he received for the four Stanley Cup wins to his father, Gösta, in the northern city of Piteå, where he had begun his hockey career.\nDuring the late stages of the 1985–86 season, the Islanders management, starting to lose the commitment from its owner to its product, decided that it was no longer prudent to pay Persson's salary, so they traded him to the Winnipeg Jets for a player to be named later. Persson had become a part of the community on Long Island, his only U.S. residence, and was so distraught about the trade that he decided, almost immediately, not to report to Winnipeg, and instead retired from the NHL altogether. Instead, he returned to Sweden and joined Sweden's big-league Borås HC, and was later given an administrative position with the team. After that he was asked to become the national junior team's general manager.\nHe was inducted into the Piteå Wall of Fame in 2006."

        "text": "The 1935 Tour de France was the 29th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 4 to 28 July. It consisted of 21 stages over . Although the French team was favourite, Belgian Romain Maes took the lead in the first stage, and never gave it away. Halfway the race, Romain Maes' biggest threat, Antonin Magne, had to abandon after he was hit by a motorist.\nIn the eighth stage, Spanish cyclist Francisco Cepeda fell while he was descending at high speed, and died while he was being transported to the hospital.\nInnovations and changes.\nThis was the first Tour that had a stage finish and start in a city that was not in France, when Geneva was visited in the fifth stage.\nThe prize money increased in 1935, and for the first time it was more than one million Francs.\nTeams.\nAs was the custom since the 1930 Tour de France, the 1935 Tour de France was contested by national teams. Belgium, Italy, Spain, Germany and France each sent teams of 8 cyclists. Each country also sent four cyclists who rode as individuals, but could take over the place of another cyclist if they dropped out. Spain only sent three cyclists, and Switzerland sent four individual cyclists even though they did not have a national team, so 23 individual cyclists were racing. Finally, there was the touriste-routiers category, in which 30 cyclists participated. In total this made 93 cyclists. Split up in nationalities, there were 41 French, 13 Italian, 12 Belgian, 12 German, 11 Spanish and 4 Swiss cyclists.\nThe French team looked very strong, as it contained the three winners of the last five Tours, Antonin Magne, Georges Speicher and André Leducq, in addition to climber René Vietto and Maurice Archambaud, who had led the general classification for a long time in 1933. In addition, they had Roger Lapébie and Charles Pélissier riding as individuals, which meant that they could take the place of a French team member dropping out.\nOf the other teams, the Belgian and Italian teams seemed most likely to challenge the French.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nStages 5, 13, 14, 18, 19 and 20 are retroactively seen as split stages, always between a standard mass-start stage and a time trial stage. In 1935, the mass-start stages were seen as a normal stage, and the time trial stages were not numbered.\nStages 5b, 14b and 18b were individual time trials, while stages 13b, 19b and 20b where team time trials. In the team time trials in 1935, cyclists started together in teams, but unlike current team time trials it was the individual time that counted; the team time trial was not won by a team but by a cyclist.\nThe highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 7.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, Belgian Romain Maes was lucky as he passed a train crossing just before it closed, while the rest had to wait. Romain Maes was one minute ahead, and although he was chased, the others could not capture him. In the second stage, Romain Maes was less lucky, as several flat tires put him nine minutes behind the peloton. The Belgian team chased for 70 km to get him back with the rest. The stage was won by French sprinter Charles Pélissier. Romain Maes and Charles Pélissier were now ranked first and second, but nobody expected them to remain on top of the general classification.\nOn the fourth stage, the French team performed poorly; the first French cyclist came in tenth place, and Romain Maes increased his leading margin to over five minutes. In the second part of the fifth stage, Romain Maes performed unexpectedly well, as he lost only 38 seconds to Magne, a time trial specialist. Magne was in second place in the general classification, about four minutes behind Romain Maes.\nThe sixth stage, the first in the Alps, was perfect for a climber like Vietto, and he indeed took the victory solo. Magne was still about four minutes behind Romain Maes. In the seventh stage, Magne was hit by a motorist, and had to abandon the race. Later in that stage, Spanish cyclist Francisco Cepeda died after he fell going down the Galibier. One of his tires peeled off his rim, causing him to crash at a high speed. Because Magne was out of the race, Vasco Bergamaschi became the new number two of the general classification, more than twelve minutes behind Romain Maes. In the ninth stage, Bergamaschi lost half an hour, and was out of contention for the victory. René Vietto won the stage, with Francesco Camusso a few seconds behind him. Romain Maes lost almost ten minutes, and Camusso jumped to second place in the general classification, three and a half minutes behind Romain Maes.\nIn the tenth, eleventh and twelfth stage, Romain Maes won some time on Camusso. The second part of the thirteenth stage was a team time trial, in which the French team beat the Belgian team by 27 seconds, and put Speicher within 9 minutes of Maes in the general classification. In the second part of the fourteenth stage, however, Romain Maes finished in second place, thereby increasing his lead in the general classification to more than ten minutes on Speicher, who had jumped to second place.\nThe fifteenth stage was fought on the Pyrenees. Belgian cyclists Felicien Vervaecke and Sylvère Maes led and beat the others by minutes. The first three places in the general classification were now all occupied by Belgian cyclists; Romain Maes, Vervaecke and Sylvère Maes.\nIn the sixteenth stage Romain Maes ran into trouble for the first time in 1935. The Belgian team controlled the race over the first three mountains, but on the fourth, the Aubisque, Italians Ambrogio Morelli and Orlando Teani escaped. Morelli won the stage and took the time bonus, and Romain Maes needed his teammates to keep his losses small. Vervaecke and Jules Lowie helped him to keep it to only six minutes, and Romain Maes was still ahead in the general classification, although only two and a half minute ahead of Morelli.\nIn the first half of the eighteenth stage, Morelli lost ten minutes. Jean Aerts crossed the finish line first in that stage, but he was set to second place by the jury because he had sprinted irregularly. Maes finished second in the second part of that stage, and increased his lead even more. Initially Jean Fontenay was declared winner of that stage, but he got a penalty of five minutes after the jury found out he had been helped by a car. Romain Maes finished the Tour by escaping in the last stage, and finishing alone in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nFor the mountains classification, 15 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. On the top of these mountains, ten points were given for the first cyclist to pass, nine points to the second cyclist, and so on, until the tenth cyclist who got one point.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1935 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner.\nIndividuals that ranked higher than team members could be put in the team. This happened with the Belgian team: individual Sylvère Maes ranked higher than the third Belgian team member Jean Aerts, so his time was used for the calculation. If this rule would have not been in place, the French team would have won the team classification. It also happened with the Spanish team, which had only two cyclists left at the end of the race; Spanish individual Vicente Bachero was added to the team. The Italian team had no cyclists left at the end of the race. There were two Italians in the individual category that were then added for the team calculation, but they still lacked a third team member. For that case there was a rule that said that an imaginary cyclist would be added to the team, that had the time of the final cyclist plus one hour penalty time.\nSecond-placed Morelli was the best cyclist who had started in the \"individuals\" category, while ninth-placed Ruozzi became the winner of the \"touriste-routiers\" category. However, in 1935 Morelli was considered to have been included in the Italian team, while Sylvère Maes and Jules Lowie are considered to have been included in the Belgian team, which made Charles Pélissier the best placed individual cyclist.\nAftermath.\nFelicien Vervaecke, who had finished in third place, felt that he could have won this Tour by more than one hour, if he had not been helping his teammate Romain Maes, when Maes was suffering."

        "text": "The 1936 Tour de France was the 30th edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 7 July to 2 August. It was composed of 21 stages with a total length of . Because of health problems, Henri Desgrange stopped as Tour director, and was succeeded by Jacques Goddet.\nThe race was won by Belgian cyclist Sylvère Maes. In the early stages, he battled with French Maurice Archambaud, until Archambaud lost many minutes on the eighth stage. Maes was then able to create a large margin with his new closest competitor Magne and teammate Vervaecke.\nThe team classification was won by the Belgian team, and Spanish cyclist Julián Berrendero won the mountains classification. There was also a one-time classification, based on points, that was won by Sylvère Maes.\nInnovations and changes.\nFor the first time, a stage was divided into three parts.\nThe race director at the start of the race was still Henri Desgrange, who had been race director since the first Tour de France in 1903. Desgrange, who was already 71 years old, had had kidney surgery weeks before the start of the Tour, but was determined to follow the Tour, and rode in a car full of cushions. After the second stage, he stopped, and made Jacques Goddet director. The individuals category which had been used in 1935 was not used in 1936.\nThe introduction of the summer holiday in France in 1936 meant that the number of spectators on the roadside increased.\nThe bonification system was the same as in 1935. This meant that the winner of a stage received 90 seconds, and the second cyclist 45 seconds. In addition, the winner received a bonification equal to the margin between him and the second cyclist, with a maximum of 2 minutes. The last bonification system was also used for the first cyclist to reach a mountain top that counted for the mountains classification.\nTeams.\nThe riders were divided into two categories: the national teams and the touriste-routiers. There were four big national teams with 10 cyclists each: the Belgian team, the German team, the Spanish/Luxembourgian team and the French team. There were also five small teams of 4 cyclists each: the Swiss team, the Dutch team, the Yugoslavian team, the Romanian team and the Austrian team. For the Dutch, Yugoslavian and Romanian teams, it was the first participation ever. The Italian team was absent for political reasons (the Second Italo-Abyssinian War). An Italian team consisting of Italians living in France had been allowed to the race and even had jersey numbers designated, but finally the Tour organisers changed their minds.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nStages 13b, 14b, 18b, 19b and 20b were all run in the team-time-trial format. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 7.\nRace overview.\nSwiss Paul Egli won the first stage, and thereby became the first Swiss cyclist to lead the general classification in the Tour de France. That first stage was run in terrible rain. In the second stage, the cyclists were split in two parts, and Egli was in the second part. Archambaud then took over the lead. Archambaud lost it to Luxembourgian Mersch in the next stage, but recaptured the lead when he won the fourth stage.\nThe competition really started in the mountains of the seventh stage. Belgian Romain Maes, the winner of the 1935 Tour, was first over the first mountain, but then gave up, a victim of chronic bronchitis. On the next climb, Georges Speicher, winner of the 1930 Tour, gave up. Archambaud was still in the lead after that stage. The stage was won by Theo Middelkamp, who became the first Dutch cyclist to win a Tour stage. Before the 1936 Tour, Middelkamp had never seen a mountain in his life.\nIn the eighth stage, Archambaud could not follow anymore, and Sylvère Maes took over the lead. In third place was Antonin Magne, who had a good chance to win the race.\nMagne attacked on the next stage, but could not drop Maes. Later, Magne had to let the leading group get away, and lost a minute to Maes.\nThe stages between the Alps and the Pyrenees were partly run as team time trials. The Belgian team was superior here, and Magne lost more time. When it was time for the Pyrenees, he was eight minutes behind Maes.\nIn stage 15, the podium did not change, so it had to happen in stage 16, the last mountain stage. Magne attacked, but was unable to win back time. Maes was better, and including time bonuses Maes won eighteen minutes on Magne in that stage.\nIn that stage, Belgian Félicien Vervaecke had borrowed a bicycle with derailleur. It was allowed for touriste-routiers, but not for national team members, and he was fined with ten minutes penalty time in the general classification. Magne also got 10 minutes penalty time, for having received food when it was not allowed. Due to this penalty, Vervaecke lost his second place in the general classification, which Magne took over.\nIn the last part of the race, Maes extended his lead thanks to the team time trials, although the French team was finally also able to win one.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nFor the mountain classification, 16 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. On the top of these mountains, ten points were given for the first cyclist to pass, nine points to the second cyclist, and so on, until the tenth cyclist who got one point.\nThere was also a points classification, for which the winner received 100.000 French Francs.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1936 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. The other teams that started the race, the German, Swiss, Yugoslavian, Romanian and Austrian teams, did not finish with the minimum three cyclists to be eligible for the team classification.\nAftermath.\nThe stage victory of the Dutch team convinced the Tour organisation to invite them in 1937 again."

        "title": "1937 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1937 Tour de France was the 31st edition of the Tour de France, taking place from 30 June to 25 July. It consisted of 20 stages with a total length of .\nCharles Holland and Bill Burl became the first British cyclists to ride the Tour. Burl lasted only two stages, but Holland rode well until he was eliminated on stage 14c after mechanical problems. The British Empire was also represented by the only non-European in the Tour: Canadian Pierre Gachon, who never completed the first stage. The complete Belgian team (including 1936 and 1939 winner Sylvère Maes) withdraw from the race because of \"French chauvinism\". Complaints from the Belgian team included of French spectators throwing stones at the Belgian team, closing train crossings, and throwing pepper in the eyes, and being punished unreasonable strictly (adding extra time in the standing) while French riders were hardly punished at all while being helped.\nThe race was won by French cyclist Roger Lapébie.\nInnovations and changes.\nThe Tours from 1903 to 1936 had all been organised by Henri Desgrange, but during the 1936 Tour de France he had to stop due to health reasons, and Jacques Goddet took over. The Tour in 1937 was the first Tour where Goddet was in charge, and one of the first rules that he changed was to allow gear changes. Each team had its own car with extra material to help with mechanical problems.\nTeams.\nThe Italian team, that had been absent from the 1936 Tour de France, returned in 1937, after Benito Mussolini removed their boycott of the Tour, and selected new star Gino Bartali, who had won the 1936 and 1937 Giro d'Italia, as the Italian team leader. The Italian team had 10 cyclists, just as the Belgian, German and French teams. There were also small teams of six cyclists: the Spanish, Dutch, Luxembourgian and Swiss teams. The last national team was the Great Britain-Canada team, consisting of two British cyclists and one Canadian.\nThe French team included Roger Lapébie. Lapébie had had a difficult relation with Desgrange. This had caused Lapébie to be out of the national team in 1935, and completely absent from the Tour in 1936. In 1937, Desgrange had retired, and Lapébie was back. In the month before the Tour started, Lapébie had undergone surgery for a lumbar hernia, and there were doubts about his form.\nThere were also 31 cyclists riding as individuals. These individuals were responsible for their own food and accommodation.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nRoute and stages.\nStage 19b was an individual time trial, stages 5b, 11b and 18a were team time trials, although the victory was still given the cyclist who crossed the line first. At the start of the Tour, it was also the intention to run stages 12b, 13b, 14b and 17b as time trials, but during the Tour the organisation changed the format. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit tunnel of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 7.\nRace overview.\nGerman Erich Bautz took the lead after the fourth stage, thanks to the bonification system that could give the winner of a stage some minutes bonification time.\nIn the seventh stage, Bartali took the stage victory, and with that the lead in the general classification. He was nine minutes ahead of Ward Vissers, and that could just be enough for the Tour victory.\nOn the eighth stage, Bartali could not avoid his teammate Jules Rossi who crashed right in front of him, and Bartali fell into a river. He got up and was able to finish the stage. He lost 10 minutes and kept the lead, but in the next stage he lost more than twenty minutes, and in the twelfth stage he gave up.\nIn the ninth stage, Sylvère Maes took over the lead, closely followed by Mario Vicini and Roger Lapébie. At that point, the French team was already down to six cyclists. These six cyclists had a meeting, and decided that Lapébie would be the team leader, as the rest of the team was already to far behind to have any chance for the final victory.\nBefore the start of the fifteenth stage, Lapébie found out that the frame of his bicycle had been sabotaged, causing his handlebars to break off. Lapébie made quick repairs and just made it to the start of the stage, but his newly constructed bicycle did not have a water holder, and he had to start the stage without water. This demotivated him, and Lapébie began losing time early in the stage. That stage included four mountains, and on top of the second mountain Lapébie was already five minutes behind, and wanted to give up. A teammate inspired him to go on, and Lapébie started to win back time. When Maes punctured, Lapébie was able to reach him, and at the end of the stage only Julián Berrendero was in front of them, and Lapébie won the sprint for the second place. This rewarded him with 45 seconds bonification time. When the tour directors gave him 90 seconds penalty time for having been pushed, the margin with Maes grew to more than three minutes, but Lapébie had sensed weakness in the Belgian team, and planned to attack in the next stage. The Belgian team complained that the penalty was far too little, because Lapébie's advantage had been much more. The French team threatened to abandon the race if the penalty would be increased, and the Tour direction did not change the penalty.\nIn the sixteenth stage Lapébie finished ahead of Maes, and cut the margin down to only 25 seconds, but with only flat stage that could be enough for Maes. During that sixteenth stage, Maes had punctured, and had been help by two Belgian cyclists, Gustaaf Deloor and Adolf Braeckeveldt. However, these Belgian cyclists rode as \"individuals\", and were not part of the Belgian team. The Tour jury then fined Maes with 15 seconds penalty time in the general classification. During the race, a train crossing had been closed just after Lapébie had passed, and just before Maes was about to pass. Maes was offended by all this, and quit the race, together with the rest of the Belgian team. From that point on, it was easy for Lapébie to secure his victory.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey. Leo Amberg became the first Swiss cyclist to reach the podium of the general classification in the Tour de France.\nFor the mountains classification, 17 mountains were selected by the Tour organisation. After the last mountain in the fifteenth stage, the classification was won by Félicien Vervaecke. Vervaecke did not finish the Tour, but in 1937 that was not needed to win the mountains classification.\nThe team classification was calculated in 1937 by adding up the times of the best three cyclists of a team; the team with the least time was the winner. The time for the Spanish team, which finished with only two cyclists, was calculated by adding the time of the final rider in the general classification, plus one hour penalty time. The Belgian, Dutch, and British-Canadian teams did not finish with two or more cyclists, so they were not eligible for the team classification.\nAftermath.\nThe riders in the individual category had performed very well in the 1937 Tour de France; the second-placed cyclist in the general classification had started in the individuals category, as were in total twelve cyclists in the top twenty. Still, the category was removed after 1937."

        "text": "David Lawrence McKay (born March 14, 1950) is a Canadian professional baseball coach and former second baseman and third baseman who is the first base coach for the Arizona Diamondbacks of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Minnesota Twins, Toronto Blue Jays, and Oakland Athletics, and has previously coached for the Athletics, St. Louis Cardinals, and Chicago Cubs. He is the father of former catcher Cody McKay.\nHe is a member of the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, elected in the Class of 2001.\nHe was inducted into the Columbia Basin College Hall of Fame in January 2012.\nPlaying career.\nMinnesota Twins (1975–76).\nMcKay signed as an amateur free agent with the Minnesota Twins on June 20, 1971, and worked his way through the Twins minor league organization, making his Major League debut on August 22, 1975, hitting a home run in his first at-bat against Vern Ruhle of the Detroit Tigers in an 8–4 victory. McKay appeared in 35 games with the Twins, hitting .256 with two home runs and 16 runs batted in.\nHe spent the majority of the 1976 season in the minor leagues, though did appear in 45 games with Minnesota, batting .203 with no homers and eight RBI. On November 5, the Twins left McKay unprotected at the 1976 MLB expansion draft where he was selected by the Toronto Blue Jays.\nToronto Blue Jays (1977–79).\nMcKay was the Blue Jays' starting third baseman for their first game on April 7, as the Canadian-born player had two hits in Toronto's 9–5 victory over the Chicago White Sox at Exhibition Stadium in Toronto. In 95 games with the Blue Jays, McKay hit .197 with three home runs and 22 RBI, splitting time between second base, third base and shortstop.\nMcKay became the Blue Jays' starting second baseman in 1978, playing in a career high 145 games, batting .238 with seven homers and 45 RBI. He finished sixth in the American League with six triples, and fifth with a .984 fielding percentage at second base.\nMcKay struggled in 1979, losing his starting job and spending time with the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate, the Syracuse Chiefs, for a majority of the season. With Toronto, McKay hit .218 with 0 HR and 12 RBI in 47 games. On November 5, the Blue Jays released McKay.\nOakland Athletics (1980–82).\nMcKay signed with the Oakland Athletics on April 4, 1980, and in 129 games with the Athletics, McKay hit .244 with one homer and 29 RBI as a utility infielder.\nHe improved offensively in 1981, hitting .263 with four home runs and 21 RBI in 79 games, helping Oakland reach the playoffs. In the 1981 American League Divisional Series, McKay hit .273 with a home run and an RBI as the Athletics defeated the Kansas City Royals to advance to the American League Championship Series. In the ALCS, McKay again hit .273, with an RBI, as Oakland lost to the New York Yankees.\nMcKay struggled during the 1982 season, hitting only .198 with four home runs and 17 RBI in 78 games.\nHe spent the 1983 season with Oakland's A and AAA teams before retiring as a player; he joined the Oakland coaching staff under manager Jackie Moore the following season.\nMcKay appeared in 645 games during his career, recording 441 hits and had a .229 batting average with 21 home runs and 170 RBI. In six career playoff games, McKay hit .273 with one home run and two RBI.\nCoaching career.\nThe 2024 season marked McKay's 40th consecutive campaign as a Major League coach, and his eleventh with the Diamondbacks. The previous three decades were spent with three teams: the Athletics (1984–1995), St. Louis Cardinals (1996–2011) and Chicago Cubs (2012–2013). Although almost every year of his coaching career (including his current post) has been spent as a first-base coach, however he spent 1988 as the strength and conditioning coach of the A's. He and José Canseco co-authored a book on proper weight training techniques for baseball players.\nMcKay began a long-term professional association with both manager Tony La Russa and pitching coach Dave Duncan from the midpoint of the 1986, when LaRussa and Duncan took over their respective positions with Oakland, through 2011 with the Cardinals. The three were on staff for six pennant-winning and three world championship teams—the 1989 Athletics and the 2006 and 2011 Cardinals.\nA close friend of LaRussa's, McKay had intended to retire from baseball when LaRussa did. When LaRussa announced his retirement in 2011, McKay realized he was not ready. He was offered the opportunity to remain with the Cardinals in another capacity, and did not blame the organization for not welcoming him back to his former job as first base coach, as the Cardinals' front office was under the impression he planned on retiring with LaRussa.\nHe joined the Cubs for the 2012 season. After two years with the Cubs, working under Dale Sveum, McKay was named to the Diamondbacks' 2014 coaching staff by manager Kirk Gibson, replacing Steve Sax. McKay is responsible for coaching the team's outfielders as well as for his work at first base.\nDuring a spring training game on March 8, 2021, against the San Francisco Giants, McKay fell against a metal railing in the dugout, breaking a rib and lacerating his spleen."

The Foundation appointed the British representative of the family, Max Rowe, to turn the dream into reality. He organized a special committee whose members included, among others, the mayor of Jerusalem Teddy Kollek, the Director General of the Ministry of Tourism, Meir de Shalit, and the Foreign Minister at the time, Abba Eban, who headed the committee. The committee commissioned the architect Fred Smith. After design difficulties and efforts to find suitable grass that could withstand the Middle-Eastern climate, the course was built and an irrigation system that included an underground network of pipes was installed.\nThe committee set out to draft golfers and to promote the sport in Israel and the golf course abroad. The opening ceremony, in January 1961, was attended by prominent politicians.\nThe “Israel Golf Federation” was established in 1965, four years after the opening of the golf club.\nThe Club was renovated and upgraded several times over the years, as systems were replaced and modernized, requiring huge financial resources. In 1980, after a new irrigation system was installed at a cost of millions of Israeli shekels, the members convened a general meeting to petition Edmond de Rothschild to increase the annual subsidy for the club. He rejected the demand and transferred management of the club to the Caesarea Development Corporation.\nAmong the visitors to the club have been Sean Connery, Kirk Douglas, Frank Sinatra, and Danny Kaye. Notable Israeli figures included Chaim Herzog, who were members. Laetitia Beck took her first steps as a golfer at the Caesarea Golf Course, and it was in Caesarea that her parents, avid golfers, made their home. In 2008 Laetitia was chosen as one of Israel’s “sportswomen of the decade” as part of the State of Israel’s 60th anniversary celebrations.\nThe golf course was reopened in 2009, after it was completely redesigned and renovated by architect Pete Dye. As a passionate supporter of environmentally-friendly golf courses, Dye planned the course based on environmental and landscape preservation values. In 2010 the Caesarea golf course joined the list of the Rolex World's Top 1000 Golf Courses.\nThe club now spans 6750 sq/m and has two golf courses: a professional 18-hole course, the only one in Israel that meets international standards, and another 9-hole course used mainly for practice and for learning the game. Since 1961 the Club hosts the Maccabiah Games once every four years."

In college, he played for the University of Minnesota and the University of Maryland. Professionally, he played five seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as well as in Italy and Spain.\nEarly life.\nColeman was born on November 14, 1961, in Minneapolis. He played basketball at North Community High School. After graduation, he received a scholarship to play at the University of Minnesota. In 1979, he became the first player from Minneapolis North to receive a scholarship from a Division I college. He was also the first African-American player from a Minneapolis City Conference school to play for Minnesota.\nHe spent much of his time at Minnesota coming off the bench. In his redshirt freshman year of 1980–1981, he averaged 8.4 points and 5.1 rebounds per game. After that season, he decided to transfer to the University of Maryland. Coleman commented that he was able to make a statement for his community by playing for his hometown Gophers, but also faced a lot of pressure playing there. Under transfer rules, he sat out the 1981–1982 season.\nAt Maryland, Coleman teamed up with Len Bias, who went on to be the second overall pick in the 1986 NBA draft. He won two All-ACC honors and helped the team to the 1984 Atlantic Coast Conference championship and to a Sweet Sixteen appearance in the 1984 NCAA tournament.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduation, he was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the second round (37th overall) in the 1984 NBA draft. He did not make the Bulls roster and decided to sign with Stefanel Trieste in Italy's Serie A. The Bulls traded his rights to the Portland Trail Blazers for Mike Smrek, but he again failed to make the team and returned to Italy. After two years in Italy, he returned to the United States and signed with the New Jersey Nets.\nIn the middle of his second season with the Nets, New Jersey traded him and Mike Gminski to the Philadelphia 76ers for Roy Hinson and Tim McCormick. He played the remainder of the 1988–89 season in Philadelphia. Before the 1989–90 NBA season, he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks but his season was cut short due to injury in February and he was waived.\nThe following season he began a three-year stint in Spain, signing with Baloncesto León in Spain. He moved to FC Barcelona and CB Peñas Huesca.\nFor the 1993–94 NBA season, Coleman returned to the U.S. with the Rapid City Thrillers of the Continental Basketball Association. He signed a ten-day contract with the Detroit Pistons. After Detroit did not retain him, he played on a rest-of-season contract with Roma and the following season with Montecatiniterme Basketball in Italy.\nHe ended his playing career with the Sioux Falls Skyforce and Omaha Racers of the CBA.\nAfter he retired, Coleman coached in the greater Minneapolis area with the private coaching service, CoachUp.\nColeman died on January 6, 2019, at age 57."

        "text": "The Northern Cement basketball team (popularly known as, the NCC basketball team) refers to the team that represented the national basketball program and training pool for the Philippines men's national basketball team from 1980 to 1986. The team was owned by businessman Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, Jr. through his company, Northern Cement Corporation (NCC).\nBeginnings.\nIn 1980, businessman and ambassador Eduardo \"Danding\" Cojuangco, founder and owner of Northern Cement Corporation, was appointed by the Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to become the project director for basketball in the country. Cojuangco (despite not being an officer or member of the national basketball governing body at that time - the Basketball Association of the Philippines) was tasked to set up, finance, and develop the national basketball team to represent the country internationally. During that time, the best players in the country were playing in the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), the first professional basketball league in the Philippines, and in Asia. With the Fédération Internationale de Basketball Amateur ruling that only amateur basketball players would be allowed to participate in national basketball team tournaments, Cojuangco sought a way to keep the Philippine basketball competitive on the international stage, without the country's best players.\nAmerican collegiate coaches Ron Jacobs and Ben Lindsey were brought in to handle the team. Eventually, Jacobs became NCC's head coach.\nThe first NCC team (1981-1982).\nSeeking to fast-track the success of the program, the first team formed in 1981 (known as the RP Training Team) was mainly made up of eight American players who became naturalized Filipinos (a practice also common to European national teams at that time) which included Dennis Still and Jeff Moore. Two Filipino-Americans, Willie Pearson, and National Basketball Association Filipino-American draftee Ricardo Brown were included, along with two local players in JB Yango and Frankie Lim, both from San Beda College. This was done with the intention of passing on new basketball technology to the Filipino cagers.\nThe team (playing as Northern Cement) easily won the 4th William Jones Cup in 1981, but failed to gain support among Filipino fans, as they viewed the program as merely having foreigners represent the country. This team was eventually scrapped, and Jacobs was then asked to develop local talents instead.\nIn 1981, at the Southeast Asian Games held in Manila, Jacobs was tasked to retain the country's gold medal in men's basketball. Noting the lack of competition, Jacobs decided to appoint former UE Red Warriors head coach Pilo Pumaren as coach for the Philippine team, made up of players from the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association. The team successfully retained the gold medal.\nIn 1982, Jacobs mentored the Philippines' under-19 basketball team to the Asian Basketball Confederation Juniors Championship in his first official tournament as head coach for the Philippines' teams. The team included players such as Alfie Almario, Elmer Reyes, Tonichi Ytturi, Franz Pumaren, Teddy Alfarero, Rey Cuenco, Leo Austria, Jong Uichico, Hector Calma, and Louie Brill. The team beat China in the final at the Araneta Coliseum in Manila. However, even as Jacobs went about developing local talents, the players were still deemed \"raw\".\nThe second NCC team (1983 ABC championships).\nIn 1983, some recruits from the De La Salle squad that was also under the wings of Danding Cojuangco and five naturalized players began training for their ultimate goal of regaining the Asian Basketball Confederation (ABC) title in Hong Kong. It was a formidable team composed of Hector Calma, Franz Pumaren, Tonichi Yturri, Alfie Almario, Jun Tan, Joseph Uichico, Teddy Alfarero and naturalized players Dennis Still, Jeff Moore, Chip Engelland, Johnny Nash and John Hegwood.\nUpon arrival, they learned that their naturalized Filipinos were not recognized by the ABC and were therefore disallowed from playing. It was resolved by allowing only two of the five to play and this only because they had field in the minimum residency required by the statutes of law for naturalizing foreigners. Using only Dennis Still and Jeff Moore, coach Ron Jacobs piloted the team to a sweep of its qualifying matches and were all set for a showdown with China when the decision come out that the RP squad had used illegal players and therefore - all their games in which the naturalized players were fielded in were forfeited.\nThe Philippine contingent accepted the decision with bowed heads and finished the tournament in ninth place despite a clean slate.\nPBA (1984–1985).\nNCC competed as a guest team for four conferences during the 1984 and 1985 PBA seasons and they won the 1985 PBA Reinforced Conference championship. The team went on to represent the Philippines and captured the 1984 Asian Basketball Club Championship in Ipoh, Malaysia, as well as the 1985 William Jones Cup championship (playing as San Miguel Beer). Because of their win at the Asian Interclub Championship, the team represented the Asian region at the 1985 FIBA Club World Cup at Girona, Spain (playing as Northern Consolidated Cement).\nThe 1984 roster that first participated in the PBA:\nIn December 1984, UAAP stars Allan Caidic, Pido Jarencio, Benji Gutierrez, Jerry Codiñera, and Leo Austria joined the NCC team playing exhibition games against PBA clubs during the third conference. Northerns second team was coached by veteran coach Francisco Calilan. The first team that went to Malaysia for the Asian Interclub championship were composed of Moore, Engelland, Calma, Joseph Uichico, Franz Pumaren, Leoncio Tan, Elmer Reyes, Tonichi Yturri, Avelino \"Samboy\" Lim and Yves Dignadice.\nCaidic, Jarencio and Codiñera became regular members of the national team in the following year while Leo Austria went on to join the first-ever PBA draft.\n1985 FIBA Asia Championship.\nIn 1985, the members of the NCC team played for the country's national basketball team. The NCC-powered national team won the 1985 Southeast Asian Games basketball tournament and the Asian Basketball Confederation Championship on January 5, 1986, at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, tournament which the country had not won since 1973. In winning the ABC Championship, the team qualified for the 1986 World Basketball Championship in Madrid, Spain and the 1986 Goodwill Games. At this time, Jacobs mapped out a new plan to ensure continuity in the national team program. New local players such as Benjie Paras, Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codiñera were already being eyed to replace the aging Still and Moore. Engelland, on the other hand, was already honing the shooting skills of Allan Caidic, Naning Valenciano and Pido Jarencio. Amateur star Jojo Lastimosa was expected to fill Engelland's slot on the team in the future (Engelland eventually became the shooting coach of the San Antonio Spurs). However, the NCC program was scrapped in the aftermath of the 1986 People Power Revolution in the Philippines. The Philippines was forced to withdraw from the World Championship as a result.\nDisbandment.\nAfter the fall of the Marcos government in 1986, the program was scrapped by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP), which was the national basketball governing body of the country at that time. The players of NCC went on to play in the Philippine Basketball Association, with most of them ending up in Cojuangco's San Miguel Beer team. Some of the NCC players would again see action for the national team at the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing, China, which copped a silver medal.\nIn 1994, the San Miguel Beer PBA team won the 1994 PBA All-Filipino Cup championship and earned the right to represent the country in the upcoming Asian Games, held at Hiroshima, Japan. The national team was composed of the San Miguel players serving as the core of the team and other PBA players (notably Alvin Patrimonio from Purefoods and Johnny Abarrientos from Alaska) and amateur standouts (notably Marlou Aquino from the Philippine Basketball League). The team, led by NCC alumni Allan Caidic and Hector Calma, went on to finish fourth with Caidic finishing as the Asian Games basketball tournament top scorer."

        "title": "Tom Cheney (baseball)",
        "text": "Thomas Edgar Cheney (October 14, 1934 – November 1, 2001) was an American Major League Baseball player. Cheney, a right-handed pitcher from Morgan, Georgia, played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates and Washington Senators in a span of eight seasons from 1957 to 1966. \nCheney is most notable for striking out the highest number of batters in a Major League Baseball game. He did so on September 12, 1962, when as a Senator, struck out 21 Baltimore Orioles in 16 innings en route to a 2–1 victory.\nProfessional career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nCheney was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals prior to the start of the baseball season. After spending a few years in the minor leagues, he was called up by the Cardinals in , and made his Major League Baseball debut with the team on April 21, 1957. Cheney pitched in four games during the season, starting in three of them. He posted an 0–1 record with a 15.00 earned run average in 9 innings of work, giving up 6 hits, while walking 15 batters and striking out 10.\nThe following year, , Cheney did not play in baseball, as he was serving in the United States military. Cheney returned to baseball for the season with the Cardinals, primarily serving as a relief pitcher in the 11 games he pitched during the season. Cheney again had issues with his control and accuracy. He walked 11 men in just innings of work. He was 0–1 for the season, with a 6.92 ERA, along with giving up 17 hits and striking out 8 batters. \nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn December 21, 1959, in the midst of the off-season, Cheney was traded by the St. Louis Cardinals with his teammate, outfielder Gino Cimoli, to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for relief pitcher Ron Kline.\nThe Pirates hoped to make Cheney the starting pitcher with control and accuracy that they could depend on. Cheney progressed as a pitcher that season, and put up improved stats that season, pitching a 2–2 record in eleven games (eight as starting pitcher) with a decent 3.98 earned run average. Cheney only gave up 44 hits while walking 33 men and striking out 35 in 52 innings of work. As a pitcher, Cheney improved remarkably in his transition from the Cardinals to the Pirates. The Pittsburgh Pirates team went on to the World Series after posting an impressive 95–59 record in the regular season. The Pirates defeated the New York Yankees four games to three games, winning the franchise's 3rd overall World Series, and first since . The series was decided by a walk-off home run in the 9th inning of Game 7, when Bill Mazeroski took a 1–0 pitch and crushed it over the left-field fence, giving Pittsburgh the championship. Cheney served as a relief pitcher in the World Series and pitched four innings in three games (Game 2, 3, and 6), giving up four hits and two earned runs while only walking one batter and striking out six.\nIn , Cheney started off with a terrible performance, giving up 4 earned runs and walking 4 batters in less than a third of an inning.\nWashington Senators.\nCheney was traded to the Washington Senators on June 29, 1961, in exchange for pitcher Tom Sturdivant. He served as both a starting pitcher and relief pitcher for the remainder of the season with the Washington Senators. He did not fare well, and he again showed signs of lack of control with his pitching. He posted a 1–3 record in 10 games, 7 of which he started. He put in innings of work and gave up 32 hits and 29 earned runs. He walked 26 batters and struck out 20. His earned run average ballooned to 8.79, giving him an ERA of 10.00 for the season.\nNonetheless, Cheney was on the roster for the Washington Senators in . Cheney pitched in 37 games in total, starting 25 of them. He pitched to a 7–9 record with four complete games and three shutouts and showed drastic improvement in all aspects of his pitching. He pitched stellarly in innings, giving up only 134 hits while walking 97 and striking out 147. His ERA for the season was a career-best 3.17. Cheney finished second in the American League in both strikeouts per nine innings and hits allowed per nine innings. was perhaps Cheney's best remembered season. On September 12, 1962, Tom Cheney set the Major League Baseball record for strikeouts in a regular-season game. Cheney pitched brilliantly in 16 innings of work, giving up only one run while striking out a record 21 Baltimore Orioles. Cheney had 13 strikeouts through nine innings.\nSenators manager Mickey Vernon later wanted to make a change, reportedly asking the pitcher: \"Your arm okay? You sure you don't want me to take you out?\", to which Cheney replied . .\n\"I told him I didn't want to come out\", Cheney said. \"Back in those days, you finished what you started.\" Cheney wound up pitching eight straight hitless innings near the end. With his 228th and final pitch, he slipped a called third strike past pinch-hitter Dick Williams, who went on to become a major league manager.\nIt was not until the bottom of the 16th inning that teammate Bud Zipfel hit the game-winning home run off Orioles pitcher Dick Hall giving the Senators a hard-fought 2–1 victory and Cheney a win and a major league record that still stands. Roger Clemens, Kerry Wood, and Max Scherzer came close to Cheney's record, but all three failed, each striking out 20 men in their respective 9-inning regulation games.\nTeammate Don Lock says of his gifts:\nSix days after his great performance, on September 18, 1962, Cheney suffered a setback at D.C. Stadium. Cheney gave up two home runs to Mickey Mantle and lost the game 7–1 to Ralph Terry and the New York Yankees (who would go on to win the 1962 World Series).\nCheney again pitched skillfully in , a season that is probably considered his best season during his 8-year major league career. Cheney only pitched half the season, but finished with career-bests in wins, complete games, shutouts, and ERA. Cheney pitched in a total of 23 games that season, serving as the starting pitcher in 21 of them. He posted an 8–9 record, a 2.71 ERA along with 7 complete games and 4 shutouts. Tom gave up just 99 hits in innings of work and dominated batters by walking only 40 and striking out 97. However, in July 1963, Cheney suffered a devastating elbow injury that played a major role in prematurely ending his major league career just after he was starting to appear as one of the premier pitchers in the American League. Cheney played minimally with the Washington Senators in and . He pitched in his last game on May 9, 1966.\nHis daughter Terri Cook says of his career:\nCareer stats and death.\nIn his career, Cheney started 71 games and came in for relief in 44 more. He finished with a 19–29 record, a 3.77 ERA, 13 complete games, 8 of which were shutouts. He picked up 2 saves, once in and again in . Tom Cheney pitched in a total of 466 innings, giving up just 382 hits, while walking 245 and striking out 345.\nTom Cheney died at the age of 67 on November 1, 2001, in Rome, Georgia."

        "title": "Rugby union in Japan",
        "text": "Rugby union in Japan is a moderately popular sport. Japan has the fourth largest population of rugby union players in the world and the sport has been played there for over a century. There are 125,000 Japanese rugby players, 3,631 official rugby clubs, and the Japan national team is ranked 12th in the world.\nHistory.\nBefore the arrival of rugby, Japan was home to a game known as \"kemari\" (), which in some ways was a parallel development to association football, and to a lesser extent rugby football. It is said that \"kemari\" was introduced to Japan from China in about 600 AD, during the Asuka period, and was based upon the Chinese sport of cuju. The object of Kemari is to keep one ball in the air, with all players cooperating to do so. The ball, known as a \"mari\", is made of deerskin with the hair facing inside and the hide on the outside. Kemari has been revived in modern times, and the players still wear the traditional costumes for the game.\nEarly history.\nLike many Western customs, rugby football first reached Japan when gunboat diplomacy deployed by the United States and European powers ended the country's period of self-imposed isolation in 1854.\nThe first recorded instance of a team being established and rugby being played in Japan was in 1866 with the founding of the Yokohama Foot Ball Club. The rules committee of the club consisted of notable Rugby School, Radley and Winchester College alumni including Capt. Charles Rochefort and Capt. Robert Blount of the 20th (The East Devonshire) Regiment of Foot and Royal Navy Lieutenant Lord Walter Kerr. Other Rugby School alumni soon followed including George Hamilton who became captain of the Yokohama team. Games, mainly between service personnel, were played on the Garrison Parade Ground in Yamate, Yokohama.\nIn 1874 records also illustrate British sailors staging a game in Yokohama. Other games were played at other treaty ports such as Kobe between teams of long-term foreign residents and visiting ships' crews, garrisons etc., but they rarely involved indigenous Japanese people.\nThe date of local Japanese participation in the sport is most frequently cited as 1899, when students at Keio University were introduced to the game by Professor Edward Bramwell Clarke (who was born in Yokohama) and Ginnosuke Tanaka (田中 銀之助). Both Clarke and Tanaka were graduates of Cambridge University. Japanese rugby only started to grow in the 1920s. Clarke taught English and coached rugby union at Keio from 1899 to 1910, after which an injury to his right leg forced him to give up playing.\nClarke said that he wanted to give his students something constructive to do, as they\nEarly 20th century.\nIn 1901, Keio University played \"Yokohama Foreigners\" losing 35–5, but the game demonstrated that the racial barriers in the sport were breaking down. Prof. Clarke played in this game, taking the conversion, after a student called Shiyoda scored a try. From Keio, Japanese rugby swept to the other universities of Japan, and to this day, the private universities remain a stronghold of the Japanese game. Doshisha and Waseda played their first inter-university game in 1923. The Keio and Waseda match, a long running rivalry between two of Tokyo's most prominent universities, has been played annually since 1924.\nThe growth of Japanese rugby in the early 20th century at the height of the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was rapid; by the 1920s, there were nearly 1,500 rugby clubs, and more than 60,000 registered players, which meant that its resources were larger than those of Scotland, Wales and Ireland combined. Despite these extremely impressive figures, Japanese rugby was still isolated, and to an extent insular – the first rugby tours to Japan did not occur until the 1930s.\nThe JRFU published a pamphlet about the same time called \"The Land of the Rising Scrum\". (a pun on the country's Japanese name, \"Nihon\", meaning \"Land of the Rising \"Sun\"\"), and the Japanese Royal Family have been keen supporters of the game for many decades.\nJapan and Canada had the first tour outside the main \"traditional\" rugby playing nations. Japan toured British Columbia in 1930, and Canada went on a tour of Japan in 1932. Canada won 5/6 of their first matches in Japan, before being defeated 38–5 by the Japanese national team, in front of a crowd of 25,000 on 31 January 1932. The Canadian team had been brought over by a trade delegation.\nThe Canadians ascribed their defeat to, \"excessive entertaining, too many games in a short period, and the inspired play of the Japanese in front of the assembled nobility of Japan.\"\nIn 1934, an Australian Universities side toured Japan, and lost to Keio and Waseda, in front of crowds of more than 20,000.\nPrince Chichibu.\nAfter World War II, Prince Chichibu was honorary head of many athletic organizations, and was nicknamed the \"sporting Prince\" due to his efforts to promote skiing, rugby union and other sports.\nHe was \"converted\" to rugby after, JRFU president, Shigeru Kayama returned from a long sea voyage and was able to \"market\" the game to Prince Chichibu. He attended Oxford University, but was only there for one term, and had to return when his father, the Emperor Taishō died. In Japan, his interest was further strengthened when he saw Keio play Waseda. He became president of the JRFU himself in 1926.\nAfter his death in 1953, the Tokyo Rugby Stadium in Kita-Aoyama 2-chome was renamed Chichibunomiya Rugby Stadium (秩父宮ラグビー場 – Chichibunomiya Ragubī-jō). A statue of Prince Chichibu in a rugby uniform was erected there.\nTōjō Regime and Second World War.\nIn the later 1930s and early 1940s, the Fascistic Japanese regime tended to be hostile to the game, as it was seen as particularly foreign, despite the fact that the Japanese royal family continued to support the game. As a result, rugby was rebranded \"tōkyū\", meaning \"fighting ball\".\nThe consequences of World War II would leave many Japanese players dead, with bombing destroying much of its physical infrastructure.\nHowever, games continued during the Second World War until 1943, when military control of pitches, and the lack of available players took their toll.\nPost-war period.\nJapanese rugby made a surprisingly speedy recovery in the post-war period, despite massive damage to infrastructure, and the death of many players. In September 1945, less than a month after the end of the war, an advertisement for rugby players in Hokkaido managed to draw no less than fifty people to a meeting. On 23 September 1945, the first post-war schools match was held in Kyoto. Kobe Steel encouraged the game amongst its workers at the end of 1945, believing it would raise their morale, and set a precedent for the later heavy corporate involvement in Japanese rugby.\nIn the 1950s, Japan was toured by two of England's major university sides. Oxford University toured Japan in 1952, and 1956, and Cambridge University toured there in 1953. In 1959, a combined Oxbridge side toured the country. The Junior All Blacks toured in 1958, winning the three \"tests\" against All Japan.\nJapan beat the Junior All Blacks 23–19 in 1968. After losing the first four matches on a tour of New Zealand, they won the last five.\n1970s.\nIn 1971, England toured Japan. Shiggy Konno admitted that lack of height amongst the Japanese players was a problem, but said that it made it –\nThe Japanese (coached by Waseda University Professor Onishi Tetsunosuke) lost by just 3–6 to England in Tokyo on 29 September 1971 in the RFU's centenary year.\nThe first tour by Japan of Great Britain was in 1973.\nDespite Japan's vast playing resources, it has a major problem in the lack of pitches, since Japan is highly urbanised and land is at a premium in the country. This sometimes results in a pitch being used for games from 6 am to late at night. Japan also has a praiseworthy lack of violence and thuggery in its rugby; according to legend, a game between army sides in 1975 got out of hand, resulting in both units being disbanded, the commanding officers sacked, and every player being banned \"sine die\". Supposedly, there has been no problem since.\nThe Japanese team are known for their speed and resourcefulness, but have sometimes been at a disadvantage due to their smaller size compared to Southern Hemisphere and European players. This is changing, however.\nJapan have not performed too well in the top ranks of the international game. 1990 was a high point – they beat a Scotland XV, which was the national side in all but name. They have qualified for every Rugby World Cup, and won nearly every Asian Championship, despite some strong challenges from South Korea, but they have hardly ever beaten the main teams. In the world cups, their first victory was over Zimbabwe, who had qualified partly as the African representative (South Africa was excluded due to their racist \"apartheid\" regime).\nThere is also a statue of a scrum capped rugby player outside the Olympic Stadium. Statues of sports people are relatively rare in Japan.\n1980s.\nJapan gave Wales a fright in losing by a slim five-point margin, 24–29, at Cardiff Arms Park on 2 October 1983.\nOn 28 May 1989 a strong Japan coached by Hiroaki Shukuzawa defeated an under-strength Scotland, missing nine British Lions on tour in Australia, for the first ever time at Chichibunomiya rugby stadium, 28–24. The Japan team included such Kobe Steel stalwarts as centre Seiji Hirao (captain), and locks Atsushi Oyagi and Toshiyuki Hayashi (38 Japan caps and a member of Oxford University's all-time best XV). Sinali Latu at No. 8 was then a fourth year student at Daito Bunka University, and speedy Yoshihito Yoshida on the wing (no. 14) was a third year at Meiji University. Scotland missed an incredible seven penalties and refused the kicking tee which was generously offered – as a surviving video of the game shows. It was almost the same Japanese team which defeated Zimbabwe in the 1991 Rugby Union World Cup.\nAccusations of \"shamateurism\" and foreign players.\nThe Japanese have traditionally been strong proponents of amateurism in rugby union, but traditionally many of their teams have been run by major corporations, and that the players as employees of these companies were guilty of a form of \"shamateurism\".\nIn the 1970s, large numbers of foreign players started playing in Japan in corporate teams. However, Japanese rugby was by no means alone in this regard in the pre-professional era.\nA major example of this phenomenon was the \"Wallaby\" Ian Williams who played for Kobe Steel. Williams estimated in 1994 that there were 100 foreigners playing rugby in Japan, receiving double the local wage, and that maybe as few as half a dozen had \"real jobs\". As late as 1995, Shiggy Konno wrote in a 1995 memo to the IRB that \"I am not assured that our instructions have been kept [concerning professionalism].\"\nOther top international players in Japan, including the Tongan international Sinali Latu have ended up playing for the Japanese national side, while a whole range of top internationals such as Norm Hadley and Joe Stanley have become employees of various Japanese companies. A notable Japanese proponent of amateurism was Shiggy Konno.\n1990s.\nIn the 1990s, a Pacific Rim contest including the US, Canada, Japan, Hong Kong, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and Argentina (which has no Pacific coast) was going to be held, but was aborted after the $2 million sponsorship for the contest could not be found.\nPresent day.\nJapanese training methods have been criticised for focussing more on discipline than initiative. One common drill is the \"run pass\", which involves players running the length of the field and exchanging passes, often for as long as an hour or more.\nThe former Japanese prime minister, Yoshirō Mori (森 喜朗) in June 2005 became President of the Japan Rugby Football Union. It had been hoped his clout would help secure the 2011 Rugby World Cup for Japan, but instead the event was awarded to New Zealand in late November 2005. This led former Mori to accuse members of the Commonwealth of Nations of \"passing the ball around their friends.\"\nIn 2015 tambo rugby, a form of tag rugby played in muddy rice fields, was introduced in Kyoto Prefecture.\nThe 2019 Rugby World Cup was held in Japan, the first time in Asia.\nNotable matches.\nIn the 1995 World Cup, Japan suffered a 145–17 loss to New Zealand, the second worst in the history of the tournament, at the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein.\nAt the 2015 Rugby World Cup, Japan beat South Africa 34–32 in their opening Pool B match, producing arguably the biggest shock in the history of professional rugby union.\nIn the 2016 Super Rugby, the Sunwolves were defeated 92–17 by the Cheetahs, again at Bloemfontein.\nIn the 2019 World Cup, Japan were drawn in Group A alongside Ireland, Russia, Samoa, and Scotland. After an opening night win against Russia (30-10), Japan went on to beat Ireland 19–12, a huge upset and a result few predicted. Their third group game against Samoa ended in another win, this time 38-19, while also securing a highly important bonus point (for scoring four or more tries).\nIn the highly anticipated final group game against Scotland, both teams needed to win to progress to the knockout stages at the expense of the other. The match went ahead despite pre-game worries that it would have to be cancelled due to the ongoing issues caused by Typhoon Hagibis. The pre-tournament rules stated that if the typhoon was sufficient enough to intervene, the game would be cancelled, and the result declared a draw. This controversial rule would have allowed Japan to progress by default due to previous results.\nAfter final safety checks, the game was allowed to commence. In a topsy turvey game, Japan edged out Scotland 28-21 to register their second shock win of the tournament. They also became the first Asian nation to top their group at a Rugby World Cup, and the first asian team to progress to the knockout stages.\nJapan played South Africa in the quarter-finals. South Africa were victorious by a score of 26-3.\nGoverning body.\nRugby union in Japan is governed by the Japan Rugby Football Union.\nThe Japan Rugby Football Union was officially formed on 30 November 1926, and became a full member of World Rugby (then known as the International Rugby Football Board) in 1987, just before the 1987 Rugby World Cup. The JRFU also received a seat on the body's Executive Council at that time.\n It is also a founding member of the Asian Rugby Football Union.\n2019 Rugby World Cup.\nJapan was announced as the host for the 2019 Rugby World Cup on 28 July 2009 at a special IRB meeting in Dublin.\nTwelve stadiums were used to host the 2019 World Cup matches:\nDomestic competitions.\nTop League.\nIn 2003, the Top League was created to improve the overall standards of Japanese rugby union. It is Japan's first nationwide league and is a first step towards professionalism. So far the league is proving to be successful with many closely fought and exciting games, though attendances at games are generally not high and tend to be limited to diehard fans and company employees.\nThe Lixil Cup, formerly known as the Microsoft Cup, is a Japanese knockout rugby tournament initially sponsored by Microsoft Japan. It is played between the top teams of the Top League.\nAll-Japan Championship.\nThis is played at the end of the season and includes Top League teams, the top two universities and the champion club team.\nClubs championship.\nThe fifteenth annual clubs championship final was held on 17 February 2008 at Chichibunomiya between Tamariba Club and Rokko Seahawks and won by the former 21–0. The winner (Tamariba) will enter the first round of the All-Japan championships.\nUniversity and high school.\nThe All-Japan University Rugby Championship (全国大学ラグビーフットボール選手権大会 – Zenkoku Daigaku Ragubi- Futtobo-ru Senshuken Taikai) have been held annually since 1964 to determine the top University Rugby team. In 1964 only 4 teams competed in the playoffs; qualifying teams coming from regional university leagues. From 1965 to 1992 there were 8 teams competing in the playoffs and finally expanding to 16 teams from 1993 onwards.\nThe National High School Rugby Tournament is held annually at Kintetsu Hanazono rugby stadium in East Osaka, from the end of December to early January. All 47 of Japan's prefectures are represented, with four extra teams (one from Hokkaido, one from Tokyo, and two from Osaka prefecture) to make up the numbers.\nIt is a highly successful national schools championship, with over 800 teams competing.\nPopularity.\nAs a team sport, rugby union is ranked fifth in the popularity ratings behind baseball, football, basketball and volleyball. This reality is unlikely to change until Japan's national rugby union team becomes consistently successful on the world stage, especially at the Rugby World Cup. However, the sport is considered to have potential as its current number of registered players (125,000) matches the player numbers of some of the top rugby nations.\nAt present rugby union is rarely seen on the terrestrial TV channels, and is mainly restricted to CS and cable subscription channels, which hinders its growth. (Sometimes the bigger games are shown on NHK TV – e.g. the University championship rugby final and the Microsoft Cup.)\nNational team.\nThe national team (which is named \"The Cherry Blossoms\") is ranked 11th worldwide by World Rugby as of 11 September 2017 (World Rugby Rankings).\nWith Asia's relative weakness at rugby union, Japan struggles to get serious competition. The result is that Japan is caught in the middle: a big fish in the small pond of Asian rugby union, but still at present a relative minnow in the vast ocean of international rugby union.\nThe national team is also usually reinforced for the World Cup by one or two foreign-born players who qualify under World Rugby regulations. Of these Andrew Miller and Andrew McCormick, both from New Zealand, and Sinali Latu from Tonga have been the most successful.\nRugby World Cup.\nJapan have played in every Rugby World Cup since the inaugural tournament in 1987. They hosted the 2019 Rugby World Cup. With their victory over South Africa in the 2015 they won their second-ever game in the Rugby World Cup. They went on to become the first team ever to win three pool matches in a single World Cup but still fail to advance to the knockout stage.\nPacific Nations Cup.\nThe Pacific Nations Cup is an international rugby union competition held between six Pacific rim sides; Fiji, Japan, Samoa, Tonga, Australia A and New Zealand Māori.\nOther competitions.\nThe Asian Five Nations is a competition to develop rugby in Asia, starting in 2008.\nThe Super Cup was an annual international rugby union competition contested by national teams from Canada, Japan, Russia and United States. It was previously known as the Super Powers Cup, and has now been replaced by the IRB Nations Cup.\nJapan won the tournament in 2004.\nThe 2011–12 season of the Sevens World Series, an annual circuit featuring men's national teams in rugby sevens, saw the debut of the newly created Japan Sevens tournament. The event was scheduled over a weekend at Chichibunomiya; the first edition straddled March and April.\nFollowing the 2014–15 series, Tokyo was removed from the series schedule and replaced by Singapore.\nSuper Rugby.\nJapan were awarded a place in the annual Super Rugby competition from 2016 onwards. A Super Rugby franchise known as the Sunwolves was created to take part in the 18-team competition, which also featured teams from Argentina, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. While not officially linked to the Japanese national team, the bulk of the players included in the Sunwolves squad are also members of the national team. However, they dismantled the franchise in the 2020 super rugby season after a failure in the negotiations of signing a new contract for the 2021 season. \nCultural references.\nRugby is occasionally mentioned in Japanese popular culture."

In 96 games that season, O'Brien batted .278 with 4 home runs, 67 RBI, and a 121 OPS+. He played his last MLB game in August.\nO'Brien played for various minor league teams from 1891 to 1896 before retiring from professional baseball.

The venue hosted the Sydney International tournament from 2000 to 2019, the Sydney Tennis Classic in 2022, the ATP Cup in 2020 and 2022, and the United Cup since 2023. The main stadium in the centre is the Ken Rosewall Arena, which has a seating capacity of 10,500, and is capable of hosting multiple sports, including tennis and netball.\nFacilities.\nIn December 2008, the centre court was renamed Ken Rosewall Arena, named in honour of the Sydney-born tennis player and multiple Grand Slam winner Ken Rosewall. The stadium holds 10,500 people. There are also two other show courts in the precinct seating 4,000 and 2,000 spectators respectively, as well as ten other match courts and six practice courts.\nRefurbishment.\nIn January 2019, the New South Wales Government announced a $50.5 million upgrade of the Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre, to improve facilities for players and spectators ahead of the ATP Cup multi-nation tennis tournament, which began being held at the venue in 2020. The biggest change to the venue was the construction of a large permanent roof over Ken Rosewall Arena, allowing play to continue on the arena irrespective of the weather conditions. In addition a hardwood playing surface was added to the floor of Ken Rosewall Arena, giving the venue the capability to host sports such as netball and basketball.\nThe arena was chosen to host the finals matches of the first three editions of the ATP Cup, from 2020 until 2022. The upgrade was completed in time for the 2020 ATP Cup in January.\nSuper Netball clubs the New South Wales Swifts and Giants Netball were to have moved all home matches to Ken Rosewall Arena ahead of the 2020 season. However, only three days before the 2020 season commenced the New South Wales-Queensland border was shut due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing both the Swifts and Giants out of the state and into a Queensland hub; subsequently, neither club played a single home match at the venue in 2020.\nReferences.\nSources"

The first game was played on June 24, 2007. The league was discontinued following its debut season.\nLeague structure.\nThe current league teams are the Team Misgav, Bet Shemesh Blue Sox, Ra'anana Express, Tel Aviv Lightning, Tel Aviv Academy. Former teams include Netanya Tigers, Petach Tikva Pioneers, and Modi'in Miracle. \nThe teams play games at four ballparks. The Yarkon Sports Complex, seating 15,000, in the Baptist Village in Petach Tikva, just outside Tel Aviv, is home to the Ra'anana Express and the Tel Aviv teams. Gezer Field, about halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, is home to the Bet Shemesh Blue Sox. The Misgav Sports Complex is used for the Misgav team.\nin the past, Sportek Baseball Field, in Tel Aviv, was shared by the Tel Aviv Lightning and the Netanya Tigers.\nPlayers.\nThe IBL had 120 players from nine countries in 2007: the United States (77 from 19 states), the Dominican Republic (16), Israel (15), Canada (9), Australia (7), Colombia, Japan, New Zealand, and Ukraine. The league had hoped to be made up of at least 25% Israelis by its fifth year. About 40% of the league was Jewish.\nThe league held tryouts in 2007 in Los Angeles, Massachusetts, Miami, Israel, and The Dominican Republic. Those selected were current and former U.S. minor leaguers, professional baseball players from other countries, and starting college players.\nThe first pick in the draft was infielder Aaron Levin, 21, who played for Cuesta College and was selected by Modi'in. The first players signed were outfielder Dan Rootenberg and pitcher Adam Crabb.\nPitcher Sandy Koufax was the last player chosen in the draft, by the Modi'in Miracle. \"His selection is a tribute to the esteem with which he is held by everyone associated with this league,\" said team manager Art Shamsky.\nAfter the one IBL season, nine players went on to other professional leagues. These nine players were:\n2007 season.\nThe league had an eight-week, 45-game season. Games were seven innings, with a home run hitting contest (a \"home run derby\") to decide a tie. There were two umpires per game, with three on Sunday nights. Most of the umpires were international, although some were Israeli.\nBet Shemesh (29–12; .707), led by hitters Gregg Raymundo and Jason Rees, had the best regular season record in the league, and finished with a 2.5 game lead over Tel Aviv (26–14; .650), led by pitchers Aaron Pribble and Daniel Kaufman.\nOn August 19, in Petach Tikva, Ron Blomberg's Bet Shemesh Blue Sox shut out Art Shamsky's Modi'in Miracle 3–0 in the IBL's inaugural championship game. Californian RHP Rafael Bergstrom (7–2, 2.44) pitched a complete-game shutout for Bet Shemesh, downing Dominican RHP Maximo Nelson (5–3, 3.55 ERA) who pitched for Modi'in.\nHitting.\nCatcher and former Boston Red Sox minor leaguer Eladio Rodriguez of Modi'in was the league batting champion (.461) and had 16 home runs in 102 at bats, and 23-year-old Australian right fielder Jason Rees led the league with 17 home runs and 50 RBIs in 130 at bats. Rodriguez, 28 years old, and Rees, 24 years old, were both subsequently signed in October to minor league deals by the New York Yankees. Third baseman Gregg Raymundo, who hit .292 in 7 minor league seasons and played for the Texas Rangers' and Pittsburgh Pirates' AAA teams, was a close second in batting with a .459 batting average.\nPitching.\nOne of the leading pitchers was Juan Feliciano of Beit Shemesh, who had pitched for the 2005–06 Hiroshima Carp in Japan. He was 7–1, with a 1.97 ERA, and in 50.1 innings gave up only 28 hits while striking out 73. 6' 5\" lefthander Aaron Pribble of Tel Aviv was 7–2, with a league-leading 1.94 ERA.

The Commissioner's Award for Sportsmanship and Character went to Pribble and infielder Brendan Rubenstein (Ra'anana Express). The Commissioner's Award for Distinguished Service was awarded to shortstop Eric Holtz of Bet Shemesh, a player-coach who filled in as player-manager. The award for best pitcher went to Feliciano, and the Most Valuable Israeli Player was pitcher Dan Rothem of Tel Aviv. In a leaguewide vote of the players (referred to as the 'Schnitzel Awards'), Player of the Year was awarded to Leon Feingold.\nManagers.\nAmong the first managers of the IBL were three of the best-known Jewish former major leaguers: Ron Blomberg was the manager of Bet Shemesh. Due to other commitments, Blomberg turned over managerial duties to player/coach Eric Holtz, while Scott Perlman took over as bench coach for several weeks during the middle of the season. Art Shamsky managed Modi'in and Ken Holtzman managed Petach Tikva until he resigned a week before the season ended, and was replaced by Tony Ferrara. In addition, Steve Hertz managed Tel Aviv, Shaun Smith, an Australian, managed Ra'anana, and Ami Baran, an Israeli originally from Chicago, managed Netanya.\nManagement.\nThe League was the brainchild of Larry Baras, a businessman from Boston.\nMartin Berger, President and Chief Operating Officer, was a Miami trial attorney. The league's Director of Baseball Operations was Dan Duquette, former general manager of the Boston Red Sox and Montreal Expos; currently with the Orioles. Berger and Duquette were involved in selecting the inaugural season players. Bob Ruxin was Director of Business Operations; Ruxin has served as vice president of a sports products and management business. Leon Klarfeld was Director of Israeli Operations; he is a resident of Even-Yehuda, and has been involved in Israeli Baseball for over 20 years, was the president of the Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) between 1994 and 2002, and is a certified umpire for the Confederation of European Baseball. Jeremy Baras was the Director of Game (fan) Experience.\nThe Commissioner was Dan C. Kurtzer, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel and Egypt. The league's Board of Advisors included: Bud Selig (Major League Baseball Commissioner), Wendy Selig-Prieb (former Milwaukee Brewers owner), Marshall Glickman (former president of the NBA Portland Trail Blazers and former president of a minor league baseball team), Professor Andrew Zimbalist (baseball economist), Marvin Goldklang (minority owner of the New York Yankees and principal owner of four minor-league teams), Randy Levine (President of the Yankees), and Marty Appel (former NY Yankees public relations director).\nOn November 15, 2007, Kurtzer and nine advisory board members (including Zimbalist, Goldklang, Levine, and Appel) resigned. They commended Baras for having the vision to bring pro baseball to Israel, but in their letter of resignation, summing up the concerns of all, Goldklang and Zimbalist wrote that: \"it has become apparent that the business leadership of the league has ceased to perform in an effective, constructive or responsible manner and has failed to manage its capital and other resources in a manner likely to produce successful results.\" The advisers who resigned said the league was unwilling to provide financial information. Berger, the league president, said: \"They were asking us for things that we didn't have yet. We haven't done our financials for this year.

        "text": "Cricket on 5 is a UK television programme on Channel 5 showing highlights of England's Test cricket, One Day Internationals (ODI) and Twenty20 Internationals (T20I). The programme was produced by Sunset &amp; Vine.\nBackground.\nIn December 2004, it was announced that Channel 4 would lose the broadcasting rights to live broadcasts of Test cricket after the end of the 2005 Ashes, with live coverage being awarded to Sky Sports exclusively. Initially, the England and Wales ECB had announced that they were contemplating sharing the rights between Sky and Channel 4, but ultimately awarded the contract exclusively to Sky Sports.\nConcurrently, the ECB announced that Channel 5 had gained the broadcast rights to highlights of all test, ODI and T20I cricket. However, unlike the coverage by Channel 4, the contract did not include coverage of domestic cricket (County Cricket, or T20 Finals' Day). Channel 5 was the only broadcaster to bid for the rights to the highlights despite not having broadcast cricket previously. In 2012, Channel 5 extended its contract until 2017. This was subsequently extended by a further two years, until 2019, after which highlights and additional rights were transferred to the BBC.\nTeam.\n\"Cricket on 5\" initially took most of the personnel from Channel 4, keeping award-winning anchor Mark Nicholas along with analysts Simon Hughes and Geoffrey Boycott. The commentating team usually included a fourth commentator from the opposing country, for example Ian Bishop when England took on the West Indies and Matthew Hayden when England took on Australia. For the 2009 Ashes series, legendary Australian commentator, Richie Benaud joined the team. Former England captain Michael Vaughan joined the show in 2010. Sunil Gavaskar and Sourav Ganguly joined the team when India toured England in 2018, and Mitchell Johnson and Mike Hussey joined the team for the 2019 Ashes series.\nRunning time.\nInitially, from 2006 to 2011, the programme was broadcast between 7.15pm to 8pm (45 minute running time).\nAfter 2011, the show was broadcast from 7pm to 8pm (60 minute runtime), which allowed for more coverage once advertisement breaks had been accounted for.\nFor a day/night game, coverage was shown at 12am – 1am.\nProduction.\n\"Cricket on 5\" was produced by Sunset &amp; Vine, a specialist sports production company who also produced award-winning live coverage of England Test matches on Channel 4 from 1999 to 2005.\nEnd.\nIn June 2017 it was announced that BBC Sport had secured the rights to be the free-to-air partner of the ECB from 2020. The BBC will cover 11 live matches from The Hundred, 8 matches from the women's domestic T20 competition, 2 Live England Men's T20 Internationals, and 2 Live Women's T20 Internationals. The BBC also secured the rights held by Channel 5 and will cover highlights of England Men's &amp; Women's teams Test Matches, ODI, and T20 internationals alongside live radio rights and clip rights for the BBC Sport website.\nThe final episode of \"Cricket on 5\" highlighted England's win at the last Ashes test of the 2019 Ashes series. The programme ended with all members of the presenting team in front of the camera, thanking the viewers, and ending the association of Channel 5 with cricket. England Captain Joe Root also thanked Channel 5 for their support over 13 years."

The Buller provincial boundary also includes other notable towns such as Reefton, Karamea, Granity, Charleston, Punakaiki and Murchison (Murchison RFC currently compete in the Tasman provincial Union competition).\nHistory.\nBuller was formed in 1894. Buller has played in both the second and third divisions of the former NPC. After the New Zealand Rugby Union (NZRU) restructuring of the NPC in 2006 Buller currently play in the Heartland Championship (effectively the NPC second division). The side has performed with distinction in this competition having made the top tier Meads Cup section twice in the past 3 seasons.\nBuller (often in combination with West Coast) has had some memorable matches against international sides in the past including victory over Australia. There have also been a number of other impressive results against international opposition including the British Lions, South Africa, Tonga, Fiji, Samoa, and various New Zealand representative sides including New Zealand Maori and New Zealand Juniors.\nHistorically Buller were a strong provincial Union particularly in the pre 1960 era and the Union would compete on a level footing with more famous provincial sides such as Canterbury and Wellington. With the formation of the National Provincial Championship (NPC) in 1976 Buller began to struggle as players moved to bigger Unions to further their rugby and work careers. However the Union has experienced a resurgence in fortunes over the last 4 seasons with the representative team performing well in the Heartland Championship.\nClubs.\nBuller Rugby Union is made up of 5 clubs: \nBuller also have 3 secondary schools who compete in matches:\nSquad.\n2018 Squad\nThe 2018 squad will be reduced after a couple of weeks training:\nL Mundy\nJ Best\nR Matangi\nS Eggers\nL Hateley\nJ Loughnan\nA Ellis\nG Duncan\nR Bonisch\nZ Walsh\nC Neilsen\nJ Lepa\nL Brownlee\nK Parata\nK Tetai\nL Watson\nS Godwin\nB Pratt\nD Rusbatch\nL Elley\nJ Walter\nP Foote\nA Stephens\nJ Lash\nR Malneek\nI Ravudra\nM Feso\nP Saukuru\nS Marris\nM Kaloudigibeci\nC Jenkins\nB Collins\nM Wells\nA Tailua\nJ Hands\nH Babbington\nM McLaren\nplus two to be added.\nUnavailable: S Crackett, S Neighbours, A Norton-Taylor.\nPlaying ground.\nThe Buller team's home ground is Victoria Square in Westport.\nBuller in Super Rugby.\nBuller along with Canterbury, Tasman, West Coast, Mid Canterbury and South Canterbury make up the Crusaders Super Rugby franchise.\nChampionships.\nBuller has won one Provincial Championship, the Heartland Championship Lochore Cup in 2012 defeating South Canterbury in the Final.\nIn 2014, Buller went through Round Robin Undefeated progressing to the Meads Cup Final only to fall to Mid Canterbury.\nRanfurly Shield.\nBuller have never held the Ranfurly Shield despite a number of close matches. The best result being in 1949 when Buller drew 6–6 against Otago at Carisbrook, Dunedin. Had the match been played using the modern scoring system, Buller would have won courtesy of scoring more tries than their Otago opposition.\nSeddon Shield.\nEstablished in 1906 in honour of Richard John Seddon, the Seddon Shield is a challenge shield contested by representative teams in the upper South Island. Buller along with Nelson Bays, Marlborough and West Coast currently compete for the shield. Originally the Golden Bay-Motueka Rugby Union and the Nelson Rugby Union also competed for the shield before those unions amalgamated to form Nelson Bays. Buller have held the shield on a number of occasions but Nelson Bays are the current holders. In 2009 Buller lost their Seddon Shield challenge against Nelson Bays by 29–37.\nRundle Cup.\nThe Rundle Cup is contested annually between the Buller and West Coast Unions. It is one of the oldest trophies in NZ rugby.\nThe Rundle Cup was donated to the West Coast provincial union during their Annual General Meeting at the Albion Hotel on 24 May 1911 by William Rundle as a trophy for Buller-West Coast matches. Rundle was a local business man in the mining industry and former player for the Grey Football Club. He later perished on the frontline in France during World War One. The first contest for the cup was held in 1911 in Westport and was won by Buller.\nNotable players.\nAll Blacks.\nBuller has had six players selected for the All Blacks whilst playing their club rugby in Buller:\nAlso:\nOther All Blacks to play for Buller at senior or junior level either before or after their national selection were:\nBuller centurions.\nThe following players have made 100 appearances for Buller:"

At the end of his career with the Packers, he was the team's all-time leader in tackles and was tied with Ray Nitschke for the Packers' career record in interceptions by a linebacker. Anderson was named a second-team player on the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team and was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1996.\nAnderson also played college football as a linebacker and defensive end for the Michigan Wolverines from 1974 to 1977. He was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player in 1976 and a first-team All-American in 1977. In 2009, he became the linebackers coach at Carroll University.\nEarly years.\nAnderson was born in Waukesha, Wisconsin, in 1956. He attended Waukesha South High School where he played both football and basketball.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nAnderson enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1974 and played college football for head coach Bo Schembechler's Wolverines teams from 1974 to 1977. He was a backup outside linebacker as a freshman in 1974. He was converted to a defensive end in 1975 and started one game at that position.\nAs a junior, Anderson started 10 games at defensive end for the 1976 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a 10-2 and allowed opponents to score only 95 points (7.9 points per game). Anderson contributed 65 tackles and three interceptions for the 1976 Wolverines. At the end of the 1976 season, Anderson received the team's Frederick Matthei Award, and he was also selected as a first-team All-Big Ten Conference player.\nAs a senior, Anderson was moved to the outside linebacker position where he started all 12 games for the 1977 Michigan team that compiled a 10-2 and allowed opponents to score only 124 points (10.3 points per game). Anderson tallied 73 tackles, one fumble recovery and one interception for the 1977 team. In 1977, Anderson received the team's Meyer Morton Award and was selected by the Football Writers Association of America as a first-team linebacker on the 1977 College Football All-America Team.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nAnderson was selected by the Green Bay Packers with their second of two first-round selections (26th overall pick) in the 1978 NFL draft (the Packers' first pick being James Lofton). Anderson signed with the Packers and was selected to the NFL's all rookie team in 1978 after intercepting five passes and registering 102 total tackles in 13 games. After breaking his arm in December 1978, Anderson missed the last three games of the 1978 season. He broke his arm again in training camp in 1979 and missed the first nine games of that season. Despite the early injuries, a sports writer in \"The Milwaukee Journal\" in September 1980 wrote that Anderson was the Packers' \"best overall athlete\", a \"complete football player\" who \"doesn't make mental mistakes\" and \"has size and speed and strength\" and who \"possesses all the stuff superstars are made of\" except for \"color.\"\nAnderson ultimately played 12 seasons with the Packers from 1978 to 1989, appearing in 146 games, 140 of them as a starting linebacker. Anderson was selected as the Packers' most valuable defensive player three consecutive years. He totaled 15 fumble recoveries, 25 interceptions, 167 interception return yards and one interception returned for a touchdown. By the end of Anderson's 12-year career, he was the Packers' all-time leader in tackles with 1,020, and was tied with Ray Nitschke for the Packers' career mark in interceptions by a linebacker.\nAnderson was named a second-team player on the NFL 1980s All-Decade Team as selected by voters of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1996.\nLater years.\nUpon retirement, Anderson became a sportscaster for WITI in Milwaukee.

Manchester matches are classified with first-class cricket between 1844 and 1858, after which it was superseded by the county club.\nHistory.\nCricket may not have reached Lancashire until the 18th century. The earliest known reference to cricket being played in the county is in 1781. In 1816, Manchester Cricket Club was founded and soon became the most important side within the county in the same way that Sheffield Cricket Club and Nottingham Cricket Club were in Yorkshire and Nottinghamshire.\nManchester played mostly against opponents from the north of England and 13 of its matches between 1844 and 1858 have first-class status. Four other first-class matches were played between 1849 and 1851 between Lancashire XIs and Yorkshire XIs.\nIn their early years, the club played their cricket at the Crescent in Salford and afterwards at Moss Lane (here a match against an All England was played in the 1840s; it is said that an XI who played a match at Lord's in 1842 were defeated because they bowled underarm) and subsequently on land adjacent to the Manchester Botanical Garden and leased from the Trafford family. In 1856, Sir Humphrey de Trafford identified this land as being an ideal location for the planned Manchester Art and Treasures Exhibition and offered Manchester Cricket Club £500 in compensation for the remainder of their lease. The club, however, insisted on a figure of £1,000 and agreed to vacate the site ahead of the 1857 season, moving to the ground which subsequently became Old Trafford Cricket Ground, the home of Lancashire cricket.\nLancashire County Cricket Club was formally constituted on 12 January 1864 at a meeting of thirteen Lancashire cricket clubs in Manchester. In 1865, the new club joined the County Championship and played its initial first-class match against Middlesex at Old Trafford on 20, 21 and 22 July. The Manchester club was superseded by the county club and ceased to have important match status in its own right."

        "title": "Sheffield Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Sheffield Cricket Club was founded in the 18th century and soon began to play a key role in the development of cricket in northern England. It was the direct forerunner of Yorkshire County Cricket Club and some of the teams fielded by Sheffield were styled Yorkshire. Sheffield generally held first-class status, depending on the quality of their opponents, from 1827 to 1855.\nEarliest cricket in Yorkshire.\nThe earliest known references to cricket in Yorkshire are in 1751. These relate to local matches in Sheffield and to a game on or soon after Monday, 5 August at Stanwick, near Richmond, between the Duke of Cleveland's XI and Earl of Northumberland's XI (the same teams had earlier played in Durham and this is Durham's earliest cricket reference).\nIt is believed that Sheffield Cricket Club was founded soon after that date and it began to play matches against teams from other northern towns, including some inter-county fixtures.\nSheffield cricket.\nSheffield quickly became the main centre for cricket in Yorkshire. In September 1757, a match took place between Wirksworth and Sheffield at Brampton Moor, near Chesterfield. This is the earliest reference to cricket in Derbyshire.\nWilliam White's \"History &amp; General Directory of the Borough of Sheffield\" (1833) has the following information: \"In 1757 we find the Town Trustees attempting the abolition of brutal sports by paying 14s6d to the cricket players on Shrove Tuesday \"to entertain the populace and prevent the infamous practice of throwing at cocks\"\". Mr White does not give the primary source from which he himself derived the information but it would likely be in parish or town records of some kind which may or may not still exist.\nSheffield v. Leeds.\nOn Tuesday, 7 July 1761, the \"Leeds Intelligencer\" (now the \"Yorkshire Post\") announced a game to be played at Chapeltown the following Thursday (9 July) and this is the first game known to have been played in the Leeds area.\nOn Thursday, 5 September 1765, the \"London Chronicle\" reported a \"great match\" on Monday, 26 August: Leeds v Sheffield at Chapeltown Moor, near Leeds. Sheffield won \"with great difficulty\". As this game was highly rated and was reported by a London newspaper, it shows that cricket was well established in Yorkshire only 14 years after it was first reported there.\nSheffield v. Nottingham.\nIn August 1771, the first of many matches between Sheffield and Nottingham was held. This one took place on the Forest Racecourse at Nottingham and is the earliest known reference to cricket in Nottinghamshire and to any team from the county. The result of the game is unknown because \"of a dispute having arisen by one of the Sheffield players being jostled\" and the reports mention a Sheffield player called Osguthorpe who \"kept in batting for several hours together\".\nThis match may tentatively be regarded as the beginning of county-level cricket in the north of England. The Sheffield club was representative of its county in a similar fashion to Nottingham and (much later) Manchester. Although standards of play in the south were probably much higher than in the north at this time, the same scenario can be observed re the Hornchurch, Maidenhead, Chertsey, Dartford and Hambledon clubs in their respective counties.\nIn 1772, the \"Daily Messenger\" carried reports of a match in Sheffield on Monday, 1 June, in which Sheffield defeated Nottingham.\n19th century.\nThe Sheffield club continued to play occasional first-class matches, mainly against other northern clubs. In September 1833 occurred the first use of \"Yorkshire\" as the team name instead of \"Sheffield\". This was in the Yorkshire v Norfolk match at Hyde Park, Sheffield which Yorkshire won by 120 runs. The great Fuller Pilch was still playing for Norfolk. Yorkshire was by now finding star players of its own, especially the fast bowling all-rounder Tom Marsden.\nAlthough the Sheffield and Manchester clubs had met previously, there was a significant development on 23, 24 &amp; 25 July 1849 when the match was called Yorkshire \"versus\" Lancashire at Hyde Park. This was the first match to involve a Lancashire county team and also, therefore, the first \"Roses Match\". Yorkshire won by 5 wickets.\nIn the winter of 1854, the club agreed to build a new ground on land near to Bramall Lane which they were to lease from the Duke of Norfolk for ninety-nine years. The first game played at Bramall Lane on 30 April 1855 between \"The Eleven\" and \"The Twenty-two\" resulted in the senior team losing by an innings and 28 runs.\nOn 7 March 1861, a Match Fund Committee to run Yorkshire county matches was established in Sheffield, which had by then been the home of Yorkshire cricket for nearly 100 years. It was from this fund that Yorkshire County Cricket Club was founded two years later. This was an exact parallel with the foundation of Sussex County Cricket Club from a similar fund (1836–1839).\nOn 8 January 1863, the formation of Yorkshire County Cricket Club was agreed at a meeting of the Sheffield Match Fund Committee in the Adelphi Hotel, Sheffield. The new club was originally based at Bramall Lane and played its first inter-county match against Surrey at The Oval on 4, 5 &amp; 6 June 1863. It was a rain-affected draw, evenly balanced. The foundation of Yorkshire effectively superseded Sheffield, which ceased to be a first-class team in its own right.\nFor the history of Yorkshire cricket since the foundation of the county club, see: Yorkshire County Cricket Club"

        "text": "Henry Van Noye Lucas (September 5, 1857 – November 15, 1910) was a baseball executive in the late 19th century, president of the Union Association during its one season (1884), and owner of the St. Louis Maroons for three seasons (1884–1886).\nBiography.\nLucas was born on September 5, 1857, in St. Louis, Missouri. He was the twelfth and youngest child of James H. Lucas and Marie Emilie (Desruisseaux) Lucas. When his father died in 1873, Henry Lucas inherited $2 million of his $9 million estate. He lived on an estate just outside of the city of St. Louis (now part of the present-day town of Normandy, Missouri) and was educated at Saint Louis University. An all-around sports enthusiast, he enjoyed baseball both as a participant and as a spectator.\nWith the support of other St. Louis investors, in November 1883, Lucas filed papers to incorporate the St. Louis Athletic Association, giving birth to the St. Louis Maroons. In 1884, the 26-year-old Henry became president of the Union Association, a professional baseball major league that operated for only a single season. After the Union Association collapsed, the National League was persuaded to bring the Maroons into the established league, to try to provide some competition for the St. Louis Browns of the American Association. Unfortunately for the Maroons, the Browns were at the peak of their game, winning pennants four straight years (1885–1888). Meanwhile, the Maroons, facing much better competition in the National League, finished well off the National League pace in 1885 and 1886.\nFollowing the 1886 season, the Maroons were sold to the league, which in turn sold it to John T. Brush. Brush moved the team to Indianapolis, where they were renamed the Hoosiers. The Hoosiers folded following the 1889 season.\nOf Lucas, it was noted that \"during the next few years he turned up at a ballpark or otherwise hinted that he might like to return to the game\", but he had to settle instead for employment as a railway clerk with the Vandalia Railroad.\nPersonal life.\nLucas' paternal grandfather was the French-born John Baptiste Charles Lucas, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.\nLucas married Louise (\"Lizzie\") Espenschied in 1880. They had one child, Henry V. Lucas Jr., who was born on February 1, 1881.\nLucas died in 1910 in his home city, of blood poisoning from an ankle injury originally suffered years earlier. Lucas was employed as a street department inspector at the time of his death. One newspaper headline following his death read, \"Famous Sportsman Who Spends Millions in Fruitless Baseball War Dies in Poverty\". He was survived by his son."

        "text": "Pilipinas Basketball (, PB) was the basketball governing body recognized by the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) from March 2006 to February 2007. It was formed to replace the POC-backed Philippine Basketball Federation, Inc. (PBFI), which itself was formed to replace the FIBA-recognized Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP) as the sport's governing body.\nThe BAP was expelled from the POC in 2005 after a series of disagreements. The POC then formed the Philippine Basketball Federation in mid-2005, but failed to get FIBA recognition. The country was banned from participating in FIBA tournaments soon after. The POC tried to form a new association again in 2006, this time involving all of the country's major basketball stakeholders. This organization was simply called Pilipinas Basketball.\nThe structure of the association is similar, but not identical, to that of USA Basketball. It consists of four of the Philippines' major basketball stakeholders – the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA), the Philippine Basketball League (PBL), National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP), as well as Joey Lina, then-president of the BAP, representing the said association.\nLina, however, backed out from the group. Pilipinas Basketball tried to gain FIBA recognition from FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann but was denied, urging them to \"keep the course\".\nBernie Atienza, the sports coordinator of De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde and Management Committee chairman of the NCAA during the formation of Pilipinas Basketball, was named interim President. Bernie Atienza resigned thereafter from the De La Salle-College of Saint Benilde in the middle of CSB's hosting of the NCAA 82nd season and was replaced by Ateneo de Manila's Jun Capistrano.\nPilipinas Basketball was officially dissolved during the Unity Congress held on February 5, 2007. It gave way to the new basketball governing body of the Philippines, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas. It was formed after both PB and BAP signed a memorandum, known as the \"Tokyo Communique\" to form the said organization. After months of continuous bickering, both groups agreed to proceed with the unity congress in accordance with FIBA Secretary-General Patrick Baumann."

He has been part of the Kings organization for four decades and is currently the Kings' television colour commentator.\nPlaying career.\nFox's road to the NHL started in the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League playing for the Ottawa 67's under head coach Brian Kilrea who, coincidentally, played for Los Angeles during their inaugural season. Fox was a dominant scorer for Ottawa and notched a league-best 166 points in 52 games during the 1979-80 season which convinced Los Angeles to use a first-round selection on Fox at the 1980 NHL Entry Draft held at the Montreal Forum.\nFox was able to use his skill and speed to crack the Los Angeles lineup for the 1980-81 season and finished his rookie campaign with a respectable 18 goals and 42 points for a strong Kings team which finished with a 43-24-13 record under head coach Bob Berry. Fox scored his first NHL goal against Gilles Gilbert of Detroit on October 11, 1980.\nFox played a critical role in the tying goal during the stunning Miracle on Manchester game against Edmonton in the 1982 playoffs, by stripping scoring superstar Wayne Gretzky of the puck in the dying moments of the third period before sending it to defenseman Mark Hardy whose point shot was blocked but pounced on by Steve Bozek who swatted the puck past Oilers goaltender Grant Fuhr to even the score at 5-5 after Los Angeles had trailed 5-0 after two periods. \nIn 1984–85, his strongest season statistically, Fox managed over a point a game, finishing with 30-53-83 in 79 games. Knee injuries prematurely derailed his career, forcing him to retire at 29 after the realization his knees no longer allowed him to use the darting speed which had been the foundation of his success throughout his career. His final NHL goal was scored in St. Louis on October 21, 1989, against Blues goaltender Greg Millen.\nPost-playing career.\nSoon after his retirement, Fox was hired as the colour analyst on the Kings' television broadcasts alongside longtime play-by-play man Bob Miller on Fox Sports West/Prime Ticket. Miller and Fox were together for 27 years, including the Kings' first Stanley Cup Finals run in 1993 and Stanley Cup victories in 2012 and 2014. Since the 2017-2018 NHL season, Fox has worked with play-by-play announcer and Brooklyn native, Alex Faust.\nDue to contractual obligations, Miller and Fox were not allowed to air games beyond the first round. However, due to their longstanding popularity in Southern California, the Kings had them recorded their calls of potential Cup-clinching games in 2012 and 2014 for future distribution. \nHe had the honour of being one of the speakers when Miller was honoured with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2006. On January 25, 2016, Fox was rewarded for distinguished achievement in sports broadcasting and inducted into the Southern California Sports Broadcasters Hall of Fame.\nIn 2015, Jim Fox became acting League Commissioner of the LA Kings High School Hockey League, a newly formed league focusing on high school player development and competition. The LA Kings High School Hockey League is designed to continue the growth of ice hockey in Southern California and directly connect the sport to local communities and high schools.\nA love for wines inspired Fox to study Enology through the University of California, Los Angeles between 2006-2008, as well as Winemaking with the University of California at Davis in 2014. He co-founded Patiné Cellars in 2011, which produces single-vineyard designate pinot noir."

        "title": "West Coast Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The West Coast Rugby Football Union, formed in 1890, is the official governing body for rugby union in the Westland County, Hokitika Borough and Greymouth Borough districts, located in the West Coast provincial region of New Zealand, and is affiliated to the New Zealand Rugby Football Union. The West Coast RFU provincial representative team, a founding member of the National Provincial Championship, is based in Greymouth. It plays home matches at John Sturgeon Park (known as Rugby Park until 2018).\nRepresentative rugby.\nThe West Coast team, a semi-professional side that previously played in the second and third divisions of the National Provincial Championship, continues to compete at national provincial level in the second-tier Heartland Championship. In 2015, the team celebrated their 125th Jubilee.\nWest Coast in Super Rugby.\nWest Coast is a constituent RFU of the Crusaders Super Rugby franchise, following the replacement of NPC cup qualification to the Super 10 with a franchise model by the NZRFU. West Coast joined the alliance, led by former Super 10 qualifiers Canterbury, together with the Tasman, Buller, Mid Canterbury and South Canterbury provincial football unions.\nChampionships.\nWest Coast have yet to win a Provincial Championship title in any division, but have finished in the second-division top four for five seasons since the Heartland Championship era began, including finishing as Heartland Championship minor premiers in 2009 (before losing the Meads Cup Grand Final to North Otago).\nRanfurly Shield.\nWest Coast have never held the Ranfurly Shield.\nWest Coast's Ranfurly Shield challenges:\nAll Blacks.\nThere have been eight players selected for the All Blacks whilst playing their club rugby in the West Coast. \nRundle Cup.\nThe Rundle Cup is contested by the West Coast and Buller when they meet in senior fixtures.\nThe Rundle Cup was donated to the West Coast provincial union during their Annual General Meeting at the Albion Hotel on 24 May 1911 by William Rundle as a trophy for West Coast v Buller matches. Rundle was a local business man in the mining industry and former player for the Grey Football Club. He later perished on the frontline in France during World War One. The first contest for the Rundle Cup was held in 1911 in Westport, and it replaced the Molloy Cup as the region’s symbol of rugby supremacy.\nThe first game between the two Unions occurred in 1896 and bragging rights on the Coast now come via the Rundle Cup.\nOf the 37 challenge trophies contested by two provinces in New Zealand rugby it is of the longest continuous existence, it is also the second oldest provincial trophy after the Ranfurly Shield.\nWILLIAM ARTHUR RUNDLE (1874–1918)\nDonor of the Rundle Cup\nWilliam Rundle was born on 24 April 1874 at No Town, a small mining settlement 25 km north-east of Greymouth. His parents, Thomas and Julia Rundle were both born in Cornwall, England, and had come out to New Zealand where Thomas became the storekeeper at No Town from the 1870s. The village also had a hotel and post office. William had three brothers (T.A., C.G., and Edward James), and two sisters, Tryphena who married William Robert Moore in 1913 and lived at Mokau and later in Auckland, and a second sister whose name is unknown but she later became Mrs R.C. Heffernan and lived in Greymouth. A fourth brother, Francis Henry, died in 1892.\nWilliam and his siblings were educated at the local No Town School. When in his early teenage years William was a pupil-teacher at the school and later became a teacher at Taylorville school. In 1893, when aged 20, he was appointed headmaster at Ahaura School and remained there until retiring in 1901 to pursue his interests in mining. \nOn 4 December 1899 William married Adelaine 'Ada' Mary Gough at Ahaura. There was some controversy during his term at Ahaura when parents became concerned that William was acting as a local agent for a life insurance company and they felt he wasn't focusing on his teaching duties. However, the dispute appeared to have been settled amicably. William took part in many community activities and played competition cricket with the local club.\nWilliam and Ada moved to Hokitika in 1901 and their son Francis 'Frank' was born there on 30 September 1901, followed by daughter Adelaine Mary on 15 September 1903. The children, Frank and Ada, took part in musical recitals when the family moved to Greymouth. William played rugby with the local White Star club and in later years was on the management committee of the United rugby club. He played cricket and became secretary of the Grey Cricket Association. In Greymouth William was also active in tennis, cycling and the Masonic Lodge.\nIn addition to his work as a Government Life Insurance Co agent William acted as secretary to several goldmining companies and was a sharebroker and mining agent. \nIn September 1910 William informed the West Coast rugby union that he wished to donate a cup for competition between West Coast and Buller unions. The cup would replace the previous trophy, Molloy Cup, which West Coast now held outright. The Molloy Cup had been donated by Rev. Father Molloy, of Westport, who made the offer in September 1905. The original condition was that the trophy became the property of the winning team that won twice in succession or three times at intervals. However, it was later revised to become three times in succession or five times at intervals. The Molloy Cup results were:\n1905 at Westport Drawn 3–3\n1906 at Greymouth Buller won 9–3\n1907 at Westport Buller won 5–3\n1908 at Greymouth West Coast won 11–4\n1909 at Cape Foulwind West Coast won 16–3\n1910 at Greymouth West Coast won 16–0\nWilliam was 40 years old when World War I broke out in 1914 and even in 1916 when conscription was introduced he was over age for the ballots. Married men over the age of 40 and with children were exempt. He had been involved in military training in Greymouth and in July 1916 was made a temporary 2nd Lieutenant with No. 63 Company in Greymouth. However, felt he had to do his bit for his country and enlisted for service abroad. On 22 December 1916 a Hokitika resident, H.L. Michel, wrote to the Minister of Defence, Mr James Allen, seeking a favourable rank for William:\nThe Hon. Jas. Allen\nWellington,\nWhen I was in Greymouth a few days ago, I learned that Mr W.A. Rundle, who is really a good and competent man, had decided to offer his services for the front although he is a married man with a family.\nHe has a commission in the Territorials, but his 12 months' probation does not expire until June. He has put in an application to the Group Commander, asking to be allowed to put in the balance of the probationary period at Trentham Camp to fully qualify him. I understand the application has been favourably franked by the Group Commander.\nI may mention that Mr Rundle has taken a very active part in establishing a branch of the National Reserve in Greymouth and he is deservedly a popular officer.\nI merely ask you to be good enough to peruse his application, and if it is not contrary to the military policy, an officer at Trentham Camp.\nWith kind remembrances,\nSincerely yours,\nH.L. Michel (signed)\nThe Minister replied saying: \n'I regret to inform you that it will not be possible for Mr Rundle to proceed to Camp as an officer, and complete his twelve months period of probation there, as such action is not sanctioned by Regulations. He should, however, apply for appointment as a probationary N.C.O., and should he be successful in gaining same, he will be provided in Camp with every facility for qualifying for commissioned rank.\nYours faithfully,\n(signed) J. Allen\nMinister of Defence.'\nRundle went into camp on 8 February 1917 and was a corporal until being promoted to sergeant on 15 August, the day he sailed from New Zealand. William's attestation form describes him as a self-employed mining agent, 5 ft 11in tall, 76 kg, fair complexion, blue eyes and light brown hair. His service number was 46905.\nThere was further training in England until he crossed the channel to France on 20 March 1918. He now reverted to corporal serving in the NZ Rifle Brigade. He had a brief spell in hospital and rejoined his unit in the field on 19 April. Five days later he celebrated his 44th birthday while in the trenches. \nCorporal William Rundle's time on the Somme battlefield was brief. He was killed in action on 2 May 1918. His gravestone is at the Euston Road British Cemetery, Colincamps, Somme, France (grave reference: I.J.26)\nClubs.\nWest Coast Rugby Football Union is made up of 7 clubs: "
