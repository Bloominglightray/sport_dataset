        "title": "List of American Football League officials",
        "text": "The American Football League (AFL, 1960–1969) had a unique take on the uniforms of referees, umpires, line judges, field judges and back judges. With their red-orange stripes, black collars and cuffs, and AFL logos on their shirt fronts, sleeves and caps, they were not only more colorful, but easier to see than those of the other league. They were especially unique when seen on color television, which was also on the rise in the 1960s. Both the National Football League and All-America Football Conference had used colored uniforms in the 1940s. Referees wore black caps while all other officials wore red caps. The AFL outfitted their officials in red orange striped until 1968 when, in preparation for the merger, all AFL on field officials began to wear uniforms similar to those worn in the NFL.\nIn his book COLORS, Jim Finks Jr., son of Pro Football Hall-of-Famer Jim Finks, Sr., shows the original uniform of AFL official Jack Reader, who was a back judge in the first AFL game in 1960 and in both the first and third AFL-NFL World Championship games. Reader was in an iconic January 20, 1969 \"Sports Illustrated\" photo, signaling a touchdown after Matt Snell's 4-yard plunge against the Colts.\nThe following list indicates men who were American Football League on-field officials: an important but seldom-credited part of the game. Nine, as shown in the list below, officiated in the American Football League for the entire ten years of its existence, 1960 through 1969. They were: Ben Dreith (FJ, R); Bob Finley (U, R); Hugh Gamber (BJ, FJ); Elvin Hutchison (HL); John McDonough (R); Walt Parker (U); Jack Reader (BJ, R); Al Sabato (HL) and George Young (U).\nThere were 34 on-field officials in the AFL in 1969, the league's last year of play. 33 of them were good enough to continue to officiate after the merger. One of them was Cal Lepore, now known as \"the father of instant replay\". He also promulgated the use of replay to review the accuracy of on-field calls, for the evaluation of officials. Another important link from the American Football League to today's professional football.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Ice bowling",
        "text": "Ice bowling is a variant of traditional ten-pin bowling in that it is played on ice, usually outdoors.\nHistory.\nOnce considered a winter novelty associated with winter festivals throughout the northern United States and Canada, ice bowling is slowly growing into a more established sport in areas with hibernal climates. For instance, in February 2009, the World Ice Bowling Championships took place in Anchorage, Alaska as part of the Anchorage Fur Rendezvous. Such events attest to the rising significance of the fledgling sport.\nGame Play.\nIce bowling is strictly an amateur sport and no professional sport association exists for the game yet. Ice bowling lanes are often cleared from natural bodies of ice such as lakes, rivers, or streams, or are created from a field of compacted snow by drizzling with water and allowing the field to freeze solid in due course, a process similar to creating an improvised ice skating rink. Scoring, game format, and general rules and regulations parallel 10 pin bowling quite closely. However, similar to bumper bowling, hay or straw bails are often used in place of gutters, allowing the bowling ball to ricochet its way down the bowling lane. Another notable divergence from modern 10 pin bowling is the lack of automatic ball return mechanisms, necessitating a human lane attendant at the end of the ice lane in order to reset the bowling pins after the bowling ball is put into play, and additionally to return the ball to the hurler. A lane attendant is also responsible for grooming the ice between games in order to ensure a uniform surface free of shavings or impediments. Since the game is often played in inhospitable conditions, with snow, sleet, and hail not unheard of during day-to-day game play, several layers of winter outerwear, including parkas, gloves, scarves, ushanka, and mukluks would be common for players to attire themselves in while engaging in the sport."

In 2014, SK Telecom T1 K followed their success through in the OGN winter season, winning the tournament without dropping a single game. They would then go on to win All-Star Paris 2014. However, their Winter season success did not follow through and after the Spring and Summer seasons, SKT T1 K failed to qualify for the 2014 World Championship. In the following offseason, Riot Games changed the team regulations so that each organizations may only have one team participating in each league. This led to the merger of SKT T1 K and SKT T1 S, and the subsequent departures of Impact and Piglet for the NA LCS. The new team would compete under the name SKT T1.\nAt the 2015 World Championship, SKT won the title while losing only one game in the finals for a record of 15–1 over the course of the tournament.\nSKT team started off the 2016 Season by winning the LCK Spring Split. With this victory, SKT was guaranteed a spot in the 2016 Mid-Season Invitational. At that point in time, MSI was the only major international tournament they had yet to win. They were heavily favored coming into the tournament, but were initially unable to perform up to their usual standards, unexpectedly losing several games in the group stage. However, they managed to turn things around during the elimination round and eventually clinched the title by sweeping the North American team, Counter Logic Gaming, in the finals. SKT placed third in the 2016 LCK Summer Split, but still qualified for the 2016 World Championship through circuit points.

After a 5–1 group stage, SKT narrowly defeated Misfits and Royal Never Give Up in the quarterfinals and semifinals, respectively, before facing Samsung Galaxy in a repeat of the previous year's final. Despite being favourites going into the game, Samsung Galaxy swept SKT 3–0, ending their domination at the World Championship.\nSKT finished fourth in the 2018 Korea Regional Finals, failing to qualify for the 2018 World Championship.\nIn April 2019, SKT won the LCK Spring Split.

In the playoffs, T1 won its tenth LCK title, defeating Gen.G 3–1 in the finals. On the international stage, T1 finished as the runners-up of the 2022 Mid-Season Invitational, losing in the final to Royal Never Give Up. The team also finished as the runners-up at the 2022 League of Legends World Championship after losing 3–2 to DRX in the final. The team had qualified for the tournament as the second seed from the LCK by the virtue of having the most Championship Points.\nIn the 2023 LCK Spring Split, T1 qualified for the playoffs as the first seed, posting a 17–1 record as all five members of the roster were chosen for the All-LCK First Team, a first in LCK history. The team won every series to advance to the finals, qualifying for the 2023 Mid-Season Invitational after defeating Gen.G in the upper bracket semifinals. T1 lost the Spring Split title against the same opponent in a rematch of the 2022 LCK Summer 2022 finals, as Gen.G won the match 3–1. T1 was then defeated 3–2 by JD Gaming and 3–1 by Bilibili Gaming to exit the Mid-Season Invitational at the loser-bracket final.

        "text": "The 2018 Asian Games ( or \"Asian Games 2018\"), officially known as the 18th Asian Games and also known as Jakarta-Palembang 2018 or Indonesia 2018, was a continental multi-sport event that was held from 18 August to 2 September 2018 in Jakarta and Palembang.\nFor the first time, the Summer Asian Games were co-hosted by two regions; the Indonesian capital of Jakarta (which was hosting the Games for the first time since 1962), and Palembang, the capital of South Sumatra province. Events were held in and around the two cities, including venues in Bandung and the provinces of West Java and Banten. The opening and closing ceremonies of the Games were held at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta. The Games were originally awarded to Hanoi, Vietnam, but withdrew in 2014 due to budgetary concerns and other factors.\nSeveral non-Olympic events were trimmed from the event programme, but several new disciplines being introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo (including 3-on-3 basketball) were added. Esports and canoe polo were also contested as demonstration sports.\nChina led the medal tally for the tenth consecutive time. North and South Korea fielded a unified team during the opening ceremony and selected events, and also won their first-ever gold medal as a unified team at a multi-sport event. 6 world, 18 Asian and 86 Asian Games records were broken during the Games, while Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee was announced as the most valuable player.\nBidding process.\nThe OCA originally planned to hold these Games in 2019 rather than 2018, so that Asian Games would be held exactly a year before the 2020 Summer Olympics instead of the same year as the 2018 Winter Olympics. After they were awarded to Indonesia, the OCA backtracked on these plans and kept the Games in 2018, so that they would not interfere with the 2019 Indonesian general election.\nInitial bidding.\nHanoi, Vietnam was originally selected to be the host after they won the bid against two other candidates, Surabaya and Dubai. They were awarded the winning bid on 8 November 2012, with 29 votes against Surabaya's 14 votes. Dubai pulled out at the last minute, instead announcing their intention to focus on future bids. The UAE's National Olympic Committee's vice-president denied any pullout and claimed that Dubai \"did not apply for hosting 2019 Asian Games\" and had \"only considered\" doing so.\nHowever, in March 2014, there were some concerns about Vietnam's ability to host. These included concerns over whether the anticipated budget of US$150 million was realistic. There were claims that the government would eventually spend over US$300 million. In addition, critics were concerned that several stadiums built in conjunction with the 2003 Southeast Asian Games had not been utilized since. Former chairman of the Vietnam Olympic Committee Ha Quang Du also claimed that hosting the Asian Games would not boost tourism in Vietnam.\nOn 17 April 2014, Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng officially announced Hanoi's withdrawal from hosting, citing unpreparedness and economic recession as the main reasons for the withdrawal, saying \"they have left the country unable to afford the construction of facilities and venues\". Many Vietnamese people supported the decision to withdraw. No penalty was imposed for the withdrawal.\nAppointment of Jakarta and Palembang.\nAfter Hanoi's withdrawal, the OCA said that Indonesia, China, and the United Arab Emirates were major candidates under consideration to host. Indonesia was widely regarded as a favourite, since Surabaya was the runner-up of the previous bid, and willing to do so if selected. The Philippines and India expressed their interest about hosting the Games, but India failed to submit a late bid because it was unable to get an audience with Prime Minister Narendra Modi after being given an extended deadline by the OCA.\nOn 5 May 2014, the OCA visited several Indonesian cities, including Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung, and Palembang. At this time Surabaya decided to drop their bid to host the Games and instead focus on hosting the already scheduled 2021 Asian Youth Games. On 25 July 2014, during a meeting in Kuwait City, the OCA appointed Jakarta as the host of the Games with Palembang as the supporting host. Jakarta was chosen because of its well-equipped sports facilities, adequate transportation networks, and other facilities such as hotels and lodging for guests. On 20 September 2014, Indonesia signed the host city contract, and was ceremonially appointed host during the closing ceremony of the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon. An organising committee was formed soon after the appointment.\nDevelopment and preparations.\nCosts.\nBy 2015, the central government had allocated a budget of IDR 3 trillion (US$224 million) to prepare for the Games, with regional administrations also expected to supply some part of the funding. By July 2018, the budget allocation for the Games had been reported to be IDR 6.6 trillion (US$450 million) including IDR 869 billion (US$59 million) from sponsorships. However, on 2 September 2018, the Finance Minister of Indonesia Sri Mulyani disclosed that IDR 8.2 trillion was financed by 2015–2018 state budget, which was used by the local organizing committee, namely the Indonesia Asian Games Organizing Committee (INASGOC) led by Erick Thohir, for all preparations, opening, organising, and finalizing the implementation of the 2018 Asian Games. The total cost of arranging the Games is estimated about US$3.2 billion, of which $2.4 billion being spent on infrastructure development associated with the games.\nVolunteers.\nPhase 2 volunteering programme of Jakarta-Palembang 2018 Asian Games began on 18 December 2017 with target of 13,000 volunteers being set. The volunteers wore clothing which included jacket, polo shirts and trousers which they collected from the Uniform Distribution and Accreditation Centre at the Sports and Recreation Arena in East Jakarta. Volunteers also wore accreditation card which gain them access to specific venues and buildings around the site.\nTorch relay.\nOn 10 May 2018, 100 days before their opening, the Asian Games torch was unveiled. The design was inspired by the golok and skin — traditional weapons originating from Jakarta and Palembang.\nThe torch relay began at the Major Dhyan Chand National Stadium in New Delhi, host of the 1st Asian Games, on 15 July 2018. The flame was generated from a parabolic mirror directed at the sun. On 18 July 2018, a ceremony took place in Brahma field by the 9th century Hindu temple of Prambanan near Yogyakarta, where the torch's flame from India were fused together with an Indonesian natural eternal flame taken from Mrapen, Central Java. Subsequently, the Torch Relay Concert were performed marking the start of torch relay throughout the country.\nThe relay travelled through 54 cities in 18 provinces in Indonesia, including host cities. The relay covered a total distance of . The relay finished on 17 August, the 73rd anniversary of the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence, at the National Monument in Jakarta before being carried into the opening ceremony at Gelora Bung Karno Stadium the next day.\nMarketing.\nEmblem and mascot.\nThe initial emblem for the 2018 Asian Games was first unveiled on 9 September 2015, in celebration of the country's National Sports Day. On 27 December 2015, the Games' mascot, Drawa, was unveiled by vice president Jusuf Kalla. Both the emblem and mascot were a stylized rendition of the \"cenderawasih\", a rare species of bird in Indonesia.\nThe designs were widely criticised for their outdated appearance, and Drawa was also criticised for having little connection to Indonesian culture and history (with some Indonesians joking that the mascot looked more like a chicken than a \"cenderawasih\"). Organisers ultimately withdrew the original emblem and mascot, and announced an open call for a new design. Out of 60 submissions, the new emblem — entitled \"Energy of Asia\" — was unveiled on 28 July 2016. The new emblem was modelled upon the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, and was intended to symbolise unity among Asian countries.\nThree new mascots were also unveiled: Bhin Bhin, a greater bird-of-paradise; Atung, a Bawean deer; and Kaka, a Javan rhinoceros. They represent the Eastern, Central, and Western regions of Indonesia, as well as strategy, speed and strength. The mascots' outfits reflect traditional textiles; Bhin Bhin wears a vest with Asmat pattern details, Atung wears a \"sarong\" with \"batik tumpal\" patterns, and Kaka wears a Palembang \"songket\" with floral patterns. Their names were derived from the national motto of Indonesia, \"Bhinneka Tunggal Ika\" (\"Unity in Diversity\").\nMedals.\nThe medal designs were unveiled in July 2018, featuring batik designs reflecting the unity and diversity of Indonesian and Asian culture.\nPromotion.\nOn 18 August 2017, simultaneous events were held at Jakarta's National Monument and Palembang's Kuto Besak Fort to mark the one-year milestone before the Games. The event in Jakarta was attended by president Joko Widodo, and featured performances by Taeyeon and Kim Hyo-yeon of K-pop group Girls' Generation. Countdown clocks were unveiled at the Selamat Datang Monument and in front of Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium.\nSeveral fun run events were held in Asian countries to promote the Games, beginning with Lahore, Pakistan in December 2017.\nMerchandising.\nThe games' merchandises and licensing products, which included mascot stuffed toys and other items, were sold in stores across Jakarta (including the Super Store at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex) from the end of 2017 to the end of September 2018.\nMusic.\nThe official theme song of the Games, \"Meraih Bintang\" (\"Reach for the Stars\"), was performed by Via Vallen. The song was included in a larger , released on 13 July 2018 and featuring various Indonesian musicians.\nAs part of an effort to appeal younger spectators, the Indonesian-Japanese idol group JKT48 was signed to perform at some of the Games' venues, such as jet ski, softball, and volleyball. They performed in select events between 19 August and 1 September in a group consisted of eight members from each of its teams.\nPhilatelic.\nAs part of creating a memorable and collectible item, the Indonesian postal service Pos Indonesia issued a philatelic collectible items of the 2018 Asian Games series. These items were issued on 18 January 2018 and 18 August 2018.\nVenues.\nThe Games used a mix of new and existing venues in Jakarta and South Sumatra (with organizers aiming to reuse existing facilities and infrastructure, such as those built for the 2011 Southeast Asian Games, to help control costs), as well as Jakarta's neighbouring provinces of Banten, and West Java. Venues were divided into four clusters, with three in Jakarta and its surrounding areas and one in Palembang.\nJakarta.\nThe Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex in Jakarta hosted 13 events. The 56-year-old Main Stadium was refurbished for the Games, replacing its existing bleachers and seating with an all-seater design (reducing its capacity to 77,193), and adding new sound systems and LED lighting among other enhancements.\nThe Jakarta International Velodrome at Rawamangun in East Jakarta was rebuilt, at a cost of US$40 million for cycling, badminton, futsal, basketball, and wrestling. The Jakarta International Equestrian Park at Pulomas underwent a US$30.8 million renovation, with a capacity of 1,000, 100 stables, lodging for athletes, and other amenities.\nPalembang.\nJakabaring Sport City was used as an event site. While there were preliminary plans to increase the size of Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium from 36,000 to 60,000 seats, they were shelved. The site still underwent some renovations, including also being converted from bleachers to an all-seater. A new 40-lane bowling alley was constructed on the complex, as well as eight additional tennis courts. The length of the canoeing and rowing venue in Jakabaring Lake was extended to 2,300 meters, while new rowing facilities and a tribune were built on the lake shore. Other existing venues which was used for Games were also renovated, including Ranau Sports Hall as sepak takraw venue.\nAthletes' villages.\nA 10-hectare athletes' village was constructed in Jakarta's Kemayoran district, with 7,424 apartments in 10 towers, and a total capacity of 22,272. A second athletes' village was built at Jakabaring Sports City at Palembang, which housed 3,000 athletes and officials.\nTransport.\nAs part of the Games preparation, the construction of the Jakarta MRT and Jakarta LRT was accelerated, though neither were ready for general commercial operation at the time of the opening ceremonies. A line of Jakarta LRT connected the athletes' village at Kemayoran in Central Jakarta to the Velodrome at Rawamangun in East Jakarta. City bus operator TransJakarta added 416 buses to serve the officials, and also provide free rides on selected days during the Games.\nPalembang upgraded their transportation facilities ahead for the Games by building 25 kilometres of the Palembang Light Rail Transit from Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport to Jakabaring Sports City which opened for public use in July 2018. Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin II International Airport is expanding its existing arrival and departure terminals to increase its capacity and also connecting the airport with the light rail transit (LRT) terminal by building a skybridge. Other transportation facilities such as toll roads, flyovers, and bridges will be also built in and around the city.\nThe Games.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony started at 19:00 Western Indonesian Time (UTC+7) on Saturday, 18 August 2018. Wishnutama, then-CEO of Indonesian TV network NET. was the creative director for the ceremony. The ceremony stage showcased a towering 26 meter-high mountain with a waterfall as its background, accompanied by Indonesian plants and flowers. North and South Korea delegates marched together under one unified flag of Korea, which marked the first time both countries did so in the Asian Games after 12 years.\nThe games was officially opened by the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo.\nSports.\nIn March 2017, the Olympic Council of Asia initially announced that the Games would feature 484 events in 42 sports, including the 28 permanent Olympic sports contested at the 2016 Summer Olympics, the five additional sports that will be contested at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, as well as events in other non-Olympic sports. In April 2017, the OCA approved reductions in the programme in response to cost concerns; belt wrestling, cricket, kurash, skateboarding, sambo, and surfing were dropped from the programme, and there was to be a reduced number of competitions in bridge, jet ski, jujitsu, paragliding, sport climbing, taekwondo (in particular, all non-Olympic weight classes), and wushu. These changes reduced the total number of events to 431.\nThe final programme was unveiled in September 2017, increasing it to 462 events in 40 sports (61 disciplines) as the second-largest programme in Asian Games history. Additional disciplines being introduced at the 2020 Summer Olympics were also added, including 3x3 basketball and BMX freestyle.\nFor the first time in Asian Games history, esports and canoe polo were contested as demonstration sports in the Games. Six video game titles, most notably Pro Evolution Soccer 2018, were featured in the esports events.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nAll 45 members of the Olympic Council of Asia participated in the games. North Korea and South Korea competed as a unified team in some events under the name \"Korea\" (COR), and marched together under the Korean Unification Flag during the opening and closing ceremonies. With a gold medal in the Women's 500 metre dragon boat competition, a unified team won their first-ever gold medal in a multi-sport event.\nOriginally set to compete as Independent Asian Athletes, the Kuwaitis were allowed to compete under their own flags just two days before the opening ceremony.\nBelow is a list of all the participating NOCs. The number of competitors per delegation is indicated in brackets.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe closing ceremony started at 19:00 Western Indonesia Time (UTC+7) on Sunday, 2 September 2018 and ended at 21:25. In addition to local artists and a Chinese segment, the South Korean boybands Super Junior and iKon, and Indian singer Sidharth Slathia performed in the ceremony. Mayor of Hangzhou Xu Liyi received the Games flag for the 2022 Games from Jakarta Governor Anies Baswedan and South Sumatra Governor Alex Noerdin.\nMedal table.\nChina led the medal table for the tenth consecutive time. Korea claimed their first gold medal at the Games in the canoeing women's traditional boat race 500 m event. A total of 37 NOCs won at least one medal, 29 NOCs won at least one gold medal and 9 NOCs failed to win any medal at the Games.\nThe top ten ranked NOCs at these Games are listed below.\nBroadcasting.\nInternational Games Broadcast Services (IGBS), a joint venture between Host Broadcast Services (HBS) and IMG Media was appointed by the organiser in July 2017 to serve as the host broadcaster for these Games. Involving 37 live production units, it distributed 2,400 hours of the Games content to its international rights holders. The International Broadcast Centre was constructed in Jakarta Convention Center, with a smaller one constructed at the Palembang cluster.\nConcerns and controversies.\nBefore the Games, authorities in Indonesia were confident both host cities would be ready for the Games although they have had only four years to prepare rather than the usual six after stepping in to fill the gap when Vietnam, whose city of Hanoi was originally chosen to host these Games by the Olympic Council of Asia, dropped out in 2014 citing concerns over costs. On top of that, work in both host cities was delayed throughout 2015 because government funding was not immediately available.\nVarious concerns from traffic congestion problems, series of terror attacks, which local police claimed is a pre-Asian Games crackdown on terror suspects and petty street criminals, and already-provoked Indonesian fans at the venue.\nJakarta struggled with air pollution and river pollution problems. River pollution revealed where authorities covered a foul-smelling river near the athletes' village with black nylon mesh over fears it will be an eyesore at the showpiece event. Governor of Jakarta at that time, and the Indonesian Environment and Forestry Ministry quickly relieved the issues by various solutions.\nA doping case from a Turkmen wrestler was recorded, which jeopardize the sport's existence for future Games."

There is free movement between the two parts of Saint Martin/Sint Maarten.\nGoverning body.\nThere are two governing bodies: the French Rugby Federation and the Netherlands Antilles Rugby Federation\nHistory.\nRugby was introduced to Saint Martin by the French who colonised the area. More talented players tend to leave for Metropolitan France.\nThere have been occasional games against sides from the other Caribbean islands. Most of its rugby contacts are either with them, or with France itself.\nSaint Martin had an annual rugby tournament. Anguilla Eels RFC were finalists in the Saint Martin tournament in November 2006 and semi finalists in 2007. Like many small islands, Saint Martin has a small population, which makes rugby development more difficult\nThe main sport is association football. On January 1, 2019 the population of the entire island was 73,606 inhabitants, 41,117 of whom lived on the Dutch side, and 32,489 on the French side. There are two main settlements, Marigot, and Philipsburg. RC Les Archiball and the St Martin Rugby Union are the two clubs in the French territory."

        "text": " \nOffside is a minor foul in gridiron football caused when a player crosses the line of scrimmage ahead of the snap of the ball. The penalty associated with the infraction is the advancing of the ball five yards and a replay of the down.\nHistory.\nDefinition.\nIn gridiron football, offside is a foul in which a player is on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. The foul occurs simultaneously with the snap.\nOffside is committed by the defense when a defensive player crosses the line of scrimmage before the ball is snapped. In the case of an offside foul, play is not stopped, and the foul is announced at the conclusion of the play, giving the offense a free play because the non-offending team can choose whether to accept the result of the play or accept the five yards gained by the penalty.\nAlthough an offside foul is usually committed by the defense, if an offensive player lines up in the neutral zone, an offside foul will be called against the offense. An offside foul will also be called if the ball snapper advances past the neutral zone before snapping the ball.\nIn high school games played under the NFHS ruleset, the term \"offside\" is not used; rather the foul is referred to as encroachment and causes the ball to remain dead. However, the penalty remains five yards, the same as other rule codes.\nPenalty.\nPrior to 1925, a call of offside against a defensive unit brought with it an automatic first down in addition to a five-yard advancement of the ball for the offense. However, a December 1924 meeting of the Football Coaches' Association of America spurred a change of rules for the 1925 season eliminating the provision for an automatic first down, while leaving the five yard penalty intact.\nThe penalty for violation remains five yards at most levels of professional and amateur play."

Its headquarters are in Ra'anana.\nIn 2011, Peter de Villiers, coach of the South African national rugby team, and Oregan Hoskins, president of the South African Rugby Union, visited Israel and met with Israeli national team players. The coach of the Springboks conducted a training session on the rugby field at Kibbutz Yizrael.\nIn 2011, the Israel Olympic Committee backed the seven-a-side game as a preferred team sport ahead of the game's introduction to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\nThe Israeli women's team is ranked 21st in Europe."

        "text": "The men's foil was one of seven fencing events on the Fencing at the 1924 Summer Olympics programme. It was the sixth appearance of the event, which had not been on the programme in 1908. The competition was held from Monday July 1, 1924, to Thursday July 4, 1924. 49 fencers from 17 nations competed. Nations were limited to four fencers each, down from eight in 1920. The event was won by Roger Ducret of France, the nation's third victory in the men's foil. His countryman Philippe Cattiau finished second for the second consecutive Games; Cattiau and Ducret (bronze in 1920) became the second and third men to win multiple medals in the event. Maurice Van Damme earned Belgium's first medal in the men's foil with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1908 (when there was a foil display only rather than a medal event). Three of the 1920 finalists returned: silver medalist Philippe Cattiau and bronze medalist Roger Ducret of France, along with eighth-place finisher Ivan Osiier of Denmark (competing in the Games for the fourth time of his eventual seven). Other notable Olympic veterans included 1912 sixth-place finisher Edgar Seligman and eighth-place finisher Robert Montgomerie of Great Britain. A dispute in the team foil event resulted in the Italian team withdrawing from the fencing tournament without competing in the individual foil—the second time in three Games that an Italy–France matchup was prevented by a dispute (France had withdrawn from the 1912 fencing tournament over a rules dispute).\nArgentina, Poland, Portugal, and Uruguay each made their debut in the men's foil. The United States made its fifth appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 competition.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a five-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to five touches. Standard foil rules were used, including that touches had to be made with the tip of the foil, the target area was limited to the torso, and priority determined the winner of double touches.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced.\nRound 2.\nThe top three fencers in each pool advanced.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced.\nSemifinals.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced."

        "text": "The Horizon League men's basketball conference tournament is held annually at the end of the men's college basketball regular season. The tournament has been played each year since 1980. The winner of the tournament is designated the Horizon League Tournament Champion and receives the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA men's basketball tournament. The finals of the tournament are typically among the first held before the field for the NCAA tournament is announced.\nHistory and tournament format.\nThrough 2002, the entire tournament was hosted at a single venue. From 2003 through 2015, all first-round matches were played at the home court of the higher-seeded team involved. Hosting rights for the quarterfinals and semifinals were awarded to the winner of the regular season championship. The championship game was played at the home arena of the higher remaining seed. This format rewarded the regular-season champion and runner-up with a double-bye into the semifinals. The regular-season champion received the added benefit of home-court advantage in the semifinals, plus a home-court final if it won its semifinal.\nBeginning in 2009, the Horizon League secured an entitlement sponsorship of its men's and women's basketball tournaments with Speedway SuperAmerica, a major gas and convenience store chain throughout the midwest United States, officially changing the name of the tournaments to \"The Speedway Horizon League Men's/Women's Basketball Championship\".\nFrom 2016 to 2019, the Horizon League tournament was held in Detroit under a five-year deal, beginning at Joe Louis Arena, adding the women's tournament in 2017 (with both events marketed under the title \"Motor City Madness\"), and moving to the newly-opened Little Caesars Arena beginning in 2018.\nHowever, the contract with Detroit was ended a year early; the league reopened bidding for the men's and women's tournaments in 2018, with the new contract taking effect with the 2019–20 season. On January 25, 2019, the conference announced that Indianapolis would host the men's and women's semifinals and final from 2020 to 2022, with Indiana Farmers Coliseum as the venue. In 2022, the deal was extended through 2026.\nPostseason appearances.\nHorizon League members past and present have made several Sweet 16, Elite Eight, and Final Four appearances. Charter member Loyola also won the 1963 NCAA tournament."

        "title": "Wichita Aviators (baseball)",
        "text": "The Wichita Aviators were a minor league baseball team based in Wichita, Kansas from 1905 to 1933. Wichita was a member of the Western Association (1905–1908) and Western League (1909–1933).\nHistory.\nThe club played mostly in the Western League. However, the club began play as the Wichita Jobbers, a member of the Western Association. The Jobbers played in the Western Association from 1905 to 1908, winning the league championship in 1905 and 1907. The 1907 Jobbers were recognized as one of the 100 greatest minor league teams of all time. The Jobbers then moved to the Western League, where they played until midway through their 1911 season. That year, the team relocated to Pueblo, Colorado, where they finished out the year as the Pueblo Indians.\nHowever, a team representing Wichita was fielded in 1912 to compete in the Western League. The Wichita Witches played continuously in the league until 1916. The team finished their 1916 season in Colorado Springs, Colorado as the Colorado Springs Millionaires, before returning to Wichita in 1917. The team was again renamed the Jobbers from 1918 to 1920, before retaking the Witches moniker as they won their third league title, the first in the Western League, in 1921. From 1923 to 1926, the club was renamed the Wichita Izzies, and they took the name the Wichita Larks from 1927 to 1929.\nIn 1919, Jobbers outfielder Joe Wilhoit posted the longest hitting streak in professional baseball history. The 33-year-old, who had spent much of the previous three seasons in the majors, hit safely in 69 consecutive games. Wilhoit's streak lasted from June 14 to August 19, during which he was 153-for-297 for a .515 batting average. He would lead the Western League with a .422 batting average and 211 hits before finishing the season (and his big league career) with the Boston Red Sox.\nMultiple Izzies players had or would go on to have major league experience.\n1923: Johnny Butler, Joe Casey, Jocko Conlan, Howie Gregory, Ed Hovlik, Ernie Maun, Hugh McMullen, Paul Musser\n1924: Fred Beck, Butler, Archie Campbell, Chuck Corgan, Gregory, Hovlik, McMullen, Musser\n1925: Campbell, Chet Chadbourne, Corgan, Fred Graf, Gregory, Raymond Haley, Don Hankins, Hovlik, McMullen, Ray Morehart, Ken Penner, Bill Sweeney\n1926: Jack Berly, Fred Brickell, Campbell, Pete Compton, Bill Doran, Gregory, Haley, Sweeney\nIn 1920, the club was renamed the Wichita Aviators, and from 1930 to 1931 they became an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates. In 1931, the Aviators won their second Western league title, and fourth overall league title. The Aviators affiliation changed in 1932 from the Pirates to the Chicago Cubs.\nFormer Aviators include Indian Bob Johnson, Woody Jensen, Vern Kennedy, Jack Mealey, and Hall of Famer Arky Vaughan.\nIn 1933 the Wichita Aviators became the Wichita Oilers. After beginning the year 6–13, the club moved to Muskogee, Oklahoma, where they became the Muskogee Oilers. Overall the Oilers were 26–95, one of the worst records ever posted in the Western League. The club was just 20–82 after leaving Wichita, and only went 8–57 in the second half. The Oilers did not return in 1934 and Wichita would not have another team until the Wichita Indians began play in 1950.\nReferences.\nPhoto of 1912 Team https://www.newspapers.com/clip/43637540/"

        "text": "The Wisconsin Badgers women's ice hockey team is the hockey team that represents the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin.\nHistory.\nOn October 8, 1999, the Bulldogs played the Wisconsin Badgers in the first ever Women's WCHA conference game at the Kohl Center in Madison, WI. It was the highest attended game of the season (3,892) and resulted in an 8–1 defeat of the Badgers.\nIn 2006, the Wisconsin Badgers became the first team outside the state of Minnesota to win the Women's Frozen Four championship. The Badgers defeated the defending champions, the Minnesota Golden Gophers, by a score of 3–0 at Mariucci Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nOn January 28, 2012, the Wisconsin Badgers broke the NCAA women's hockey attendance record for the third consecutive year with 12,402 fans in attendance. The game was part of a two-game sweep of the Bemidji State Beavers. The previous record for most fans to watch a women's college hockey game at the Kohl Center was 10,668. That record was set on January 29, 2011.\nOn November 6, 2016, Ann-Renee Desbiens achieved career shutout number 44, breaking Noora Raty’s record for most NCAA career shutouts.\nAn 8-2 win on December 4, 2016 against their rivals, the Minnesota Golden Gophers resulted in a career milestone. Playing in front of a sellout crowd at Labahn Arena, Sarah Nurse scored a hat trick, becoming the first player in program history to score a hat trick against Minnesota. It marked the first time that Wisconsin scored eight goals in a game since October 11, 2015 against Ohio State, as five different Badgers scored at least one goal.\nOn January 14, 2017 Wisconsin once again broke its own NCAA women's hockey single-game attendance record of 13,573 which was set in 2014. The Badgers defeated St. Cloud State 2-0 at their at Fill the Bowl event in front of a crowd of 15,359.\nAppearing in the 2021 NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Tournament versus the Northeastern Huskies, Daryl Watts scored the game-winning goal in a 2-1 overtime win. With the win, the program captured its sixth national championship, all with Mark Johnson as head coach.\nOn March 19, 2023 the Badgers became the lowest seed to win a NCAA women's hockey tournament as Wisconsin knocked off top-seeded Ohio State, 1-0, to claim the program's record-breaking seventh NCAA title at AMSOIL Arena in Duluth, Minn. Kirsten Simms scored the lone goal of the game and Cami Kronish stopped all 31 shots she faced en route to being named the Most Outstanding Performer of the Tournament.

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics – Men's vault",
        "text": "The men's vault competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29, 31 and August 4 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. There were 71 competitors from 19 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have to up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Lou Yun of China, in the nation's debut in the Games.\nWith four silver medalists, the event produced the only four-way tie in the Olympics to date. The silver medals went to Li Ning of China, Koji Gushiken and Shinji Morisue of Japan, and Mitchell Gaylord of the United States. Gaylord's medal was the first for the United States in the vault since 1932. \nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). None of the six finalists from 1980 returned, as all were from boycotting nations. With the absence of the dominant Soviets and strong East Germans, the field was open to the traditional power Japan and rising powers China and the United States. Li Ning and Lou Yun of China had taken second and fourth, respectively, at the 1983 world championships, the highest rankings of the non-boycotting nations.\nThe People's Republic of China and San Marino each made their debut in the men's vault. The United States made its 14th appearance, breaking a tie with the absent Hungary for most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 vault and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. \nThe 1984 Games expanded the number of finalists from six to eight. Nations were still limited to two finalists each. Others were ranked 9th through 71st. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nSeventy-one gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29 and 31st. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 4. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

        "title": "2010–11 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2010 season began on January 8, 2011. The postseason tournament concluded with the Green Bay Packers defeating the Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XLV, 31–25, on February 6, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas. This was the first Super Bowl in which the NFC representative was a #6 seed, and only the second time one has made the Super Bowl (the previous being the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers in Super Bowl XL).\nThis was only the second postseason in NFL history that included a team with a losing record, and the first to occur with a full regular season. The Seattle Seahawks won their division with a 7–9 record, as all four teams in the NFC West had losing seasons in 2010. Only the 1982–83 NFL playoffs, following the strike-shortened 1982 season, had previously included teams with losing records (under a modified 16-team tournament, with eight from each conference, the 1982 Cleveland Browns and Detroit Lions qualified with records of 4–5). Six days after winning the division, the Seahawks defeated the defending Super Bowl champion New Orleans Saints to become the first playoff team with a losing record to win in the postseason, although the Carolina Panthers also won their division and made it to the divisional round with a losing record four years later.\nIn the opening wildcard round of the playoffs, three of the four home teams had fewer wins than the away team. The exception was the Green Bay Packers–Philadelphia Eagles match, where both were 10–6 (the Packers had defeated the Eagles in Week 1 of the season, but were on the road because they were the wild card team). But away teams finished 6–4 this playoff season for wins. This was the second time since the 1979 NFL season where neither of the number one playoff seeds advanced to their conference's respective championship game, the other time being in the 2008–09 NFL playoffs. Also, had the New York Jets also won their conference championship game, it would have been the first Super Bowl between two #6 seeds, let alone two wild card teams.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern Standard Time ()\"\nNew overtime rules.\nThis was the first time that the new postseason overtime rules were in effect, although none of the playoff games this season ended up going into the extra period. Under these new changes, instead of a straight sudden death, the game will not immediately end if the team that wins the coin toss only scores a field goal on its first possession (the game will end if they score a touchdown). Instead, the other team gets a possession. If the coin toss loser then scores a touchdown, it is declared the winner. If the score is tied after both teams had a possession, then it goes back to sudden death.\nSchedule.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the first two Wild Card playoff games, then CBS broadcast the rest of the AFC playoff games. Fox televised the rest of the NFC games and Super Bowl XLV.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 8, 2011.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 41, New Orleans Saints 36.\nThe Seahawks made history by becoming the first 7–9 team ever to make the playoffs and then did it again by becoming the first to win a playoff game, racking up 31 first downs and 474 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown run by Marshawn Lynch late in the fourth quarter. This marked the fifth consecutive year a Super Bowl champion failed to win a playoff game in the next season.\nTwo early Seahawk miscues enabled the Saints to build a 10-point lead. First Olindo Mare kicked the opening kickoff out of bounds, giving New Orleans the ball at their 40-yard line. New Orleans then drove to the Seahawks' 8-yard line, but had to settle for a Garrett Hartley field goal after Reggie Bush dropped a pass on third down that could have kept the drive going. Then three plays into the Seahawks' drive, Matt Hasselbeck's pass went through the hands of receiver Ben Obomanu and into the arms of Jabari Greer, who returned the interception 10 yards to the Seattle 35. New Orleans subsequently drove 35 yards in nine plays, aided by a third down pass interference penalty on Walter Thurmond in the end zone, and scored with Drew Brees' 1-yard touchdown pass to fullback Heath Evans, giving them a 10–0 lead.\nSeattle fullback Michael Robinson returned Hartley's short kickoff 18 yards to the 43-yard line, and the Seahawks struck back with a 57-yard drive that ended with Hasselbeck's 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Carlson. The Saints countered as Brees completed four of five passes for 53 yards on an 83-yard drive that ended with a 5-yard touchdown run by Julius Jones, who had been cut by Seattle early in the season, to again give the Saints a 10-point lead. But Hasselbeck led the Seahawks right back on a 70-yard scoring drive, featuring a 39-yard reception by tight end Cameron Morrah. On the next play, Hasselbeck threw his second touchdown pass to Carlson, cutting the score to 17–14. After an exchange of punts, Jones lost a fumble while being tackled by Raheem Brock that Seattle linebacker David Hawthorne recovered on the Saints' 18-yard line, setting up a 29-yard field goal by Mare to tie the game.\nWith 1:15 left in the second quarter, Hasselbeck launched a 45-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley, giving Seattle their first lead of the game at 24–17. But a 40-yard reception by Devery Henderson helped the Saints drive to the Seattle 3-yard line where Hartley made his second field goal to cut the score to 24–20 as time expired in the half. This was only the second playoff game in which both teams scored at least 20 points in the first two quarters.\nThe Seahawks increased their lead to 31–20 on their opening drive of the second half, as Hasselbeck threw an 18-yard completion to Obomanu and finished the drive with a 38-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams. Then after forcing a punt, Mare kicked a 39-yard field goal to make the score 34–20 with 9:54 left in the quarter. The Seahawks got a chance to build a three-score lead after stopping Jones for no gain on fourth down and 1 on the Saints' 37-yard line, but they could only gain a few yards with their next drive, and a delay of game penalty on fourth down pushed them out of field goal range.\nNew Orleans got the ball back at their 13-yard line following Jon Ryan's punt, and mounted an 83-yard drive that ended with Jones' second touchdown run of the game, making the score 34–27 with 13:11 left in regulation. Then they forced a three-and-out and got the ball back with good field position on their 44-yard line with Lance Moore's 8-yard punt return. On the second play of their ensuing drive, Brees threw a short pass to Jones, who took it 33 yards to the Seattle 23. But several plays later, Seattle's defense halted the drive at the 3-yard line, where the Saints settled for Hartley's third field goal to cut the score to 34–30.\nAfter an exchange of punts, Seattle got the ball with 4:20 left in the game. On the first play of the drive, Lynch was stuffed for no gain. But on the next play, he took off for a 67-yard touchdown run in which he broke seven tackles en route to the end zone. The crowd in Seattle was so loud during the run that local seismographs recorded it as a small earthquake. This play has become colloquially known as the Beast Quake. With 1:52 left, Brees struck back with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Henderson, but the two-point conversion failed, keeping the score at 41–36. Then Carlson sealed the victory by recovering Hartley's onside kick attempt, enabling Seattle to run out the clock.\nBrees completed 39 of 60 passes for 404 yards and two touchdowns. His 39 completions set a postseason record. Jones, who became the first player ever to score a touchdown in the postseason against a team that had cut him in the regular season, rushed for 59 yards and two touchdowns while also catching six passes for 61 yards. Hasselbeck completed 22 of 35 passes for 271 yards and four touchdowns with an interception. Lynch added 131 rushing yards and a touchdown for Seattle, who had not had a 100-yard rusher in any of their regular season games.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Saints and Seahawks.\nAFC: New York Jets 17, Indianapolis Colts 16.\nAs he had done several times before, Colts kicker Adam Vinatieri gave his team a fourth quarter lead with less than a minute remaining by making a clutch field goal. But this time it was not enough, as New York managed to avenge their previous season loss to Indianapolis in the AFC title game by winning on a Nick Folk field goal as time expired in the game.\nThe first quarter was scoreless as every drive by both teams ended with a punt. The game remained scoreless until just over five minutes remained in the half, when Colts quarterback Peyton Manning (playing in what would be his final game in a Colts uniform, as Manning would miss the entire 2011 season because of back surgery) threw a 57-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon. New York responded with a long drive to the Colts' 19-yard line, but with less than a minute left, Justin Tryon intercepted a pass from Mark Sanchez in the end zone to keep them scoreless going into halftime.\nNew York managed to tie the game on their opening drive of the second half, starting with Antonio Cromartie's 41-yard kickoff return to the 37-yard line. The Jets subsequently drove 63 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 20-yard reception by tight end Dustin Keller, on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by LaDainian Tomlinson. Indianapolis countered with a 9-play drive to the New York 29-yard line, with Manning completing a 23-yard pass to Blair White and Joseph Addai rushing for 14 yards. Vinatieri finished the drive with a 47-yard field goal to give them a three-point lead. But the Jets responded with a 17-play, 87-yard drive that consumed almost 10 minutes and featured three third down conversions. Tomlinson capped off the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 14–10.\nWith 5:22 left in the game, Vinatieri's 32-yard field goal cut the Colts' deficit to one point. Indianapolis' defense subsequently forced a punt after three plays, but a running into the punter penalty against them kept the drive going, allowing New York to take more time off the clock and forcing the Colts to use two timeouts. Indianapolis got the ball back with 2:36 left in the game, and retook the lead with a 48-yard drive as Manning completed two passes to tight end Jacob Tamme for gains of 15 and 11 yards, along with a 12-yard completion to White. At the end of the drive, Vinatieri made a 50-yard field goal to give the Colts a two-point lead with 53 seconds left in regulation.\nHowever, the Jets stormed back to drive for the winning score, as Cromartie returned the ensuing kickoff 47 yards to the 46-yard line. After that, Sanchez completed passes to Braylon Edwards and Santonio Holmes for gains of nine and 11 yards. Then after a 2-yard run by Tomlinson, he completed an 18-yard pass to Edwards, who made a leaping catch near the sidelines and managed to keep both feet in bounds at the Colts' 14-yard line with 29 seconds left on the clock. After letting the clock run down to three seconds, New York called their final timeout and sent Folk out to kick a 32-yard field goal, which sailed through the uprights as time expired to win the game for the Jets.\nManning finished 18 of 26 for 221 yards and a touchdown. His top target was Garçon, who caught five passes for 112 yards and a touchdown. Reggie Wayne, the Colts' leading receiver in the regular season, was completely shut down while being covered by Darrelle Revis, held to just one reception for one yard. Tomlinson rushed for 82 yards and two touchdowns while also catching four passes for 17 yards, while running back Shonn Greene added another 70 yards on the ground.\nThis turned out to be the last game Manning would play in a Colts uniform, as he missed the entire 2011 season with a neck injury and signed with the Denver Broncos on March 20, 2012.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Jets and Colts, with New York previously winning two of the three meetings. This was also a rematch of the 2009 AFC Championship Game, which was won by Indianapolis 30–17.\nSunday, January 9, 2011.\nAFC: Baltimore Ravens 30, Kansas City Chiefs 7.\nBaltimore dominated the game on both sides of the ball, massively out-gaining Kansas City in total yards (390 to 161), first downs (26 to 8), and time of possession (44:44 to 18:16). The Chiefs, who only lost 14 turnovers all year, turned the ball over five times and went home with their seventh consecutive playoff loss since the 1993 season. Their losing streak has covered 17 years, four different coaches, and two different owners.\nBaltimore took the opening kickoff and drove 64 yards to a first down at the Chiefs 1-yard line, with Joe Flacco completing a 27-yard pass to Anquan Boldin and three passes to tight end Todd Heap for 32 yards. But they were stuffed twice for no gain and then Flacco's incomplete pass forced them to settle for a field goal from Billy Cundiff. The Ravens quickly forced a punt, but several plays into their next drive Chiefs linebacker Tamba Hali sacked Flacco and forced a fumble, which he recovered on the Baltimore 46. Following a 5-yard scramble by Matt Cassel, Jamaal Charles' 41-yard touchdown romp gave his team a 7–3 lead. It was the longest touchdown run ever allowed by the Ravens in the postseason. Later in the second quarter, the Ravens retook the lead with an 80-yard scoring drive. Ray Rice finished it with a 9-yard touchdown catch to give the Ravens a 10–7 lead with 19 seconds left before halftime.\nIn the second half, Baltimore completely took over the game, adding 20 more unanswered points and holding Charles, who rushed for over 80 yards in the first half, to negative yardage in the last two quarters. Kansas City gained just 25 total yards in the entire half.\nOn the fourth play of the opening second half drive, Cassel threw an interception to safety Haruki Nakamura. Kansas City managed to get the ball back when Charles forced and recovered a fumble from Nakamura during the return, but their second attempt at a drive fared no better and ended with a turnover on downs at the Ravens 38-yard line. Baltimore then drove to the Kansas City 11-yard line where Cundiff made his second field goal of the game. Then Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis forced a fumble while tackling Dexter McCluster that cornerback Chris Carr recovered on the Chiefs 17-yard line, setting up Cundiff's third field goal to increase their lead to 16–7. Just two plays into their next drive, Kansas City lost another turnover when Cassel threw an interception to Dawan Landry, which led to Flacco's 4-yard touchdown pass to Boldin. Then after a three and out, the Ravens put the game away by mounting a 10-minute scoring drive that ended with Willis McGahee's 25-yard touchdown burst with 4:26 left in the game, making the final score 30–7.\nFlacco completed 25 of 34 passes for 265 yards and two touchdowns. He became the first Raven ever to throw multiple touchdown passes in a playoff game. Heap had a career-high 10 receptions for 106 yards, setting the franchise record for receptions in a postseason game. Linebacker Terrell Suggs led the Ravens defense with four tackles and two sacks. Cassel completed just nine of 18 passes for 70 yards with three interceptions, and Dwayne Bowe, the team's top receiver with 1,162 yards and an NFL-leading 15 touchdown catches during the season, did not have any receptions in the game.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Ravens and Chiefs.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 21, Philadelphia Eagles 16.\nTramon Williams' interception in the end zone sealed the Packers victory with 33 seconds left in the game. Green Bay never trailed during the entire game, and got big performances from Aaron Rodgers, who threw for 180 yards and three touchdowns, and James Starks, who rushed for 123 yards, which was more than his entire regular season total.\nPhiladelphia got an early scoring opportunity when they recovered a muffed punt at the Packers 41-yard line. But their drive was halted at the 23 and ended with no points when David Akers missed a 41-yard field goal attempt. Later on, the Packers drove 68 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 27-yard run by Starks. With eight seconds left in the quarter, Rodgers threw a 7-yard touchdown pass to reserve tight end Tom Crabtree, who had not caught a touchdown pass all season. In the second quarter, Williams' 8-yard punt return gave his team the ball at their 43-yard line, and they drove for another touchdown, scoring with Rodgers' 9-yard pass to James Jones. Getting the ball back with just over five minutes left, Philadelphia quarterback Michael Vick completed a 44-yard pass to Jeremy Maclin and rushed for 14 yards to set up a 29-yard field goal by Akers with 1:15 left in the half, putting the Eagles on the board for the first time. Late in the first half, with the Packers seeking to add to their lead, Rodgers threw a deep pass down the sideline to Jones for what would have been a sure touchdown, but the pass was dropped, keeping the score 14–3.\nThe Eagles scored quickly in the second half, taking advantage of Darryl Tapp's fumble recovery while sacking Rodgers on the Packers 24-yard line. One play later, Vick cut the score to 14–10 with a touchdown pass to Jason Avant. But Rodgers led his team back, completing two passes to Donald Driver for 26 yards and a 16-yarder to fullback John Kuhn before finishing the drive with a 16-yard screen pass to Brandon Jackson for a touchdown. Near the end of the quarter, the Eagles mounted a drive to the Packers 16-yard line, but came up empty when Akers missed another field goal, this one from 34 yards.\nWith 8:50 left in the game, Vick completed five of eight passes for 68 yards on a 75-yard touchdown drive, scoring on a fourth down 1-yard run. On a two-point conversion attempt, Vick completed a pass to tight end Brent Celek, but it was negated by a penalty against him for putting a foot out of bounds before he came back to catch the ball and their second attempt was incomplete, keeping the score at 21–16. Philadelphia had to use up all their timeouts on the Packers ensuring drive, but got the ball back with 1:45 left in the game. Receptions by DeSean Jackson and Riley Cooper for gains of 28 and 11 yards moved the ball to the Green Bay 24-yard line. But with 33 seconds left, Williams intercepted a pass intended for Cooper in the end zone to put the game away.\nVick finished with 290 passing yards and a touchdown, with one interception, and added 33 yards and another score on the ground.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Eagles. Philadelphia won both prior meetings, including the 2003 NFC Divisional playoffs, 20–17 in overtime in the game known as \"4th and 26\".\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 15, 2011.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 31, Baltimore Ravens 24.\nSteelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger's 58-yard completion to Antonio Brown set up Rashard Mendenhall's game winning 2-yard touchdown run with 1:33 left in the game. Despite the game's high score, it was actually a defensive battle, with both teams combining for just 389 yards and scoring most of their points off turnovers. Roethlisberger was sacked six times, and Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco was sacked 5. Meanwhile, the Ravens were held to just 126 yards and were buried under a mountain of turnovers, penalties, and dropped passes.\nAfter forcing the Ravens to punt on the opening drive, Pittsburgh drove 80 yards on the way to Mendenhall's 1-yard touchdown run, assisted by a 37-yard pass interference penalty on Baltimore cornerback Josh Wilson. But the Ravens countered with a 68-yard scoring drive, aided by a 33-yard pass interference penalty on Pittsburgh's Anthony Madison. Ray Rice finished the drive with a 14-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Then two plays into the Steelers next drive, Roethlisberger was hit by Terrell Suggs as he pulled his arm back to throw a pass, resulting in a fumble. Nearly all the players on both teams thought it was an incomplete pass since the ball went forward and headed back to their huddles, but Ravens defensive end Cory Redding realized the play was still ongoing and returned the ball 13 yards for a touchdown.\nIn the second quarter, Ravens safety Ed Reed recovered a fumble from Mendenhall at the Steelers 16-yard line, setting up Flacco's 4-yard touchdown pass to Todd Heap that gave them a 21–7 lead. Pittsburgh responded with a drive to the Baltimore 25-yard line, but came up empty when Shaun Suisham missed a 43-yard field goal attempt with 25 seconds left in the half.\nHowever, the Steelers dominated the third quarter, forcing three turnovers and holding the Ravens to negative yardage. Less than five minutes into the quarter, Rice lost a fumble while being tackled by Ryan Clark, and linebacker LaMarr Woodley recovered it on the Baltimore 23-yard line. After a 14-yard run by Mendenhall, Roethlisberger threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to tight end Heath Miller. Then after an exchange of punts, Clark intercepted a pass from Flacco and returned it 17 yards to the Ravens 25-yard line. Mendenhall started the drive with a 13-yard screen, and Roethlisberger finished it with an 8-yard third down touchdown pass to Hines Ward, tying the game at 21. Just two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Flacco fumbled a snap and Steelers defensive end Brett Keisel recovered it at the Baltimore 23. This time the Steelers were unable to get a touchdown, as Roethlisberger was sacked by Suggs on third down and six after driving inside the 10-yard line, but Suisham kicked a 35-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh their first lead with 12:15 left in regulation.\nLater on, Baltimore's Lardarius Webb returned a punt 55 yards for a touchdown, only to have it called back by a holding penalty on Marcus Smith. Still, his return gave them good field position on the Steelers 29-yard line. On the first play of the drive, Flacco completed a 21-yard pass to Heap. But over the next three plays, Baltimore rushers were stuffed twice and then receiver Anquan Boldin dropped a pass in the end zone, forcing them to settle for Billy Cundiff's field goal to tie the score with 3:54 remaining in the game.\nDavid Johnson returned the ensuing kickoff 16 yards to the 35-yard line, and Pittsburgh retook the lead with a 65-yard drive featuring three key third down conversions. After starting out with two incompletions, Roethlisberger threw a 12-yard pass to Ward on third down and ten. Then Roethlisberger was sacked for a 9-yard loss by Redding and Paul Kruger and threw another incompletion, bringing up third down and 19 with 2:07 to go. On the next play, Roethlisberger dropped back and launched a 58-yard bomb to Brown at the 4-yard line. After a defensive holding penalty moved the ball to the 1, the Ravens defense kept Mendenhall out of the end zone for two more plays. But on third down, he scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to give the Steelers a 31–24 lead with 1:33 remaining in regulation.\nLe'Ron McClain returned Suisham's squib kick 12 yards to the Steelers 48-yard line, giving Baltimore a chance to drive for the tying touchdown. But their offense was unable to move the ball. After two incompletions and an 8-yard sack by Ziggy Hood, receiver T. J. Houshmandzadeh dropped a potential first down catch, ending any chance of a comeback.\nRoethlisberger completed 19 of 32 passes for 226 yards and two touchdowns. Steelers linebacker James Harrison recorded five tackles, two assists, and three sacks. Suggs finished with five tackles, three sacks, and a forced fumble. With this win, Pittsburgh advanced to their fourth AFC Championship Game since 2004.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Ravens and Steelers. Pittsburgh won both prior meetings, which includes winning 23–14 in the 2008 AFC Championship Game.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 48, Atlanta Falcons 21.\nThe Packers blew out Atlanta by racking up 442 total yards, 28 first downs, and a franchise playoff record 48 points. Aaron Rodgers was nearly perfect, completing 31 of 36 passes for 366 yards and three touchdowns, while adding another score on the ground. Green Bay never punted the ball, and got a big performance from cornerback Tramon Williams, who picked off two passes from Matt Ryan and returned one of them 70 yards for a touchdown.\nBut early in the game, it seemed things would go in Atlanta's favor. After Michael Koenen's 33-yard punt pinned the Packers back at their own 8-yard line, Rodgers threw a short pass to Greg Jennings, who took off for a 30-yard gain. But he fumbled the ball after being hit from behind by Stephen Nicholas and Brent Grimes recovered the ball at the Green Bay 48-yard line. On the Falcons ensuing drive, a 22-yard reception by Michael Jenkins and a fourth down conversion run by Ovie Mughelli set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Michael Turner. Green Bay responded with an 81-yard scoring drive that took nearly eight minutes. Rodgers completed all seven of his passes for 48 yards on the drive, the last one a 6-yard touchdown toss to Jordy Nelson, who caught the ball near the sidelines and just managed to stretch the ball into the pylon while being shoved out of bounds. However, Atlanta quickly retook the lead when Eric Weems returned Mason Crosby's kickoff 102 yards for a touchdown, the longest scoring play in NFL playoff history.\nBut the Packers suddenly stormed back with 35 unanswered points. Rodgers quickly completed two passes to Jennings for 22 yards and then hit James Jones for a 34-yard gain to the Falcons 16-yard line. Two plays later, fullback John Kuhn scored a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game. Atlanta responded with a drive to the Packers 19-yard line. But on the next play, Charles Woodson sacked Ryan for a 7-yard loss. Then on third down, Williams stepped in front of a pass intended for Jenkins and made a leaping interception in the end zone. Rodgers took over and went back to work, completing six consecutive passes on an 80-yard scoring drive that ended with his 20-yard touchdown completion to Jones, giving the Packers a 21–14 lead with 42 seconds left before halftime. Aided by two pass interference penalties against Green Bay, Atlanta drove to the Packers 26-yard line. But once again the defense prevented a score. First linebacker Clay Matthews sacked Ryan for a 9-yard loss. Rather than attempt a 50-yard field goal, the Falcons tried one last play to move the ball closer. But Williams intercepted Ryan's pass and returned it 70 yards for a touchdown as time expired in the half.\nIn the second half the Packers picked up right where they left off. Rodgers was sacked by John Abraham for a 10-yard loss on the first play. But it didn't stop Rodgers from completing five of six passes for 56 yards on an 80-yard scoring drive that ended with his 7-yard touchdown run, making the score 35–14. Atlanta was forced to a three-and-out on their next drive after a Green Bay replay challenge overruled a first down catch by Jenkins, and Koenen's punt went just 21 yards to midfield. Green Bay subsequently drove 50 yards and scored with Rodgers' 7-yard pass to Kuhn.\nThis time, the Falcons finally managed to respond. Ryan completed seven consecutive passes on their next drive, the last one a 6-yard touchdown throw to Roddy White. But Green Bay dominated the rest of the game, forcing two more turnovers that were both converted into field goals by Crosby, making the final score 48–21.\nJennings finished with eight receptions for 101 yards, while Nelson added eight receptions for 79 yards and a touchdown. This game gave Rodgers 10 touchdown passes in his first three playoff games, setting an NFL postseason record. Matthews had three tackles and two sacks. Weems had six kickoff returns for 195 yards. Turner, who rushed for over 1,300 yards during the season, was held to just 39 yards on 10 carries.\nThe Falcons' loss marked the third time in the last four seasons that the NFC's top seed would not advance past its first playoff game.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Packers and Falcons, with both teams having split the two prior meetings. The most recent before this game ended 27–7 in favor of Atlanta in the 2002 NFC Wild Card playoffs in Green Bay's first ever playoff loss at Lambeau Field.\nSunday, January 16, 2011.\nNFC: Chicago Bears 35, Seattle Seahawks 24.\nChicago dominated the game from start to finish, outgaining Seattle in total yards 437 to 276 and scoring 28 unanswered points over the first three quarters.\nAfter forcing Seattle to a three-and-out on the opening drive, Chicago scored on their third play of the game when tight end Greg Olsen ran past safety Lawyer Milloy, caught a pass from Jay Cutler, and took it 58 yards to the end zone. Later in the quarter, Bears receiver Devin Hester returned a punt 26 yards to midfield. Following a 33-yard reception by Olsen and a fourth down conversion run by Cutler, Chester Taylor scored on a 1-yard touchdown run. After forcing a punt, Chicago got the ball back on their own 37-yard line early in the second quarter. Cutler started the drive with a 22-yard completion to Olsen, and later finished it with a 6-yard touchdown run to give the Bears a 21–0 lead.\nIn the second half, Chicago increased their lead to 28–0 with Cutler's second touchdown run at the end of a 14-play, 70-yard drive. After being completely dominated up to this point, Seattle managed to mount a comeback. First, Leon Washington's 62-yard kickoff return set up a 30-yard field goal by Olindo Mare. Then Seahawks linebacker Aaron Curry intercepted a pass from Bears running back Matt Forte and returned it 23 yards to the Bears 33-yard line. Aided by a defensive holding penalty on Tim Jennings that nullified his interception, Seattle cut the score to 28–10 with Matt Hasselbeck's 2-yard touchdown pass to Mike Williams.\nBut after forcing a punt, Tommie Harris sacked Hasselbeck on third down at his own 13-yard line, and Jon Ryan's punt went just 35 yards to the Seattle 48. Two plays later, Cutler threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Davis, putting Chicago up 35–10.\nWith less than five minutes remaining in the game, Seattle refused to give up. Hasselbeck completed six consecutive passes on the next drive, the last a 17-yard touchdown strike to Williams. After forcing a punt, Hasselbeck completed a 46-yarder to Ben Obomanu and followed it up with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Stokley, bringing the score to 35–24. But Chicago put the game away by recovering Mare's onside kick with 1:25 left in the game.\nCutler finished his first career playoff game completing 15 of 28 passes for 274 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions. He also rushed for 43 yards and two scores. His 43 rushing yards were the most by a Bears quarterback in the postseason since Sid Luckman in 1943. He also joined Otto Graham as one of two players ever to run and throw for multiple touchdowns in a playoff game. Olsen had three receptions for 113 yards, all in the first half. Forte rushed for 80 yards, caught three passes for 54 yards, and threw one pass which was intercepted. Harris had two sacks, which were his only tackles of the game. Hasselbeck threw for 258 yards and three touchdowns. Stokley had eight catches for 85 yards and a score.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Bears. Chicago won the only prior meeting 27–24 in overtime in the 2006 NFC Divisional playoffs.\nThis was Matt Hasselbeck's final game in a Seahawks uniform as he would be traded to Tennessee the next season.\nAFC: New York Jets 28, New England Patriots 21.\nMark Sanchez completed 16 of 25 passes for 194 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Jets to victory, avenging a 45–3 loss to New England in December.\nOn the Patriots’ first drive, Tom Brady threw his first interception since Week 6 of the regular season, which linebacker David Harris picked off and returned 58 yards before tight end Alge Crumpler made a touchdown-saving tackle at the 12-yard line. New York was unable to score off the turnover, as they were unable to get a first down and Nick Folk missed a 30-yard field goal attempt. Several plays into New England's next drive, Brady completed a 28-yard pass to Crumpler at the Jets' 12-yard line. But after a 5-yard run by Danny Woodhead, Crumpler dropped a pass in the end zone and then Brady was sacked by Shaun Ellis, forcing them to settle for Shayne Graham's 34-yard field goal to give them a 3–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, a third down sack of Brady by Drew Coleman forced New England to punt from their own 16, and Jerricho Cotchery returned the ball to the Patriots 49-yard line. A few plays later, Sanchez's 37-yard completion to Braylon Edwards set up his 7-yard touchdown pass to LaDainian Tomlinson. Later on, New England attempted a fake punt with a direct snap to safety Patrick Chung on fourth down and four. But Chung fumbled the snap and was tackled on his own 25-yard line, and the Jets converted the turnover with Sanchez's 15-yard touchdown pass to Edwards with 33 seconds left in the half, making the score 14–3.\nLate in the third quarter, New England drove 80 yards in 11 plays, with Brady completing a 37-yard pass to Rob Gronkowski and two passes to Deion Branch for 28 yards on the way to a 2-yard touchdown pass to Crumpler. Then Sammy Morris scored a two-point conversion run, cutting their deficit to 14–11. But the Jets quickly countered, with Sanchez throwing a short pass to Cotchery, who took it 58 yards to the Patriots 13-yard line. Two plays later, Sanchez threw a high pass for Santonio Holmes, who managed to catch the ball and land in the end zone while falling out of bounds, giving New York a 10-point lead two minutes into the fourth quarter.\nAfter the kickoff, New England drove to the Jets 34-yard line with an eight-minute drive, but then faced fourth down and 13. Rather than risk a 52-yard field goal attempt, they attempted to get the first down, but Branch dropped a pass from Brady and the Patriots turned the ball over. New England's defense then made a key defensive stand, forcing a quick three-and-out, and Julian Edelman returned Steve Weatherford's punt 41 yards to the New York 43-yard line before being tackled by Weatherford himself. Brady then led New England to the 17-yard line where Graham made his second field goal to cut their deficit to seven points. However, Jets corner Antonio Cromartie recovered Graham's onside kick attempt and returned it 23 yards to the Patriots 20-yard line. Shonn Greene then scored with a 16-yard run, making the score 28–14 with 1:41 left in the game.\nBrandon Tate returned the ensuing kickoff 23 yards to the 41-yard line, sparking a 59-yard scoring drive that ended with Brady's 13-yard touchdown pass to Branch with 24 seconds left. But Graham's second attempt at an onside kick also failed, ending any chance of a miracle comeback.\nBrady finished the game 29 of 45 for 299 yards and two touchdowns, with one interception. His one pick ended his NFL record of consecutive passes without an interception at 340. Cotchery had five receptions for 96 yards, Harris had nine tackles, three assists, and an interception, while Ellis added five tackles and two sacks. With this win, the Jets advanced to their second consecutive AFC Championship Game in Sanchez's first two years as a starter.\nThis would be the last time the Patriots would get eliminated prior to the AFC Championship Game until 2019. Until 2020, this was the last playoff win by an AFC East team other than New England. In the 2021-22 NFL playoffs AFC Wild Card round, the AFC East Division Champion Buffalo Bills defeated the Patriots 47-17 in Highmark Stadium.\nThis was the third postseason meeting between the Jets and Patriots. New England won both prior meetings, including a 37–16 victory in the 2006 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 23, 2011.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 21, Chicago Bears 14.\nGreen Bay's defense knocked Chicago starting quarterback Jay Cutler out of the game and intercepted three passes, one of which was returned for a score, and another which ended a last minute drive for a potential tying touchdown. With this win, the Packers became the first NFC #6 seed to advance to the Super Bowl by defeating the top three seeded teams on the road.\nPackers quarterback Aaron Rodgers opened up the game with two completions to Greg Jennings for gains of 26 and 22 yards. A few plays later, he threw a 22-yard completion to Jordy Nelson at the Bears 2-yard line, setting up his 1-yard touchdown run to give the Packers an early 7–0 lead. Later on, Tim Masthay's 32-yard punt pinned Chicago back on their own 2-yard line. The Bears were unable to move the ball, and Tramon Williams returned Brad Maynard's punt six yards to the 44. Rodgers then completed passes to Brandon Jackson and Nelson for gains of 16 and 15 yards on the way to a 4-yard touchdown run by James Starks.\nWith time running out in the half, Rodgers threw a pass that was intercepted by Lance Briggs and returned to the Chicago 43. But Cutler returned the favor with an interception thrown to Sam Shields and the score remained 14–0 going into halftime. Cutler was injured on the play and although he returned for a few plays in the third quarter, he ended up having to sit the rest of the second half out.\nAfter forcing Chicago to punt on the opening second half drive, Green Bay drove to the Bears 6-yard line. But linebacker Brian Urlacher ended the drive by intercepting Rodgers and returning the ball 39 yards before Rodgers made a touchdown saving tackle on the 45. However, Chicago could not take advantage of the turnover and had to punt. Cutler's replacement, Todd Collins, ended up being ineffective, throwing four consecutive incompletions before being benched in favor of Caleb Hanie with less than a minute left in the third quarter.\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Hanie's 32-yard completion to Johnny Knox moved the ball to the Packers 1-yard line, setting up a touchdown run by Chester Taylor that cut the score to 14–7. But three drives later, Hanie threw a short pass over the middle that was intercepted by nose tackle B. J. Raji and returned 18 yards for a touchdown. Hanie responded with four consecutive completions on the Bears next drive and finished it with a 35-yard touchdown throw to Earl Bennett, making the score 21–14. Then after forcing a punt, Chicago got the ball back with 2:53 remaining in the game and managed to drive to the Packers 29-yard line. But Green Bay's defense managed to hang on for the win, ending the drive with Shields' second interception with 37 seconds left in regulation.\nJennings caught eight passes for 130 yards. Bears running back Matt Forte rushed for 70 yards and caught 10 passes for 90. Shields had four tackles, two interceptions, a sack, and a forced fumble. Urlacher had nine tackles, a sack, and an interception. At 338 pounds, Raji became the heaviest player in NFL history to score a touchdown.\nIn possibly the NFL's first player-on-player social media attack, Cutler was being criticized for not returning within seconds after leaving the game instead of waiting for explanations in postgame media sessions. Bears coach Lovie Smith later stated that the choice was not Cutler's decision. Smith made the decision to bench Cutler after consulting the medical and training staff. An MRI revealed the following day that he had sprained his MCL.\nThe Bears would not return to the playoffs again until 2018.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Packers and Bears, with Chicago having won the prior meeting 33–14 in the 1941 Western Division playoff.\nAFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 24, New York Jets 19.\nPittsburgh jumped to an early 24–0 lead and held off a desperate comeback rally to earn their third Super Bowl bid in the last six years.\nSteelers running back Rashard Mendenhall rushed eight times for 28 yards on their opening drive, which took over nine minutes off the clock and ended with his 1-yard touchdown run. Then he rushed four times for 22 yards and caught an 18-yard pass on a drive to the Jets 32-yard line. Linebacker Bryan Thomas ended the drive with an interception, but the Steelers forced a punt and drove for another score, aided by Mendenhall's 35-yard burst. Shaun Suisham finished the drive with a 20-yard field goal to make the score 10–0. Following another punt, Ben Roethlisberger completed a 24-yard pass to tight end Heath Miller, a 20-yarder to Emmanuel Sanders, and a 14-yard throw to Mendenhall on the way to a 2-yard touchdown run. Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Ike Taylor sacked Jets quarterback Mark Sanchez on a defensive back blitz and forced a fumble, which cornerback William Gay returned 19 yards for a touchdown, increasing their lead to 24–0 with just over a minute left in the half. This time New York managed to respond, with Sanchez completing four passes for 39 yards on a drive that ended with a 42-yard field goal by Nick Folk, cutting the score to 24–3 going into halftime.\nNew York took the second half kickoff and scored with just five plays. Shonn Greene started off the drive with a 23-yard run, while Sanchez finished it with a pair of completions to Santonio Holmes, the first for 16 yards, and the second a 45-yard touchdown completion. Pittsburgh responded with a drive to the Jets 37-yard line, but turned the ball over when safety Brodney Pool intercepted a pass from Roethlisberger inside the 10. After an exchange of punts, the Jets converted two fourth downs on a 17-play drive to a first down on the Steelers 2-yard line. But Pittsburgh's defense made a key goal line stand. First Greene tried to run up the middle, but was stuffed at the 1-yard line. Then Sanchez threw an incomplete pass and another that was batted down by linebacker LaMarr Woodley. On fourth down, LaDainian Tomlinson tried to run through the middle, but Brett Keisel and Casey Hampton tackled him for no gain, turning the ball over.\nOn the next play, Roethlisberger fumbled a snap and was downed in the end zone for a safety. New York then drove 58 yards following the free kick and scored with Sanchez's 4-yard touchdown pass to Jerricho Cotchery, cutting their deficit to 24–19 with 3:06 left in the game. But the Steelers managed to pick up two key first downs on their next drive with a 14-yard reception by Miller and a 14-yard catch by Antonio Brown on third down and six with less than two minutes left, enabling them to run out the rest of the clock.\nMendenhall rushed for 121 yards and a touchdown, while also catching two passes for 32. Sanchez threw for 233 yards and two touchdowns. Pool had six tackles and an interception.\nAs of 2024, this is the Jets' most recent playoff appearance, and the latest AFC Championship Game to not feature either the New England Patriots or the Kansas City Chiefs.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Jets and Steelers, with Pittsburgh winning the only prior meeting 20–17 in overtime in the 2004 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nSuper Bowl XLV: Green Bay Packers 31, Pittsburgh Steelers 25.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Steelers and Packers."

        "text": "Portsmouth Northsea Swimming Club (PNSC) in Portsmouth, England, is the largest swimming club in South Hampshire. In recent years, the club has been well known for producing Olympic swimmers including Katy Sexton, MBE, and Gemma Spofforth, as well as Paralympic swimmer and triathlete, Lauren Steadman, OBE. Before pool closures during the COVID-19 pandemic, the club had 250 members between the ages 7 and 74, and offered 80 training sessions a week led by 10 swimming coaches, plus a strength and conditioning coach. Portsmouth Northsea SC uses four pools across the city, with Mountbatten Leisure Centre as its main base, and offers a Learn to Swim Programme, annual Club Championships, Open Meet competitions, and an Easter Swim Festival. PNSC competes in the Arena League, and has won the trophy for the southern region three times.\nHistory.\nThe club states that it was founded in 1927 and named after the Northsea Arms, a pub that has since closed, in Stamshaw. A 1933 article in the \"Portsmouth Evening News,\" however, traces the club's inception as far back as the summer of 1911, when the Stamshaw Swimming Pond first opened. In 1919, Superintendent George Byng called a meeting of his supporters to form a swimming club and resume aquatic activities, which had been on hiatus during World War I. Not wanting to call the club \"Stamshaw\", the committee eventually settled on the name Northsea Swimming Club rather than \"Southsea\", because of its location in the northern part of town. The Northsea Swimming Club subsequently formed a water polo team, which won a local competition in 1926. In 1927, Edwin A. Palmer became chairman of the club, with C. H. Webb as Honorary Secretary. In the first year under Palmer's leadership, club membership was expanded from 14 to 150, and by 1933, it had 516 members. At that time, the Northsea Swimming Club had one of the strongest junior sections in the county, and was known for its annual open water swimming race to the Isle of Wight.\nNotable past coaches at Portsmouth Northsea SC have included international coach Chris Nesbit, who served as Head Coach for PNSC from 1980 to 2005. In 2009, PNSC moved from its home at the Victoria Swimming Baths to the new Mountbatten Leisure Centre, with a modern, 8-lane 50-metre Olympic swimming pool.\nNotable members.\nOver the years, Portsmouth Northsea SC has trained many British swimmers that have reached international competitions such as the Olympic and Paralympic Games, including:"

        "title": "2010 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2010 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2010 NRL season. Played on Sunday, 3 October at Sydney's ANZ Stadium, the match was contested by the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Sydney Roosters. It was the first time the two sides met in a grand final. They had played each other twice before during the season, with St. George Illawarra winning on both occasions. St. George Illawarra finished the season as minor premiers as they had the previous season. The Roosters were the previous year's wooden-spooners and only after playing and winning for five consecutive weeks were able to reach the 2010 decider.\nIn the grand final, St. George Illawarra trailed by two points at halftime, but broke the shackles in the second half, keeping the Roosters scoreless while adding 26 points to their score. The game finished with a 24-point margin in favour of St. George Illawarra, claiming their first premiership as a joint-venture club.\nBackground.\nThe 2010 NRL season was the 103rd season of professional rugby league football club competition in Australia, and the thirteenth run by the National Rugby League. The season commenced on 12 March with sixteen teams competing for the 2010 Telstra Premiership whilst the third season of the National Youth Competition was also in progress.\nThe 2010 season was marred by the Melbourne Storm's admission in April of systematically breaching the salary cap. As part of the NRL's imposed penalties, the Storm were deducted all 8 competition points earned at the time of the announcement, and were barred from receiving points for the rest of the season, guaranteeing them the wooden spoon.\nSt. George Illawarra Dragons.\nSt. George Illawarra qualified for the Grand Final having defeated the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and the Wests Tigers in the finals series. The club had finished the regular season as minor premiers for the second consecutive season. St. George Illawarra suffered a poor record in finals matches, having been knocked out of the finals series in straight sets in 2009, and having qualified for a Grand Final only once (in 1999, their first year as a joint venture) in eight finals appearances since the joint venture came into existence. It had been 31 years since the St. George Dragons side of the joint venture last won a premiership, while the Illawarra Steelers club had never won a premiership or qualified for a Grand Final.\nSydney Roosters.\nThe Sydney Roosters entered the Grand Final from a markedly different path to that of the Dragons. The Roosters had finished the 2009 season on the bottom of the ladder. Under new coach Brian Smith, and having signed troubled star Todd Carney, the Roosters improved to finish sixth on the ladder in 2010, before consecutive finals series victories against the Wests Tigers, the Penrith Panthers and the Gold Coast Titans launched the club into the Grand Final. The Sydney Roosters were thus in a position where they could become the first club since the Western Suburbs Magpies in 1934 to win a premiership after finishing last in the previous season.\nGrand final day schedule.\nAustralian rock band You Am I headlined the pre-match entertainment, which also featured Jessica Mauboy, Australian dance act Justice Crew, an ensemble of the Sydney Children's Choir, the Gondwana National Indigenous Children's Choir and the Glebe Public School Choir and a tribute to the NRL's retiring players. The 21 Australian soldiers killed in the war in Afghanistan also received a tribute that concluded with the traditional arrival of a Blackhawk helicopter.\nMatch details.\nThe Grand Final commenced at approximately 5.15pm, following the grand finals of the NSW Cup between Windsor Wolves and Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and the Toyota Cup between South Sydney Rabbitohs and New Zealand Warriors. The weather was overcast, 13 degrees Celsius, with light rain which meant the two earlier matches had caused the centre of the field to become muddy. A crowd of 82,334 was in attendance for the match.\nFirst half.\nAfter a sixth-minute penalty to St. George Illawarra helped them up into good field position, Jamie Soward from the ten-metre line kicked the ball over into the Roosters' in-goal and Mark Gasnier, racing through from the right side, leapt to catch it on the full and put it down just inside the dead ball line. The video referee Bill Harrigan awarded the try and Soward's conversion was successful, so St. George Illawarra was leading 6-0 after eight minutes. However, video replays showed that in the lead up to the try, St. George Illawarra winger Brett Morris had passed the ball with a foot outside the touch-line so play should not have been allowed to continue. Later, in the sixteenth minute, the Sydney Roosters had made their way up into better field position when Todd Carney, twenty metres from the opposition try-line's right side, kicked high to the left corner. His winger Joseph Leilua caught the ball, crashed over the try-line, and while attempting to put it down had it knocked from his outstretched hand by Jamie Soward's knee, but Roosters captain Braith Anasta was there to ground it. The video referee was again called upon to award the try, and with Carney's kick going wide the score was 6-4 in favour of the Red &amp; Whites. Less than two minutes after the restart of play St. George Illawarra knocked on in their own half and the Tricolours, after getting within fifteen metres of the try-line, moved the ball through the hands from the left side of the field to the right where Mitchell Aubusson crashed over near the corner. Carney again missed the conversion but his side was now in the lead 8-6 with a quarter of the match gone. In the twenty-sixth minute St. George Illawarra were awarded a penalty in a goal-kicking position but Soward missed. At the thirty-minute mark St. George Illawarra prop Michael Weyman was helped off the field after getting a swinging arm to the head from Daniel Conn which was placed on report. The third quarter of the match was played in both ends of the ground with neither side able to turn their opportunities into points, so the teams left the field with the Sydney Roosters leading 8-6.\nSecond half.\nLess than six minutes after the break and having forced the Sydney Roosters to do a goal-line drop-out, St. George Illawarra got their first try of the half. On the second tackle and twenty metres out, the ball made its way through their hands to right winger Jason Nightingale who stepped around his defender and dove over in the corner. Soward's kick from the sideline added the extra two points, so St. George Illawarra led 12 - 8. The rain had started falling heavily when the Red &amp; Whites scored another similar try, with a long cut-out pass going to ground but Nightingale was able to pick it up and cross in his corner again. Soward again kicked the extras, pushing his side's lead out to 18 - 8 with a quarter of the match remaining. About two minutes later St. George Illawarra had again worked the ball up into an attacking position when Nathan Fien, less than ten metres from the uprights, darted ahead from dummy half before passing to Dean Young who juggled the ball as he crashed through the defence and over the line. The video referee awarded the try 'benefit of the doubt' and with Soward adding the extras the Dragons were now leading 24 - 8. The Roosters, still unable to get the ball out of their danger zone conceded another penalty in front of their posts and Soward added another two points for his team, making it 26 - 8. Further errors from the Tricolours led to another White &amp; Red attacking wave and another close-range try, with Fien pushing through the goal-line defence from dummy half. After another simple kick for Soward, St. George Illawarra lead 32 - 8, and with no more points in the remaining eight minutes this was the full-time score to secure St. George Illawarra their first premiership as a joint-venture side. The premiership also ended 31 years of hurt for St. George fans as the club had previously lost finals in 1985, 1992, 1993, 1996 and 1999.\nTimeline.\n-8th: Dragons 6–0 (Try: Gasnier, Goal: Soward)\n-16th: Roosters 6-4 (Try: Anasta)\n-20th: Roosters 8-6 (Try: Aubusson)\n-46th: Dragons 12-8 (Try: Nightingale, Goal: Soward)\n-60th: Dragons 18-8 (Try: Nightingale, Goal: Soward)\n-63rd: Dragons 24-8 (Try: Young, Goal: Soward)\n-67th: Dragons 26-8 (Penalty Goal: Soward)\n-70th: Dragons 32-8 (Try: Fien, Goal: Soward)\nIt was the third time in the 2010 season that St. George Illawarra had trailed the Sydney Roosters at halftime before keeping them scoreless in the second half to win. St. George Illawarra fullback Darius Boyd was judged by Australian selectors to be awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match. Boyd became the fourth fullback to win the Clive Churchill, after Newcastle's Robbie O'Davis (1997), former Brisbane teammate Darren Lockyer (2000) and Melbourne's Billy Slater (2009). Boyd had a hand in both of Nightingale's tries and made 111 metres from 13 hit-ups. This was Boyd's second premiership win, having won with the Brisbane Broncos in his debut season in 2006.\nAudience.\nAustralia's national television audience for the match was over 3.1 million and up on the previous year's decider in Sydney and Brisbane. A further 197,000 people watched the game live in New Zealand.\n2011 World Club Challenge.\nHaving won the NRL grand final, St. George Illawarra had earned the right to play against 2010's Super League XV Champions, the Wigan Warriors in the following February's World Club Challenge, which they won 21-15."

In 1932, at the age of 54, he appeared in one game for the Portland Beavers, the team he was managing at the time, hitting a single. A first baseman for the majority of his career, although he pitched in a few games as well, Abbott hit below .250 with regularity, nearing the Mendoza Line on occasion.

Only three other Davis Cup ties played in Canada have ever been on grass, one held at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club in 1952, one at the Victoria Lawn Tennis Club on Vancouver Island in 1956, and one held at the Hollyburn Country Club in Vancouver in 1992.\nAs of 2009, the club has been operating for 102 years."

        "title": "Frank Stout (rugby union)",
        "text": "Frank Moxon Stout MC (21 February 1877 – 30 May 1926) also referred to as Frank Moxham Stout, was an English international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Gloucester and Richmond. Stout played international rugby for England and was selected for the British Isles on two tours in 1899 and 1903. On the 1899 tour of Australia, he acted as on field captain for three of the Tests.\nStout came from a notable sporting family, his father William Stout, was a Diamond Sculls winner, while his brother, Percy also played international rugby for England.\nRugby career.\nStout first came to note as a rugby player when he joined Gloucester and became the club's first player to represent an international team while on the book. His first cap for England was the opening game of the 1897 Home Nations Championship, played away against Wales. England lost the game 11–0, but the selectors kept faith in Stout and he was back in the team for the second English encounter of the tournament, another away game, this time to Ireland. After a second loss, Stout was replaced for the next game by Herbert Dudgeon.\nDuring the 1897 season, Stout was approached to play for the invitational touring team, Barbarian F.C., of which he would eventually become a committee member.\nDespite not playing in a winning team in his first Home Nations campaign, Stout played in all three matches of the 1898 Championship. The opening game to Ireland was another loss, but in the encounter with Scotland, Stout was joined by his brother Percy for the first time at the international level. Percy also represented Gloucester, but at three-quarters position. The game ended in a three all draw, and the brothers were chosen again in the final encounter, against Wales at the Rectory Field in Blackheath. Not only did England win the match, but both Stout and Percy scored a try each, the first time brothers had both scored a try for England at the international level. The next time this feat was achieved was in the 1993 Five Nations Championship by Rory and Tony Underwood.\nStout played in only the final two matches of the 1899 Home Nations Championship, a season for England in which they lost all three encounters. Percy played in all three losses, and the brothers played their last match as England players together in the encounter with Scotland on 11 March 1899.\nIn 1899, Stout was approached to join the British Isles team on the first official tour of Australia. Stout played in all 21 matches of the tour, scoring four tries in total. After the tourists lost the First Test to Australia, the British captain, Matthew Mullineux, removed himself from further Test matches and gave Stout the on-field captaincy. The British team went on to win the final three Tests, taking the series 3–1.\nOn his return to England, Stout was not part of the England team, despite playing for the Barbarians on their Christmas tour of Wales of 1899. The next time Stout represented England he had left Gloucester and was now playing for Richmond. Stout was selected to play in the final game of the 1903 Home Nations Championship, losing the Calcutta Cup to Scotland at Richmond. Before the next season began, Stout was offered a place on his second British Isles' tour, this time to South Africa. Stout played in all three Tests against South Africa, which resulted in two draws and a loss.\nBack in Britain, Stout was not only selected for the 1904 Home Nations Championship, but was given the captaincy. England drew the opener against Wales, in which Stout converted one of the England tries; and although Stout played in the remaining two games of the tournament, John Daniell was handed the captaincy. Stout's final campaign for England was the 1905 Championship, in which Stout captained his country to three defeats.\nAs well as having a distinguished Rugby career, Stout played for the newly formed Gloucester City football team, along with his two brothers. He appeared 34 times, scoring one goal between 1893 and 1895.\nMilitary service.\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Stout joined the British Army and was posted to the 20th Hussars. In September 1914, he and his brother Percy were both promoted to acting Second Lieutenant. During the war, Stout was awarded the Military Cross, for his actions while serving in the British lines. On hearing that the enemy had been seen working close to the British positions, he took Corporal G. Tester and a light machine gun to the saphead, at the end of the trench. They mounted the machine gun on top of the trench, and then Corporal Tester, standing on Stout's shoulders, opened fire on the enemy who was only 30 to 40 yards away. Under heavy enemy fire, Tester fired 150 rounds, before he and Stout switched positions to allow Stout to continue the attack. The next day fourteen enemy dead were counted. For this action, Stout was awarded the MC while Tester received the DCM. The events were recorded and published, along with a black-and-white print, in a volume recounting acts of heroism from the First World War.\nStout was promoted to full Lieutenant in August 1918."

I was not in the leading pack, but I remembered that my coach told me to give it my best effort and to speed it up in the last 1500 meters.

I wasn't confident about getting a medal, the group stayed together so long and it was difficult to get out.

The team is organised by Basketball Ireland, and play their home games at the National Basketball Arena in Tallaght. As of 2024, the team was ranked 80th in the FIBA Women's World Ranking.\nHistory.\nA team representing Ireland participated in the 1980 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament for Women, but did not qualify. As of 1989, the Ireland women's team was contesting the European Promotion Cup for Women, and placed second in the competition.\nIn February 2010, during the Irish financial crisis, Basketball Ireland announced that it was €1.2m in debt and would deactivate its senior international squads to cut costs. A team representing Ireland was reformed in 2013, when a \"Premier League All Stars\" team played Wales in a match to mark The Gathering Ireland 2013 festival. Ireland also competed in 3x3 basketball at the 2014 Europe Championships and the 2015 European Games.\nIn late 2015, it was announced that the national team would again join official FIBA Europe competitions after accepting an invitation to play the 2016 FIBA Women's European Championship for Small Countries. The Irish team came second in the 2016 event, after losing to Malta in the final. An Irish team also entered the 2018 event (which took place in Cork) and placed sixth. \nBefore a FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2025 qualifier, held in February 2024, in response to \"inflammatory and wholly inaccurate accusations of anti-Semitism [..] published on official Israeli [Basketball] federation channels\", members of the team \"boycotted the usual pre-match pleasantries\" and did not shake hands with the Israeli team. A number of Irish team members also opted not to travel to the game, which had been postponed from November 2023 and moved to Riga in Latvia due to the Israel–Hamas war. Ireland lost the game by 30 points.\nSquad.\nAs of 2024 (EuroBasket Women 2025 qualifiers), the squad included:"

The powerful Yevgeny Bezruchenko (RUS) crossed the finish line just ahead of teammate Vladimir Dyatchin (RUS). Peggy Büchse (GER) who was second in Monday's 5 km race, easily outpaced Irina Abysova (RUS) for the women's 10 km event. Bezruchenko and Abysova are both coached by three time world champion Aleksey Akatyev.\nTwenty-seven minutes after fireworks signaled the start of the men's 10 km race, a close-knit pack of five lead swimmers were navigating around buoy number three, the farthest distance from the start line, and beginning their return of the first lap of the course. Their course was straight for the Fukuoka Dome and directly into the bright sunlight that glowed off Hakata Bay. There were 29 athletes and almost as many boats. The brisk wind added a wavy chop and another challenge to these swimmers.\nThe two Australians, a Syrian, a Frenchman and a New Zealander were an unlikely collection of athletes to be leading the race, but it was early with little more than one quarter of the race under their belt. Stéphane Lecat (FRA) and Mark Saliba (AUS) took turns leading the race for the next hour matching each other stroke for stroke and sizing each other up at each breath they took. But the Russians and Italians had been in the middle of the pack throughout, always within striking distance, conserving their energy and planning a strong finish when the time was right.\n\"My strategy was to say with the crowd the whole time, and move in front at the final point, then lead the race with the best of my ability,\" said a proud Bezruchenko who had garnered a silver medal in the 5 km race event on Monday.\nAt the 7500-meter mark, Fabio Venturini (ITA) broke from the pack, trailed by Bezruchenko, Dyatchin and Samuele Pampana (ITA). Several loud whistle blasts from the referee indicated that the swimmers were being scolded for drafting off each other. Additionally Pampana had been warned by the referee to avoid bodily contact with other swimmers and was threatened with disqualification for intentional interference of another swimmer. With less than 300 meters to go, the referee confirmed what Dyatchin already knew, that Pampana had been punching or slapping the smaller Russian with each stroke he took. The referee made the decision to disqualify Pampana but the two Russians and the two Italians were unaware of his decision. All four athletes sprinted to the finish line and each pounded the banner marking the end of the race until the banner fell into the water unable to take further punishment until it was rehung by officials.\nVenturini told the media \"this is a bittersweet medal, it obviously belonged to Pampana.\" Italian team officials filed a protest with the referee but the decision was upheld. The Italians then took their protest to the jury of appeals, the FINA Bureau, which upheld the earlier decision. This decision may impact on the team trophy as only one Italian will score points.\nThe 10-km event has been proposed for inclusion in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece. The final events of the FINA Open Water Swimming competition will be held on Saturday when the men's 25 km competition starts at 8am and the women's 25 km begins at 9am.\nResults.\nKey: DNF = Did not finish, DQ = Disqualified"

They both looked more confident from the very first buoy. Valli was 2 minutes behind at 8 km. Van Dijk was in the lead for half the distance, but after rounding the buoy at 12.5 km, Valli took the lead and the Dutch swimmer was unable to keep up with her.\n\"I won!

        "text": "The 2010 US Open was a tennis tournament played on outdoor hard courts, held from August 30 to September 13, 2010, in the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York City, United States.\nThe tournament was initially going to finish with Men's Singles final on September 12, but was postponed due to rain on the last day and just before the men's tournament final. In the previous two years the tournament was also postponed because of weather.\nJuan Martín del Potro and Kim Clijsters were the defending champions. Del Potro, due to a wrist injury, opted not to defend his title. Clijsters successfully defended her title with a score of 6–2, 6–1 in the final against Vera Zvonareva.\nNotable stories.\nSerena Williams' withdrawal.\nThree-time champion and World No. 1 Serena Williams officially announced her withdrawal from the US Open on August 20 due to foot surgery. Her withdrawal also meant that she and older sister Venus could not pair up to defend the doubles title they won in 2009, and allowed WTA No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki to be installed as the top seed for the tournament, where she was defeated in the semi-finals by Vera Zvonareva. It was the first time since 2003 in which Serena Williams was forced to miss her national championships due to injury, the first Grand Slam tournament she missed through injury since Wimbledon in 2006, the first time since the 2007 Australian Open in which the women's World No. 1 missed a Grand Slam tournament and the first time in the WTA's 35-year rankings history that the World No. 1 missed the US Open.\nOther notable withdrawals included two-time champion Justine Henin, as well as men's defending champion Juan Martín del Potro, Tommy Haas, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Ivo Karlović and Mario Ančić. Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Ana Ivanovic, Kim Clijsters and John Isner had all been in doubt after suffering minor injuries during lead-up tournaments but all were cleared to play.\nVictoria Azarenka collapses.\nIn a second round match played in heat, Belarusian 10th seed Victoria Azarenka collapsed whilst trailing Gisela Dulko 1–5 in the first set. Azarenka was subsequently taken to hospital in a wheelchair where she was diagnosed with mild concussion and later released a statement saying that a mishap in the gym, and not the heat, caused her to collapse during the match. Her second round retirement represented her worst ever performance at the US Open, having never previously fallen before the third round. It was also the second time she was forced to retire from a match at a Major, when she retired in near identical circumstances against Serena Williams at the 2009 Australian Open.\nSpanish performance.\nThe men's tournament was well known for the excellent performances of Spanish players. Of the sixteen Spaniards that started in the 128-man draw, six of them reached the fourth round: Rafael Nadal, Fernando Verdasco, Tommy Robredo, David Ferrer, Feliciano López and Albert Montañés. There were two all-Spanish fourth round matches, guaranteeing two Spaniards in the quarter-finals: Nadal vs. López and Ferrer vs. Verdasco (the latter winning in a final set tiebreak). In a rematch of their 2009 Australian Open semi-final, Nadal defeated Verdasco in straight sets in the all-Spanish quarter-final, and went on to become the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win the US Open.\nSingles players.\nMen's singles\nEvents.\nMen's singles.\n Rafael Nadal def.

Players were divided into four teams of four players each that were named after members of the US Open Court of Champions. All teams played two matches from Wednesday, September 8, through Saturday, September 11.

A native of Tompkinsville, Kentucky, he attended Western Kentucky University. Poland threw right-handed, batted left-handed, and stood tall, weighing .\nPoland's baseball career began in the St. Louis Cardinals' far-flung farm system of the 1930s. He eventually reached the highest minor-league level (then Double-A), but his Major League Baseball debut did not occur until , when at age 33 Poland appeared in a New York Giants uniform on April 22. He was traded five days and four games later to the Boston Braves, with infielder Connie Ryan, in exchange for future Baseball Hall of Fame catcher Ernie Lombardi. But, unlike Lombardi, Poland was exclusively a reserve catcher during his MLB career. He appeared in all or parts of five seasons (1943–44; 1946–48), for the Giants, Braves, Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds, batting a meek .185 with no home runs and 19 runs batted in in 83 games played.\nPoland's minor league managerial career preceded his MLB service when, at age 30, he skipped the Cardinals' Cambridge Canners affiliate in the Class D Eastern Shore League in 1940. In 1949, he rejoined the Giants and managed in their farm system through 1954, including service with the Triple-A Ottawa Giants and the Double-A Nashville Vols. He then scouted for the Giants' franchise until his death, at age 74, in Guthrie, Kentucky."

Marking her every move throughout the race was the Soviet pair of 1500 metres world record holder Tatyana Kazankina and 3000 metres world record holder Svetlana Ulmasova who expected to use their superior finishing speed. As Decker gradually increased the pace, the field stretched out to a lead pack of five, with Wendy Smith-Sly and Agnese Possamai. As the final lap approached, Sly, who ran in the USA frequently, moved to join Decker on her shoulder, while Brigitte Kraus covered the gap to join the lead pack. The Decker/Sly wall kept the Soviet runners boxed in for half a lap, but when Kraus moved on the rail, Kazankina popped free and the race was on to the finish. Coming off the final turn Kazankina looked ready to pass Decker, but she never got there as Decker found an extra gear to hold her off. Kazankina eventually slowed before the finish to be passed by a fast closing Kraus two steps before the line.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;"

He was immediately called by the match referee after the match was over. There Afridi pleaded guilty to ball tampering and he was banned from two Twenty20 Internationals.\nDuring the Twenty20 International, Australian fast bowler Shaun Tait bowled the fastest delivery ever recorded in Australia (160.7 km/h). Tait achieved the feat on the second ball of his first over. It is also the third fastest delivery ever recorded behind Brett Lee and Shoaib Akhtar.\nAustralia registered a clean sweep by winning the Test series 3–0, the ODI series 5–0 and the only T20.\nDuring the tour, speculation was rife that captain Mohammad Yousuf was involved in a power struggle with former skippers Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik and that team morale was low.\nFollowing the tour, the Pakistan Cricket Board conducted an inquiry and announced that Yousuf and Younis would not be selected for the country in future, implying a life exclusion, and banned Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan for a year each. Afridi and the brothers Umar and Kamran Akmal were all fined and put on probation for six months. Kamran had been dropped after the second Test because of a string of dropped catches, but spoke out against the decision and insisted that he was not dropped, while Umar was accused of disruption by feigning injury in an attempt to go on strike in solidarity.\nTest series.\n2nd Test.\nAt an inquiry after the series was completed, the management of the Pakistan team testified that they suspected that some of the Pakistan team conspired with bookmakers in match-fixing events during this match. Pakistani wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal missed four catches and a run-out in the Australian second innings as Australia turned around a substantial first innings deficit to win the Test. However, the Australian captain Ricky Ponting stated that he \"certainly had no suspicions\". Several months later, Mazhar Majeed a man who had accepted a bribe to provide information about spot-fixing during Pakistan's summer tour of England, stated that the match had been fixed and that the fixers had made more than a million pounds as a result of Pakistan's loss from a commanding position. There has been no other corroboration of Majeed's statements."

        "title": "East Africa rugby union team",
        "text": "Established in 1950, the East Africa rugby union team is a multi-national rugby union team drawing players from Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, though the vast majority of these came from Kenya which has traditionally been the strongest rugby playing nation in the region. The team has played against incoming international, representative and club touring sides and it conducted seven tours between 1954 and 1982.\nThough East Africa do play under the \"Tuskers\" nickname, it is used exclusively when they are on tour; for all matches played at home they are referred to as \"East Africa\". This tradition has come into being because the team had existed for five years by the time of the first external tour in 1954 when the touring side adopted the Tuskers moniker, as have all subsequent tours.\nFor 30 years the team lay dormant, though the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) continued to exist as the governing body of rugby within the three countries, until (on 9 July 2011 at an event at the RFUEA Ground) the team was re-launched by Mwangi Muthee (Chairman of the Kenya Rugby Football Union), William Blick (President of the Uganda Rugby Union), George Kariuki (Rugby Football Union of East Africa) and John Lloyd (Rugby Patrons Society). The team played its first fixture in almost exactly 30 years against England Counties XV at the RFUEA grounds in early June 2012.\nEarly history.\nThe first union in British East Africa was the Rugby Football Union of Kenya (RFU-K), founded in August 1921; it was responsible for the administration of the game throughout Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika which it carried out through various district sub-unions throughout the region. Several universities and Royal Navy ships sent teams to tour East Africa during this period. The Combined South African Universities toured in 1929 and in 1935 Danie Craven captained Stellenbosch University on a tour of the region; though none of these encounters included a match against a representative East Africa team.\nThe first representative team called East Africa are recorded facing the Cape Town University team that toured the region in late 1949 early 1950. Three matches were played in January 1950, East Africa losing each encounter. At this time, the East Africa team represented the colonies of British East Africa (Kenya Colony, Tanganyika and Uganda Protectorate) and the players were predominantly white settlers. (it was not until the 1960s that rugby's popularity spread and indigenous players started to take up the game; with time the East African team has seen a commensurate increase in the numbers of black players being selected).\nIn 1953 the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) was created in order to take over the mantle as the umbrella organisation for rugby in the region. The creation of the RFUEA allowed for the formation of the Tanganyika Rugby Football Union (TRFU) in 1954 and Uganda Rugby Football Union (URFU) in 1955. Each of these were essentially a sub-union of the RFUEA much as the district unions in Kenya were, so the RFU-K was dissolved in 1956 allowing the already existing district unions to deal directly with the RFUEA.\nThe formation of the RFUEA was just in time for the East Africa representative side's first tour, the First Tuskers Tour of the Copperbelt in 1954. It also gave the team slightly more official status though little, if anything, had changed with regard to the management of the team. Tuskers tours to the Copperbelt became somewhat of a tradition, six of the eight Tuskers tours have been to this rugby stronghold in southern Africa; a region that can provide an appropriate level of opposition and at a distance that does not strain the purse-strings of the players and unions alike. The only Tuskers tours not to the Copperbelt were toEngland (1966) and Ireland (1972).\nA year after the first tour, East Africa faced the British Lions in the first game played at the recently constructed \"headquarters\" of East African rugby, the RFUEA Ground and during the next six years welcomed other touring sides from the United Kingdom and South Africa including the Barbarians and South Africa and several prestigious university and military teams.\nThe Second Tuskers Tour took place in 1962 and again East Africa's first game at home after returning from a tour was against the British Lions. Between 1963 and 1966 several clubs and universities toured East Africa and played against the full representative side including, in 1964, Wales. Tours from South Africa were no longer welcomed as Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were participating in the boycott protesting the apartheid regime in that country.\nIn the six years between the Third (1966) and Fourth (1972) Tuskers tours fifteen high-profile clubs from the United Kingdom and the Irish Republic toured the region and played matches against East Africa, including Richmond FC, Blackheath FC, Harlequins FC and Blackrock College RFC, several touring twice in those years so enamoured were they by the region and their welcome. The fixtures played by East Africa at this time demonstrate clearly that outgoing tours create contacts and the desire amongst foreign clubs to come to East Africa and the converse also, incoming tours then generate invitations to conduct external visits.\nAfter the fifth Tuskers tour there was only one more British club to visit East Africa because the Rugby Football Union refused to participate in the anti-apartheid boycott of South Africa, as a result clubs administered by the RFU were no longer welcome. It is during this period that East Africa saw an increase in touring sides from France (including ACBB, Club Sportif Municipal (CSM) Clamart and ASCO ONERA), Italy (Including Rugby Roma Olimpic), Argentina (Old Georgians and various islands in the Indian Ocean (Réunion and Mauritius).\nMajor Internationals.\nWhen the British Lions went to South Africa for their 1955 and 1962 tours, they played East Africa in Nairobi on the return legs of their journeys. The Lions won both of these games, 39-12 and 50–0 respectively. The 1955 game was East Africa's first international and also saw the official opening of the team's home stadium, the RFUEA Ground, then called the Ngong Road Ground.\nIn 1958, East Africa hosted the Barbarians on their first tour of Africa. The Barbarians, managed by Brigadier Glyn Hughes and captained by Scotland's Jim Greenwood, took in six matches, the first five all played in South Africa, but the final match of the tour was against East Africa. The game was played on 28 May, with the Barbarians winning 58–12, Tony O'Reilly scoring seven tries.\nEast Africa would also play against South Africa in 1961 (losing 39–0), and Wales on their 1964 tour of Africa. Wales' game, held at the RFUEA Ground, Nairobi, on 12 May 1964, was the first time that they had played a match outside of Europe and therefore also their first in the Southern Hemisphere, albeit a mere hundred miles from the Equator. Wales won the match, 26–8.\nPrior to the introduction of standard numbering systems, many teams would wear numbers (or in the case of Bristol RFC and Leicester FC, letters) in a different order to that known today. The first set of East African jerseys was numbered from fullback (1) to scrum-half (7) followed by looshead prop (8) to Number-8 (15). It must also be remembered that prior to the innovation, by Sherborne School, in the 1960s of using the hooker to throw the ball into the line-out, this was the job of the winger. Thus there are photos of East African matches with the unusual combination of a winger, numbered 2 or 5, throwing in to a line of eight forwards, numbered 8 to 15.\nBritish Lions 1955.\nFive and a half years after their first match against the University of Cape Town, East Africa played their first international match against the British Lions, as they returned home from their 1955 tour of South Africa.\nThe Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA) took the opportunity of the 1955 match to invite the Lions manager (J.A.E. Siggins) to officially open their newly built national stadium, the RFUEA Ground (then called the \"Ngong Road Ground\") prior to kick-off. The capacity crowd of 6000 was treated to a magnificent display of running handling rugby that had characterised the tourists' games in South Africa.\nAccording to the match programme, East Africa fielded seven players who were winning their first cap, Brodziak, Chambers, Darroch, MacLean, Meintjes, Tippett and Wheeler. In addition East Africa selected two reserves and the Lions one; although substitutions were not allowed it was usual to select reserves at this time in case a player did not arrive on time or was unable to start the match. The match programme also states that Frank Sykes (Northampton &amp; ), Robin Roe (Lansdowne &amp; ) and Tom Reid (Garryowen &amp; ) had been selected to play this match, but the Lions' archives suggest that ultimately they did not. It appears that the reserve Bryn Meredith and Billy Williams (who had been assigned as the Lions touch-judge) were called upon to start in place of Roe and R.H. Williams while D.G.S. Baker was required to fill in for Sykes. East Africa took the field as advertised in the programme.\nOne of the contemporary match reports was written by Tony Coxall, a 13-year-old pupil from Arusha School in Tanzania who attended the match as part of a school trip in which twenty boys undertook the five-and-a-half-hour, journey to Nairobi in a 1.5 ton lorry. In this report it is stated that the Lions scored two tries before East Africa answered with a penalty and that at half time the score was 6-19. It also states that the seats cost 1 shilling each and that the crowd were entertained by the band of the Royal Irish Fusiliers at half-time.\nAs was usual for touring teams visiting East Africa during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, the Lions were given private hospitality as opposed to staying in hotels. Cliff Morgan, Haydn Morris and Gareth Griffiths (all players with Cardiff RFC) stayed with Mr. and Mrs. Arthur \"Pat\" Bryant, who had played for Cardiff prior to World War I, and who was an official of the East African Rugby Union. He had refereed for the RFUEA (in his blue and black Cardiff jersey) until his retirement at about 63 years of age. The tourists also encountered another former Cardiff player from the 1940s, Captain Howell Loveluck who was in Kenya as chaplain to the British Forces stationed there at the time of the Mau Mau Uprising.\nThere is a frequently repeated urban legend that Idi Amin (later to become the infamous military dictator of Uganda) was selected as a replacement by East Africa for their match against the 1955 British Lions. The story is entirely unfounded, he does not appear on the team list or in the team photograph and replacements were first introduced into international rugby 13 years after this event is supposed to have taken place. Mike Gibson of Ireland is generally recognised as being the first ever replacement in a rugby union match (he came on for the injured Barry John during the first test in Pretoria on the 1968 British Lions tour to South Africa). The first replacement for East Africa was Douglas \"Dougie\" Hamilton who came on in the 1968 match versus Queen's University (Belfast) R.F.C.\nBarbarian F.C. 1958.\nThe Barbarians, managed by Brigadier HL Glyn-Hughes and H Waddell, had just completed a successful tour of South Africa and stopped off in Nairobi on their way home. Members of this team who had previously visited Nairobi with the 1955 Lions were RH Williams, AJF O'Reilly, REG Jeeps, HF McLeod, JT Greenwood, CI Morgan, AR Smith and AC Pedlow. RH Davies had previously toured with the 1957 Combined (Oxford and Cambridge) Universities side.\nThe match was played before a capacity crowd in the late afternoon to early evening on a Wednesday; the papers reported that the colony's Legislative Council (Legco.) had adjourned early that day before cryptically referring to the Barbarian game later in the same paragraph by way of an oblique explanation. The visitors playing champagne rugby in the highest traditions of their club. Tony O'Reilly scored seven tries, no doubt making up for the fact that he had been injured and unable to play when he had come to Nairobi with the Lions three years earlier. East Africa's first try was scored by RN Angus of Kenya Harlequins, the first scored by East Africa on their Ngong Road ground.\nSpringboks 1961.\nIn 1960–61, the Springboks undertook a four-month tour of the United Kingdom and France, winning all their 43 matches except for a 0–0 draw against France and a 6–0 defeat by the Barbarians at Cardiff in what is often inaccurately listed as the final match of that tour. They left London on Wednesday February 22 by air, landing in Nairobi for a four-day stopover in Kenya on their way back to Johannesburg and, on Saturday 25 February 1961, they played East Africa. This was the only meeting between these teams, quite possibly the first match between South Africa and another African \"nation\", but unequivocally the true last match of the tour.\nThe final score was 39–0, the half-time score having been 15–0 with South Africa piling on a further 21 points within a quarter of an hour of the beginning of the second half, though the flood gates were closed for the rest of the match with the Springboks then only scoring once more. Johannes \"Hannes\" Botha (a flanker) and Gideon \"Giepie\" Wentzel (a full-back) played out of position.\nBritish Lions 1962.\nAlmost exactly seven years after hosting the 1955 Lions, East Africa faced the Lions again on the same ground, this time as they were returning from their 1962 tour to South Africa. At half time the score was 0 – 29\nWales 1964.\nIn 1964 the Welsh national team undertook their first overseas tour, a five-match tour of Africa. They left London on Sunday May 10 flying to Nairobi, arriving on Monday morning. They played their first ever match outside Europe (and thus their first match in the Southern Hemisphere) against East Africa on Tuesday May 12, winning 26–8, before flying to Cape Town on Wednesday.\nWelsh captain Clive Rowlands dictated the patterns of play and orchestrated many of the fine Welsh moves. The Welsh tries were great efforts, especially Dewi Bebb's who snatched a chance from a lineout three yards from the line and dived over before the opposition could lay a finger on him. The East African team fought valiantly and often caused the visitors defence problems with strong surging runs; their star player was Eric Weaver a Welshman serving in Nairobi with the RAF, he had previously played professional football with Swindon town. The Welsh fly-half in this match (Marsden Young) had not been – and was not subsequently – capped by Wales. As this match was not regarded as a full test by the Welsh Union so this player does not appear on the List of Wales national rugby union players.\nThe remaining four matches of the tour were in South Africa, who were celebrating the 75th anniversary of the South African Rugby Board. The first of these was played on May 19 against Boland at Wellington which they won 17–6. The test-match against South Africa, played at King's Park, Durban on May 23, was lost 3–24. The final two games were played on May 27 and May 30 against Northern Transvaal at Pretoria (lost 9–22) and the Orange Free State at Bloemfontein (won 14–6).\nIt was the lack of success experienced by the team on this tour that is credited with sparking the Welsh Rugby Union into action, appointing their first national coach and reaping the rewards with their fabled teams of the 1970s.\nTuskers tours.\nThe \"Tuskers\" is the nickname of the East Africa rugby union team but it is used exclusively when they are on tour. In all matches played at home they are referred to as \"East Africa\". By the time of the first Tuskers tour in 1954, East Africa had played three matches, all against the touring University of Cape Town team from South Africa, and the RFUEA badge had been adopted. When their first tour was being organised a few uncharitable nicknames were suggested for the team and thus the Tuskers moniker was quickly adopted and an appropriate emblem designed.\nFirst Tuskers Copperbelt Tour 1954.\nThe idea of an East African rugby touring team was first broached while the Kenya athletics team was visiting the Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) in 1953. The manager of that team was Archie Evans, a member of the Nondescripts RFC in Nairobi and he was able to communicate this proposal to the fledgling Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA). The tour took several months to organise, the process being hindered by the postal delays between the RFUEA, the Northern Rhodesian Rugby Union and its subsidiary, the Northern Rhodesian Congo Border Rugby Union. It was eventually decided that the latter of these would host the tour and permissions were sought from the respective governing bodies (the South African Rugby Board for Rhodesia and the Rugby Football Union in London for East Africa).\nThe delays during the planning meant that there was no time to stage trials. Instead the recently played first ever match between Kenya and Tanganyika was used to select the majority of the players that were to go on the tour. Arrangements were finalised just two weeks before departure; unfortunately one of the best players East Africa ever produced, A.I. McLean, was unable to take part as the hastily arranged tour coincided with his wedding. Most of the organisational work had been carried out by C.F. Schermbrucker (acting President of the RFUEA), Owen Wheeler (Hon Secretary RFUEA) and Mr. R.E. Luyt who had previously lived and played rugby in the Copperbelt.\nThe team, managed by A.K. Fyfe and Andrew G. Clark, left by air from Nairobi West on 17 August 1954.\nPlayed 8 matches, won 7 and lost 1 (to the Copperbelt XV).\nSecond Tuskers Copperbelt Tour 1962.\nIn 1962 the Tuskers, captained By Chris Young, toured the Copperbelt region of Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) for the second time. They played seven matches winning two; those played against Ndola and Mufulira.\nThird Tuskers England tour 1966.\nSeptember 1966, Toured England. Captain was Brian Granville-Ross, Manager was Balf Laing, Assistant Manager was Peter Griffiths.\nPlayed against Richmond F.C., Blackheath F.C., Anti-Assassins, Wilmslow RUFC, Vale of Lune RUFC, Harlequin F.C. and Fylde. All matches were lost.\nFourth Tuskers Ireland Tour 1972.\nThis tour took place in September 1972. The team played eight matches winning three.\nSixth Tuskers Zambia Tour 1979.\nAt the culmination of the 1978 tour to Zambia by Kenya an invitation was issued to the Tuskers to tour Zambia in 1979 to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the First Tuskers Tour. The second ever match between East Africa and Zambia took place on this tour with East Africa winning 21–13, thus evening up the record. Jackson Omaido (Mean Machine) was tour Captain.\nSeventh Tuskers Zambia and Zimbabwe Tour 1982.\nThe entire squad consisted of Kenyan players with the exception of David Nsubuga of Uganda. Rob Bertram, then chairman of Nondescripts RFC, was the tour manager and Jackson Omaido (Harlequins) was the Captain. Rodney Evans (Nondescripts) was player-coach and took over the captain's role with Omaido injured ahead of the test against Zimbabwe.\nList of Matches.\nAll matches played at RFUEA Ground (Nairobi, Kenya) except for those on a Tuskers tour (indicated by a grey background).\nNotable personalities.\nThe first black player to represent East Africa was J.K. \"Ted\" Kabetu (Mombasa Sports Club), who played on the wing against Richmond F.C. in 1972: he was also the first black rugby player at Mombasa Sports Club and, in 1974, the first black player to captain a rugby club in East Africa. Another Nairobi School former pupil, Chris Onsotti (then of Impala R.F.C., later of Mwamba R.F.C.) was the first black player to represent East Africa as a forward, playing prop on the Fourth Tuskers tour of Ireland 1972.\nThere is a frequently repeated urban myth that Idi Amin was selected as a replacement by the team for their 1955 match against the British Lions, while still a sergeant in the King's African Rifles. While Amin did play club rugby at the time, he does not appear in the team photograph or on the official team list.\nParticipating Unions.\nThe members of this team are drawn from players who qualify to be selected for:\nNotes.\na. In the 1960s, rugby teams started separating backs and forwards in practice as the game had evolved such that their functions and tactics became increasingly disconnected. The Sherborne School team (under their coaches M.M. Walford and H.F.W. Holmes) began to use the hooker to throw the ball in to line-outs at practice rather than disrupt the rehearsal of moves by the backs. It followed logically that having practiced the technique the hooker should throw in the ball during matches, particularly as the opposition would be required to reduce their line-out to seven players in order to match the throwing teams numbers. This tactic was taken to Oxford University by the Sherborne hooker, D.M. Barry, from where it has spread to become accepted practise throughout the world.\nb. The Evans family has had a great influence on the development of rugby in East Africa, but Dicky Evans, though he shares the same surname and was, like them, a member of Nondescripts RFC, is not part of this family. Dicky was later to become owner and then president of the Cornish Pirates rugby team in the United Kingdom.\nc. East Africa's original jerseys from the 1950s and early 1960s were numbered from fullback (1) to scrum-half (7) followed by looshead prop (8) to Number-8 (15)."

        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 18, 20 and 21st at the Montreal Forum. There were 90 competitors from 20 nations. Each nation could send a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union, the nation's fourth victory in the event (matching Italy for most among nations at that point). It was the Soviets' return to the podium in the event after a one-Games absence in 1972 snapped a five-Games medal streak. Japan, which had swept the medals in 1972, took silver and bronze this time. Two-time defending champion Sawao Kato finished second, becoming the first man to earn three medals in the men's all-around and the most decorated man in the event's history (later tied by Kōhei Uchimura with two golds and a silver from 2008 to 2016). Mitsuo Tsukahara earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFour of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1972 Games returned: two-time gold medalist Sawao Kato of Japan, silver medalist (and 1968 fourth-place finisher) Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan, fourth-place finisher Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union, and eighth-place finisher Mitsuo Tsukahara of Japan. Reigning (1974) World Champion Shigeru Kasamatsu of Japan missed the 1976 Games with an emergency appendectomy; Andrianov had been the runner-up with Kenmotsu third.\nIsrael made its debut in the event. France and Italy both made their 15th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format followed the preliminary and final format introduced in 1972, but placed a limit on the number of finalists per nation. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final, with the top 36 gymnasts advancing to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these scores plus half of the preliminary score resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. With half of the preliminary score and six more exercises scored 0 to 10, the final total was also from 0 to 120.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals.\nResults.\nNinety gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 18 and 20. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 21. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes each gymnast's \"prelim\" score."

        "title": "John Murray (ice hockey, born 1987)",
        "text": "John Murray (born July 4, 1987) is an American-Polish professional ice hockey goaltender currently playing for GKS Katowice in the Polska Hokej Liga. In 2014, he won the PHL playoff championship with Ciarko PBS Bank KH Sanok and again in 2018 and 2019 with GKS Tychy. He also plays for the Poland men's national ice hockey team.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nMurray played minor hockey with the Philadelphia Jr. Flyers until the age of 16. At 16 years of age, Murray left home for Youngstown, Ohio, to play for the North American Hockey League's Youngstown Phantoms. He played in 21 games that season. For the next two seasons, Murray played for the United States Hockey League's Sioux Falls Stampede, where his teammates included T. J. Oshie, Andreas Nödl, Jay Barriball and Alex Kangas. In his first season with Sioux Falls, Murray had a dismal record of 7–13–2 and a goals-against average of 3.24 but he still managed to have a save percentage of .902%, thanks mostly to one shutout. The next season, Murray had a GAA of 2.14 while allowing only 68 goals, the same as he did the year before, as well as a much-improved record of 23–7–1 and three shutouts. He also had a save percentage of .930%, both of which were second-best in the USHL that season. Murray and teammate Alex Kangas found themselves both ranked in the Final Central Scouting for the 2006 NHL Entry Draft for North American goaltenders with Kangas ranked tenth and Murray ranked 22nd. (Both had slipped through the draft the year before.) Kangas was chosen 135th overall by the Atlanta Thrashers but Murray was not drafted.\nMurray then began to contemplate his future. He considered playing for the University of Maine but he did not have a scholarship. His agent then contacted him with a job offer with the OHL's Kitchener Rangers. The Rangers had lost their #1 goaltender, Dan Turple, to graduation after being signed by Atlanta. On May 25, 2006, considering the length of the OHL schedule, Murray signed with the Rangers, eventually taking the #1 job away from sophomore goaltender Mark Packwood. After Packwood was traded to the Oshawa Generals, rookie Charles Lavigne (now with the Québec Remparts) backed up Murray for the rest of the 2006–07 OHL season. Murray finished the 2006–07 season with a record of 40–9–3, a 2.58 GAA, a .909% save percentage and five shutouts. He represented the Western Conference at the 2007 OHL All-Star Classic in Saginaw, Michigan.\nDuring the 2007 offseason, Murray was signed to a professional tryout contract by the Columbus Blue Jackets. During a game against the rookies of the Dallas Stars, former OHL foe James Neal cross-checked Murray in the shoulder after making a save. The cross-check separated Murray's shoulder and it broke his collarbone in two places. Thinking that he would have had a spot on the Syracuse Crunch, Murray was sent back to Kitchener as an overage player. The Rangers, however, had two new rookie goaltenders, Josh Unice and Mavric Parks, as well as three overagers already on their roster. On December 7, 2007, the Rangers traded Murray to the Kingston Frontenacs, who desperately needed a goalie after Anthony Peters was hit by a car and broke his leg in an accident in Windsor. The next night, Murray was in goal for his first game of the 2007–08 season, starting against his former team. He allowed six goals on 50 shots against. On January 25, 2008, Murray was involved in a fight with Niagara IceDogs goaltender Lucas Lobsinger which resulted in a two-game suspension. Murray finished the season with a 12–15–1 record, a 3.78 goals-against average and a .901% save percentage. During his two OHL seasons, Murray also accumulated 37 penalty minutes.\nProfessional.\nAfter the Kingston Frontenacs missed the playoffs in 2008, Murray was signed by the ECHL's Reading Royals. In his first ECHL start, against the Elmira Jackals at First Arena in Elmira, New York, he recorded a 38-save shutout en route to being named the first star of the game. In the summer of 2008, Murray was signed to the ECHL's newest franchise, the Ontario Reign. Murray did well in Ontario, earning a berth at the 2009 ECHL All-Star Game in Reading. After Jeff Zatkoff came back from an injury, however, Murray found himself traded to the now-defunct Mississippi Sea Wolves in February 2009. He played in only two games for Mississippi, both of them losses. During the period of time between the ECHL All-Star Game and his trade, Murray was recalled by the Syracuse Crunch while Dan LaCosta was recalled by the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nIn the summer of 2009, Murray was signed to a two-way contract between the Manitoba Moose of the AHL and the Victoria Salmon Kings of the ECHL. After starting the 2009/10 season with the Salmon Kings, his job was taken away when the Calgary Flames assigned both David Shantz and Matt Keetley to the team. Murray was claimed by the Johnstown Chiefs, an ECHL team in his home state of Pennsylvania. With the Chiefs having folded, Murray was to return to the Salmon Kings in 2010/11; instead, he opted to sign with HK Partizan as a free agent. As a Partizan Murray had an outstanding season. He posted a 1.97 GAA (goals against average) and a 0.933 save percentage in the regular season and led his team to victory over the HK Olimpija to become the 2010–2011 Slohokej League Champions and later Serbian Hockey League Champions. In the Serbian Hockey League Championships against the KHK Crvena Zvezda Murray in two games posted a 0.951 save percentage and a 1.5 GAA."

It was created on 14 October 1988 in Asunción on the initiative of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay, counting with a total of 16 unions.\nThe confederation currently has nine full World Rugby member nations, with one associate member, and is responsible for running various rugby tournaments within South America, especially the South American Rugby Championship.\nHistory.\nAlthough there was a meeting of associations during the 1961 Championship, the body was officially established as \"Confederación Sudamericana de Rugby\" (South American Rugby Confederation) on October 14, 1988, in the Yacht and Golf Club of Asunción, Paraguay. The act of foundation was signed by members of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay.\nThe members also set up the Copa Libertadores de Rugby, contested by the national champions of each association, to be held in Punta del Este. According with the act, the Confederation was created with the aim of promoting the spreading and development of amateur rugby within South America, and organising rugby competitions in the region.\nFollowing a suggestion made by World Rugby, the Confederation changed its name to \"Sudamérica Rugby\" in 2015.\nIn 2019, Sudamérica Rugby announced the creation of \"Superliga Americana\", the first professional competition in the region. To begin in February 2020, the tournament will be contested by five clubs of five countries, playing in a double round-robin basis. At the end of the regular phase, the four best placed teams will qualify to play the semi-finals, while team placed 5th. will play two matches versus the Colombian representative, which added in 2021.\nFranchised team Ceibos, based in Córdoba and made up of players from Argentina XV and Jaguares, will represent Argentina at the competition. Former \"Puma\" Ignacio Fernández Lobbe was appointed as coach of Los Ceibos. The other teams taking part in the tournament will be Corinthians (Brazil), Selknam (Chile), Cafeteros Pro (Colombia), Olimpia Lions (Paraguay), and Peñarol (Uruguay).\nWorld Cup qualifying.\nSudamérica Rugby nations participate in qualifying tournaments for the Rugby World Cup every four years. Three Sudamérica Rugby nations –Argentina, Uruguay and Chile – have qualified to play in Rugby World Cups."

        "title": "Comparison of Canadian football and rugby union",
        "text": "A comparison of Canadian football and rugby union is possible because of the games' shared origins, despite their dissimilarities.\nMost significant differences.\nThe most significant difference in play is the allowance of blocking for the ball carrier, which is to say preventing a defender from tackling the player with the ball. This rule in Canadian football allows top-flight teams to include hundreds of different plays in each and every match. It also slows the game down, causing frequent stoppages and less spontaneity in play. The laws against this in rugby union allow for each team to contest possession at all stages of a game. This determines the fluid and rapid nature of rugby where possession of the ball may change back and forth between teams without a break in play for long periods. This means that although rugby teams practice and execute a large number of pre-rehearsed plays the players at the top level especially must be quick thinking and tactically adept to cope with an unpredictable, fast moving game.\nComposition of teams.\nProfessional and most scholastic Canadian football team play has evolved from a single team with all players except limited substitutions playing the entire game, to a specialized \"platoon\" system consisting of three separate units (offensive, defensive, and \"special teams\" used for kicking and punting) with only one of the three being on the field at a time. That is to say that in Professional Canadian football, the majority of players only play in one specialization (or \"one side of the ball\") -- however, every player is eligible to play in any specialization. In rugby the teams are divided into eight forwards and seven backs. Both groups of players partake on attacking and defensive plays and are on the pitch at the same time. The eight forwards however only take part in the \"set pieces\" which are ways to contest ball possession when there is a minor rule infringement or the ball passes out of bounds. These are the scrums, a test of strength, and the line outs. A person's build and skill level determines which group they can play in. All forwards must be heavy and strong to scrummage well but not so heavy that they are too slow to partake in attacking plays. The backs are lighter and faster and include the expert kickers. The forwards numbered 6 through 8 are the players that need to have good all round rugby skills as well as speed and strength. In professional rugby there are very few players who can play equally well in a variety of positions and most will play in the same position from youth. Every position in rugby has its own unique name (except for number 8) and associated skill base.\nIn the majority of club and schoolhouse Canadian Football the majority of players play both offence and defence only being substituted for injury. Substitutes in Canadian football can return to the game at any stoppage in play. In rugby union, any player substituted off for any reason except for minor bleeding is not allowed to return to the game (with the possible exception of front-row forwards). Rugby teams may make up to eight substitutions. There are fifteen players on the pitch at all times. Players who are verified as bleeding by an independent medical official are sent to the \"blood bin,\" where they can receive medical treatment, and replaced until they have stopped bleeding. Ejected players in Canadian football can be replaced with a substitute, while in rugby union ejection means the team must play a man down the remainder of the game. This is known as being \"red carded\" and is punishment for especially dangerous play. Players who are red carded typically are banned for a number of games or even permanently.\nDuration of game.\nA rugby union game is divided into two halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower grade games) separated by a 10-minute half time period. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball is kicked into touch, a team scores, or the losing side commits a penalty. Time may also be added onto each half at the referee's discretion to make up for time lost due to treatment of injuries, etc. (this usually amounts to less than 5 minutes). Most commonly, however, the clock will be stopped by the referee to allow for treatment of injured players during the game, removing the need for added injury time. In contrast Canadian football matches are made up of four quarters of 15 minutes each, but the clock stops and starts according to specific rules, so that the 15 minutes quarter lasts slightly longer. In the professional (televised) version of this sport the game is often paused for the airing of commercials and advertisements; this does not occur outside of the televised environment where breaks in play are comparable to those in rugby union. In addition to this, the half time break is typically 12- to 15-minutes; this intermission allows for resetting of strategy in both rugby and Canadian football and adjusting to the opponents schemes. During the period entertainment is played for the crowd, ranging from marching band performances in high school and college games to big-name entertainment (e.g. Black Eyed Peas and The Tragically Hip) for the Grey Cup. The entertainment in rugby varies from club to club but traditionally would involve a band performance. The typical game in a non-televised environment lasts for around 120 minutes.\nGame play.\nRugby union matches are timed for 80 minutes, in two 40-minute halves. Canadian football games are timed for two 30-minute halves, each of which is further divided into 15-minute quarters.\nIn both sports, the primary objective of the game is to carry the ball over the opponents goal line. In both sports the ball may be passed backwards an unlimited number of times, but in Canadian football the ball may be passed forward and sideways as long as the passer is behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to rugby union where the ball cannot be passed but only kicked forward. The secondary scoring objective is to kick the ball through the opponents goalposts and over its crossbar.\nIn Canadian football, \"play\" is stopped when a player is ruled down or out of bounds, whereas the play in rugby union continues until a player or the ball goes out of bounds, a player/team commits a foul or a player scores.\nThe forward pass and the stoppage when a player is grounded results in short plays and a generally staccato game play in Canadian football, as opposed to the longer and more fluid passages of play found in rugby union. If a player in rugby is tackled then the ball must be released and any player arriving at the scene may pick up the ball and run with it. If two or more opposing players arrive at the same time then a ruck is formed and the players push each other to get at the ball before play continues. Rugby therefore involves far more running and less scrimmaging than Canadian football.\nIn Canadian football, each team is allowed to stop the game clock one time per half (referred to as \"timeouts\"), and the officials will also stop the clock when there are three minutes to play in each half (referred to as the \"Three minute warning\"). There are no such stoppages in rugby. The game clock in Canadian football is also stopped at various times depending on how the previous play ended; for example if the ball carrier runs out of bounds, or if a forward pass is incomplete.\nOrigins.\nVarious forms of football have been played in Britain for centuries with different villages and schools having their own traditional rules. Rugby-like games were first introduced into Canada by British soldiers and colonists in the mid-1800s. However at that time a standard set of rules did not exist and teams would negotiate the rules before playing a game.\nThe Football Association was formed in England in October 1863. Differences of opinion about the proposed laws led to the formation of the first governing body for rugby in 1871 the Rugby Football Union. Laws were drawn up for rugby football which was now distinct from Association football (soccer).\nRugby football proper in Canada dates back to the 1860s. Introduction of the game and its early growth is usually credited to settlers from Britain and the British army and navy in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Esquimalt, British Columbia.\nIn 1864 the first recorded game of rugby in Canada took place in Montreal amongst artillery men. It is most likely that rugby got its start in British Columbia in the late 1860s or early 1870s when brief mentions of \"football\" appeared in print.\nF. Barlow Cumberland and Fred A. Bethune first codified rules for rugby football in Canada, in 1865 at Trinity College, Toronto, and the first proper Canadian game of rugby took place in 1865 when officers of an English regiment played local civilians, mainly from McGill University.\nRugby is also an ancestor of Canadian football, currently its main competitor. A \"running game\", resembling rugby, was taken up by the Montreal Football Club in Canada in 1868.\nBack in England, a schism developed between those who favoured strict amateurism and those who felt that players should be compensated for time taken off work to play rugby. In 1895, this resulted in the formation of a break-away governing body, the Northern Union.\nThe Northern Union began to make changes to the laws of rugby in 1906, which resulted in the sport of rugby league. The Rugby Football Union's version of rugby became as known as rugby union after its governing body.\nThe field.\nDimensions.\nAlthough both codes are played on similar sized rectangular fields, the dimensions of rugby union fields can vary up to maximum size that is larger than the fixed size of Canadian football fields. Rugby union fields are limited to a maximum length of 144 m long (and 100 m between goal lines) and width of 70 m, while Canadian football fields have a fixed length of 150 yd (137 m) long and width of 160 ft (48.8 m). Both sets of measurements include scoring zones at each end. These are fixed to 20 yd and called the end zone in Canadian football, but of unspecified length in rugby union.\nThe Canadian football field is long and wide with end zones deep. At each goal line is a set of goalposts, which consist of two \"uprights\" joined by a crossbar which is above the goal line. The goalposts may be H-shaped (both posts fixed in the ground) although in the higher-calibre competitions the tuning-fork design (supported by a single curved post behind the goal line, so that each post starts above the ground) is preferred.\nLines.\nThe border between the regular field of play and a scoring zone is called the \"goal line\" in Canadian football and the \"try line\" in rugby union. The outer perimeters of both fields are demarcated with sidelines (ends of rugby union field border the scoring zone being called \"dead ball lines\" and longitudinal sides \"touch lines\"). The central playing field of rugby is divided into halves by a \"halfway line\"; however, when the Canadian football field was marked, the centre line was marked as 55yards or C which stands for centre.\nAdditional lines differ markedly with Canadian football fields marked at every 5 yard interval, whereas rugby union fields only have two further solid lines called the \"22 metre lines\" and four broken lines each halving a half (resulting in four quarters and being translated as \"quarter lines\" in some languages). The dotted lines are made of two \"10 metre lines\" on each side of the halfway line and two \"5 metre lines\" before each goal line. Rugby union fields also have another set of dotted \"5 metre lines\".\nThe yard lines in Canadian football are vitally important during game play, because a team's advance is measured against these lines, which in turn determines ball possession, whereas the halfway, \"22\" and \"10 yards lines\" only determine the position of players during various rugby union kick-offs (which could be from the halfway line or \"22s\") or line-out in the case of the broken line 5 yd from the side lines.\nGoalposts.\nBoth codes also have goalposts at each end of the field: on the goal line in the case of rugby union, same as in Canadian football. Canadian football goalposts consist of two vertical posts 18.5 feet apart (24 feet in high school football) rising from a horizontal crossbar mounted on single (usually) post raising it 10 ft off the ground (resulting in a combined Y-shape of sorts). Rugby union goalposts are 5.6 m (18.3 ft) apart and extend vertically from the ground being connected by a crossbar at 3 m (9.8 ft), creating an H-shape. In both cases, only kicks passing between the uprights and above the crossbar score points. The scoring areas of both types of goalposts are therefore similar.\nAdvancing the ball.\nIn Canadian football, the team that is in possession of the ball, the offence, has three downs to advance the ball 10 yards towards the opponent's end zone. If the offence gains 10 yards, it gets another set of three downs. If the offence fails to gain 10 yards after 3 downs, it loses possession of the ball.\nThe ball is put into play by a snap. All players line up facing each other at the line of scrimmage. One offensive player, the centre, then passes (or \"snaps\") the ball between his legs to a teammate, usually the quarterback.\nPlayers can then advance the ball in two ways:\nA down ends, and the ball becomes dead, after any of the following:\nRugby union is based on the 'right to contest possession'. A team is not required to surrender possession when the ball carrier is tackled, in contrast to Canadian football, where a team must surrender their possession when a player is tackled and no downs remain. Rugby union players must win possession in open play, unless the team in possession makes an infringement, scores, or the ball leaves the field of play.\nA team in rugby union can advance the ball in two ways:\nIn rugby the method of attack is typically decided by the person in the number ten jersey (the flyhalf). Once the forwards gain possession of the ball after a scrum, line out or ruck the ball is usually passed to this player who is the midpoint between the forwards and the backs. He/she must read the oppositions defensive strategy and calls a play accordingly either running, passing or kicking to other players. After the set piece or ruck the no.10 is the first player who has time to control the play and must therefore be an expert at a wide variety of kicks and an expert passer. The rule differences mean that there are a wider variety of kicks and kicking strategies in rugby compared to Canadian football.\nPossession may change in different ways in both games:\nIn both codes, tactical kicking is an important aspect of play. In Canadian football, it is normal to punt on the last down, but, as in rugby union, a kick can take place at any phase of play.\nPassing.\nIn Canadian football, the offence can throw the ball forward once on a play from behind the line of scrimmage. The forward pass is a distinguishing feature of Canadian football as it is strictly forbidden in rugby.\nThe ball can be thrown sideways or backwards without restriction in both games. In Canadian football this is known as a lateral and is much less common than in rugby union.\nIn both codes, if the ball is caught by an opposition player this results in an interception and possession changes hands.\nTackles and blocks.\nIn both games it is permitted to bring down the player in possession of the ball and prevent them making forward progress. In rugby, unlike in Canadian football, the ball is still in play. Players from either team can take possession of the ball. The tackled player must present the ball (release the ball) so that open play can continue.\nRugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The arms of the attacker must also wrap around the player being tackled. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\nIn Canadian football, tacklers are not required to wrap their arms around the ball carrier before bringing him to the ground; in fact, the ball carrier is often \"tackled\" by the defender taking a running start and hitting the ball carrier to knock them to the ground. Tackles can also be made by grabbing the ball carrier's jersey and pulling him to the ground (though pulling down a ball carrier by the pads behind his neck is known as a \"horse collar\", a move now illegal at all levels of the Canadian game). If a ball carrier is stopped for more than a few seconds, the referee can blow the whistle, declare the player's forward progress stopped, and end the play even though the ball carrier is not actually tackled to the ground.\nIn Canadian football, players are allowed to 'block' players without the ball, this is not permitted in rugby union and would be considered 'obstruction', resulting in a penalty.\nScoring.\nA touchdown is the Canadian equivalent of a try. Unlike Canadian football, both codes of rugby require the ball to be grounded, whereas in Canadian football it is sufficient for the ball to enter the end zone (in-goal area) when in the possession of a player (making the term \"touchdown\" a misnomer). In Canadian football a touchdown scores 6 points; in rugby union a try is worth 5 points.\nIn both games, following a try / touchdown, there is the opportunity to score additional points by kicking the ball between the posts and over the bar. In Canadian football this is called an extra point (worth 1 point); in rugby union it is known as a conversion (worth 2 points). (The result is that both the touchdown/extra point combination and the try/conversion combination, when successful, total to 7 points.) One key difference between an extra point and a conversion is that a conversion kick must be taken from a position in line with where the try was scored, although the distance from the try line from which the conversion kick is taken is not fixed. Hence, it is advantageous to ground the ball under the posts rather than in the corner which makes for a more difficult kick. Also, Canadian football features the option of the going for a 2-point convert, where the attacking team gets one chance from 5 yards out to get the ball in the endzone again. This would be worth 2 points on top of the 6 already awarded for the touchdown.\nIn Canadian football teams often opt to go for a field goal (worth 3 points) rather than attempt a touchdown. The rugby equivalent is a drop goal (worth 3 points in union and only one in league). The key difference between a field goal and a drop goal is that a field goal attempt is normally kicked with a teammate holding the ball, whereas in rugby the ball must hit the ground and be kicked from a half-volley.\nA similar concept in rugby is the penalty goal. Following the award of the penalty, the attacking team may opt to kick for goal rather than advance the ball by hand or punting. This scores 3 points. The penalty goal is similar to a field goal in Canadian football in that the ball is kicked from the ground, but it cannot be charged. There is no direct equivalent to a penalty goal in Canadian football. A rare play called a \"fair catch kick\" is analogous to a goal from mark which existed in rugby union at one time.\nCanadian football has one further method of scoring which does not exist in rugby. If the team with possession causes the ball to enter their own endzone, and the ball carrier is then tackled while within the endzone, then this results in a safety which scores 2 points for the attacking team and results in the defending team having to kick the ball to the team who recorded it. In rugby union this does not score any points but results in a scrum 5 meters from the try zone with the tackling team in possession.\nIn Rugby, If the ball is kicked past the try line and the receiving team grounds it without returning to the field of play, a drop kick from the 22-metre line ensues. In Canadian football, if a kick-off or punt goes into the endzone and the receiving team downs it without leaving the endzone, the result is a \"rouge\" and the receiving team gains possession of the ball but give up a point to the punting team for failing to advance the ball out of the endzone.\nAn important difference between the two sports involves the aftermath of a score. In Canadian football, the scoring team kicks off, except after a safety. In rugby union, the team scored upon kicks off (in rugby sevens, a variant of rugby union featuring seven players per side, the scoring team kicks off).\nPlayers.\nCanadian teams have twelve players on the field per side. Different players may be interchanged at will for offence and defence as well as special teams for specific activities.\nA Canadian football team consists of an offensive unit, a defensive unit and a \"special teams\" unit (involved in kicking and kick returns). Twelve players can be on the field at any time. Players are allowed to play on more than one of the units, this is the norm for all but the highest levels of play (professional and large schools). The kicking unit, with the exception of a few specialists, is usually made up of reserve players from the offence and defence.\nIn both kinds of rugby the same players have to both defend and attack. There are fifteen players in a rugby union team (except in sevens and tens).\nMany of the positions in each code have similar names, but, in practice, the roles of those positions can be different. A fullback in Canadian football is very different from a fullback in rugby. Some of the positions are fairly similar; a Rugby fly-half carries out a similar role to a quarterback in Canadian football; however, quarterbacks touch the ball on almost every offensive play.\nBroadly speaking linemen and linebackers in Canadian football correspond to forwards in rugby, and running backs, receivers, and quarterbacks have roles similar to backs in rugby.\nBecause of the playing time, number of pauses, number of players and the nature of the game in general, rugby players will typically need higher physical endurance than Canadian football players while more short-term bursts of physical strength, power, and speed are required in Canadian football (amongst equivalent positions and weights). Collisions between players in rugby union tend to last significantly longer than Canadian football, in which collisions are more often \"hits\" in which the momentum of the player is enough to bring the other player to ground or at least forcing an error or fumble. In rugby union tackles must at least show an attempt to bind the opposing player. These hits are not usually at the speed of Canadian football both because of the nature of the game and the lack of protective equipment. Additionally, rugby offsides rules and the lack of a forward pass significantly reduce the chance of a player receiving a \"blind-side\" hit (i.e. being hit and/or tackled from behind). In Canadian football, players receiving a forward pass are often vulnerable because they must concentrate on catching the ball, often jumping very high or stretching out and thereby exposing their body to punishing hits; in rugby a player is not allowed to be tackled in the air, leaving the receiver of the kick with more time to assess his surroundings. Ball carriers in rugby can usually anticipate a hit and can brace themselves accordingly.\nIn rugby, the contact times between players are usually longer, as a more wrestling approach is required to bring players down, as momentum cannot always be relied upon particularly when the lines between the teams are consistently close, not allowing for significant momentum to be developed before meeting a defender. In rugby, rucks and mauls may develop following a tackle when multiple players from each team bind together to move the ball in play (on the ground or in-hand respectively). In Canadian football, equivalents to rucks and mauls are virtually non existent, as play stops when the ball carrier is stopped. This difference can be summed up in the idea that in Canadian football the objective is to bring the player to ground or to disrupt a pass to end the play, whereas in rugby the main objective is to stop the player from breaking the try line.\nCanadian football quarterbacks - and increasingly, their coaches - have several seconds to decide what the next play they will run in many occasions during the game, thus allowing for both complex tactics displayed within individual plays and overall game-wide strategy in play calling and play selection. In rugby union, the continuous nature of the game implies that there is no time to discuss team strategy, therefore offensive actions may seem to lack a definite direction for some periods of time. Rugby is more movement based than Canadian football in which short bursts are needed.\nRugby players often continue to participate in the game long after they have left school. In Canada, amateurs who have left school rarely play full tackle football, but often play touch football or flag football.\nAttire.\nRugby union players are allowed to wear modest padding on the head, shoulders and collarbone, but it must be sufficiently light, thin and compressible to meet IRB standards. The headguard, also called a \"scrum cap\", is now commonly worn throughout all levels of the game. Protective headgear which is becoming essential because of the quantity of cuts and head injuries that can occur, particularly by the boots of players involved in rucking. Hard plastic or metal are prohibited in rugby kit. This includes hard plastic shin guards. No form of metal is allowed in any rugby kit, except for IRB-approved soft aluminum studs on boots. An essential part of the safety equipment needed for rugby is the gumshield or mouthguard. Players also have the option to use fingerless gloves which have been introduced recently to the game allowing players to better grip the ball.\nCanadian football players wear much bulkier protective equipment, such as a padded plastic helmet, shoulder pads, hip pads and knee pads. These protective pads were introduced decades ago and have improved ever since to help minimize lasting injury to players. A Canadian football helmet consists of a hard plastic top with thick padding on the inside, a facemask made of one or more metal bars, and a chinstrap used to secure the helmet. An unintended consequence of all the safety equipment has resulted in increasing levels of violence in the game which unprotected would be extremely dangerous. In previous years with less padding, tackling more closely resembled tackles in rugby union, with less severe impacts and less severe structural injuries."

        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29 and 31 at the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona. There were 93 competitors from 25 nations. Each nation could enter a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Vitaly Scherbo, one of his six gold medals in 1992. The Unified Team, making its only Summer Olympics appearance, swept the medals, with Scherbo taking gold, Grigory Misutin silver, and Valery Belenky bronze. It was the second consecutive medal sweep in the event (the Soviet Union had done it in 1988) and fourth overall (France in 1900, Japan in 1972). \nBackground.\nThis was the 21st appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFive of the top 11 gymnasts (including a tie for tenth place) from the 1988 Games returned: fourth-place finisher Sven Tippelt of East Germany (now competing for unified Germany), fifth-place finisher Marius Gherman of Romania, sixth-place finisher Kalofer Khristozov of Bulgaria, eighth-place finisher Yukio Iketani of Japan, and tenth-place finisher Sylvio Kroll of East Germany (now Germany). The reigning (1991) World Champion was Grigory Misutin of the Soviet Union/Unified Team, with his teammate Vitaly Scherbo second. The 1989 World Champion (and 1992 European champion) Igor Korobchinsky, also of the Soviet Union/Unified Team, also competed in Barcelona.\nPuerto Rico and Slovenia each made their debut in the event. Some former Soviet republics competed together as the Unified Team. France made its 19th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nIn the first major format change since 1976 (when the number of gymnasts per nation in the final was limited to three), the 1992 Games ended the carryover of preliminary scores to the final. The preliminary round and final round were now separate. In the preliminary round (which also served as the team all-around competition as well as the qualifying round for the individual apparatus events), each gymnast performed a compulsory exercise and an optional exercise on each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. The top 36 gymnasts advanced to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these six exercise scores resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. The final total, with six exercises, was from 0 to 60.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals.\nResults.\nEighty-nine gymnasts competed in the all-around during the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 31. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final."

        "text": "The men's 5000 metres at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics were held at the Olympic Stadium on 20 and 23 August\nSummary.\nIn hindsight, this race was the confluence of many of the greats. Kenenisa Bekele was already the world record holder, the Woolworth double (5 and 10) Olympic champion and the champion at 10,000 here. At 27, this would be his last successful major championship race. At 35, Bernard Lagat (a Kenyan transplant to USA) would continue to medal internationally for another 5 years. Lagat was the defending champion and was the second fastest 1500 runner of all time. Eliud Kipchoge had the championship record from 2003 and would go on to greater fame in marathon running, winning the Olympic gold medal in 2016 and 2021. And setting the official world record in 2018 and the assisted world record in 2019. A lesser known British runner named Mo Farah was making his first World Championship final after disappointment in the 2008 Olympics. Two years later, he would go on to start a 6 year long major championship winning streak that would encompass two Olympics and four World Championships in both the 5 and 10.\nWith the mixture of strength runners like Bekele and Kipchoge, and kickers like Lagat and Farah, the strategy was a question mark. Could the strength runners burn off the kickers? Bekele started fast, and most of the field followed along in tow. Farah lagged 15 metres behind, 100 metres into the race. University of Wisconsin teammates Matt Tegenkamp and Chris Solinsky marked Bekele as the pace slowed at first. Bekele led with an uneven pace, running as fast as 60 seconds a lap and as slow as 64. Everybody else followed for 2300 metres until the Kenyan team, led by Joseph Ebuya all moved to the front as much to assert an even pace if not a fast pace. Bekele moved back to control the race, marked by Lagat, Kipchoge, Moses Ndiema Kipsiro and Kenyan transplant to Qatar, James Kwalia C'Kurui. Just under 800 metres to go, Ebuya stepped to the right and gave up. After coming to a virtual stop he jogged and rejoined the race well out of contention. The same five leaders remained together at the bell with Jesús España sprinting up to be in short lived contention. As they sped around the turn and into the backstretch, those five separated from the chasers. With España fading, Tegenkamp was the last left trying to bridge the gap. Bekele held the lead through the final turn, with Lagat moving into position to put his move on. Coming off the turn, Lagat pounced and took the lead, but only by inches. Side by side, Bekele on the inside and Lagat on the outside, the two sprinted shoulder to shoulder for 40 metres, then Bekele edged in front, slowly widening the gap for a little over a metre by the finish. Behind them Kwalia emerged from the group to take the bronze.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 5 in each heat(Q) and the next 5 fastest(q) advance to the final.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: SB = Seasonal best"

The competition was held on Saturday 27 July 1924. 43 riders from 11 nations competed. Nations were limited to four riders each; the team jumping event used the same results as this competition, with the top three individual scores counting for each national team. The individual event was won by Alphonse Gemuseus of Switzerland, with the nation winning its first victory in its debut in the individual jumping event. Tommaso Lequio di Assaba of Italy became the first person to win multiple medals in the event, taking silver to add to his 1920 gold. Adam Królikiewicz earned Poland's first individual jumping medal with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nThree riders from the 1920 competition returned: gold medalist Tommaso Lequio di Assaba of Italy, fourteenth-place finisher Åge Lundström of Sweden, and twenty-fifth-place finisher Jacques Misonne of Belgium. \nCzechoslovakia, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and Switzerland each made their debut in the event. Belgium and France both competed for the fourth time, the only nations to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1060 metre course consisted of 15 obstacles, which were up to 1.4 meters high.

The time limit for the course was 2:39 (400 metres per minute), with a penalty of 0.25 faults for every second or fraction thereof above the limit.\nThe faults possible were: 3 points for a first refusal, 6 for a second, elimination for a third; 5 points for a horse falling; 10 points for the rider being unseated; 4 points for knocking an obstacle down with the horse's fore legs, 2 point for knocking it down with the hind legs; and 2 points for going off-course.\nResults.\nThe course turned out to be rather difficult; the best pair finished with 6 faults."

        "title": "List of Giro d'Italia general classification winners",
        "text": "The Giro d'Italia is an annual road bicycle race held in May. Established in 1909 by newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\", the Giro is one of cycling's three \"Grand Tours\"; along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. The race usually covers approximately 3,500 kilometres (2,200 mi), passing through Italy and neighbouring countries such as France. The race is broken into day-long segments, called stages. Individual finishing times for each stage are totalled to determine the overall winner at the end of the race. The course changes every year, but has traditionally finished in Milan.\nThe rider with the lowest aggregate time at the end of each day is leader of the general classification, and since 1931 wears a pink jersey. Other classifications have also been added, and sometimes removed; the leaders of some of these classifications were also indicated with jerseys, whose colours have varied over the years. As of 2011, the red jersey is worn by the leader of the points classification; the green jersey is worn by the leader of the mountains classification and the white jersey is worn by the leader of the young rider classification.\nAlfredo Binda, Fausto Coppi and Eddy Merckx have the most Giro victories, each of them having won the competition five times. Coppi is the youngest winner of the Giro; he was 20 years, 158 days old when he won the 1940 Giro d'Italia. The oldest winner of the Giro is Fiorenzo Magni, who was 34 years old, 180 days when he won the 1955 Giro d'Italia. The fastest victory in the Giro was in 1983, when Giuseppe Saronni won at an average speed of . Italian cyclists have won the most Giros; 41 cyclists have won 68 Giros between them. Belgian cyclists are second with seven victories, and French riders are third with six wins. The current champion is Primož Roglič of , who won the 2023 Giro d'Italia.\nHistory.\nIn 1909 the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" established the Giro d'Italia, inspired by the success of the Tour de France, which started in 1903. The first Giro was won by Luigi Ganna, while Carlo Galetti won the two following Giros. In 1912, there was no individual classification, instead, there was only a team classification, which was won by Team Atala. The 1912 Giro is the only time the competition has not had an individual classification. From 1914 onwards the scoring format was changed from a points-based system to a time-based system, in which the cyclist who had the lowest aggregate time at the end of the race would win. The Giro was suspended for four years from 1915 to 1918, due to the First World War. Costante Girardengo was the winner of the first Giro after the war in 1919.\nThe dominant figure in the 1920s was Alfredo Binda, who won his first Giro in 1925 and followed this up with another victory in 1927, in which he won 12 of the 15 stages. Victory in 1929 came courtesy of eight successive stage wins. At the height of his dominance, Binda was called to the head office of \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" in 1930; the newspaper accused him of ruining the race and offered him 22,000 lira to be less dominant, which he refused. Binda won five Giros before he was usurped as the dominant cyclist by Gino Bartali. Nicknamed the \"Iron Man of Tuscany\" for his endurance, Bartali won two Giros during the 1930s, in 1936 and 1937. Bartali's dominance was challenged in 1940, the last Giro before the Second World War, when he was defeated by his 20-year-old teammate Fausto Coppi.\nThe rivalry between Bartali and Coppi intensified after the war. Bartali won his last Giro in 1946, with Coppi winning his second the following year. Coppi won a further three Giros and in 1952 he became the first cyclist to win the Tour de France and Giro in the same year. Swiss Hugo Koblet became the first non-Italian to win the race in 1950. No one dominated the tour during the 1950s, Coppi, Charly Gaul and Fiorenzo Magni each won two Giros during the decade. The 1960s were similar, five-time Tour de France winner Jacques Anquetil won in 1960, and 1964, while Franco Balmamion won successive Giros in 1962 and 1963.\nBelgian Eddy Merckx was the dominant figure during the 1970s. His first victory came in 1968; another triumph in 1970 was followed by three successive victories from 1972 to 1974, which is the record for the most successive victories in the Giro. Felice Gimondi was victorious in 1976 winning his third Giro. Belgians Michel Pollentier and Johan De Muynck won the two subsequent Giros in 1977 and 1978. In 1980, Frenchman Bernard Hinault who up to this point had won two Tours de France, became France's first winner since Anquetil in 1964. He would win another two Giros in 1982 and 1985.\nStephen Roche was victorious in 1987, a year in which he also won the Tour and the UCI Road World Championship. American Andrew Hampsten became the first non-European winner the following year, and Laurent Fignon was victorious in 1989. Spaniard Miguel Indurain, winner of five Tours, won successive Giros in 1991 and 1992. Three-time winner of the Vuelta a España, Tony Rominger was victorious in 1995, defeating the previous winner Evgeni Berzin. Marco Pantani was the winner in 1998, a year in which he completed the Tour and Giro double, Ivan Gotti won the previous Giro in 1997 and the subsequent one in 1999.\nStefano Garzelli won the Giro in 2000. Gilberto Simoni was the winner in 2001 and 2003, with Paolo Savoldelli victorious in 2002. Simoni was denied a third victory in 2004, when he was beaten by teammate Damiano Cunego. Salvodelli won his second Giro in 2005, beating Simoni by 28 seconds. Ivan Basso was the victor in 2006, Danilo di Luca won in 2007, though the tour was marred by doping allegations. Spaniard Alberto Contador of was the winner in 2008; the following year he raced in the Tour de France instead, and Denis Menchov was the Giro victor. Basso returned after a doping suspension to regain his title in 2010. Contador was the victor at the podium ceremony in Milan, but he was later stripped of the title after he was found guilty of doping in the 2010 Tour de France. Runner-up Michele Scarponi was awarded the victory.\nRyder Hesjedal became the first Canadian to win the Giro in 2012, beating Joaquim Rodríguez by 16 seconds. After gaining the lead after the eighth stage, Vincenzo Nibali won two more stages to help consolidate his lead and win the 2013 edition. Colombian Nairo Quintana became the first rider from South America to win the Giro in 2014. The following year Contador won the Giro for the second time. Nibali won his second Giro in 2016; he finished 52 seconds ahead of second-placed Esteban Chaves. In 2017, Tom Dumoulin became the first Dutchman to win the Giro, finishing only 31 seconds ahead of Quintana. A year later, Chris Froome won the 2018 Giro, becoming the first British rider to win the race. He finished 46 seconds ahead of defending champion Dumoulin, mounting a comeback in the final week which included an solo victory on stage 19. Richard Carapaz became the first Ecuadorian to win a Grand Tour when he won in 2019. British rider, Tao Geoghegan Hart, was the winner of the 2020 Giro. He won the race by 39 seconds after entering the final stage of the race, a time trial, level with runner-up, Jai Hindley. Egan Bernal won the 2021 Giro, while Hindley won the race a year later to become the first Australian rider to win the Giro. Primož Roglič became the first Slovenian to win the Giro in 2023 when he beat Geraint Thomas by 14 seconds.\nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\nAs of 2022, 22 cyclists have won the Giro d'Italia more than once.\nWins per country.\nRiders from sixteen countries have won the Giro d'Italia.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

The qualification and final rounds took place on July 18, 20, and 23rd at the Montreal Forum. There were 90 competitors from 20 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Zoltán Magyar of Hungary, the nation's first victory in the pommel horse since 1932 (and second overall). Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan was the fifth man to win multiple medals in the event, adding a silver to his 1972 bronze. Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union and Michael Nikolay of East Germany tied for third, each receiving bronze medals; this was East Germany's first medal in the event while the Soviet Union stretched its podium streak to seven Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Two of the six finalists from 1972 returned: silver medalist Sawao Kato and bronze medalist Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan. Zoltán Magyar of Hungary was the reigning world champion and the favorite in the event, with Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union runner-up and Kenmotsu third in 1974.\nIsrael made its debut in the men's pommel horse. The United States made its 13th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals, except that nations were limited to two finalists each; others were ranked 7th through 90th. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nNinety gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 18 and 20.

        "text": "The men's parallel bars competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 18, 20, and 23rd at the Montreal Forum. There were 90 competitors from 20 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Sawao Katō of Japan, the first man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the parallel bars—and, as of the 2016 Games, still the only one to do so (the most decorated parallel bars gymnast, Li Xiaopeng, had his two gold medals separated by a bronze). It was the fourth consecutive victory by a Japanese gymnast in the event, breaking a tie with Switzerland for most all-time. Japan was unable to repeat its 1972 medal sweep, as nations were now limited to two finalists each. Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union took silver, while Mitsuo Tsukahara of Japan earned bronze, missing a 1–2 finish for Japan by .025 points.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the six finalists from 1972 returned: gold medalist Sawao Katō of Japan, bronze medalist Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan, and sixth-place finisher Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union. Kenmotsu had won the 1974 world championship, with Andrianov the runner-up.\nIsrael made its debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its 13th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals, except that nations were limited to two finalists each; others were ranked 7th through 90th. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nNinety gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 18 and 20. The six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 23. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

Tsukuhara and Kenmotsu (bronze in 1968) were the seventh and eighth men to win multiple medals in the horizontal bar.

There were a total number of 26 participating athletes, with three qualifying heats and the final held on Sunday 1983-08-14.\nThe final was a microcosm of these championships. East vs West. The American Mary Decker vs a strong Soviet squad. Decker was so dominant in domestic competition, her races were won from the gun, so she was not well practiced in running elbow to elbow as the Soviets and other Europeans were highly skilled in the art. True to her form, Decker took the lead from the gun, with a large pack surrounding her. As the last lap approached Zamira Zaytseva moved onto Decker's shoulder, immediately to her outside. On the last lap, the pace quickened but Decker refused to let Zaytseva get all the way past. Finally with 200 metres to go, Zaytseva sprinted ahead and gained a couple of steps. Decker looked dejected, unable to keep up all the way through the turn but clearly ahead of Yekaterina Podkopayeva who was battling to stay ahead of Ravilya Agletdinova. On the final straight, Decker moved into lane 2 and started to make a run at Zaytseva, gaining slightly. About 50 metres out, Decker checked over her shoulder to see if any competition was approaching from the rear. Agletdinova-Kotovich was making a run at Podkopayeva several metres back but neither was gaining on Decker. Decker gritted her teeth and noticeably accelerated gaining on Zaytseva. As Decker moved past Zaytseva tried to accelerate. In the effort she started to lose her balance. Two awkward steps of flailing and reminiscent of Yevgeniy Arzhanov a decade earlier, Zaytseva dived for the finish line from four meters out. Clearly beaten by this point, Zaytseva executed a face plant a metre from the finish line and rolled across the line in second. Podkopayeva held off her teammate for bronze. The powerful Soviets all finished in the top four, but Decker was number one.\nRecords.\nExisting records at the start of the event.\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

The Russian duo, Yaroslav Rybakov and world leader Ivan Ukhov, were the most favoured athletes. The 2005 world champion Yuriy Krymarenko and Olympic medallist Kyriakos Ioannou had performed sub-par prior to the competition. Andrey Tereshin, Jaroslav Bába and host representative Raúl Spank rounded out the likely medal candidates. In the qualification round, the two past champions (Thomas and Krymarenko) failed to make the qualifying mark of 2.30 m. All the favourites progressed, with Kyriakos Ioannou topping the rankings, while Mickael Hanany and Motswana Kabelo Kgosiemang jumped season's best to make the final.\nThe final, held on 21 August, was delayed by 90 minutes due to heavy rainfall in Berlin, and this produced much lower results compared to the qualification for a majority of the jumpers. No medalling athlete reached the qualifying mark of 2.30 m that they had two days previously. Ivan Ukhov, who had a season's best of 2.40 m, finished with a best of 2.23 m, and Andra Manson similarly failed to match expectations. Only Rybakov, Ioannou, Spank and Sylwester Bednarek passed the 2.28 m height. Rybakov and Ioannou passed 2.32 m on their first attempts, while the other two athletes took two jumps for the height which were personal bests. These turned out to be the final passes of the competition and Rybakov beat Ioannou to the gold by having one less failed attempt in the competition, while Spank and Bednarek shared the bronze honours.\nThis was Rybakov's first gold after three silvers in past world championships. Ioannou was Cyprus' only medallist from the championships that year. Joint-third Bednarek was a surprise medallist given that this was his first senior outdoor competition and he had started the season with a best of 2.26 m. The winning result of 2.32 m was the lowest winning result in the history of high jumping finals in the World Championships in Athletics, shared with the finals of 1983 and 2005.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 2.30 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final.\nKey: Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nFinal.\nKey: PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best"

        "text": "John Alexander (July 4, 1896 – August 5, 1986) was a professional football player with the Massillon Tigers of the Ohio League and the independent Gilberton Cadamounts, Coaldale Big Green, Melrose Athletic Club and Millville Big Blue. He also played in the National Football League for the Milwaukee Badgers and New York Giants. He is best known for becoming the first person to have played outside linebacker.\nMilitary service.\nAfter graduating from South Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, Alexander worked in his father's jewelry business before enlisting in the United States Army. During his time in the Army, Alexander served under General John Pershing, who was attempting to end Pancho Villa's raids along the US-Mexican border in 1916. Shortly after being discharged, Alexander found himself again in the Army again as an officer fighting in the First World War.\nRutgers.\nAfter the war, Alexander enrolled at Rutgers University. While enrolled at Rutgers, he played football under head coach George Sanford and his assistant coach Paul Robeson, who was an All-American end while at Rutgers in 1917 and 1918. According to Alexander it was Robeson's suggestion that led to him experimenting with a new style of defense, which eventually became the outside linebacker position.\nPro football.\nAlexander and Robeson travelled to Massillon, Ohio in 1919. There they joined the Massillon Tigers of the \"Ohio League\" and would play football for money on Sundays. While with the Tigers Alexander played alongside the likes of Gus Dorais, Bob Higgins, Lou Little, Jock Sutherland, Tiny Thornhill, Greasy Neale and Knute Rockne. In 1919, the Tigers came in second in the \"Ohio League\".\nWhen the National Football League was formed in 1920, Alexander did not join the league. He instead played for several independent teams such as the Gilberton Cadamounts, Coaldale Big Green, Melrose Athletic Club and Millville Big Blue. However, in 1922, he joined the NFL and played for the Milwaukee Badgers. On October 1, 1922, Alexander made football history while playing for the Badgers against the Chicago Cardinals. In that NFL game, he became the first person to ever play the outside linebacker position. While nobody though much of change in position at the time a reporter for the \"Milwaukee Sentinel\" reported on the new position but didn't refer to it as the outside linebacker. The name would come later.\nAfter his stint with the Badgers, Alexander played on several teams located in the New York Metropolitan area. However, in 1926 he played for the New York Giants. Although he liked playing for them, John did not return for the 1927 season because, he was told that he had to take a cut in pay from $100 a game to $75. He played for several Metropolitan teams until 1930, when he was forced to retire due to tuberculosis."

        "text": "The men's 110 metres hurdles at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium 19 and 20 August.\nJust as he had done at the 2008 Olympic final, former world record holder Liu Xiang missed the competition through injury, leaving the reigning Olympic champion and world record holder Dayron Robles as the favourite. Furthermore, two of the fastest hurdlers of the season, David Oliver and Dexter Faulk, had not been selected for the American team, which featured David Payne, Terrence Trammell, and Aries Merritt as the main challengers to Robles. Twenty-one-year-old Ryan Brathwaite was a much improved hurdler that season, and Dwight Thomas and Maurice Wignall of Jamaica were other contenders.\nThe heats stage was one of the more eventful of the championships: Robles struggled to qualify in third as he was hampered by an injury, Merritt did not progress from his race (having earlier suffered a twisted ankle), and Andy Turner (another carrying an injury) was also eliminated. Dániel Kiss was the fastest of the round, setting a Hungarian record. Brathwaite was the only pre-race favourite to win in the heats, while Alexander John and Ji Wei were the other fastest hurdlers. In the semi-finals, Trammell and Petr Svoboda were the top two in the first semi-final, and Payne and Brathwaite (who set a national record), took the second race. William Sharman set a personal best to win the third semi-final, which saw Robles pull up due to injury and Kiss eliminated.\nIn the final, Brathwaite started poorly but was soon level with Payne and Trammell. The three remained even after the final hurdle and, with one hundredth of a second between them, it was a photo finish. Brathwaite emerged as the winner with a national record of 13.14 seconds, Trammell was the silver medallist, and Payne took the bronze. Sharman took fourth with a personal best of 13.30 seconds and Wignall finished fifth, clocking 13.31 seconds, his best of the year.\nAlthough he had entered the competition as an outside medal possibility, Brathwaite became the youngest ever champion in the event, and was also Barbados' first ever gold medallist in athletics at either the World Championships or the Olympic Games. Unable to capitalise on the absence of Xiang and Robles, perennial minor medallists Payne and Trammell again missed out on the gold medal. After Brathwaite, fourth-placed William Sharman was the other surprise of the race: he was a last minute addition to the British team, and his two personal best performances turned him from a rank outsider to Europe's fastest at the competition.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 6 fastest (q) advance to the semi-finals.\nKey: Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nSemi-finals.\nQualification: First 2 in each semi-final (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final."

There were a total number of 35 participating athletes, with five qualifying heats and the final held on Wednesday 10 August 1983.\nJarmila Kratochvílová in lane 3 spent much of the race chasing Mariya Kulchunova-Pinigina to her outside, while Taťána Kocembová quickly made up the stagger on Rosalyn Bryant between the two Czech teammates. Kratochvílová finally made up the stagger on Pinigina in the middle of the final turn and came onto the home stretch barely two metres up on the Soviet and a metre up on her teammate. She widened that to four metres by the finish and Kocembová opened up a similar gap on Pinigina.\nEach of the top four competitors in this race set their lifetime best, Kratochvílová only being beaten once with 1985's still standing world record 47.60 by Marita Koch.

        "text": "Thomas Benjamin Savage (born April 26, 1990) is a former American football quarterback. He played college football at Rutgers, Arizona, and Pittsburgh and was selected by the Houston Texans in the fourth round of the 2014 NFL draft.\nSavage spent the first four seasons of his career with the Texans; during his first three seasons, he was primarily a backup, and notably missed the entire 2015 season due to injury. In 2017, he started the most games of his career at 7. After an offseason stint with the New Orleans Saints in 2018, he spent parts of the 2018 regular season with the San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals without seeing any game action. He then had an offseason stint with the Detroit Lions in 2019.\nEarly years.\nSavage was born in Springfield, Pennsylvania on April 26, 1990, to Linda and Tom Savage. His older brother, Bryan, played quarterback at Wisconsin and Hofstra.\nAt Cardinal O'Hara High School, Savage was a member of the Lions football team for four years and started at quarterback for three. He threw for 1,355 yards and 10 touchdowns as a senior.\nCollege career.\nSavage enrolled at Rutgers University in 2009 under head coach Greg Schiano. After Rutgers opened the season with a 45–17 loss to Cincinnati, Savage was named the starting quarterback. He led the team to a 9–4 record. During his freshman year at Rutgers, Savage passed for 2,211 yards and 14 touchdowns, while throwing only seven interceptions. In arguably his best game of the year, he completed 14-of-27 passes for a season-high 294 yards and two touchdowns against the University of Central Florida in a 45–24 victory in the 2009 St. Petersburg Bowl. He was named on the All-American Freshman Team by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA).\nIn the 2010 season, Savage threw for 521 passing yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. Early in the season, he was sidelined by a hand injury and replaced with freshman quarterback Chas Dodd. Dodd remained the starting quarterback based on his performance against Connecticut in his first ever start. On January 8, 2011, Savage announced he would transfer from Rutgers University. Rutgers granted Savage a conditional release. In February 2011, he announced that he was transferring to Arizona. Savage missed the 2011 season due to NCAA transfer rules, but was eligible to play in 2012.\nLate in 2011, Savage announced his departure from Arizona, a move which followed the announcement that Arizona had hired Rich Rodriguez as head coach. Savage later transferred to Pittsburgh, where he redshirted in 2012. Savage initially wanted to play at Rutgers again; however, a hardship waiver was denied by the NCAA.\nOn August 14, 2013, Pitt head coach Paul Chryst officially named Savage the starting quarterback for the 2013 season opener against Florida State. On September 21 against Duke, he threw for 424 yards and six touchdowns in the 58–55 victory. Savage finished the season with 2,958 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, and nine interceptions.\nSavage majored in communications.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Texans.\n2014 season.\nIn the fourth round of the 2014 NFL draft, Savage was selected 135th overall by the Houston Texans. He was the seventh quarterback to be selected that year.\nOn May 15, 2014, Savage signed a four-year contract with the Texans.\nDuring a Week 13 45–21 victory over the Tennessee Titans, Savage made his NFL debut and had two kneel-down plays. Two weeks later, he had his first significant playing time after Ryan Fitzpatrick broke his leg against the Indianapolis Colts. Savage finished the 17–10 loss completing 10 of 19 pass attempts for 127 yards and an interception.\n2015 season.\nOn September 5, 2015, Savage was placed on injured reserve by the Texans with a shoulder injury. Due to his injury, Savage saw no playing time in 2015.\n2016 season.\nOn December 18, 2016, Savage entered the Week 15 matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the second quarter after starter Brock Osweiler was benched after throwing for 48 yards and back-to-back first-half interceptions. Savage brought the Texans back from a 13–0 deficit and completed 23-of-36 passes for 260 yards as he led the Texans to a narrow 21–20 comeback victory. Savage was named the starter for the Week 16 game against the Cincinnati Bengals. In that game, he completed 18 of 29 passes for 176 yards in the narrow 12–10 victory, clinching the AFC South title for the Texans. During the regular-season finale against Titans, Savage completed five of eight passes for 25 yards before leaving the eventual 24–17 road loss in the second quarter with an apparent concussion, but later returned to the game for one play, which was a kneel down at the end of the half. During halftime, he was re-evaluated for a concussion and ruled out for the rest of the game.\nSavage finished the 2016 season with 461 passing yards and no touchdowns or interceptions in three games and two starts. Due to his injury, Osweiler started in the Wild Card Round against the Oakland Raiders, which the Texans won by a score of 27–14. Shortly after the game, head coach Bill O'Brien announced that Osweiler would remain the team's starter for the Divisional Round against the New England Patriots. Savage then cleared concussion protocol and was Osweiler's backup in the Divisional Round. The Texans lost on the road by a score of 34–16.\n2017 season.\nIn 2017, Savage was competing for the Texans' starting job after the team drafted Deshaun Watson in the first round. After a strong preseason, Savage was named the starter to begin the season. He started in the season-opening 29–7 loss to the Jaguars, but was benched at halftime in favor of Watson. Savage completed 7-of-13 passes for 62 yards, was sacked six times, and fumbled twice, including one that was returned for a touchdown by defensive end Dante Fowler, making the score 19–0 at halftime. Watson then started the next six games for the Texans.\nOn November 2, Watson tore his ACL during practice, prematurely ending his season. This put Savage in line to be the starter. Savage then started in the team's Week 9 20–14 loss to the Colts, completing 19 of 44 passes for 219 yards and his first NFL touchdown, a 34-yard pass to wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in the fourth quarter. Two weeks later against the Arizona Cardinals, Savage had his first two-touchdown game. He finished the 31–21 victory completing 22 of 32 passes for 230 passing yards for the two aforementioned touchdowns and an interception. During a Week 13 24–13 road loss to the Titans, he finished with a career-high 365 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception. In the next game against the San Francisco 49ers, Savage completed six of 12 passes for 63 yards before leaving the eventual 26–16 loss late in the second quarter after suffering a concussion. He was placed on injured reserve on December 23, 2017. During the process, the Texans were suspected to have violated the concussion protocol policy but were not disciplined.\nSavage finished the 2017 season with 1,412 passing yards, five touchdowns, and six interceptions in eight games and seven starts.\nNew Orleans Saints.\nOn March 16, 2018, Savage signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the New Orleans Saints. On September 1, 2018, he was released by the team after Teddy Bridgewater was named the backup quarterback.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nOn October 16, 2018, Savage signed with the San Francisco 49ers. He was released on October 20, but was re-signed two days later. Savage was released on November 1, but was re-signed the next day. He was waived again on November 24, 2018.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn November 26, 2018, Savage was claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Bengals.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn April 9, 2019, Savage signed with the Detroit Lions. He was released on August 31, 2019.\nPersonal life.\nSavage married Catie Varley in 2015."

The award was first given following the 1979–80 season, the first year of the conference's existence (then called ECAC North). Ten players have earned the award multiple times. Only three, however, have been named player of the year three times: Reggie Lewis of Northeastern (1985–1987), Taylor Coppenrath of Vermont (2003–2005), and Jameel Warney of Stony Brook (2014–2016).\nThe award was named in honor of former winner Kevin Roberson of Vermont after he was killed by a drunk driver in his hometown of Buffalo, New York in May 1993.\nVermont has had the most all-time awards with 15. Former members Northeastern, Stony Brook, and Boston University (which respectively left in 2005, 2022, and 2013) are second with five, while four other schools have at least two awards apiece. In terms of individual winners, Vermont and BU are tied for the lead with five each. There has been one co-player of the year award tie (1979–80).

        "text": "The men's single sculls event was part of the rowing programme at the 1924 Summer Olympics. The competition, the sixth appearance of the event, was held from 14 to 17 July 1924 on the river Seine. There were 8 competitors from 8 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat. The event was won by Jack Beresford of Great Britain, the nation's third victory in the event (most among nations at that point). Beresford, who had lost a tightly contested final in 1920 to John B. Kelly Sr., became the first man to win multiple medals in the single sculls though it required him having to compete in the repechage to even secure a place in the final. Great Britain's podium streak in the event extended to four Games; the nation had won a medal each of the five times it appeared, missing only 1904.\nAmerican William Gilmore, who had beaten Beresford in the semifinals, finished second to the British rower in the final to take silver. Like Great Britain, the United States had reached the podium in each of its appearances in the event (this being its third). Josef Schneider of Switzerland earned bronze, the nation's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe only returning sculler from the 1920 Games was silver medalist Jack Beresford of Great Britain. He was the favorite in 1924, having won the 1920 and 1924 Diamond Challenge Sculls and being in the midst of seven consecutive Wingfield Sculls victories. His rival from 1920, gold medalist John B. Kelly Sr., competed only in the double sculls in 1924. The American boat at the Paris Games was instead rowed by William Gilmore, who had been quite successful since a 1919 debut. Gilmore, Canadian Arthur Belyea, and European champion Josef Schneider of Switzerland were significant challengers, though Belyea was hampered by neuritis in his hip.\nAustralia and Poland each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its fifth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1924 competition introduced the repechage, giving losing rowers a second chance at advancement. The tournament featured three rounds: semifinals, a repechage, and a final. There were three semifinals, each with 2 or 3 rowers, with the top finisher in each semifinal advancing directly to the final. The second-place rower in each semifinal competed in the repechage, while the third-place finishers in the semifinals with 3 rowers were eliminated. The repechage consisted of the three men who had finished second in their semifinals; the top sculler advanced to the final. The final featured four rowers. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal 2.\nBelyea finished one length behind Pieterse."

The competition, the third appearance of the event, was held from 14 to 17 July 1924 on the river Seine. Five teams, each from a different nation, competed, for a total of 15 rowers and coxswains. The event was won by Switzerland, with rowers Édouard Candeveau and Alfred Felber and coxswain Émile Lachapelle. The two Swiss rowers had earned bronze in 1920 with a different cox. Defending champion Italian rowers Ercole Olgeni and Giovanni Scatturin took silver, this time with Gino Sopracordevole as their cox. Candeveau, Felber, Olgeni, and Scatturin were the first four men with multiple medals in the event. The United States' debut in the event netted a bronze medal for rowers Leon Butler and Harold Wilson and cox Edward Jennings.\nBackground.\nThis was the third appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nTwo of the four rower pairs from 1920 returned, though both had switched coxswains since the Antwerp Games: gold medalists Ercole Olgeni and Giovanni Scatturin of Italy and bronze medalists Édouard Candeveau and Alfred Felber of Switzerland. The Swiss rowers, with new cox Émile Lachapelle, had won the 1922 and 1923 European championships.\nThe United States made its debut in the event. Belgium and France each made their third appearance, having previously competed in both prior editions in 1900 and 1920.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition featured two rounds (semifinals and a final). There were two semifinals, each with 2 or 3 boats; the top two boats in each advanced to the final. As there were only five boats, the semifinal round eliminated only one team. The four-boat final determined the medals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top two boats in each semifinal advanced to the final, meaning only one team was eliminated."

The competition, the fourth appearance of the event, was held from 13 to 17 July 1924 on the river Seine. There were 10 boats (51 competitors, with Switzerland making one substitution) from 10 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Switzerland, the nation's second consecutive victory in the event; the two Swiss victories matched Germany for most among nations to that point. France earned its first medal in the event since 1900 with silver. The United States reached the podium for the second straight Games with a bronze medal. Hans Walter, a member of the Swiss crew in 1920 as well as this year, was the first man to win two medals in the event, and the only one to win two golds.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nTen teams, each from a different nation, competed. Norway and Czechoslovakia were also nominated but they did not start. Switzerland was the favourite, having won every edition of the European Championships since 1911 except for 1922 when the French team had the upper hand; Switzerland came second that year. The Swiss were the reigning Olympic champions as well. Also returning from the 1920 Games were the silver-medal Americans and the seventh-place Belgians. Hans Walter, of Switzerland, was the only returning individual.\nHungary, Italy, and Poland each made their debut in the event. Belgium and France each made their third appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of competition: semifinals, a repechage, and a final. \nResults.\nThere are contradictory sources regarding the Swiss coxswain. The official Olympic record lists Walter Loosli as having coxed the team in all their three races. Other Olympic results lists show Émile Lachapelle as the Swiss cox. This page reflects how the results are displayed by the Sports Reference database, where Loosli is shown to have competed on the day of the heats and repechage, and replaced by Lachapelle in the final.\nSemifinals.\nFour heats were rowed on 13 July. The top team from each heat would qualify for the final, with the second placed boat going into the repechage. The third placed boats, in the two heats with three boats, were eliminated.\nSemifinal 4.\nIn heat 4, the Dutch team beat the favourites from Switzerland in the two-boat-race. Switzerland, with Loosli as their coxswain, went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on the same day as the heats. The top boat advanced to the final, with the other three eliminated. Hungary finished a metre behind, while Belgium was a length behind.\nFinal.\nThe final was rowed on 17 July. The Dutch team led the race for the first half but then dropped out of the race through exhaustion and did not finish the race. The Swiss team took the gold, followed by France and the United States. The American time is not recorded, but they finished two metres behind."

The event was won by the United States, the nation's second consecutive and fourth overall victory in the event. Canada took silver, its first medal in the men's eight since 1908. Italy, making its debut in the event, took bronze.\nAmong the American rowers was Benjamin Spock, who later became more known for his work in pediatrics and politics.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nGreat Britain and the United States were the dominant nations in the event, with the nations winning all five prior Olympic men's eight competitions between them. The United States held a 3–2 edge and the reigning crown. For the first time, Great Britain's top entry was not the Leander Club; instead, the Thames Rowing Club (winners of the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1923) was the British boat in 1924. The Americans were represented by a crew from Yale University. Other contenders included the 1923 European Rowing Championships winners from Italy.\nCzechoslovakia, Hungary, and Switzerland entered but withdrew before competition.\nArgentina, Australia, Italy, and Spain each made their debut in the event (though Australian rowers had appeared as part of the Australasia team in 1912).

The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nFor the first time since 1900, there were more than 2 boats per heat. The tournament also introduced the repechage, allowing boats that did not win a race to have another opportunity to advance. The 1924 competition featured two main rounds (semifinals and a final) and one repechage.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe top boat in each semifinal advanced to the final, with the second-placed boat (and the third-placed boat, in the semifinal with four boats) going to the repechage.

Sixteen English clubs competed for the Northern Rugby Football League's first division championship, with Hull Kingston Rovers claiming the title by finishing on top of the League.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1978 Kangaroo tour took place during the first half of the season and involved matches between a number of clubs.\nHull Kingston Rovers won their third Championship this season.\nThe Challenge Cup Winners were Widnes who beat Wakefield Trinity 12-3 in the final.\nRugby League Premiership Trophy Winners were Leeds who beat Bradford Northern 24-2 in the final.\nThe BBC2 Floodlit Trophy Winners were Widnes who beat St. Helens 13-7 in the final.\n2nd Division Champions were Hull F.C., with a very unusual perfect season. New Hunslet, York and Blackpool Borough were also promoted to the First Division.\nGeoff 'Sammy' Lloyd of Hull F.C. equalled the club match record for scoring goals when he was successful 14 times in the match against Oldham on 10 September 1978. They were part of a club record 170 goals in a season, and a club record 369 points in a season.\nWidnes beat Workington Town (from Cumbria) 15–13 to win the Lancashire County Cup, and Bradford Northern beat York 18–8 to win the Yorkshire County Cup.\nLeague Tables.\nChampionship.\nFinal Standings\nChallenge Cup.\nWidnes beat Wakefield Trinity 12-3 in the State Express Challenge Cup Final played at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 5 May 1979, in front of a crowd of 94,218.\nThis was Widnes' fifth cup final win in seven Final appearances. To date, this was Wakefield Trinity’s last appearance in a Challenge Cup Final.\nThe Wakefield Trinity , David Topliss, won the Lance Todd Trophy.\nStatistics.\nThe following are the top points scorers in the 1978–79 season.\nMost tries\nMost goals (including drop goals)\nKangaroo Tour.\nThe months of September, October and November also saw the appearance of the Australian team in England on their 1978 Kangaroo Tour. Other than the three test Ashes series against Great Britain (won 2–1 by Australia), The Kangaroos played and won matches against 12 club and county representative sides as well as playing Wales in a non-test international.\nThe 1978 Kangaroos were coached by dual Manly-Warringah NSWRFL premiership coach Frank Stanton who had previously toured as a player in 1963–64. The team was captained by brilliant centre / stand-off Bob Fulton making his second tour after being a part of the 1973 squad.\nThe 11–10 loss to Widnes at Naughton Park on 25 October remains (as of 2017) the last time that the Kangaroos have lost to an English club or county team."

        "text": "Steve Farmer (born 24 March 1965) is an English former professional darts player.\nCareer.\nFarmer's first big run came in the 2006 Winmau World Masters, reaching the semi-finals with wins over Tony Eccles, Michael Rosenauer and John Walton before losing 6–0 in sets to Martin Adams. He then reached the final of the 2007 British Classic, losing to Co Stompé. He was then part of the England team in the 2007 WDF World Cup, reaching the quarter-finals of the Men's Singles event and helping England to victory in the Team Event.\nFarmer qualified for the 2008 BDO World Darts Championship outright but lost in the first round to England team-mate Tony O'Shea. Farmer though was unable to maintain his form from the previous year and was forced to qualify for the 2009 BDO World Darts Championship and lost in the early qualifying rounds. He did though reached the quarter-finals of the 2008 World Masters, qualifying for the last 16 where he beat Gary Robson before losing to Martin Adams.\nIn 2010, Farmer switched to the PDC. On 4 September he reached his first PDC ProTour event final in Crawley, losing to Adrian Lewis 4–6 in the final. Two weeks later, on 19 September, he won his first career title: the Dutch Players Championship by beating Kevin Painter 6–4 in the final. This win meant that Farmer qualified for his first PDC major, the 2010 World Grand Prix. He lost in the first round against Steve Brown by 2 sets to 1. In the 2011 PDC world championship, Farmer came up against a strong player in Paul Nicholson. He lost 0–3 in sets. He reached the semi-finals of the 2011 Players Championship, but lost to an on form Gary Anderson, 7–10.\nHe reached the second round of the PDC World Championship for the first time in 2012. In a tight game against number fourteen seed Ronnie Baxter, Farmer trailed 1–2 in the best-of-five-sets match. He then produced some of his best darts by hitting five 180's in taking six of the final eight legs to seal a 3–2 victory. He continued his run by beating German qualifier Kevin Münch in the second round, but was then whitewashed 0–4 by world number three James Wade in the last 16. In March he hit a nine-dart finish in the third UK Open Qualifier during a first round match against Andy Relf. Farmer was knocked out in the last 16 of the event by Andy Smith. Farmer lost in the preliminary round of the UK Open 1–4 to Jamie Lewis, and reached the last 16 once more in his final ten tournaments of 2012, at the penultimate Players Championship where he was beaten by Gary Anderson 6–1.\nFarmer began 2013 ranked world number 49. He reached the last 16 of the final UK Open qualifier where he lost 6–4 to Matthew Edgar, but the £600 he earned was enough to see him enter the tournament in the preliminary round. Farmer defeated Chris Aubrey 5–3, before being beaten 5–2 by Gareth Cousins in the first round. He played in 10 more events during the rest of the year but couldn't advance beyond the last 64 in any of them. Farmer dropped 61 places on the Order of Merit during the year to start 2014 110th in the world, well outside the top 64 who remain on the tour. He did not enter Q School and has not played in a PDC event since."

        "text": "Speed sailing records are sanctioned, since 1972, by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC). Records are measured either by average speed over a specified distance or by total distance traveled during a specified time interval. The three most sought after records are the: \n500 metre records.\nClass records.\nLast updated: 19 November 2012. \nDay's run.\nA \"Day's run\" is the distance traveled by a vessel in one day, normally measured from noon to noon. This was the traditional measure used in the days of packet and clipper ships and varied in the actual time dependent on whether the vessel was sailing east or west. The records certified by the WSSRC since 1994 are based on a 24-hour distance measure irrespective of longitude.\n24 hour distance record.\nNote that the nineteenth century records are not strictly compatible as they measure a \"Day's run\" which was measured noon to noon regardless of longitude. The two entries above were both eastbound and therefore less than 24 hours.\nNotable performances.\nDuring her Jules Verne Trophy record in 2011-2012, the Banque Populaire V skippered by Loïck Peyron covered 811.70 nautical miles in 24 hours on 3 December 2011 at 11:45 UT, posting 28 days over 600 miles, including 9 days over 700 miles and 1 day over 800 miles.\nDuring her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2009-2010, the trimaran Groupama 3 skippered by Franck Cammas covered 798 nautical miles in 24 hours on 13 February 2010 at 5 p.m. UT, showing 17 days over 600 miles, including 10 days over 700 miles.\nDuring her Jules-Verne trophy record in 2016-2017, the trimaran Idec sport in the hands of Francis Joyon and his crew of Clément Surtel, Alex Pella, Bernard Stamm, Gwénolé Gahinet and Sébastien Audigane, covered 894 nautical miles in 24 hours, and 10 consecutive days at 809 miles / 24 h. Francis Joyon rounds Cape Horn, 16 days after riding off of South America, and after a course of nearly 12,000 miles above an average of 30 knots (730.16 miles / 24 h over 16 days). He then signs a performance increase of between 30 and 40% compared to the record to be broken by Loïck Peyron 5 years earlier. Leaving the southern seas with a lead of 4 j 06 h 35 min over Loïck Peyron's previous record, Francis Joyon, Clément Surtel, Alex Pella, Bernard Stamm, Gwénolé Gahinet and Sébastien Audigane regained the equivalent of 2,800 miles on the record during this episode.\nDuring the aborted attempt of 2019, Yann Guichard sets a new record crossing the equator in 4 days 19 h 57 min and, thanks to favorable weather conditions, lines up 4,812.1 miles from the 11th to 16th day, or 802 miles / day for 6 consecutive days.\n24 hour distance record for Armel Le Cléac'h on Banque Populaire VII: 682,85 miles in 24 hours singlehanded on 2014 January 26th (28,45 knots).\nDuring his record around the world Singlehanded in 2017, 24 hour distance record for François Gabart on Macif: 850,68 miles in 24h.\nDuring his attempt for the Jules Verne Trophy, December 5th of 2020, Thomas Coville on Sodebo Ultim 3 covered 889.9 miles in 24 hours (37.1 knots average).\nDuring the return trip after his victory in the 2021 Transat Jacques-Vabre, Charles Caudrelier broke two unofficial records on the Maxi Edmond de Rothschild: in false solo training, he reached 50.7 knots, and covered 880 miles in 24 hours at an average speed of 36.6 knots. This last record cannot be approved for a lack of adequate equipment on board.\nInstantaneous speed record.\nThe idea of an instantaneous speed record is not officially sanctioned by the WSSRC and is, therefore, not officially measured or documented. The highest speed ever reported is from the crew of Vestas Sailrocket 2 : on 24 November 2012 they recorded a top speed of 68.33 knots in a 25–29-knot wind.\nPreviously, the highest speed ever reported was from the crew of l'Hydroptère. During an attempt on 21 December 2008 at Port-Saint-Louis-du-Rhône, they recorded a top speed of approximately 61 knots (speed not verified or registered on any onboard instrumentation) during a 45 knot gust of wind. This heavy gust of wind overpowered the sailboat, causing it to capsize at high speed. The crew sustained only minor injuries.\n\"Sovereign of the Seas\", 1852, 258 ft, the fastest and longest ship yet built when she was launched in New York, designed and built by Donald Mackay, America's foremost clipper designer. On her maiden voyage, she sailed New York to San Francisco in 103 days. This ship achieved the fastest ever recorded speed of a sailing vessel (22 knots)."

All first-round and quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues with the 'Frozen Four' games being played at the Olympic Center in Lake Placid, New York.\nFor the first time the NCAA tournament was expanded to 12 teams (four more than the previous seven years) partially as a result of an increasing number of programs as well as two additional conferences being created in the interim.\nThis was the first tournament to include an independent school since 1960, more than a year before the ECAC was founded.\nThe championship game is remembered for a missed infraction towards the end of regulation that should have given St. Lawrence a penalty shot but resulted in no call from the official.\nQualifying teams.\nThe NCAA permitted 12 teams to qualify for the tournament and divided its qualifiers into two regions (East and West). Each of the tournament champions from the four Division I conferences (CCHA, ECAC, Hockey East and WCHA) received automatic invitations into the tournament with At-large bids making up the remaining 8 teams. The NCAA permitted one Independent team to participate in the tournament and placed it in the western bracket with the intention to place an additional independent in the eastern regional in 1989. As a result, the two western conferences (WCHA and CCHA) would split only three open spots as opposed to the East's four open spots.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured four rounds of play. The three odd-number ranked teams from one region were placed into a bracket with the three even-number ranked teams of the other region. The teams were then seeded according to their ranking with the top two teams in each bracket receiving byes into the quarterfinals. In the first round the third and sixth seeds and the fourth and fifth seeds played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the Quarterfinals with the winners of the 4 vs. 5 series playing the first seed and the winner of the 3 vs. 6 series playing the second seed. In the Quarterfinals the matches were two-game aggregates once more with the victors advancing to the National Semifinals.

Each won a silver and a bronze.\nIn his seventh Commonwealth Games appearance bowls player Rob Weale won his second gold medal, his first having been 24 years earlier in 1986.\nThe medals won in Delhi raised Wales' all-time medal tally at the Commonwealth Games to 235 (52 gold, 76 silver, 107 bronze).\nAquatics.\nSwimming.\nTeam Wales consists of 16 swimmers.\nArchery.\nTeam Wales consists of 6 archers.\nBest performance – Quarter-finalsTapani Kalmaru (Men's Compound Individual)Janette Howells (Women's Compound Individual)Women's Team Compound\nAthletics.\nTeam Wales consists of 21 athletes.\nBadminton.\nTeam Wales consists of 7 badminton players.\nTeam Wales:\nMen: Matthew Hughes, Jonathan Morgan, James Phillips, James Van Hooijdonck\nWomen: Caroline Harvey, Sarah Thomas, Carissa Turner\nBoxing.\nTeam Wales consists of 9 boxers.\nCycling.\nTeam Wales consists of 17 cyclists.\nTeam Wales:\nMen: Yanto Barker, Paul Esposti, Jon Mould, Lewis Oliva, Rob Partridge, Sam Harrison, Luke Rowe, Geraint Thomas, Rhys Lloyd\nWomen: Jessica Allen, Angharad Mason, Kara Chesworth, Lily Matthews, Nicole Cooke, Alex Greenfield, Hannah Rich, Becky James\nGymnastics.\nTeam Wales consists of 6 gymnasts\nArtistic.\nAlex Rothe, Grant Gardiner, Matthew Hennessey, Robert Hunter, Clinton Purnell\nRhythmic.\nFrancesca Jones\nHockey.\nTeam Wales consists of 16 hockey players.\nWales' Men did not qualify for the 2010 Commonwealth Games\nSarah Thomas\nAlys Brooks\nNatalie Blyth\nDawn Mitchell\nKatrin Budd\nEmma Griffiths\nCarys Hopkins\nLouise Pugh-Bevan\nPhilippa Jones\nClaire Lowry\nElen Mumford\nElla Rafferty\nMaggs Rees\nAbigail Welsford\nLeah Wilkinson\nEmma Keen\nLawn Bowls.\nTeam Wales consists of 12 lawn bowls players over 6 events\nRobert Weale\nJason Greenslade\nMartin Selway\nChris Blake\nAndrew Fleming\nMarc Wyatt\nCarol Difford\nAnwen Button\nHannah Smith\nKathy Pearce\nIsabel Jones\nWendy Price\nShooting.\nTeam Wales consists of 19.\nMalcolm Allen,\nRhys Price,\nMike Wixey,\nScott Morgan,\nDavid Phelps,\nJamie Dummer,\nJohn Croydon,\nSteve Pengelly,\nAlan Green,\nRobert Oxford,\nGareth Morris\nJohanne Brekke,\nJennifer Corish,\nSian Corish,\nHelen Warnes,\nCheryl Gizzi,\nJacquelyn Lewis,\nRachel Gravell,\nNicola Wilson\nTable Tennis.\nTeam Wales consists of 8 table tennis.\nRyan Jenkins\nStephen Jenkins\nAdam Robertson\nPatrick Thomas\nCharlotte Carey\nNaomi Owen\nAngharad Phillips\nMegan Phillips\nTennis.\nTeam Wales consists of 2 players in 1 event.\nWeightlifting.\nTeam Wales consists of 6 weightlifters.\nWrestling.\nTeam Wales consists of 7 wrestlers.\nMen: Brett Hawthorn, Damion Arzu, Kiran Manu, Craig Pilling\nWomen: Non Evans, Sarah Connolly, Kate Rennie"

Argentina won the first three matches of the tour but lost the last three. Although Wales did not award caps for the international game they did select a full-strength team and Argentina came close to winning; they led 19–17 as the match went into injury time but were beaten by a late penalty from Phil Bennett. Wales had won the Grand Slam in 1976 and Argentina's performance was considered a shock."

        "text": "John \"Jack\" Anderson Powell (14 September 1882 – 20 March 1941) was a Welsh international rugby union forward who played club rugby for Cardiff and London Welsh. Powell played a single international game for Wales, in 1906, and faced the Original All Blacks as part of the Glamorgan county team in 1905 and the South African team as a member of the Cardiff team in 1907.\nRugby career.\nPowell first came to note as a rugby player while representing Cardiff. It was while with Cardiff that he obtained his one and only international cap, but before his full Wales cap, he played in two games against international opposition at club and county level. Both matches were against the New Zealand in their first over-seas tour of 1905/06. His first encounter with the \"All Blacks\" was on 21 December 1905, as part of the Glamorgan County team. Wales had played and narrowly beaten New Zealand just several days before the Glamorgan match, but several members of the Wales team failed to show, as promised, for the county match. Cardiff responded by providing five players, Powell, Gibbs, Westacott, Williams and Pullen. The first half was fairly evenly matched, with Gibbs and Williams providing much of the Glamorgan threat. After the All Blacks scored a try, Glamorgan almost countered with a Gibbs kick-and-rush move, but the move broke down after Powell was knocked out in a 'lively' ruck. The match ended 9–0 to the tourists, Glamorgan's first loss in five years.\nFive days after playing for Glamorgan, Powell was in the Cardiff side to face New Zealand again. In an extremely tight encounter, Cardiff lost 10–8, with captain Percy Bush gifting the All Blacks a try which they converted.\nThat same season, Powell was selected for his one and only international cap in the final game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship. Played away from home against Ireland, Powell was one of three new caps brought into the Welsh pack to play in the Championship decider. Despite Wales being unbeaten in their last six encounters, the Irish team gave a remarkable performance to take the match 11–6. Powell was dropped from the Wales squad for the next game and never represented his country again.\nPowell continued to turn out for Cardiff and during the 1906/07 season, he again faced international opposition with Cardiff, this time the touring South Africans. The encounter with Cardiff was the South African team's 28th game of the tour, and so far had only lost one game, 6–0 to Scotland. The Springboks had already faced and beaten Wales, Glamorgan, Newport and Llanelli, and the Cardiff game was the last match of the British leg of the tour. In terrible rain-swept conditions, similar to the conditions that lost the South Africa's the game with Scotland, Cardiff scored four tries without reply, winning the game 17–0. Powell played three more seasons with Cardiff, and with a season record of 29 appearances during 1908/09, he saw Cardiff become Welsh Champions.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

The club is affiliated with the Welsh Amateur Rowing Association (WARA) and hosts several annually organised race events.\nLocation.\nMonmouth is the furthest south of the three rowing clubs on the River Wye; the other two being at Hereford and Ross-on-Wye. The boathouse is sited on the western bank of the river. All rowing activities take place upstream of the 17th-century Wye Bridge and during the summer are limited to the stretch of river between Monmouth and Hadnock. During times of higher river levels, typically over the winter months, it is possible to row 9 km upstream to the Symonds Yat rapids.\nMonmouth School boathouse stands on the opposite bank to the town club.\nHistory.\nThe club was thought to have been founded in 1929 prior to the uncovering of documents that indicate a date in mid-1928. Originally, the club leased an existing warehouse to act as a boathouse until the mid-1960s when the current building was erected.\nThe clubhouse, gym and changing rooms attached to the boathouse were extended and renovated in 1995. The new facilities were officially opened by Steve Redgrave.\nCurrently, the Monmouth Rowing Club boathouse also plays host to boats and equipment from Haberdashers' Monmouth School for Girls Rowing Club (founded 1990) and Monmouth Comprehensive School Boat Club (founded 1992).\nRacing at Monmouth.\nTraditionally, Monmouth summer regatta has been held on the Sunday of the Spring Bank Holiday in late May with crews racing side by side over a straight course (seniors) or (veterans and juniors). In recent years a sprint regatta held over has been added to the programme on the Saturday of the same weekend. Whilst multi-lane regattas, held on lakes and purpose built courses, have increased in popularity over recent years, Monmouth regatta still attracts a substantial number of entries (approx 400 boats) on both days, year on year.\nOutside of the regatta season, Monmouth hosts two main Head of the River races: the Autumn Head, at the end of September, and the Winter Head in mid December. These are timed, processional races typically held over , although when conditions allow the course may be lengthened to approximately .\nRecent Successes.\nMonmouth has developed a particularly strong men's veteran squad in recent years, culminating in their winning 4 titles at the National Veteran Rowing Championships of Great Britain in June 2009"

It consisted of three different classes; MX1 and MX2 classes over 15 events beginning on April 4 in Sevlievo, Bulgaria and ending on September 12 in Fermo, Italy, and MX3 over 12 events also beginning on April 4 in Cortelha, Portugal and ending on September 5 in Geneva, Switzerland.\nRed Bull KTM Factory Racing's Antonio Cairoli dominated the MX1 class, taking exactly half of the victories on offer; 15 victories and 23 podiums in total allowed him to claim his second successive championship title by 88 points, scoring points in all bar two races. Clément Desalle took a career-best second-place finish in the standings, riding for the Teka Suzuki team. Desalle took victories at Mantova, Ķegums and Fermo as he finished 35 points clear of the top-placed Yamaha rider in the championship, David Philippaerts of the Yamaha Monster Energy Motocross Team. Philippaerts won just two races during the season – at Saint-Jean-d'Angély and Campo Grande – but finished each of the season's 30 races within the points-awarding placings as he held off Cairoli's team-mate Maximilian Nagl, a four-time race-winner, by four points. The top five was completed by Fermo race-winner Steve Ramon, seven points behind Nagl. Other victories were taken by Honda's Tanel Leok at Bellpuig and Loket, Yamaha's Ken De Dycker who took a double at Teutschenthal and Ben Townley, who made a one-off appearance for Honda at Glen Helen. KTM won the Manufacturers' Championship by 67 points ahead of Suzuki.\nMX2 was also won by a rider from the Red Bull KTM Factory Racing team, as Marvin Musquin repeated the feat of Cairoli in MX1, by defending the season-end red plate for the championship winner. Musquin started the season with consecutive doubles at Sevlievo and Mantova before adding further doubles at Águeda, Glen Helen and Saint-Jean-d'Angély en route to a grand total of 14 victories, 23 podiums and a championship-winning margin of 61 points over runner-up Ken Roczen of the Teka Suzuki team. Roczen took ten victories during the season, eight of which coming during the final eleven races of the season. Third place went to Kawasaki Team CLS rider Steven Frossard, who claimed ten podium places but only had one win to show from it, coming at Uddevalla in Sweden. The top five was rounded out by Yamaha UK's Zach Osborne and JM Racing Team KTM's Joel Roelants, who took several podiums each but failed to win a race. Only two other riders took victories during the season; KTM's Jeffrey Herlings took four but slipped to sixth in the championship after missing the final three events due to a shoulder injury, and Yamaha's Gautier Paulin, who took a sole victory at Lierop during a part-season. KTM won the Manufacturers' Championship by 88 points ahead of Suzuki.\nMX3 was between two riders, who did battle for the title on their respective machinery. Yamaha's Carlos Campano and Husqvarna's Alex Salvini shared 18 of the season's 24 race wins between them, but it was Campana that prevailed for the championship, by 24 points. Campano's advantage over another Husqvarna rider and third place championship finisher Matevz Irt was 150 points; Irt having claimed seven podium finishes without success. The top five was completed by Martin Zerava and Milko Potisek, with Potisek claiming a race win at Schwedt in Germany, during the season. Other victories were taken by riders during one-off appearances; Mickaël Pichon and Julien Bill claimed doubles at their respective home events at Castelnau-de-Lévis and Geneva, while Toni Eriksson took one win at Vantaa. Yamaha won the Manufacturers' Championship by just 15 points over Husqvarna.\n2010 Calendar.\nThe 2010 calendars of the FIM Motocross World Championships promoted by Youthstream were finalised on 29 October 2009. In February 2010, there was some changes in the calendar."

Derbyshire CCC played twenty games in the County Championship in 1921 and won five, to finish twelfth in the table. They also played a match against Dublin University on 16 July 1921, which was a win for Derbyshire by an innings and 133 runs and an additional match against Leicestershire. W T Taylor wrote of Buckston that \"Only those who played under him knew how much the team owed to the skipper for his example, cheerfulness and leadership\". Having achieved his aim, Buckston could not be persuaded to carry on. Instead, he was elected chairman of the Committee.\nBilly Bestwick was fourth in the national first-class bowling averages with 147 wickets for less than 17 runs each. He took 10 for 40 in an innings against Glamorgan at Cardiff and took five or more wickets in an innings in all but two matches. Samuel Cadman was top scorer.\nWith a considerable amount of new blood in 1920, there were no lasting additions to the Derbyshire side in 1921. John Fisher only played in two seasons and George Goodwin in just one season. George Buckley and Herbert Turland made one appearance each for the side, although Turland later played in a match for Nottinghamshire.\nAdditional players who appeared for the club in the Dublin University match were Geoffrey Bell and players called Dilnot and Freeman."

        "text": "The 2013 World Baseball Classic (WBC) was an international professional baseball competition, held from March 2 to 19, 2013. This was the third iteration of the WBC, following the two previous tournaments, held in 2006 and 2009.\nUnlike the two previous WBCs, which consisted of the same sixteen countries, only the twelve countries that won at least one game in the 2009 WBC were guaranteed a berth in the main tournament. The automatic qualifiers were Australia, China, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, South Korea, the United States, and Venezuela. Four qualification brackets were held in late 2012 and respectively won by Canada, Taiwan, Spain, and Brazil, who joined the WBC as the final four teams (the latter two making their Classic debuts).\nAs in the 2006 tournament, the first round had a round-robin format, which led to South Korea being eliminated on a run difference tiebreaker. Venezuela also failed to advance out of a tough group. The fourth-place teams in each group – Brazil, Australia, Spain, and Mexico – had to participate in the qualifying round in order to return for the 2017 tournament.\nThe second round was a modified double-elimination format, as in the 2009 tournament, where the modification was that the final game of each bracket was winner-take-all, even if won by the team emerging from the loser's bracket, although that game only affected seeding as two teams advanced from each bracket. The Netherlands improved on its surprising 2009 run by advancing to the semifinal game, as did two-time defending champion Japan. However, the two-time defending champions Japan were eliminated in the semi-finals game against stunning Puerto Rico. In the final game, the Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico to become the first WBC champion from the Western Hemisphere, as well as the first team to complete the WBC with an undefeated record, and the only one to do so until Japan also finished with a perfect record in the 2023 World Baseball Classic. Robinson Canó was named the Most Valuable Player of the Classic.\nRevenue-sharing dispute.\nThe preparations for the third World Baseball Classic were complicated by a dispute between the Japanese Professional Baseball Players Association (JPBPA), the union for all Nippon Professional Baseball players, and MLB over revenue sharing. JPBPA demanded a larger share of advertising and merchandise sponsorship revenue for the tournament, a large chunk of which came from Japanese companies. MLB resisted the move in part due to the fact that the World Baseball Classic is a joint production of MLB and the MLB Player's Association, meaning that those two organizations bore the cost of the tournament.\nIn July 2012, the JPBPA voted unanimously to boycott the 2013 World Baseball Classic. The move was interpreted by some news outlets as a non-final decision, aimed at raising the pressure on MLB. In September 2012, Japanese players agreed to take part after reaching a compromise with tournament organizers on sharing sponsorship and licensing revenue.\nQualification.\nThe top three teams from each pool of the first round of the 2009 World Baseball Classic automatically qualified. \nFormat.\nIn the first round, each team played the other three teams in its pool once. Teams were ranked by winning percentage in the first round, with the top two teams in each pool advancing to the second round. There, the teams from Pools A and B (in Pool 1) and the teams from Pools C and D (in Pool 2) competed in a double-elimination format.\nThe top two teams in each pool in the second round entered the four-team single-elimination semifinals. The four qualifying teams crossed over for the semifinals, with the winner of each pool playing against the runner-up from the other pool.\nIn the final, the team with the higher winning percentage of games in the tournament were to be the home team. If the teams competing in the final had identical winning percentages in the tournament, then World Baseball Classic, Inc. (WBCI) would conduct a coin flip or draw to determine the home team.\nIn the first round, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nRosters.\nThe deadline for submitting provisional rosters was January 16, but teams had until February 20 to finalize their roster decisions. Many Major League Baseball (MLB) players participated. The United States provisional roster was made up entirely of players from MLB, and champions Dominican Republic provisional roster had only one player not signed to an MLB team in 2013. The Canadian team had 12 players who appeared in MLB in 2012. Japan had none and two prominent Japanese MLB players, Yu Darvish and Ichiro Suzuki, chose not to play. Though five members who competed for the Cuban national team in the 2009 WBC have since defected, the Cuban team was considered strong despite its 2nd-round sacking. Three members of MLB.com's Top 100 prospect participated: Xander Bogaerts, Eddie Rosario, and Jameson Taillon.\nVenues.\nEight stadiums were used during the main tournament:\nPools composition.\nThe top 12 teams that participated in the 2009 World Baseball Classic were invited back for the 2013 tournament. Spain, Canada, Brazil, and Chinese Taipei won their pools of qualification.\nFinal standings.\nOrganizer WBCI has no interest in the final standings and did not compute. So, it was calculated by IBAF for the IBAF Men's Baseball World Rankings.\nIn the final standings, ties were to be broken in the following order of priority:\nAttendance.\n781,438 (avg. 20,037; pct. 59.5%)\nFirst round.\n359,243 (avg. 14,968; pct. 50.2%)\nSecond round.\n325,282 (avg. 27,107; pct. 68.8%)\nChampionship round.\n96,913 (avg. 32,304; pct. 77.1%)\nAdditional rules.\nOnce again there were limits on the number of pitches thrown in a game, though the limits themselves were changed from the previous tournament:\nIf a pitcher reached his limit during an at bat, he was allowed to finish pitching to the batter, but was removed from the game at the end of the at bat.\nA pitcher must:\nFor purposes of the pitcher use limitation rules, both semifinal games were to be deemed to have been played on the day of the latest semifinal game.\nA mercy rule came into effect when one team led by either fifteen runs after five innings, or ten runs after seven innings in the first two rounds.\nInstant replay was also available to umpires during the tournament. As was introduced in Major League Baseball during the 2008 season, replays were only used to adjudicate on home run decisions, to determine whether the ball was fair or foul, over the fence or not, and the impact of fan interference.\nAn alternative version of the IBAF's extra inning rule was also used. If after 12 innings the score was still tied, each half inning thereafter would have started with runners on second and first base. The runners would have been the eighth and ninth hitters due in that inning respectively. For example, if the number five hitter was due to lead off the inning, the number three hitter would have been on second base, and the number four hitter on first base. However, this rule was never actually employed in this year's Classic, as the only extra-inning game in the tournament ended prior to a 13th inning.\nMedia coverage.\nMLB Network has been announced as the English-language broadcaster of the 2013 and 2017 tournaments. ESPN Deportes provided Spanish-language coverage, and ESPN Radio had audio rights.\nSportsnet was the broadcaster in Canada and ESPN America in United Kingdom, Ireland and other parts of Europe."

        "title": "American football at the 1932 Summer Olympics",
        "text": "American football was a demonstration sport at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. On the evening of August 8, 1932, seniors from three Western universities (Cal, Stanford, and USC) were matched against those from the East Coast's \"Big Three\" (Harvard, Yale, and Princeton). In front of 60,000 spectators at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the West team won by a score of 7–6. All-American Gaius \"Gus\" Shaver from USC was the captain of the West team and the game's leading rusher with 145 yards on 16 attempts. The football game at the 1932 Summer Olympics, combined with a similar demonstration game at 1933 World's Fair, led to the College All-Star Game which was an important factor in the growth of professional football in the United States.\nOrigins.\nThe game was originally proposed by organizers as an \"intersectional\" match-up between the defending national champions, University of Southern California, on the West Coast and East Coast stalwarts, Yale University. USC coach/former Yale coach Howard Jones delivered a confidential proposal from the President of the Organizing Committee for the 1932 Summer Olympics, William May Garland, to the President of Yale University, James Rowland Angell, inviting Yale to play in the game. On the heels of the 1929 Carnegie Report which decried various aspects of professionalism within college football, Angell reluctantly turned down the invitation. Although unable to secure a USC/Yale match-up and determined that football be a demonstration sport, the organizers \"settled\" on a game consisting of all-stars who would have graduated by the Olympic games.\nGame summary.\nThe game was scoreless until early in the fourth quarter. When a field goal attempt by the East fell short, Shaver and another player from the West muffed the ball in an attempt to pick it up. According to various reports, Burton Strange from the East either carried the loose ball across the goal line or simply fell on it in the end zone to give his team a 6–0 lead. Eddie Mays' extra point kick was blocked. With three minutes left in the game, Shaver scored over the right tackle to tie the game at 6–6, and Ed Kirwan's conversion put the West in the lead for good.\nParticipants.\nLike the other Olympic athletes, players for both teams lived in the Olympic Village. The starters for the West team consisted of six USC players, star halfback Rudy Rintala and two others from Stanford, and two from California. The starting line-up for the East team was four players from Harvard and seven from Yale. A number of College Football Hall of Famers elected not to play in the game. All-American Albie Booth of Yale as well as Erny Pinckert and All-American Johnny Baker of USC decided not to play when offered paying jobs in Hollywood. Barry Wood of Harvard, another All-American, was also selected to play in the demonstration, however, he reportedly declined in order to concentrate on his studies."

He served mainly as a player development coach, working closely with All-Stars Sophia Young and Danielle Adams. In 2013, he was hired on the full-time staff to serve as an assistant coach.\nIn April 2013, Wade served as an advance scout for UMMC Ekaterinburg during the Euroleague Final Eight that would see them go on to be crowned Champion of Europe. After the 2013 WNBA season, he took on a role to serve as an assistant coach for BLMA (Basket Lattes Montpellier Agglomeration).\nOn March 2, 2017, Wade was announced as the new assistant coach for the WNBA's Minnesota Lynx. One month later he would also be named assistant coach of Russian basketball powerhouse UMMC Ekaterinburg. On October 4, 2017 the Minnesota Lynx won a grueling 5-game series and were crowned WNBA champions for the 4th time in 7 years. This was Wade's first WNBA title. Sylvia Fowles was crowned MVP of the Finals following her regular-season WNBA MVP award. Wade had worked closely with Fowles during the 2017 season. On April 22, 2018 UMMC were crowned Euroleague Champions, and that title was followed quickly by a Russian League Championship on May 2, 2018. That made 3 titles in less than 7 months for Wade.\nIn November 2018, Wade was named head coach and general manager of the Chicago Sky of the WNBA.

In the midst of the season, Wade received a contract extension through 2025.\nOn July 1, 2023, Wade stepped down of his positions as head coach and general manager of the Chicago Sky to take an assistant coach position with the Toronto Raptors. At the time, the Sky held a 7–9 record. Wade's departure in the middle of the season after initiating major roster changes the prior offseason received criticism.\nPersonal life.\nWade has both French and American citizenship, and is also trilingual (English, French, and Spanish). He is married to Edwige Lawson-Wade, an Olympic silver medalist and professional basketball player. They have a son, James \"Jet\" Wade III."

Patrick had many notable achievements in football, track &amp; field, and basketball. Patrick graduated from Lakewood High School (Florida) in 2003, a school known for tremendously talented alumni such as Ernest Givins, Tom Carter (American football), Tim Carter (American football), Louis Murphy, Dante Fowler, Rashod Moulton, Aveion Cason, Cornell Green (offensive tackle), Jonte Green, Rose Richmond, Shaquill Griffin, Shaquem Griffin He was elected to 2003 East/West All Star game, but declined so another player/friend could get exposure. Patrick graduated from high school with 50 college athletic scholarship offers.\nIn addition to athletics, Patrick was very involved in his community. He was a member of Young Life and http://www.atlantahabitat.org. It was through Young Life and personal friendships Patrick sought to teach others about being both a Christian and an outstanding athlete.\nTrack.\nAs a senior, Patrick won state in track &amp; field in the 4 × 100 meters relay, setting a high school record. Patrick also qualified in the 100 meters with a 10.54s time.\nBasketball.\nAs a junior, he was the 6th man on the State Champion Lakewood High School team, with a record of 33–2. Patrick won the 6th man Award, and broke the state record for blocked shots.\nFootball.\nPatrick set seven Lakewood High School records as quarterback, including number of completions, total yards in a season, highest completion percentage, total touchdowns, total yards in a game, highest average yards per game, and tied the record for longest rush (99 yards) on a quarterback sneak. As a senior, he was ranked 12th in the nation as a dual-threat quarterback.\nCollege career.\nPatrick decided to attend Georgia Tech, primarily to be closer to his oldest brother. During his college career, Patrick played four out of five years as quarterback. In 2004, he played backup quarterback to Reggie Ball. During that same year, he also qualified for the indoor 60 metres in track &amp; field. He also went to the ACC Indoor Championship.\nIn 2005, Carter transferred to Louisville, which meant he had to sit out of athletics for the year. Instead of playing, he logged over 1,000+ hours with Habitat for Humanity and made many visits to children's hospitals.\nIn 2006, Carter resumed playing as a wide receiver, and started along with Harry Douglas, Gary Barnidge, Michael Bush, Brian Brohm, Breno Giacomini, Mario Urrutia and Bilial Powell. During this season, Carter averaged 5.9 yards per punt return, caught 5 passes for 68 yards, and 17 punt returns for 117 yards. He was listed as the fastest player on the team consistently posting 4.2s and 4.3s 40 yard dashes. When Brohm became injured, Carter was moved to quarterback. In the Orange Bowl that year, he threw the first touchdown pass (1st in Louisville BCS history) to running back Anthony Allen.\nWhile at Louisville, Carter also set track &amp; field records for 55 metres, 60 metres, and 200 metres dashes. During his senior year, he helped lead his team to win the Big East Track &amp; Field Outdoor Championship.\nNFL career.\nIn 2007, Carter entered the NFL Draft, and was signed as a Baltimore Ravens free agent. In 2008, Carter signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and played on the practice squad for the season. In 2009, Carter signed with the Seattle Seahawks and later traded to the Miami Dolphins where played for two seasons before joining the CFL Toronto Argonauts, retiring in 2012.\nWhile in Baltimore, Patrick Carter was able to learn under the tutelage of Cam Cameron, who also mentored the likes of Jim Harbaugh, Amani Toomer and Heisman Trophy Winner Desmond Howard.\nDuring his tenure with the Dolphins where he played wide receiver, quarterback and defensive back, Carter was taught about preparing game plans with Offensive Coordinator Brian Daboll and worked under the supervision of Ike Hilliard, who was the assistant wide receivers coach at the time. Carter was also able to understand player development and how to expand the passing game based on a player's skills, learning from Karl Dorrell, who spent time as the Dolphins wide receivers coach (2008–2010) and quarterbacks coach (2011).\nIn Toronto, Carter was exposed to different ways of attacking coverages because of the differences in rules between the NFL and CFL such as what can be executed within the timing of the quarterback's play and the capabilities of the offensive line. This experience allows Carter to game plan differently.\nPost NFL career.\nPatrick Carter became the co-owner of Carter's Express, Inc. in 2011. The company contracted for FedEx and operated 20 trucks for home ground delivery. Carter sold the company in 2018 to join his wife, Brittney Carter, as a joint owner of Life's Purpose, serving over 500 youth since its inception in September 2019, with the support of the community and various non-profit organizations.\nCarter also works to help train young athletes, specifically defensive backs and wide receivers, who have dreams to get football scholarships and has a success rate of 100%.

It would be the last game in the \"Triple Play\" series released for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows, but was the first game in the series to be released on the PlayStation 2. The game features Oakland Athletics first baseman Jason Giambi on the cover.\n\"Triple Play Baseball\" was the first and only game in the triple play baseball series not to feature a year on the title. The new game featured a robust \"create a player\" option and Big League Challenge Mode. The players can play a single player game, a full season, playoffs, or Home Run Derby. Team selection and transfers come under player control. On the PS1 version, Jim Hughson and Buck Martinez provide the commentary, while on PS2 version it is Sean McDonough.\nSinger Vitamin C provided motion capture for the video game, which featured her cover of The Waitresses' song \"I Know What Boys Like\".\nReception.\nThe PlayStation version received \"generally favorable reviews\", while the PC and PS2 versions received \"mixed or average reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. Rob Smolka of \"NextGen\" said of the former console version in its June 2001 issue: \"EA Sports dropped the year from the title, but little else has changed for this final version for the original PlayStation.\" Daniel Erickson later said in the magazine's July 2001 issue that the latter console version was \"drop-dead gorgeous and fun at parties, but it'll disappoint sim fans to no end.\" Glenn Rubestein of \"Extended Play\" gave the same console version all five stars and said it was \"the game to own this season. Its graphical prowess and full range of features make it the most complete title on the market. EA Sports' commitment to quality really shines through, offering one of the best baseball games ever seen on any home console system.\"\nAir Hendrix of \"GamePro\" said of the PlayStation version, \"If you've already played \"Triple Play 2001\" to death, that means there's no reason to upgrade unless you're a consummate fan. But if you haven't bought a new PlayStation baseball game in a while, this is the real deal, delivering the fast-paced, action-filled baseball that is \"Triple Play\"s trademark.\" However, he also said, \"The PS2 pennant race is still on, but \"Triple Play\" sure isn't one of the contenders.\""

        "title": "Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Cornell Big Red men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents Cornell University. Cornell competes in the ECAC Hockey conference and plays its home games at Lynah Rink in Ithaca, New York. Six of the eight Ivy League schools sponsor men's hockey and all six teams play in the 12-team ECAC. The Ivy League crowns a champion based on the results of the games played between its members during the ECAC season.\nCornell has won the ECAC Championship a record 13 times and since the formal creation of the Ivy League athletic conference in 1956 has won the Ivy League title a record 26 times (22 outright, four tied), two more than Harvard's 24 (20 outright, four tied).\nThe 1970 Cornell Hockey team, coached by Ned Harkness was the first (and currently only team) in NCAA hockey history to win a national title while being undefeated and untied with a perfect 29–0–0 record.\nThe Big Red's archrival is the Harvard Crimson. The teams meet at least twice each season for installments of the historic Cornell–Harvard hockey rivalry.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nDuring Christmas break of 1894–95, Yale University student Malcolm Greene Chace, later known as the \"father of hockey in the United States,\" invited Alexander Meiklejohn, along with a team of men from Yale, Brown, Harvard, and Columbia to tour Canada with the goal of learning the Canadian game of ice hockey, which differed from the game of ice polo normally played by American college students. Upon their return, the students established hockey clubs at their respective schools. Meiklejohn promoted the game at Cornell, where he was a graduate student.\nEarly years.\nCornell's history with ice hockey begins at the dawn of the 20th century, with the first organized game being played in February 1901 at the Philadelphia Ice Palace. The ice hockey squad played a total of three games over a four-day period, winning each contest. That first weekend Cornell employed G. A. Smith as the team's coach but for the next eight years would go without. That was perhaps just as well as Cornell played four games over a three-year period, with each match being held at the St. Nicholas Rink in New York City, and was then mothballed for two years. The newly rechristened Big Red returned in February 1907, playing a two-game set on campus for the first time. With no indoor or even artificial facility available all home games were played on Beebe Lake. This ended up being a rather poor arrangement since the ice hockey team would have to rely on good weather for their games until the second half of the century.\nIn 1909 Talbot Hunter arrived to be the first full-time head coach for the Big Red and was able to lead the ice hockey team to a perfect 10–0 record in 1910–11 with none of the games played in Ithaca. Talbot would leave after 1912 but after one win in two seasons he returned as joint ice hockey, lacrosse and soccer coach, heading the squads for two years before moving on. 1916 was also the last year for the ice hockey team as it was shut down due to World War I and lack of available facilities. Up to 1916 Cornell had only played 6 games at their 'home' rink and the team wouldn't return to the ice until 1921. When they did their new head coach was former NHA-er Nick Bawlf, who would lead the program until 1947. Cornell would play as much as it was able over the next 27 years, frequently eschewing Beebe Lake when it wasn't cold enough to skate on safely. After 1931 Cornell could manage no more than two home games each season but, despite the inconvenience, the university continued to support the program. Cornell was one of the few teams to continue playing throughout the duration of World War II but after Bawlf died in the summer of 1947 the drive behind keeping the team alive diminished. Cornell would play one more hockey season under Bud Boeringer but after so much difficulty with the weather the program was suspended indefinitely.\nReturn of the program.\nIn March 1957 Cornell opened its first on-campus arena, the Lynah Rink. The following winter Cornell restarted its ice hockey program with a convincing 16–3 win over the Lehigh club team. While the Big Red wouldn't win many more games over the succeeding three seasons head coach Paul Patten slowly rebuilt the program until it was a respectable squad. Cornell was one of 28 schools who were founding members of ECAC Hockey in 1961 and commemorated the occasion by posting their first winning season since returning. The Big Red finished eighth in the conference but weren't ranked highly enough to receive a bid into the 8-team postseason tournament.\nPatten resigned in 1963 and was replaced by former Rensselaer head coach Ned Harkness. That move was a major turning point in the history of the program. Within two seasons Harkness turned the Big Red into a powerhouse, leading them to a 19–7 record, their first of 11 consecutive .700+ records. though they lost their first playoff game to Brown they improved to 22–5 the next year and reached the ECAC championship game. Cornell received the second eastern bid for finishing as the conference runner-up but because of a disagreement between the NCAA and the Ivy League over postseason participation Cornell declined the invitation.\nChampionship years.\nIn November 1966 the Cornell faithful were able to get their first taste of Ken Dryden, a goaltender who had made waves on the freshman team the year before, and were overjoyed when the Big Red got off to an 11–0 start. A big game was held between the nation's top two teams on December 30 when Cornell met Boston University in the championship game of the Boston Arena Christmas Tournament. The two teams fought to a 3–3 tie through regulation and continued to battle on into the night. After two extra periods neither Dryden nor his counterpart had relinquished another goal and the head coaches for both squads agreed to declare the game a draw with both teams claiming the championship. The following weekend senior David Quarrie was in net for Cornell's first defeat of the season but the 3–4 home loss to Yale lit a fire under the Big Red. Cornell would not lose another game at the Lynah Rink until February 1972, setting a record that stands today of 63 consecutive home wins. The Big Red, led by Dryden, Mike Doran, Harry Orr and Doug Ferguson dominated their competition the rest of the year, surrendering only 12 goals in the next 11 games (all victories) finishing the regular season with a 22–1–1 record. The Big Red were not, however, able to claim the ECAC title as Boston University had finished with a 19–0–1 record in conference play. Cornell turned its second-place finish into an 11–2 trouncing of Brown in the quarterfinals followed up by demolishing third-place Boston College 12–2 in the semifinal. The Big Red met BU in the ECAC championship game for their much-awaited rematch but this time no overtime was needed as Cornell took the title 4–3.\nDespite the championship win Boston University received the top eastern seed and were able to play 15–14–1 Michigan State while Cornell was forced to take on the best team in the west, North Dakota. Cornell was able to defeat the powerful but low-scoring Fighting Sioux in a nail-biter, winning 1–0 before meeting Boston University for the third time in the championship game. Cornell got off to a quick start, scoring less than two minutes into the game, and never looked back, taking their first national title by a score of 4–1. Aside from it being the first championship for the Big Red, it was the first crown for any eastern squad since head coach Ned Harkness won his championship with Rensselaer in 1954.\nKen Dryden would continue to post gaudy records for the Big Red for the next two seasons, winning both the ECAC regular season and tournament championships both years, but faltered in the NCAA tournament, finishing third and second, respectively. Dryden left the school with an astonishing 76–4–1 career record, setting a host of new NCAA records including for career wins, save percentage (.939) and goals against average (1.59). While most of his records have since been broken, his career winning percentage of will likely remain untouched.\nWhen Dryden graduated in 1969, leaving Cornell without the best player in program history, the Big Red were expected to take a step back but team captains Dick Bertrand, Dan Lodboa and John Hughes weren't about to let that happen. After an early-season scare against Brown the team ran through the competition, going 24–0 in the regular season, outscoring opponents 156–43. After eviscerating St. Lawrence 8–1 in the quarterfinals Cornell finally got some pushback with a close 6–5 win over Harvard in the semifinals. In the championship game the Big Red faced off against Clarkson for the first time that season with the Golden Knights top goaltender Bruce Bullock being seen as the only thing that could stop the Big Red from continuing their undefeated season. While Bullock did his job the rest of the Clarkson team couldn't and Cornell claimed its fourth consecutive ECAC tournament championship (a record they hold with Boston University).\nIn the NCAA tournament Cornell faced off against Wisconsin for the first time in team history and were stifled by the Badgers, being held to less than three goals for the first time all season. Wisconsin, however, wasn't able to solve the oppressive Big Red defense and Cornell won the game 2–1. In the championship match Cornell was again set against Clarkson and the Golden Knights got an early jump with a goal 20 seconds into the contest. The Big Red built a 2–1 lead before Clarkson tied the game late in the first period then retook the advantage by the midpoint of the second period. Cornell knotted the score just over four minutes later and sent the game into the third tied at 3-all. In the final frame the offensive onslaught from Cornell finally broke down Clarkson and Lodboa scored a natural hat trick with a goal at even strength, on the power-play and shorthanded. The stellar individual performance allowed Cornell to win the game 6–4, claim their second national title, and post the first undefeated and untied championship season in NCAA Division I history.\nContinuing success.\nAfter the undefeated season Ned Harkness left the school to take over the Detroit Red Wings, becoming the first college coach to jump directly into the NHL. His successor was named shortly thereafter as Dick Bertrand. When Bertrand took over he hadn't yet graduated and thus became the first undergraduate to be named as head coach of a program in NCAA history. The Big Red hardly lost a step under their new bench boss, going 22–5 in his first season but Cornell faltered in the conference playoffs and finished in fourth place, missing the NCAA tournament for the first time in five years. The team made up for it the following two seasons by winning back-to-back ECAC crowns and reaching the conference title game both times, winning in 1973. The Big Red reached the championship game in 1972 but this time they were no match for Boston University and each of the 39 shots they fired at silver-medalist Tim Regan was turned aside and they lost the match 0–4. They followed up that disappointment by getting their worst tournament result in program history, finishing fourth in 1973. Cornell would continue to produce stellar results for the remainder of the 1970s, posting .700+ records each season except for 1976 (.638) but the team failed to win another regular season crown in any of those years. In addition they lost every ECAC semifinal game they played and were thus left out of the NCAA tournament.\nSlow decline.\nIn 1980 Cornell finished with the worst record since before Ned Harkness arrived, but squeaked into the postseason as the 8th seed. The Big Red went on to a surprise run through the conference tournament, taking the title over Dartmouth and making the NCAA tournament. Despite a strong showing Cornell lost their game against Northern Michigan and once again finished in 4th place. The following season Cornell won the West Region, taking their only ECAC division title, but, more importantly, reached the ECAC title game. Though the NCAA had expanded the tournament to 8 teams for that season and discarded the assumed bids for conference runners-up, Cornell had a strong enough record to warrant a #3 seed and get a rematch against Northern Michigan. The quarterfinal was set as a two-game total-goal series, and when the Wildcats took the first game 7–3 the Big Red were behind the eight ball. Cornell fought back valiantly, winning the second game 4–3 but it wasn't enough to keep them alive in the tournament.\nThe next season saw Cornell produce a losing record and miss the ECAC playoff for the first time since 1964 soon thereafter Bertrand resigned and turned over head coaching duties to his assistant Lou Reycroft. It took three years before the Big Red returned to the ECAC postseason, doing so the year after 7 teams left to form Hockey East. The year after saw Cornell win 20 games for the first time in seven seasons and win the ECAC title but they were once again bounced in the quarterfinals, losing by 1 goal to Championship-era nemesis Denver. After the team dropped to 9th in the conference the following year and missed the playoffs Reycroft was out and replaced by Brian McCutcheon who had played on the Big Red's 1970 championship team. McCutcheon was able to get Cornell back to a winning record and keep them there for five seasons but could only manage to reach one NCAA tournament and one conference championship game in that time. After that the Big Red declined sharply, tying the team record for most loses in a season (19) in 1993. After two more years of futility McCutcheon was ousted and replaced by another Cornell grad, Mike Schafer.\nReturn to prominence.\nThe Schafer-era began with a bang as Cornell got its first 20-plus-win season in a decade as well as claiming the 1996 ECAC tournament. He followed that up with a second ECAC championship and got Cornell to win its first NCAA tournament round in 25 years. Cornell went through a short lull for the four years after that initial success but won the ECAC regular season title in 2002, their first in 29 years, and the following year posted their most successful season since 1970 by winning the ECAC regular season championship, the conference tournament and reaching their first frozen four since 1980. During that season David LeNeveu broke the 45-year-old NCAA record for lowest single-season goals against average with a 1.20 mark (since broken) as he helped the Big Red post their first 30-win season.\nCornell would continue to produce good results under Schafer for the next several years, winning both conference titles in 2005 with David McKee breaking Ken Dryden's team record for lowest single-season save percentage (.947). The following year the team finished as ECAC tournament runners-up and though they failed to make it out of the regionals they did play in the longest scoreless tie in NCAA history. While Wisconsin outshot, outskated and out-chanced the Big Red all game long McKee kept the Badgers off the board until 5 second remained in the third overtime period, nearly two full games worth of action. After a down year the following season Cornell would finish in the top three in the ECAC championship for five consecutive seasons, winning the title in 2010 but then went into a four-year slump where their highest finish was 4th place in the conference.\nIn 2017 the team notched 20 wins for the first time since 2010 and finished as conference runners-up. They followed that season up with an ECAC regular season title and while they made the NCAA tournament both years they flamed out in the first round both times.\nIn 2019–2020 the team finished 23–2–4 and ranked #1 in the nation in the USCHO.com poll. Cornell had the best record in the ECAC Hockey League play and received the Cleary Cup for the third straight year. The 2020 ECAC and NCAA tournaments were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nAwards and honors.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nNCAA Division I Ice Hockey Scoring Champion\nTournament Most Outstanding Player\nAll-Americans.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nECAC Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Year\nECAC Hockey Rookie of the Year\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Forward\nTim Taylor Award\nECAC Hockey Student-Athlete of the Year\nECAC Hockey Outstanding Defenseman\nECAC Hockey Best Defensive Defenseman\nKen Dryden Award\nECAC Hockey Most Outstanding Player in Tournament\nAll-Conference.\nFirst Team All-ECAC Hockey\nSecond Team All-ECAC Hockey\nThird Team All-ECAC Hockey\nECAC Hockey All-Rookie Team\nRetired numbers.\nCornell hockey began the practice of retiring numbers on February 25, 2010.

Some are professionally produced from sculpturing or from molds, and some are homemade. Ice luges are sometimes offered in ice bars, and have also been used for serving oysters. Ice luges have also been described as a type of drinking game.\nEtymology.\n\"The Routledge Dictionary of Modern American Slang and Unconventional English\" defines Ice luge as \"a block of ice used in a drinking game in which a shot of vodka, tequila, or other alcoholic drink is poured down the ice into the drinker's mouth.\"\nComposition and production.\nAn ice luge can be carved from a block of ice or cast from a mold. Some designs incorporate the use of a tube that exists within an ice sculpture. Companies that create ice sculptures may purvey ice luges, and some ice companies also create and sell custom designs. Ice luges can also be homemade, and molds are available to consumers for doing so.\nUses.\nTypically liquor, such as vodka, is poured into a channel at the top of the luge and dispensed at the bottom of the channel, either into the mouth of a participant or a glass. There is a possibility that vodka may be diluted with water when ice luges are used (along with other beverages). Martinis and champagne are also sometimes chilled and served using ice luges. They're sometimes utilized in ice bars, which are drinking establishments made primarily of ice. Ice luges have also been used for the consumption of oysters."

The award was first given following C-USA's inaugural 1995–96 season. Two players have received the award multiple times: Danny Fortson (1996, 1997) and Steve Logan (2001, 2002). Coincidentally, both players attended the University of Cincinnati. Another Bearcat, Kenyon Martin, won the C-USA Player of the Year award the same season he was selected as the consensus national player of the year (2000).\nCincinnati and Memphis have the most awards, with five each; Memphis has the most individual winners, with all of its awards having been won by different players. However, neither school is currently a member of the conference. Due to C-USA having lost many members in all three of the major conference realignment cycles of the 21st century (2005, early 2010s, and early 2020s), only four of the nine current member schools have had a winner, with only Louisiana Tech and Middle Tennessee having had more than one."

        "text": "Christopher Dalton Johnson (born October 1, 1984) is an American professional baseball coach and former player who is the assistant hitting coach for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). He played in MLB for the Houston Astros, Arizona Diamondbacks, Atlanta Braves, Cleveland Indians, and Miami Marlins.\nAmateur career.\nJohnson was drafted in the 37th round by the Boston Red Sox in the 2003 Major League Baseball Draft, but he opted for college. He attended Stetson University, where he led the Hatters to the 2005 and 2006 Atlantic Sun Tournament Championships. In 2005, he was named the A-Sun Freshman of the Year, and played collegiate summer baseball for the Hyannis Mets of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Johnson was drafted by the Houston Astros in the fourth round of the 2006 Major League Baseball Draft.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Astros.\nJohnson was called up to the majors for the first time on September 7, 2009 and made his major league debut two days later.\nIn the 2010 season, Johnson batted .308 with 105 hits, 22 doubles, 11 home runs, and 52 RBIs in just 341 at bats.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nJohnson was traded to the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 29, 2012, for Bobby Borchering and Marc Krauss. In his first game as a Diamondback, Johnson hit a grand slam. He became the first Diamondback player to hit a grand slam in his first game with the club.\nAfter qualifying as a Super Two, giving him an extra year of arbitration eligibility, Johnson signed a one-year, $2.2875 million deal with the Diamondbacks for the 2013 season.\nAtlanta Braves.\nAfter the 2012 season, the Diamondbacks traded Johnson and Justin Upton to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Martín Prado, Randall Delgado, Nick Ahmed, Zeke Spruill and Brandon Drury. He enjoyed a breakout season, hitting .321, with 12 home runs and 68 RBIs. In the NL batting race, Johnson finished second to Michael Cuddyer.\nJohnson signed a three-year extension worth $23.5 million on May 2, 2014. The deal included a team option worth $10 million. He regressed in 2014, while attempting to hit for more power. Johnson set a career high in strikeouts, and his walk rate fell.\nAfter continuing to decline in 2015, Johnson lost his starting role to Juan Uribe, who the Braves acquired from the Los Angeles Dodgers during the season. Johnson was pushed into a reserve role, often starting only against left handed pitchers. After Freddie Freeman suffered a wrist injury, Johnson occasionally started at first base, but still saw less playing time than in past seasons. Johnson expressed an interest in being traded at the trade deadline, in the hope of getting more playing time with another team. However, it was Uribe who was traded near the deadline. In addition, Freeman returned from the disabled list and Johnson was expected to regain his starting role at third base.\nCleveland Indians.\nOn August 7, 2015, Johnson was traded to the Cleveland Indians in exchange for Nick Swisher, Michael Bourn, and cash considerations. Johnson appeared in 27 games with the Indians, batting .289 with four doubles, one home run, and seven RBIs. \nOn December 22, 2015, the Indians released him.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn January 13, 2016, Johnson signed a one-year contract with the Miami Marlins.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn February 13, 2017, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles, that included an invitation to major league spring training. He was released on March 27 but re-signed a couple of days later. Johnson played in 69 games split between the Triple–A Norfolk Tides and the Low–A Aberdeen IronBirds, hitting .292/.330/.491 with 11 home runs and 37 RBI. He elected free agency following the season on November 6.\nChicago White Sox.\nOn January 24, 2019, Johnson signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox. He was released on March 20, 2019. \nCoaching career.\nChicago White Sox.\nJohnson was hired as the hitting coach for the Charlotte Knights, the Triple-A affiliate of the Chicago White Sox, before the 2021 season.\nOn November 29, 2022, Johnson was named assistant hitting coach for the White Sox. This would be his first coaching position in the Major League level.\nJohnson was named the assistant hitting coach for the Washington Nationals for the 2024 season.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson is the son of former MLB player and coach Ron Johnson."

        "text": "World Snooker Championship 2007 is a sports video game developed by Blade Interactive and published by Sega for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was announced at E3 in 2006, by Sega along with other games, including Sonic Rivals and Virtua Tennis 3. The game would be announced at this time as being a PlayStation exclusive for PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable, and also under the release name for North America, \"World Pool Championship 2007\", to be released in September 2006.\nHowever, the game was later delayed for a PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions to be created. As the game of Snooker is largely not played in the Americas, the game was released featuring Pool, instead of Snooker in the game's title. However, the game had no features cut from the game's American release.\nGameplay.\nPlayers can create their own character and compete against or play as professional snooker players such as: Shaun Murphy, Ronnie O'Sullivan, and John Higgins. For the first time in the series, professional Pool players are included, with players like Efren Reyes and Earl Strickland available to play against in the Pool modes.\nGame modes include snooker, 8-ball, 9-ball and the returning John Virgo's trick shot. This latest edition includes improvements on the visual aids the player can turn on. The player is now able to see where the cue ball will end up after his shot, with a bigger circle of where the ball will end up being decided by how difficult the previous shot was.\nThe game boasted 104 top snooker players and ten official tournaments, all modeled for the 2007 season. In-game commentary is provided by John Parrott, John Virgo and Steve Davis. The game also features a brand new \"Golden Cue\" mode, where games can be made up of frames from different sports, such as a frame of Snooker, followed by a frame of Nine ball pool.\nReception.\n\"World Snooker Championship 2007\" received \"mixed or average\" and \"generally positive\" reviews, according to review aggregator GameRankings. Many of the game's reviewers commented that the game did not have \"next generation\" graphics, with Tom Orry from \"VideoGamer.com\" commenting that the game looked \"pig ugly.\" \"IGN\" commented that the game may have been influenced by its PlayStation Portable release, and caused graphics for the console release to be less impressive to make porting easier.\nRob Burman of \"IGN\" also published a review of the game, for both Xbox and PS3, but stated the Xbox 360 version was superior, stating \"Compared to the Xbox 360 game, this PS3 iteration has borne the brunt of the ugly stick.\" before scoring the game with a 7.2/10. Keza MacDonald of \"Eurogamer\" reviewed the game, but scored the game at 6/10. MacDonald stated that the game was similar to existing titles, and that there were only marginal upgrades to the previous games in the series calling it \"hardly an advancement over its predecessors\". MacDonald also commented \"...it's snooker (and pool, and billiards) by numbers, with none of the realistic-looking players or visual authenticity or visible effort of its golf, table tennis or basketball compatriots on the Xbox 360.\"\nWorld Snooker Championship 2007 reached a series high 6th in the UK game charts, on 20 January 2007. The game's success co-incidence with the Masters competition that year, won by Ronnie O'Sullivan. The game would last two weeks in the top 10, before leaving the charts in February 2007."

        "text": "A backboard is a piece of basketball equipment. It is a raised vertical board with an attached basket consisting of a net suspended from a hoop. It is made of a flat, rigid piece of, often Plexiglas or tempered glass which also has the properties of safety glass when accidentally shattered. It is usually rectangular as used in NBA, NCAA and international basketball. In recreational environments, a backboard may be oval or a fan-shape, particularly in non-professional games.\nThe top of the hoop is above the ground. Regulation backboards are wide by tall. All basketball rims (hoops) are in diameter. The inner rectangle on the backboard is wide by tall, and helps a shooter determine the proper aim and banking for either a layup or distance shot.\nIn addition to those markings and those of its manufacturer, leagues and governing bodies often place other decals on the edge of the backboard on the glass, including the logo of the league or organization, and a national flag. On top of the backboard, a league or team's web address or sponsor logo is affixed to take advantage of the high television camera angle utilized for instant replay of slam dunks and other shots above the rim.\nIn professional and most higher college settings, the backboard is part of a portable wheeled stanchion that can be moved out of the way and stored to allow the venue to host multiple other sports and events, though in most high schools and examples such as Stanford University's Maples Pavilion and Cameron Indoor Stadium at Duke University, backboards are mounted as part of a suspended system using the venue's ceiling joists to support the goal and allow them to be put out of the way in the ceiling support system via a system of pulleys when not in use, along with the more common wall-mounted system. Practice or gym class-utilized sideline backboards are generally of the permanently wall-mounted variety, and usually have opaque fiberglass or thick metal boards instead, along with most outdoor municipal park boards.\nIn intervening years, the portable stanchion containing the backboard has also taken on cabling and sensors within its core, along with the structure of a game clock and shot clock above it, which makes the setup of one as involved as an arena's basketball floor, to the point of requiring a replacement backboard being on standby if it and/or the rim is ever taken out of level or broken.\nThe first glass backboard was used by the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team at the Men's Gymnasium at Indiana University. After the first few games at their new facility in 1917, spectators complained that they could not see the game because of opaque wooden backboards. As a result, the Nurre Mirror Plate Company in Bloomington was employed to create new backboards that contained plate glass so that fans could see games without an obstructed view. It was the first facility in the country to use glass backboards.\nProfessional glass backboards used to break from of force or more. Modern professional and higher-level college play backboards do not have the glass absorbing any weight to avoid breaking the glass and backboard as a whole."

        "text": "Jack Fish (30 December 1878 – 23 October 1940) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1890s, 1900s and 1910s. He played at representative level for England and Lancashire, and at club level for Warrington (Heritage № 65) (captain), as a goal-kicking , i.e. number 2 or 5.\nBiography.\nJack Fish was born in Runcorn, Cheshire in 1878, he played for Lostock Gralam FC where he was soon noticed, and a trial match for Warrington was organised in 1898. Legend has it that as he entered the committee room he was confronted with a table heaped with £50 in silver, and the signing was then a mere formality, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £20,190 in 2017), and he died aged 61 in Warrington, Lancashire, England.\nProfessional playing career.\nFish played in Warrington's friendly at home against Barrow on 15 October 1898 and scored from the half-way. His league début was the following week on 22 October 1898; a 3-2 victory at Rochdale Hornets. He went on to be Warrington's leading try scorer that season' and for the following six seasons, becoming the club's first superstar. Fish was a stockily built man, at only and . He had fantastic acceleration and a tricky swerve, but he could also stop dead in his tracks whilst running at full speed, which left many would-be tacklers whizzing into touch! He once accepted a £100 sprint challenge with a flying called Buckie Green from Wigan, at Springfield Park, Wigan, and won in a canter, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £37,760 in 2017).\nFish played , i.e. number 2, and scored a try, and a goal in Warrington's 10-3 victory over Australia in the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain tour match during the 1908–09 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington, Saturday 14 November 1908, in front of a crowd of 5,000, due to the strikes in the cotton mills, the attendance was badly affected, the loss of earnings meant that some fans could not afford to watch the first tour by the Australian rugby league team, and played and scored a try in the 8-8 draw with Australia in the 1908–09 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain tour match during the 1908–09 season at Wilderspool Stadium, Warrington, Monday 8 February 1909, in front of a crowd of 7,000.\nHe was idolised in the town, and supporters could be seen wearing metal fish badges at games. When it came to cup ties he was put in the care of Heesom, a local professional sprinter, who gave the special preparation. He was prominent in Challenge Cup Finals, scoring twice including one from half way in 1905 as Warrington beat Hull Kingston Rovers 6-0 to win the trophy for the first time.\nHis testimonial match in 1910 raised over £268, (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £93,470 in 2013), before playing his last match at Coventry in a First Round Challenge Cup match, where he scored his last try to help Warrington into the next round in an 18-10 victory. \nFish won caps for England while at Warrington in 1904 and in 1906 against Other Nationalities. He broke his leg in the 1906 match. Fish played again for England in 1908 against Wales.\nFish's last match for Warrington was on 18 February 1911. Altogether he played 321 games for the club, scoring 215 tries and kicking 262 goals for a total of 1,169 points.\nHis representative honours amounted to playing twice for England and 16 times for Lancashire for whom he scored and 16 tries and 12 goals.\nChallenge Cup Final appearances.\nJack Fish played , i.e. number 5, in Warrington's 0–6 defeat by Batley in the 1900–01 Challenge Cup Final during the 1900–01 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, in front of a crowd of 29,563, played in the 3–8 defeat by Halifax in the 1903–04 Challenge Cup Final during the 1903–04 season at The Willows, Salford, in front of a crowd of 17,041, played in the 6–0 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers in the 1904–05 Challenge Cup Final during the 1904–05 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds, in front of a crowd of 19,638, and played was captain, and scored a sensational try hacking on a wayward Oldham pass, dribbling forward and then picking up the bouncing ball to swerve round the Oldham ; / in the 17–3 victory over Oldham in the 1906–07 Challenge Cup Final during the 1906–07 season at Wheater's Field, Broughton, Salford on Saturday 27 April 1907, in front of a crowd of 18,500.\nPost-playing.\nFish is still the only player in Warrington's history to score more than 200 tries and 200 goals."

He had previously spent time dual registered with Bedford Blues and at international level has represented the England Saxons.\nClub career.\nBorn in Watford, Fraser was educated at Berkhamsted School and Dulwich College and joined Saracens in 2005. In 2009 he spent six months with the Western Province Academy in South Africa and the following year signed on dual registration terms with Bedford Blues. He made his Bedford debut as a replacement against Doncaster Knights in September 2010, making a further five appearances over the next two months. After a six-month gap he made his last appearance for the club in the Championship play-off semi final defeat to Worcester Warriors in May 2011.\nHe remained dual registered with Bedford for the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons but did not make any appearances due to his commitments to Saracens, who he made his debut for in September 2011 as a replacement against Bath Rugby. He made a further 15 appearances during the season, including the 22–3 Heineken Cup quarter final defeat to Clermont Auvergne. Having been overpowered by the French side during the game, Fraser was among a number of Saracens players to work on his body composition and added nearly 10 kg to his frame in the following twelve months.\nFraser cemented his place in the side during the 2012–13 season and by January had accumulated more minutes on the pitch than anyone bar captain Steve Borthwick. In the same month he was among 10 players who signed extensions to their contracts with Saracens. He played 19 Premiership games and started all seven of Saracens Heineken Cup matches before tearing a tendon off the bone in his shoulder against Gloucester Rugby in April 2013. The injury ruled him out of Saracens' Premiership and Heineken Cup semi-final defeats, as well the possibility of selection for the England tour of Argentina.\nHe returned to the side in October 2013, six weeks earlier than expected, in a 19–12 win over London Wasps. In December, only six games into his comeback, he suffered another serious injury after being stretchered off against Sale Sharks with a suspected broken foot and damaged knee ligaments.\nIn the 2015–16 season Fraser helped Saracens to both the Premiership title and the European Rugby Champions Cup, and started both finals.\nOn 24 August 2017 Fraser was forced to retire from rugby owing to a neck injury.\nInternational career.\nFraser first represented England in 2006 when he made three appearances for the under-16s including a game against the Italy under-17 A team in which he scored a try. He missed out on further age grade representation but was selected for the England Counties tour to Canada in 2010. He started the opening match against The Rock and scored a try but suffered a knee injury in the last moments of the game and was ruled out of the remainder of the tour.\nIn January 2013 Fraser was named in the England Saxons squad for the first time and made his debut two weeks later in the 14–10 win over the Ireland Wolfhounds, scoring a try. A week later he also started in the defeat to Scotland A and his performances saw him called into the senior England squad as injury cover for the Six Nations games against Ireland and France, though ultimately he was not included in the 23 for either match. He was tipped to travel with the England senior squad for the tour of Argentina before being ruled out through an injury sustained with Saracens."

        "text": "The Little League World Series was held in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. It began on August 20 and ended on August 29. Eight teams from the United States and eight from throughout the world competed in the 64th edition of this tournament. In the championship game, the international champions from Tokyo, Japan, defeated the United States champions out of Waipahu, Hawaii. It was the seventh LLWS championship for Japan overall, and the first since 2003.\nActivision released a video game in advance of the event, \"Little League World Series Baseball 2010\".\nTournament changes.\nOn April 14, 2010, Little League announced that starting in 2010, round robin play would be replaced by a double-elimination bracket in each pool. The winners of each pool will advance to single elimination US and International Championship games and the winners of those games will advance to the World Championship game. Every team will play a minimum of three games: the four teams that lose their first two games will cross over and play special US vs. International games.\nOn August 2, 2010, it was announced that instant replay would be expanded. The system, which was first used in 2008, now includes force outs, tags along the base paths, missed bases, and hit batters as plays that are subject to review. Previously, only plays in which a dead ball would have resulted were able to be reviewed. Additionally, team managers are now allowed to challenge plays if the umpires have not already called for a replay. Before losing the right to challenge, managers are allowed only one unsuccessful challenge in the first six innings of a game, as well as one unsuccessful challenge in extra innings. Challenges must be made after the play in question and before the next pitch. A \"replay team\" located in an office at Howard J. Lamade Stadium will judge all plays under review. The first challenge in LLWS history that resulted in an original ruling being overturned occurred on August 21, the second day of the tournament. Prior to the championship game, instant replay had been used 16 times with 8 calls being overturned while the other 8 were upheld. The average amount of time needed for all reviews was 52 seconds.\nResults.\nCrossover games.\nTeams that lost their first two games played a crossover game against a team from the other side of the bracket that also lost its first two games. These games were labeled Game A and Game B. This provided teams who were already eliminated the opportunity to play a third game.\nChampions path.\nThe Edogawa Minami LL reached the LLWS with a record of 8 wins, 1 loss, and 1 tie. In total, their record was 13–1–1, their only loss coming against Musashi-Fuchu."

        "text": "Ricky Ponting is a retired Australian cricketer and former captain of the Australia national cricket team. He has scored centuries (100 or more runs) on 41 occasions in Test cricket and 30 times in One Day International (ODI) matches, both of which are Australian records. In Test matches, Ponting has scored hundreds against all Test playing countries. He is third (41) in the list of Test century-makers, behind Sachin Tendulkar (51) &amp; Jacques Kallis (45). Ponting's first Test century was achieved against England at Headingley in 1997, when he scored 127. His highest innings is 257, scored against India in late-2003 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Ponting, among 41 centuries, has scored 6 double centuries, while his Test centuries have been made at 21 cricket grounds, including 15 at venues outside Australia. Ponting has been dismissed four times in the nineties, along with 96 on his Test debut. Ponting has scored centuries in both innings of a Test three times, equalling the record set by Sunil Gavaskar. This included a century in each innings of his 100th Test match thus becoming the only player in history to achieve that feat. In that match he also guided Australia to a successful run chase against South Africa on the final day. In 2006, Ponting scored seven centuries, the most by an Australian in a year.\nIn ODIs, Ponting has scored 30 centuries against 11 opponents. He has scored centuries against all cricketing nations that have permanent One Day International status and is the first ever batsman in the world to achieve this feat in ODI cricket history. His first ODI century was against Sri Lanka in the ninth match of the Benson &amp; Hedges World Series, held in the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1996. His highest ODI score is 164, which he scored against South Africa at the Wanderers Stadium, Johannesburg in 2006. This propelled Australia to a new ODI world record score, although this mark lasted only a few hours before South Africa overhauled their target in the last over of the match. Ponting is third in the list of century-makers, behind Tendulkar (49) and Kohli (44). Ponting has scored 12 centuries at home grounds and 16 centuries at away or neutral venues. Seven centuries were hit at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He has been dismissed four times in the 90s. Ponting previously held the highest score in a World Cup final with 140 not out against India in 2003, before it was broken by Adam Gilchrist in 2007. He has scored five World Cup centuries, along with Kumar Sangakkara, both are behind Tendulkar with six. His 145 against Zimbabwe in 1998 equalled Dean Jones' Australian record score, but this was surpassed in early-1999 by Adam Gilchrist's 154.\nIn September 2009, Ponting retired from Twenty20 international (T20I) cricket, failing to score a century in a T20I match. However, in the first International played, he hit 98 not out against New Zealand in Auckland.\nRicky Ponting has scored hundreds at each of the six prominent cricketing venues in Australia in both Tests and ODIs and is the only Australian to do so."

Under such a model, the GM reports directly to the owner or team president. However, some team owners serve as their own GM or employ one who act in a supporting role to the head coach. Al Davis of the Oakland Raiders was an example of an owner who also served as GM, while Bill Belichick is an example of a head coach having de facto GM responsibilities during his tenure with the New England Patriots.\nResponsibilities.\nThe general manager (GM) is typically the head of football operations, which includes leading the scouting department and being responsible for handling free agent transactions and contract negotiations with players and coaches. The scouting department's role is to evaluate college football players entering the annual NFL draft. During the NFL Combine, general managers will interview players. \nMany GMs begin their front office career as an assistant scout and are promoted into roles such as director of college scouting or vice president of player personnel before being GM. The GM is also responsible for negotiating contracts with players and coaches. As with head coaches and some players, GMs are required by the NFL to attend press conferences with the media. During the season, general managers will work 100 hours or more a week. Some Pro Football Hall of Fame general managers include Tex Schramm, Al Davis, Bill Polian, Ron Wolf, Bobby Beathard, Gil Brandt, and George Young."

However, after only a few years it went bankrupt, and CSA Steaua operated only a youth club for basketball, under the name of Clubul Sportiv Școlar Steaua București.\nIn 2008, Steaua merged with BC Târgoviște and played again in the first division, under the name BC Steaua București. Turning on the new page in club's history, with Mladen Jojic as head coach, Steaua decided to compete in Divizia B with young team and mostly Romanian players, with the average age of 21.\nThe team eventually returned to the highest level in Romania. In 2011, the team reached the Romanian Cup Final, which was the first time in a long time that the team played for a trophy.\nIn 2013, the team merged with CSM Bucharest and a new team name was found in CSM Steaua Bucharest.\nIn the 2015–16 season, the newly formed team would make its debut in Europe through the Eurocup.\nFans.\nSteaua Bucuresti sports sections are famous by large fans database. With the biggest crown size in Romania, mostly dedicated to football and basketball club.\nCurrently Steaua's supporters are not led by a single group. The tendency nowadays is to form several small groups who play their own part. The most important part of them are located in the Peluza Nord (North End), some others taking their place in the Peluza Sud (South End). Because of different attitudes towards the team and the game (PS are usually tougher and more severe in which regards the game and often not so patient), there have lately been quite a few conflicts between the two. The groups at the PS (\"Ultras, Glas, Vacarm, Stil Ostil, Banda Ultra, Era, Outlaws, Hunters, South Boys\") even officially ceased activity for a while because of conflicts like these with the more numerous PN. Groups inside \"Peluza Nord\" include \"Tineretului Korp, Titan Boys, Nucleo, Gruppo Tei, Skins Berceni, Insurgenții, Armata 47, Ultras Colentina, Gruppo Voluntari Est, Roosters\".\nIt is rather difficult to assign Steaua fans a certain style. They are described by the typical Italian style, common in different respects to all Romanian groups of fans, with many choreographies, banners, flags, double holders and flags swinging in the air.\nArenas.\nSteaua București plays its home national domestic league games at the 2,000-seat Sala Mihai Viteazul. They play their home European league games at the 5,300 seat Sala Polivalentă."

Apart from football and rugby, the other sports currently practised at the club are field hockey, and tennis.\nAs of 2017, the club had 500 members and 400 athletes competing in several sports.\nHistory.\nA predecessor to MVCC, \"Victoria Cricket Club\" had been founded by British immigrants led by Samuel Lafone in 1842, with the purpose of playing Cricket. Nevertheless, it is believed that the club was dissolved soon after as there were no further records of its activities. The Great Siege of Montevideo in 1843 also interrupted all sports activities in the city.\nThe same group of English people would establish MVCC on 18 July 1861 at \"Confitería Oriental\", where the high society and businessmen of Montevideo used to met. The first playing field was located on a land where Military Hospital stands nowadays. The club is recognised as the oldest sports club of Uruguay, having been the pioneer in the practise of cricket, field hockey, football, rugby union, and tennis. Moreover, MVCC is regarded as the oldest sports club in South America. The coming of further British companies to Montevideo (such as water suppliers, railways, and banks) helped increase the number of members of the MVCC.\nIn 1868, the MVCC played its first international cricket game against Argentine Buenos Aires Cricket Club. It is the oldest international match registered in South America and was played on MVCC's ground known as \"La Blanqueda\". MVCC played its first international rugby match against Argentine side Buenos Aires Football Club (another pioneer club regarded as the first institution to play any form of \"football\" in South America). The match was held in Montevideo.\nThe MVCC played its first football match in 1878, against the crew of a ship visiting Montevideo. This was the first organised match in Uruguay. In 1881, the MVCC played its first club match against the Montevideo Rowing Club. MVCC also took part of the first international match involving an Uruguayan football squad, when faced the \"Buenos Aires Team\" at Montevideo in 1889.\nWhen the Uruguayan Football Association (AUF) was established in 1900, MVCC was one of the clubs invited to join but they refused so they did not want the club to be ruled by a non-British body.\nIn 1983, the MVCC first played the Club Universitario de Buenos Aires (C.U.B.A.), and has played them annually ever since.\nIn 1974 and 1975, the MVCC swimming teams won the summer championships in swimming and diving.\nThe ladies' field hockey team won the local championships in 1987, 1989, 1993 and 1997, and men's team won its first championship in 2000. The club also competes in athletics, cycling, and tennis.\nRugby.\nEnglish cricket clubs were the incubators of rugby in South America, although rugby has survived much better in these countries than cricket has. It has been claimed that MVCC played rugby football as early as 1865, but the first certain match was between Uruguayans and British members of the MVCC in 1880. One observer, apparently disdainful of the Britons mixing with the \"natives\", found it:\nCarlos E. Cat, also known as \"Charlie\", was a member of the MVCC, and was also president of the club in 1946.\nIn 1950, the Campeonato Uruguayo de Rugby was inaugurated and continues today. The first game was between the MVCC, and Carrasco Polo Club.\nMVCC had some success in the 1950s, winning the national title three times. In recent years however, the club has had to live in the shadows of Montevideo's two powerhouses: Carrasco Polo Club and Old Christians Club.\nGrounds.\nSince its establishment in 1861, MVCC has have five different grounds. Its original ground was known as \"La Blanqueada\" or the \"English ground\", but in 1889, it moved from its original location to make way for a military hospital to a new site nearby. This was also known as \"La Blanqueada\" or the \"New Ground\" to distinguish it from the original site. The new site was purchased by debentures that members bought.\nThe MVCC moved a third time in 1945 to near the town of Sayago. It moved for a fourth time to Carrasco, in 1955, where fields were shared by The British Schools of Montevideo.\nIn 1996, the MVCC moved yet again to Solymar on the outskirts of Montevideo.\nOrigins of CURCC.\nThe Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (CURCC), predecessor to club Peñarol, was established in 1891 by members of MVCC in disagreement with the club's rules that did not allowed native Uruguayans to be members of MVCC. Apart from that reason, the foundation of a new club reflected the need of those English immigrants to have another institution that competed in cricket.\nBritish newspapers of South America celebrated the creation of CURCC, stating that \"The MVVC have long felt the lack of a local rival club against which to measure their strength.\" The sixteen founders of CURCC were hierarchical employees of the Central Uruguay Railway, the main railway company in the country."

        "title": "Gymnastics at the 1980 Summer Olympics – Men's artistic individual all-around",
        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 20, 22 and 24th at the Sports Palace of the Central Lenin Stadium. There were 65 competitors from 14 nations. Each nation could enter a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Alexander Dityatin of the Soviet Union, the nation's second consecutive and fifth overall victory in the event (taking the lead for most among nations at the time). It was the second of Dityatin's 8 total medals in 1980, a record that still stands through the 2016 Games (though it has been tied twice by Michael Phelps, including his 2008 performance of 8 \"gold\" medals). Dityatin's teammate, defending gold medalist Nikolai Andrianov, finished with the silver medal. Andrianov was the 10th man to win multiple medals in the event; he would also finish the 1980 Games with a total of 15 medals over all years—most among men at the time (though behind Larisa Latynina's 18; Phelps would later shatter both those totals with 28). Bronze went to Stoyan Deltchev of Bulgaria—the first medal in the event by a gymnast not from the Soviet Union or Japan since 1952. It was Bulgaria's first-ever medal in the men's all-around. Japan, which had joined the American-led 1980 Summer Olympics boycott and did not compete, had its six-Games podium streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFive of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1976 Games returned: gold medalist Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Alexander Dityatin of the Soviet Union, sixth-place finisher Andrzej Szajna of Poland, seventh-place finisher Michael Nikolay of East Germany, and ninth-place finisher Zoltán Magyar of Hungary. The World Championships had shifted from a quadrennial (non-Olympic even years) to a biennial (odd years) event, so there had been two World Champions since the last Games: Andrianov (1978) and Dityatin (1979). Significant absences due to the American-led boycott included Kurt Thomas of the United States (second at the 1979 World Championships) and the entire Japanese team, especially Eizo Kenmotsu (second at the 1978 World Championships).\nBrazil made its debut in the event. France made its 16th appearance, most among nations (moving out of a tie with Italy, not competing in the event this time).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format followed the preliminary and final format introduced in 1972, with the limit on the number of finalists per nation added in 1976. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final, with the top 36 gymnasts advancing to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these scores plus half of the preliminary score resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. With half of the preliminary score and six more exercises scored 0 to 10, the final total was also from 0 to 120.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals.\nResults.\nSixty-eight gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 20 and 22. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 24. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes each gymnast's \"prelim\" score."

        "text": "The men's pommel horse competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29, 31 and August 4 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. There were 71 competitors from 19 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have to up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won in a tie between Li Ning of China, in the nation's debut in the Games, and Peter Vidmar, with the United States' first gold medal in the pommel horse since 1904 (and second overall) and first medal in the event since 1932. The bronze medal went to another American, Tim Daggett. The Soviet Union's eight-Games podium streak in the event ended with no Soviets competing due to the boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). None of the six finalists from 1980 returned, as all were from boycotting nations. With the absence of the Soviets, East Germans, and Hungary's Zoltán Magyar (who had retired anyway), the field was open to the traditional power Japan and rising powers China and the United States. Li Xiaoping and Li Ning of China had taken second and fourth, respectively, at the 1983 world championships, the highest rankings of the non-boycotting nations; Li Xiaoping had won the world championship in 1981.\nThe People's Republic of China and San Marino each made their debut in the men's pommel horse. The United States made its 14th appearance, breaking a tie with the absent Hungary for most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 pommel horse and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. \nThe 1984 Games expanded the number of finalists from six to eight. Nations were still limited to two finalists each. Others were ranked 9th through 71st. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nSeventy-one gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29 and 31. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 4. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

Competitors raced over five loops of a 2.5 kilometre skiing course, shooting twenty times, ten prone and ten standing. Each miss required a competitor to ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nThe starting order for the pursuit was based on the results of the sprint; the top 60 finishers in that race qualified for the pursuit. In addition, each racer's final deficit behind sprint winner Sven Fischer corresponded to their starting deficit in the pursuit; Halvard Hanevold, who finished 8 seconds behind Fischer in the sprint, started 8 seconds after him in the pursuit. The winner was the first racer over the finish line, Vincent Defrasne.\nOle Einar Bjørndalen was the defending World and Olympic champion in this event, but was ranked fourth in the World Cup standings before the Games, behind Germany's Michael Rösch, Frenchman Raphaël Poirée and another German, Sven Fischer. \nResults.\nTwo Austrian athletes were disqualified after the IOC determined they had violated the Anti-Doping rules; Wolfgang Rottmann had originally placed 21st, while Wolfgang Perner had placed 25th.\nThe race was held at 14:30."

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of seven fencing events on the Fencing at the 1924 Summer Olympics programme. It was the seventh appearance of the event, the only fencing event to have been on the programme at every Games. The competition was held from Tuesday July 16, 1924 to Thursday July 18, 1924. 47 fencers from 15 nations competed. Nations were limited to four fencers each, down from eight in 1920. The event was won by Sándor Pósta of Hungary, beginning a nine-Games streak in which Hungarians won the gold medal in the men's sabre (and was the third of eleven straight Games \"in which Hungary competed\" that a Hungarian won, with Hungary excluded from the 1920 competition). Roger Ducret of France took silver, while another Hungarian, János Garay, earned bronze.\nItalian Oreste Puliti was ejected from the competition: after the other Italian fencers in the final were accused of conspiring to lose to him in order to inflate his score, an enraged Puliti either assaulted the Hungarian judge who made the accusation, Gyorgy Kovacs, or threatened to do so. Four months later, the two duelled with real swords. The duel ended in a draw.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Four of the twelve finalists from 1920 returned: bronze medalist Adrianus de Jong of the Netherlands, fourth-place finisher Oreste Puliti of Italy, fifth-place finisher Jan van der Wiel of the Netherlands, and eighth-place finisher Robin Dalglish of Great Britain. De Jong had won the first two world championships in 1922 and 1923. Ivan Osiier of Denmark, in his fourth Olympics of seven in which he would compete, entered the sabre for the first time. The Hungarian team, which had claimed five of the six possible medals in 1908 and 1912 before being uninvited to the 1920 Games after World War I, returned to competition. Hungary was favored with multiple excellent fencers, but de Jong and Puliti were also strong contenders.\nArgentina, Chile, Norway, Turkey, and Uruguay each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy and Denmark each made their fifth appearance in the event, tied for most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a three-round format. In each round, the fencers were divided into pools to play a round-robin within the pool. Bouts were to four touches. Standard sabre rules applied.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced. Bouts were to four touches. Bout record was the primary determiner of rank; ties were broken first by the number of times touched, then by touches scored, and then by a tiebreaker pool if the fencers were still tied.\nQuarterfinal B.\nSola beat Kershaw 4–2 in the tiebreaker.\nSemifinals.\nThe top four fencers in each pool advanced. Bouts were to four touches. Bout record was the primary determiner of rank; ties were broken first by the number of times touched, then by touches scored, and then by a tiebreaker pool if the fencers were still tied.\nFinal.\nAfter Hungarian judge György Kovács ruled that the three Italian teammates of Oreste Puliti had thrown their matches to Puliti, Puliti became enraged, and in response he assaulted Kovács or threatened to do so, resulting in his ejection from the competition. The other Italians then immediately withdrew in protest, thus leaving only eight of the scheduled 12 finalists to compete.\nThere were three separate tie-breaker barrages used, involving seven of the eight fencers: a sixth/seventh place match, a fourth/fifth place match, and a three-way match to determine the medals.

        "title": "Handball in the United States",
        "text": "Handball in the United States is a minor sport. The U.S. is represented in international competitions, such as the Summer Olympics and the Pan American Games, by the United States men's national handball team and the United States women's national handball team. The U.S. men's and women's teams have struggled in international competitions against nations where handball is more popular.\nA common popular sport in European countries, handball is seldom seen in the United States. The sport is mostly played in the country on the amateur level. Handball is played in the Summer Olympics, but is not sanctioned by the NCAA; all college and university teams play as club teams. In 2020, a former USA Team Handball CEO Barry Siff said that they are planning to create an American professional team handball league sponsored by Verizon. They are planning to have the owners until the end of 2020, and to launch the league in 2023 with 10 teams with each team initially worth $3 million to $5 million and want to cooperate with NBA or NHL owners in one-tenant arena situations.\nIt is governed by USA Team Handball, which is funded in part by the U.S. Olympic Committee.\nPreviously, the governing body was the United States Team Handball Federation, but was revoked of its governing duties by the United States Olympic Committee.\nHandball is starting to be recognized by a few notable universities, such as West Point, The Ohio State University, University of North Carolina (UNC), Air Force, Texas A&amp;M University, University of Virginia and others. Those schools and academies along with other amateur teams participate in the Club National Championships and Collegiate National Championships, one for men and the other for women. There are also several club level leagues in various sections of the country, like the Midwest Team Handball League, Northeast Team Handball League, and the Great Lakes Team Handball Association.\nHistory.\nJohn Jakobs was the founder of the first handball section (First German Sport Club of Brooklyn) in the USA. On 26 May 1926 he made a call in the \"New Yorker Herold\" to promote handball.\nOn 28 October 1926 the first field handball game was played between the Turnverein Union City and the First German Sport Club of Brooklyn. The game ended in a 9 to 9 draw. Newark TV joined the other two and they played some friendly games.\nIn 1927 the German American Athletic Union (GAAU) started to sponsor field handball. The first handball chairman was Gustav Ricke from First German Sport Club of Brooklyn. In the season 1927-28 only friendly games were played.\nProfessional leagues.\nIn 1978, the National Teamball League was formed with six clubs: the Detroit Hawks, Chicago Chiefs, Boston Comets, New York Stags, Philadelphia Warriors and Pittsburgh Points. The NTL (described as an \"Americanized\" version of team handball, with faster play and higher scores) was bankrolled by Aben Johnson, Jr., owner of WXON-TV in Detroit, and WXON aired the league's first game, a 48-26 victory by Detroit over Chicago. The match, played in front of about 800 people at Macomb County Community College in Warren, Michigan, was taped in early December and aired on WXON on Friday, December 8, 1978, and again the next day.\nThe Hawks-Chiefs matchup was the only NTL match known to have been televised; in fact, it was one of the few known to have been \"played\", as press coverage of the loop was almost nonexistent. A local Boston-area newspaper, the \"Charlestown Patriot and Somerville Chronicle\", covered at least one of their matches, as the Comets played at Medford Street Gym in Charlestown, Massachusetts with several local players. After a win over Detroit (the Hawks' first loss of the season) on February 3, 1979, the Comets record was reported as 4-0, including two victories over Philadelphia in December. Whether the league's first season (scheduled to run through April 1979) was completed is unknown; most likely, the NTL died quickly and disappeared. (\"National Teamball League, Inc.\" was incorporated by Johnson in August 1978 and dissolved in March 1980.)\nIn 2020, former USA Team Handball CEO Barry Siff stated that plans were in development to create an American professional team handball league. The new, unnamed league's launch is scheduled for 2023, with 10 teams initially worth three to five million dollars apiece. There are also plans to cooperate with NBA or NHL owners in one-tenant arena situations, and perhaps create multisports clubs like FC Barcelona or Paris Saint-Germain.\nBecause handball was part of the 1936 Summer Olympics the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) started to sponsor field handball in 1934. Many of the handball leaders of the DAAV were chosen to lead the handball committee of the AAU.\nIn 1942 the Office of Alien Property Custodian seized all records of the German American Athletic Union.\nAfter World War II, handball had no national body until 1959 as the United States Team Handball Federation was founded. In the same year, the United States Handball Federation League was founded. The Elizabeth S.C. won at least all season until 1967. In 1962, nine teams from New York and New Jersey played in the league as a winter conditioner for soccer. In 1963, 20 teams with 200 players competed in handball.\nMiddle school.\nSan Francisco Bay Area.\nThe Youth Team Handball Middle School League and Youth California Cup organized by San Francisco CalHeat THC are the only competitions accommodating middle school in the USA.\nCurrent members of the Youth Team Handball Middle School League:\nPast members of the Youth Team Handball Middle School League:\nHigh school.\nSan Francisco Bay Area.\nThe Youth Team Handball High School League and Youth California Cup organized by San Francisco CalHeat THC are the high school competitions in the SF Bay Area.\nCurrent members of the Youth Team Handball High School League:\nPast members of the Youth Team Handball High School League:\nMontgomery County, Maryland.\nThe MCPS Athletics offers team handball as corollary sports.\nCurrent members of the MCPS handball:\nFormer members of the MCPS handball:"

        "title": "John Dyke (rugby union)",
        "text": "John Charles Meredith Dyke (20 June 1884 – 9 July 1960) was a former international rugby union fullback. Dyke made his debut for Wales on 1 December 1906 versus South Africa and was selected for the 1908 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. He played club rugby for Penarth and London Welsh.\nRugby career.\nDyke was educated at Christ College, Brecon, which already had a history of producing notable international rugby players. He played for the College team, and on completing his education began playing for Penarth. At the start of the 1905/06 season Dyke was given the captaincy of the Penarth senior team, and held it for two seasons. It was while with Penarth that Dyke played his most notable games, and his first experience of international rugby came in 1905, when he was selected to play for Glamorgan against the Original All Blacks. The Glamorgan match was played just five days after New Zealand's historic clash with Wales, and the majority of the Welsh team were expected to turn out for the Glamorgan game. With the match approaching the majority of the team dropped out, including Wales fullback Bert Winfield. Dyke was called up as Winfield's replacement and turned out against New Zealand at St Helen's in Swansea on 21 December. Glamorgan lost by three tries to nil.\nA year later Dyke was involved in a turn around of events when chosen to win his first full international cap against the 1906 touring South Africans. The Welsh leg of the South African tour began with wins over Newport and Glamorgan, and the full back position in the Glamorgan game was given to Winfield. A month later, when the Welsh team was named, Dyke was given the fullback position. Dyke was one of three new caps against the Springboks, but critics felt that in their club games running up to the international encounter none of the players reached their full potential, but were better than any of their rivals. Dyke was chosen over Winfield as the South Africans had an impressive rushing tactic and Winfield's defence was not as strong as Dyke's. On the other hand, Winfield had an exceptional spiral punt, which was not matched in Wales until Vivian Jenkins in the 1930s, and Dyke's kicking was considered as far inferior. The Welsh team were beaten heavily, but if it hadn't been for Dyke the scoreline may well have been much worse, as his heavy tackling as the last defence prevented further runaway scoring. Dyke is also recorded as the only Wales player to increase his reputation during the game, but despite this he never represented Wales again.\nDyke played several games in England and represented London Welsh, Coventry and played 2 games for Leicester on their north-east tour in 1908, but always retained his loyalty to Penarth. In 1908 Dyke was one of three Penarth players to be selected to join the Anglo-Welsh team on their tour of Australia and New Zealand. Dyke and fellow Penarth player Len Thomas made the trip, but Thomas' brother Ralph, was injured before the tour embarked for Australia and dropped out. Dyke played in thirteen games of the tour, but was not selected for any of the test games. During his return to Britain he rejoined Penarth, and in the 1908/09 season was invited to join invitational touring team, the Barbarians."

        "text": "James Robert Walton (born June 5, 1934, at Shattuck, Oklahoma) is an American Major League Baseball scout, who served for three seasons (1973–1975) in MLB as the first base coach for the Milwaukee Brewers of the American League. Walton threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nHe played in the Baltimore Orioles, Washington Senators and Cincinnati Reds farm systems (1954–1955; 1959–1960), as an infielder, outfielder and pitcher. In he joined the Houston Colt .45s' organization as a minor league manager — one year before the Houston team debuted in MLB. He managed in the Georgia–Florida League in 1962–1963, filling in as an active player during the 1962 season. He then scouted for Colt .45s/Astros through 1971, when he moved to the Brewers as a scout and interim manager at the Double-A level, with the 1972 San Antonio Brewers of the Texas League.\nWalton was added to the staff as first base coach and third base coach of Milwaukee manager Del Crandall for the season, and served for three full campaigns. Walton also served as a coach to the American League Team for the 1975 All-Star Game. After Crandall and his staff were fired at the close of , Walton became an area scout with the Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau. He is based in his hometown of Shattuck.\nIn addition to continuing scouting for the Major League Scouting Bureau, Walton was appointed as the Advance Scout for Team USA's baseball team and was a part of the team for their Olympic Gold Medal win in the Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia in 2000. Walton continues to work tirelessly with prospective baseball players from all ages.

        "text": "Ernest Raymond \"Roy\" John (3 December 1925 – 30 September 1981) was a and British Lions international rugby union lock. He played club rugby for Crynant and Neath. John was capped 19 times for Wales and was a member of two Grand Slam winning teams. In 1950 he was selected for the 1950 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. John was an agile runner for a lock, but was most notable for his excellent ability in line-outs.\nRugby career.\nJohn played rugby from a young age and represented his local grammar school as a youth. His first club was Crynant, but by the time he gained his first cap in 1950 he had switched to first-class side Neath. His international debut came on 21 January against England as part of the 1950 Five Nations Championship. John gained his place as his club partner, Rees Stephens had been forced to withdraw from the team. John was one of five new caps entering a team that had finished bottom of the table in the year's previous tournament. Wales beat England 11–5 and John was reselected for the remaining three matches of the campaign. After wins over Scotland and Ireland to take the Triple Crown, John scored his first and only try for Wales in a victory over France to give the team the Grand Slam title.\nTwo months after the encounter with France, John was playing for the British Lions team touring Australia and New Zealand. Both he and Stephens were selected becoming the first players to represent the Lions from the Neath club. He played in twenty-two matches of the tour and played in all six Test matches. During the tour he scored two tries, one in the win against a joint Manawatu–Horowhenua team, and the other in the second Test against Australia. During the tour, John was used in three of the Tests as a number 8, both the Australian matches and the third Test to New Zealand at Wellington. During the 1950–51 season John was given the captaincy of the Neath team.\nJohn was back in the Wales squad for the 1951 Five Nations Championship playing in all four matches. Despite a resounding win over England in the opening match, Wales ended the competition on third after draw with Ireland and loses to France and Ireland. The same year John faced the 1951 touring South Africa team. First at club level when a joint Aberavon and Neath team on 17 November, and then a country level with Wales, twice ending on the losing side. Despite losing to the South Africans with Wales, John so dominated the line-out that the Springboks' coach, Danie Craven, ordered his team not to contest them.\nJohn continued his unbroken run of Wales appearances with another four games in the 1952 Five Nations Championship. The pivotal game of the tournament turned out to be the team's first match away to England. England led the encounter in the first half with England scoring two tries when key Welsh player Lewis Jones was off the pitch for treatment. Wales responded strongly in the second half led by their pack with John dominating the line-out. Wales went on to win all three remaining games giving John his second Grand Slam title. 1952 also saw Neath tour Ireland, which John joined despite being on honeymoon there.\n1953 saw John complete his fourth full Championship, in which Wales came second, losing just one game to eventual winners England. John's penultimate international came in December 1953, when he was chosen to face the touring New Zealand team. Although John no longer possessed his old agility, a storming response from the forwards saw Wales snatch their last win over the All Blacks that century. John faced the same New Zealand team in late January 1954, when another joint Aberavon/Neath team lost 11–5 to the tourists.\nJohn's final international, his nineteenth consecutive game for Wales, was an away match to England, which Wales lost through a last minute try from England's Chris Winn.\nPlaying style.\nWhile a youth at Neath Grammar School, John had played on the wing, at centre and at fly-half before moving into the back row. Despite his height, at 6 ft 3ins, John possessed a swerve and dummy more worthy of a half-back. He was used as a number 8 during the Lions tour, and once as a Wales international played as flanker. Of all his rugby abilities, John is best remembered for his strength in the line-out. John had a powerful standing leap and was reported to be able to leap up and grab onto a rugby crossbar, set at 10 ft 6ins above the ground.\nInternational matches played.\nWales\nBritish Lions"

        "title": "Austin Davis (American football)",
        "text": "Austin Davis (born June 2, 1989) is an American football coach and former player. He played as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) for 7 seasons, playing for the St. Louis Rams, the Miami Dolphins, the Cleveland Browns, the Denver Broncos, the Seattle Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans. He played college football for the Southern Miss Golden Eagles, where he began his career as a walk-on, he redshirted the 2007 season and became the starter a year later. He ended the year with a combined total of 15 school records for both game and single-season marks and led the Golden Eagles to a bowl game victory in the 2008 New Orleans Bowl, being named to the freshman all-C-USA team.\nDavis most recently served as the offensive coordinator for the Auburn Tigers but left the program within two months and coaching no games. Prior to Auburn, he was the quarterbacks coach for the Seattle Seahawks for two seasons.\nEarly years.\nDavis was born on June 2, 1989. Davis attended West Lauderdale High School in Collinsville, Mississippi, where he was coached by Stan McCain. He would become the winningest quarterback in the school's history. As a senior, Davis threw for 1,100 yards passing with 15 touchdowns, rushed for 600 yards with six touchdowns and recorded a 67 percent completion rating. He was a four-year letterwinner and was named team MVP. During his career, Davis received all-area honors, was named best offensive back in the district and played in the Mississippi/Alabama All-Star game.\nDavis' cousin, Jason Smith, had a nine-year career in Major League Baseball and his brother, Bo, played baseball for the San Diego Padres organization and helped lead the Southern Miss Golden Eagles to their first College World Series appearance. Davis was also an all-state baseball player in high school.\nCollege career.\nDavis' only football scholarship offer came from Southeastern Louisiana of the Football Championship Subdivision. He chose instead to attend the University of Southern Mississippi on a baseball scholarship.\nDavis was a walk-on to the Southern Miss football program and redshirted the 2007 season. For 2008, Davis was named the starting quarterback by head coach Larry Fedora and became the first freshman to be named the starting quarterback at Southern Miss since Tommy Waters in 1991. Davis began the season with five 200-yard passing games, more than any other Southern Miss quarterback has put together, and nine altogether for the season, tying a school record for most in a season. For the year, Davis set a new school record with 3,128 passing yards and broke Brett Favre's school record for most touchdown passes by a freshman with 23. He ended the year with a combined total of 15 school records for both game and single-season marks, which included most passing yards in a game (461) and most rushing touchdowns in a contest (5) as well as total offense for a season (3,323). Davis was ranked 16th nationally in total offense (279.7) and 52nd in passing efficiency (128.6) in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). His total offense average was the highest among freshmen quarterbacks in the country, ahead of the likes of Kellen Moore of Boise State (265.9) and Robert Griffin of Baylor (244.5). In the 2008 New Orleans Bowl, Davis threw for 276 yards and two touchdowns and became the first freshman quarterback to lead the Golden Eagles to a bowl game victory. Davis was named to the All-Conference USA freshman team and a freshman All-American honorable mention by CollegeFootballNews.com. Before the 2009 season, Davis was named on the Manning Award watch list.\nDavis got off to another great start in the 2009 season by completing 108–156 passes (69%) for 1,165 yards and 10 touchdowns against just 2 interceptions. He gained some national notoriety following a 35–28 loss to nationally ranked Kansas, in which Davis matched All-American candidate Todd Reesing yard for yard. However, his promising start was cut short by a broken foot suffered in the fifth game of the season against UAB.\nDavis returned in 2010 and put up another good season, throwing for 3,103 yards with 20 touchdowns against just 6 interceptions while running for another 452 yards and 10 touchdowns. On November 30, Southern Miss went on the road to face the eventual C-USA and Liberty Bowl champion Central Florida and their highly rated defense. Davis responded by completing 21–34 passes for 264 yard and 4 scores, leading the Golden Eagles to a 31–21 road upset over the ranked Knights. He delivered an encore the next week in an emotional game against the Houston Cougars. Following the shooting of three teammates, Davis responded with the best game of his career, completing 24 of 31 passes for 293 yards and 2 scores while running for 111 yards and 4 more scores as Southern Miss topped Houston 59–41. In the Papajohns.com Bowl against Louisville, Davis passed Brett Favre on the schools passing touchdown record with a 32-yard pass to Quentin Pierce in the first quarter. Davis would go on to throw another touchdown as well as catch one in the 31–28 loss.\nHeading into his senior season, Davis had either broken or was on the verge of breaking nearly every passing record in Southern Miss history. He passed Favre's yardage record in the second game of the season at Marshall. Davis had arguably his best career performance on October 8, at Navy. He completed 21 of his 23 passes for 283 yards and 3 scores as well as running for 75 yards and another score, posting a QB rating of 237.7. Davis led the Golden Eagles to a C-USA Eastern Division championship and a spot in the conference championship game against undefeated and 6th ranked Houston and their record setting quarterback Case Keenum. Despite being a 15-point underdog and being overshadowed by Keenum prior to the game, Davis outplayed Keenum, connecting on 17 of 34 passes for 276 yards and 4 touchdowns as he led Southern Miss to one of the biggest wins in school history. Davis finished his career with a 24–17 victory in the Hawaii bowl over Nevada. Davis' last pass as a collegiate quarterback was a touchdown in the final minutes to secure the win. Davis ended the 2011 season throwing for 3,496 yards and 30 touchdowns, both school records, while also rushing for 352 yards and four touchdowns. At the conclusion of his senior season he was named the winner of the Conerly Trophy, an award given annually to the best college football player in the state of Mississippi by the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame.\nHis final stats were: 933–1527 (61.1%) for 10,898 yards, 83 touchdowns against just 27 interceptions. He also ran the ball 460 times for 1,375 yards and 25 touchdowns. He also caught 2 passes for 25 yards and a touchdown. Davis accounted for 109 touchdowns in his four-year career.\nProfessional football career.\nDavis was rated the 13th best quarterback in the 2012 NFL Draft by NFLDraftScout.com. Prior to the Draft, Bleacher Report's Tyler Ward named Davis as one of his eleven potential late-round sleepers.\nSt. Louis Rams (first stint).\nDavis went undrafted in the 2012 NFL Draft and signed a free agent deal with the St. Louis Rams. On August 30, 2013, he was cut by the Rams.\nMiami Dolphins.\nThe Miami Dolphins signed Davis to their practice squad on September 10, 2013.

In the first week of the 2014 NFL season against the Minnesota Vikings, Davis entered the game at the start of the second half in relief of starter Shaun Hill. A week later, due to Hill's injury, Davis made his NFL starting debut on September 14, in a winning effort against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nFollowing the Rams' 28–26 upset win over the defending Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks in Week 7, former All-Pro quarterback and legend Brett Favre tabbed Davis as a potential Tom Brady or Kurt Warner of the future, both of whom won Super Bowls despite a bleak start to their NFL careers. During the victory, Davis completed 17-of-20 passes, the best completion percentage in NFL history against a defending Super Bowl champion; the former Southern Miss QB also added 152 passing yards and two touchdowns, one of which ultimately sealed their victory after Davis successfully led an 80-yard drive.\nAfter two interceptions and a lost fumble in the 4th quarter against the Arizona Cardinals in early November, Davis was benched in favor of Hill.\nOn September 5, 2015, Davis was released by the Rams.\nCleveland Browns.\nOn September 7, 2015, Davis signed with the Cleveland Browns. He signed a two-year, $4.137 million contract extension on September 30.\nHe played in relief of an injured Josh McCown in the Week 12 game against the Baltimore Ravens. He completed 7 of 10 passes for 77 yards, drove for a game-tying touchdown, and led the Browns into position for a game-winning field goal, but the team lost when the field goal was blocked and returned for a touchdown.\nAfter McCown was ruled out for the rest of the season, Davis was named the Browns starter for the following week over Johnny Manziel. Following a 37–3 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, Davis was replaced as starter by Manziel. He played again in the season finale against the Pittsburgh Steelers after Manziel was ruled out with a concussion, going 24 for 46 with no touchdowns and a pair of interceptions in a 28–12 loss.\nHe was released by the Browns on August 29, 2016.\nDenver Broncos.\nDavis signed a one-year contract with the Denver Broncos on September 3, 2016.

        "text": "The men's individual all-around competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29, 31 and August 2 at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion. There were 71 competitors from 19 nations. Each nation could send a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Kōji Gushiken of Japan, the nation's fourth victory in the event (tying Italy for second-most at the time, behind the Soviet Union's five). The United States won its first medal in the event since the 1904 Games in St. Louis with Peter Vidmar's silver. China, making its debut in the event, received bronze with Li Ning finishing third.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nNone of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1980 Games returned; 9 of the 10 were from nations that boycotted the 1984 Games, while Dan Grecu of Romania had retired after being injured in 1980 (his fourth Games). The highest-ranked finisher from Moscow to return was 20th-place finisher Michel Boutard of France. The Soviets, absent from Los Angeles, had taken four of the seven medals at the two World Championships since Moscow; Kōji Gushiken of Japan had taken two of the rest (bronze in 1981, silver in 1983) and Lou Yun had shared bronze in 1983 for the last one.\nThe People's Republic of China and San Marino each made their debut in the event. France made its 17th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition format followed the preliminary and final format introduced in 1972, with the limit on the number of finalists per nation added in 1976. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final, with the top 36 gymnasts advancing to the individual all-around final—except that each nation was limited to 3 finalists. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these scores plus half of the preliminary score resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. With half of the preliminary score and six more exercises scored 0 to 10, the final total was also from 0 to 120.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals.\nResults.\nSeventy-one gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29 and 31. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 2. Each country was limited to three competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes each gymnast's \"prelim\" score."

        "title": "Mercyhurst Lakers women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Mercyhurst Lakers women's ice hockey team is a college ice hockey program representing Mercyhurst University in NCAA Division I competition as a member of the College Hockey America (CHA) conference. They play in Erie, Pennsylvania at the Mercyhurst Ice Center, located on the Mercyhurst campus.\nThe program was started in 1999 and Michael Sisti has been its only coach. From 2000 to 2002, the Lakers were part of the Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association (GLWHA). While in the Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association, the Lakers qualified for the GLWHA tournament twice – in 2001, and 2002. The Lakers were regular season champions in 2000–01 and 2001–02, and won the playoff championship in 2002. For the 2002–03 season, the Lakers joined the College Hockey America conference.\nHistory.\n1999 to 2002: Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association\nThe Mercyhurst women's hockey program predates NCAA governance in the sport. The Great Lakes Women's Hockey Association was formed by Mercyhurst University in Erie, Pennsylvania, the University of Findlay in Findlay, Ohio and Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, when the Title IX law protecting equity in sports was making major changes to women's athletics.\nA Mercyhurst Men's Assistant Coach since 1993, Michael Sisti, was named the inaugural head coach. As of the end of the 2019–20 season, he remains the only head coach in the program's history. Sisti had been a star forward for Canisius College, where he graduated in 1990.\nMercyhurst was immediately successful in the GLWHA. They were 23-6-0 in 1999–00. Most of their games were shutout wins, and scored 10 or more goals on six occasions.\nIn 2000-01 they were far less successful, going 14-16-3, playing more established programs.\nIn 2001–02, they saw great success again, with a 24-8-1 record, and the final GLWHA Championship.\nCollege Hockey America through 2005-06\nAs the NCAA became the primary governing body of women's hockey, the conferences began to merge with existing men's conferences. The Mercyhurst men were part of the Metro Atlantic Conference, while Findlay and Wayne States' men's programs were in College Hockey America, which began organizing as a women's conference as well. The new CHA women's conference included Mercyhust, Findlay and Wayne State from the GLWHA, and Niagara University.\nIn the first four years of the conference, Mercyhurst dominated the competition. Within the conference, they were 38-1-3, winning every regular season, and every tournament. Their overall record was 102-29-13 for the same period. In the first two years of the conference, the CHA a smaller conference against much more storied conferences, like the ECAC and the WCHA. As a result, Mercyhurst did not receive a bid to appear in the NCAA Tournament. In 2005, the Lakers received their first bid, traveling to powerful Harvard University on March 19. The ensuing game was one of the most bitterly fought in tournament history, with Harvard prevailing 5–4 in the third overtime period. During that game, Mercyhurst goaltender Desirae \"Desi\" Clark set a single game save record of 78 stops. That record still stands at the Division I level , the end of the 2019–20 season. In the following year, the Lakers had similar bad luck, this time losing to Wisconsin in 2 overtimes.\nThe CHA Conference saw some changes, as Findlay dropped their program in 2004, and the Robert Morris Colonials joining for 2005–06, after Quinnipiac joined for a single year (2004–05).\nThe Meghan Agosta years\nBy the mid-2000s Mercyhurst College (it would become Mercyhurst University in 2012), had several advantages in recruiting: The college itself, a small Catholic institution with very good academics; The success and graduation rate of its athletes; and, the overwhelming success of the team. The campus location near Lake Ontario was attractive to young women from Ontario, New York and Pennsylvania, a large pool of talent.\nIn 2006, the Lakers attracted Megan Agosta, perhaps the most sought-after talent in the NCAA. Even before attending college, she had won an Olympic gold medal at the 2006 Turin games with Team Canada. She became one of the best players of the decade in NCAA play.\nAgosta would be the first ever freshman to be a top three finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award.\nIn 2007, Mercyhurst successfully recruited Vicki Bendus, who would win the 2010 Patty Kazmaier Award as the nation's top player, and was a top-10 finalist in the following year.\nIn addition, the Lakers recruited Katariina Soikkanen of the Finnish National team, as well as Angelica Lorsell and Johanna Malmstrom who played for the Swedish National Team. The Lakers also had four players on the roster who played on the Canadian Under-22 Team. Mercyhurst had two CHA First Team selections in 2006–07, one second team choice, the Player and Rookie of the Year, and four members of the All-Rookie Team.\nWith the addition of these players, in addition to a potent roster in totality, Mercyhurst achieved even more success.\nDuring her college career, Agosta would score 157 goals and 303 points, both NCAA records. Her international play meant substantial time off from the Mercyhurst team, making these records all the more impressive.\nThe best year in Mercyhurst history came in 2009–10. In that season, the Lakers started the season with a record of 19 wins, 1 loss and 3 ties (Conference Record, 6–0–1). They were the top ranked team in the USA TODAY/USA Hockey Magazine poll for 14 consecutive weeks and were the unanimous choice with all 19 first-place votes eight times. Their only loss came in an October home split with Minnesota-Duluth until the Nation Championship game against Wisconsin on March 22, 2009, which they lost 5–0. It was the Laker's only NCAA Championship Game. During that season, Meghan Agosto took time away to participate in her second Olympic games, this time in Vancouver, Canada. She won her second gold medal and was named the Most Valuable Player in women's hockey in the Olympic Games.\nContinued Success in the 2010s\nTo date, the Mercyhurst program continues to be successful, if no longer dominant in the CHA conference. In 2013 and 2014, the Lakers appeared in back-to-back Frozen Four contests. These teams were led by forward Christine Bestland, a captain for two years, national recognition by USCHO. com, and two time MVP of the CHA conference.\nUpon Bestland's graduation, Mercyhurst's successes were more modest, despite the leadership of forward Emily Janiga and defenseman Molly Byrne. The Lakers earned their record-setting 10th consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance in 2014.\nIn 2015, Mercyhurst failed to earn a berth in the national tournament, while still posting a 23-9-3 record and a regular season conference title. In the following year, the team returned to the tournament after a one-year hiatus.\nFrom 2017 to 2019, the Lakers enjoyed success, but contended with rival CHA program Robert Morris for conference leadership. The 2016-17 team posted a 15-18-4 record, their first and only losing record since NCAA competition began in 2001–02, as of the end of 2020. Their 3rd place CHA finish was the lowest ranking in Mercyhurst history, but still good enough for the team to stay in the top tier of the conference.\nIn the 2017–18 season, Mercyhurst began to establish a resurgence of top-tier success, with the recruiting of three international medalists from the Finnish national team: forward Vilma Tanskanen (2018–19), forward Emma Nuutinen (2017–2020), and goaltender Jenna Silvonen (2019–). Tanskanen and Nuutinen were transfers from the North Dakota Fighting Hawks women's ice hockey team, following the abrupt cancellation of the University of North Dakota‘s program.

Ultimately, FIS decided to award the discipline trophy to the leader after two events, Lindsey Vonn, giving her four crystal globes for the year (overall, downhill, Super G and combined)."

The qualification and final rounds took place on July 20, 22 and 25th at the Luzhniki Palace of Sports. There were 65 competitors from 14 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have to up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union, the first man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the vault. Andrianov was also the first (and, as of the 2016 Games, only) man to win a third medal in the event, with a bronze in 1972 along with his 1976 and 1980 gold medals. For the eighth consecutive Games, the Soviets had a gymnast in the top two in vault; this time, they had both the top two, as Alexander Dityatin took silver. Roland Brückner of East Germany earned bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Three of the six finalists from 1976 returned: gold medalist Nikolai Andrianov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Dan Grecu of Romania, and fifth-place finisher Zoltán Magyar of Hungary. Andrianov had finished second to fellow Soviet Alexander Dityatin in the 1979 world championships. The American-led boycott resulted in there being no competitors from either the traditional men's gymnastics power of Japan or the rising power of the United States; the Soviets' dominance this Games would be challenged only by the East Germans.\nBrazil made its debut in the men's vault. Hungary made its 13th appearance, tying the United States (absent from the vault event for the first time since the inaugural 1896 Games) for most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals, except that nations were limited to two finalists each; others were ranked 7th through 65th. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nSixty-five gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 20 and 22. The six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 25. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

        "text": "Sanath Jayasuriya is a Sri Lankan cricketer and former captain of the Sri Lanka national cricket team. He is an all-rounder and opening batsman, and is known for his aggressive batting style that has earned him the name \"Master Blaster\". His batting style introduced a new strategy to the game during the 1996 World Cup, where he and fellow opener Romesh Kaluwitharana batted highly aggressively in the early overs using fielding restrictions to their advantage. This later became a standard opening batting strategy and, according to Australian cricketer Glenn McGrath, Jayasuriya \"changed everyone's thinking about how to start innings\". As a result of his performances, Jayasuriya was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1997, despite not having played in the previous English cricketing season. He scored 42 centuries in Test and One Day International (ODI) games, but was not able to score a century in a Twenty20 International match, where his highest score is 88.\nAlthough Jayasuriya made his Test debut in 1991, it was not until 1996 that he scored his first century, when he had become a regular player in the Sri Lankan side. His career high of 340 against India in August 1997 was the highest score by a Sri Lankan cricketer until 2006 and is also part of the highest team total (952/6) made in Test cricket. He has also scored two double centuries; 213 against England and 253 against Pakistan. His 157 against Zimbabwe in 2004 is the second fastest century by a Sri Lankan player. Jayasuriya, having scored centuries against every Test playing nation except New Zealand and the West Indies, retired from Test cricket in 2007 with 14 to his name.\nJayasuriya made his ODI debut in 1989 and started playing as an opening batsman in 1993. He went on to score his first century in 1994 against New Zealand. From then on, Jayasuriya has scored the highest number of ODI centuries for Sri Lanka with 28 to his name. , he holds fourth place for the most ODI centuries in a career, behind Virat Kohli (50 centuries), Sachin Tendulkar (49 centuries) and Ricky Ponting (30 centuries). His second century, 134 against Pakistan in 1996, was scored at a strike rate of 206.15 and was the fastest century in ODI cricket at the time. This record was later broken by Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi. The 189 he made against India in 2000 is the sixth highest ODI score in a single innings. Making his second highest ODI score of 157 against the Netherlands in 2006, Jayasuriya paved the way for Sri Lanka to set the world record for the highest ODI team total of 443/9. With his 107 against India on 28 January 2009, Jayasuriya—39 years and 212 days old at the time—became the oldest player to score a century, and also became the second player to score more than 13,000 runs in a career."

        "text": "These are the official results of the Men's 400 metres Hurdles event at the 1987 IAAF World Championships in Rome, Italy. There were a total number of 47 participating athletes, with six qualifying heats, two semi-finals and the final held on Tuesday 1987-09-01.\nSummary.\nAfter 122 consecutive victories, Edwin Moses's winning streak was finally broken in June by Danny Harris. Harris was in lane 5, while Moses was in lane three. Between them was Harald Schmid, the man who had last beaten Moses at the beginning of the streak. Surrounding them were the usual suspects of 1980's long hurdling.\nFrom the gun, Moses took the race out hard, making up the stagger to catch Schmid just past the fourth hurdle. Harris was also out fast but not as aggressively as Moses, taking hurdles one stride behind. Running his famous 13 steps, Moses pulled away through the final turn as Schmid accelerated to keep pace. He had a two-metre lead coming of the 9th hurdle with Schmid passing Harris as Harris took the hurdle leaning back. Moses maintained his lead over the final hurdle as Harris fought back to a slight advantage against Schmid. But Moses was struggling to maintain his stride, Harris had the momentum and Schmid was responding to the challenge. The gap was disappearing as all three were fighting to get to the line. Moses dived for the line in desperation, Harris maintained form and Schmid gave a textbook lean reminiscent of Colin Jackson to try to get ahead. In the closest 400 metres hurdles race in World Championship history, Moses saved the victory in 47.46, while Harris and Schmid were given the same time of 47.48, with Harris getting the nod for silver.\nAfter 11 years of chasing Moses, it was a European record and personal best for Schmid. Schmid's record would last almost 8 years and still ranks #16 on the all-time list. It was a World Championship record for Moses.\nSemi-finals.\n&lt;br&gt;\nQualifying heats.\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "YMCA Baseball Team",
        "text": "YMCA Baseball Team () is a semi-historical 2002 South Korean comedy film.\nIn 1905, there was a confluence of international events leading to the loss of Chosŏn Korean sovereignty, and by 1910, Japan formally annexed Korea outright. The Japanese, having already defeated Qing China (1895) and signed an alliance with the United Kingdom (1902), defeated Imperial Russia (1905), and came to an understanding with the United States (the Taft-Katsura Agreement of 1905) to respect each other's colonial \"Spheres of Influence\" in the Pacific. In these chaotic times, an eclectic group of Koreans find refuge in the quintessentially American pastime.\nPlot.\nThe film plays out as a flashback, experienced by a young Korean boy, as he, like his great-great-grandfather prepares to play baseball. \nThe flashback opens with the protagonist of the film, Yi Ho-chang, and his friend in a field. The two are supposed to be studying; however Yi Ho-chang is preoccupied with his soccer ball, which he accidentally kicks into a nearby property. Ho-chang climbs the gate to retrieve his ball, and finds himself within the walls of the American Christian missionary school. There he discovers a much smaller and harder ball, which he comically mistakes for his shrunken soccer ball. At this point a Christian missionary appears and explains to the confused Ho-chang that he is in fact holding a baseball. Ho-chang quickly flees the premise; however his fascination with the new sport ensures his return for further investigation. Ho-chang, accompanied by several interested Koreans return to the school to join the YMCA baseball league. \nThe unlikely group, and their female coach, Min Jung-rim prove to be successful, and quickly become the pride of their town.\nThroughout the film Ho-chang falls madly in love with his un-interested female coach, adding to the comic relief. One day while headed to practice the team is confronted by a group of Japanese soldiers, who claim that their practice ground is a new Japanese training camp. To settle the dispute one of the team members, Oh Dae-hyeon, who went to school in Tokyo with the Japanese Officer, suggests a competitive game of baseball. The game would not only settle the dispute, but it would also be a way for the Koreans to establish themselves against Japan, and for the players to further prove themselves to the skeptics of their town. Meanwhile, a more serious dispute is going on between the Korean diplomats and the revolutionary thinkers, over the signing of the Eulsa Treaty that officially made Korea a protectorate of Japan. Coincidentally, Oh Dae-hyeon and Min Jong-rim are members of the Anti-Eulsa League, an organization formed in protest of the Five Eulsa Traitors, which one of their teammate's, Kwang-tae, father belongs to. Due to all of the suppressed tension, the YMCA team loses to the Japanese, also losing their chance to dignify themselves in the face of their suppressors. \nDevastated over the loss, the team members decide to abandon baseball and return to more practical roles in society. Ho-chang fulfills his fathers wish and takes over the family school, despite his desires to become a great baseball player. In the end, the team reunites for one final and quite dramatic rematch against the Japanese. The Koreans victory in this rematch symbolizes their unity in baseball, and their ability to come together despite the social and cultural issues facing the changing country.\nHistorical relationship.\nThe film is a comically enhanced interpretation of the historical events of the first Korean baseball team during early 1905. The events, which took place prior to the film, denote what took place historically and how a Japanese occupation came to Korea are listed as follows. The forceful opening of Japanese connections by the Americans between 1852 and 1854 by Commodore Matthew Perry had caused an internal restructuring of government by the Japanese known as the Meiji Restoration that began in 1868. Prior to Perry's arrival, the Japanese would only permit trade with the Dutch (East India Company) and any foreigner found in Japanese territory was, in most cases, promptly executed, often by beheading. During the Meiji restoration, Japanese focused on industrialization of Japan to reignite the Imperial glory of Japan, a country also known as Nippon. As with most imperial governments of the early 20th century, militarization and conquest through industrial and technological prowess ensured a place in the handful of nations that took part in global leadership. At the time, Britain was one of the most powerful nations on Earth and had the best Navy. Russia's government, an autocracy ruled by Czar Nicholas II, had been undergoing industrial development some years and now Russia was making way to expand its borders. As vast as Russia's territory is, most of its population lives in the warmer western borders of the nation. Between 1897 and 1898, Russia had arrived in Port Arthur, Manchuria and succeeded in securing a lease with the Chinese to use the harbor. China at that time was under the bindings of a non-exclusivity agreement with what was then known as the Great British Empire that forbade them to purchase goods from other countries. This agreement also led to the Boxer rebellion that ended in 1901. China had become rather weak after the Ming Dynasty and continually made concessions to foreign nations in trade rights and permission to settle inside its borders. Thus, it was taken for an easy target by many foreign nations, including Russia and Japan. Japan has had a historically unpleasant sentiment towards for China and Korea and with the Meiji restoration and militaristic buildup of Japanese forces, Japan sought to expand its borders much like Russia did. The western nations were extending each of their hands and negotiating or conquering more territory and resources. In almost direct relation to the west, Japan flexed its imperial capacity as well. Korea was a buffer zone between Japan and the Chinese mainland and provide an access conduit to all measure of logistical and consumable resources. If Japan was able to hold control or sovereignty over Korea, it would tactically ensure the safety of the Japanese homeland from attack and therefore was considered a highly valuable asset. In 1875, Japan had forced Korea to declare itself as an independent nation apart from China through force and open its borders. Korea traditionally had been a protectorate nation under Chinese authority. Over time after it became clear what this meant for Korea and China, Qing China attempted to recant the declaration against Japan and in August 1894 Japan began fighting with Qing (Chin) forces over the Korean Peninsula, known as the First Sino-Chinese war (1894–1895).\nThe film \"YMCA Baseball\" takes places after these events have occurred and Japan has occupied Korea as a protectorate state of Japan. The Japanese have a highly invested interest in maintaining control of Korea and make every attempt to prohibit any inkling of resistance or possibility of uprising by the Korean people as portrayed by the film although somewhat overly exuberant. Korea's future lay uncertain and coincided with national sentiment of oppression towards the Japanese. With the Chosun dynasty ending and large western and other foreign influence there were two sentiments shared among the Korea people. Korea could either modernize or go back to the traditional ways of its historic past. Westerners and Japanese had made settlements in Korea; Missionary schools and military outposts respectively, and took full advantage of the fact Korea was in the midst of the twilight of its greatest dynasty, the Chosen. With the West to traveling and settling Asia, western culture and customs spread in turn. As the film's title states, YMCA baseball was a part of this divergence. George Williams founded the YMCA on June 6, 1844, in London, England; YMCA is an acronym for Young Men's Christian Association that began among evangelists. Known for its promotion of sports, it was actually also a missionary organization in conjunction with the Church and run locally and this would most likely have been encouraged even as far away as Korea. Baseball was first introduced in Korea in 1905 by Phillip L. Gillett, a missionary who introduced the sport to members of a YMCA in Seoul. Western missionaries of the YMCA colluded with the Japanese to abolish traditional Korean values and indoctrinate Korean youths to Japanese values and customs. This led many Koreans to study in Tokyo and this is represented by a few characters in the film. Indoctrination of the youth would steer Korea in the direction of modernization; Japan had been undergoing a surge of industrial production and western adoption and the West had already gone through several phases of industrialization. By subverting the youth of Korea to fall in line with more modern and foreign sentiments, in a way ensured the future relations with Korea and the inevitable outcome of this is a struggle between traditional Korean culture and values, and that of new influence. The remark about the Japanese first encountering baseball some thirty years earlier however, was accurate (1872).\nHistorical references.\nThe Japanese general bears a striking resemblance to the last Resident-general of Korea, and later Governor-general, Terauchi Masatake.\nIn the Film, there is a funeral service for a close relative of Jung-rim, who was supposed to be related to the late, Queen Min. The relative had committed suicide in protest to the Eulsa Treaty, this is supposed to be Min Yonghwan (1861–1905), the military attache of King Kojong."

The team was relegated in that championship, but won the División Intermedia in the following year again; after two years in the first level, Lawn Tennis broke away from the Peruvian Football Federation.\nThe team returned to football in 1983, playing in the Segunda División, where it finished in last; the team returned to the Segunda División in 1986, and continued disputing that championship until it was relegated in 1991; However, after the relegation, Meteor merged with it, allowing it to continue participating in the Segunda División; the fusion stood until 1994, when Meteor broke away, and at the same time, Lawn Tennis' football section also split from the main club. The club was champion of the 1997 Segunda División Peruana, attaining promotion to the Torneo Descentralizado, where it remained for only one season before being relegated.\nThe team eventually was relegated from the Segunda División in 2002, returning to the Jesús María district league, where it has remained ever since."

Taylor Director of Public Works. The plan however was potentially jeopardised because some of the area was originally farmland and one owner refused to sell his property to the course. Undaunted, construction finally got under way in earnest on 1 December 1967, and the project was renamed Port Royal Golf Course.\nThe course was the creation of golf course architect, Robert Trent Jones. Design had to be changed several times initially due to land agreements, however this rerouting lead to the creation of the world famous, and much photographed, spectacular 16th hole - the tee and green of which perch precariously on cliffs overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.\nThe course was finally completed and opened in 1970. More recently, it underwent renovation in preparation for the hosting of the 2009 PGA Grand Slam of Golf. A member of the original design team, Roger Rulewich, has headed up this $14.5 million project and the course was officially reopened on 21 July 2009."

The 74th edition of the tournament began on March 13, 2012, and concluded with the championship game on April 2, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans.\nThe Final Four consisted of Kentucky, making their second appearance in the Final Four under John Calipari, Louisville, making their second appearance under Rick Pitino and first since 2005, Kansas, making their first appearance since winning the 2008 national championship under head coach Bill Self by defeating Calipari's Memphis team, and Ohio State, making their first appearance since their runner-up finish in 2007 and second under coach Thad Matta. This was the first (and only) tournament that both national semifinals and the national championship game were regular season rematches. Kentucky defeated Kansas in the championship game 67-59 to win their first national championship since Tubby Smith led the team there in 1998. This was Calipari's first national championship in four trips to the Final Four, having previously gone there with Kentucky in 2011, Memphis in 2008 and Massachusetts in 1996.\nUpsets were once again the story of the tournament in 2012, and for the first time ever two #15 seeds won in the same tournament. In the South Region, #15 Lehigh of the Patriot League defeated #2 Duke. In the West Region, #15 Norfolk State of the MEAC, making their first ever NCAA tournament appearance, defeated #2 Missouri as a 21.5 point underdog, the second biggest upset in terms of point spread in NCAA tournament history, behind Fairleigh Dickinson's defeat of Purdue in 2023, where Purdue was a 23.5 point favorite.\nIn addition to this, Ohio won a game as a double digit seed for the second time in four tournaments as the #13 seed Bobcats defeated #4 seed Michigan to advance to the third round of the Midwest Region. A team from the First Four games also won in the Round of 64 for the second consecutive year as South Florida defeated Midwest #5 seed Temple, setting up a #12 vs. #13 matchup that Ohio won.\nVirginia Commonwealth, a Final Four team from 2011 as an #11 seed, made the 2012 tournament as a #12 seed and once again made the round of 32 by defeating South #5 seed Wichita State. The South Region saw four double digit seeds win in their opening games, as Colorado and Xavier joined VCU and Lehigh as victors. Xavier advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they were defeated by Baylor.\nDespite the upsets, all four top seeds advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time since 2009. Three made it to the Elite Eight, as only Michigan State of the West Region lost. Kentucky was the only one to advance to the Final Four as Syracuse and North Carolina lost in their regional finals. This would end up being the last Final Four until 2019 that did not include at least one team seeded #7 or higher, and still is the last Final Four to not include at least one team seeded #5 or higher as of the conclusion of the 2024 season.\nTwo teams made their first NCAA tournament appearances in school history: MEAC champion Norfolk State and Summit League champion South Dakota State. Ivy League champion Harvard made its first appearance since 1946, ending the longest tournament drought in NCAA history.\nAll four teams from the state of Ohio (Cincinnati, Ohio, Ohio State, and Xavier) made it to the Sweet 16, marking the first time in tournament history any state has been represented by four teams in the round of 16.

He was the winning pitcher in the Expos' first-ever game in franchise history against the Mets at Shea Stadium in New York City in April 1969.\nEarly career.\nA left hander listed as tall and , Shaw was born in Pittsburgh but graduated from Grover Cleveland High School in Reseda, California, in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley. He attended San Diego State University on a baseball scholarship and was selected by the Mets in the 35th round in the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. After two seasons in New York's farm system, Shaw made the 1967 Mets' roster out of spring training and spent his entire rookie campaign with them, working in 40 games, all in relief, and posting a 4–5 record and three saves, with a 2.98 earned run average.\nWon Expos' first-ever game.\nShaw spent most of with Triple-A Jacksonville. The Mets exposed him to the expansion draft, and Montreal chose him with their 21st selection, 40th overall.\nAfter making the Expos' maiden roster, he entered the first National League game in their history on Opening Day, April 8, 1969, in the sixth inning with the score tied, 6–6. He hurled three hitless innings, walking two, as Montreal surged in front, 11–6, aided by home runs from Rusty Staub and Coco Laboy. Shaw struggled in the ninth inning, allowing a walk and three hits, including a three-run, pinch-hit home run by Duffy Dyer, but he departed with Montreal still ahead 11–10. Carroll Sembera, who relieved him, put the tying and winning runs on base before nailing down the save. With Shaw making 35 appearances, the 1969 Expos would go on to lose 110 games in and finish last in their division; the \"Miracle Mets\" would stun baseball by winning the National League pennant and 1969 World Series.\n1971 campaign.\nShaw started the 1970 season in Triple-A, and his contract was sold to the Cardinals in mid-May; he got into only 14 games all year due to a broken hand and didn't return to MLB until April 1971, when he was recalled from Tulsa and added to the St. Louis bullpen corps. Shaw responded with ten consecutive scoreless relief appearances, not allowing a run between April 29 and June 2, and picking up two wins and a save. Shaw finished with a 2.65 earned run average and a 7–2 won–lost mark.\nHowever, a sore shoulder hampered him in ; he worked in only three full innings in eight early-season games before the Cardinals sold his contract to the Oakland Athletics. After making three appearances, Oakland sent him to Triple-A Iowa. He played in the high minors through 1973 and then retired from professional baseball.\nIn his 138 MLB games, Shaw compiled a 13–14 record and a career 4.01 earned run average, with six career saves. He made one career start. In 188 innings pitched, he allowed 166 hits and struck out 123 batters. But he also allowed 101 bases on balls."

        "title": "Cliff Jones (rugby union)",
        "text": "Clifford 'Cliff' William Jones OBE (12 March 1914 – 27 November 1990) was a Welsh international rugby union fly-half who played club rugby for many teams but is most associated with Cardiff and Cambridge University. Jones was known as a quick and elusive runner, but was also noted for his numerous injuries which limited his international and club appearances.\nClub career.\nJones was a product of the Welsh Secondary Schools Rugby Union system, playing competitive matches while still a schoolboy. Educated at Porth Secondary School, and although wanting to play association football was forced towards rugby union as a schoolboy through the sporting curriculum of Llandovery College. Jones gained his first cap as part of the Welsh secondary schools team and came to the attention of the rugby world in a brilliant display in April 1932 in a Secondary Schools game against Yorkshire Schools. During the 1932/33 season Jones was given the captaincy of Llandovery.\nBefore his eighteenth birthday Jones was already playing for Pontypridd and Cardiff, but after leaving Llandovery he was accepted into Cambridge and was selected for the university's rugby team. While there he teamed up with Wilf Wooller, though they both found themselves on the same losing side during the 1933 Varsity match.\nJones managed only 22 appearances for Cardiff, mainly due to injuries sustained on the pitch. He suffered four broken bones before he reached the age of twenty, missed much of the 1936/37 season with a broken collar bone and injured his elbow on a comeback game in 1939.\nInternational rugby career.\nJones was first capped for Wales in 1934, while still at Cambridge, at Cardiff Arms Park against England. The team is recognised as a mess, with 13 of the players being new caps resulting in an unbalanced pack with slow service. Jones was battered by England's Fry and Hordern which left him in tears during the game. Wales lost the game 9-0 and 5 of the new caps were never selected again, though Jones was not amongst them, returning for the next two games of the tournament against Scotland and Ireland; both saw Welsh wins. Jones returned to the Welsh squad the next year in the 1935 Home Nations Championship, and in the second game of the tournament against Scotland he scored his first International try.\n1935 saw the touring New Zealand team arrive in Wales and Jones was selected for Wales to face them. Jones was a controversial choice as his inclusion split the half back unit of Haydn Tanner and Willie Davies who had been key in Swansea's victory over the All Blacks three months previous. In a tight game, which saw Wales's Don Tarr leave the field with a broken neck, Jones finished on the winning team as the All Blacks lost 12-13. In 1936 Jones played in all three games of the Home Nations Championship which saw Wales raise the trophy, scoring his second and final international try, again against Scotland. He missed the 1937 tournament as he was suffering from a broken collar bone.\nIn 1938 Jones was selected to captain Wales for all three Championship games. The first game was against England in which Wales and Jones in particular were impressive in a 14-8 win. Wales may well have taken the title, after also beating Ireland, but were denied a win when Scotland were awarded a penalty two minutes before time when an unconscious Welsh player was deemed to be lying purposefully on the ball. Scotland successfully converted the penalty to win 8-6. Jones finished his Wales career captaining his team and narrowly missing the Grand Slam.\nInternational matches played for Wales.\nWales\nLater life.\nJones remained in rugby after he retired from playing. He became a national selector and was central in devising coaching policies for the Welsh Rugby Union as Chairman of the WRU Coaching Sub-Committee. In the 1980-1981 season, Jones became President of the WRU in their centenary year.\nJones was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1979 New Year Honours \"for services to rugby football in Wales\", and in 1991 was inducted into the Welsh Sports Hall of Fame. He died on 27 November 1990."

        "title": "2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2012-13 season. The 75th annual edition of the tournament (dating to 1939) began on March 19, 2013, and concluded with the championship game on April 8, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.\nThe Final Four consisted of Louisville, Wichita State (second appearance), Syracuse (first appearance since their 2003 national championship), and Michigan, returning for the first time since the Fab Five's second appearance in 1993 (later vacated). By winning the West Region, Wichita State became the first #9 seed and first Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) team to reach the Final Four since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The last #9 seed to reach the Final Four was Penn, and the last MVC team to do so was Indiana State, both in 1979. Louisville defeated Michigan in the championship game by a final score of 82–76, winning their first national title since 1986. On February 20, 2018, the NCAA vacated Louisville's entire tournament run, including its national title, due to a 2015 sex scandal.\nThe tournament featured several notable upsets. For the first time since 1991, at least one team seeded #9 through #15 won at least once in the tournament. The most notable was Florida Gulf Coast University of the Atlantic Sun Conference, who made their tournament debut in only their second year of Division I eligibility. They upset Georgetown and San Diego State in their first two games, becoming the first #15 seed to advance to the regional semifinals (where they were defeated by Florida). For the first time since 2010, a #14 seed won as Harvard defeated New Mexico in the West Region. The same region saw #13 La Salle, who won in the opening round, defeat #4 Kansas State and #12 Mississippi defeat #5 Wisconsin. In addition to that, the region's top seed, Gonzaga, was defeated in the round of 32 by eventual region winner Wichita State, who defeated La Salle in the Sweet Sixteen.\nTwo other teams also earned their first ever NCAA Tournament victory: Ivy League champion Harvard and Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC) champion North Carolina A&amp;T. Another school, Liberty, won the Big South tournament to become the second 20-loss team to make the field, after Coppin State did that in 2008.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 68 teams entered the 2013 tournament. A total of 32 automatic bids are awarded to each program that won a conference tournament. The remaining 36 bids are issued \"at-large\", with selections extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. The Selection Committee also seeds the entire field from 1 to 68.\nEight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the main tournament bracket.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites selected to host each round of the 2013 tournament:\nFirst Four\nFirst and Second rounds\nRegional semifinals and Finals\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nAtlanta hosted the Final Four for the sixth time, having previously hosted in 2007. As of 2024, this is the most recent Final Four to be held in Atlanta (The 2020 edition, which was to be held in Atlanta, was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic).\nQualified teams.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2013 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nTournament seeds.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBracket.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern \"Daylight\" Time ()\"\nFirst Four – Dayton, Ohio.\nThe First Four games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.\nMidwest Regional – Indianapolis, Indiana.\nMidwest Regional all-tournament team.\nRegional all-tournament team: Seth Curry, Duke; Gorgui Dieng, Louisville; Mason Plumlee, Duke; Peyton Siva, Louisville\nRegional most outstanding player: Russ Smith, Louisville\nWest Regional – Los Angeles, California.\nWest Regional all-tournament team.\nRegional all-tournament team: Carl Hall, Wichita State; Mark Lyons, Arizona; LaQuinton Ross, Ohio State; Deshaun Thomas, Ohio State\nRegional most outstanding player: Malcolm Armstead, Wichita State\nSouth Regional – Arlington, Texas.\nSouth Regional all-tournament team.\nRegional all-tournament team: Mitch McGary, Michigan; Ben McLemore, Kansas; Mike Rosario, Florida; Nik Stauskas, Michigan\nRegional most outstanding player: Trey Burke, Michigan\nEast Regional – Washington, D.C..\nEast Regional all-tournament team.\nRegional all-tournament team: Vander Blue, Marquette; C. J. Fair, Syracuse; Davante Gardner, Marquette; James Southerland, Syracuse\nRegional most outstanding player: Michael Carter-Williams, Syracuse\nFinal Four – Georgia Dome, Atlanta, Georgia.\nDuring the Final Four round, the champion of the top overall top seed's region was to play against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region, and the champion of the second overall top seed's region was to play against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region. Louisville (placed in the Midwest Regional) was selected as the top overall seed, and Gonzaga (in the West Regional) was named as the final top seed. Thus, the Midwest champion played the West Champion in one semifinal game, and the South Champion faced the East Champion in the other semifinal game.\nWichita State surprised the college basketball world by reaching the Final Four from the West region. They lost to Louisville in the first semifinal game, 72–68. Michigan defeated Syracuse 61–56 in the second semifinal.\nFinal Four all-tournament team.\nFinal Four all-tournament team: Spike Albrecht, Michigan; Trey Burke, Michigan; Mitch McGary, Michigan; Cleanthony Early, Wichita State; Peyton Siva, Louisville; Luke Hancock, Louisville; Chane Behanan, Louisville;\nFinal Four most outstanding player: Luke Hancock, Louisville (the first non-starter to earn this title) \nGame summaries.\nNational Championship.\nLouisville defeated Michigan 82–76 in the championship game. The win gave Louisville its first championship since 1986, and third overall. It became the eighth school to win at least three championships until vacated by the NCAA on February 20, 2018, due to a 2015 sex scandal.\nHead coach Rick Pitino became the first coach to win an NCAA championship with two different schools. Michigan fell to 1–5 all time in championship games (including two losses vacated because of sanctions against the university).\nMichigan's Trey Burke scored seven quick points to get Michigan out to a 7–3 lead, but also picked up two quick fouls and sat during much of the first half. With Burke on the bench, Michigan got a spark from freshman Spike Albrecht, a minor role player during the regular season. Albrecht hit four straight 3-pointers en route to a 17-point first half performance, easily surpassing his previous single game best of 7. Louisville trailed Michigan 35–23 late in the first half, before going on a run fueled by four straight three-pointers by Luke Hancock. At halftime, Michigan led 38–37.\nThe second half featured several lead changes before Louisville pushed the margin to 10 on a three-pointer by Hancock with 3:20 remaining in the game. Michigan fought back, closing the gap to four points in the last minute, but ran out of time in its comeback effort.\nHancock hit all five three-point shots he attempted in the game and led Louisville with 22 points, while teammate Peyton Siva scored 18 and had a game high 4 steals. Chane Behanan pulled down 12 rebounds to go with 15 points. Burke led Michigan with 24 points. Russ Smith, Louisville's leading scorer on the season, struggled in the game, shooting 3-for-16. Hancock was named as the game's most outstanding player.\nOther events surrounding the tournament.\nOn May 10, 2012, the NCAA announced that as part of the celebration of the 75th Division I tournament, it would hold all three of its men's basketball championship games in Atlanta. The finals of the Division II and Division III tournaments were held at Philips Arena on April 7, the day between the Division I semifinals and final. In addition, Atlanta-based tournament broadcaster TBS announced that Conan O'Brien would tape his \"Conan\" talk show at The Tabernacle, located a few blocks from the Georgia Dome and Philips Arena, in the week leading up to the Final Four. March Madness studio analyst Charles Barkley and Dick Vitale were among the guests who appeared.\nMedia.\nU.S. television.\nThe year 2013 marked the third year of a 14-year partnership between CBS and Turner cable networks TBS, TNT and truTV to cover the entire tournament under the \"NCAA March Madness\" banner. CBS aired the Final Four and championship rounds for the 32nd consecutive year. The tournament was considered a ratings success. Tournament games averaged 10.7 million viewers, and the championship game garnered an average of 23.4 million viewers and a peak viewership of 27.1 million.\nRadio.\nDial Global Sports (formerly Westwood One) and SiriusXM have live broadcasts of all 67 games.\nInternational.\nESPN International held broadcast rights to the tournament outside of the United States: it produced its own broadcasts of the semi-final and championship game, called by \"ESPN College Basketball\" personalities Brad Nessler (play-by-play), Dick Vitale (analyst for the final and one semi-final), and Jay Bilas (analyst for the other semi-final). For the initial rounds, they use CBS/Turner coverage with an additional host to transition between games, with whiparound coverage similar to the CBS-only era. ESPN also has exclusive digital rights to the NCAA tournament outside of North America.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the TSN family of media outlets (including TSN2, RDS, and TSN Radio), which are part-owned by ESPN, own broadcast rights to the tournament. TSN produces separate studio coverage with Kate Beirness, Jack Armstrong, Dan Shulman and Sam Mitchell, but simulcasts CBS/Turner game coverage for the first five rounds (and ESPN International coverage for the Final Four).\nAs in past years, TSN and TSN2 carry whiparound coverage (often in parallel) during the second, third and fourth rounds, in 2013 focusing when possible on games not being broadcast on CBS (as that network, but not the Turner channels, is also widely available in Canada)."

        "text": "The All-Ireland Rugby League Championship was first played for in 1997 under the title All-Ireland Challenge Cup. Since then it has also been known as the All-Ireland League, Elite League and the All-Ireland Championship. It is a rugby league competition involving teams from Ireland.\nAt one point it was called the McGettigans All-Ireland League for sponsorship reasons)\nHistory.\nThe first domestic rugby league club in Ireland were the Dublin Blues. They were a club founded in 1989 by \"Brian Corrigan\" \nFollowing the formation of the Ireland national side in 1995 a league competition was mooted to aid further development. So in 1997 the first Rugby League tournament began in Ireland. Under the title \"All-Ireland Challenge Cup\" eight clubs, Belfast Buccaneers , Tallaght Tigers , Churchtown Warriors , East Coast Panthers from Bray, Bangor Vikings , Dublin Blues , Northside Saints and Cork Bulls chased the first ever title. Fittingly the oldest club \"Dublin Blues\" lifted the trophy.\n\"Northside Saints\" from Dublin won the following season before \"Dublin Blues\" won the title for the second and so far last time. 2000 brought victory for another \"Dublin\" club in \"Churchtown Warriors\" before Cork Bulls briefly ended the Dubliners dominance. Dublin City Exiles won the first of two consecutive titles, both against \"Dublin Blues\" in 2002.\nClontarf Bulls were a surprise winner in 2004, the next campaign saw the emergence of Treaty City Titans from Limerick as a truly dominant force they would go on and win six of the next seven championships, many of which saw them go undefeated. In the season they didn't win they were runner-up to Carlow Crusaders in 2008 a side they had beaten in the previous three finals.\nDuring this time as the sport grew the league changed from regional leagues \"Leinster\" and \"Munster\" into a top division \"Elite League\" underpinned by local leagues.\nBy 2010 regional leagues were brought back followed by a series of play-offs. On the field Country Cowboys won their first title in 2012, it was back to the norm in 2013 as Treaty City Titans lifted their 7th title.\nThe \"Titans\" had to settle for runners-up the next season as Barnhall Butchers won for the first time. Treaty City Titans after an indifferent campaign won again in 2015 and in 2016 we were guaranteed a new name on the trophy as debutant finalists Galway Tribesmen overcame 2012 runners-up Ballynahinch Rabbitohs\nCurrent clubs 2023 \nWomen's competition.\nWinners:"

        "text": "Thomas Edwin Holliday (13 July 1898 – 19 July 1969), also known as \"Tom\" or \"Tosh\", was an English rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s. He was a dual-code international, playing for the England national rugby union team, British Lions, and the England national rugby league team.\nBiography.\nThomas Edwin Holliday, born 13 July 1898 in Wigton, the youngest of four brothers, two of which died in the Great War, came from a long line of Cumberland sporting personalities. He began his education at the local school before winning a scholarship to attend The Nelson Thomlinson School, Wigton. After the armistice he began playing rugby for his home town club, Aspatria RUFC. He received the first of his 36 Cumberland county caps playing against Cheshire in 1920. In 1921, he played fullback for the North in their annual game against the South. In 1923, he received the first of his seven international caps, playing against Scotland and France. In the same year he captained Aspatria when they defeated Silloth RFC to regain the Cumberland county cup. In 1924, he went on the British Lions' tour to South Africa but suffered a broken collar bone in the opening game and took no further part in the series. In 1925, he played in three of the four international matches, taking the field against Ireland, France and Scotland. In 1925, he played against France and Scotland. In 1924, he captained Cumberland when they won the County Championship, for the first and only time in their history, defeating Kent by six points to three in the final at Carlisle. He continued to captain the county side until 1926, when he accepted one of many offers to play Rugby league, signing professional forms for Oldham. In 1927, Oldham beat Swinton by 26 points to 7, in the first BBC broadcast Rugby League Challenge Cup final. Tosh scored three tries and became only the third man in the history of the final to achieve that recognition. F. W. (Basher) Ashworth, another native of Aspatria also played in that final. In 1996, Robbie Paul also joined that elite grouping, playing for Bradford Bulls when they defeated St. Helens. Tosh also gained an international cap for England playing against Wales in 1928. He retired from the game in 1931, when he returned to Aspatria to run a shop selling drapery and ironmongery. He died at Aspatria on 19 July 1969.\nThe eldest brother Jonathon (Jont) was a highly respected three-quarter back, won the first of his 32 county caps at the age of seventeen. He was a member of the Aspatria side that won the county cup in 1909, 1911 &amp; 1912, and beaten finalists in 1908 and 1910. Perhaps his greatest achievement came in 1913, when he played in the county side narrowly beaten by Gloucestershire in the final of the county championship. On 18 November 1916, two individual telegrams arrived at the family home, regarding the disappearance of both Jont and his younger brother Alex, reports later substantiated.\nRugby union.\nHolliday played at fullback for Aspatria RUFC. He also captained Cumberland in the English County Championship, against Kent in 1924.\nHe later played for , on 17 March 1923 against at Inverleith. He was capped a further six times between then and 1926.\nThe following year, he went on the 1924 British Lions tour to South Africa, but was injured in the first match, and so was unable to play in the rest of the tour. He was not the only 1924 British Lion to switch to rugby league, Roy Kinnear also did so.\nRugby league.\nAt club level, he played for Oldham.\nHolliday won a cap for England while at Oldham in 1928 against Wales.\nContemporaneous article extract.\n\"T. Holliday' Aspatria, Cumberland and England (Rugby Union.) \"Born in 1899 (sic \"1898\"), T. Holliday has played a great part in the post-war success of Cumberland in the County Championship. A tower of strength to the Aspatria Club, he gained an international cap for England in 1923, and he has since played eight (sic \"seven\") times for England. Primarily he is a full-back, but for his club and for his country he has frequently played with success in the centre (sic \"only as a fullback for England\"), and his sense of position has always stood him in good stead. He is a safe full-back, and although he does not have a kick of great length, he always makes sure of finding touch.\"\"\nNote.\nAlthough Holliday's nicknames were \"Tom\", or \"Tosh\", he is erroneously nicknamed \"Toff\" in some references."

        "title": "K*bot World Championships",
        "text": "K*bots are moving models made from K'Nex Construction kits, built to participate in specific events run by the K*bot World Championships (USA) and K*bots UK (UK). Events are open to children aged 7–16 years and focus on competitive design and engineering challenges. The K*bot World Championships are an annual event in which students from around the World compete to be crowned World Champion across four distinct categories, called divisions, which are explained in detail below.\nK*bots events are currently run in the United States and the United Kingdom. Students come together for an event lasting anywhere from two to five days, during which they are guided through a range of simple engineering concepts in a workshop environment, with all students building one or more K*bots for competitive demonstration on the final day. The K*bot World Championships are the ultimate destination for successful builders, at which students compete against each other in each of the divisions.\nHistory.\nK*bots in America.\nK*bots were invented by Thomas Vermersch, a former science educator from Texas, in the summer of 1998 at the San Antonio Academy during a holiday Science Camp. During a roller-coaster building session one afternoon, two of his students made simple motorised machines from K'Nex parts and placed them opposite each other on the floor, determining that they must try to push each other back to win their match. Mr. Vermersch saw potential with this idea. The following year he held a K*bots competition for the first time, using a development of these rules which saw K*bots running on a tabletop, as a discrete event which is credited as being the start of K*bots.\nIn 1999, K*bots in America became more structured with the crystallisation of competition into Division 1 (two-wheel drive) and Division 2 (four-wheel drive). In 2002, a remote control Division 3 was added to the event roster to make use of Cyber K'Nex units. 2002 also saw the first World Championships, which featured solely American competitors in its inaugural year.\nFrom its initial base competitions in Texas and Nevada, K*bots expanded in 2005–06 to include new regional events in the city of North Las Vegas and two regional competitions in Phoenix, Arizona. The number of events then shifted in 2007, with Texas losing its regional events before Phoenix shut down in 2009. However, there is currently a fresh movement abound to restore K*bot events to states outside of Nevada.\nK*bots in Britain.\nThe first recorded K*bots were built in Britain in early 2001. A group of students, including K*bots UK founding members Toby Wheeler, David Weston and Chris Bowdon, organised the first collective event in April 2002 in Carterton, near Oxford. The first event featured manually operated K*bots only, which would later come to be termed Division M. In 2003, the UK group ran a second event, at which they trialled the American Division 1 format in addition to their own manual-based competition.\nIn 2004 the event formally became part of the K*bot World Championships, and started running all four divisions in more structured events. With interest gaining momentum, in 2006 the UK started running Regional competitions of its own around the South of the country, leading to the first UK Championships in 2007, though in truth these only served as a qualifying round for the World Championships themselves.\nIn 2010, the K*bots In Schools curriculum enrichment programme was launched, allowing pupils to build K*bots for competition during a workshop based at their own school. Successful entries are retained for the annual UK Championships, so that their builders may improve and compete with them during the finals.\nK*bot World Championships.\nBy the Autumn of 2001, regional US K*bots events were running in San Antonio (TX), Corpus Christi (TX), Henderson (NV) and Las Vegas (NV). Mr. Vermersch sought a means to allow regional winners to test their K*bots against those from other events, and devised the K*bot World Championships to allow students from across all regions to come together and compete for trophies in each of Division 1, 2 and 3. The first World Championships were held in July 2002 in Las Vegas, Nevada, at the Veterans Memorial Leisure Services Centre, which has become their permanent home ever since.\nIn 2003, the World Championships returned as a far larger and more prestigious event. Considerable expense went into trophies and prizes for the winning students and it started to attract interest from regional television and press media. The 2003 event also saw Toby Wheeler from the UK group make an appearance for the first time. During the course of the week, it was agreed that UK events would henceforth adopt the same format as K*bot events in America, with a view to becoming an official part of the World Championships in 2004.\nExpansion\n2004 accordingly saw the World Championships expand to feature students from outside America. Britain sent their first representative to the World Championships, and in addition there were students representing Japan, Austria and the Philippines, as well as several states of America itself.\n2004 was also the first year to feature the British-style manual K*bots, re-branded as \"Division M\" (for \"manual\"), raising the number of divisions at the World Championships to four in total. However, it incredibly took until 2008 for a British student to actually win a World Championship in the division conceived on British soil.\nWith enthusiasm for K*bots gathering pace and returning students becoming ever more inventive, the 2005 World Championships saw the emergence of some very advanced models which started, for the first time, to push the limits of what the K'Nex motors were capable of. The Division 1 World Championship Final, widely regarded as the best K*bot match of all time, involved so much pressure on the materials that damage was caused to both the K'Nex pieces and the motors powering the K*bots.\nThis prompted a re-drafting of the rulebook in 2006, to allow technology to advance in a more sustainable fashion. The format has remained largely unchanged since that time, though rules have been tweaked in reaction to new technologies. The K*bot World Championships today remain a proving ground for the best young engineering minds from around the World, and are looking to expand even further over the coming years.\nRules and regulations.\nNote that the following guidelines are only an outline of the rules of K*bots, and are not exhaustive. A full, detailed set of rules and regulations for the K*bot World Championships can be found on the official website, kbotworld.com\nDivision 1 and 2.\n\"Competition regulations\"\nDivision 1 and 2 K*bots are motorised models placed at opposite ends of the competition table and switched on. The aim is to push your opponent's K*bot off the table within a 90-second time limit. If both K*bots remain on the table after 90 seconds, the winner will be the K*bot which has advanced furthest towards or past the centre line on the competition table.\nA K*bot is considered eliminated as soon as any of its wheels are fully off the table. K*bots can also be eliminated if they are flipped completely over during a match, in such a way that they are unable to continue to move independently.\nIf the two K*bots have locked together and are not moving, after 45 seconds the referee can \"tap the table\" by lifting and dropping each end of the competition table in sequence, until the K*bots start moving again.\n\"Build regulations\"\nK*bots can weigh no more than and are limited by their size. In American and World Championship events, the maximum permitted dimensions are length × width × height . In British events, the maximum permitted dimensions are length × width × height .\nK*bots are permitted a maximum of four medium-size K'Nex wheels, with an optional specialty Alliance Rubber band around each of the wheels to enhance grip. The sole difference between the divisions is that Division 1 K*bots have only two-wheel drive; Division 2 K*bots must have four-wheel drive.\nDivision 3.\nDivision 3 has undergone huge changes since its initial introduction into the regulations in 2002. It has appeared in a variety of forms, though always making use of remote-control building kits. The format has historically changed on a two-year basis.\nDivision M.\n\"Competition regulations\"\nDivision M K*bots are manually operated models which compete in a tabletop arena enclosed within plexiglas walls approximately tall. There are strict rules of engagement, the most important being that a K*bot must be pushed and released to initiate movement; a K*bot cannot be moved or turned directly by hand.\nK*bots score points for attacks with an active weapon (e.g. a flipper, hammer or rotary disc) and damage caused to an opponent's K*bot. Operators may also lose \"penalty points\" for infringements of the operation regulations. The K*bot amassing the most points during a 90-second match is adjudged to be the winner. If both K*bots are tied for points after 90 seconds, they will enter a short \"overtime shootout\" in which the first K*bot to score a point is the winner.\nIf a K*bot leaves the tabletop arena at any point during the match, it is automatically eliminated. Indeed, some students have developed \"one-hit-kill\" weapons designed to achieve exactly this.\n\"Build regulations\"\nK*bots must weigh between and and are subject to the same size restrictions as for Division 1 and 2 K*bots (see above). Builders are permitted more creative freedom within this division, since the range of chassis and mobility types are not restricted.\nAll moving mechanisms on a K*bot must be mounted on a pivot, or be as a result of movement around or through a fixed point. This includes active weapons, which are generally considered flipper-type and hammer-type weapons. There is currently no provision for spinning disc-type weapons. Moving mechanisms must be operated by a handle or lever; the shafts cannot be directly operated by hand.\n\"Previous regulations\"\nBefore K*bots in the United Kingdom became an official part of the K*bot World Championships, there were two build categories of manual K*bots. \"Division M1\" was for lightweight K*bots weighing a maximum of , designed to encourage students to build at home if they did not own a lot of K'Nex. \"Division M2\" was a more standard category, with a weight limit of .\nThese split categories survived until early 2004, but with the growth of more structured K*bots events in Britain, they became obsolete when the standard World Championships weight limit was adopted.\nOther categories.\nDuring an event at Marling School of Engineering in February 2010, British students began testing a proposed K*bot Division, run to the same rules as Division 1 or 2 with the sole exception that no wheels were permitted anywhere on the design. Pupils instead had to build entries with tracks, legs or other forms of alternative mobility. The first event was won by a K*bot named Jimbot, but the category has since been deemed unsuitable for younger builders and has therefore been shelved.\nWhile the four K*bot divisions comprise the vast majority of build time during an event, there is often opportunity for special team-based challenges, particularly at events in the United Kingdom. These special challenges focus on a specific design skill, and allow students to work collaboratively to devise the most effective solution.\nPrior examples include wind-powered sail cars, pull-back dragsters, tennis ball launchers and motorised walking racers. One event in America even saw the creation of a vast interactive skyscraper, with moving elevators and other features. Build regulations and success criteria for the challenges are usually set on an \"ad hoc\" basis, though each new challenge sets a precedent for future repeats. The four K*bot divisions are the focal point of the week, but in British events at least, the special challenges are often the most memorable and stimulating activities of the workshop.\nFormat.\nRegional events.\nEach year, a number of Regional events are held in preparation for the World Championships. Regional events are week-long workshops at which students can prepare and test their K*bots for competition. At these events, first-time builders receive extensive support to get them started with their first K*bot. Under guidance from the instructors, first-time students learn basic concepts of physics and mechanical engineering, specific to building an effective moving model out of K'Nex.\nAt the end of each Regional event, a competition is held to determine the most successful builders in each division throughout the week. Winning a Regional event is therefore an indication of a builder's ability, but Regional Champions do not receive the trophies and major prizes which are available for winning a World Championship.\nParticipation at a Regional event is not mandatory for students wishing to take part in the World Championships, but it is highly recommended for a number of reasons. Most importantly, first-time builders receive only limited instruction time at the World Championships, whereas provision is much greater at Regional events. Additionally, students benefit from the extra testing and preparation time during the Regional event; World Champions are almost always veterans of the Regional events, with very few historical exceptions.\nWorld Championships.\nIn 2009, the World Championships underwent landmark changes to make the events more structured, with tweaks made for 2010 to improve the show even more. The contests are run over five days, Monday to Friday, in mid-July.\nDuring the first four days, students have the chance to assess the opposition, and make any changes necessary to their K*bots to give them further competitive advantage. This will be the first opportunity that many students will get to meet other Regional qualifiers.\nAlso during the first four days, K*bots will compete in official Qualifying sessions which count towards a seeding system for the final day's competitions. In these sessions, students are permitted a maximum of six official Qualifying matches (three per session in two sessions during the week), in which they are awarded points for performance. In Division 3 and M, these simply correspond to the number of points accrued during the match. In Division 1 and 2, K*bots are drawn into a ladder system, and builders must challenge opponents above them in order to climb higher. K*bots take the place of those they defeat, with intermediary K*bots each dropping one place in the ladder.\nThe top eight qualifiers in each division are seeded for the final competition. This means that they are kept separate from each other in the early rounds, and cannot meet other seeded K*bots until at least the Third Round. In the event of an uneven number of K*bots being entered into the draw, the top seed(s) will receive a first-round bye.\nThe World Championship Finals in Division M are held on the afternoon of the fourth day, for timing reasons. On the fifth day, the World Championship Finals are held for Division 1 (widely regarded as the most exciting of the four), Division 2 and Division 3. Parents are invited to watch the Finals and support participating students.\nThe draw\nThe World Championship Finals are run as a series of knockout rounds. Divisions are generally open to a maximum of 32 registered entrants (although Division 1 and 2 regularly extend to 40 students), and are run to the following format:-\nIn the event of more than 32 students being registered for a division, the students finishing lowest in the official Qualifying sessions must take part in a Preliminary Round, in which they play each other in a knockout structure, to reduce the total number of students to 32.\nPrevious winners.\nWorld Championship winners.\nDivision 1 World Championships\nDivision 2 World Championships\nDivision 3 World Championships\nDivision M World Championships\nDetails of the 2009 World Championship winners can also be found online at Centennial View\nUK K*bots In Schools winners.\nKey Stage 2 UK Championships\nKey Stage 3 UK Championships\nKey technologies.\nThroughout the history of K*bots, enterprising students have sought creative ways to gain an advantage over their rivals by developing technologies to improve the power or effectiveness of their K*bot. Working with K'Nex in tandem with advanced principles of mechanical engineering, students have exceeded the remit of K'Nex as merely a toy construction kit. Modern K*bots are complex, finely tuned machines. This section details just a few of the innovative strategies employed at the K*bot World Championships.\nGearing strategies.\nParamount to an effective Division 1 or 2 K*bot is the use of K'Nex gears to alter the output of the standard K'Nex motor. By attaching a small gear to the drive shaft and meshing it with a larger gear attached to the wheel axle, the motor's output is slowed down, moving it into a lower torque band and improving the traction (and therefore pushing power) of the K*bot. This process can be repeated multiple times to enhance the K*bot's power still further. In America, this process is termed \"gear reduction\". In Britain, it is termed \"downshifting\".\nIt is also possible to gear the motor the other way, increasing the speed of the motor's output but reducing its overall torque. This strategy is counter-productive in Division 1 or 2, but can be employed to great effect in Division 3 as part of rotating weapons such as rotary axes or spinning discs.\nBrakes.\nBrakes are non-motorised additions to a K*bot which prevent it from being pushed backward. These vary from simple chassis protrusions, designed to snag and dig into the tabletop surface, to more advanced strategies such as slip-gears and backward-mounted friction motors on axles to prevent them from turning backward.\nDue to increasing stresses being placed upon K*bots, all varieties of brakes were outlawed from 2006 onwards in an attempt to protect the K'Nex motors from damage. A welcome side-effect of this ruling has been a shift in focus from defensive strategies to offensive strategies; in the absence of brakes, K*bots has become more a test of pushing power, rather than who can resist a push most effectively.\nFour-wheel drive.\nA basic technology but nevertheless very important, four-wheel drive was introduced on K*bots as early as 1999, at the birth of Division 2. Initially it was installed by way of a bevel gear attached to a shaft protruding from the second output port of the K'Nex motor, meshed with a gear on the front axle. However, when downshifting became commonplace at the World Championships circa 2005, this method become obsolete, since a small gear could not reliably be meshed with a larger gear in a bevelled setup.\nDivision 2 K*bots therefore evolved to have a drive train comprising a series of meshed gears, linking the front and rear wheel axles. This is now accepted as the only feasible method to achieve success in modern-day Division 2.\nVariable transmission.\nTaking gearing strategies to the extent of its logical progression, in 2008 David Small, from Phoenix, Arizona, created the first (and to date, the only) K*bot with a variable transmission system. The K*bot started a match with the motor running in high-speed, low-torque mode. However, when it came into contact with another K*bot, it triggered a mechanism which shifted the transmission to engage with a different drive train, which was low-speed and high-torque.\nThis allowed the K*bot to reach the centre-line of the competition table before its opponent, and then engage high-torque mode to prevent it from being pushed backward at too great a rate. The efficiency of this system was remarkable, and it won David the 2008 Division 2 World Championship.\nOutlawed\nHowever, an objection was raised in August 2008 on the grounds that the introduction of such a complex system into the field would result in such dramatic potential changes to the Division 2 build philosophy that it would prevent many students from producing successful K*bots. The length of time necessary to learn, understand and effect this system would exclude all but the long-term veterans from being able to build such a device on their own K*bots, and would create a two-tier system at the World Championships; the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots\".\nTo stave off this potentially damaging state of affairs, variable transmission was accordingly banned from 2009 onwards. It remains, therefore, an exceptional technological achievement – but one that will never be repeated at the World Championships.\nActive chassis.\nThe pioneer of this technique was Edy Valdes from Texas, who installed an active chassis on his K*bot \"Greem Reaper\" to win two World Championships in Division 1, in 2002 and 2005. Its effectiveness is based on the twin premises that a K*bot requires pressure over its rear wheels to generate grip, and that, with the right technology, the pushing power of an opposing K*bot can be absorbed and used against it.\nActive chassis, more commonly termed \"flexi-fronts\", are non-rigid constructions designed to arch up on contact with an opposing pushing force, creating elastic potential energy, and channelling the resulting pressure into the K*bot's rear wheels.\nThis phenomenon can be highlighted by using the human body as an example. If you are trying to push a heavy object, doing so with arms fully outstretched is seldom effective. However, if you bend your arms slightly and tense your muscles, it allows you to push against much greater resistance. K*bots work in exactly the same way.\nMulti-pivot flippers.\nMoving into the field of Division M; there are two key types of weapon – flippers and hammers – and both have been subject to significant upgrades since their initial inception. Multi-pivot flippers have been around in Britain since K*bots first began, but did not appear in America until 2005, after students had been exposed to them at the 2004 World Championships.\nA conventional flipper is manipulated by simply pushing down on one side of a to generate opposing (upward) movement on the other side. A flipper built with multiple sets of pivots, however, is designed to multiply the force used and distance travelled by the input lever, which results in a significantly more powerful output from the weapon shaft. These flippers are designed to be capable of throwing a 650g K*bot several feet across the competition table, and possibly even clearing the arena walls to win by knockout.\nTurret hammers.\nAs if in response to the rising dominance of the flippers, Turret Hammers made a brief appearance at the 2005 World Championships, before positively exploding in number in 2007. In a single year, the multi-pivot flippers were eclipsed by the sheer effectiveness of these new hammer weapons, and they began to pervade the field.\nA conventional hammer can only be fired in one direction; namely, whichever direction the K*bot happens to be facing, since adjusting the K*bot's position before firing a weapon is strictly prohibited. However, turret hammers exploit a loophole in the rules which allows users to adjust the positioning of their \"weaponry\" before firing. Turret hammers are therefore built on a fully rotating platform atop the K*bot, allowing them to be rotated to face an opponent before the hammer is fired, virtually guaranteeing a hit (and therefore a point) every time an opponent's K*bot comes within striking range.\nK*bot Ollie Awards.\nIn 2005, the popular Oliver Serrao, a K*bots student and Division 3 World Champion, tragically lost his life along with his parents in a fire at their home in Texas. This tragedy saddened the K*bots fraternity, as Oliver was not only a likeable young man but also had star potential. In commemoration of his name, the K*bot Ollie Awards were set up to every year honour outstanding K*bots students from the prior year's competition. Each year at the World Championships, the Ollie Awards ceremony is held and trophies are presented to the winners in each category, voted on by the K*bot students and others associated with the World Championships.\nAwards categories.\nEach year, six trophies are given out as the K*bot fraternity honours its top students. These categories are:\nPro Challenge.\nEvery year, a popular feature of the Ollie Awards ceremony is the Pro Challenge, in which the World Championships instructors all build their own K*bots to compete against each other for a special prize. Since the instructors are able to draw on vast amounts of K*bot building knowledge and are not restrained by the strict letter of the rules for this one-off special event, these Pro Challenge K*bots tend to be amongst the most powerful creations in existence, and matches are always well received by the students and parents who attend the ceremony. There have been four Pro Challenge tournaments to date, with American instructors winning three times and British instructors winning once.\nK*bot Hall of Fame.\nWhen a K*bot reaches the end of its useful life, the chassis is generally taken apart so that the parts can be recycled. However, if a K*bot has been particularly successful or noteworthy for some reason, it is preserved and retained in the K*bot Hall of Fame, which is displayed every year at the World Championships to provide inspiration for current students. The K*bots inducted into the Hall of Fame so far are:\nGodzilla (Division 2)\nBuilt in 1999, this was the first superstar K*bot. Its unbeaten run in regional events which saw it win five regional championships in five years is unlikely ever to be rivalled. Peculiarly, however, Godzilla never delivered on its potential at the World Championships, with its best result being to reach the Grand Final in 2002. Unfortunately, as one of the earliest K*bots to be built before proper documentation of students was effected, the identity of Godzilla's builder is unknown.\nGreem Reaper (Division 1)\nWhile it was competing in 2002–2005, this K*bot was the best in the world. It was years ahead of its time in terms of technology and pushing power. Greem Reaper cruised to the 2002 Division 1 World Championship, but was narrowly defeated in 2003 and was then eliminated in the opening round in 2004, to the surprise of everyone involved in the competition. This prompted some upgrades by builder Edy Valdes, and Greem Reaper then returned to win the 2005 World Championship, before retiring the following year.\nWrath (Division 3)\nA special K*bot in the hearts of many, this was the creation of Oliver Serrao, after whom the K*bot Ollie Awards are named. It won the 2004 Division 3 World Championship, and when Serrao died in a fire the following year, its operation was taken over by his friend Edy Valdes, who took it to repeat World Championship success in 2005. Valdes dedicated his victory to Serrao posthumously and the K*bot Wrath was retired, becoming the first K*bot in history to go unbeaten at the World Championships.\nProject X (Division M)\nThough its list of accolades seems short compared to other K*bots in the Hall of Fame, Project X is nevertheless a notable addition as it was the first UK K*bot to win an event in Britain. It is also the blueprint design for the vast majority of contemporary multi-pivot flippers, almost all of which are based on Toby Wheeler's original design. Project X never competed at a World Championships, since its builder was too old at the time it was built.\nCrosshair (Division 2)\nThis made history as the first K*bot built outside the United States to win a K*bot World Championship, when Andrew Martin took the Division 2 crown in 2004. It is also one of the longest-serving K*bots in history, having competed at no less than six World Championships, reaching at least the semi-final stage on four occasions. Crosshair also won two Regional events and a UK Championship, before being retired in 2009.\nC4 (Division M)\nDesigned by Chace Younger from California, C4 was built in reaction to the multi-pivot flippers introduced in the 2004 World Championship, and featured an innovative new take on the design. Younger fitted hammers to the arm of his flipper, which automatically fired whenever the flipper was activated. This meant that, if the flipper failed to overturn an opponent, the hammers would strike and salvage a point. This perfect weapon synergy won C4 back-to-back World Championships in 2005 and 2006. It was retired, unbeaten, when Younger became too old to compete.\nTank (Division 2)\nMost famous as the K*bot who repeatedly denied the mighty Godzilla from winning a World Championship, Kyle Young's K*bot won titles in 2002 and 2003, knocking Godzilla out of the competition on both occasions. It was the first to make genuinely effective use of gearing strategies to enhance its pushing power and, though unspectacular, it has always been a solid opponent.\nMan Eater (Division 2)\nYet another Division 2 K*bot to achieve fame, Man Eater was the creation of Devyn Bowden from Corpus Christi, Texas. In its four years of competition, Man Eater achieved the incredible feat of winning three successive K*bot World Championships, dominating the division from 2005 to 2007. During this time, it also achieved notoriety in Britain as the nemesis of Crosshair, denying Andrew Martin the title on two successive occasions by knocking him out of the competition."

        "title": "India men's national volleyball team",
        "text": "The India men's national volleyball team represents India in international volleyball competitions. It is managed by the Volleyball Federation of India and is currently sponsored by Sahara India Pariwar and Asics.\nThe Indian volleyball team has had a rollercoaster ride in its history. Although they have never qualified for the Olympics, they have appeared in the World Championship twice.\nDespite having little to no presence at the world stage in its history, the team has enjoyed some success at the continental level by clinching a silver medal and two bronze medals at the Asian Games. After the decline post 1980s, the team has fared well at the recently introduced Asian Cup competition, receiving a silver and a bronze medal so far. \nHistory.\nPre-Independence.\nThough the game was played informally for a long time, the first interstate volleyball tournament was held in 1936 by the Indian Olympic Association (IOA).\nEstablishment.\nIn 1951, the formation of Volleyball Federation of India gave the sport a better structure and the interstate tournament evolved into the senior national championship with the first edition being held in 1952. This platform gave birth to many talents who went on to represent India at the international level.\nGolden years (1952–1962).\nIndia had immediate success after formation as they made their debut in FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship's 1952 edition. After losing to France and Czechoslovakia by comfortable 3–0 margins in the first round, they made a comeback in the 7th–8th placing round as they beat Finland, Lebanon and Israel to clinch the 8th spot.\nIn 1955, India won the Asian Volleyball Tournament which was held in Tokyo. Three years later, the Gurudev Singh led team won the bronze medal at the 1958 Asian Games. They beat Hong Kong and the Philippines in three straight sets but could not get past volleyball powerhouses Iran and Japan, though they managed to win a set against each.\nIn the 1962 Asian Games they managed to go one step ahead as they began their campaign with four consecutive wins against Burma(twice), Cambodia and Pakistan. Their old rivals Japan got the better of them in what was a five set thriller, with Japan winning the final set by 15–12 margin. This team was led by legendary players Nripjit Singh Bedi and A. Palaniswamy, both Arjuna Award winners, who had graduated to the senior team, which was then led by TP Padmanabhan Nair, who was also a part of the 1958 team. India has to settle for the Silver Medal which is currently their highest achievement ever at the Asian Games.\nThe finest era (1960s–1980s).\nAfter a memorable outing at the 1962 Asian Games, India finished fourth and fifth at the 1966 and 1974 Asian Games respectively, not making it to the 1970 edition in between.\nIndia did not enter into the inaugural Asian men's volleyball championship in 1975 but made their debut in the following tournament in 1979 where they finished fifth. In the 1978 Asian Games in Bangkok and at the 1982 Asian Games at home in New Delhi, the Indian volleyball team saw another upswing after finishing seventh and fourth respectively, falling just short of a medal in 1982 edition after they finished at the bottom of the table among four teams in the final round, going down to the heavyweights South Korea and China in straight sets.\nIn the following year at the Asian Volleyball Championship in Tokyo, India finished fifth yet again without any medal. However, the wait for a medal would not last too long.\nIn the 1986 Asian Games India sent arguably its best team ever. Led by Cyril Valloor, the team boasted the presence of former national coach GE Sridharan, K Udayakumar, who later went on to captain the Indian volleyball team, Abdul Basith, Dalel Singh and PV Ramana, father of Indian badminton star PV Sindhu.\nAll of them were Arjuna awardees but the most special of them all and the team's lynchpin was the talented Jimmy George, an Arjuna winner himself and a legend of Indian volleyball. He had been tearing up the national circuit for a decade and also had stints at clubs in Italy, one of the best leagues in that era, along with GE Sridharan.\nJimmy George towered at a height of 6'2\" and had the advantage of graceful jumps. His ability in the air for a fraction of a second longer helped him in his smashes, all of which were very powerful thanks to his larger frame.\nAll of these factors combined well together and the Indian volleyball team started the Asian Games with four victories – against Hong Kong, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.\nLater in the games, they went down to the home team South Korea, who went on to register another victory later, but in between the Indian volleyball team finally managed to beat powerhouses Japan, more impressively in straight sets, facilitated by Jimmy George's tremendous drive. However, they could not sustain the momentum, as they fell to eventual champions China, to end up with bronze medal.\nDecline (1990s–2000s).\nThe general popularity of the sport in the country declined in the years to follow as in-fighting within federations coincided with the death of Jimmy George in an accident in 1987 and adding to it was the rise of the Indian national cricket team as a powerhouse.\nThe Indian volleyball men and women's teams dominated the South Asian Federation Games in the nineties, winning three medals each, but it did not spark a revival, with subpar performances to follow at the 2006 and 2010 by the men after they came at ninth and sixth respectively.\nHowever, they finished fourth in the 2005 Asian Men's Volleyball Championship which is currently their highest ever finish at this tournament. They went all the way to semi-finals where they lost in straight sets against Japan and then went down to South Korea in third place match losing with a margin of three sets to one.\n2010–present.\nThe 2010 and 2014 editions of the Asian Games provided some respite as the Indian volleyball men's team finished a respectable fifth with modern-day stars and inspirational captains Sinnadu Prabhagaran and Mohan Ukkrapandian leading the way.\nThe team also played at the Asian Cup, where they achieved some fine results, capturing bronze medal at the 2010 Asian Cup and reached all the way to the final of the 2014 Asian Cup by defeating Japan in the group stage, the top Asian team Iran in the semi-final before succumbing to South Korea with a margin of three sets to one. Besides couple of good performances at the Asian level, the team also managed to claim a gold medal at the 2010 South Asian Games.\nThe Indian volleyball men's team was ranked 34th in 2014, their best in the world, they also managed to win a gold medal eighth gold medal at 2016 South Asian Games, but just as it seemed that the sport was picking up again, an internal dispute in the VFI meant that it was banned from the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) for two years till 2018.\nIt meant that Indian volleyball players could not travel to other leagues to play, which affected the exposure to different styles, a factor which coach GE Sridharan felt led to a 12th-place finish at the 2018 Asian Games.\nHowever, things are looking up again. The Pro Volleyball League, a franchise-based tournament was started in 2019 and it was a resounding success, made more memorable by the appearance of stars like American David Lee, an Olympic gold medallist in 2008. India also gained their ninth and seventh successive gold medal at the South Asian Games in 2019.\nThough the men's Indian volleyball team won't be in Tokyo following their loss in the Olympic qualification tournament, with the renewed interest in the sport thanks to the new franchise league, the nation could see the upswing in the next few years.\nNotable players and past squads.\n1958 Asian Games squad.\nT.

Kurup was appointed in 1982 ahead of 1982 Asian Games in Delhi, but what brought him fame was a bronze medal in 1986 Asian Games four years later. Besides the medal in Seoul, Kurup was also at the helm when the Indian team won the silver in an international tournament in Japan in 1989.\nShyam Sunder Rao was appointed as the coach of Indian volleyball team after his success with the Junior national team. With his eyes set on a medal in the 2002 Asian Games, Sunder Rao's side missed an opportunity to end India's medal draught at the Asian Games since 1986, as they missed a place in the semi-finals by one point. However, the team went on to beat Pakistan and Chinese Taipei to finish fifth in the tournament.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is the 2022 Indian national team roster, called up for 2020 Summer Olympics qualification.&lt;br&gt;\nHead coach: G.E.

Frenchman Yohann Diniz, as the European Champion, was expected to perform well.

Zhao Chengliang, Li Lei, and Xu Faguang were suggested as candidates to win the Chinese team's first medal of the championships.\nThe final began in wet conditions, but Yuki Yamazaki and Luke Adams built up a considerable early lead. Tallent and Diniz caught up with them around the 5 km mark, but a large pack of walkers containing a number of contenders remained not far off the leaders. After the first hour, a six-strong pack of Nizhegorodov and Kirdyapkin, Tallent and Adams, and Yamazaki and Diniz had broken away from the rest. At the halfway point Yamazaki, after receiving a number of warnings, was disqualified and Schwazer decided to prematurely stop his own race.

Kirdyapkin sped ahead of Tallent and Trond Nymark had a late burst and caught up with the leaders. Kirdyapkin won, almost three minutes ahead of the rest of the competition, and Nymark took second. García, with a late charge, was not far behind and won the bronze medal.\nThe 2005 World Champion Kirdyapkin won his second title with a world-leading 3:38:35, the second fastest time of his career after his 2005 winning walk. It marked a racewalk Championship sweep for the Russians, with all three winners being coached by Viktor Chegin. Nymark won the first World Championship medal of career with a new Norwegian record, and veteran García won the fourth medal of his career, although his last came in 2001. A number of athletes set personal bests, including fourth placed Grzegorz Sudoł, but the season's fastest walkers had not performed well with Matej Tóth and Diniz finishing in tenth and twelfth, respectively.\nOn January 15, 2015, Kirdyapkin's results were disqualified for doping violations. Most of Chegin's athletes have received similar bans. Nymark received the gold medal in a ceremony during the 2016 European Athletics Championships.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nNo new records was set during this competition.\nResults.\nKey: DNF = Did not finish, DQ = Disqualified, NR = National record, PB = Personal best, SB = Seasonal best, WL = World leading (in a given season)"

The stadium also hosted some IPL matches as a home stadium for Punjab Kings.\nThe picturesque venue is unique in India as it is situated at an altitude of 1,457 m above sea level and has snow-capped Himalayan mountains in the background. Getting to Dharamsala from the nearby Kangra Airport, which is about 8 kilometres away through the hilly terrain and the harsh winters, during which it rains and snows, is a deterrent to organizing regular matches.\nDav Whatmore, the former Director of the National Cricket Academy in India had recommended during his tenure that the stadium is suitable for hosting international cricket matches. The first international team who played in this ground was the Pakistani cricket team, when they played a warm-up match against an India A side in 2005.\nThe first One Day International (ODI) at this stadium was played between India and England on 27 January 2013. England won the match by 7 wickets. The first Test at this stadium was played between India- Australia on 25–29 March 2017, India won the match.\nIn November 2015, the stadium was selected as one of the six new Test match venues in India along with the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, JSCA International Stadium Complex, Saurashtra Cricket Association Stadium, Holkar Stadium and Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium.\nThe venue has been used sporadically for IPL matches and due to its high altitude has a reputation for six hitting. Adam Gilchrist became the first player to score a century in the IPL at the HPCA stadium in 2011 against RCB, an innings that included a 122m six off Charl Langeveldt.\nACC Centre of Excellence.\nIn December 2015, Asian Cricket Council decided to set up Centre of Excellence at Dharamshala.\n2016 ICC World Twenty20.\nOn 21 July 2015, the BCCI announced the names of the eight cities which would be hosting matches during the 2016 ICC World Twenty20. Dharamshala was announced as one of the eight venues for the event. On 11 December 2015, ICC announced the fixtures of the event where the HPCA Stadium was scheduled to host all the first round Group A matches and a single Super 10 Group 2 match. Originally the marquee India v Pakistan match was scheduled to be hosted by this venue. Due to security concerns for the Pakistani team, the match was moved to Eden Gardens, Kolkata.\n2023 ICC World Cup.\nICC allocated 5 matches to the stadium, including New Zealand v India.\nReferences.\n "

The qualification and final rounds took place on 27, 29 and 30 August at the Sports Hall. There were 113 competitors from 26 nations. Each nation could send a team of 6 gymnasts or up to 3 individual gymnasts. The event was won by Sawao Kato of Japan, the third man to successfully defend an Olympic title in the event; it was Japan's third consecutive victory in the event (matching the Soviet Union for second-most at that point after Italy's four). The Japanese gymnasts swept the medals, with Eizo Kenmotsu earning silver and Akinori Nakayama. Kato and Nakayama, who had also taken bronze in 1968, were the eighth and ninth men to win multiple medals overall in the event. It was the first medal sweep in the event since France did it in the first edition in 1900. This broke the Soviet Union's five-Games medal streak, with their best gymnast (Nikolai Andrianov) finishing fourth.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nFive of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1968 Games returned: gold medalist Sawao Kato of Japan, silver medalist Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist Akinori Nakayama of Japan, fourth-place finisher Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan, and seventh-place finisher Viktor Klimenko of the Soviet Union. Kenmotsu was the reigning (1970) World Champion, with teammates Mitsuo Tsukahara and Nakayama finishing second and third.\nLiechtenstein, New Zealand, and North Korea each made their debut in the event. France and Italy both made their 14th appearance, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nAll entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around preliminary score. (One gymnast who entered the all-around competition did not perform on the vault.) Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final, with the top 36 gymnasts advancing to the individual all-around final. There, each of the finalists performed another exercise on each apparatus. The sum of these scores plus half of the preliminary score resulted in a final total.\nEach exercise was scored from 0 to 10; thus, the preliminary apparatus scores ranged from 0 to 20 each and the total preliminary score from 0 to 120. With half of the preliminary score and six more exercises scored 0 to 10, the final total was also from 0 to 120.\nThe preliminary exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 111th.\nResults.\nOne-hundred thirteen gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on 27 and 29 August. The thirty-six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on 30 August. There was no limit as to how many competitors each country could have in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes each gymnast's \"prelim\" score."

Four of the six finalists from 1968 returned: gold medalist Akinori Nakayama of Japan, silver medalist Mikhail Voronin of the Soviet Union, bronze medalist Viktor Klimenko of the Soviet Union, and fifth-place finisher Eizo Kenmotsu of Japan. Nakayama had also won the 1970 world championship, with Voronin and Kenmotsu tied for second.\nLiechtenstein, New Zealand, and North Korea each made their debut in the men's parallel bars. The United States made its 12th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. (One gymnast who entered the all-around competition did not perform on the vault.) These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score; the top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals; others were ranked 7th through 111th. Half of the scores from the preliminary carried over to the final.\nResults.\nOne-hundred twelve gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on August 27 and 29. The six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on September 1."

The United States made its 13th appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the inaugural 1896 Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe event used a \"vaulting horse\" aligned parallel to the gymnast's run (rather than the modern \"vaulting table\" in use since 2004). Each nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. The top 6 in each apparatus participated in the finals, except that nations were limited to two finalists each; others were ranked 7th through 90th. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nNinety gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 18 and 20. The six highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on July 23. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

It was contested by four national teams playing twelve games each from October 12 through November 18 in Caracas. Venezuela won their second AWS title, though in controversial fashion.\nControversy surrounded the tournament with umpiring decisions. The Dominican Republic led Venezuela going into the 9th. In the top of the inning, Venezuela rallied to take the lead. In the bottom of the inning, the umpire called the game early due to bad light, reverting the 9th inning and making the Dominican Republic the winner.\nMore controversial umpiring played a role in a Cuba–Venezuela game in the final phase of the event. After a Venezuelan errored the ball during a close play at first, a photographer came over and threw the ball to one of the Venezuelan players, which led to an out. The Cuban manager protested the call and was told by the umpires that photographers were allowed to intervene in play. Due to this, Cuba withdrew from the Cup and their remaining game was forfeited; they were credited with a third-place finish nonetheless.\nCuba's withdrawal was closely followed by that of Mexico, who also withdrew from the tournament after more controversial umpiring decisions in favour of Venezuela, forfeiting the final round and finishing second.\nStandings.\nFirst round\nSecond round\nFinal round\n&lt;br&gt;"

He was the third captain of the England rugby team.\nPersonal life.\nLawrence was born at Lahore in 1848, the second son of John Lawrence, 1st Baron Lawrence, and his wife Harriette Katherine (née Hamilton). His father was Viceroy of India between 1864 and 1869. Lawrence was educated at Wellington College, Berkshire, before matriculating to Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1866. He was a Director of the London office of the Ottoman Bank. He spent his later life in Box, Gloucestershire, where he died on 18 April 1902, aged 54.\nRugby career.\nLawrence first came to note as a rugby player when he represented Richmond. In 1873, Lawrence was selected to play for the England national rugby team, in their third match in an encounter against Scotland; the game ended in a draw. Lawrence was reselected for the next encounter with Scotland the next season, and in 1875 he was given the captaincy of his country, in the team's first ever match against the newly formed Ireland team. His fourth and final game saw Lawrence retain the captaincy for the 1875 encounter with Scotland.\nFamily.\nIn 1876, he married Constance Charlotte Davies (died 1929), daughter of the Reverend George Davies, Rector of Kelsale, in Suffolk. They had three sons, John Dalhousie (1887–1900), Malcolm Eyton (born 1889), and Christopher Hal (born 1893), and three daughters, Constance Letitia (1881–1946), Phyllis May (1882–1956), and Mary Paolina (1886–1963). \nSecond Lieutenant Christopher Hal Lawrence (1893–1914), of the 2nd Battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps, educated at Eton College and Trinity College, Cambridge, was killed by a sniper in the trenches during action on 13 October 1914, during World War I, less than two weeks after arriving in France. The location of his grave is unknown and he is commemorated at the La Ferté-sous-Jouarre memorial.\nLieutenant Malcolm Lawrence (1889–1915), was educated at Eton and lived in Canada for four years before returning to Great Britain and being commissioned in the 6th Battalion of the King's Royal Rifles in November 1914. He was killed in action on 10 January 1915. The location of his grave was unknown until his remains were discovered along with several others during construction excavations in 1928. The remains were interred at the Arras Road Cemetery, Roclincourt, France."

        "title": "New York Giants (baseball)",
        "text": "The New York Giants were a Major League Baseball team in the National League that began play in the season as the New York Gothams and became known as the Giants in . They continued as the New York Giants until the team moved to San Francisco, California after the 1957 season, where the team continues its history as the San Francisco Giants. The team moved west at the same time as its longtime rival, the Brooklyn Dodgers, also in the National League, moved to Los Angeles in southern California as the Los Angeles Dodgers, continuing the National League, same-state rivalry.\nDuring most of their 75 seasons in New York City, the Giants played home games at various incarnations of the Polo Grounds in Upper Manhattan.\nNumerous inductees of the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum played for the New York Giants, including Christy Mathewson (a member of the Hall of Fame's inaugural class), John McGraw, Mel Ott, Bill Terry, Willie Mays, Monte Irvin, Frankie Frisch, Ross Youngs and Travis Jackson. During the club's tenure in New York, it won five of the franchise's eight World Series wins and 17 of its 23 National League pennants. Famous moments in the Giants' New York history include the 1922 World Series, in which the Giants swept the Yankees in four games, Bobby Thomson's 1951 home run known as the \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\", and the defensive feat by Willie Mays during the first game of the 1954 World Series known as \"the Catch\".\nThe Giants had intense rivalries with their fellow New York teams the New York Yankees and the Brooklyn Dodgers, facing the Yankees in six World Series and playing the league rival Dodgers multiple times per season. Games between any two of these three teams were known collectively as the Subway Series.\nThe New York Giants of the National Football League were named after the team and were founded as the \"New York Football Giants\" to distinguish the two clubs of the same name, where it would remain as its corporate name to this day.\nEarly days.\nThe Giants began as the second baseball club founded by millionaire tobacconist John B. Day and veteran amateur baseball player Jim Mutrie. The Gothams, as the Giants were originally known, entered the National League seven years after its 1876 formation, in 1883, while their other club, the Metropolitans played in the rival American Association (1882–1891). Nearly half of the original Gothams players were members of the disbanded Troy Trojans in upstate New York, whose place in the National League the Gothams inherited. While the Metropolitans were initially the more successful club, after they won the 1884 AA championship, Day and Mutrie began moving star players to the NL Gothams, whose fortunes improved while the Metropolitans' afterwards slumped.\nIt is said that after one particularly satisfying victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, Mutrie (who was also the team's manager) stormed into the dressing room and exclaimed, \"My big fellows! My giants!\" From then on (1885), the club was known as the Giants. However, more recent research has suggested that the \"New York World\" was already widely using the Giants nickname throughout the 1885 season, before the legendary game was played.\nThe team won its first National League pennant in 1888, as well as a victory over the St. Louis Browns in an early incarnation of the pre-modern-era World Series. They repeated as champions the next year with a pennant and world championship victory over Brooklyn.\nThe Giants' original home stadium, the Polo Grounds, also dates from this early era. It had been built in 1876 as a pitch for playing polo, and was located north of Central Park adjacent to Fifth and Sixth Avenues and 110th and 112th Streets, in Harlem in upper Manhattan. After their eviction from that first incarnation of the Polo Grounds after the 1888 season, they moved further uptown to various fields which they also named the \"Polo Grounds\" located between 155th and 159th Streets in Harlem and Washington Heights, playing at the famous Washington Heights location at the foot of Coogan's Bluff until the end of the 1957 season, when they moved to San Francisco.\nThe Giants were a powerhouse in the late 1880s, winning their first two National League Pennants and World Championships in 1888 and 1889. But nearly all of the Giants' stars jumped to the upstart newly organized rival loop, the Players' League, whose New York franchise was also named the Giants, in 1890. The new team even built a stadium next door to the NL Polo Grounds. With a decimated roster, the NL Giants finished a distant sixth. Attendance took a nosedive, and the financial strain affected Day's tobacco business as well. The Players' League dissolved after the single season, and Day sold a minority interest in his NL Giants to the defunct PL Giants' principal backer, Edward Talcott. As a condition of the sale, Day had to fire Mutrie as manager. Although the Giants rebounded to third place in 1891, Day was forced to sell a controlling interest to Talcott at the end of the '91 season.\nFour years later, Talcott sold the Giants to Andrew Freedman, a real estate developer with ties to the Tammany Hall, the political machine of the Democratic Party that ran New York City. Freedman was one of the most detested owners in baseball history, getting into heated disputes with other owners, writers and his own players, most famously with star pitcher Amos Rusie, author of the first Giants no-hitter. When Freedman offered Rusie only $2,500 for 1896, the disgruntled hurler sat out the entire season. Attendance fell off throughout the league without Rusie, prompting the other owners to chip in $50,000 to get him to return for 1897. Freedman even hired former owner Day as manager for part of the 1899 season.\nThe John McGraw era.\nIn 1902, after a series of disastrous moves that left the Giants games behind the front-runner, Freedman signed John McGraw as player-manager, convincing him to jump in mid-season from the Baltimore Orioles (1901–1902) of the fledgling American League and bring with him several of his teammates. McGraw went on to manage the Giants for three decades until 1932, one of the longest and most successful tenures in professional sports. Hiring \"Mr. McGraw\", as his players referred to him, was one of Freedman's last significant moves as owner of the Giants, since after that 1902 season he was forced to sell his interest in the club to John T. Brush. McGraw went on to manage the Giants to nine National League pennants (in 1904, 1905, and every year from 1911 to 1913) and three World Series championships (in 1905, 1921, and 1922), with a tenth pennant and fourth world championship as Giants owner in 1933 under his handpicked player-manager successor, Bill Terry.\nThe Giants already had their share of stars beginning in the 1880s and 1890s, such as \"Smiling\" Mickey Welch, Roger Connor, Tim Keefe, Jim O'Rourke, and John Montgomery Ward, the player-lawyer who formed the renegade Players' League in 1890 to protest unfair player contracts. McGraw, a veteran of the infamous 1890s Baltimore Orioles, in his three decades managing the Giants, McGraw managed star players including Christy Mathewson, \"Iron Man\" Joe McGinnity, Jim Thorpe, Red Ames, Casey Stengel, Art Nehf, Edd Roush, Rogers Hornsby, Bill Terry and Mel Ott.\nThe Giants under McGraw famously snubbed their first modern World Series chance in 1904 by refusing the invitation to play the reigning world champion Boston Americans (Red Sox) because McGraw considered the newly established American League of 1901, as little more than a minor league and disliked its firebrand president, Ban Johnson. He also resented his Giants' new intra-city rival New York Highlanders, who almost won the pennant but lost to Boston on the last day, and stuck by his refusal to play whoever won the 1904 AL pennant.\nThe ensuing criticism resulted in Brush's taking the lead to formalize the rules and format of the World Series. The Giants won the 1905 World Series over Connie Mack's Philadelphia Athletics, with Christy Mathewson nearly winning the series single-handedly with a still-standing record three complete-game shutouts and 27 consecutive scoreless innings in that one World Series.\nThe Giants then had several frustrating years. In 1908, they finished in a tie with the Chicago Cubs due to a late-season home tie game with the Cubs resulting from the Fred Merkle baserunning \"boner\". They lost the postseason replay of the tie game (ordered by NL president Harry Pulliam) to the Cubs (after disgruntled Giants fans had set fire to the stands the morning of the game), who would go on to win their second (consecutive, and their last for the next 108 years) World Series. That post-season game was further darkened by a story that someone on the Giants had attempted to bribe umpire Bill Klem. This could have been a disastrous scandal for baseball, but because Klem was honest and the Giants lost the duel between Christy Mathewson and Mordecai \"Three-Fingered\" Brown 4–2, it faded over time.\nThe Giants experienced a mixture of success and hard luck in the early 1910s, losing three straight World Series in 1911–1913 to the A's, Red Sox and A's again (two seasons later, both the Giants and the A's, decimated by the short-lived rival third loop, the Federal League of 1914–1915, with the \"jumping ship\" signings of many of their stars, finished in last place). After losing the 1917 Series to the Chicago White Sox (the last World Series win for the White Sox until 2005), the Giants played in four straight World Series in the early 1920s, winning the first two over their Polo Grounds tenants, the Yankees, who had won the first two of their many pennants, led by their new young slugger Babe Ruth, then losing to the Yankees in 1923 after the original Yankee Stadium had opened that May. They also lost in 1924, when the Washington Senators won their only World Series while in D.C. From 1923 to 1927, the team held their spring training at Payne Park in Sarasota, Florida.\n1930–1957: Five pennants in 28 seasons.\nMcGraw handed over the team to Bill Terry midway through the 1932 season. Terry served as manager for nine-and-a-half years, serving as player-manager until 1936. Under Terry, the Giants won three pennants, defeating the Senators in the 1933 World Series but swept by the Yankees in consecutive fall classics, 1936 and 1937. Aside from Terry himself, the other stars of the era were slugger Mel Ott and southpaw hurler Carl Hubbell. Known as \"King Carl\" and \"The Meal Ticket\", Hubbell gained fame in the first two innings of the 1934 All-Star Game (played at the Polo Grounds) by striking out five future AL Hall of Famers in a row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.\nOtt succeeded Terry as manager in 1942, but the war years proved to be difficult for the Giants. Midway during the 1948 season Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher left as Dodgers skipper to manage the Giants, not without controversy. Not only was such a midseason managerial switch unprecedented, but Durocher had been accused of gambling in 1947 and subsequently suspended for that whole season by Baseball Commissioner Albert \"Happy\" Chandler. Durocher's ensuing eight full seasons managing the Giants proved some of the most memorable for their fans, particularly because of the arrival of five-tool superstar Willie Mays, their two pennants in 1951 and 1954, their unexpected sweep of the powerful (111–43) Cleveland Indians in the 1954 World Series and arguably the two most famous plays in Giants history.\n1951: The \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\".\nThe \"Shot Heard 'Round the World,\" or Bobby Thomson's come-from-behind ninth-inning walk-off home run that won the National League pennant for the Giants over their bitter rivals, the Brooklyn Dodgers, in the deciding game of a three-game playoff series ended one of baseball's most memorable pennant races. The Giants had been games behind the league-leading Dodgers in August, but under Durocher's guidance and with a 16-game winning streak, got hot and caught the Dodgers to tie for the lead on the next-to-last day of the season.\nMays's catch and the 1954 Series.\nIn Game 1 of the 1954 World Series at the Polo Grounds against the Cleveland Indians, Willie Mays made \"The Catch,\" a dramatic over-the-shoulder catch of a fly ball by Vic Wertz after sprinting with his back to the plate on a dead run to deepest center field. At the time the game was tied 2–2 in the eighth inning, with men on first and second and nobody out. Mays caught the ball from the plate, whirled and threw the ball to the infield, keeping the lead runner, Larry Doby, from scoring. Doby advanced to third on the play, and then new pitcher Marv Grissom walked Dale Mitchell to load the bases. Grissom then struck out Dave Pope looking and got Jim Hegan to fly out to left fielder Monte Irvin to end the inning.\nGrissom got out of another jam in the ninth when 1953 AL MVP Al Rosen flew out to Irvin with two outs and two on.\nIn the tenth, Grissom faced more trouble, but got Hall of Fame pitcher Bob Lemon to line out with runners on the corners and 2 outs, preserving the tie game.\nIn the bottom of the tenth, Willie Mays drew a 1 out walk and stole second base, thus prompting Lemon to intentionally walk Hank Thompson. And with runners on first and second with one out, pinch hitter Dusty Rhodes hit a walk off home run that just squeaked over the right field wall at an estimated .\nThe underdog Giants went on to sweep the series in four straight, despite the Indians' American League 111–43 regular season. The 1954 World Series title would be their last appearance in the World Series as the New York Giants, with the team moving to San Francisco to start the 1958 season.\nNew York Giants of the 1950s.\nIn addition to Bobby Thomson and Willie Mays, other memorable New York Giants of the 1950s include Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher, coach Herman Franks, Hall of Fame outfielder Monte Irvin, outfielder and runner-up for the 1954 NL batting championship (won by Willie Mays) Don Mueller, Hall of Fame knuckleball relief pitcher Hoyt Wilhelm, starting pitchers Larry Jansen, Sal Maglie, Jim Hearn, Marv Grissom, Dave Koslo, Don Liddle, Max Lanier, Rubén Gómez, Al Worthington, and Johnny Antonelli, catcher Wes Westrum, catchers Ray Katt and Sal Yvars, shortstop Alvin Dark, third baseman Hank Thompson, first baseman Whitey Lockman, second basemen Davey Williams and Eddie Stanky, outfielder-pitcher Clint Hartung and utility men Johnny Mize, Bill Rigney, Daryl Spencer, Bobby Hofman, Joey Amalfitano, Tookie Gilbert, and 1954 Series hero Dusty Rhodes, among others. In the late 1950s and after the move to San Francisco two Hall of Fame first basemen, Orlando Cepeda and Willie McCovey, joined the team.\n1957: Move to California.\nThe Giants' final three years in New York City were unmemorable. They stumbled to third place the year after their World Series win, and attendance fell off precipitously. Even before then, the Polo Grounds had become an albatross around the team. It had not been well maintained since the 1940s, and any renovations would have been hindered by the fact that the Giants did not own the parcel of land on which it stood. The Polo Grounds had almost no parking, and the neighborhood around it had become less desirable.\nWhile seeking a new stadium to replace the crumbling Polo Grounds, the Giants began to contemplate a move from New York, initially considering Metropolitan Stadium in Bloomington, Minnesota, which was home to their top farm team, the Minneapolis Millers. Under the rules of the time, the Giants' ownership of the Millers gave them priority rights to a major league team in the area (the Senators wound up there as the Minnesota Twins in 1961).\nAt this time, the Giants were approached by San Francisco mayor George Christopher. Despite objections from shareholders such as Joan Whitney Payson, majority owner Horace Stoneham entered into negotiations with San Francisco officials around the same time the Dodgers' owner Walter O'Malley was courting the city of Los Angeles. O'Malley had been told that the Dodgers would not be allowed to move to Los Angeles unless a second team moved to California as well. He pushed Stoneham toward moving, and so in the summer of 1957 both the Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers announced their moves to California, ending the three-team golden age of baseball in New York City.\nNew York would remain a one-team town with the New York Yankees until 1962, when former Giants minority owner Joan Whitney Payson founded the New York Mets and brought National League baseball back to the city (as part of MLB's first wave of expansion). Mets chairman M. Donald Grant had represented Payson on the Giants board, and as such had been the only board member to vote against the Giants' move to California. The \"NY\" script on the Giants' caps and the orange trim on their uniforms, along with the blue background used by the Dodgers, would be adopted by the Mets, honoring their New York NL forebears with a blend of Giants orange and Dodgers blue.\nRivalry with the Dodgers.\nThe historic and heated rivalry between the Giants and the Dodgers is more than a century old. It began when the Giants and Brooklyn Bridegrooms (later known as the Dodgers) faced each other in the 1889 World Series, the ancestor of the Subway Series, and both played in separate, neighboring cities (New York and Brooklyn were separate cities until 1898, when they became neighboring boroughs of the newly expanded New York City). When both franchises moved to California after the 1957 season, the rivalry was easily transplanted, as the cities of San Francisco and Los Angeles have long been economic, political, and cultural rivals, representative of the broader Northern/Southern California divide."

        "text": "Douglas Dwyer Clark (born March 5, 1976) is an American professional baseball coach and former player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics, and in the KBO League for the Hanwha Eagles and Nexen Heroes.\nEarly career.\nClark was a star high-school football, basketball and tennis player at Springfield Central High School in Springfield, Massachusetts. He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a football scholarship as a wide receiver. He was a walk-on to the baseball team, and in three seasons posted a career batting average of .366 with 21 home runs, 137 runs batted in (RBIs), and 49 stolen bases. Clark was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 20th round of the 1997 MLB draft following his sophomore season, but returned for his junior year. Following that season, he was selected in the 7th round of the 1998 MLB draft by the San Francisco Giants.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nClark signed with the Giants in 1998 and was assigned to the Single-A Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Northwest League. He spent the majority of the 1999 season with the Single-A Bakersfield Blaze and had a successful stint with them, batting .326 with 11 home runs, 58 RBI and 17 stolen bases. He also played 15 games with the Double-A Shreveport Captains. Clark spent the entire 2000 and 2001 seasons in Shreveport. He enjoyed two fairly successful seasons, hitting .272 with 10 home runs and 75 RBI in 2000, and .275 with 6 home runs, 51 RBI and 20 stolen bases in 2001. In 2002, Clark started the season again with the Double-A Captains before being called up to the Triple-A Fresno Grizzlies. He also spent 2003 between Double-A and Triple-A, although with a new Double-A affiliate of the Giants, the Norwich Navigators. Clark played the entire 2004 season in Norwich, batting .292 with 4 home runs and 49 RBI.\nClark started the 2005 season with the Triple-A Grizzlies. He played in 127 games with the Grizzlies batting .316 with 13 home runs and 59 RBI. On September 14, 2005, Clark made his major league debut with the Giants. Clark appeared in eight games with San Francisco, mainly as a pinch hitter, pinch runner, or defensive replacement. He did not record a hit, but scored two runs.\nOakland Athletics.\nAt the end of the season, Clark was granted free agency by the Giants and was signed by the Oakland A's. Clark started the 2006 season with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. He was called up to the major-league A's and made his first appearance with them on June 20, 2006. Clark appeared in six games as a pinch hitter and recorded his first major-league hit. He was then returned to Sacramento where he finished the season hitting .287 with 15 home runs and 67 RBI.\nAtlanta Braves.\nAt the end of the 2006 season, Clark was again granted free agency, and was signed by the Atlanta Braves. He attempted to make the major-league roster in spring training, and while he batted .429 during spring training he failed to secure a roster spot and was assigned to the Triple-A Richmond Braves. Clark played in 134 games with Richmond and hit .275 with 15 home runs and 69 RBI. At the end of the 2007 season, Clark was released by the Braves.\nHanwha Eagles.\nPrior to a game in Richmond during the 2007 season, Clark had been introduced to a Korean baseball scout who stated that he liked the way that Clark played. Prior to the 2008 season, Clark signed on with the Hanwha Eagles of the KBO League. That season in Korea, Clark hit 23 home runs with 80 RBI and 23 stolen bases, and was named an all-star. However, a midseason knee injury caused his average to drop from .315 to .250.\nNexen Heroes.\nIn 2009, Clark signed and played with the Nexen Heroes within the KBO League, hitting .290 with 24 home runs and 90 RBI. He started the 2010 season with the Heroes, hitting .265 with 12 homers and 50 RBI, but was released from the team in July.\nMexican baseball.\nAfter leaving the Korean league, Clark was signed by the Mexican League team Tigres de Quintana Roo for the 2011 season. He compiled a .315 batting average, .424 on-base percentage, and .579 slugging percentage, and by the end of the season was the team's starting left fielder. The team won the league championship in 2011. Clark returned to the Tigres in 2012 and 2013, batting .328 and .319 during those seasons, respectively. During the 2014 season, Clark played 30 games with Broncos de Reynosa where he batted .272, and 25 games with Diablos Rojos del México where he had a .306 average.\nClark also played multiple seasons of winter baseball in the Mexican Pacific League, first in 2005–06 with Mayos de Navojoa and finally in 2014–15 with Venados de Mazatlán, his final professional team.\nCoaching career.\nClark coached for seven years in the San Francisco Giants organization, reaching the Double-A level as hitting coach for the Richmond Flying Squirrels. For the 2022 season, Clark moved to the Boston Red Sox organization, and was named hitting coach for the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs."

She had set a career best and had the four longest throws of any athlete that season, although she had not competed since late June. Franka Dietzsch was another prominent performer: the 41-year-old was the defending champion and was making her 10th appearance of the tournament, but a weak season had underlined her waning powers. Cuban Yarelis Barrios looked set to build upon her World and Olympic silver medals from the last two years and Aimin Song had also performed well during the season. Veteran athletes Nicoleta Grasu and Natalya Sadova were also favoured to be among the top performers of the competition.\nChinese athletes led the qualification rounds with Ma Xuejun and Song topping their respective groups. Newcomers Żaneta Glanc and Dani Samuels rounded out the top four qualifiers. Dietzsch sole legal throw of the competition was not enough for qualification, leaving Nadine Müller as the only host competitor to make the final. Brown Trafton edged into the final, needing all three throws to qualify.\nIn the final, Grasu and Barrios quickly established themselves with marks of 65.20 m and 64.44 m, respectively, in the first two throws. Samuels, Glanc and Müller proved themselves on their third attempts, each throwing over 62 metres. Brown Trafton and Ma Xuejun both threw poorly and were among the four athletes eliminated after three throws. Personal bests of 64.76 and 65.44 m in the fourth and fifth round put Samuels in the lead. On the final throws, Song threw only enough to move up to fifth place, leader Grasu fouled but Barrios responded, although her mark of 65.31 m guaranteed her only second place.\nSamuels was a surprise winner: at 21 years old, she was the youngest ever World discus champion, and she had progressed from Youth champion, to Junior winner, to the senior title in just four years. Barrios had matched her silver medal achievement at the 2008 Summer Olympics, and Grasu's bronze was her fourth medal in her career at the World Championships.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: Qualifying Performance 61.50 (Q) or at least 12 best performers (q) advance to the final."

        "text": "John \"Doc\" Holliday (born April 21, 1957) is an American former college football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Marshall University from 2010 to 2020, compiling a record of 85–54.\nEarly life.\nHolliday was born and raised in Hurricane, West Virginia, where he was a football star as well as a state champion wrestler at Hurricane High School. He graduated from West Virginia University with a bachelor's degree in Physical Education in 1979, then graduated with a master's degree in 1981 in Safety Management.\nHolliday was also a three-year letterwinner while playing linebacker at West Virginia.\nCoaching career.\nFirst stint at West Virginia.\nIn 1979, Holliday became a graduate assistant for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team. Then in 1981, he became a part-time assistant until 1982. Holliday became wide receivers coach in 1983 and remained at that position until 1989.\nIn 1990, Holliday became the inside linebackers coach. He remained to coach the linebackers until 1992. In 1993, he returned to coaching the receivers. In 1995, Holliday was promoted to assistant head coach, while still maintaining receivers.\nDuring his tenure at West Virginia University under head coach Don Nehlen, Holliday achieved a prestigious record. He coached the top three career and single-season reception leaders in school history and eight of the top ten players in both categories. His favorite holiday is Halloween. He also coached the leading receivers in the Big East in 1996, 1997, and 1998 while also coaching three of the top six receivers in Big East history. He coached third-team All-American receiver Reggie Rembert, three-time all-Big East receiver Rahsaan Vanterpool, all-Big East receiver David Saunders, all-Big East receiver Shawn Foreman, an all-Big East receiver Khori Ivy during his tenure and also was responsible for seven eventual NFL draftees.\nHolliday was also the main recruiting coach in the Florida-area for West Virginia University. Holliday was responsible for recruiting major stars, such as linebacker Steve Grant, and became one of the best recruiters in the nation. He also helped the Mountaineers to 12 bowl games in his twenty years at West Virginia University.\nNC State.\nIn 2000, Holliday left West Virginia for North Carolina State. There he became the associate head coach and wide receivers coach. He remained at NC State until 2004.\nDuring his time in North Carolina, Holliday coached three of the top eight receivers in school history: Koren Robinson, Bryan Peterson and Jerricho Cotchery. In 2001, the squad set school records for completion percentage and fewest turnovers, while the 2002 team led the ACC in scoring. That squad also finished with school records of total yards, passing yards, most points scored, and most first downs in a season. The 2003 squad then set records in pass attempts, pass completions, passing yards, passing yards per game, passing touchdowns, and pass completion percentage.\nFlorida.\nIn 2005, Holliday traveled to the University of Florida and became the Gators' associate head coach, safeties coach, and recruiting coordinator under head coach Urban Meyer. In 2005, Holliday was named one of Rivals.com's Top 25 Recruiters, while also tutoring a secondary that only allowed 52.3% of passing to be completed which was 16th best in the nation.\nHe guided safety Reggie Nelson to a consensus All-American honor and to become a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award and Bronko Nagurski Trophy in 2006. Also in that season, the Gators' pass defense efficiency was fourth-ranked nationally and second in the SEC while only surrendering a nationally tenth-ranked 10 touchdowns all season and sixth in the nation in scoring defense.\nSecond stint at West Virginia.\nWhen West Virginia University head coach Rich Rodriguez left the team before their Fiesta Bowl game to assume the head coaching position at the University of Michigan, Doc Holliday's name surfaced as a candidate in the Mountaineers' head coach search. Holliday was named by several news outlets to be the front-runner for the job, outpacing former Auburn head coach Terry Bowden, Florida State offensive line coach Rick Trickett, and Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster.\nInstead, on January 12, 2008, it was announced that Holliday was to be named West Virginia's associate head coach, tight end coach, fullback coach, and recruiting coordinator for head coach Bill Stewart. Doc Holliday and Stewart helped pull in a recruiting class with 23 letters of intents on signing day. The 2008 class, led by 5-star offensive guard Josh Jenkins from Parkersburg, West Virginia, was ranked 36th by Scout.com and 44th by Rivals.com.\nMarshall.\nOn December 16, 2009, sources, who asked to remain anonymous, told the \"Charleston Gazette\" that no deal has been finalized, but that Holliday was the apparent choice to succeed Mark Snyder, who chose to resign rather than be fired as the MU coach. On December 17, 2009, Marshall made it official naming Holliday as the next head coach for the Thundering Herd football team. Marshall athletic director Mike Hamrick said Holliday signed a five-year contract and would be paid $600,000 per season. In July 2014, Holliday signed a two-year contract extension.\nAfter leading Marshall to its first Conference USA championship in 2014, Holliday was named C-USA Coach of the Year. He also received a contract extension through 2021 and a salary of $755,000 a year at the end of the season.\nOn January 4, 2021, Holliday announced that his contract with Marshall had not been renewed and that he was out as head coach."

From 1986 to 2014 it was under jurisdiction of the Hellenic Ice Skating Federation. There are currently 200 players registered.\nHistory.\nHockey was played no later than from the beginning of the 20th century by Greeks in America, even the modern Greek words for ice hockey (\"hockey epi pagou\") and skates (\"pagopedila\") are from an older form of the language, as spoken in the first half of the 20th century.\nIce hockey started in Greece in 1984 by players that returned to Greece from abroad. Soon later five teams were formed, two in Athens, one in Piraeus, one in Salonica and one in Chalkida. The first official game was played in 1985 in Athens.\nThe first official Greek Championship was held in 1989 in the Peace and Friendship Stadium with five teams taking place. It was the first time hockey games were held in a normal size rink. The following year the Championship was held once again in the Peace and Friendship Stadium.\nIn 1991, the first junior national team was formed and took part in the World Junior Championship Pool C, held in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. In 1992, the junior national team once again took part in the World Junior Championship Pool C, this time held in Marino and Rome, Italy.\nIn 1992, the first-ever men's Greek national team was formed and took place in the Men's World Ice Hockey Championships in Pool C2 held in Johannesburg, South Africa. With only two weeks of serious training abroad and the support of the Greeks of South Africa, the national team won the bronze medal. It was extraordinary for a team to win a medal in their first appearance at the World Championships.\nDespite the great achievement, the decline of the sport came in 1993. Economic help was discontinued by the Greek Undersecretary of State for Sports and all expenses to keep ice hockey alive were passed over to the players. Practices stopped and many players quit.\nPractices started again in 1995 but were limited to once a week. Despite the hard times ice hockey faced, a national team was formed in 1995 and took part in the World Championships held once again in Johannesburg, South Africa (and also Krugersdorp, South Africa). Unfortunately, the problems affected the players and they were unable to defend the bronze medal they had won three years ago. They won one game and tied one in five games.\nAlthough the problems continued to exist, in 1996, the Junior National Team took part in the European Championships. They made one win in five games. In March 1998, the men's national team went to the World Championships held in South Africa. They won one game and, despite all the problems, everyone was amazed at the level of Greek ice hockey.\nBy early 1999, nothing had changed concerning the funds from the Greek Undersecretary of State for Sports. Despite this, the men's national team took part in the World Championships Pool D held once again in South Africa. The team won one game.\nIn 2001, the Moschato Ice Rink closed down. Many players stopped playing and others started practicing in the only ice rink left in Greece. An ice rink far too small to be able to hold a serious ice hockey game.\nIn 2002, the effort was made to rebuild the league, but all efforts fell short.\nThe only ice rink left in Greece closed down definitely in May 2003.\nAfter the closing of the last ice rink, the players of the national team decided to take trips to the Czech Republic for practices and games. Since that decision, 6 trips have been organized. Every 6 months, the players of the national team pay their own way and travel to the Czech Republic.\nIn 2007 Dimitrios Kalyvas convinced the IIHF that despite not having a rink, development of the sport is continuing in Greece. The efforts paid off, since the IIHF, after investigation decided to allow the National Team to compete again in international competition. This was great for Greek ice hockey since the national team competed again in 1999. The National Team played in the 2008 IIHF World Championship Division III Qualification and qualified to play in the 2008 IIHF World Championship Division III.\nAfter their qualification a new ice rink opened again for the first time since 2003 and the Greek Championship was established once again.\nThe first Greek Ice Hockey Championship in the new era of Greek Ice Hockey was held in 2008 and the Greek Ice Hockey Champs were Iptamenoi Pagodromoi Athinai. They won again in 2009 and 2010.\nTeams.\nThe Greek Ice Hockey Championship consists of 7 teams based in Athens and Serres.\nCurrent teams.\nActive Teams: \nFolded Teams:\nFormat.\nIn the last and best Greek Championship ever played in 2013, the teams were separated in 2 Groups. North and South. 5 Teams were in the North Group and 6 in the South Group. In the Regular Season, all teams in the same group play twice against each other and the top 2 qualify for the Final Four which is held in the Ano Liosia Olympic Hall located in Ano Liosia, Athens.\nChampions.\n\"* The President of the Greek Federation did not allow Iptamenoi Pagodromoi Athinai participate in the Greek Championship despite the team being active.\"\n\"** Iptamenoi Pagodromoi Athinai and Albatros Athens did not participate despite both teams being active.\""

Minimizing his effort, he only took one (successful) attempt in qualifying and two attempts in the final. Hooker waited until only three other competitors were left in the field. Hooker agonized in the pit after missing his attempt at 5.85, then watched Romain Mesnil clear. After one failure Renaud Lavillenie joined Hooker in passing to the next height while Maksym Mazuryk, who had passed to get to 5.85 exhausted his attempts. Constantly stretching and massaging his hamstring, Hooker successfully cleared 5.90 with room to spare, leaping from nothing to first place.

After a protest, both Lewandowski and Som were allowed to compete in the final. With the extra athletes on the track the two time qualifiers, Alfred Kirwa Yego in lane 1 and Mbulaeni Mulaudzi in lane 8, had to share their lanes with Som in 1 and Lewandowski in 8. None of the people sharing lanes conceded space, Som leading Yego around the outside of the turn effectively boxing out Yego, Yusuf Saad Kamel and Yeimer López. With typically slow starters Nick Symmonds and Yuriy Borzakovskiy in the middle lanes, Som had a free run from the inside but Mulaudzi, Lewandowski and Amine Laâlou a strong wave from the outside to take the lead. Atypically, neither Symmonds nor Borzakovskiy were content to take the rear, both working their way through the crowd to join Mulaudzi at the front of the pack by the end of the first lap, exchanging arms and elbows in the process. Lewandowski was boxed in by the action on the outside and began to fall back through the pack while Symmonds took a strong position on Mulaudzi's shoulder, Laâlou right behind Mulaudzi with Som in their wake. Everyone held position on the backstretch save Borzakovskiy who noticeably fell back to behind Lewandowski on the back of the pack, which would be the normal place Borzakovskiy would launch his finishing kick, but not after losing so much ground. From the back group, through the final turn, Kamel went to the outside and started passing people, followed by Yego and then Borzakovskiy doing the same thing. Yego pulled out to lane 3 for running room, Borzakovskiy to lane 4, Kamel, Yego and Borzakovskiy, moving faster than the others ahead of them. Symmonds held second place until Kamel passed him, then the wind went out of his sails. Laâlou edged ahead but was getting passed by the rush. Mulaudzi was able to lean over the line in first, falling flat on his face just past the finish line. Yeo and Kamel crossed together with Yego getting the photo finish nod for silver. Borzakovskiy caught everyone else but ran out of track to get into the medals.\nRecords.\nPrior to the competition, the following records were as follows.\nResults.\nHeats.\nQualification: First 3 in each heat (Q) and the next 3 fastest (q) advance to the semi-finals.\nKey: NR = National record, Q = qualification by place in heat, q = qualification by overall place, SB = Seasonal best\nSemifinals.\nQualification: First 2 in each semifinal (Q) and the next 2 fastest (q) advance to the final.\nX: In the first semifinals heat, Marcin Lewandowski fell over Bram Som who had tripped over Abubaker Kaki, who had fallen on his own account.

He made his first representative appearance in 1925 at the time when the Queensland Rugby Union administration was dormant rendering the New South Wales Waratahs the top Australian representative rugby union side of the period 1919 to 1929. A number of the Waratah fixtures of 1920s which were played against full international opposition and in which Ross appeared were decreed by the Australian Rugby Union in 1986 as official Test matches.\nIn 1925 Ross debuted with appearances for New South Wales against New Zealand in a first XV, a second XV and an \"A\" XV. He played 13 tests with New South Wales between 1925 and 1930 and received five Blues from Sydney University in each of the years 1925 to 1929.\nHe made three Test appearances against New Zealand in 1926 and then was selected for the 1927–28 New South Wales rugby union tour of the British Isles, France and Canada captained by Johnnie Wallace where he played in all five Tests of the tour plus 24 of the minor matches. He was a stalwart of the nine-month tour and appeared in 29 of the total 38 matches - more than any other player.\nIn 2009, he was honoured in the fourth set of inductees into the Australian Rugby Union Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Rugby union in the Soviet Union",
        "text": "Rugby union in the Soviet Union was a moderately popular sport. It was most popular in the Georgian SSR; parts of the Russian SFSR such as Moscow and certain regions in Siberia like Krasnoyarsk; and Alma-Ata, the capital of the Kazakh SSR. Rugby enjoyed a more limited popularity in the Ukrainian SSR, Minsk in the Byelorussian SSR and parts of the RSFSR such as Leningrad and areas in Southern Russia, including Krasnodar. Rugby gained a significant following due to the vast size of the Soviet Union, but was never a major sport; despite many attempts to develop the sport, which Soviet citizens came to nickname the \"leather melon\" due to the shape of the ball. Still, an early championship in 1960 gives an idea of the sheer scale of Soviet rugby: one hundred teams from over thirty cities took part.\nAlthough the name \"Russia\" or \"Soviet Russia\" was often used as a synonym for the USSR, this did not give a true reflection in rugby terms: there were regularly six or seven Georgians in the USSR side. Russians made up only about half of the Soviet population, the other half, nearly a hundred million Soviet citizens, were not Russians.\nSports clubs were invariably not autonomous bodies, but were part of Palaces of Culture, or Universities, or Military Bodies, such as air force academies and the Red Army itself. These were the so called Voluntary Sports Societies of the Soviet Union. As David Lane writes in the \"Politics and Society in the USSR\":\nThese Palaces of Culture were run by trade unions, who both financed them, and also took any revenue raised from them in matches etc. Each sports club had its own rules and membership cards, and was subsidised by trade union dues. To join a club, a person paid the small sum of thirty kopecks a year.\nClubs were named for their trade union. For example, RC Lokomotiv Moscow (now a rugby league club) was part of the Lokomotiv Society, which was in turn connected to the All-Union Voluntary Sports Society of rail transport workers' Trade Unions. (The \"RC\" stands for \"Rugby Club\") Ironically, this naming system has proven surprisingly resilient and even today is to be found in the names of various Eastern European sports clubs, long after the fall of the Iron Curtain. The main name elements in sports clubs, with their trade union affiliations were as follows (an example of a rugby club with the element is also listed):\nAs well as the trade unions, there were two non-T.U. prefixes:\nIn the 1938 Soviet Championship for example, the first, second and third places were all won by Moscow teams - Dynamo, Spartak and Burevestnik respectively.\nThe well-known expatriate Romanian rugby writer, Chris Thau wrote in the late 1980s about Soviet rugby's failure to break into the international mainstream:\nClimate.\nClimate was a particular problem for rugby in the Soviet Union. In 1978, a game in the RSFSR set the record for one of the coldest matches ever to be played. Krasnoyarsk played Polyechika Alma at -23' C. Because Krasnoyarsk had travelled over 2,000 km to be there, the game was not called off. Instead, players resorted to wearing balaclavas, gloves, and several pairs of tracksuits to combat the cold. The extreme climate of the former USSR remains a problem in many regions, with winter sometimes being a split season, or the game of snow rugby being played.\nMany parts of the region spend a large part of the year under a blanket of snow. In northern parts of the USSR, most open ground was permafrost, leading to further problems with pitches, especially with the placement of goalposts. Other regions such as Soviet Central Asia often had desert climates, leading to temperature extremes, and water shortages for the pitch.\nGoverning bodies and administration.\nLike almost everything else in the USSR, rugby was ultimately answerable to the Soviet government, albeit through a number of different channels. Officially, the Rugby Federation of the USSR (RFUSSR; sometimes translated as the \"Rugby Union of the Soviet Union\") was the top governing body of Soviet rugby and centrally controlled. However, as a Soviet organisation, it was in fact part of a complex web of administrations, bureaucracies and so on, and linked to the Soviet government rather than being an independent body on the lines of the major rugby nations. The RFUSSR was answerable to, and funded by the USSR Committee on Physical Culture and Sport which was the umbrella organisation for all Soviet sport, and this in turn was attached to the USSR Council of Ministers.\nIn reality, Soviet rugby operated under two or three different systems, which more or less ran in parallel, and only one of which was directly related to rugby:\nLastly, there was the CSKA (Central Army Sports Club), which administered rugby in garrisons throughout the Soviet Union and was centrally rather than nationally controlled. For children, there were the Sports schools (ДЮСШ), but these tended to concentrate more on Olympic sports, and neglected rugby.\nEquipment and amenities came from the state's Glavsportprom, and the state sports publishing agency was Sovetsky Sport. Dinamo was the biggest sports manufacturer, and had many retail sports shops; its profits were ploughed back into the organisation.\nThe RFUSSR was founded in 1936, and re-established in 1968, the Rugby Federation of the USSR was founded. Over the years, the various rugby unions of each of the SSRs were set up - most of the national governing bodies of the Soviet successor states can trace themselves back to these.\nIn the latter years of the USSR, Soviet rugby also affiliated to two international bodies. In 1975, the RFUSSR became a member of FIRA-AER, which was then the largest rugby governing body in the world. This was followed, just over a decade later by membership of the International Rugby Football Board.\nHistory.\nIn the first half of the 20th century, Soviet citizens endured the brunt of two world wars, two revolutions (1905 &amp; 1917), a devastating Civil War, and a number of famines. In addition, there was some severe political repression, notably the Great Purge in the 1930s, which led to many people being sent to the Gulag. It is understandable that under such circumstances, a team sport such as rugby could not flourish and was low on the list of people's priorities. Only with the less repressive regime of the post-Stalin period did Soviet rugby begin to establish a firm base.\nIndigenous football codes.\nThe Soviet Union had a number of different indigenous football codes, some of which bore a resemblance to rugby. Amongst these were lelo burti (Georgia), shvalyga (Russia and the Ukraine), and kila. (Russia and the Ukraine), aimtskachara (Abkhazia),and various forms of buzkashi also existed in Soviet Central Asia.\nIntroduction of rugby.\nRugby football in the Russian Empire pre-dated the Russian Revolution by a number of years, but it was only played sporadically. It appears to have been the first (non-indigenous) football code to be played in Russia, around a decade before the introduction of association football. Mr Hopper, a Scotsman, who worked in Moscow arranged a match in the 1880s; the first soccer match was in 1892. In 1886, however, the Russian police clamped down on rugby because they considered it \"brutal, and liable to incite demonstrations and riots\" Condemnation by the tsar's police probably deterred many people from playing, and records of rugby over the next thirty years are sparse. Some rugby union was still being played in 1908.\nThe first official match, played in Moscow, did not take place until 1923 several years after the Revolution, and in the same year, the first formal rugby teams in the USSR were organised by M.S. Koslov (М. С. Козлов), A.A. Markushevich (А. А. Маркушевич), A.V. Pravdin (А. В. Правдин), N.Ia. Kolli (Н. Я. Колли) and others.\nGiven the vast area of the USSR, and its complex and turbulent history, it seems more likely that rugby had multiple introductions and reintroductions to various regions completely independent of one another.\nFor example, it seems that rugby was introduced to Georgia independently of its introduction to Russia, and moreover, the game bears a distinct resemblance to a pre-existing Georgian folk sport known as \"lelo\". There were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce rugby into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928.\nEarly history.\nAmongst Bolsheviks, there were two main schools of thought when it came to sports planning and debate - the Proletkul'tists and the Hygienists:\nThe Hygienists thought sport implied competition (which communism was supposed to oppose) and was injurious to health. They favoured:\nThe Hygienists did not like team sports, but preferred athletics, swimming and rowing - as long as they were solo events against the clock, or one's previous best. The Hygienists had control over the Supreme Council of Physical Culture (the government sports body), most of the sporting press, the Ministry of Health, and physical education colleges. Moreover, they excluded PE from schools, and by extension team sports, arguing that \"the existence of physical education teachers is a sign of pedagogical illiteracy.\"\nThe Proletkul'tists considered sport bourgeois, and preferred mass displays and folk sports, and their influence persisted around a decade after the Revolution. As a result Soviet sport during the 1920s tended to be fairly isolationist, with the exception of the Spartakiad.\nThe promotion of sport gained support from other quarters. For example, in 1926, the Ukrainian Party Central Committee passed a resolution in which they expressed the hope that:\nAlthough nominally a proletkul'tist, the first Soviet People's Commissar of Enlightenment responsible for culture and education, Anatoly Vasilyevich Lunacharsky (Анатолий Васильевич Луначарский - 1875-1933) had other ideas. He was one of the early Russian rugby enthusiasts, and \"called for a careful study of foreign sporting experience and the inclusion of everything worthwhile into Soviet sport, particularly boxing and rugby.\" Lunacharsky was one of the most genuinely cosmopolitan and intellectual of the early Bolsheviks, and a prolific writer on all kinds of cultural and leisure activity from the \"high\" arts to sports, and was a significant contributor to \"физикультура и спорт\" (\"Fizkul'tura i sport\"), the leading Soviet sports magazine of the time. However, Lunacharsky received some opposition from some others within the \"Proletkult\" movement, as James Riordan points out:\nIn his book, \"Thoughts on Sport\", Lunacharsky hardly allayed this charge, saying:\nLunacharsky would later die in France (coincidentally at Menton, where William Webb Ellis was buried), and had the honour of being buried in the Kremlin Wall Necropolis. In the 1930s, his works were banned, and would not appear again until the late 1950s, when he was rehabilitated and seen as one of the most open-minded and forward thinking of the Russian Revolutionaries.\nSoviet rugby might have had a much higher profile in the pre-war period if Lunarcharsky had lived a few years longer. But judging by what happened to his writings, it is unlikely that Lunarcharsky could have avoided Stalin's purges - and would have ended up dead or in a prison camp.\n1930s.\nThere was a close link-up between Soviet sport and the military, as the USSR felt itself to be hemmed in by unfriendly states. GTO (\"Gotov k trudu i oborone\") - Ready for defence and labour - was the name of the national fitness programme, which was established in 1931.\nAfter the end of the Civil War, rugby began to take root. Rugby was introduced into several secondary schools and colleges in 1926, and again in 1932.\nIn 1934, two teams played an exhibition match in Moscow initiating the Moscow Championship, and matches were being played in a number of other Soviet cities. According to Victor and Jennifer Louis,\nIn October, 1935, Moscow played Minsk, and won 6-0.\nThe first Soviet Championship took place in 1936, and there was another in 1939. In 1937, there was an unofficial All-Union competition in which two Moscow based teams played ones from Minsk and Gorky.\nIn 1938, the USSR Cup was held, and Dynamo Moscow won.\nAn ongoing problem in the 1930s was a lack of proper facilities and equipment. The games also did not receive sufficient publicity to generate a public interest, so that the Soviet authorities large gave up in their effort until after the Stalinist period.\n1940s.\nPlay continued at a low level during the 1940s, but the games were one-offs, and were non-championship.\nAttempts to establish rugby in Georgia took place in 1940 and in 1947.\nThe only two tournaments were held in Tbilisi (1947) and Kyiv (1949). Even in Moscow only 3 rugby clubs continue to play and slowly disband.\nIn 1949, rugby union was forbidden throughout the USSR during the \"fight against cosmopolitanism\". [mostly untrue, but would have suffered persecution]\n1950: Post-Stalin era.\nSoviet teams once more began to be formed in the late 1950s, and the game underwent a renaissance, thanks to the efforts of B.M. Egupov (Б. М. Егупов), G.G. Mrelashvili (Г. Г. Мрелашвили) and A.A. Sorokin (А. А. Сорокин). This is the same period in which the rugby advocate Lunacharsky was rehabilitated, and his writings were released from censorship.\nCompetition was resumed in 1957-58, after a \"complete absence of 10 years\".\nLlanelli toured Czechoslovakia and the USSR in the 1950s. In 1957, led by Rhys Williams, Llanelli played in the final of the World Youth Games in Moscow. Llanelli lost to the Romanian side Grivita Rosie. It was a game marred by such \"hideous and appalling violence\" that it hindered the development of the game in Russia for a number of years.\nThe Moscow Civil Guard were called out as a result of the brawl between Llanelli and Bucharest.\nRugby was reintroduced to Georgia by Jacques Haspekian, an Armenian man from Marseilles in France who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseilles, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nThe very first rugby session was held on October 15, 1959 in Tbilisi, at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as \"Qochebi\".\n1960s.\nAlong with the revival in the late 1950s, rugby received another boost in the 1960s, when Soviet industry started to manufacture its own equipment. The 1960s saw massive Soviet investment in sport - for example, while between 1953 and 1964, the government spent an average of 16 million rubles per year, in 1965, it spent no less than 40 million. In August 1966, the Soviet government drew up a spending plan, which resulted in some republics increasing their sports spending by as much as 6 or 7 times. In the Russian RFSR, in 1967, the expenditure was more than double the amount spent in all the post-war years put together.\nSerious efforts to organise the sport took place in the early 1960s, when championships were held between clubs, and the Soviet Championship recommenced in 1966. The decade was a golden age for, with a large number of new teams being set up in many parts of the Soviet Union, including areas such as Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. A school for coaches was opened during this period, and physical training colleges throughout the USSR introduced lectures on rugby union as part of their courses. The students of the MHTS in Moscow were also a major force in the promotion of the game.\nIn 1967, rugby was introduced to Moldavia.\nIn the 1960s too, Soviet rugby started to reach out, often without hope of immediate success, to international competition in order to acquire experience. The Soviet international team played their first match against a foreign side in 1960, when they played a Polish side.\nNational organisations.\nIn the 1960s, a number of the national bodies were set up, such as Lithuania's in 1961, Latvia's in 1963, Georgia's 1964, and Russia's in 1966.\nIn 1968, the Rugby Federation of the USSR was founded.\n1970s.\nIn 1974, there were 10,000 registered Soviet rugby players, including more than 200 Soviet Masters of Sport. In the same year, twenty teams took part in the national championships. Notable Soviet players of this period included B.P. Gavrilov (Б. П. Гаврилов), A.G. Grigor'iants (А. Г. Григорьянц) and I.I. Kiziriia (И. И. Кизирия), all of whom were Masters of Sport.\nIn 1973, Moscow Slava RFC toured Wales. After a game in which Slava played Rhymney RFC, and lost 10-8, there was some banter in the bar -\nIn 1975, the Soviet national team played their first ever match.\nIn 1977, James Riordan was able to predict,\nAt the time, this was not bad prognostication; however, political and economic factors within the Eastern Bloc in the 1980s ensured this was not to be.\nThe former All Black scrum half Chris Laidlaw, writing at the end of the 1970s, saw rugby as a positive force in east-west relations at the time:\nChris Laidlaw writing of the open secret of shamateurism in Soviet sport said:\n1980s.\nA notable Russian player of the 1980s was Igor Mironov who played for the Barbarians several times during the period.\nThe \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" states that \"all Socialist countries\" in Europe played rugby during this period.\nSoviet Rugby was beginning to emerge as a significant presence on the world stage. Soviet delegates were amongst those who went to the centenary congress of the International Rugby Football Board in 1986. Soviet women did not make much headway into team sport, especially rugby, until the advent of \"perestroika\".\nThe USSR supposedly turned down its invitation to the 1987 Rugby World Cup, because of its distaste for the \"apartheid\" regime of South Africa. However, South Africa was not invited in the end. While the \"Great Soviet Encyclopedia\" states that rugby is popular in Great Britain, New Zealand, France, Romania and Australia, it tellingly makes no mention of South Africa. Chris Thau says that France approached the USSR before 1987 on the issue, and that the Soviets said that they would be happy to participate if South Africa was not invited. In the end, South Africa was not invited, but the USSR did not attend either. It has been said that:\nThe Soviets leaned on other nations heavily:\nIn 1988, Edgard Taturian, the Soviet director of rugby coaching, said in an outspoken interview that the USSR required ten times as many coaches and referees as it had. He admitted that a more holistic approach was needed:\nCrawley RFC was due to tour Russia in early 1980s, and had both raised funds, and gained approval from the Soviet Embassy. However, they received a stern letter from the Rugby Football Union telling them that \"you're not big enough or good enough.\" They toured country only in 1989.\nA running joke in French rugby circles ran that FIRA's nightmare was to have \" playing refereed by a Soviet.\"\nSome members of the were also veterans at this point - for example, Igor Mironov, Roman Khairulin and Alexander Tikonov had all been playing at international level for over a decade. Igor Frantsusov, the scrum-half had been playing for slightly less time, but was still a veteran in rugby terms.\nBreak up of Soviet Union.\nThe collapse of the Soviet Union was a severe blow to rugby in the region, which resulted in the removal of state subsidies, and forced many of the smaller clubs to dissolve or start afresh. In the case of Russia, the two main centres, Moscow and Siberia were thousands of miles apart. Georgia was one of the few places with a large number of clubs remaining, partly because it had become popular there, and its league was based in a relatively compact area.\nWhile the USSR's dissolution was ongoing, in 1990 the Soviet rugby team visited Ireland and the United States for the first time. In this period, the Soviet Union women's national rugby union team played for the first time, and enjoyed a brief existence. \nThe Soviet Union did not take part in the qualification rounds for the 1991 Rugby World Cup - European qualification. The 1991 Rugby World Cup coincided with the final stages of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The RWC itself took place in October and November 1991, around two months after the unsuccessful coup d'état attempt against Gorbachev, which is often seen as being the end of the Soviet Union. In November 1991, Boris Yeltsin issued a decree banning the CPSU throughout the Russian republic.\nAs a stopgap measure, the former USSR competed under the Commonwealth of Independent States banner, this arrangement terminating in 1992. The side played four matches before its dissolution.\nThe most successful \"successor\" rugby team has been that of Georgia, which competed in the 2003 Rugby World Cup, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In 2007, they nearly upset Ireland, missing out on a potential winning try late in the match, and defeated Namibia 30-0. In 2011, they had a respectable performance against Scotland, losing 15–6, defeated Romania 25–9. No other ex-Soviet nation other than Georgia and Russia has ever qualified for the Rugby World Cup.\nRussia remains to date the next most successful team after Georgia, participating in the 2011 Rugby World Cup; however, the rest of the former USSR has not fared so well. A notable exception was the Latvian rugby union sevens team which succeeded in reaching the Rugby World Cup Sevens in 1993. This surprised the international rugby community, as at the time there were only two rugby pitches in the entire country. There are some other notable exceptions, e.g. the Ukraine who were able to call on the services of Igor Bokov the former Soviet coach.\nThe era also brought a new challenge in the form of rugby league. Although rugby league in England had traditionally played on its working class credentials, in the Soviet Union it had been seen as a bourgeois pursuit, due to its links with business through professionalism. When the Soviet Union collapsed, rugby league tried to buy out Russian rugby union. A notable defector was RC Lokomotiv, the former train workers club in Moscow.\nIn the mid-1990s, Russia had 222 clubs, and 6,000 players spread out across the entire country [rather speculative and untrue figure]; Georgia had 40 clubs; the Ukraine had 20 clubs and 750 players; Latvia had only 8 clubs; and Lithuania had 14 clubs;\nPopularity.\nAlthough such tournaments as the Soviet Cup and the Soviet Championship existed, rugby never reached its full potential in the Soviet Union. Of the two Rugby codes, Rugby union was the more popular; Rugby league only attracting fans and athletes after the collapse of Communism.\nVictor and Jennifer Louis wrote in 1980 that:\nChris Thau identified two major problems hindering the spread rugby in the late Soviet Union:\nHowever, by 1989 Rugby was well-established across the Eastern bloc. Since the dissolution of the USSR, Rugby has become particularly popular in Georgia, where it is the de facto national sport.\nAfter the Second World War, there was competition with the west and not just in sport. From the late 1950s-early 1970s, there was a reduction in Soviet people's work time, which caused an increase in their leisure time. Sport was seen as:\nWith this in mind, participation in sport was strongly encouraged from the grass roots level upwards.\nIn 1926, 18% of the Soviet population lived in towns, but by 1978, this had risen to 63% (164 million) Each new planned town included a sports centre.\nThe 1930s saw the\nThe Soviet government spent 12,600 million rubles on sport and health each year in the 1970s and 1980s, which was approximately 0.03% of the state budget.\nRather like their Olympic counterparts, Soviet rugby players had a fair degree of shamateurism. Both the Olympics and rugby union were officially amateur, but this was not really the case. For example, the Dinamo clubs were sponsored and financed by the KGB, but no one could say that openly that some athletes were full-time shamateurs, and received bonuses for winning including dollars. Masters of Sport were full time, and paid by their sports society. They received 180 rubles each year, plus 30-40 rubles if they were capped for the USSR team paid for by the USSR sports committee. There were frequently unofficial bonuses, and some people could be Masters of Sport for life, meaning that they would receive pay long after their retirement.\nDomestic competition.\nNational champions included teams from the sports clubs of the Moscow Higher Technical School (МВТУ), the Iu. A. Gagarin Air Force Academy (ВВА им. Ю. А. Гагарина; the future VVA-Podmoskovye Monino), and Fili (\"Фили\").\nThe two largest and most successful sports clubs were the Central House of the Red Army (the Central Sports Club of the Army, TSSK), and Динамо (Dinamo/Dynamo - the security services).\nBetween 1961 and 1974, the Soviet team took part in more than 100 international matches.\nNational team.\nThe USSR side consisted of representatives of all constituent republics within the Soviet Union.\nThey played their first game against a Polish team in 1960.\nThe FIRA Trophy 1974-1997.\nThere was also a women's team, but they only played several games.\nhttp://www.fira-aer-rugby.com/forum2007/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=3186&amp;hilit=\nhttp://www.rugby.by/"

        "text": "Derrick Lee Morgan (born January 6, 1989) is an American former football linebacker who played in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons with the Tennessee Titans. He was selected 16th overall by the Titans in the 2010 NFL draft after playing college football at Georgia Tech.\nHigh school career.\nMorgan was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He attended Coatesville Area High School in Coatesville, Pennsylvania, where he played for the Red Raiders football team. As a senior he was named league Defensive Player of the Year and first-team All-State after recording 47 tackles and 7 sacks at the defensive end position. He also rushed for 523 yards and 8 touchdowns as a running back.\nCollege career.\nMorgan attended the Georgia Institute of Technology from 2007 to 2009, playing for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets of the Atlantic Coast Conference. As a true freshman in 2007 he appeared in 12 of 13 games, recording 9 tackles as a reserve defensive end. The following year as a sophomore he started all 13 games, contributing 51 tackles and 7 sacks while earning an honorable mention All-ACC selection. As a junior in 2009, Morgan was named ACC Defensive Player of the Year and earned first-team All-American honors from \"Associated Press\", \"Pro Football Weekly\", and \"Scout.com\". He finished the season with 55 tackles (including 18.5 for a loss) and 12.5 sacks while helping his team to a conference championship. After his junior year, Morgan decided to enter the 2010 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nAll values from NFL Combine.\nTennessee Titans.\nMorgan was selected 16th overall by the Tennessee Titans in the 2010 NFL Draft. He signed a six-year contract on July 31, 2010, which also included playing time incentives that later voided the final year. He signed a second contract (4-year, $30 million) with the Titans on March 13, 2015, after fielding interest from multiple teams as a free agent.\nMorgan played at the 4–3 defensive end position his first four seasons with the Titans, then switched to outside linebacker in 2014 as part of the team's transition to a 3–4 defense. Morgan became a starter on the Titans defense during the 2011 season.\nMorgan wore the uniform number 90 until changing to 91 prior to the start of the 2012 season.\n2010 season.\nMorgan played in the 2010 season opener, registering a sack in his first NFL game. He suffered a torn left ACL during the fourth game, however, ending his rookie season.\n2011 season.\nMorgan made his first NFL start on the seventh game of the 2011 season and remained a starter for the rest of the year. He led the team with 20 quarterback pressures. During the preseason he had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee but missed only the first regular season game.\n2012 season.\nIn 2012, Morgan led the Titans with 6.5 sacks and 19 quarterback pressures while starting all 16 games. Pro Football Focus ranked him as the league's fourth best 4-3 defensive end.\n2013 season.\nMorgan was second on the Titans with 6 sacks in 2013.\n2014 season.\nDuring his first year at linebacker in 2014, Morgan led the Titans with 6.5 sacks while starting all 16 games. He also set career highs in tackles (82), quarterback pressures (26), tackles for loss (13), passes defensed (9), and forced fumbles (2). He was rated as the eighth-best 3-4 outside linebacker by Pro Football Focus.\n2015 season.\nMorgan had a notable start to the 2015 season, recording 4.5 sacks in the first four games. During the sixth game he suffered a shoulder injury, however. He played through the injury the next four games, then was shut down for the rest of the season. He had surgery on December 15 to repair a torn left labrum.\n2016 season.\nMorgan registered a team-high 56 quarterback pressures and career-high 9.0 sacks in 2016. The 9.0 sacks tied him for ninth highest in the AFC.\n2017 season.\nMorgan tallied a career-high 59 quarterback pressures in 2017. His 7.5 sacks was the second-best season total of his career.\n2018 season.\nIn 2018, Morgan played in 13 games with 12 starts, recording 25 tackles, three pass deflections, and a career-low 0.5 sacks. He missed three games due to knee and shoulder injuries.\nRetirement.\nOn July 15, 2019, Morgan announced his retirement from the NFL after nine seasons. He finished his career with 44.5 sacks, sixth all-time in Titans history (including the Houston Oilers era) at the time of his retirement.\nMedical cannabis advocacy.\nMorgan has spoken publicly about the medicinal properties of cannabis that he believes could benefit NFL players, particularly in treating and preventing the serious brain injuries and diseases that have afflicted many players. Morgan has called on the NFL to conduct research on the neuroprotective benefits of cannabis, as part of the league's stated commitment to making player health and safety issues a top priority. Morgan has also donated money to help fund medical cannabis research.\nMorgan follows the lead of Eugene Monroe, who in March 2016 became the first active NFL player to openly advocate for the league to change its cannabis policy. Morgan and Monroe appeared together in a June 2016 interview with Katie Couric, the first time Morgan had spoken on the subject.\nIn November 2016, the NFL Player's Association announced the formation of a committee to study issues of pain management among players, including the use of cannabis as treatment.

        "title": "Tom Evans (rugby union)",
        "text": "Thomas Henry Evans (31 December 1882 - 19 March 1955) was a Welsh international rugby union flanker who played club rugby for Llanelli. Evans played in eighteen international games for Wales, and in 1908 was part of the Welsh team that faced touring Australian team. Evans played in four Home Nations Championships, from 1906 to 1909, and the first two Five Nations Championships, in 1910 and 1911; playing in three Triple Crown winning seasons.\nRugby career.\nBorn in Ammanford, Carmarthenshire; Evans was a Police Sergeant by occupation, and was described as being 'as strong as an ox' and 'unusually fleet of foot'. He first played rugby for local club team Ammanford RFC. A rugby talent at a young age, Evans was given the captaincy of the Ammanford senior team during the 1902/03 season; while only 19. Before his first international cap, Evans had switched from his local club side to Llanelli, the premier team from the west of Wales.\nEvans made his first international appearance for Wales in the final game of the 1906 Home Nations Championship. Wales had won the previous years Championship, and with victories already established over England and Scotland, a win against Ireland in the last encounter would give the country back-to-back Triple Crown seasons. Three changes were made to the team for the trip to Belfast, all in the forward positions and all three new caps; Evans and two Cardiff players, Dai Westacott and Jack Powell. The game ended in a disappointing loss for Wales, with poor selection decisions blamed. All three new caps found the strains of international rugby too much, and failed to last the pace.\nDespite a poor debut, Evans was reselected for the next season's Championship, playing in all three matches. Wales finished second in the tournament, losing only one game, against eventual champions Scotland. Evans missed the majority of the 1908 season, joining the team for the final game of the Championship in an away win over Ireland. Although Evans played but a single match of the tournament, Wales won all three games of the 1908 Championship, making Evans a Triple Crown winning player for the first time in his career.\nThe 1908/09 season was the pinnacle of Evans' playing career, at club and country level. The season saw the arrival of the very first touring Australian national team. The Wallabies, as the Australian team was nicknamed, had faced eight club and county teams, winning each match without too much resistance. Llanelli were the ninth opponents, and the game was played at Stradey Park on 17 October. Although records state that Evans was not given the captaincy of Llanelli until the next season, he was given the honour of captaining the team for the game against the Australians. Llanelli won the game 8-3, the first loss of the tour for the Australians and the first win over one of three big Southern Hemisphere international teams for Llanelli. Evans not only led his team that day, but also scored the winning try; and was reported to have crossed the line with three Wallabies clinging on to him in a bid to bring him down. Almost two months later Evans was part of the Wales squad to face the same touring Australians, joined in the pack by fellow Llanelli team-mate James Watts. Wales won by a narrow 9-6 scoreline. The Australian tour match was followed by the 1909 Home Nations Championship, the final tournament before the inclusion of the French team made the competition the Five Nations Championship. Evans played in all three Championship games, plus an early encounter with France, which all resulted in wins for the Wales team, giving Evans his second Triple Crown.\nThe 1909/10 season saw Evans given the club captaincy of Llanelli, and he retained his place in the Welsh international team. The Welsh run of 11 games unbeaten ended during the 1910 Five Nations Championship, with defeat away to England at Twickenham. Although Wales won the remaining three games, they could only finish second in the table to England. Evans' final Championship came in 1911, again selected for the full tournament, Evans was part of his third and final Triple Crown team, plus the first official Grand Slam victory. His final international match was played at the Cardiff Arms Park in Cardiff, in the 1911 Championship decider, against Ireland. In the 16-0 win, Evans scored his first and only international points, with one of three Welsh tries. Evans had played a total of 18 games for his country over a six-season period, finishing on the losing side on only three occasions.\nInternational matches played.\nWales"

Derbyshire's matches were not considered to be first class in this season. The club had lost first class status after 1887 and did not regain it until 1894, the year before they joined the County Championship. However many of the players competed for the club earlier or subsequently at first-class level.\n1891 season.\nDerbyshire played twelve games, all against sides that they had played in first class matches before 1888 or that joined the County Championship four years later. Sydney Evershed took over the captaincy from Fred Spofforth who made his one last appearance during the year. William Chatterton was top scorer making a century against Yorkshire. George Davidson topped the bowling with 61 wickets.\nWilliam Taylor noted that during Derbyshire's period in exile many fine players wore their colours including S H Evershed, who in captained the eleven with marked ability for many years and the grand veteran, Levi Wright – \"a magnificent batsman and unsurpassed as a fieldsman in the oldfashioned position of square-point\". With Evershed, and his brother Edward, William Eadie and Robert Tomlinson, the team was well represented by brewers of Burton."

        "text": "Harry E. Chapman (October 26, 1885 – October 21, 1918) was a professional baseball player. He played all or part of five seasons in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Terriers, and St. Louis Browns, primarily as a catcher. He saw the majority of his action as a backup backstop for the Terriers in the Federal League.\nEarly career.\nChapman played minor league baseball in the Central Kansas League. He made his major league debut on October 6, 1912, the final game of the Chicago Cubs' season, and went 1-for-4 with a triple and an RBI. On December 15 that offseason, Chapman was traded by the Cubs, along with Grover Lowdermilk and future Hall of Famer Joe Tinker, to the Cincinnati Reds for five players. Chapman, however, played with the minor-league Atlanta Crackers for much of 1913. He made two pinch-hitting appearances for the Reds that season, singling and striking out.\nFederal League.\nThe catcher was one of many MLB players to jump to the upstart Federal League in 1914, signing with the St. Louis Terriers. He played with them for both seasons of their existence, backing up Mike Simon and Grover Hartley. In 1914, Chapman hit .210 in 64 games with two doubles, a triple, and 14 RBI. In 1915, Chapman had the experience of playing for the league champions and had a somewhat more successful season himself, hitting .199 in 62 games with six doubles, three triples, one home run, and 29 RBI. His home run, the only such hit of his career, came off Baltimore's George Suggs.\nLater career.\nJust before the dissolution of the Federal League, the St. Louis Browns purchased Chapman's rights from the Terriers. However, his time with the Browns resulted in numbers well below his career averages, as Chapman hit just .097 (3 for 31) in 18 games with no extra-base hits or RBI. He played his final major league game in July 1916, and spent the last two seasons of his career toiling for the Little Rock Travelers of the Southern Association, playing a career-high 131 games in 1917.\nChapman died at age 30 in Nevada, Missouri, October 21, 1918, from influenza-induced pneumonia, a victim of the Spanish flu.\nChapman was one of eight Major League Baseball players known either to have been killed or died from illness while serving in the armed forces during World War I. The others were Alex Burr‚ Larry Chappell‚ Harry Glenn, Eddie Grant‚ Newt Halliday, Ralph Sharman and Bun Troy."

Jeremy Wariner had won the previous two world championships in the open 400 metres, but lost his title a few days earlier. He had something to prove, flying through the turn, Wariner put the USA into the lead by the break. After he passed Yon Soriano on the inside, Soriano accelerated to challenge Wariner for the pole position. Warner held the pole, behind Soriano, Ben Offereins was able to sneak Australia into third while Michael Bingham was being challenged by Piotr Klimczak for Poland. Bingham was able to get around Thomas and then Soriano, putting Great Britain into a solid second place by the straightaway, but Wariner was running away from the pack. Soriano paid for his exuberance and slowed down the home stretch as all the other teams passed him by the exchange. Warner had opened up a 15-metre gap, the USA had completed their exchange before the other teams arrived. Because of the change in positions, Bingham had to cross in front of several teams to make their exchange, and Kévin Borlée ran Belgium from last to fourth on the straight. Kerron Clement for USA and far behind him Robert Tobin for Great Britain had clear sailing, behind them Australia and Belgium came out of the exchange best. Tobin ran conservatively down the backstretch while Tristan Thomas accelerated to go around him on the turn. Coming off the turn, Tobin regained second position and was gaining on Clement. USA had new world champion LaShawn Merritt on the anchor he immediately started widening the gap on Martyn Rooney for Britain. Australia's Sean Wroe had a significant gap on Belgium, while Yannick Fonsat brought France from dead last to almost even with Belgium at the exchange. As Merritt kept widening the gap, Wroe was gaining on Rooney coming off the turn Wroe was perfectly positioned to punch for the silver medal position, but Rooney held him off, looking back to be sure he was holding clear.

        "title": "2009 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2009 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the NRL's 2009 Telstra Premiership season. Played on 4 October 2009 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium was contested between the Parramatta Eels and the Melbourne Storm, the latter competing in their 4th grand final in a row. That was later stripped from them for breaking the salary cap rule. It was also the first Grand Final to feature the two referee system, with Shayne Hayne and Tony Archer being the first referees to jointly officiate in an NRL Grand Final.\nThe Melbourne Storm led 10–0 at halftime and fought off a Parramatta comeback to eventually win 23–16 and claim their third premiership since entering the competition. This title was later stripped from the club due to salary cap breaches. Melbourne went on to defeat the Leeds Rhinos, winners of the 2009 Super League Grand Final, in the 2010 World Club Challenge. The latter title was also stripped from the Melbourne club.\nBackground.\nThe 2009 NRL season was the 102nd season of professional rugby league football club competition in Australia, and the twelfth run by the National Rugby League. For the third consecutive year, sixteen teams competed for the 2009 Telstra Premiership title. The season commenced with the first match played on 13 March and ended with the grand final, played on 4 October. The second season of the National Youth Competition also commenced in line with the Telstra Premiership.\nMelbourne Storm.\nThe Melbourne Storm finished the regular season in 4th position with 14 wins, nine losses and one draw. As the minor premiers of the last three seasons and premiers in 2007, some commentators believed that the Melbourne side were below their best in 2009 and doubted they would make a 4th straight grand final. But in the first week of the finals series they easily accounted for the defending premiers, the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, with a 40 – 12 victory. They then defeated the 2006 premiers, the Brisbane Broncos, 40 – 10 to qualify for the grand final. The Melbourne Storm are the first side to make four consecutive grand finals since the Parramatta side did so in 1981–84.\nMelbourne five-eighth Brett Finch had a chance to break his premiership drought by defeating the side that terminated his contract in April 2009 when coach Daniel Anderson said he was not wanted at the Parramatta club.\nParramatta Eels.\nAfter a dreadful first half of the season and languishing in 14th position, the Parramatta Eels won 9 of their last 12 games to finish 8th and just make the finals. In the first three weeks of the finals series they defeated the top three teams of the home and away season – minor premiers the St. George Illawarra Dragons, the Gold Coast Titans, and arch-rivals the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs. The last time the Parramatta club made the grand final was 2001 where they were defeated by the Newcastle Knights and the last time they won the premiership was in 1986. They were the first team to come from 8th position to make the NRL Grand Final and if they had won they would have been the first team ever ranked below 6th to win the premiership. Canterbury's appearance in the 1998 grand final came from 9th position, but under a different finals system.\nParramatta Eels fullback and Dally M Medallist Jarryd Hayne was in danger of missing the match after being placed on report for sliding in with his knees out to stop a try and connecting with the head of Canterbury winger Bryson Goodwin. The incident was reviewed by the NRL Match Review Panel on 27 September and Hayne received a grade one sentence, allowing him to play. This set up one of the great grand final match-ups as Hayne played opposite current Melbourne and Australian fullback and 2008 Golden Boot Winner Billy Slater.\nParramatta captain Nathan Cayless was under an injury cloud after he strained his hamstring in the preliminary final. He passed an intense fitness test on the day before the game to take his place in the grand final. Cayless, Luke Burt and Nathan Hindmarsh went into the match as the only remaining survivors from the club's 2001 Grand Final loss to the Newcastle Knights.\nThe two sides faced each other once in the regular season in round 19. Parramatta won 18–16 at Parramatta Stadium on 20 July.\nSchedule.\nThe 2009 NRL Grand Final featured pre-match entertainment by the Grammy award-winning Australian rock band Wolfmother while Irish band The Script performed their latest hit \"Before the Worst\" at halftime. 2008 Australian Idol winner Wes Carr performed a tribute to the elite club of players who have played 300 Premiership games, while the game's retiring players were farewelled. Prior to kick-off the Child Flight helicopter and members of the game's \"300 Club\" delivered the Telstra Premiership Trophy to ANZ Stadium.\nMatch details.\n1st Half\nMelbourne's Ryan Hoffman broke Parramatta's line to score the first try of the game in the fifth minute to make the score 6–0. Parramatta was looking shaky in the first half, and Melbourne capitalised with a try to Adam Blair in the 24th minute, set up by a Cooper Cronk line-break, to make the score 10–0, which would be the half-time score.\n2nd Half\nParramatta scored early in the second half, with Eric Grothe, Jr., scoring in the 45th minute to bring the scoreline to 10–6. Melbourne responded quickly, with tries to Greg Inglis off a bomb kick in the 49th minute and Billy Slater from a line break in the 56th minute, to open a handy 22–6 lead heading into the final quarter of the game. Parramatta attacked through the final quarter of the game, then broke through for two tries: one to Joel Reddy off a bomb kick in the 70th minute, then a barnstorming run from Fuifui Moimoi off an off-load in the 72nd minute; only the former of these tries was converted, bringing the score to 22–16. In the 76th minute, with Melbourne attacking from their own half, Billy Slater dropped the ball as he tried to play it. Referee Tony Archer signaled a penalty for Melbourne. It was initially thought that Archer had penalised Fuifui Moimoi for stripping the ball from Slater in the tackle, even though both of Moimoi's arms were still wrapped around Slater's legs, but it was later revealed he had penalised Moimoi for holding on to Slater, not for a strip. Greg Inglis scored a field goal in the ensuing set-of-six, extending the margin to 23–16 in the 79th minute. Melbourne would hold on to win by that score.\nClive Churchill Medal\nMelbourne fullback Billy Slater was judged by Australian selectors Bob McCarthy, Bob Fulton, Les Geeves and Des Morris to be awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for man of the match. Slater became the first fullback since Bronco Darren Lockyer in the 2000 NRL Grand Final to win the prestigious award. Slater became the third Storm player to win the Churchill Medal, after Brett Kimmorley (1999) and Greg Inglis (2007).\nSome commentators felt that Slater did not deserve the award, suggesting other Melbourne teammates such as halfback Cooper Cronk, citing Cronk's stats which included two try assists to Slater's one, 24 tackles and 16 kicks for 529 metres, dwarfing the combined 387 metres booted by the Eels' Jarryd Hayne (226) and Jeff Robson (161). Upon receiving his award, Slater even mentioned \"I feel like I don't deserve to wear it… Cooper Cronk deserved it.\" Despite the criticism, selectors stood by their decision.\nScoreboard.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard /&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard /&gt;\nAudience.\nThe NRL Grand Final is one of the most popular sporting events of Australasia, and the 2009 NRL grand final was played before a sold-out crowd of 82,538 – the largest rugby league crowd at ANZ Stadium in its current configuration – with millions more watching around Australia and the rest of the world.\nNine Network criticism.\nThe Nine Network was criticised on talkback radio, internet blogs, news sites and the Herald Sun newspaper for not broadcasting the post match celebrations, such as the trophy and medal presentations outside of NSW and QLD, the outrage most evident in Melbourne due to Melbourne Storm winning the game, and also due to the large number of Melbourne supporters at the Melbourne Storm function who could not make the trip to Sydney. One point made by viewers was that the post match was broadcast to international viewers but not those in Australian capital cities such as Melbourne or Adelaide."

        "text": "The UAAP Season 72 men's basketball tournament is the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s men's basketball tournament for the 2009–10 season.\nThe Ateneo Blue Eagles qualified for their second consecutive Finals appearance after amassing a 13–1 elimination round record (only loss coming from last-placed UP Fighting Maroons), and beating 2006 Finals opponent UST Growling Tigers in the semifinals. Their opponent, the UE Red Warriors, finished third in the elimination round, and had to defeat the FEU Tamaraws twice in the semifinals in order to qualify. After both teams split the first two games, Ateneo went on to beat UE in Game 3, 71–58, to win their second straight title. Ateneo's Rabeh Al-Hussaini won the Finals MVP honors.\nThe tournament host is Far Eastern University, which led the opening ceremonies on July 11 at the Araneta Coliseum. ABS-CBN UHF channel Studio 23 broadcast all of the games, including the Final Four and Finals.\nPreseason.\nIn two key preseason tournaments, the FEU Tamaraws advanced in the semifinals of both the Nike Summer League and the Filoil Flying V Cup. In the Nike Summer League, the Tamaraws were beaten by 3-time NCAA champions San Beda Red Lions 74–72 in the semifinals en route to their championship. In the Filoil Flying V Cup, the Tamaraws held off fellow UAAP team UE Red Warriors in the final 84–78 to win the championship.\nWith NCAA Season 84 commissioner Joe Lipa at the helm, new rules were set up:\nThose which were retained are:\nLeague president Anton Montinola of Far Eastern University said that the method in breaking ties will use \"common sense\" as the tournament is prolonged by holding unnecessary matches.\nDue to the high demand of tickets for Ateneo-La Salle games, host FEU has devised a way for allocating tickets for fans of the two schools, although the Ateneo-La Salle game will still be a part of a doubleheader, tickets will be sold separately for the Ateneo-La Salle and the following FEU-UE game. The patrons who only have tickets for one game has to watch only the game stated on their tickets and has to leave when the other game is being held. The two-hour gap between the games was to allow Araneta Coliseum personnel to clear the arena for the second game.

FEU made its return for the second time since last year as UST returned from the playoffs after missing it last year. The De La Salle Green Archers missed the playoffs for the first time in Final Four history after losing to the NU Bulldogs on their last game of the eliminations that ended their streak of Final Four appearance at 14 and were the first runner-up that not to qualify for the semifinals.\nAteneo Blue Eagles.\nThe Eagles opened the season with a win against FEU to begin the defense of their crown. On their second game against UE, they rallied from a 17-point deficit in the first half to win 72-57, and then they demolished UST with Emman Monfort doing the most damage to the Growling Tigers with his 6 treys and a career-high 20 points. However, they were beaten by their Katipunan rivals the UP Fighting Maroons. After that loss, Ateneo is on a winning mode once again as they beat Adamson, NU, and La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a 6-1 win–loss record. During the second round, Ateneo continued their rampage once again highlighted by a win against UP, avenging their only loss for the season and assuring them of the twice to beat advantage in the playoffs. The Eagles completed a sweep of the second round with a victory over the FEU Tamaraws in the elimination round finale, despite FEU leading by as much as 18, as Ateneo chipped the lead and led a late surge to lead at the final buzzer to deny the Tamaraws a #1 seed.\nFEU Tamaraws.\nThe host were beaten by the Ateneo Blue Eagles on opening day but rebounded with a win against last year's runner-up La Salle. The Tamaraws continued their striking distance and rejoining Ateneo in the team standings as the Tamaraws went to an amazing 8-game winning streak. However, they were dealt with their first setback(second overall) in their second round game against UE, but rebounded with wins against Adamson, UP, and La Salle (which needed a win to stay in contention) in overtime, dashing UE's hopes of a twice to beat advantage in the semis, and to set up a virtual game for the #1 seed against Ateneo (FEU had to win by 5 points or more to clinch #1) in the elimination round finale. The Tamaraws were beaten by 1 point after leading as much as 18 that deny a #1 seed and facing the UE Red Warriors anew in the semis.\nUE Red Warriors.\nThe Warriors blew out last year's losing finalist and 2007 finals nemesis La Salle 65-46 but they were demolished by Ateneo on their next game after giving up a 17-point lead in the first half. They rebounded with a win against NU and they lost once again against UST that put them again at .500. UE went on a 2-game winning streak that went into overtimes against Adamson and UP but they lost 2-straight against FEU in the first round finale and Ateneo at the start of the second round. UE swept their last 6 games to have a shot for at least a second twice to beat advantage, as they beat Adamson, FEU (halting the Tamaraws' winning streak at 8), La Salle (extending the Green Archers' losing skid to 5), UP (eliminating the Fighting Maroons in the playoffs), NU and UST. The Warriors got the #3 seed towards the semis, and UE had a twice to win disadvantage against FEU.\nUST Growling Tigers.\nThe Tigers opened the season with 2-straight wins against Adamson and NU but were blown out by Ateneo in their next game. Then they rebounded with a win against UE. UST lost 2-straight against FEU and La Salle that went into double overtime. They ended the first round with a win against a cellar dwelling UP to end with a 4-3 win–loss record and a 3-way tie in the 3rd spot with UE and La Salle in the standings. They opened the second round with another loss to FEU, then they rebounded with a win against UP with the Maroons having a late comeback. UST lost to Ateneo on their next game but won against NU to make sure that they will have a spot at least for the #4 seed. The Tigers went on a 3-game losing skid with a blow out loss to already out Adamson, La Salle (which needed a win to stay in contention), and UE. The Tigers qualified in the semis despite losing its last 3 games of the elimination and also thanks to NU's upset of La Salle early in that day. UST faced Ateneo in the semis.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"Men's bracket\" /&gt;\nSemifinals.\nFEU and Ateneo have the twice-to-beat advantage. They only have to win once, while their opponents, twice, to progress.\nAteneo vs. UST.\nUST hung around early in the game, but due to their turnovers throughout the game, with Eric Salamat making key steals, the Eagles built upon a huge lead with uncontested fastbreak lay-ups, as evidenced by a staggering a field-goal percentage of 50.8%. Jai Reyes scored 17 points, nine from behind the three-point line, to lead the Eagles back into the Finals. Ryan Buenafe added 15 points. Tigers coach Pido Jarencio blamed the loss to poor execution; season MVP Dylan Ababou scored 19 points and grabbed 8 rebounds in a losing effort to cap off his last UAAP game.\nFEU vs. UE.\nPrior to the series being started, FEU co-captain Andy Barroca had come under fire for subpar performances on the last stretch of the eliminations, with accusations of game-fixing hurled against him. Barroca skipped FEU's last practice sessions, and was hurt by the accusations, which ultimately led him to unilaterally drop out of the FEU lineup for the rest of the season. FEU issued a statement prior to the game that Barroca won't play in Game 1 of their series against UE \"with the objective of improving team chemistry,\" an official team statement said.\nGame 1.\nArmed with the twice-to-beat advantage, FEU stayed close with UE, even leading by a point at halftime. Val Acuña scored 11 of his 17 points in the first quarter as UE threatened to pull away. With FEU leading 50–46 late in the third quarter, Paul Lee scored eight consecutive points to close out the quarter with the Red Warriors leading 62–55. Paul Sanga, who had a career-high 22 points, scored a three-pointer to give FEU the lead, but Lee scored 16 of UE's last 18 points, including three consecutive three-pointers, in an 18–5 run that saw the Red Warriors pull ahead late in the fourth quarter. Lee ended the game with a career-high 26 points, together with 8 rebounds and 7 assists. Pari Llagas had a double-double performance to complement Lee's scoring, having 19 points and 12 rebounds.\nGame 2.\nIn the deciding semifinal game, FEU raced to a 27–15 lead in the first quarter, and a 49–39 lead in the second quarter, but lost steam in the second half. The Red Warriors relied on Lee and Pari Llagas, with Llagas scoring two field-goals to put UE up for good 72–70, and Lee scoring four crucial freethrows at the end of the game to seal UE's bid to face Ateneo in the Finals.\nAwards.\nInstitutional awards:\nSponsored awards:\nBroadcast notes.\nStudio 23 carried all games live.

Competitors in this biathlon raced over five loops of a 2.0 kilometre skiing course, shooting twenty times, ten prone and ten standing. Each miss required a competitor to ski a 150-metre penalty loop.\nThe starting order for the pursuit was based on the results of the sprint; the top 60 finishers in that race qualified for the pursuit. In addition, each racer's final deficit behind sprint winner Florence Baverel-Robert corresponded to their starting deficit in the pursuit; Anna Carin Olofsson, who finished 2 seconds behind Fischer in the sprint, started 2 seconds after her in the pursuit.\nThe winner was the first racer over the finish line, Kati Wilhelm. Skiers who were lapped were not ranked in the official results.\nAt the 2005 World Championships, Germany's Uschi Disl successfully defended her four-second lead after the sprint event to win the pursuit, while Russian Olga Pyleva won the event at the 2002 Olympics.

        "text": "The West Coast Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year is an award given to the most outstanding men's basketball player in the West Coast Conference (WCC). The award was first given following the conference's inaugural 1952–53 season, when it was known as the California Basketball Association. The only season in which the award was not presented was the conference's second season of 1953–54. There have been six ties in the award's history, most recently in 2022–23 between Brandin Podziemski of Santa Clara and Drew Timme of Gonzaga. There have also been 13 repeat winners, but only one, Bill Cartwright of San Francisco, has been player of the year three times.\nFour schools in the WCC have dominated the total awards distribution. Before 2000, Pepperdine, San Francisco and Santa Clara had earned the bulk of the awards. Since then, Gonzaga has had the overwhelming majority of selections. In the 23 seasons from 2000–01 to the present, coinciding with the Bulldogs' rise to national prominence, Gonzaga players have won or shared the award 17 times. Gonzaga now claims the most awards with 20 and most individual winners with 18. Santa Clara is second in awards with 12, and its nine individual winners give it a share of second place in that category with Pepperdine. The next closest school, Saint Mary's, has nine awards. One current member has yet to have a winner (Portland)."

The game was also made available for the Nintendo Super System. The SNES version got a worldwide release, while the Genesis version only saw a North American release.\nGameplay.\n\"David Crane's Amazing Tennis\" simulates the men's singles game across three set matches, the game is viewed from behind the player. Clay, grass and hard courts are available, and the player can specify handedness. There are a selection of fictional computer controlled opponents available, each with different strengths, and a two player local multiplayer option is available. Players can perform various shots, such as topspin, backspin, lob and drop shots.\nReception.\nThe game enjoyed a positive critical reception. The presentation was lauded, \"Super Play\" described the impression of a 3D court as \"the most realistic yet for this type of game\", described the sound effects as tremendous, and praised the inclusion of slow motion replays. \"Nintendo Power\" had similar thoughts on the sounds, and found that the \"digitized voice of the scorekeeper and excellent sound effects added to the realism\". \"N-Force\" praised the large and detailed sprites as well as the quality of animation.\nRob Millichamp of \"N-Force\" described the perspective as \"innovative and awesome\", but it was a point of contention between critics. \"Mega\" felt the viewpoint made play confusing and difficult, while \"Super Play\" felt it made seeing where the ball was being served tricky. Both described it as the biggest detriment to the game. A concern shared by many of the critics, was the difficulty in controlling the player on the far side of the court. Due to the viewpoint and perspective of the game, the far side player sprite is significantly smaller compared to the near side player. \"N-Force\" felt this made hitting the ball a nightmare, and \"Super Play\" stated that \"serving and receiving from that end is far too tricky.\"\nDespite the criticism, reviews generally found the game enjoyable. Ed Semrad of \"EGM\" suggested that the game was \"easily one of the best\" tennis games, and \"N-Force\" called it \"an amazing leap forward in tennis sims\". \"Super Play\" concluded that although polished and enjoyable, it was not as good as \"Super Tennis\", a previously released tennis game."

He compiled a record of twenty-five wins, three losses, and two no contests.\nAyers would go on to coach at Winder, Georgia before making his way to Cedartown in 1952. Ayers was a big hit in Cedartown, known for his motivational half time speeches and his ability to get his players fired up before games.\nIn Ayers' time in Cedartown, he would gather a record of ninety one wins, forty three losses, and five no contests. He would capture two region championships, seven sub region championships, and eventually a state championship in 1963. Ayers still holds the all-time record for most wins as a coach at Cedartown. The high school stadium would later be named “Doc” Ayers Memorial Stadium in commemoration to him.\nIn 1964, Ayers would become an assistant coach to Vince Dooley at the University of Georgia where he would coach for seventeen years. “Doc” coached the freshman team and was part of recruiting. While coaching the freshman team, Ayers compiled a record of twenty-eight wins with twelve losses—the best record in Georgia Football History.\nPost coaching.\nAyers was still very involved with the Cedartown football program. Once a week, he made an appearance at the Bulldogs' practice and gave motivational speeches to the team he loved and coached for so many years. \nA charitable golf tournament named the Doc Ayers - Ray Beck golf tournament is held annually in Cedartown. Ayers co- hosted the tournament with Ray Beck at Cherokee Country Club. All the money from the tournament goes to the Polk County Community Foundation. Many former pro football and baseball players attend every year.\nAccomplishments.\nHoward Ayers received many honors including Georgia State Class AAA Coach of the year and has been inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame. His last accomplishment was the induction into the Piedmont College Hall of Fame in 2008.\nPersonal life.\nAyers was born in Toccoa, Georgia. He was the son of Dr. and Mrs. C. L. Ayers. The nickname “Doc” came to him because his father was a medical doctor. He married Connie Terrell who graduated from Shorter College. They had three children together; Bucky, Bunny, and Buzzy.\nHe died in December 2020 at the age of 98."

        "text": "Australia submitted an unsuccessful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. On 2 December 2010 FIFA announced that the event would be held in Qatar. Australia also lodged a bid for the 2018 World Cup, but withdrew the bid on 10 June 2010. The 2018 and 2022 World Cups were the 21st and 22nd editions of the FIFA World Cup. The bidding procedure to host both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. The bid was presented by Frank Lowy, Ben Buckley, Quentin Bryce and Elle Macpherson.\nSchedule.\nAfter decades of hypothesising Australia's credentials to host the FIFA World Cup, the Howard Government welcomed tentative investigations into the viability of hosting the tournament as early as 2002. Football Australia, known at the time as Soccer Australia, targeted bidding for the 2014 edition of the tournament. After realising that Brazil were overwhelmingly likely to receive the hosting rights - which they did in 2007 - Football Federation Australia focused on a formal bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, announcing their intention to do so in November 2007. After FIFA in December 2008 announced they would be accepting bids for both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia registered their intention to bid with FIFA for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in February 2009.\nThe bid was officially launched on 14 June 2009 at Parliament House in Canberra.\nPotential venues.\nSubmitted bid venues.\nThe following are the 12 venues that were submitted to FIFA on 14 May 2010 as part of the FFA's bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup:\nRejected bid venues.\nThe following is a list of stadiums that were considered at one time as part of the FFA's bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, but did not make the final cut:\nGround sharing issues.\nOf the Australian stadiums that meet FIFA's seating criteria, none are primary association football venues. They are predominantly cricket, Australian rules football and rugby league playing venues. At the proposed time of the World Cup during the northern hemisphere summer, these facilities are normally in regular season use by Australian rules football and the rugby codes. Former England international, Peter Withe, now living in Australia, observed that \"... there are some great stadiums in Australia but a lot of them are Aussie rules arenas. These are not great for the round ball.\"\nThe need for all World Cup stadia to be used only for World Cup games prior to and during the World Cup caused controversy with the Australian Football League, and National Rugby League, who claim that loss of access to almost all their major venues for eight weeks would severely disrupt their seasons and even impact the viability of their clubs. The AFL advised it would not give up Docklands Stadium in Melbourne, and the management of Docklands Stadium (which includes the AFL as part owners of the venue) ruled out use of the stadium for the bid. The use of these shared venues remains the only option for the bid, with the Australian authorities unwilling to invest massive amounts of money in new association football-only stadia. The development of Kardinia Park (Skilled Stadium) in Geelong has been proposed to replace the loss of Docklands Stadium in the FFA bid, following the World Cup the stadium would be reconfigured to a larger oval for AFL use. Compensation claims for the disrupted seasons of the local codes may run into several hundred million dollars. The AFL and NRL and possibly also the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) will lobby for equity from government.\nThe AFL, NRL and FFA announced it had signed a Memorandum of Understanding on 9 May 2010, guaranteeing the AFL and NRL seasons will continue, should the bid be successful, and compensation for the other football codes may be awarded as a result of any disruptions caused by hosting the World Cup.\nThe seasons for Australia's football codes are as follows:\nCost concerns and benefits.\nSeveral stories in the Australian media question the restrictions and privileges that FIFA will demand of host cities at taxpayer expense, in addition to the need to build and improve so many stadia or whether \"mega-events\" like the World Cup are cost-effective. The FFA has argued that these costs are overstated.\nA report conducted by McKinsey consultants on behalf of FIFA, rated an Australian World Cup to be the worst in term of revenue. The United States were rated at 100%, Japan 73%, South Korea 71%, Qatar 70%, and Australia on 68%.\nA study by global research firm IBISWorld claimed that the 2022 World Cup would be worth $35.5 billion to the Australian economy – four times the amount generated by the 2000 Sydney Olympics.\nGovernment support.\nAustralia's bid has received government support from an early stage, with former Prime Minister John Howard announcing federal and state/territory government support before FFA announced their intention to bid.\nBid Chairman Frank Lowy AC announced at the bid launch that he has the personal commitment of the then-Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who announced the Federal Government's support for the bid in February 2008. In December 2008, Federal minister for sport Kate Ellis announced that the federal government would give Football Federation Australia $45.6 million to fund its World Cup bid preparation. Leader of the Opposition Malcolm Turnbull affirmed the support of the Opposition on 11 December 2008 and again at the formal launch of the bid in June 2009.\nRudd met with Sepp Blatter to discuss the Federal Government's support of the bid in Zurich in July 2009.\nOn 23 December 2009, with concerns over costs and effects of the bid upon other sporting codes, the Federal Government established a task force to take over much of the communication lacking by the bid in Australia. The taskforce will negotiate with governments regarding responsibility for stadium improvements, new facilities and financial guarantees. It will also organise and clarify ground-sharing arrangements with other sports and possible compensation for loss of venues.\nBid website.\nAustralia's bid website was launched 14 June 2009 and contained bid information as well as being a social media platform where users could share content and connect with each other.\nAt the launch, FFA chairman Frank Lowy AC said the people of Australia were its \"secret weapon\" to snaring the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup and encouraged the public to join the Association football-themed social networking web site. The public campaign was the first bid for a major event driven almost entirely by social media. Actress Nicole Kidman, actor Hugh Jackman, model Elle Macpherson and sports stars Ian Thorpe (swimming), Liz Ellis (netball), Mark Webber (Formula One) and Steve Waugh (cricket) joined to help promote the bid."

        "text": "Test cricket is the oldest form of cricket played at international level. A Test match takes place over a period of five days, and is played by teams representing Full Member nations of the International Cricket Council (ICC). Sri Lanka obtained Full Member status of the ICC in 1981, becoming the eighth nation eligible to play Test cricket. The Sri Lanka national cricket team played their first Test match on 17 February 1982, against England, and recorded their first victory on 6 September 1985, in a match against India. Since then, they have played nearly 300 matches, against every other Test-playing nation. Sri Lanka holds the world record for the highest team score, which was established against India in 1997. The highest partnership in Test cricket was also established by two Sri Lankan batsmen; Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara. Sri Lankan players also hold the highest partnership scores for the second and third wickets.\nTop order batsman and former captain Kumar Sangakkara holds several Sri Lankan batting records as he has scored the most runs for Sri Lanka in Test cricket. He is also the record holder for the highest number of centuries as well as the highest number of half-centuries. The 374 made by Mahela Jayawardene against South Africa in 2006 is the highest individual score by a Sri Lankan cricketer, surpassing the previous best of 340 by Sanath Jayasuriya, which was established in 1997. It is also the fourth-highest individual score in Test cricket. Jayawardene, Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara [319] are the only Sri Lankan players who have scored triple centuries.\nMuttiah Muralitharan, who was hailed by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2002 as the \"best bowler ever\" in Test cricket, dominates the bowling records for Sri Lanka. He is the world record holder for the highest number of wickets, the most five wickets per innings, as well as the most ten wickets per match. Muralitharan also holds the records for the best bowling average, best figures in an innings, best figures in a match, and best figures in a series. He missed an opportunity to capture all ten wickets in an innings in 2002 against Zimbabwe, when Chaminda Vaas took the last wicket after Muralitharan had taken the previous nine.\nThe Sri Lankan team won an ODI series against Australia in Australia in 2010. However, they are yet to register a Test match win and an ODI series win against India in India, as of 2017.\nSri Lanka holds a unique record of having the most Test wickets by both a right arm and left arm bowler:: Muralitharan with 800 wickets and Rangana Herath with 433 wickets.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties and the partnership records. Tied records for fifth place are also included. Explanations of the general symbols and cricketing terms used in the list are given below. Specific details are provided in each category where appropriate. All records include matches played for Sri Lanka only, and are correct .\nTeam records.\nResult records.\nA Test match is won when one side has scored more runs than the total runs scored by the opposing side during their two innings. If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If one side scores more runs in a single innings than the total runs scored by the other side in both their innings, it is known as a win by innings and runs. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nIndividual records.\nBatting records.\nMost career runs.\nKumar Sangakkara is the fifth-highest scoring batsman in Test cricket.\nHighest career average.\nIn cricket, batting average is the mean number of runs scored per innings. It is calculated by dividing total runs scored (including innings where he remained not out) by the number of times the batsman has been dismissed.\nHighest batting strike rate.\nMost ducks in career.\n\"Duck\" refers to a batsman dismissed without scoring.\nBowling records.\nMost wickets in a career.\nMuralitharan, who is the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket, has taken 5 wickets for the ICC World XI team during a match in 2005, which are not included in this list. Muralitharan and Shane Warne—who ranks second with 708 wickets—are the only bowlers who have captured more than 700 Test wickets.\nBest figures in an innings.\nMuttiah Muralitharan's 9 wickets for 51 runs against Zimbabwe is Test cricket's fifth-best bowling figures in a single innings. Also Rangana Herath's 9 wickets for 127 runs against Pakistan is the Best bowling figures by a left hand bowler in Test cricket history.\nBest figures in a match.\nThe Sri Lankan record of 16 wickets for 220 runs set by Muttiah Muralitharan against England is the fifth-best figures by a bowler in a single Test match.\nBest career average.\nBowling average is the measurement of mean runs conceded per wicket. In calculating this the total number of runs conceded by the bowler is divided by the number of wickets captured.\nBest career economy rate.\nA bowler's economy rate is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of overs they have bowled.\nBest career strike rate.\nA bowler's strike rate is the total number of balls they have bowled divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nMost five-wicket hauls in an innings.\nTaking five or more wickets in a single innings (called a five-wicket haul, fifer or five-for) is considered a notable achievement for a bowler. Muralitharan is well ahead of other bowlers by number of five-wicket hauls in Tests with 67 to his name; Australian cricketer Shane Warne ranks in second place with only 37, 30 below Murali. Which shows the class of Murali in bowling compared to Warne.\nMost ten-wickets in a match.\nMuralitharan has taken ten or more wickets in a match on more occasions than any other bowler in Test cricket. He has performed this feat 22 times, more than double the number of the bowler ranking second—Shane Warne, who has achieved this on 10 occasions.\nHat-trick.\nIn cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nWicket-keeping records.\nA wicketkeeper can assist in the dismissal of a batsman by taking a catch or stumping. A catch taken by the wicketkeeper means the batsman will be ruled out caught, although it may be referred to as \"caught behind\". A stumping occurs when the wicketkeeper catches a ball delivered by the bowler (provided it is a legal delivery) and putting down the batsman's wicket while he is out of his ground.\nFielding records.\nMost catches in a career.\nA \"catch\" occurs when a ball hit by the batsman in the air is held by a fielder within the field of play, before it hits the ground. In such a case, the batsman is ruled out caught.\nAll-round Records.\n1000 runs and 100 wickets.\nA total of 71 players have achieved the double of 1000 runs and 100 wickets in their Test career.\nPartnership records.\nHighest wicket partnerships.\nSri Lanka holds the highest partnerships in Test cricket for any wicket and, with the records for the second, and third wickets.\nHighest partnerships.\nThe world record partnership between Jayawardene and Sangakkara for 624 runs, and the partnership between Jayasuriya and Mahanama for 576 runs (which was the previous world record, and is now the second-highest partnership in Tests) are the only Test partnerships to surpass 500 runs."

The conditions contributed to a nail biting finale. Leeds had taken an 11-7 lead with a minute to go, but Wakefield scored a try next to the posts from the kick-off.

While his team achieved success, the tour was a tragedy for Gasnier. He broke his leg during the first test at Headingley that saw him sit out the remainder of the English leg. He returned to the field in France but in a minor game against Les Espoirs in Avignon, he suffered a further break. This would ultimately cause him to announce his retirement from playing at the age of just 28. He later told in an interview that he never regretted his decision to retire, explaining that he had been playing rugby league virtually non-stop including juniors, junior representative games, the Sydney premiership, interstate games and international tours since the early 1950s, and felt it was about time that he started devoting more time to his family."

        "text": "Trump International Golf Links &amp; Hotel Ireland, formerly Doonbeg Golf Club, is a traditional links-type course situated to the north of Doonbeg in County Clare, Ireland. Designed by Greg Norman and opened in 2002, the geography was hardly changed as the course was fitted into the area provided. The complex hosts a 5-star hotel, spa, cottages and reception rooms.\nHistory.\nClare footballer David Tubridy spent time at Doonbeg Golf Club when he was a boy (caddying for such visitors as Hugh Grant and Gary Player). When Tubridy became top scorer in National Football League history against Cork in May 2021, his total score in the competition after this game (22–412, i.e. 478 points) causing him to overtake Mickey Kearins, the then Trump-owned establishment celebrated by giving him lifetime membership of its golf club.\nIn February 2014, the lodge and golf club was bought by American businessman Donald Trump for an estimated €15M. The Lodge at Doonbeg consists of 218 hotel suites, a spa and several restaurants managed by the Trump Hotel Collection. Then Irish Minister for Finance, Michael Noonan, was criticised for participating in a red-carpet welcoming party for Donald Trump when the latter visited Ireland after completing the purchase.\nIn 2016 as a US presidential candidate, Trump claimed at a campaign rally that he bought it during an economic downturn in Ireland, that it was a good investment, but that he didn't care about it anymore and described his investment as 'small potatoes'.\nPermits for construction.\nThe business applied for permits to construct a sea wall to protect the property, citing \"global warming and its effects\", although Trump himself denies the existence of global warming. The plan attracted strong opposition from environmentalists due to concerns that it would adversely affect the Special Area of Conservation status of the site, and was withdrawn in December 2016. In December 2017, permission was granted by Clare County Council for two smaller barriers, however this permission was rescinded in early 2020, following an appeal to \"An Bord Pleanála\".\n, a decision on permission for \"53 short term let cottages, ballroom and leisure building\" was pending subject to a request for \"further information\" by Clare County Council.\nManagement.\nOn assuming the office of United States president in January 2017, Trump (along with his daughter Ivanka) resigned as director of the golf complex; his sons Eric and Donald Jr. remained. For 2019, the company had reported a pre-tax loss of 1.37 million euros. In November 2021, the resort reported revenue of 3.8 million euros in 2020 and an operating loss of almost 2 million euros ($2.3 million), a pre-tax loss of 3.59 million euros. Its workforce was reduced from 230 to 112, and the company received 459,000 euros in government grants for COVID relief."

        "text": "Basketball in Greece erupted with the win of the Greece men's national basketball team at the 1987 EuroBasket in Athens, which caused a general basketball euphoria in the country. Since then, the Greece men's national teams have achieved consistent international success, leading Greece to join Russia, Serbia, Croatia, Italy, Spain, France, and Lithuania in the circle of European basketball powers. In addition to the Greece national team's triumph in 1987, they won the gold medal at the 2005 EuroBasket, silver medals at the 1989 EuroBasket, and the 2006 FIBA World Cup, and the bronze medal at the 2009 EuroBasket.\nAt the professional club level, the Greece men's basketball clubs have, in European-wide Cup competitions, organized under both FIBA and EuroLeague Basketball, won 18 European championships, 9 of which have been won in the 1st-tier level EuroLeague competition, as well as three world club championships at the FIBA Club World Cup, bringing the total amount of international titles won by Greek men's clubs to 21. At the women's professional club level, Athinaikos won the title of the 2nd-tier EuroCup, in 2010.\nHistory.\nThe early years of the sport in Greece.\nThe sport of basketball has a long history in the country of Greece, having first come to the country in the year 1910. The first official championship of the Greek League, then called the Panhellenic Championship, was contested as regional champions playing against each other to decide a winner, starting with the 1927–28 season.\nThe great Greek athlete, Faidon Matthaiou, is considered to be the patriarch of the sport in the country. He was the country's first great player in the sport. He led Greece's senior national team to the bronze medal at the 1949 EuroBasket, in the first tournament it competed in, right after the national team had been formed. Matthaiou would go on to become one of the best players in Europe in the 1950s.\nThe 1950s.\nThe first great club team in the history of Greek basketball was the Greek League club Panellinios. Panellinios featured 5 great players, known as the \"Golden Five\" (\"Chrysi Pentada\"), or \"The Fabulous Five\": Themis Cholevas (PG), Dinos Papadimas (SG), Mimis Stefanidis (SF), Panos Manias (PF), and Aristeidis Roubanis (C). The Golden Five, and its head coach, Nikos Nisiotis, was considered to be one of the best teams in Europe at the time in the 1950s, as it won the invitational European club tournament 2 out of 3 years, and made the final in the other year. The invitational European club tournament was the forerunner tournament of the EuroLeague.\nDuring that era, Panellinios took part in the biggest international club tournaments in Europe, the predecessors of the EuroLeague that were then held instead of the EuroLeague tournament. The club advanced to the final of the 1954 San Remo Tournament, which they lost 81–74 to the Italian League club Borletti Milano. Panellinios then won the 1955 Brussels Tournament, by defeating the Yugoslav League club Crvena zvezda in the final, by a score of 91–67. Panellinios also won the 1956 San Remo Tournament, by defeating the Italian League club Minganti Bologna, by a score of 67–37.\nNisiotis is credited by most as being mainly responsible for the development of the sport in Greece in the 1930s and 1940s. Panellinios also featured the great scorer Antonis Christeas.\nThe Spanoudakis brothers, Ioannis and Alekos, who were players of Olympiacos, were among the first early important pioneers of the modern style sport in the country. Boston Celtics players Bob Cousy, and the Greek American player Lou Tsioropoulos, came to Greece in the 1950s, and gave teaching clinics on what the Celtics were doing, and how they were playing the game at the time. The Spanoudakis brothers learned directly from them, and were among the first players in Greece to incorporate much of the American style of basketball, and to begin playing a brand of basketball in Greece that incorporated many of the moves and plays that they had been shown by the Celtics players.\nThe 1960s.\nIn the 1963–64 season, the top men's basketball Greek League formed into a national league system for the first time. Up until that point, the Greek men's national basketball championship had been contested by teams locally at the regional level, with the champions of each regional level then playing against each other. With the start of the 1963–64 season, a true nationwide league system, called the Alpha National Category, was formed for the first time\nThe next great club team in men's Greek basketball was AEK, which became the first Greek team to win a European trophy in any sport. AEK was led by great players such as: Georgios Amerikanos, Georgios Trontzos, who was the second 7 footer to play for Gonzaga University, Christos Zoupas, and Antonis Christeas, who had also been a part of the great Greek Panellinios teams of the 1950s.\nAEK made it to the 1966 Final Four of the FIBA European Champions Cup of the 1965–66 season, which was the first time that the EuroLeague ever used a final four system, thus becoming the first Greek team to ever play in a final four in the EuroLeague. AEK also won the championship of the European-wide 2nd-tier level Cup Winners' Cup of the 1967–68 season, which was the first European trophy won by any Greek sports team. In the final game against Slavia VŠ Praha, which took place in Pangrati, Athens, at Panathenaic Stadium, the attendance was 80,000 people seated in the stadium, and 40,000 people standing, with an additional 3,000 police officers to keep order.\nAEK won 5 Greek League championships in the decade of the 1960s, in a sequence of 4 in a row and 5 out of 6 (1963, 1964, 1965, 1966, 1968), surrounded by an earlier Greek League championship in 1958, and another later one in 1970. Making it a total of 7 Greek League championships won in 11 seasons for the club in that era.\nThe next great individual Greek player was Georgios Kolokithas, who was considered to be one of the greatest scorers in European basketball in his time in the 1960s. He was the Greek League Top Scorer 3 times, in the years 1964, 1966, and 1967. He was also the EuroBasket Top Scorer twice, in the years 1967 and 1969. He was named to the FIBA European Selection in 1970. After the great career that he had, Kolokithas was named one of FIBA's 50 Greatest Players in 1991.\nThe Greek Women's League began with the 1967–68 season.\nThe 1970s.\nThe decade of the 1970s was dominated at the men's top club level by Panathinaikos, as they won the Greek Basket League championship in 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 1977. In total, the club won 6 Greek League championships during the 1970s. During this era, the club featured famous Greek players such as: Georgios Kolokithas, Apostolos Kontos, Dimitris Kokolakis, Memos Ioannou, and Takis Koroneos.\nOlympiacos also won 2 Greek League championships during the 1970s, winning the title in both 1976 and 1978. The club featured famous Greek players like Steve Giatzoglou and Georgios Kastrinakis, as well as players like Georgios Barlas, Paul Melini, and Pavlos Diakoulas. In 1976, the first official men's Greek Cup tournament was held. Olympiacos dominated the Greek Cup in its early years, as they won the first 3 editions of the tournament (1976, 1977, and 1978). Previously, two Attica State Cup tournaments had been held in the years 1967 and 1971, with AEK winning both of those tournaments.\nAris finished the decade by winning its first Greek League championship since 1930, in 1979. Aris was led by the great scorer of the time, Charis Papageorgiou. The great Greek scorer Vassilis Goumas, had the best years of his career in the '70s.\nThe 1980s.\n\"The Emperor\" dynasty of Aris.\nThe decade of the 1980s began with another run of dominance by Panathinaikos in men's club basketball. They won the first 3 championships of the decade (1980, 1981, and 1982). In 1983, Aris won the Greek League championship, being led by its legendary scorer Nikos Galis. Panathinaikos won the championship again in 1984, beginning the decade by winning 4 of the first 5 Greek League championships.\nPanathionaikos' great team to begin the decade of the 1980s, featured players like: Apostolos Kontos, Dimitris Kokolakis, Takis Koroneos,\nDavid Stergakos, Memos Ioannou, and Liveris Andritsos. After that, the legendary Aris Greek League dynasty of the 1980s, which was called, \"The Emperor\" rose.\nAris won the Greek League championship in every remaining year of the decade, and also won the first two championships of the 1990s (1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, and 1991). Aris also dominated the Greek Cup in the last half of the decade, as they won it in 1987, 1988, and 1989, and added two of the first three cups of the 1990s as well (1990, 1992). Aris also had good success on the European-wide level in this era, as they made it to the top-tier level EuroLeague Final Four in 3 straight years, 1988 EuroLeague Final Four, 1989 EuroLeague Final Four, and 1990 EuroLeague Final Four.\nDuring these years, Aris was coached by Giannis Ioannidis, and was led by the legendary Greek players Nikos Galis and Panagiotis Giannakis. During the club's dynasty, it also featured players like: Lefteris Subotić, Nikos Filippou, Vangelis Vourtzoumis, Vassilis Lipiridis, Georgios Doxakis, Manthos Katsoulis, and Michalis Romanidis. At one point during Aris' Greek League dynasty, the club was so dominant, that it won 80 consecutive games in the top-tier level Greek League, from 1985 to 1989.\nThe rise of the Greece men's national team.\nThe Greece men's national basketball team qualified for the 1986 FIBA World Cup, and finished the tournament in 10th place. The top 10 world finish in 1986, was a prelude to the long success that was to come for the Greece men's national team. The next year, Greece hosted the 1987 EuroBasket, and the Greece national team won the tournament's gold medal. During the tournament, they had wins over the legendary 1980s European national teams of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Greek basketball player Nikos Galis was named the tournament's MVP.\nGreece then won the silver medal at the next EuroBasket tournament, 1989 EuroBasket. Over the two EuroBasket tournaments of 1987 and 1989, Greece had a total of four wins against the Soviet Union (twice) and Yugoslavia (twice). This established Greece's senior men's national team, as one of the top 4 best national teams in the world at the time, along with the USA, Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. During this era, Greece's senior national team was led by great players like Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Panagiotis Fasoulas, and Fanis Christodoulou.\nThe 1990s.\nThe rise of the Greek League to the top of Europe.\nIn Greek men's club basketball, the 1990s started off with the ending of the great Aris dynasty of the 1980s. At the tail end of its dynasty, Aris won the Greek League championship in 1990 and 1991, the Greek Cup title in 1992, and the European-wide 2nd-tier level FIBA Saporta Cup, in 1993. They also won the European-wide 3rd-tier level FIBA Korać Cup in 1997, and the Greek Cup in 1998.

After 45 cups, Panathinaikos has won the most Greek Cups with 19. From 1995 to 2004, the tournament was held in a Final Four style tournament. It is organized by the Hellenic Basketball Federation (E.O.K.).\nIn the women's competition, the cup tournament was first held in the year 1996.\nSuccesses of the pro club teams.\nGreek men's professional basketball teams have a total of 28 appearances in the finals of European cup competitions, of which they have won a total of 17 trophies. One of the greatest achievements of Greek basketball are the victories of Panathinaikos (1996, 2000, 2002, 2007, 2009, 2011) and Olympiacos (1997, 2012, 2013) in the Finals of the 1st-tier level men's EuroLeague competition. Panathinaikos also won the international worldwide club title, the FIBA Club World Cup competition, in the year 1996. Olympiacos also won the same title in 2013. AEK Athens also won that title in 2019.\nInternational titles won – men's club teams.\nPanathinaikos\nOlympiacos\nAEK\nAris\nPAOK\nMaroussi\nInternational titles won – women's club teams.\nAthinaikos\nInternational successes of the Greece national basketball teams.\nSince winning the Greece men's basketball 1987 EuroBasket, the record of Greece national basketball shows numerous successes. The men's national youth teams especially have recorded successes in international competitions.\nSuccesses of the men's national team.\nSince the Greece men's national basketball team won its first FIBA EuroBasket gold medal in 1987, it has been a regular competitor at the EuroBasket, FIBA World Cup, and the Summer Olympics. The men's national team from 1987 included legendary players such as: Nikos Galis, Panagiotis Giannakis, Panagiotis Fasoulas, and Fanis Christodoulou. Panagiotis Giannakis also later became the senior team's head coach, and he led the Greeks to win the European Championship (EuroBasket) again, in the year 2005, at Belgrade. Giannakis became the first person ever to have succeeded in winning the FIBA European Championship (EuroBasket), both as a player and as a head coach. After the Greece national football team had earlier in 2004, won the European Championship in football, it gave Greece the rare distinction of being the European champion in the two most important team ball sports at the same time. At the 2006 FIBA World Cup held in Japan, Greece reached the final, and won the silver medal. They accomplished this after becoming the only team at the tournament to beat Team USA, whom they defeated in the semifinals, by a score of 101–95.\nGreece's senior men's team then won the bronze medal at the 2009 EuroBasket.\nMedals.\nSenior national teams.\nThe Greece men's national basketball team took part in its first FIBA European Championship (EuroBasket) at the 1949 EuroBasket, where they won the bronze medal. Greece's first big success as a nation in basketball was when their senior men's national team won the gold medal at the 1987 EuroBasket, which led to a breakthrough for the sport of basketball in the country. In the 1987 EuroBasket tournament's final, which was played in Piraeus, at Peace and Friendship Stadium (SEF), Greece defeated the heavily favored Soviet national basketball team (which included star player Šarūnas Marčiulionis) in overtime, by a score of 103 to 101.\nThe MVP of that EuroBasket was Nikos Galis, who to this day, still remains one of the biggest sports icons in Greece. In the subsequent EuroBasket tournament in 1989, Greece again reached the final, where they lost to the Yugoslavia national team, which led by its star player, Dražen Petrović, went undefeated during the tournament. By taking the silver medal at the 1989 EuroBasket, Greece cemented its position among Europe's leading basketball nations.\nGreece also won the gold medal at the 2005 EuroBasket, which was held in Serbia, after defeating Dirk Nowitzki-led Germany, in the finals, by a score of 78 to 62.\nGreece's senior men's national basketball team took part in the World Cup for the first time at the 1986 tournament, where they finished in tenth place. Greece made it to the semifinals of both the 1994 FIBA World Cup and the 1998 FIBA World Cup, which Greece also hosted. At the 2006 FIBA World Cup, which was held in Japan, Greece won the silver medal, after defeating the heavily favored USA, by a score of 101 to 95 in the semifinals. Greece also took the bronze medal at the 2009 EuroBasket.\nJunior national teams.\nThe Greek Under-19 national team won the gold medal at the 1995 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. As the tournament's host nation, the Greece's Under-19 national team won the gold medal, by defeating the Australian Under-19 national team, by a score of 91–73 in the final. The Greek gold medal-winning under-19 team of 1995 included such players as: Michalis Kakiouzis, Nikos Chatzis, Georgios Kalaitzis, Dimitris Papanikolaou, Georgios Karagkoutis, Vassilis Soulis, Dimitris Despos, and Efthimis Rentzias, who was voted the MVP of the tournament.\nMediterranean Games.\nGreece has often taken part in the Mediterranean Games. The greatest success of the men's national team at the Mediterranean Games is the gold medal, which they won in 1979. Furthermore, Greece has won four silver medals at the tournament, in the years 1991, 2001, 2005, and 2009. In addition to that, they have also won three bronze medals at the tournament, in the years 1955, 1971, and 1987.\nThe Greek women's national team won the bronze medal at the competition in 1991.\nArenas.\nThe first professional basketball indoor arena in the country was opened in 1959, in Athens. Located at the Leoforos Alexandras Stadium, the Pavlos and Thanasis Giannakopoulos Indoor Hall holds 1,500 spectators, and is still home to the ladies' basketball department of Panathinaikos. Because of its confined environment, the sports hall was named The Tomb of The Indian, after the Fritz Lang feature film \"The Indian Tomb\". In the subsequent years, a number of other arenas have arisen in Greece, located mainly in Athens and Thessaloniki. In 1966, in Thessaloniki, the Alexandreio Melathron was opened. This 5,138-seat arena (can hold up to 7,000 with temporary seating) was for decades home to both of the two arch-rivals Aris and PAOK.\nThe Peace and Friendship Stadium (SEF), originally a 17,000 capacity (later reduced to 12,000) multi-purpose hall, opened in Piraeus, Athens in 1985. The arena was for the next ten years, the biggest indoor sports hall in Greece, and it hosted events such as the 1987 EuroBasket, the 1994 World Volleyball Championship, the 1995 European Volleyball Championship, the 1998 FIBA World Cup, and the 1999 Olympic Weightlifting World Championship. SEF is the home of the Olympiacos men's basketball club.\nPeristeri's home arena, the 4,000 capacity Peristeri Indoor Hall, opened up in 1989. By the early 1990s, the sport of basketball had become well established in Greece, and the Greek Basket League had become the strongest professional national domestic league in Europe, as well as the richest. A rising number of television viewers in Greece were watching the league, there was a high level of Greek media interest in the sport, and the application of the country to host major sports events had left many of the nation's existing gyms too old and too small for the times. So, in Athens, the Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall was opened in 1995. It holds 19,250 spectators (21,098 standing room capacity), and it is still one of the two biggest indoor sports halls in Europe, where regular basketball games are held. The Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall has hosted the 1995 FIBA Under-19 World Cup, the 1995 EuroBasket, the 1998 FIBA World Cup, and the 2004 Summer Olympics. Currently, the men's club Panathinaikos plays its home games in the Olympic Hall. the men's sections of AEK Athens and Maroussi have also played home games there.\nAlso in 1995, the 4,200 capacity (expandable to 5,500) arena Larrisa Neapolis, and the 4,200 capacity arena Dimitris Tofalos were built. The Greek club Larissa has recently used the Larissa Neapolis Arena to host its home games, while the Greek club Promitheas Patras, has recently used the Dimitris Tofalos Arena to host its home games. In 2000, the first modern indoor sports arena in Thessaloniki was built, P.A.O.K. Sports Arena. The arena is under the possession of PAOK, and it holds 8,500 spectators. For the 2004 Summer Olympics, the Helliniko Indoor Arena was built. It holds 15,000 spectators, and has been used at various times, as the home arena of the Greek men's clubs Panionios, Panellinios, and AEK Athens.\nIn 2004, the 10,000 seat Ano Liosia Olympic Hall was completed. It currently hosts the home games of AEK Athens. Panionios' new 4,200-seat arena, the Boban Janković Indoor Hall, is scheduled to open up in 2021.\nMajor basketball events in Greece.\nGreece is the host of the Acropolis International Basketball Tournament, which takes place most years in Athens, since 1986. Specifically, these are:\nMen's competitions: \nWomen's competitions: \nNotable Greek basketball players.\nThe following is a list of some notable Greek basketball players and some of their important career accomplishments:\nLadies.\nLadies, in alphabetical order:\nNotable foreign basketball players in Greece.\nWith the financial rise of the professional men's club basketball competition, the Greek Basket League, during the 1990s, and the media interest for the league in Greece that was generated by large television viewership – there came a desire among viewers and fans to see Greek clubs bring in professional basketball players from abroad. Due to the Alpha 1 League's (its name at the time) immigration provisions, top foreign prospects chose the path of naturalization, in order to circumvent the league's rules. Among them were players from the former Yugoslavia, like Peja Stojaković and Marko Jarić, and from the ex-USSR, like Tiit Sokk. With the Bosman ruling in Europe in 1995, the Greek sports market was finally opened to foreign players, and as a result, today major players from around the world are active in the Basket League. The most notable foreign player that has played in the Greek League, is probably the American player Dominique Wilkins, who scored more than 26,000 points in the NBA, and is a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He left the Boston Celtics in 1995, and signed with Panathinaikos. Another well-known American player that moved to the Greek League, was the three-time NBA champion with the Los Angeles Lakers, Byron Scott, who later became a head coach in the NBA. A super talent who moved to Greece from the NBA was Roy Tarpley. In 1986, Tarpley was selected by the Dallas Mavericks, in the first round, with the seventh (7th) overall pick of the 1986 NBA draft. Tarpley made the NBA All-Rookie Team in his first season, and won the NBA Sixth Man of the Year Award the following year, when he averaged 13.5 points and 11.8 rebounds per game. In 1991, he was banned from the league for violating the NBA's drug-use policies, and in the 1992–93 season, he decided to come to the Greek League, first for Sato Aris, and then for Olympiacos. Some of the other prominent American players that moved to the Greek League, were Ken Barlow, Walter Berry, Rolando Blackman, P. J. Brown, Antonio Davis, Tony Delk, Eddie Johnson, Jeff Malone, Audie Norris, Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf, David Rivers, the four-time NBA champion John Salley, the two-time NBA champion Cliff Levingston, the future NBA head coach Scott Skiles, and Mitchell Wiggins.\nThree of the most significant foreign European players in the history of the Basket League, are the Serbian player Dejan Bodiroga, the Croatian player Dino Rađja, and the Lithuanian player Šarūnas Jasikevičius. All three were named among the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors in 2008, and Bodiroga and Jasikevičius were also named to the EuroLeague 2001–10 All-Decade Team. Bodiroga, a two-time FIBA World Cup champion, and a three-time EuroBasket champion, played for four years with Panathinaikos, and with them he won the EuroLeague championship twice. Despite the fact that he never played in the NBA, he was widely regarded as one of the world's best players at that time. Following a successful NBA career, Rađja moved to the Greek League, and he later became one of the few players to star for both of the arch-rivals Panathinaikos and Olympiacos. Jasikevičius, who is widely considered one of the best European players of all time, also moved from the NBA to the Greek League. Another well-known foreign European player to play in the Greek League was the Serbian player Dejan Tomašević.\nOther well-known foreign European players that have played in the Greek League include: the Serbs Boban Janković, Žarko Paspalj, Željko Rebrača, Zoran Savić, the Croats Arijan Komazec, Stojko Vranković, Zdravko Radulović, Damir Mulaomerović, and Nikola Vujčić, the Slovenes Rasho Nesterović and Jure Zdovc. As well as the Lithuanians Artūras Karnišovas, Ramūnas Šiškauskas, and Linas Kleiza. As well as the Frenchman Jim Bilba, the Ukrainian Sasha Volkov, and the Montenegrin Nikola Peković.\nThere have also been some other notable foreign players that have played in the Greek League. Some of them include players like: the Puerto Rican player José \"Piculín\" Ortiz, the Israeli Oded Kattash, the German Michael Koch, the Turkish player İbrahim Kutluay, and the Australians Andrew Gaze and Shane Heal. In recent years, key American players like Byron Dinkins, Maurice Evans, Alphonso Ford, Lawrence Funderburke, J.R. Holden, Roger Mason, Jeremiah Massey, Von Wafer, Josh Childress, and Acie Law have also played in the Greek League.\nNotable foreign basketball coaches in Greece.\nMany foreign coaches have been active in the Greek League. The most important one among them is the Serbian coach Željko Obradović, who was the head coach at Panathinaikos, from 1999 until 2012. Since starting his coaching career in 1991, Obradović has won nine EuroLeague championships, five of them with Panathinaikos, making him the most successful head coach in European men's pro club basketball history. Another foreign coach who has worked in the Greek League is Boža Maljković, who won 4 EuroLeague championships in his coaching career. In 1996, he led Panathinaikos to their first EuroLeague championship, which was also the first ever for a Greek club.\nAnother foreign head coach who worked in the Greek League was the multiple FIBA World Cup, and EuroBasket champion Duda Ivković. Ivković coached five teams in Greece (Aris, PAOK, Panionios, Olympiacos, and AEK), and he twice led Olympiacos to the EuroLeague championship. The three-time European-winning head coach (2× EuroLeague and the FIBA SuproLeague), the Israeli Pini Gershon, also coached in the Greek League. Obradović, Maljković, Ivković, and Gershon were honored in 2008, when they were named four of the 50 Greatest EuroLeague Contributors. Some other important foreign coaches that have coached in the Greek League, are the American NBA head coach Scott Skiles, the legendary Krešimir Ćosić, Vlade Đurović, \"the two Cups\" Željko Pavličević, Zvi Sherf, Dragan Šakota, Petar Skansi, Jonas Kazlauskas, Duško Ivanović, Sasha Djordjević, Xavi Pascual, Jure Zdovc, and David Blatt.\nGreek players abroad.\nHistorically, the best Greek players generally did not play abroad because of the financial strength of Basket League, enabling its clubs to keep the country's top players at home. Until the late 1990s, virtually all of the Greece emn's national basketball team members played their club basketball in Greece. This situation began to change in the early 2000s, when the top leagues in Russia and Spain experienced huge financial growth, and a few top players chose to chase the even greater financial rewards and competitive challenge of the NBA.\nThis can be illustrated by the makeup of Greece's two EuroBasket-winning teams. All 12 players on the 1987 EuroBasket roster were under contract to Greek clubs, while five members of the 2005 EuroBasket squad were playing outside Greece. More recently, this phenomenon has begun to change as many Greek clubs, most notably long-time rivals Panathinaikos and Olympiacos, have offered top-notch salaries, to once again attract Greece's top players back home. Today, relatively few Greeks play in foreign leagues, and generally, they are usually not the country's best players. The final 12-man Greek squad for the 2010 FIBA World Championship included only three players who were under contract with a club in another country. Only one of the three, Nikos Zisis, had played outside the country for more than one season, going into the 2010 World Championship (he was preparing to start his second season with Montepaschi Siena of the Italian League). At the same time, Georgios Printezis was entering his second season at Unicaja of the Spanish League, and Sofoklis Schortsanitis had just left Olympiacos for Maccabi Tel Aviv of the Israeli League.\nIn addition to the players already named above, some of the other Greek players who have played for significant periods outside the country include:\nAmong the favorite foreign leagues for Greek players are Russia's Russian Professional Championship (in its various forms over the years – Russian Superleague A, Russian PBL, and VTB United League), the Liga ACB in Spain, and the Lega Basket Serie A in Italy.\nPlayers from the Greek diaspora.\nThe Greek diaspora has produced a number of prominent players who chose to start or establish their careers in Greece.\nPerhaps the country's most celebrated player, Nikos Galis, is the son of Greek emigrants. He was born and raised in New Jersey. More recently, Pat and Nick Calathes, born and raised in Florida, who are descended from their Greek grandfather, chose to start their professional careers in Greece. The older Pat began his career at Maroussi, went from there to Kolossos Rodou, and then joined Panathinaikos, where Nick had played since beginning his professional career. Both remained at PAO through the 2011–12 season, after which they left Greece to continue their careers elsewhere in Europe (Pat in Israel and Nick in Russia). Pat then played in Panathinaikos again, while Nick has also returned to Panathianikos, after a two-year stint in the NBA. Michael Bramos is another American born player from the Greek diaspora, that chose to begin his pro career in Greece with Peristeri.\nLazaros Papadopoulos and Jake Tsakalidis were born to diaspora Greeks in the former Soviet Union, in modern-day Russia and Georgia respectively, but moved to Greece with their families at young ages, and they were developed in Greece. Both began their professional careers in Greece, but had extensive tenures outside the country, before eventually returning. Papadopoulos established himself as a star with Panathinaikos, but spent many of his best years in Russia, Spain, and Italy, while Tsakilidis spent seven years in the NBA, after starting with AEK. Sergei Bazarevich, was also born and raised in the Soviet Union, and also had Greek lineage. He played in both Greece and the NBA.\nFormer Greek NBA player, Kosta Koufos, is also from the Greek diaspora, but he has never played with a Greek pro club. Like Galis, he is the son of Greek emigrants, and was born and raised in the U.S. (in his case, Ohio), but he went directly from Ohio State University, to the NBA, without a stopover in Greece. However, Koufos chose to represent the Greece men's national basketball team internationally, as did the Calathes brothers and Bramos. Recently, the Greek diaspora produced players like: Tyler Dorsey, Naz Mitrou-Long, and Zach Auguste, whom have chosen to represent Greece internationally.\nGreek NBA players.\nThe first Greek-born basketball player that made the leap to the NBA was Antonis Fotsis. Fotsis was selected in the 2001 NBA draft, by the Memphis Grizzlies, and he played with them in the NBA for one season. After one season in the NBA, Fotsis returned to Greece, reportedly due to homesickness. Efthimios Rentzias and Andreas Glyniadakis also played in the NBA for one season, before returning to play in Europe.\nVassilis Spanoulis, who was regarded to be the top Greek basketball talent, and the main Greek-born NBA prospect, moved to the NBA in 2006, to play with the Houston Rockets, but he returned to Greece after a disappointing season, both for himself and the Rockets. This was mainly due both to some personal disagreements that he had with then Rockets head coach Jeff Van Gundy, and because of personal family problems.\nGiannis Antetokounmpo is a Greek professional basketball player of Nigerian descent, who currently plays for the Milwaukee Bucks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). His nickname is \"The Greek Freak\". His older brother, Thanasis, has also played in the NBA games with the New York Knicks and the Bucks. Another one of the Antetokounmpo brothers, Kostas, has also played in the NBA.\nJake Tsakalidis, who was born in Georgia, and raised and developed basketball-wise in Greece, played in the NBA from 2000 to 2007, after beginning his career in Greece. Sergei Bazarevich, born and raised in the Soviet Union, and of Greek descent. Some other NBA players with Greek citizenship include: Peja Stojaković, Rasho Nesterović, Marko Jarić, and Dragan Tarlać, whom all moved to Greece at a young age, the Greek-American players Kurt Rambis, Kosta Koufos, Nick Calathes, and Tyler Dorsey, as well as the Greek-Canadian player Naz Mitrou-Long. The Lebanese-born Rony Seikaly, who played in the NBA from 1988 to 1999, and also played with the senior men's USA national team, was also raised and developed basketball-wise in Greece.\nThe Greek players Kostas Papanikolaou and Georgios Papagiannis, have also played in the NBA.\nGreek WNBA players.\nAnastasia Kostaki and Evanthia Maltsi are female Greek professional basketball players that have played in the WNBA.\nPlayers with the most men's Greek League championships won.\nThis is a list of the basketball players that have won the most championships over the years in the men's 1st-tier level Greek League.\nBasketball in the Greek media.\nOn a daily basis, 16 newspapers in the country of Greece publish what is happening in the sport of basketball. Although the media's main focus is always on the men's professional club Greek League, they will also report on the lower level divisions, like the men's A2 League, as well as the NBA, and the other major European national domestic leagues, like the Spanish ACB League and big international club competitions like the EuroLeague.\nGreek television has the ability to broadcast all of the men's Greek League games. The men's professional club Greek League has the TV rights to distribute itself on the Greek public broadcaster ERT, the private channel ANT1, and the pay TV station Novasport. EuroLeague games are also broadcast on Novasport, and the private channel Skai TV. Live broadcasts of the Greek League men's national championship, and European-wide professional club games are also offered by the country's large number of sports radio stations."

Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the 2002 tournament having been played in Japan and South Korea.

        "text": "The knockout phase of the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League began on 16 February and concluded on 22 May 2010 with the final won by Internazionale against Bayern Munich 2–0 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid. The knockout phase involved the sixteen teams who finished in the top two in each of their groups in the group stage.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nFormat.\nEach tie in the knockout phase, apart from the final, was played over two legs, with each team playing one leg at home. The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, 30 minutes of extra time were played. If there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was settled via a penalty shoot-out.\nThe draw mechanism for each round is as follows:\nIn the final, the tie was played over just one leg at a neutral venue. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores remained tied.\nRound of 16.\nThe draw for the competition's round of 16 was held on 18 December 2009. Starting this season, the round of 16 was spread over a month, instead of two weeks. The first legs of the round of 16 were played on 16, 17, 23, and 24 February, and the second legs were played on 9, 10, 16, and 17 March 2010.\nCSKA Moscow became the first Russian team to advance to the quarter-finals under the present format (16 teams in the knockout stage).\nMatches.\n\"Barcelona won 5–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Bordeaux won 3–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Internazionale won 3–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate; Bayern Munich won on away goals.\"\n\"CSKA Moscow won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Lyon won 2–1 on aggregate.\"\n\"Arsenal won 6–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"Manchester United won 7–2 on aggregate.\"\nQuarter-finals.\nThe draw for the quarter-finals took place in Nyon, Switzerland, on 19 March 2010. There was no seeding and no country protection, meaning that it was an entirely random draw.\nThe first legs were played on 30 and 31 March 2010, and the second legs were played on 6 and 7 April 2010.\nMatches.\n\"Lyon won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\n\"4–4 on aggregate; Bayern Munich won on away goals.\"\n\"Barcelona won 6–3 on aggregate.\"\n\"Internazionale won 2–0 on aggregate.\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe draw for the semi-finals took place immediately after the draw for the quarter-finals. The first legs were played on 20 and 21 April 2010, with the second legs on 27 and 28 April 2010. There were fears that the first legs would have to be postponed due to the eruptions of the volcano at Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland. On 18 April, UEFA issued a statement that the matches would go ahead and that the teams would have to make alternate travel arrangements.\nMatches.\n\"Bayern Munich won 4–0 on aggregate.\"\n\"Internazionale won 3–2 on aggregate.\"\nFinal.\nThe 2010 UEFA Champions League Final was the fourth to be held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, Spain, after the 1957, 1969 and 1980 finals. It also was the first to be held on a Saturday."

        "text": "tRA is a baseball statistic used to measure the performance of a pitcher. Similar to FIP, tRA uses a mathematical formula to isolate the pitcher from his defense. Thus, tRA is a defense-independent pitching statistic. Unlike FIP and dERA, however, tRA takes into account batted ball type (that is, line drives, fly balls, pop ups, and ground balls) as well as strikeouts, walks, and home runs.\nTheory and method.\ntRA was developed by Graham MacAree. According to StatCorner, \"The batter may strike out looking, strike out swinging, walk, be walked intentionally or be hit by a pitch. The hitter may also hit a line drive, a ground ball, an outfield fly, a popup, a bunt or a home run. These possibilities can be regarded as being governed by the pitcher, provided that there is a large enough sample size. tRA is built around knowing how many runs and outs each of these events are worth.\"\ntRA uses play-by-play data gathered from each MLB season in order to give each possible outcome between a pitcher and a batter a linear weight. For example, in 2008, a line drive went for an out 30.5% of the time, while it had a run value of 0.384. These statistics are used to calculate expected outs (xOuts) and expected runs (xRuns). Once these values are obtained, tRA can be converted to runs per nine innings by taking (xRuns/xOuts)*27.\nLike other sabermetrics, tRA has alternate versions. tRA+ is compared to league average. For example, a tRA+ of 120 would mean that pitcher was 20% better than league average. tERA is tRA except that it is scaled to earned runs allowed instead of runs allowed."

The tourists then moved to Wales to play a team designated 'A Welsh XV' but which was in fact a full-strength Wales team. Although neither Wales nor New Zealand awarded caps for the match it was a full international in all but name and attracted a crowd of 50,000 to Cardiff Arms Park for a midweek afternoon match. The final fixture was against the Barbarians who selected the entire pack of forwards who had played in the test matches on that year's 1974 British Lions tour to South Africa. The Barbarians held the All Blacks to a 13–13 draw and prevented them from completing a clean sweep by winning all eight matches on tour.\nThis was the first time that the All Blacks had undertaken a short tour to Europe.

The club has excellent relations with all local junior clubs within the area, and is committed to the best ideals of sport and social integration for the youth of the area.\nHistory.\nBeecroft Rugby Club had its origins in the St Leo’s Old Boys RUFC, which thrived for years until the school changed focus and its player stream dried up.

The club then moved to Hills area, where the Beecroft Rugby Club was born and thrives to this day.\nIn the fifteen rugby seasons Beecroft has been in the suburban competition, the club has made fifteen grand finals in various grades. It has virtually rocketed through the various divisions of the NSW Suburban Rugby Union competition and is currently in the 1st Division of that competition. The club has also competed in the Under 85 kg competition since its inauguration in 2006. In the three years of the competition Beecroft has competed in each Grand Final, winning the State Title in 2006 and 2008.\nFrom 2006 to 2008 in particular the club had tremendous success on the playing field.

In 2007 this feat was repeated with the 1st Grade team again winning the Barraclough Cup and the 4th Grade team likewise winning the Richardson Cup.\nIn 2008, the club was promoted to 1st Division following its success in the 2nd Division competition in 2007, and had quite a successful season with the 1st Grade team reaching the Kentwell Cup grand final and the club finishing in a very creatable fourth place on the Club Championship table, a truly outstanding result for the club.\nHonours.\nClub Awards\nPremierships.\n1st Grade\n2nd Grade\n3rd Grade\n4th Grade\nUnder 85 kg"

The badge denotes a founding date of 1787, however there are records of games prior to this, one in particular between the club and Pinner in 1760.\nIt is known there was a match between Rickmansworth and Pinner in 1790 in which 7 Rickmansworth Batsmen were run out. The local Paper, the \"Watford Observer\", noted that this was due, in no small part, to 'an excess of Beef and Beer prior to the match'.\nIn the early days the club was based at the south end of Rickmansworth near where the White Bear Pub is today. In 1803, Rickmansworth hosted its only 1st class game to date. HC Woolridge's XI v WR Capel's XI. Clifford's Park, Rickmansworth. 26 August 1803. It is unclear where the Clifford's Park ground was situated in Rickmansworth. The primary player in the game was Lord Frederick Beauclerk, one of the best single-wicket cricketers of his time. His under-arm bowling was very slow, but extremely accurate - and he could get the ball to rise abruptly off a length. Beauclerk was the second president of the MCC in 1826. The Captain of one team was William Capel\nA few years later the club relocated to Rickmansworth Park, opposite the Met Station, which is now the grounds of the Royal Masonic School for Girls. In the middle of the 19th century, the club moved to its present ground at Park Road and functioned from a wooden pavilion which provided accommodation only for serving refreshments and for teams to change their attire. A score book dated 1881–1883, has been preserved, and in this score book there are details of a match with an England team. The overs were 4 ball overs at the time, and teams rarely scored more than 100 and often batted twice in a day.\nFrom this time onwards Rickmansworth were one of the top club sides in the South of England. In 1881 they played an England XI and won by 9 wickets, despite the England team containing Billy Midwinter, famous as being the only player to represent England and Australia in Test matches.\nIn 1882 Rickmansworth again hosted an All England team of professional players preparing to face the touring Australians 9 days later. Rickmansworth (fielding 18 players against the England Eleven) were defeated by 128 runs, but the England team went on to lose the most famous of matches, the original ‘Ashes’, at the Oval just over a week later. The same Ashes which are so keenly contested to this day.\nA local guide circulated in Rickmansworth about 1912 contained an article by Mr Tom Bevan, the headmaster of the Boys Elementary School from about 1890, giving details of some of his researches at Lords. In this article it is stated that the Rickmansworth Club played an England team at the Lords ground in 1807 – that is before the Battle of Waterloo.\nThe cricket ground was actually the property of Salters Brewery, which was situated on both sides of the road near where the Joan of Arc Roman Catholic School now stands. Access to the field was by a road where the Roman Catholic Church now stands and continuing on the left of the old Malt House, now known as St Augustine's Hall.\nThe old wooden pavilion, situated where the Cricket nets are now, had a small lawn in front of it, enclosed by an iron fence and only males were allowed to enter.\nAfter the Great War the cricket field was again put into condition for play to be resumed, In early 1920 Salters Brewery was taken over by one of the large Brewery firms, and the threat of the Club losing the ground it had used for such a long time was very real. It was then that Mr Francis William Reckitt, who was a grandson of the founders of the Reckitt &amp; Sons business, an artist, who had lived in the town since 1904, stepped in and bought the whole property. He then had a modern club house erected as now, a hockey field laid out on what is now the 3rd team pitches, replacing the bowling greens, and hard and grass lawn tennis courts constructed. The hard courts were where the car park is today and you can still see the brick built surrounds. Of course there were few cars in those days so no need for a car park.\nThe club now provided facilities for cricket, bowls, lawn tennis and hockey and when the club house was officially opened on 2 February 1924, it then assumed the title of the Rickmansworth Cricket and Sports Club. William Reckitt set the property and grounds in Trust providing Sport was always played on the grounds.\nA cricket team functioned throughout the Second World War of 1939-1945 and the cricket field was kept properly cut and the actual playing pitch of the hockey field was not allowed to grow wild. This was only possible because of an arrangement with the Hertfordshire County Council giving them sole use of the greater part of the club house as a children's nursery, and the financial arrangements made with the county during the war, and compensation when the war was ended enabled the club to pay its way and accumulate a small surplus.\nSince the War the club started a steady decline from being a premier County side to, by the 1970s a club in a downward spiral. By the early 1980s the club house was altered to accommodate an upstairs changing room and the downstairs kitchen and garden, which had existed for the use of the club professional from the 1930s to the 1960s, was removed. By the mid-1980s the club languished in the bottom division in Hertfordshire Cricket and the two Saturday and two Sunday teams was reduced to barely 1 team on each day. The Club considered a move to the Thames Valley League but decided to stay in the Hertfordshire set-up.\nIn the 1990s the club started to attract new players again and won the 3rd Division and 2nd Division of the Saracens Herts Cricket League in successive years. The 2nd team were promoted also in 1995 and 1998. More recently the 1st XI and 2nd XI won successive promotions in 2018 and 2019 to now represent the club in Divisions 4 and 6 of the Saracens Herts Cricket League.\nIn modern times the club is now a flourishing cornerstone of the community offering cricket for up to 5 teams playing Hertfordshire League Cricket and at least one team on Sundays. Just as importantly there is a growing Youth Cricket Section and a number of the youngsters now represent the District, Area and County in Cricket."

        "title": "1871 Scotland versus England rugby union match",
        "text": "The rugby union match played between Scotland and England on 27 March 1871 was the world's first international rugby match. It is also officially the first international football match in any football code. The match was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh in front of 4,000 spectators. Scotland won the match, scoring two tries and a goal to England's single try.\nOverview.\nThe match resulted from a challenge issued in the sporting weekly \"Bell's Weekly\" on 8 December 1870 and signed by the captains of five Scottish clubs, inviting any team \"selected from the whole of England\" to a 20-a-side game to be played under the rugby rules. The game was played at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, the home ground of Edinburgh Academicals, on 27 March 1871. The English team wore all white, with a red rose on its shirts and the Scots, brown shirts with a thistle and white cricket flannels. \nThe team representing England was captained by Frederick Stokes of Blackheath, that representing Scotland was led by Francis Moncrieff; the umpires were Hely Hutchinson Almond, headmaster of Loretto School in Scotland, and A. Ward from England.\nThe matches for this season were decided on goals scored. A goal was awarded for a successful conversion after a try, for a dropped goal or for a goal from mark. If a game was drawn, any unconverted tries were tallied to give a winner. If there was still no clear winner, the match was declared a draw.\nThe game, played over two halves, each of 50 minutes, was won by Scotland, who scored a goal with a successful conversion kick after grounding the ball over the goal line (permitting them to \"try\" to kick a goal). Both sides achieved a further \"try\" each, but failed to convert them to goals, as the kicks were unsuccessful. Angus Buchanan was the first man to score a try in international rugby.\nIn a return match at the Kennington Oval, London, in 1872, England were the winners.\nMatch summary.\nOn 28 March 1871, a report was carried on page 5 of The Glasgow Herald with the title \"FOOTBALL MATCH - England v Scotland\"\nThis great football match was played yesterday, on the Academy Cricket Ground, Edinburgh, with a result most gratifying for Scotland. The weather was fine, and there was a very large turnout of spectators. The competitors were dressed in appropriate costume, the English wearing a white jersey, ornamented by a red rose, and the Scotch brown jersey, with a thistle. Although the good wishes of the spectators went with the Scotch team, yet it was considered that their chances were poor. The difference between the two teams was very marked, the English being of a much heavier and stronger build compared to their opponents. The game commenced shortly after three o'clock, the Scotch getting the kick off, and for some time neither side had any advantage. The Scotch, however, succeeded in driving the ball close to the English goal, and, pushing splendidly forward, eventually put it into their opponents' quarters, who, however, prevented any harm accruing by smartly \"touching down\". This result warmed the Englishmen up to their work, and in spite of tremendous opposition they got near the Scotch goal, and kicked the ball past it, but it was cleverly \"touched down\" they got no advantage. This finished the first 50 minutes, and the teams changed sides.\nFor a considerable time after the change the ball was sent from side to side, and the \"backs\" got more work to do. By some lucky runs, however, the Scotch got on to the borders of the English land, and tried to force the ball past the goal. The English strenuously opposed this attempt, and for a time the struggle was terrible, ending in the Scotch \"touching down\" in their opponents' ground and becoming entitled to a \"try\". This result was received with cheers, which were more heartily renewed when Cross, to whom the \"kick off\" was entrusted, made a beautiful goal. This defeat only stirred up the English to fresh efforts, and driving the ball across the field, they managed also to secure a \"try\", but unfortunately the man who got the \"kick off\" did not allow sufficient windage, and the ball fell short. After this the Scotch became more cautious, and playing well together secured after several attempts a second \"try\", but good luck did not attend the \"kick off\" and the goal was lost. Time being then declared up the game ceased, the Scotch winning by a goal and a \"try\"."

J. Brodeur of Penn).\nThere was no 2021 award because the Ivy League canceled all winter sports for the 2020–21 season, including men's basketball, due to COVID-19 concerns."

        "text": "The PBR World Cup was a team competition developed by the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) organization in 2007 in which bull riders from the five different countries where PBR events were sanctioned competed for their share of a $100,000 prize. Each team consisted of five riders from their respective countries, each with their own team captain (who was either a current or a former rider).\nThe 25 riders competed in four rounds, two rounds each night, with all the contestants riding in each round, which meant fans could see 50 rides per night. The team captain could only select three scores for each round. Once all four rounds were complete, the team with the highest total score would be declared the winner.\nDuring the first World Cup, the contestants rode with their regular attire that they normally competed in, but starting with the following World Cup, the teams rode with uniforms that represented their respective countries. \nThe first World Cup, held in 2007, took place at the Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia.\nThe second World Cup was held in 2008 at the Manuel Bernardo Aguirre Gymnasium in Chihuahua, Chihuahua Mexico.\nThe third World Cup was held in 2009 at the Parque do Peão in Barretos, São Paulo, Brazil.\nThe fourth World Cup took place in the spring of 2010 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, United States.\nThe PBR World Cup event has since been discontinued, and a different event, the PBR Global Cup, began in 2017 and was held through 2022 before being discontinued as well."

Rowers from West Germany dominated the competition, winning five of the seven boat classes.\nBackground.\nThe Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron (FISA) decided in 1961 that, like at the Olympics, rowers from the whole world should compete for a championship title; thus far, they had only organised the European Rowing Championships, although they were open to rowers from outside of Europe. Prior to the 1974 World Rowing Championships, only men competed. Seven boat classes were part of the inaugural world championships that was held from 6 to 9 September on the Swiss Rotsee. There were 401 competitors from 24 countries (counting East and West Germany as one country) with 107 boats at the competition. Between 13 (double scull) and 17 (coxless pair) competed per boat class.\nGerman rowers.\nFISA did not recognise East Germany, hence only one German crew was permitted per event. Selection trials between East and West German crews were held on 3 September on the Rotsee, three days before the start of the championships. As was predicted by East German media outlets, West German crews would win in six of the seven categories, with 1960 Olympic single scull silver medal winner Achim Hill the only successful East German qualifier, beating Edgar Heidorn from Hanover. During the world championships, Hill did not proceed beyond the heats, though.\nMedal summary.\nMedalists at the 1962 World Rowing Championships:\nMedal table.\nThe countries that did compete but did not win medals were Denmark and the Netherlands (they had entered 7 boats each), Czechoslovakia (6 boats), Norway and Poland (5 boats each), Belgium, Japan and Sweden (4 boats each), Australia, Finland and Canada (3 boats each), Israel, Yugoslavia, and Hungary (2 boats each), and New Zealand and Portugal (1 boat each)."

        "text": "Blake Ferguson (born 20 March 1990) is a former professional rugby league footballer.\nDuring his Rugby League career he represented the Indigenous All Stars, Country NSW, and New South Wales in the State of Origin series.

He was just beaten by Jamal Idris as the rookie of the year at the 2009 Dally M Awards.\nFollowing a clause in his contract that allowed him to leave the Sharks if coach Ricky Stuart left, Ferguson also left the club at the end of 2010.\nCanberra Raiders.\nFerguson signed a 2-year deal to play with the Canberra Raiders starting from 2011. He was the Raiders top try-scorer for the season.\nFollowing his debut Origin game in 2013 Ferguson's league career took a highly publicised downward spiral following an indecent assault charge. Ferguson finished the 2013 Canberra Raiders season as the club's top try scorer.\nSydney Roosters.\nIn May 2014, Ferguson signed with the Sydney Roosters, who beat out South Sydney Rabbitohs for his services. However, due to Ferguson's guilty verdict in his 2013 indecent assault charge, the NRL in late June 2014 rejected an application for him to join the Sydney Roosters for the remainder of the 2014 NRL season, meaning he had to wait until the 2015 season to play for his new club. As part of his rehabilitation, Ferguson completed a rugby league refereeing course. He was widely seen as the man to replace Sonny Bill Williams, who departed after the 2014 season.\nFor the 2015 NRL season Ferguson's healthy form led to Wendell Sailor considering him \"the second best buy of the season\". Following the departure of Roger Tuivasa-Sheck from the Roosters, after 2015, Ferguson was anointed as the player to replace him at for the 2016 season. However, after just one game at fullback, he was moved back to the centres.\nFerguson was part of the Eastern Suburbs team that qualified for the finals in 2017. In the qualifying final, Ferguson almost cost his side the game when he chose to bat the ball back into play when it was heading to the sideline enabling Brisbane winger Corey Oates to score a try and put Brisbane in front with minutes to play. Easts went on to win the game in the dying minutes thanks to a Latrell Mitchell try. In the preliminary final against North Queensland, Ferguson scored a try off a knock on from North Queensland player Justin O'Neill to make the score 16–12 with less than 15 minutes to play in the match and with Eastern Suburbs in control. In the next play from the restart Ferguson lost the ball after being hit in a good tackle by O'Neill, who had lost the ball moments earlier. In the following play North Queensland scored courtesy of Kyle Feldt and Easts never recovered losing the match 29–16 in a huge upset.\nOn 4 July 2018, Ferguson signed a three-year contract to join Parramatta beginning in 2019. Ferguson rejected a similar offer by Newcastle and wanted a new contract with Eastern Suburbs but the club was only prepared to offer him a one-year deal.\nIn round 25 of the 2018 season, Ferguson scored his 100th try against his future club from 2019 onwards, the Parramatta Eels. His final game for the Roosters was the 2018 NRL Grand Final, in which it was revealed that he had played the second half with a broken leg.\nParramatta Eels.\nFerguson made his debut for Parramatta against Penrith in Round 1 of the 2019 season.

Ferguson scored a second half try in the defeat.\nAt the end of the 2019 regular season, Parramatta finished in 5th place on the table and qualified for the finals. In the elimination final against Brisbane, Ferguson scored a try as Parramatta won the match 58–0 at the new Western Sydney Stadium. The victory was the biggest finals win in history, eclipsing Newtown's 55–7 win over St George in 1944. The match was also Parramatta's biggest win over Brisbane and Brisbane's worst ever loss since entering the competition in 1988.\nOn 30 September, Ferguson was named at wing for the Australia PM XIII side.\nIn round 17 of the 2020 NRL season, Ferguson scored his first try of the year as Parramatta defeated the New Zealand Warriors 24–18 at the Central Coast Stadium. It was Ferguson's first try in nearly 12 months with his previous try coming against Brisbane in the 2019 elimination final.\nIn round 3 of the 2021 NRL season, he scored two tries in a 28–4 victory over Cronulla-Sutherland.\nThe following week in round 4, he scored two tries for Parramatta in a 36–22 victory over the Wests Tigers at Stadium Australia. Ferguson then experienced a mid-season form slump, which resulted in him being overlooked for selection in the NSW State of Origin side for Game One of the series, as well as being dropped from the Parramatta side for their Round 12 game against the Newcastle Knights.\nAfter spending seven weeks in the NSW Cup, Ferguson was recalled to the Parramatta side for their round 19 match against Canberra. Ferguson set up a second half try for Parramatta during the game which they lost 12–10.\nIn round 24, Ferguson scored two tries for Parramatta in a 22–10 victory over Melbourne.

Fittler had publicly stated to the media before the team selection that NSW needed to change its \"selfish culture\". Despite Ferguson's strong 2018 form, the 28-year-old's non-selection was no great shock given the players infamous afternoon at a pub with Josh Dugan five days out from the 2017 series decider.\nAfter missing out on selection for New South Wales in 2018, Ferguson was selected for Game 2 of the 2019 State of Origin series which New South Wales would go on to win 38–6 at Optus Stadium in Perth.\nFerguson was retained for Game 3 of the series which was played at ANZ Stadium in the deciding match.

        "text": "The 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup () was the seventh edition of the Women's Rugby World Cup, and the sixth held in Europe. The World Cup Final took place on 17 August.\nAll of the pool games for the World Cup took place at the Centre National du Rugby (CNR) in Marcoussis and Marcoussis Rugby Club with the French union adopting the concept of restricting the tournament to one or two locations as in the 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup in London. Marcoussis is about 20 miles south of Paris.\nThe knockout stages of the tournament also saw matches played at the CNR in Marcoussis, with the semi-finals, Bronze Final and Final taking place at Stade Jean-Bouin in the French capital – home of Stade Français.\nThe matches took place on 1, 5, 9, and 13 August with the final played on 17 August.\nThe tournament format was the same as in 2010, with 12 teams split into three pools of four. The pool allocation draw took place once all 12 teams were confirmed.\nEngland won the final 21-9 against Canada on 17 August.\nBidding process.\nOn 27 August 2009 the International Rugby Board (IRB; now known as World Rugby) announced that it was inviting bids to host the 2014 event. Unions had until 30 October 2009 to express an interest with the chosen host being announced on 12 May 2010. The announcement was an important development in the history of women's rugby as the IRB had never previously announced a competition to host a Women's World Cup with such publicity, nor so far ahead of the event. The chosen hosts for 2014 would also have had four years to prepare – twice as long as any previous host. The announcement was also significant because, for the first time, the IRB included the \"unofficial\" 1991 and 1994 World Cups in their official list of previous tournaments.\nOn 21 December 2009, the IRB announced the four nations that formally applied to host the 2014 Women's Rugby World Cup:\nHowever, after delaying the announcement until September 2010, the IRB eventually announced that, due to problems with the existing bids, they were reopening applications. On 30 June 2011, the IRB announced that the tournament would be held in France.\nQualifying.\nFrance, as the host nation, qualified automatically. The top three teams from the 2010 tournament, New Zealand, England, and Australia, also qualified automatically. Canada and the United States qualified due to there being no interest from other North or South American unions.\nMatch officials.\nIn April 2014 the IRB announced a panel of 14 match officials for the tournament, including eight referees and six assistant. New Zealand provided two of the referees in the form of Jess Beard and Nicky Inwood, while there will be one each from United States, England, South Africa, Ireland, Australia and Canada. England provided two assistant referees with the others coming from Italy, France, Scotland and Spain. Nicky Inwood, Sherry Trumbull and Clare Daniels were selected for 2010 Women's Rugby World Cup, which took place in England. Indeed, Inwood and Daniels also refereed at the 2006 edition in Canada.\nIn August 2014, it was announced that Australian referee Amy Perrett would adjudicate the final.\nPool stage.\nThe pool draw took place on 30 October 2013 at Hotel de Ville, Paris. The twelve qualified teams were organised into four bands:\nBand 1: New Zealand, England, Australia &lt;br&gt;\nBand 2: Canada, USA, France &lt;br&gt;\nBand 3: Ireland, Wales, Spain &lt;br&gt;\nBand 4: Kazakhstan, Samoa, South Africa\nEach pool was a single round-robin of six games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw and none for a defeat of more than seven points. A team scoring four or more tries in one match earned a bonus point, as did teams that lost by seven points or fewer.\nFinals.\nKnockout rankings.\nAt the completion of the pool stage, teams were ranked first according to their position within their pool and then by competition points. The top four teams progressed to the tournament semi-finals, teams ranked 5–8 progressed to the 5th to 8th play-offs, and the teams ranked 9–12 progressed to the 9th to 12th play-offs.\nTie Breakers.\nTies on competition points were broken in the following order:&lt;br&gt;\n1.

        "text": "Naked Rugby League is a black-and-white nude calendar featuring professional rugby league footballers of Australasia's National Rugby League competition.\nReleased in October 2006, the 2007-2008 14-month calendar spanning from January 2007 to February 2008 calendar was produced in the same erotic style of French rugby's annual Dieux du Stade calendars with the players being photographed nude separately in various locations, both indoors and outdoors. The photos were taken by the Australian celebrity photographer Pedro Virgil.\nThe calendar was released in general black-and-white edition and a limited edition in colour. But the calendar was not officially sanctioned by the National Rugby League. \nProceeds from its sales were donated to benefit the National Breast Cancer Foundation of Australia.\nNaked Rugby League was a follow-up to League of Their Own 2006.\nParticipants.\nThe calendar featured ten of the previous twelve \"League Of Their Own (2006)\" players Same pictures or similar photos were used for the 10 players. Only Brad Tighe and Ryan McGoldrick) from the \"League of Their Own\" were taken out to be replaced by three new players, three being Greg Bird, Brent Webb, Paul Whatuira and the fourth, an unknown unidentified mystery player who was photographed from behind.\nThe following players are featured:\nReactions.\nImmediately after publication of the calendar, the National Rugby League was quick to distance itself from the project. \"We don't have an issue with the players having got their gear off, but what we want known is the NRL is not associated with the calendar,\" NRL chief operating officer Graham Annesley told Australia's \"Sydney Confidential\". Anneseley particularly criticized Nick Youngquest of the St. George Illawarra Dragons for his photograph (the calendar's June 2007 image) saying that \"Youngquest had taken the idea 'too far'. He may not have known that he was in that, ah, position, but it's just something we feel the publishers went too far with\". About the charitable cause the calendar served, Anneseley responded: \"We have a very close association with the National Breast Cancer Foundation... but the nature of the publication is not anything that we would have approved to be associated with the NRL.\"\nA National Breast Cancer Foundation spokeswoman said the organisation was not behind the actual production of the calendar, but confirmed it would benefit from its sale.\nYoungquest responded that he knew what he was doing at the time but did it for a charitable cause with the proceeds going to breast cancer research. He commented: \"The photographer [Pedro Virgil] rang and said the best photo he had was a bit revealing and asked me if I minded. I said I didn't mind. It's all for a good cause.\" This wasn't Youngquest's first nude calendar and the player was regularly voted as top of the most attractive player polls. Youngquest continued: \"It is for breast cancer, so if it affects my image, I would be pretty disappointed by it. I don't think anyone would be that shallow to let that happen. The photo is for a good cause, so, if it stirs any controversy, so be it.\"\nThe Australian celebrity photographer Pedro Virgil who had taken the photos of the players defended his work saying about the calendar: \"It is provocative in the sense that the guys are naked... but in this case it is tasteful\"."

        "text": "The 2010 Monaco Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2010) was the sixth round of the 2010 Formula One season. It was held in the streets of Monaco on 16 May 2010 and was won by Red Bull's Mark Webber.\nReport.\nBackground.\nReigning World Champion and 2009 race winner Jenson Button went into the Monte Carlo round with a three-point lead over Ferrari's Fernando Alonso and a ten-point margin over Sebastian Vettel. In total, seven drivers were in a position to take the lead of the championship had they won in the Principality.\nFollowing concerns over the tight and narrow nature of the circuit combined with new teams Virgin Racing, Lotus and Hispania being between three and six seconds slower than the established teams over the course of a lap and therefore creating a very real possibility for a slower car compromising the flying laps of their faster counterparts, the suggestion was put forth to split the first session of qualifying into two groups of twelve cars, similar to the format used by the IndyCar Series. However, at the Spanish Grand Prix, one week before the Monaco race, the proposal was rejected by several teams. The FIA later set a maximum allowable lap time for qualifying, with any car that is slower than one minute and twenty-two seconds between the first and last corners facing penalties from the stewards. The concerns over slow traffic attracted criticism, with World Champion Keke Rosberg saying \"there used to be twenty-six drivers out there in the old days, and half of them were slow – not just half a dozen!\", while Lotus Racing's Jarno Trulli said that he felt drivers and teams have no cause for complaint if anyone is held up, saying \"they have had plenty of time among the teams about what to do for here [Monaco], and they didn't come up with a solution. So I don't think anyone should start complaining now.\"\nSeveral small changes were made to the circuit prior to the race. These include the raising of kerbs on the exit of the Nouvelle Chicane and in the second half of the Swimming Pool complex, as a deterrent to cars cutting the chicanes. The new kerbs were clearly visible in the new yellow colour. Several sections of the circuit, including the pit lane and the northern half of the circuit from the Place du Casino to the tunnel have been re-surfaced.\nBruno Senna had damaged his Hispania F110 during practice for the race in Barcelona. As his team was unable to find the flaw in the chassis, he competed in Monaco with a damaged car, producing lap times two seconds slower than his team-mate Karun Chandhok in free practice.\nFree practice.\nThe first practice sessions were held on the Thursday of race week, as is traditional in Monaco. Fernando Alonso was the fastest driver and the only man to break the barrier, though second-placed Sebastian Vettel set a time of 1:16 even, with Renault's Robert Kubica one hundredth of a second behind him. Virgin's Timo Glock was the fastest of the new teams, three and a half seconds slower than Alonso and one second behind Kamui Kobayashi, the last of the drivers for an established team. The first session was incident-free with the exception of Karun Chandhok stopping on the circuit after completing just six laps when he brushed the barriers and spun at Massanet. Kobayashi also encountered trouble, running over the chicanes at the entry to the Swimming Pool and finding the barriers. Alonso was also sighted pitting for a replacement front wing.\nThe second practice session was considered wet, though the rain was not heavy enough to justify the use of the intermediate tyres. Alonso once again topped the session, this time breaking the barrier with Nico Rosberg and Vettel rounding out the top three. Lotus' Heikki Kovalainen was the fastest of the new teams, one second adrift of Jaime Alguersuari in eighteenth position. There were no major incidents, though the anticipated traffic problem manifested on several occasions, with the Ferrari of Felipe Massa impeding Kovalainen and his Lotus as the Finn was completing a flying lap.\nThe third practice session opened with a heavy accident by Alonso, the Spaniard crashing his Ferrari at Massanet after completing just six laps; his fastest recorded time for the session would ultimately be enough for sixteenth. Virgin's Timo Glock also stopped with hydraulics issues after a sequence of installation laps and failing to set a time. Renault's Kubica was the fastest of the session, edging out Alonso's Ferrari team-mate Massa by four hundredths of a second and winner Mark Webber third. At the end of the session, just half a second covered the top seven drivers. Lotus was once again the fastest rookie team, with Heikki Kovalainen just a tenth of a second quicker than team-mate Trulli.\nQualifying.\nFollowing the practice session, Ferrari judged the damage to Alonso's car to be too extensive to repair in time for qualifying. This forced the double World Champion to revert to the team's spare chassis for the race and start from pit lane.\nWith Alonso out, several teams – notably Renault – sent their drivers out on the harder compound tyres, and the remaining six drivers to be eliminated were the six drivers for the new teams. Heikki Kovalainen was the fastest of them; it was the first time team-mate Jarno Trulli was out-qualified at Monaco by his team-mate. The Lotus cars were followed by the two Virgins and the two Hispanias. Despite his damaged car, Bruno Senna out-qualified Karun Chandhok. The anticipated traffic problems did not arise, and Felipe Massa set the fastest time of the session.\nThe second session was marked by an accident in the final few minutes, with Vitaly Petrov slipping into the tyre wall at Ste. Devote, though the session was not stopped. His time was fast enough for fourteenth although Nico Hülkenberg, Adrian Sutil and Sébastien Buemi all qualified ahead of Petrov, with Pedro de la Rosa, Kamui Kobayashi and Jaime Alguersuari also being eliminated. Mercedes' Nico Rosberg was the fastest man in the session.\nThe third and final part of qualifying was led by Robert Kubica for over half the session, a whole second ahead of the opposition, before Mark Webber managed to set a lap time of 1:13.826 to steal pole position away from him and continue Red Bull's unbroken run of pole positions with their sixth-straight start from pole. Kubica qualified in second place, with Sebastian Vettel taking third ahead of Felipe Massa. Lewis Hamilton qualified fifth ahead of Nico Rosberg and Michael Schumacher; team principal Ross Brawn later expressed frustrations by a mistake by the team that saw Rosberg inadvertently block his team-mate. Jenson Button, Rubens Barrichello and Vitantonio Liuzzi completed the top ten.\nRace.\nAt the start, Kubica attempted to block Vettel and protect second place, but the German driver held his line into Ste. Devote and won the position. Rubens Barrichello was the big winner, managing to forge through to sixth place, while Schumacher overtook his team-mate. The first lap saw Nico Hülkenberg crash in the tunnel when a front wing mounting failed. A problem with his clutch had previously forced him to abort his warm-up lap and line up at the back of the grid, and his accident triggered a safety car period that lasted for several laps, and Fernando Alonso took the opportunity to pit early, swapping his super-soft tyres in favour of the harder compound. It was a move that would dictate most strategies up and down the pit lane given that every car was planning on stopping just once. Reigning World Champion and 2009 winner Jenson Button was the race's second retirement with an overheating engine – the result of a bung being left in an air intake on the grid by an engineer – ending his day on the second lap. He also parked his car on the exit to the pit lane, meaning Bruno Senna had to cross the yellow line to avoid the McLaren after completing his pitstop, due to this he did not receive a penalty.\nThe first round of stops began earlier than anticipated, with the majority of teams and drivers attempting to time their stops in such a way that they would come out ahead of Alonso's Ferrari. Nico Rosberg was the exception to the rule, preferring instead to stay out in an attempt to open a buffer between himself and the Spaniard. The gamble did not pay off, however, as Rosberg eventually emerged from the pits to find himself behind Alonso and a train of cars that had exited from the pits immediately in front of him. While pit strategy dictated the running order, both Saubers and both Virgins retired from the race.\nAs Webber began to solidify his lead, Rubens Barrichello suffered a suspension failure due to a loose drain cover at the top of Beau Rivage, and the Brazilian's out-of-control Williams hit the barrier and spun around, coming to a halt facing the wrong way in the middle of the track at Massanet. Karun Chandhok then ran over Barrichello's discarded steering wheel, which he had thrown out of the car after the crash. The safety car was deployed for the second time, bunching the field back up. Webber survived the restarts with his lead intact, though the safety car would again take control of the race a few laps later. A marshal at Massanet reported that a manhole cover had come loose, and with the pressure generated by a speeding Formula One car being more than enough to rip it free of its mountings, race control deployed the safety car while the situation could be assessed. It was decided that the cover was safe, and the race resumed within three laps of the safety car taking to the circuit. It was later discovered that the loose manhole cover had been the cause of Barrichello's accident, being lifted up as the car passed over it, striking the left rear wheel and breaking the suspension.\nBruno Senna and Heikki Kovalainen joined the growing list of retirements, both exiting the race on the same lap with mechanical troubles. The safety car would again be deployed during the 75th lap and remain in place until the race's final corner when Jarno Trulli and Hispania's Karun Chandhok collided. Trulli attempted a pass at Rascasse that resulted in his Lotus mounting Chandhok's car and his wheels narrowly missing Chandhok's head. Both drivers walked away from the crash. The incident occurred just in front of race leader Webber, who avoided being caught up in the tangle. Webber went on to win a race with all but a few seconds of the last few laps run under safety car conditions during which Vitaly Petrov retired his Renault with brake problems.\nDuring the eight or nine seconds between Webber crossing the safety car line, with the green restart lights illuminated, and Webber finishing the race, Schumacher overtook Alonso in the final corner for sixth place to finish 5.7 seconds behind the winner. The rule 40.7 states that after the safety car has returned to the pitlane, drivers may only overtake once they have passed the white safety car line spanning the width of the circuit; in Monaco, this line is at the exit to Rascasse. Replays showing Schumacher's manoeuvre were shown shortly after the race and controversy started with Ferrari claiming that overtaking on the last lap was not permitted, according to rule 40.13, which states: \"If the race ends whilst the safety car is deployed it will enter the pit lane at the end of the last lap and the cars will take the chequered flag as normal without overtaking.\" Mercedes principal Ross Brawn produced documents to show that the restart had taken place (thus the 40.13 rule was not applicable in his opinion) and Schumacher's position beyond the safety car line before the overtaking.\nWebber's victory meant that he was the first Australian to win the Monaco Grand Prix since Sir Jack Brabham in 1959. Webber also assumed the lead in the championship on seventy-eight points, the same amount as his team-mate Sebastian Vettel (however, with two wins this season to Vettel's one, Webber is still classified as sole championship leader). Robert Kubica finished third ahead of Felipe Massa and Lewis Hamilton, with Alonso sixth after Schumacher's penalty. Alonso's result moved him to third in the standings, just ahead of the non-finishing Button. Red Bull's one-two finish also meant that they leap-frogged Ferrari in the constructors' standings, establishing a twenty-two point lead. Combined with Button's retirement, Lewis Hamilton's fifth place meant that McLaren fell from first to third overall.\nPost-race.\nThe stewards, including champion Damon Hill, held an enquiry after the race, and gave Schumacher a 20-second penalty for illegally passing Alonso, demoting him to 12th position. Mercedes announced its intention to appeal against the decision, although the penalty cannot be rescinded as it is classed as a drive-through penalty, a type of penalty which is not open to appeal. The team later chose not to pursue an appeal after the FIA agreed to hold talks on the subject of the safety car rules. The FIA later admitted that the rules suffered from a \"lack of clarity\" and sought to change the rules in order to clarify the regulations and make it easier for teams to understand exactly what was required of them in such a scenario.\nThe safety car rule in Formula One is unique compared to other sanctioning bodies of motorsport in regards to last-lap yellow chequer finishes. Most sanctioning bodies require the safety car to lead the leader across the finish line on the final lap in case of a yellow chequer. In Formula One, the safety car does not lead the leader across the finish line on the last lap.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\nNotes:"

The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29, 31 and August 4 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. There were 71 competitors from 19 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have to up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won in a tie between Li Ning of China, in the nation's debut in the Games, and Koji Gushiken, with Japan's first gold medal in the rings since 1972 (and fourth overall). The bronze medal went to American Mitchell Gaylord, the nation's first medal in the event since 1932. The Soviet Union's eight-Games podium streak in the event ended with no Soviets competing due to the boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). None of the six finalists from 1980 returned; five of the six were from boycotting nations, while the other (Dan Grecu of Romania) had retired after suffering a muscle tear during the 1980 final. With the absence of the Soviets, the field was open to the traditional power Japan and rising powers China and the United States. Japan's Koji Gushiken had tied Soviet Dmitry Bilozerchev for the 1983 world championship, with Li Ning of China third.\nThe People's Republic of China and San Marino each made their debut in the men's rings. The United States made its 14th appearance, breaking a tie with the absent Hungary for most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 rings and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. \nThe 1984 Games expanded the number of finalists from six to eight. Nations were still limited to two finalists each. Others were ranked 9th through 71st. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nSeventy-one gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29 and 31. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 4. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score. The results were notable for the shared gold medal between the top two scorers."

The United States made its 14th appearance, breaking a tie with the absent Hungary for most of any nation; the Americans had missed only the inaugural 1896 event and the boycotted 1980 Games.\nCompetition format.\nEach nation entered a team of six gymnasts or up to three individual gymnasts. All entrants in the gymnastics competitions performed both a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise for each apparatus. The scores for all 12 exercises were summed to give an individual all-around score. These exercise scores were also used for qualification for the apparatus finals. The two exercises (compulsory and voluntary) for each apparatus were summed to give an apparatus score. \nThe 1984 Games expanded the number of finalists from six to eight. Nations were still limited to two finalists each. Others were ranked 9th through 71st. Half of the preliminary score carried over to the final.\nResults.\nSeventy-one gymnasts competed in the compulsory and optional rounds on July 29 and 31. The eight highest scoring gymnasts advanced to the final on August 4. Each country was limited to two competitors in the final. Half of the points earned by each gymnast during both the compulsory and optional rounds carried over to the final. This constitutes the \"prelim\" score."

        "text": "The men's horizontal bar competition was one of eight events for male competitors in artistic gymnastics at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The qualification and final rounds took place on July 29, 31 and August 4 at UCLA’s Pauley Pavilion. There were 71 competitors from 19 nations, with nations competing in the team event having 6 gymnasts while other nations could have to up to 3 gymnasts. The event was won by Shinji Morisue of Japan, continuing the nation's dominant streak where it left off before the 1980 boycott. Morisue scored a perfect 20 in the event (requiring all three exercises to receive perfect 10s); he was one of only three gymnasts to achieve a perfect 20 on an apparatus (and the only male gymnast to do so) during the 20-point era (1952–1988). The gold medal was Japan's sixth on the horizontal bar, all within eight Games (including one in which Japan did not compete at all). Koji Gushiken added a bronze medal for Japan. The People's Republic of China debuted strongly, with a silver medal from Tong Fei.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). None of the six finalists from 1980 returned; all six were from boycotting nations. Soviets had won the last two world championships (and shared silver at both, as well); France's Philippe Vatuone had tied for second in 1983, with Shinji Morisue of Japan and Tong Fei of China even in fourth place. The host nation's hopes were in Peter Vidmar, a world championship finalist.\nThe People's Republic of China and San Marino each made their debut in the men's horizontal bar.

It was the sixth appearance of the event, which had not been on the programme in 1896. The competition was held from Wednesday, July 10, 1924 to Thursday, July 11, 1924. 67 fencers from 18 nations competed. Nations were limited to four competitors each. The event was won by Charles Delporte of Belgium, the nation's second victory in the individual épée (matching France and Cuba for most among nations). Silver went to Roger Ducret of France. Nils Hellsten earned Sweden's first medal in the event with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFour of the 12 finalists from the 1920 Games returned: gold medalist Armand Massard of France, fourth-place finisher Ernest Gevers of Belgium, ninth-place finisher Gustaf Lindblom of Sweden, and tenth-place finisher Charles Delporte of Belgium. Of the first three World Champions since that event started in 1921, two were present: 1922 champion Raoul Heide of Norway and 1923 (reigning) champion Wouter Brouwer of the Netherlands. (1921 winner Lucien Gaudin competed on the French team in the team event, but was not one of the four fencers in the individual event.) \nUruguay made its debut in the event. Belgium, Great Britain, and the United States each appeared for the fifth time, tied for most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was held over four rounds. In each round, each pool held a round-robin, with bouts to 1 touch. Double-touches counted as touches against both fencers. The format returned to using barrages to separate fencers tied in the advancement spot (as had been done in 1908), rather than using head-to-head results of bouts already fenced were used (as in 1912 and 1920). The size of the pools remained at the relatively large levels introduced in 1920, with the final and semifinals consisting of 12 fencers each.\nResults.\nRound 1.\nThe top six fencers, by number of wins, in each pool advanced. Double-losses were allowed. Tie-breakers were held within a group tied on a number of wins that broke between qualification and non-qualification.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe top six fencers, by number of wins, in each pool advanced. Double-losses were allowed. Tie-breakers were held within a group tied on a number of wins that broke between qualification and non-qualification.\nSemifinals.\nThe top six fencers, by number of wins, in each pool advanced. Double-losses were allowed. Tie-breakers were held within a group tied on a number of wins that broke between qualification and non-qualification.\nFinal.\nDouble-losses were allowed.

He played club level rugby union (RU) for Wakefield RFC, as a wing, i.e. number 11 or 14, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 569), as a , i.e. number 2 or 5.\nBiography.\nJohn Joseph Duggan's birth was registered in Wakefield district, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. John, the first of eight children, was born at home in Georges Square adjacent to Wakefield Cathedral to mother Abigail (registered as spinster) and father Michael (registered as labourer). The family moved later to the Eastmoor Estate where John grew up. He migrated to New Zealand in his mid twenties initially settling in Whanganui where he played in the local professional soccer league (not rugby union as intended). John soon moved from Whanganui to Auckland where he met and married Phyllis Chapman. The couple had three sons. John established himself as a businessman eventually rising to the position of managing director of FS Tyler Ltd a now defunct retail furniture store in Anzac Avenue.\nDuggan died in Auckland on 21 July 2022, at the age of 93.\nPlaying career.\nAt the age of 13, Duggan played Stand-Off/Fly-half, and captained St Austin's school but he did not play any further rugby until leaving school at 16 when he joined Wakefield RFC as a wing. In the 1945/46 season, he scored three tries in four appearances. The following season saw fourteen tries in twenty-two games. The 1947/48 season was his last amateur season, he played three games in 1947 scoring two tries.\nHe signed for Wakefield Trinity at Christmas 1947 when he was 18. In his first full season for Trinity, he made 28 appearances and scored seventeen tries, four of them in one game against the Featherstone Rovers.\nThe \"Wakefield Express\" described how he became a firm favourite with the Wakefield Trinity crowd for \"his strong running, elusiveness and never say die temperament\".\nIn September 1949, he was selected to play for Yorkshire but had to withdraw having broken his nose in a game against St. Helens.\nCounty honours.\nJohnny Duggan played , i.e. number 2, in Yorkshire's 3–12 defeat by Lancashire in the 1949 County Championship Final during the 1948–49 season at Thrum Hall, Halifax on Tuesday 3 May 1949, in front of a crowd of 7,000.\nCounty Cup Final.\nJohnny Duggan played , i.e. number 2, in Wakefield Trinity's 17–3 victory over Keighley in the 1951 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1951–52 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield on Saturday 27 October 1951.\nJohnny Duggan emigrated to New Zealand in the early 1950s and began playing rugby union again, and on Saturday 19 July 1952 the Wakefield Express carried the headline, \"Johnny Duggan to tour with New Zealanders?\", in the article Johnny Duggan stated \"I have filled in a form for reinstatement in a rugby union club and the Wanganui officials are backing me up. If it comes through there is every likelihood of seeing me in England with the New Zealand touring team next season – at least, that is what the locals says who have been very impressed with my displays in practice\", however he did not participate in the 1953–54 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America."

        "title": "Young rider classification in the Tour de France",
        "text": "The young rider classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1975. Excluding the years 1989 to 1999, the leader of the young rider classification wears a white jersey (). The requirements to be eligible for the young rider classification have changed over the years but have always been such that experienced cyclists were not eligible, sometimes by excluding cyclists over a certain age, cyclists who had entered the Tour de France before, or cyclists who had been professional for more than two years. In the most recent years, only cyclists who will remain below 26 in the year the race is held are eligible.\nIn the Tour de France Femmes, the white jersey is awarded to the highest placed rider in the general classification under the age of 23.\nHistory.\nFrom 1968 to 1975, there was a white jersey awarded in the Tour de France to the lead rider in the combination classification (best rider in the overall, points and climbing competitions). In 1975, this classification was removed, and replaced by the \"young rider classification\". Any neo-professional (less than three years professional) competed in this classification, which was calculated using the rankings for the general classification. The leader in the young rider classification wore a white jersey.\nThe rules for the young rider classification changed in 1983, when the competition was only open for first-time competitors, but in 1987 it became open for all cyclists less than 26 years of age at 1 January of the year following that tour. From 1989-1999, the white jersey was no longer awarded, although the competition was still calculated. Since 2000, the white jersey has again been awarded, open for all cyclists less than 26 years of age at 1 January of the year following that Tour. In 1997, the name of the competition officially changed to 'Souvenir Fabio Casartelli'.\nSponsorship.\nThe optical retail chain Krys has sponsored the white jersey since 2015. The jersey was previously sponsored by Czech car manufacturer Škoda from 2004 to 2014.\nJerseys ranking.\nThe white jersey is the fourth most important jersey in the Tour de France, after yellow, green and polka dot jerseys. If a rider lead one of the other classifications and the young rider classification, he will wear the yellow, green or the polka dot jersey. The second rider (or the following eligible rider) in the young rider classification will wear the white jersey with the following exception:\nIn this case the third rider (or the following eligible rider) will be in white jersey.\nWinners.\nSince the young rider classification was introduced in 1975, it has been won by 40 different cyclists. On seven occasions a cyclist has won the young rider classification and the general classification — Laurent Fignon in 1983, Jan Ullrich in 1997, Alberto Contador in 2007, Andy Schleck in 2010, Egan Bernal in 2019 and Tadej Pogačar in 2020 and 2021. The only cyclists to win the young rider classification and the mountains classification in the same year are Nairo Quintana in 2013 and Pogačar in 2020 and 2021.\nThe only cyclists to win the young rider classification multiple times are Marco Pantani (two wins), Jan Ullrich (three wins — also finishing first once or second twice in the general classification), Andy Schleck (three wins — also finishing first once and second once in the general classification), Nairo Quintana (two wins — also finishing second in the general classification both years), and Tadej Pogačar (four wins — also finishing first twice and second twice in the general classification). Quintana is the only rider to win the classification in non-consecutive years. Pogačar holds the absolute record of wearing the white jersey for 75 days in total.\nTadej Pogačar also has the record of leading the young rider classification for 72 consecutive stages, between stage 13 of the 2020 Tour de France and the end of the 2023 Tour de France.\nDays in white jersey.\n\"Note: 1989-1999 editions, when the classification didn't have a distinctive jersey are also taken into account.\"\nRiders leading in all stages of an edition.\n Dietrich Thurau 1977 (28 stages)\n Phil Anderson 1982 (23 stages)\n Jan Ullrich 1997 (22 stages)\n Tadej Pogačar 2021 (21 stages)\n Tadej Pogačar 2022 (21 stages)\n Tadej Pogačar 2023 (21 stages)"

        "title": "Points classification in the Tour de France",
        "text": "The points classification () is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, which started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey (), which has become a metonym for the points classification competition.\nThe system has inspired many other cycling races; the other two Grand Tours have also installed points classifications: the Vuelta a España since 1955, also using a green jersey, and the Giro d'Italia since 1966.\nHistory.\nAfter scandals in the 1904 Tour de France, the rules of the 1905 Tour de France were changed: the winner was no longer determined by the time system, but with the points system. The cyclists received points, equal to their ranking in the stage, and the cyclist with the fewest points was the leader of the race. After the 1912 Tour de France, the system was changed back to the time system that is still in use.\nIn the 1953 Tour de France, to celebrate the 50th birthday of the Tour de France, the points system was reintroduced, but this time as an additional classification. Because the leader in the general classification wears a yellow jersey, the leader in the points classification also received a special jersey, a green jersey. The color green was chosen because the sponsor was a lawn mower producer, much as the yellow jersey was chosen to mirror the colour of the sponsoring newspaper from which it arose.\nIn the first years, the cyclist only received penalty points for not finishing with a high place, so the cyclist with the fewest points was awarded the green jersey. From 1959 on, the system was changed so the cyclists were awarded points for high place finishes (with first place getting the most points, and lower placings getting successively fewer points), so the cyclist with the most points was awarded the green jersey.\n1968 is the only year the jersey was not green: for that edition of the race, the jersey was red to match a new sponsor.\nWhereas the yellow jersey is awarded for the lowest cumulative time in the race, the green jersey reflects points gained for high placings on each stage and intermediate \"hot spots\", especially during the flat stages of the Tour. The intermediate sprints were formerly for the intermediate sprints classification, with the points for the points classification a 'side-effect'; however, the intermediate sprints classification was later scrapped, but the intermediate sprints remained part of the points classification.\nThe points classification is widely thought of as the \"sprinter's competition\", since the most points are scored in flat stages, in which the riders generally remain together in one large peloton, leaving the best sprinters at the end to fight for the stage win. However, to win the competition a rider will need a reasonable level of all-round skills as well as strong sprinting, since he will need to finish within the time limit on mountain stages to remain in contention, and ideally will be able to contest intermediate sprints during mountain stages as well. For example, Mario Cipollini was one of the best pure sprinters of his era but was never in contention for the points classification because he was unwilling to make it through the mountain stages and finish the race (however, he did finish the Giro d'Italia and won its points classification several times).\nOn four occasions, the winner of the points classification was also the winner of the general classification: three times by Eddy Merckx, and once by Bernard Hinault.\nIn 1969, Eddy Merckx won the general classification, the points classification and the mountains classification (the polka dot jersey was born in 1975), a unique performance in the Tour de France, but as he was leading the race, he cannot conceivably wear all jerseys, so while he wore the yellow jersey, the green-jersey is worn by the person who is second in the points classification standings.\nPeter Sagan set the record for the most stages in the lead of a Tour de France classification, wearing the green-jersey for 100 days through stage 18 of the 2018 Tour de France.\nTwo winners of the points classification, Sean Kelly and Sam Bennett both hail from the town of Carrick-on-Suir, Ireland, a town with a population of only 5,771 residents.\nSponsorship.\nThe jersey gained its green colour from its first sponsor, La Belle Jardinière, a French clothing store. The jersey was sponsored by French betting company Pari Mutuel Urbain (PMU) for nearly 25 years, with Czech car manufacturer Škoda becoming the current sponsor in 2015.\nJerseys ranking.\nThe green jersey is the second most important jersey in the Tour de France, after the yellow jersey. If a rider is the leader in the general and points classifications he will wear the yellow jersey. The second rider in the points classification will wear the green jersey with some exceptions:\nIn both cases, the third rider (or the following eligible rider) will wear the green jersey.\nPoints system.\nCurrent.\n, the points classification is calculated by adding up the points collected in the stage and subtracting penalty points. Points are awarded for the first cyclists to cross the finish-line or the intermediate sprint line, and for the cyclists with the fastest times in the prologue or individual time trials, under the following scheme:\nRiders can lose points for various infractions to the rules, which means some riders finish the Tour with a negative points tally.\nBefore the start of the Tour de France, the organization declares which stages are considered \"flat\", \"medium mountain\" or \"high mountain\". Flat stages typically have few or no categorized climbs (several 4th category and an occasional 3rd category), medium mountain stages have numerous climbs, typically 2nd and 3rd category, and high mountain stages have numerous large climbs, often 1st category or hors catégorie.\nWhen the order in which cyclists crossed the line cannot be determined or when cyclists score exactly the same time in the prologue/individual time trial, the cyclists divide the points (rounded up to the nearest 1/2 point). A cyclist that does not finish a stage is removed from the points classification. After every stage, the leader in the points classification is given a green jersey. In the event of a tie in the ranking, the cyclist with the most stage victories is the leader. If that is also a tie, the number of intermediate sprint victories indicates the leader. If that is also a tie, the general classification determines the leader. At the end of the Tour de France, the cyclist leading the points classification is the winner of the green jersey.\nHistorical.\nThe rules have varied over the years. When the system started in 1953, the ranks of each cyclist in a stage were added, and the cyclist with the lowest number of points won. Later, points were given to the first few cyclists in each stage. Even later, the point system started to differentiate for stage type, typically assigning more points to flat stages. Intermediate sprints were also given points.\nIn 2009, the system had evolved to the following, with either two or three intermediate sprints per stage:\nStarting from the 2011 Tour de France, a system very similar to the current one was used:\nWinners.\nRepeat winners.\nPeter Sagan is the most successful cyclist in the history of the points classification competition with seven green jerseys. Erik Zabel has the most podium finishes, with 12 (6 wins, 2 seconds and 4 thirds). Mark Cavendish has the largest gap between wins; 10 years separating his first and second green jerseys.\nDays in green jersey.\n\"after the end of 2023 Tour de France\"\nRiders leaders in all stages of an edition.\n André Darrigade 1959 (22 stages)\n Freddy Maertens 1976 (27 stages)\nSome riders wore the jersey in some stages as second in point classification (because the leader wore yellow jersey) and led all other stages:\n Freddy Maertens 1978\n Eric Vanderaerden 1986\n Peter Sagan 2019\n Wout Van Aert 2022\nSagan would have did the same in 2014 and in 2018 but in the first case he wore the white jersey as leader and in the second case he wore the rainbow jersey."

In this classification, points are awarded to the leading riders over designated climbs. The climbs are put into different classifications based on difficulty and their position on that day's stage. Bonus points are given to mountain top finishes and to the first riders over the \"Cima Coppi\", traditionally adjudged as the highest point of the entire Giro.\nThe classification was first calculated in 1933; from 1974 to 2011, the leader of the mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia wore the maglia verde (from ): in 2012, as part of a sponsorship deal, the jersey color was changed to blue (maglia azzurra).\nHistory.\nThe mountains classification was added to the Giro d'Italia in 1933. In the inaugural year of the classification, the organizers chose select climbs and awarded points to the first three riders who crossed the climbs. Alfredo Binda was first over each climb and won the first mountains classification. In 1974, the organizers added a green jersey to designate the leader of the classification. The green jersey was used until 2012, when the classification's sponsor, Banca Mediolanum, renewed its sponsorship for another four years and desired the jersey to be blue rather than green.\nWinners.\nMultiple winners.\nAs of 2023, 15 cyclists have won the mountains classification more than once.\nBy nationality.\nRiders from fifteen different countries have won the Mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia.\nDistribution of points.\nThe points that are gained by consecutive riders reaching a mountain top are distributed according to 5 categories:\nThe organization of the race determines which mountains are included for the mountains classification and in which category they are. The points for the \"Cima Coppi\" are awarded once every Giro, for the summit at the highest altitude in that Giro."
