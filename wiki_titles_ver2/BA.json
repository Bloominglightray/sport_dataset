        "title": "1985 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1985 Tour de France was the 72nd edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 28 June and 21 July. The course ran over and consisted of a prologue and 22 stages. The race was won by Bernard Hinault (riding for the team), who equalled the record by Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx of five overall victories. Second was Hinault's teammate Greg LeMond, ahead of Stephen Roche ().\nHinault won the race leader's yellow jersey on the first day, in the opening prologue time trial, but lost the lead to Eric Vanderaerden () after stage 1 because of time bonuses. Hinault's teammate Kim Andersen then took over the yellow jersey following a successful breakaway on stage 4. Hinault regained the race lead after winning the time trial on stage 8, establishing a significant lead over his rivals. However, a crash on stage 14 into Saint-Étienne broke Hinault's nose, with congestion leading to bronchitis, which severely hampered his performances. Nonetheless, he was able to win the race overall ahead of teammate LeMond and Roche. For LeMond's assistance, Hinault publicly pledged to support LeMond for overall victory the following year. The large amount of time trials in this edition of the race was decisive for its outcome, leading to a decrease in time trial kilometres for subsequent Tours.\nIn the Tour's other classifications, Sean Kelly () won a record-equalling third points classification. The mountains classification was won by Luis Herrera (). LeMond was the winner of the combination classification, Jozef Lieckens () of the intermediate sprints classification, and Fabio Parra () was the best debutant, winning the young rider classification. won both the team and team points classifications.\nTeams.\nThe organisers of the Tour, the Société du Tour de France, a subsidiary of the Amaury Group, were free to select which teams they invited for the event. 18 teams with 10 cyclists on each started the race, meaning a total of 180 cyclists, which was a record number at the time. Of these, 67 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders in the race had an average age of 26.76 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Miguel Induráin () to the 38-year-old Lucien Van Impe (). The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest. Two former Tour winners, van Impe (who won in 1976) and Joop Zoetemelk of (who had won in 1980), both set a new record, by each starting in the race for the fifteenth time.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nLaurent Fignon () had won the previous year's Tour de France, his second victory in a row, by a substantial margin of more than ten minutes ahead of Bernard Hinault (), a four-time winner of the Tour. However, he was unable to defend his title, as an operation on an inflamed Achilles tendon left him sidelined. According to Dutch newspaper \"Het Parool\", Fignon missing the race was well received, considering that otherwise the race was expected to be as one-sided as the year before.\nIn Fignon's absence, Hinault was considered the clear favourite to achieve his fifth overall victory, which would draw him level with Jacques Anquetil and Eddy Merckx for the record number of Tour de France wins. Hinault himself commented ahead of the prologue: \"If I sound sure of myself, it's because I am.\" Earlier in the year, he had won the Giro d'Italia. Hinault's team had been significantly strengthened for 1985, with the signings of Steve Bauer, Kim Andersen, and Bernard Vallet. The biggest addition to 's roster however was Greg LeMond. Having turned professional with alongside Hinault and Fignon in 1981, he had enjoyed a steady rise in the cycling world, including a win in the road world championship in 1983 and a third place in the previous year's Tour. During that race, 's team owner Bernard Tapie had approached LeMond, offering him the highest-paid contract in cycling history to set him up as a successor to Hinault. LeMond was therefore considered \"the other choice as a possible winner\". LeMond himself stated that he would work for Hinault, but that he did not doubt that Hinault would do the same for him should he lose his chances. Equally, Hinault declared before the start that either himself or LeMond would win. The amount of individual time trials, four stages totaling , was considered in Hinault's favour, since he excelled at the discipline. Due to the race start in Brittany, Hinault's home region and the large amount of time trialling, commentators jokingly referred to the edition as the \"Tour de Hinault\".\nThe third highly ranked favourite was Phil Anderson (), who had just won both the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré and Tour de Suisse, the most important preparation races for the Tour. Among the other favourites, there were mainly riders who were considered climbers, who ascended well up high mountains, but were inferior in time trials. These included Luis Herrera (), Robert Millar (), Peter Winnen (), and Pedro Delgado (). Other favourites included Ángel Arroyo (), Pedro Muñoz (), Claude Criquielion (), Stephen Roche (), and Sean Kelly (). Kelly was ranked number one in the UCI Road World Rankings, after taking victory at Paris–Nice and winning three stages of the Vuelta a España. His Irish compatriot Roche had displayed good form earlier in the year by winning the Critérium International and the Tour Midi-Pyrénées. Charly Mottet (), winner of the , considered the junior Tour de France, in 1984, was considered an outside bet for his team in the absence of team leader Fignon, given his young age.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1985 Tour de France started on 28 June, and had one rest day, in Villard-de-Lans. The race started in Brittany in North-West France, Hinault's home region, with a prologue time trial in Plumelec. The route then headed north towards Roubaix, then south-east to Lorraine, then south through the Vosges and Jura mountains into the Alps for stages 11 through 13. From there, the Tour passed through the Massif Central en route to the Pyrenees for three high-mountain stages. After leaving the high mountains, the route moved north to Bordeaux, before travelling inland, with a time trial at Lac de Vassivière on the penultimate day, followed by a train transfer to Orléans for the final, ceremonial stage into Paris. It was the first time since 1981 that the Tour was run clockwise around France. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 17.\nThe 1985 Tour was the last one to contain split stages, where two stages on the same day had the same number and were distinguished by an \"a\" and \"b\". Until 1991, there were still two stages held on the same day, but given separate stage numbers. It was also the first time that two mountain stages were held on the same day, stages 18a and 18b in the Pyrenees.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1985 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. There were two ways to gain time bonuses, which subtracted seconds from a rider's overall time. One was at stage finishes, where the first three riders across the line received 30, 20, and 10 seconds bonus respectively. The split stage 18 awarded full-time bonuses for each of its two legs. Secondly, riders were able to gain 10, 6, and 3 seconds bonus for the first three to cross the line at intermediate sprints. Unlike the previous year, where these were only given out during flat stages, the time bonuses at intermediate sprints were awarded during every road stage of the 1985 Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. The system for the points classification was changed for the 1985 Tour: in previous years, more points were earned in flat stages than in mountain stages, which gave sprinters an advantage in this classification; while in 1985, all stages gave 25 points for the winner, down to 1 point for 25th place. Unlike in many other years, between 1984 and 1986, intermediate sprints did not award points for this classification. Sean Kelly won the classification for a record-equalling third time. His 434 points were 69.4% of the maximum possible amount obtainable, a record .\nThere was also a mountains classification. The points system for the classification was changed: mountains in the toughest categories gave more points, to reduce the influence of the minor hills on this classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. \"Hors catégorie\" climbs awarded 40 points to the first rider across, down to 1 point for the 15th rider. First-category mountains awarded 30 points to the first rider to reach the top, with the other three categories awarding 20, 7, and 4 points respectively to the first man across the summit. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Luis Herrera won the mountains classification.\nThe combination jersey for the combination classification was introduced in this year's Tour. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications: a first place in one of the classifications awarded 25 points, down to 1 point for 25th place. Only the general, mountains, points, and intermediate sprint classifications were included here. The winner of this classification was Greg LeMond.\nAnother classification was the young rider classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey. The winner of this classification was Fabio Parra, who finished in eighth place in the general classification.\nThe sixth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but only awarded points at intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey. The intermediate sprints awarded more points the more the Tour progressed, from 3, 2, and 1 points for the first three riders across during stages 1 to 5 to 12, 8, and 4 points respectively during the last five stages. The classification was won by Jozef Lieckens ().\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. led both classifications after the prologue as well as from stage 8 until the finish.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each mass-start stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Maarten Ducrot won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Tourmalet on stage 17. This prize was won by Pello Ruiz Cabestany.\nThe 1985 Tour was the last to feature what was called \"flying stages\", introduced in 1977: on stages 4 and 11, there was a finish line at the midway point of the course, which was treated as a stage finish but the race continued uninterrupted afterwards. Kim Andersen was the first to cross the line on stage 4, while Eric Vanderaerden took the honours on stage 11. They received the same prizes as regular stage winners, including prize money, time bonuses and points for the points classification, but the times were not taken for the general classification. Officially, they were also supposed to be counted as stage victories, but the public did not accept the concept and both are today not included in stage winner statistics. The idea was scrapped the following year.\nIn total, the Tour organisers paid out 3,003,050 French francs in prize money, with 40,000 and an apartment valued at 120,000 francs given to the winner of the general classification.\nRace overview.\nOpening stages.\nHinault laid down a claim towards his fifth Tour victory immediately by winning the prologue time trial. LeMond suffered mechanical issues, as a jammed chain slowed him in the final section of the course. He nevertheless finished fifth, 21 seconds behind Hinault. Eric Vanderaerden was second, four seconds slower than Hinault, ahead of Roche in third place. Alfons De Wolf () arrived five minutes late for his start and then lost another two minutes to Hinault, eliminating him from the race before reaching the first stage proper due to having missed the time limit.\nRudy Matthijs () won the first stage from a bunch sprint, ahead of Vanderaerden, who with the help of time bonuses took over the race leader's yellow jersey. Maarten Ducrot () had gone on a solo breakaway and held a maximum lead of 16 minutes, but was caught with to go. Ángel Arroyo, who won second place in 1983, abandoned the race after just into the first stage. Matthijs made it two stage wins in a row on the second stage, this time coming out on top in a sprint ahead of Sean Kelly.\n won the stage 3 team time trial by over a minute ahead of the next-best team. Their team coach, Paul Köchli, had made the decision to fit faster wheels to the slower riders, balancing out the performance of the squad. While Vanderaerden held on to the yellow jersey courtesy of the time bonuses he had collected earlier, the eight riders behind him on general classification came from . Hinault, however, was bothered by the large amount of reporters and photographers behind the finish line, punching one of them on the chin. Stage 4 saw the first successful breakaway, with a seven-rider group finishing 46 seconds ahead of the main field. While Gerrit Solleveld () won the stage, Kim Andersen took the overall lead for . Future five-time Tour winner Miguel Induráin abandoned during stage 4.\nStage 5 into Roubaix, which featured some cobbled roads, was won by Henri Manders (). He had been in a breakaway with Teun van Vliet (), who had done most of the work on the front, before Manders left him about before the finish when van Vliet developed spasms in his legs. Stage 6 saw a controversial sprint finish in Reims. During the sprint, Kelly and Vanderaerden pushed against each other, forcing Kelly towards the barriers. Vanderaerden crossed the line first and received the stage honours and the yellow jersey on the podium. Later however, the race jury decided to relegate both Kelly and Vanderaerden to the back of their group in the stage results, giving the stage victory to Francis Castaing (), while Andersen kept the race lead. LeMond, who had mixed himself into the sprint, was raised from fourth to second, giving him a twenty-second time bonus. This allowed him to move into third place in the general classification, two seconds ahead of Hinault. With raced into stage 7, an eight-rider group attacked, including Ludwig Wijnants (), but were brought back later. Luis Herrera was active later in the stage, establishing a breakaway after . From this group, Wijnants, again in the breakaway, attacked with to go. Just as Herrera brought him back later, Wijnants attacked again to claim the stage win.\nVosges and Jura.\nStage 8 saw the first long individual time trial of the Tour. At , it was the longest individual time trial in the Tour since 1960. Bernard Hinault won the stage by a high margin, with second-placed Roche 2:20 minutes slower. Hinault even caught and passed Sean Kelly, who had started two minutes ahead of him, and proceeded to gain another minute on him. Third was Mottet, ahead of LeMond, who lost 2:34 minutes to Hinault. While Hinault regained the race lead, LeMond was now his closest challenger, 2:32 minutes behind on the general classification, with Anderson and Roche already almost four minutes behind. Dietrich Thurau () was given a one-minute time penalty for drafting behind Mottet. Angry at the decision, Thurau physically attacked the judge who had handed out the penalty, grabbing him by the throat, and was subsequently ejected from the race on stage 10.\nThe next stage to Épinal was won by Maarten Ducrot, 38 seconds ahead of René Bittinger (). Jeronimo Ibañez Escribano () was taken to the hospital, following a crash from the finish. On stage 10, Jørgen V. Pedersen won the day for in a sprint finish, beating Johan Lammerts (). Hinault finished 15th and retained his lead in the overall standings. Paul Sherwen () was involved in a crash just into the stage and suffered throughout, reaching the finish more than an hour behind Pedersen. Since he arrived so late, he had to traverse in between spectators who thought no more riders would come across the route. He was well outside the time limit, but the race jury, against the advice of the race director, decided to allow him to start the next stage, naming his \"courage\" after his early fall as the reason for their decision.\nAlps.\nThe race entered the high mountains on stage 11 with the first leg in the Alps to Avoriaz. The route crossed the summits of the Pas de Morgins and Le Corbier before arriving in Morzine for the final ascent. Hinault strengthened his claim on the overall victory by escaping early with Luis Herrera, who by now was too far down in the general classification to be a threat. Instead, Herrera collected the points for the mountains classification, a lead which he would hold until the end of the race. Herrera also won the stage, seven seconds ahead of Hinault. LeMond lost 1:41, coming in fifth in a group with Delgado and Fabio Parra (). Hinault's lead therefore increased to exactly four minutes on second-placed LeMond in the overall standings.\nEven though stage 12 featured seven categorised climbs, it saw no changes on the top of the general classification, as Parra and Herrera fought out the victory between teammates. This time, it was Parra who emerged the winner, on the same time as Herrera. Kelly and Niki Rüttimann () followed 38 seconds down, one second ahead of the group containing the other favourites, led home by Roche. During the stage, Joël Pelier (), riding his first Tour, had followed Herrera, thinking he was joining a breakaway, not realising that Herrera was only sprinting for mountain points. Hinault, who was generally accepted as the \"patron\", meaning the most influential rider, was unhappy with the acceleration in the field, as he wanted the tempo to remain slow. This led to an altercation between the two, with Hinault riding up to Pelier and to complain.\nWeakened by his attacking riding style over the previous days, Hinault placed only second in the mountain time trial to Villard-de-Lans, about a minute behind Vanderaerden. Yet, his advantage over LeMond, who again had mechanical issues, increased to 5:23 minutes on the general classification. Roche lost 16 seconds to Hinault, Anderson 24 seconds and Kelly 35 seconds. Roche remained the closest competitor to the duo, sitting third overall, 6:08 minutes behind Hinault, with Kelly fourth, at 6:35 minutes. Anderson was sixth, behind Bauer.\nTransition through Massif Central.\nFollowing the only rest day of the Tour, stage 14 took the riders to Saint-Étienne in the Massif Central. The stage, following a hilly route, saw Luis Herrera attack again and gain more points for the mountains classification. Although he crashed on the final descent of the day, he prevailed to reach the finish line first, soaked in blood, 47 seconds ahead of a small group of riders containing LeMond. Hinault followed in a group almost two minutes later. As they approached the finish, Bauer's rear wheel hit a piece of traffic furniture. As his bike moved sideways, it touched Anderson's, who crashed and brought down Hinault with him. The latter suffered a broken nose, but was able to finish the stage. As the accident had occurred within the final kilometre, the time he lost in the crash was not counted. However, Hinault rode the rest of the Tour with a stitched nose and two black eyes, caused by his sunglasses breaking when he fell. As a result of LeMond finishing ahead of him, Hinault's overall lead was cut down to 3:32 minutes.\nStage 15 was another transition stage. Hennie Kuiper (), winner of Milan–San Remo earlier in the year, did not take the start. Pedro Muñoz abandoned the race after . Jean-Claude Bagot () escaped on the third climb of the day, after . After he was recaptured, another attack went, containing Joël Pelier. Hinault, suffering from his injuries, was unhappy with the accelerations and brought the escape group back himself, not least due to the participation of Pelier. After , Eduardo Chozas () attacked on a downhill section and managed to get away from the field. By the time he crossed the summit of the Col d'Entremont after , his lead had increased to over ten minutes. With left to ride, the gap had increased to over 11 minutes, while Ludo Peeters () escaped from the main field. At the finish, Chozas took victory, 9:51 minutes ahead of Peeters, who just held off the group of favourites, led by Kelly. Hinault retained the race lead, while Chozas rose to seventh overall.\nAnother stage with minor categorised climbs followed the next day. Frédéric Vichot () broke clear of the field after , building a maximum lead of more than twenty minutes. As he approached the finish, his advantage decreased significantly, but he won the stage, 3:12 minutes ahead of Mottet and Bontempi, as Hinault remained the leader of the race overall.\nPyrenees.\nCongestion in his broken nose had led to bronchitis for Hinault, severely impacting his ability to perform. He was therefore weakened as the race entered the Pyrenees on stage 17. On the Col du Tourmalet, set a high tempo, putting Hinault into difficulty. Pedro Delgado later recalled that he saw Hinault yelling at Herrera, at which point he decided to attack. With Delgado went Roche and LeMond, as well as Parra. Early leader Pello Ruiz Cabestany () led over the top of the Tourmalet, 1:18 minutes ahead of Delgado, followed by LeMond, Roche, and Parra two minutes down. \nAs they approached the final ascent to Luz Ardiden, LeMond and Roche were in front. LeMond asked his team car about the gap to Hinault. Koechli told LeMond that Hinault was only 45 seconds behind him and that he was not allowed to work with Roche, in order not to endanger standing first and second on the general classification. He was told to hold station or attack and distance Roche. The latter heard the conversation between LeMond and his team car and remained alert, leading to both cancelling each other out and allowing other riders to catch back up. When LeMond saw that Hinault was not among them, he began to suspect that the gap he had been told was not correct. Delgado attacked from the main group and won the stage. LeMond eventually finished fifth, 2:52 minutes behind, and gained little over a minute on Hinault. At the finish, LeMond was visibly angry when interviewed by American television, saying that he felt betrayed by his team of a chance to win the Tour. In the general classification, Hinault remained in front, with LeMond 2:25 minutes behind. Views on the stage differ. LeMond describes how he was ready to quit the Tour that night, being severely disappointed by his team's refusal to let him work with Roche in order to win the Tour. Hinault meanwhile maintains that there were no bad feelings inside during the 1985 Tour and that it was a clear case of not attacking a teammate who has the race lead. Later the same day, team owner Tapie and Hinault convinced LeMond to continue riding by assuring him that the year after, Hinault would work for LeMond. LeMond emerged from the meeting with a different public statement, telling the press that he got carried away after the finish and that he would continue to work for Hinault.\nStage 18a, which was held in the morning, had a summit finish on the Col d'Aubisque. Roche attacked on the final ascent and won the stage, taking one-and-a-half minutes out of Hinault's lead. According to LeMond, Hinault was suffering so badly this time that LeMond had to push his teammate in order to conserve the race lead. Stage 18b in the afternoon was won by Roche's teammate Régis Simon, who beat Álvaro Pino () in a two-man sprint to the finish line. After the two split stages, Hinault's lead over LeMond stood at 2:13 minutes, with Roche in third, 3:30 minutes behind.\nFinal stages.\nWith only one time trial to come, victory appeared all but secure for Hinault. Speaking to journalist Samuel Abt of \"The New York Times\", five-time Tour winner Anquetil declared that he and Merckx would \"accept him in our club with pleasure\". Stage 19 to Bordeaux remained uneventful until about to the finish, when several riders tried, but failed, to escape. The race then settled for a bunch sprint, won by Vanderaerden ahead of Kelly by a very small margin. It was the first time during this Tour that the entire field, still 145 riders strong, reached the finish together. The following day, Johan Lammerts achieved the third stage victory for the team. He had broken away with four other riders with to go and went clear of them from the finish to win by 21 seconds ahead of Andersen. LeMond gained several seconds through bonuses at intermediate sprints, closing the gap to Hinault to 1:59 minutes.\nOn the penultimate day of the Tour, stage 21 saw the final time trial, around Lac de Vassivière near Limoges. LeMond did not incur any mechanical difficulties this time and won the stage, five seconds faster than Hinault. It was not only the first stage win for LeMond, but the first for a rider from the United States. After the stage, LeMond said: \"Now I know I can beat Hinault. I know I can win the Tour de France.\" Third place went to Anderson, who finished 31 seconds slower than LeMond, with Kelly in fourth, 54 seconds adrift, five seconds faster than Roche.\nThe final stage into Paris was, per tradition, a ceremonial affair, with no attacks to alter the general classification. In the final sprint, Rudy Matthijs took his third stage victory, with Sean Kelly finishing in second place for the fifth time during this Tour. Hinault finished safely in the field to win his fifth Tour de France, putting him equal with Anquetil and Merckx as record winner of the event, as well as securing his second Giro-Tour double, winning both races in the same year. During the final stage, Pedro Delgado used the small categorised climbs along the route to move past Robert Millar into second place in the mountains classification, ensuring his team the prize money that went with it.\nHinault's final victory margin over LeMond was 1:42 minutes. Roche rounded out the podium in third place, 4:29 minutes behind. His compatriot Kelly finished fourth overall, at 6:26 minutes, ahead of Anderson. Five teams finished the Tour with all ten riders still in the race: , , , , and .\nAftermath.\nHinault reiterated his promise to work for LeMond the following year several times during the final part of the 1985 Tour. Following the time trial on the penultimate day, he publicly stated in an interview with French cycling magazine \"Miroir du Cyclisme\": \"I'll stir things up to help Greg win, and I'll have fun doing it. That's a promise.\" On the victory podium in Paris, he leaned over to LeMond, telling him: \"Next year, it's you\", repeating the pledge again during the celebration dinner of that same evening. Public opinion saw Hinault and LeMond as good friends. The sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\" ran a cartoon on the day of the final stage, showing Hinault on a bicycle and LeMond next to him on a child's scooter, with Hinault saying \"Because you've been so good, I'll take you along next year on my handlebars\", to which LeMond replied: \"Thanks, Uncle Bernard.\" LeMond's first Tour victory the following year did not come as easily as these pledges and jokes indicated. Hinault attacked several times during the 1986 Tour de France, only conceding defeat after the last time trial. LeMond was frustrated with the apparent unwillingness by Hinault to honour the deal, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\" The rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was subject of the documentary \"Slaying the Badger\", part of ESPN's series \"30 for 30\". Based on the book by the same name by journalist Richard Moore, it premiered on 22 July 2014.\nIn previous years, cyclists tied their shoes to their pedals with toe-clips, allowing them to not only push the pedals down but also pull them up. In 1985, Hinault used clip-ins (clipless pedals), which allowed the shoes to snap into the pedal. His victory in this Tour made these clip-ins popular.\nThere was some criticism that the time trials were too important. If the time trials would have not counted towards the general classification, the result would have been as follows:\nThe total length of the time trials reduced from in 1985 to in 1986. Tour director Félix Lévitan felt after the 1985 Tour de France that the race had been too easy and made the course in 1986 extra difficult, including more mountain climbs than before.\nThis was the last year that the Tour de France was actively managed by Jacques Goddet, who had taken over as race director from the race's founder, Henri Desgrange, in 1936.\nDoping.\nAfter every stage, around four cyclists were selected for doping controls. None of these cyclists tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. After the end of the Tour, world champion Claude Criquielion, who had finished 18th overall, was involved in a doping controversy. At the national championship race before the Tour, he had tested positive for Pervitin, but received no repercussions. The head of the laboratory at Ghent University, which had administered the analysis, subsequently resigned his post in the Medical Commission of the Belgian Cycling Association (KBWB) in protest."

        "text": "The 1986 Tour de France was a cycling race held in France, from 4 July to 27 July. It was the 73rd running of the Tour de France. Greg LeMond of won the race, ahead of his teammate Bernard Hinault. It was the first ever victory for a rider outside of Europe. Five-time Tour winner Hinault, who had won the year before with LeMond supporting him, had publicly pledged to ride in support of LeMond in 1986. Several attacks during the race cast doubt on the sincerity of his promise, leading to a rift between the two riders and the entire La Vie Claire team. The 1986 Tour de France is widely considered to be one of the most memorable in the history of the sport due to the battle between LeMond and Hinault.\nThierry Marie () took the first race leader's yellow jersey after winning the prologue time trial. The lead then moved to Alex Stieda () after stage 1, only for Marie to recapture the lead after his team won the team time trial on stage 2. After short stints in the lead for Dominique Gaigne and Johan van der Velde, Jørgen V. Pedersen took the yellow jersey following a breakaway on stage 7 and retained the lead even after the first long time trial, won by Hinault. Stage 12 saw Hinault attack with Pedro Delgado (), who won the stage, while Hinault moved into the lead. Hinault attacked again the following day, but was caught and dropped. LeMond gained back significant time, but still trailed his teammate by 40 seconds.\nLeMond would move into the yellow jersey after stage 17, when Hinault fell behind on the climb of the Col d'Izoard. Stage 18 to Alpe d'Huez saw LeMond and Hinault finish hand-in-hand, with the latter winning the stage. LeMond's overall victory was sealed when Hinault was unable to overcome his deficit in the final time trial on stage 20. Urs Zimmermann () finished third, and was the only rider who posed a threat to the La Vie Claire team, who also had the 4th placed rider in Andy Hampsten.\nIn the race's other classifications, Hinault won the mountains classification, rider Eric Vanderaerden the points classification, and 's Andrew Hampsten won the young rider classification. finished at the head of the team classification by one hour 51 minutes, after placing four riders inside the final overall top-ten placings.\nOne of cycling's Grand Tours, the Tour consisted of 23 stages, beginning with a prologue in Boulogne-Billancourt and concluded on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The race was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation and was shown on television in 72 countries, with the total viewers estimated at one billion.\nTeams.\nIn June, 23 teams had requested to start in the 1986 Tour. The Tour organisers, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), accepted 21 applications, so a total of 21 teams participated in the 1986 Tour de France. The two teams whose application was denied were Skala-Skil and Miko. Each team sent a squad of ten riders, which meant that the race would start with a peloton of 210 cyclists, a record setting total. The ASO felt that 210 starters were too many and moved to reduce the size of the squads to eight riders each, but the teams protested, and the original number remained.\n became the Tour's first team from the United States, with a squad consisting of eight Americans, one Canadian and one Mexican. Jim Ochowicz, 's founder and manager, met with the ASO and persuaded them to invite his team. In the Spring, the team withdrew from competition in Europe (missing the opportunity to become the first American team in the history of the Vuelta a España) due to the United States conflict with Libya, losing out on much needed competitive racing unavailable in the United States. Joop Zoetemelk, the reigning road world champion, started and finished his 16th Tour de France, a record that stood until it was tied by Sylvain Chavanel in 2018.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nFive-time Tour winner and defending champion Bernard Hinault () had promised to support his teammate Greg LeMond, who had finished second in 1985, following controversy during that race when LeMond felt that a chance of potential victory had been taken from him due to team tactics. was therefore considered the squad to beat, with the team also featuring strong riders such as Andrew Hampsten, who had won the Tour de Suisse several weeks before the Tour de France. Before the start of the event, Hinault announced it would be the last Tour de France of his career. Prior to the start of the Tour, LeMond was confident of his chances, and pointed out that having Hinault, who he expected to take an early lead, would play to his advantage. Even with Hinault's assurances of support for LeMond, excitement over a possible record-breaking sixth Tour win was high in France. In a survey of 15 Dutch journalists, eight named Hinault as their main favourite for overall victory, just three chose LeMond. LeMond's season up to this point had been good, but had not yielded any major victories; he finished second at Milan–San Remo, third at Paris–Nice, fourth at the Giro d'Italia and third at the Tour de Suisse.\nLaurent Fignon (), winner in 1983 and 1984, was working on his comeback, having won the La Flèche Wallonne classic in the spring. He had missed the chance to defend his title the year earlier due to surgery on an inflamed Achilles tendon. Juan Mora of \"El País\" believed that the race would be highlighted by a duel between Fignon and Hinault. He named LeMond and Frenchman Charly Mottet as potential contenders if their team captains – Hinault and Fignon, respectively – failed to perform to the level expected. Mora believed Pedro Delgado to be the best Spanish contender for the overall title citing that his should perform well in the team time trial. Gian Paolo Ormezzano of \"La Stampa\" believed that there was no Italian rider competing that could be a legitimate threat to win the race, despite the fact that three Italian based teams were invited – the most since the 1979 edition. Ormezzano also thought the favourites going into the race were Hinault and Fignon. Fignon later recalled in his autobiography that he did not share the view of himself as a favourite, writing: \"I felt terrible physically. [...] My body — and perhaps my mind as well — was registering deep fatigue rather than an urge to get on with it.\" Stephen Roche (), third overall the year before, had injured his knee in a crash at the Paris Six-Day event in the winter, necessitating surgery in April, which meant that he arrived at the Tour out of form. Five-time Tour winner Jacques Anquetil named Luis Herrera () as his main favourite. Herrera himself declared: \"If I do not lose more than ten minutes before the mountains, I can win.\"\nSean Kelly () was considered the main favourite for victory in the points classification, having won the trophy a record-equalling third time the year before. However, a crash on the last stage of the Tour de Suisse prevented Kelly from starting. In his absence, Adri van der Poel () was given the best chances to win the classification.\nRoute and stages.\nThe race route for the 1986 edition of the Tour de France was unveiled on 8 October 1985 by both Jacques Goddet and Félix Lévitan. The race was pushed back a week from its normal date in order to prevent overlap with the 1986 FIFA World Cup, and therefore started on 4 July. Covering a total of , it included four time trials (three individual and one for teams) and ten stages deemed as flat. The race included four stages that featured a summit finish: stage 13 to Superbagnères; stage 17 to Col du Granon; stage 18 to Alpe d'Huez; and stage 21 to Puy de Dôme. The race took a counter-clockwise route around France. Following the prologue and opening stages in the Hauts-de-Seine region, the race moved north towards the Belgian border, before turning west to Brittany. The Tour then traveled south to Bordeaux, where a train transfer brought the riders to Bayonne, at the foot of the Pyrenees. From there, transition stages led the race to the Alps, before the final stages in the Massif Central and further north towards Paris.\nThe 1986 Tour de France had one rest day, after the finish on the Alpe d'Huez. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 18. The longest road-race stage was stage 11, at .\nTour director Levitan felt after the 1985 Tour de France that the race had been too easy, and made the course in 1986 extra difficult, including more mountain climbs than before. This angered Hinault, who threatened to skip the 1986 Tour. Before the race started, an avalanche deposited a large amount of dirt and rock on the slopes of the Col du Tourmalet, prompting Goddet to consider rerouting the course through the Col d'Aubisque.\nRace overview.\nOpening stages.\nThe prologue was won by Thierry Marie (), with Hinault in third place, just two seconds slower. Fignon and LeMond placed seventh and eighth, both four seconds back. On stage 1, Alex Stieda () attacked from the finish and collected time bonuses at the intermediate sprint, which would move him into the race lead. He was then joined in his breakaway by five other riders. The sextet held a small margin until the finish, with Pol Verschuere () taking the victory. Stieda, a Canadian, became the first rider from North America to wear the race leader's yellow jersey.\nThe same afternoon, the team time trial was held. The attempt at defending Stieda's race lead by his team proved unsuccessful. A crash by Eric Heiden slowed the team and forced several riders to take evasive action in order not to run into him, in the process scraping their tyres at the street curbing, which caused several punctures. In addition, Stieda was tired by his morning effort and fell back, getting in danger of missing the time limit. Chris Carmichael and Jeff Pierce had to fall back to lead him to the finish, which he reached in time but the yellow jersey was lost. It was regained by Marie, whose team won the time trial, while lost almost two minutes. Hinault personally instructed the team to wait for Niki Rüttimann and Guido Winterberg, who were nursing the after-effects of crashes during the morning stage, accounting for 's comparatively poor performance. lost significant time and four of the team's riders were eliminated because they missed the time limit.\n bounced back from their disappointment the following day, with Davis Phinney becoming the first American to win a road race stage. Phinney won the stage from a bunch sprint, even though he had been in the day's breakaway for most of the stage. Stage 4 went through Normandy, on rolling terrain. Régis Simon () broke away from the peloton and at from the finish, he held a lead of over ten minutes. He was eventually caught by a counterattack from Federico Echave (). On the finishing straight, Pello Ruiz Cabestany () overtook Echave to win the stage. Dutch champion Jos Lammertink () retired after suffering a broken skull in a crash, while Fabio Parra () also dropped out, courtesy of knee problems, leaving his team with only five of their original ten starters. Dominique Gaigne took over the yellow jersey from his teammate Marie, who he now led by six seconds.\nJohan van der Velde () won stage 5 and through time bonuses at both intermediate sprints and the stage finish, moved into the overall lead. He got the better of Joël Pelier () at the finish line. Both had been in a breakaway together, started after ridden. They finished 39 seconds ahead of van der Velde's teammate Eddy Planckaert, who in turn was followed by Miguel Induráin (), while the field, led by Alfonso Gutiérrez (), was 1:15 minutes behind. The stage saw a demonstration by workers in Lisieux, which did not impede the race. Van der Velde kept the race lead the following day. A five-man breakaway decided the outcome of the stage, won by Guido Bontempi of ahead of Roberto Pagnin ().\nThe yellow jersey changed hands again after stage 7. The stage began slowly, with the first breakaway established only after . The peloton was back together after , but another attack went shortly thereafter, including Ludo Peeters (), Jørgen V. Pedersen (), and Induráin. Other riders joined them later, but it was Peeters who eventually won the sprint from the group to win the stage, ahead of Ron Kiefel (). Pedersen took the race lead. On stage 8, after the peloton allowed Yvon Madiot () to drive ahead of the field to greet his family. Planckaert, not realising the situation, followed what he considered an attack in the company of Pelier, but all three were brought back. About later, another group broke away, containing Adri van der Poel (), Mathieu Hermans, () and Andrew Hampsten. Hampsten was considered a threat to the overall classification, which led the field to give chase. The peloton was united before their arrival in the finishing town, Nantes, where Silvano Contini () launched an unsuccessful breakaway attempt. Planckert, who only started the stage with the help of analgesic pills from his masseur due to back pain, won the sprint, beating out his teammate Eric Vanderaerden. Pedersen retained the overall lead.\nFirst long time trial and transition to the mountains.\nThe first real test for the general classification contenders came on stage 9, a individual time trial around Nantes. Hinault won the stage, 44 seconds ahead of LeMond, with Roche third, 1:01 minutes slower. Hinault benefited from a puncture by LeMond, which cost him time. Fignon finished in 32nd place, 3:42 minutes behind Hinault, a result he later described as \"unworthy of my status\". Pedersen did enough to retain the yellow jersey. Roche moved into second place, 1:05 minutes behind Pedersen, with Hinault a further five seconds behind in third. LeMond was eighth, 1:59 minutes behind the lead.\nStage 10 was won by Ángel Sarrapio (), who had been in a breakaway with Jean-Claude Bagot () during the stage. Pedersen kept the race lead, while Pelier used bonus seconds on the road to move ahead of Roche into second place in the general classification. On stage 11, a 12-man breakaway reached the finishing town of Bordeaux together. Rudy Dhaenens () escaped from the group from the finish. On the finishing straight, he was almost caught by the fast approaching Hermans and just held on to take the stage victory. Hermans would later say that the public announcer had aided Dhaenens' victory by warning him of Hermans over the PA system.\nPyrenees.\nFollowing a train transfer from Bordeaux to Bayonne at the foot of the Pyrenees in the morning, stage 12 led the riders over to Pau. The stage featured five mountain passes, with the first-category rated Col de Marie-Blanque at the end, before a descent into the finishing town. Several attacks occurred over the first part of the stage, each covered by riders of . At around from the finish, Hinault raised the pace on the ascent of the Col de Burdincurutcheta, forcing other contenders to chase back on, such as Herrera. Others, such as Roche, Fignon, and race leader Pedersen, dropped behind and would lose a lot of time by the end of the stage. Shortly before an intermediate sprint after , Hinault told his teammate Jean-François Bernard to accelerate, and the two, accompanied by Delgado, made the bridge to a lead group containing Eduardo Chozas (). These four riders then broke clear at the front, before Chozas lost contact about later. Bernard, the work for his team leader done, fell back another down the road. Delgado and Hinault worked well together to extend their advantage to the chasers, where LeMond, bound by team tactics, was unable to give chase himself. According to Delgado, Hinault clearly wanted to make time for the overall classification, and without any negotiating between the two, he gifted the stage win to Delgado. LeMond managed to break clear of the rest of the chase group with Herrera, but still arrived in Pau 4:37 minutes behind Hinault, who was now leading the race overall. After the stage, LeMond was overheard telling his father: \"Goddamnit, Dad, I am going to finish second again!\" Other favourites lost even more time: Robert Millar () finished 11th, 5:31 minutes behind. In 20th place was Fignon, arriving 11 minutes after Hinault. Roche lost 21 minutes, Phil Anderson () 33 minutes.\nStage 13 led the race through the Pyrenees again, over and four high mountain passes. The first was the Col du Tourmalet, coming after , followed by the Col d'Aspin, the Col de Peyresourde, and the final climb up to the ski resort of Superbagnères. Laurent Fignon had fallen ill with a fever and did not start the stage. Shortly after the start of the stage, Dominique Arnaud () attacked. When he began the ascent of the Tourmalet, he held a lead of 13 minutes over the field. A select group of favourites crossed the summit, led by Millar, now just over 7 minutes behind Arnaud. As they began the descent, Hinault attacked again, opening a gap to his opponents. As he reached the valley, his lead was at 43 seconds. Behind him, LeMond found himself again in a situation where he was unable to chase his teammate himself, while this time, the entire team was stunned by Hinault's attack, explicitly breaking the tactics the team had agreed upon in the morning, which was to sit back and have the other teams attack them. At the summit of the Aspin, Hinault's lead had increased to two minutes and he caught up with Arnaud on the subsequent descent. However, unlike the day before, the other favourites worked together to give chase, with Millar, Herrera, and Urs Zimmermann () committed to bringing Hinault back as the group reached the climb of the Peyresourde. They made contact with him on the descent and as the group began the final climb to Superbagnères, it became clear that Hinault had overexerted himself, falling back quickly. Hampsten, who had caught up with the LeMond group, attacked during the early part of the climb to soften up the opposition for LeMond. While Herrera suffering from cramp dropped back to his team car, LeMond counter-attacked, leaving Zimmermann and Millar behind and joined his teammate at the head of the race. With Hampsten falling behind soon after, LeMond continued to the finish alone and won the stage. Hinault trailed in eleventh, 4:39 minutes behind LeMond. He therefore maintained the lead of the race overall, but now just 40 seconds ahead of second-placed LeMond. Incidentally, LeMond had gained back the exact amount of time he had lost the previous day. At the team hotel later in the evening, owner Bernard Tapie had to intervene in an argument between his two leaders and Andrew Hampsten described the mood on the squad from then on as \"super tense\".\nTransition stages to the Alps.\nThe fourteenth stage led the race to Blagnac and was won by Niki Rüttimann (). The team had placed riders in every escape group of the day, and after about , Rüttimann managed to stay away with three other riders. They exchanged attacks in the final of the stage, with Rüttimann putting in the decisive move to win solo ahead of his pursuers, jumping into eighth place in the general classification. LeMond managed to gain six bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint, closing the gap on Hinault in the general classification to 34 seconds. Frank Hoste () won stage 15 in a two-man sprint against Silvano Contini (). The main field came in just eight seconds behind, but Luis Herrera lost 49 seconds after failing to bridge a gap in the peloton.\nThe final day before the Alps was stage 16, ending in the town of Gap. The peloton had to endure significant crosswinds during the stage, accompanied by several attacks from the field. After , Hinault was part of a group of four riders splitting away from the field in the winds, quickly making contact with another four-man break to form an escape of eight riders. While Hinault was joined by teammates Rüttimann and Winterberg, the group also contained Zimmermann, third overall. LeMond, crucially, had missed the move, but his three teammates in the breakaway still rode hard tempo, drawing out an advantage of 52 seconds. LeMond, again bound not to chase his own teammates, asked Robert Millar for help, who agreed to have his team do the chase work, while LeMond promised to gift Millar a stage should they finish close together. After , the groups were back together. Jean-François Bernard from won the stage after the two other riders in the final breakaway both punctured a tyre on the descent of the Col d'Espreaux. He moved up into thirteenth place in the general classification, which meant that now had five riders in the top thirteen places. Because of Hinault's breakaway tactics during the stage, Lemond threatened to resign from the race and had to be calmed by Tapie. According to Hampsten, the team was split into three groups: the French riders around Hinault, the two Swiss riders in between, and the other riders on LeMond's side. Jean-François Bernard supported this view, saying: \"The division was real. Even if it wasn't evident day-to-day, or on the surface, it was there the whole Tour. You could feel it.\" Hinault was unapologetic, saying: \"What's his [LeMond's] problem? Are his legs hurting? It might be just as well if he quits if he doesn't want to win the race any more.\"\nAlps.\nStage 17 finished on the Col du Granon, the highest mountain-top finish in Tour history up to that point, at an elevation of . Before the Col du Granon, the riders also had to ride across the Col de Vars and the Col d'Izoard. Eduardo Chozas () was in a solo breakaway and won the stage. Behind him, Hinault began to struggle on the climb of the Izoard, falling behind the others contenders. He suffered from pain in his left knee, a recurrence of an injury sustained in 1983. LeMond attacked as the group began the descent from the Col d'Izoard and was joined by Zimmermann. Zimmermann set a strong pace on the final climb to the Col du Granon and took second place on the stage, 6:26 minutes behind Chozas, with LeMond right behind him. Hinault came in thirteenth, losing 3:21 minutes to LeMond, who took over the race lead. LeMond led Zimmermann by 2:24 minutes, with Hinault a further 23 seconds behind. It was the first time that a rider from the USA wore the yellow jersey in the history of the Tour.\nThe night before stage 18 to Alpe d'Huez, Hinault called a team meeting, complaining about the fact that Zimmermann now split the two riders. He called for the team to attack Zimmermann the following day, \"until he was broken\". Another dispute broke out with LeMond, who pointed out that with a time trial still to come, a discipline that did not favour Zimmermann, there was no need for an all-out attack. Tapie had to talk to the riders until four o'clock in the morning to handle the situation. Shortly after the start of the stage in Briançon, the first climb of the day was the Col du Lautaret. A breakaway formed, including Herrera and Winterberg, who left their companions on the following climb, the Col du Galibier. Behind them, in the group of favourites, Zimmermann was closely guarding LeMond, while Hinault made several small accelerations to test the opposition. On the descent of the Galibier, Hinault attacked, only into the stage. He caught Herrera and Winterberg and they were joined by LeMond, Bauer and Ruiz Cabestany. As they reached the next small climb, the Col du Télégraphe, Hinault attacked again, going clear on his own. LeMond, having strict instructions from his team not to work with Zimmermann, was again stuck behind. LeMond dropped back to his team car for instructions by coach Paul Köchli, who urged him to attack Zimmermann instead of leading him towards Hinault, who at that point had a lead of about one-and-a-half minutes. LeMond attacked shortly before the summit and opened up a gap to Zimmermann on the descent, eventually catching up to Hinault, together with Bauer and Ruiz Cabestany. Bauer then did the lead work until the foot of the next climb, the Col de la Croix de Fer, where he dropped back. Ruiz Cabestany fell behind soon after. On the ascent, Hinault asked LeMond to ease the tempo, due to his aching knee, and set the pace himself. By the summit, they led Zimmermann by 2:50 minutes. On the descent, both set a high tempo, extending the lead over Zimmermann to 4:30 minutes as they reached the climb of Alpe d'Huez. Sensing that the French public, clearly favouring Hinault, made LeMond nervous, the former led all the way up the climb, with both riders steadily increasing their advantage over everybody else. Close to the finish line, LeMond drove alongside Hinault, putting his arm around him for a short conversation. At the finish, Hinault took LeMond's hand in an apparent gesture of comradery and they crossed the line together, with Hinault taking the stage win. Tapie later revealed that he had orchestrated the moment, having told LeMond before the climb to Alpe d'Huez that he had effectively won the race and that he should let Hinault take the stage. Zimmermann finished third, 5:15 behind the pair.\nThe illusion of a \"détente\" between the two leaders lasted only a few hours. In the evening, both appeared on French television in a joint interview with Jacques Chancel. Asked if the battle between them was over, Hinault answered that it would not be until the final time trial in Saint-Étienne. He reiterated the statement on the following day, the only rest day of the Tour. During a press conference, he declared: \"I'm very proud of what we did together, but let me say one more time: the Tour isn't over. Who was stronger on the climb? Go on, ask Greg.\" LeMond felt betrayed by Hinault's apparent unwillingness to honour the deal between the two riders. Hinault in turn promised that, should LeMond still lead the Tour after the final time trial, he would not attack again. This pledge came at the insistence of Tapie, after LeMond had once again threatened to leave the race should Hinault continue attacking. Pedro Delgado, winner of stage 12 and lying fifth overall, retired from the race during stage 18, having learned of the death of his mother. Robert Millar, having been fourth at the summit of the Galibier, lost over 19 minutes during the later part of the stage, dropping from fourth to eighth overall. In 2015, cycling journalist Peter Cossins called stage 18 \"the best remembered on the mountain [Alpe d'Huez]\", while describing it as \"a victory parade rather than a sporting contest.\"\nConclusion.\nAs the conclusion of the race drew closer, LeMond suspected that the public and a large part of the riders would prefer a record-breaking victory for Hinault. Before the start of stage 19, a journalist suggested to him that 80 per cent of the riders would support Hinault, to which he jokingly replied that he was surprised if twenty per cent supported him. Indeed, Hinault attacked once more during the stage, during the feed zone, a clear breach of cycling etiquette which dictates that no rider should attack while his competitors take on food and drinks. Bauer and Hampsten assisted LeMond in bringing Hinault back into the field. During an intermediate sprint, Hinault gained back two seconds to cut his disadvantage to 2:43 minutes. Julián Gorospe won the stage for , ahead of Anderson. Under growing suspicion that other riders would interfere with his race to favour Hinault, LeMond stated after the stage: \"If they want to crash me, I'd rather they tell me now. I'd rather give the race to them.\" Hinault's tactics were confusing to other riders as well. Speaking of the stage, Hampsten later recalled: \"It's the only time I ever chased a teammate in my life. It felt weird; I felt sick doing it. [...] I knew it was the right thing to do.\" Phil Anderson, riding for , was equally angry with Hinault, scolding him publicly after the stage for attacking his teammate in the yellow jersey. The night before the time trial, Tour director Jacques Goddet came to see LeMond at dinner and warned him to watch his water bottles and other equipment, saying: \"There are many who do not want you to win.\" LeMond heeded this advice, with his parents buying his own food. At the daily doping controls, he left his fingerprint in the sealing wax and photographed the urine bottles. According to LeMond, one rider even offered Hinault to cause a crash for LeMond, but Hinault refused.\nThe decisive stage of the race was the following day, a time trial around Saint-Étienne. After , LeMond was eight seconds faster than Hinault. However, with raced, LeMond crashed in a right-hand corner. While he was able to get up quickly and resume, his brake rubbed on the front wheel, making it necessary to change bikes. Hinault profited from LeMond's mishap to win the stage, but managed to only claw back 25 seconds to his teammate, who finished second. Both were in a class of their own, with Hinault catching up with Zimmermann at the finish line, even though the latter had started three minutes ahead of him. Following the stage, Hinault acknowledged his defeat, stating: \"After today, we won't fight any more.\" LeMond now led Hinault by 2:18 minutes.\nStage 21 was the last to feature significant climbing, finishing at the Puy de Dôme. Hinault, now no longer trying to dislodge LeMond, instead focused on securing his lead in the mountains classification, which he did by collecting maximum points at the top of the Croix de l'Homme, the first climb of the day. Erich Maechler () won the stage, having moved clear of a leading group at the start of the final ascent. Second was Ludo Peeters (), 34 seconds behind. LeMond came in 6:06 minutes behind, in eighteenth place. Hinault, having worked for his teammate during the stage, fell back on the final climb and lost 43 seconds to LeMond, who extended his overall advantage to 3:10 minutes. Robert Millar, fighting sickness, dropped out during this stage.\nGuido Bontempi won the final two stages of the race, first stage 22 into Nevers, edging out Hoste and Vanderaerden in a sprint finish. On the final, ceremonial stage into Paris, LeMond crashed and Hinault made a point to personally escort him back into the field. Hinault then contested the final sprint, won by Bontempi, and finished fourth to close out his Tour de France career. LeMond became the first rider from an English-speaking country to win the event, at an average speed of . Only 132 of the 210 starters finished the race in Paris. Robert Millar described the race as \"by far the hardest\" Tour he had ridden, adding: \"I don't think we ever climbed the mountains so fast.\" was the only team to arrive in Paris with all ten starters. The \"lanterne rouge\", the last-placed finisher of the race, was Ennio Salvador (), 2:55:51 hours behind LeMond.\nAftermath.\nPerception of the 1986 Tour de France and the rivalry between LeMond and Hinault remain divided. LeMond felt betrayed by Hinault's failure to live up to the clear assertion that he would assist him to win the Tour, saying: \"He made promises to me he never intended to keep. He made them just to relieve the pressure on himself.\" He showed disappointment when the public alleged that he had only won due to Hinault allowing it. Hinault's view of the 1986 Tour differs from LeMond's. In his autobiography, he wrote:\nAfter the final time trial, Hinault claimed to have attacked repeatedly to toughen LeMond up, adding: \"Next year maybe he'll have to fight off another opponent who will make life miserable for him. Now he'll know how to fight back.\" Cycling historians Bill and Carol McGann refuse this argument, writing: \"Of course, Hinault reneged on his promise. His words, that he was trying to toughen LeMond or get him to earn his Tour, are obvious nonsense.\"\nIn France, Hinault's aggressive riding style was widely celebrated and did much to improve his public image, which had suffered due to an alleged lack of panache during his Tour wins and his behaviour towards fans and officials. Robert Millar suggested that he specifically rode the way he did in 1986 to win over the French public. Friction between LeMond and Hinault continued into the Coors Classic later in the year, the last stage race of Hinault's career. When LeMond attacked during a stage to move up from third to second place overall, Hinault accused him of riding against him, who was in the lead. LeMond countered, assuring him of his assistance and adding: \"That's a promise, which is something that you can't keep.\"\nHinault, as he had announced previously, retired at the end of the season, on his 32nd birthday. LeMond meanwhile was unable to defend his Tour title, suffering a near-fatal hunting accident on Easter 1987. He returned to the Tour in 1989, winning the event for a second time and adding a third victory in 1990.\nThe rivalry between Hinault and LeMond in both the 1985 and 1986 Tours was the subject of the documentary \"Slaying the Badger\", part of ESPN's series \"30 for 30\". Based on the book by the same name by journalist Richard Moore, it premiered on 22 July 2014.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1986 Tour de France, six of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. No time bonuses were given at stage finishes, a change from the 1985 edition. Time bonuses were given for the intermediate sprints. Over the first half of the race, each intermediate sprint gave 12, 8, and 4 bonus seconds to the first three riders across the line, while during the second half, 6, 4, and 2 seconds were awarded. There were 94 intermediate sprints over the course of the 1986 Tour, a record number. In the team time trial on stage 2, the real time of the finishing teams was used to calculate the overall classification, taken on the sixth rider of each team to cross the finish line. The time that could be lost was limited at five minutes, however, if a rider did not finish with the rest of his team, his real time was used, even if it exceeded five minutes.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, where cyclists were given points for finishing in the top 25 on a stage. All stages awarded the same number of points: 25 for the winner, with each subsequent place receiving one fewer point. In this edition, no points were awarded at intermediate sprints. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey. Eric Vanderaerden was the winner of this classification.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The Tour organisers categorised some climbs as either \"hors catégorie\", first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Climbs rated \"hors catégorie\" gave 40 points to the first rider across, down to one point for the 15th rider to reach the summit. First-category climbs awarded 30 points, second category ones 20 for the first rider. Third- and fourth-category mountains awarded 7 and 4 points respectively to the first man across. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots. Bernard Hinault won the mountains prize.\nThere was also a combination classification. This classification was calculated as a combination of the other classifications; its leader wore the combination jersey. Being in first place in the general, points, mountains, or intermediate sprints classification awarded 25 points, down to one point for 25th place. For the second consecutive year, Greg LeMond was the winner of this classification.\nAnother classification was the debutant classification. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders that rode the Tour for the first time were eligible, and the leader wore a white jersey. 79 out of the 210 starters were eligible. Andrew Hampsten was the first-placed rider in this classification.\nThe sixth individual classification was the intermediate sprints classification. This classification had similar rules as the points classification, but points were only awarded on intermediate sprints. Its leader wore a red jersey. Gerrit Solleveld () won this classification.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification were identified by yellow caps. There was also a team points classification. Cyclists received points according to their finishing position on each stage, with the first rider receiving one point. The first three finishers of each team had their points combined, and the team with the fewest points led the classification. The riders of the team leading this classification wore green caps. won the team classification, while won the team points classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each mass-start stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. At the conclusion of the Tour, Bernard Hinault won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 18. This prize was won by Luis Herrera. Other minor prizes given included one for the best teammate, won by Bruno Leali (). An award for the \"most amiable\" rider was given to Ruiz Cabestany. Zoetemelk received a prize for fairplay. There was also a fairplay award given after every stage, and the winners were allowed to wear special socks during the next stage, showing the logo of Paris' eventually unsuccessful bid to host the 1992 Summer Olympics.\nBetween 1977 and 1985, a system of \"flying stages\" had been used. This included a finish line at the middle part of the stage, with the first rider across awarded the same bonuses and prizes as regular stage winners. However, due to a lack of public acceptance for the concept, it was scrapped for the 1986 edition.\nSuper Prestige Pernod ranking.\nRiders in the Tour competed individually for points that contributed towards the Super Prestige Pernod ranking, an international season-long road cycling competition, with the winner seen as the best all-round rider. The 250 points accrued by Greg LeMond moved him from fourth to the top of the ranking, replacing Sean Kelly, who did not ride the Tour.\nDoping.\nNo rider tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs during the 1986 Tour. Had a positive test occurred, the penalty would have been a ten-minute time penalty for the general classification and a demotion to last place on the stage. In his book \"Rough Ride\", rider Paul Kimmage () revealed that during the final stage into Paris, he witnessed riders injecting substances with needles, telling him that they were not afraid to get caught, since only the stage winner and top finishers were tested. In a television interview in late 1999, Peter Winnen () revealed that he had used testosterone to help him get through the Tour in 1986."

After three seasons the Second Division was abolished and not resurrected until 1962. Two seasons later in 1964 the Second Division was scrapped for the second time.\nThe division was resurrected again in 1973 and has been played every season since. During the 1991–92 season, a third division was established and, for the first time, two teams were relegated. There was no regular relegation from the Second Division until 2003.\nIn 1995, in anticipation for the Super League starting in 1996, six teams were relegated from the RFL Championship, five were relegated to the Second Division and one was relegated to form the Third Division. Controversy was caused as London Broncos, who finished 4th in the Second Division, were elected to the Championship ahead of Keighley, Batley and Huddersfield.\nIn 2003, the divisions under Super League were reorganised into the National Leagues with Second and Third Divisions becoming National League One and National League Two."

There was no question the UK would again be absent at their home Olympics, although there were some organizational difficulties. First of all, the four British nations were independently affiliated with the international federation FIH and were not very keen on cooperating. Also, there were no hockey grounds to train on, as these were used by cricketers during the summer. Still, they managed to put together a team, the first real British hockey team at the Olympics (the 1908 and 1920 champions had been composed entirely of English players). Their captain was the versatile Norman Borrett, a first-class cricketer and national squash champion who once qualified for Wimbledon but didn't have time to compete.\nThe fixtures were announced on 19 June 1948. Revised fixtures were announced on 28 July. Britain and India were seeded, along with Pakistan and the Netherlands. Pakistan had only separated from India the previous year and made their first Olympic appearance in London. One of the team members, Ali Iqtidar Shah Dara, had been on the golden Indian team of 1936. All four ranked teams made the semis, although the Brits were held to a goalless draw by Switzerland, and Pakistan crushed the Dutch 6–1 in their group match. The semi-finals were close, and British observers considered the Indians to be lucky to get away with a 2–1 win against the Dutch. With Britain beating Pakistan, the gold medal match would finally see India play the Britons. Completely focused on its defense, Britain was unable to keep up with the fast-paced Indians, and they lost it 4–0.

If a player or an official accepts from club, association, or federation an amount exceeding what is strictly necessary for traveling and hotel expenses, such an amount will be regarded as profit.\nOnly a men's competition occurred that year, and nine nations competed: Czechoslovakia withdrew before the draw.\nResults.\nDivisions.\nDivision A.\n&lt;section begin=A /&gt;&lt;section end=A /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A1 /&gt;&lt;section end=A1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A2 /&gt;&lt;section end=A2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A3 /&gt;&lt;section end=A3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A4 /&gt;&lt;section end=A4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A5 /&gt;&lt;section end=A5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A6 /&gt;&lt;section end=A6 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A7 /&gt;&lt;section end=A7 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A8 /&gt;&lt;section end=A8 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A9 /&gt;&lt;section end=A9 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=A10 /&gt;&lt;section end=A10 /&gt;\nDivision B.\n&lt;section begin=B /&gt;&lt;section end=B /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B1 /&gt;&lt;section end=B1 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B2 /&gt;&lt;section end=B2 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B3 /&gt;&lt;section end=B3 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B4 /&gt;&lt;section end=B4 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B5 /&gt;&lt;section end=B5 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=B6 /&gt;&lt;section end=B6 /&gt;\nMedal round.\nBronze medal match.\n&lt;section begin=E1 /&gt;&lt;section end=E1 /&gt;\nGold medal match.\n&lt;section begin=E2 /&gt;&lt;section end=E2 /&gt;\nMedal summary.\nNote: The players above the line played at least one game in this tournament, the players below the line were probably only squad members.

        "title": "Tow-in surfing",
        "text": "Tow-in surfing is a surfing technique which uses artificial assistance to allow the surfer to catch faster-moving waves than was traditionally possible when paddling by hand. Tow-in surfing was invented by surfers who wanted to catch big waves and break the barrier. It has been one of the biggest breakthroughs in surfing history.\nHistory.\nTow-in surfing was pioneered by Laird Hamilton, Buzzy Kerbox, Dave Kalama, and others in the mid 1990s. A surfer is towed into a breaking wave by a partner driving a personal watercraft (PWC, commonly known by the brand name Jet Ski) or a helicopter with an attached tow-line. This method has a demonstrated advantage in situations where the wave is too large (such as Peahi off the north side of Maui), or where position on the wave is extremely critical (Teahupoo off southeast Tahiti).\nThe use of a helicopter for tow-in surfing started to appear in the mid 2000s, and has several advantages over the use of a personal watercraft. The pilot, positioned high above the surfer, is able to spot large waves from farther away and position the surfer accordingly. A helicopter can go faster, and is not affected by the ocean surface like a watercraft, but is much more expensive to operate.\nBefore tow-in surfing was created, surfers were not capable of catching waves that were between tall on their surfboards made for larger waves called \"guns\". The biggest wave one could catch before tow-in surfing was in the range. Tow-in surfing is accomplished by taking a personal watercraft (PWC) and a tow-rope and combining that with a surfer. One person pulls the surfer out to the break on the PWC. When the waves comes, the person on the PWC tows the surfer via the tow-rope into the wave. Once the surfer is in the wave, the rope is dropped. The surfer is then on their own to surf some of the biggest waves in the world.\nDifferences.\nTow-in surfing differs from regular surfing in several different ways. First, the waves are much larger; a surfer has to be towed in to the wave, and there is the risk of a wall of water the size of a three-story building falling down on them. Laird Hamilton said “The sensation is a combination of flying, sailing and just going as fast as you've ever been. Really, it’s just the sensation of speed.”\nControversy.\nCritics of tow-in surfing decry the noise and exhaust fumes made by PWC engines, as well as the likelihood that new participants can get into predicaments that they have not been trained or conditioned to survive. On the other hand, a skilled team of driver and surfer, who often swap roles in the water during a session, develop a rapport and an understanding of ocean conditions that allows them to proactively watch out for each other.\nEnvironmentalists and surfing purists have passed a proposal to shut down tow-in surfing at Mavericks in Northern California, saying that is hazardous to local wildlife and a nuisance to residents."

        "title": "Batting (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, batting is the act of facing the opposing pitcher and trying to produce offense for one's team. A batter or hitter is a person whose turn it is to face the pitcher. The three main goals of batters are to become a baserunner, to drive runners home or to advance runners along the bases for others to drive home, but the techniques and strategies they use to do so vary. Hitting uses a motion that is virtually unique to baseball and its fellow bat-and-ball sports, one that is rarely used in other sports. Hitting is unique because it involves rotating in the horizontal plane of movement, unlike most sports movements which occur in the vertical plane.\nGoals.\nIn general, batters try to get hits. However, their primary objective is to avoid making an out, and helping their team to score runs. There are several ways they can help their team score runs. They may draw a walk if they receive and do not swing the bat at four pitches located outside the strike zone. In cases when there is a runner on third and fewer than two outs, they can attempt to hit a sacrifice fly to drive the runner in by allowing the runner on third to tag up and score. When there are fewer than two outs and runners on base, they can try to sacrifice bunt to advance the runner(s) or, with a runner on first or with runners on first and third, they can try a hit and run play, also designed to advance the runner(s). They might even be hit by a pitch, reach on an error or—if first is empty or there are two outs—on a dropped third strike.\nThe defense attempts to get the batter out. The pitcher's main role in this is to throw the ball in such a way that the batter either strikes out or cannot hit it cleanly so that the defense can get him or her out.\nSuccess in batting.\nBatting is often cited as one of the most difficult feats in sports because it consists of hitting a small round ball, usually moving at high velocity, with a thin round bat. Batters getting a hit in three out of ten at bats, giving him a batting average of .300 (pronounced \"three hundred\") are considered a successful hitter. In Major League Baseball, no batter has had over a .400 average at the end of the season since Ted Williams' .406 in 1941, and no batter has ever hit over .367 in a lifetime—Ty Cobb hit .3664. In modern times, the statistic on-base plus slugging (OPS) is seen as a more accurate measure of a player's ability as a batter; this stat combines the player's on-base percentage (a percentage of their plate appearances where the batter gets on base), with the player's slugging percentage (an average of total bases with at-bats). An OPS at or near 1.000 is considered to be the mark of an exceptional hitter. A sustained OPS at or above 1.000 over a career is a feat only a few hitters have ever been able to reach.\nStrategy.\nBatters vary in their approach at the plate. Some are aggressive hitters, often swinging at the first pitch (as pitchers often attempt to throw a first-pitch strike).\nOthers are patient, attempting to work the pitch count in order to observe all the types of pitches a pitcher will use, as well as tire out the pitcher by forcing him to throw many pitches early. Generally, contact hitters are more aggressive, swinging at pitches within the strike zone, whereas power hitters will lay off borderline strikes in order to get a pitch they can drive for extra bases.\nWarming up.\nIn preparation of hitting, every baseball player has their own particular warm-up routine. Warming up before the game is usually done as a team, at the amateur level, and focuses on helping the hitter get in the correct mindset to hit the ball. The most notable drill used is the \"Tee Drill\", where you hit a ball off a baseball tee and correct any issues you found during previous games or practices. There are also various hitting devices used during warm up in the \"on deck circle\" to try and increase the batter's bat velocity. The over weighted supplemental devices include swinging multiple bats, standard 23 oz softball bat, heavier 26 oz softball bat, lighter 18 oz softball bat and Doughnut ring (16 oz). Weighted warm-up devices are commonly used because players feel that warming-up with heavier bats will help them increase bat velocity because after the warm-up with a heavier bat, the normal bat feels lighter and they feel they could swing it faster. The effect of these devices is not only mental, but it may also be physical. Heavy warm up loads stimulate the neural system, allowing for increased muscle activation during lighter bat swings. The use of weighted bats is based on the theory of complex training where sets of heavier and lighter resistances are alternated to increase muscle performance. This theory revolves around the idea that muscle contractions are stronger after reaching near maximal contractions. The postactivation potentiation improves motor neuron pool excitability and increases the number of recruited motor units, both leading to greater power output. The additional weight may also help strengthen the muscles of the forearms and wrist thus increasing bat velocity, though some evidence suggests that the effect is psychological rather than biomechanical.\nThe lineup.\nThe lineup or batting order is a list of the nine baseball players for a team in the order they will bat during the game. During the game the only way to change the lineup is via substitution, as batting out of turn is not allowed. Once the ninth person in the lineup finishes batting, the first person bats again; this is the \"top of the order\". Lineups are designed to facilitate manufacturing runs. Depending on batters' skills, they might be placed in different parts of the lineup. Of course, when it comes down to it, all batters are attempting to create runs for the team.\nThe player currently batting in a game is said to be \"at the plate\", \"at bat\", or \"up to bat\" (shortened to \"up\"). To keep the game moving at an orderly pace, the next batter due up waits to take his turn in a circle (actually marked or imaginary) between his team's \"dugout\" or bench and the batter's box, and is said to be \"on deck\", with the circle known as the \"on deck circle\". The player in the batting order after the on deck batter is said to be \"in the hole\".\nHistory of the bat.\nWhen baseball was in its beginning years, baseball players made their own bats. This allowed players to experiment with different shapes and sizes of the bats. It did not take long for players to realize that the best bats were those with rounded barrels. Wood bats are rare at most levels other than the pros. The majority of wood baseball bats today are made from northern white ash harvested from Pennsylvania or New York. White ash is used because of its hardness, durability, strength, weight and feel. Trees that provide the lumber for baseball bats are often 50 years old, and of all the lumber harvested, the top 10 percent is saved for pro bats. Recent technology in drying wood has created bats with lower moisture content, which are light enough to make effective baseball bats. Rock or Sugar Maple bats are preferred. Maple bats cost more than white ash, but they often last longer as a result of their high strength.\nTypes of bats.\nIn addition to the Louisville Slugger, there are many other types of bats that have been used throughout the history of baseball.\nThe introduction of aluminum baseball bats in the 1970s forever changed the game of baseball at every level but the professional. Aluminum bats are lighter and stronger than wooden bats. Because of the trampoline effect that occurs when a baseball hit an aluminum bat, aluminum bats can hit a ball significantly farther than wooden bats can.\nIn light of the increase in power of composite and alloy bats, the NCAA and NFHS have adopted more stringent standards against the use of composite and alloy bats. The NCAA changed standards at the start of the 2011 season, and the NFHS plans to complete the change in the 2012 baseball season.\nBat design.\nThe design of bats also continues to evolve as manufacturers search for ways to magnify the trampoline effect and increase the size of the bat's “sweet spot.” In aluminum bats, a double-walled bat was introduced in the late 1990s. This design comprises an outer wall of scandium-aluminum, an inner wall of a composite material, and a “filling of rubber or a thick fluid between the two walls."

        "title": "1987 World Series",
        "text": "The 1987 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 1987 season. The 84th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Minnesota Twins and the National League (NL) champion St. Louis Cardinals. The Twins defeated the Cardinals four games to three to win the Series, their first in Minnesota and the first since last winning as the Washington Senators in 1924. Twins pitcher Frank Viola was named as the 1987 World Series MVP.\nIt was the first World Series to feature games played indoors, and the first in which the home team won every game; this would happen again in (also a Twins championship, over the Atlanta Braves) and in with the Arizona Diamondbacks defeating the New York Yankees. \nThis was the third of six World Series played entirely on artificial turf, with the others in , , , , and .\nThis is the first World Series in which the series logo appeared on the jerseys; only the Cardinals wore it. Both contestants in the following year's World Series wore a patch. It was also the last World Series in which any games were played during the day as opposed to in the evening.\nSummary.\nThe 1987 World Series was the first World Series games played in an indoor stadium (the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome) and, to date, the last World Series game to start earlier than prime time in the eastern United States (Game 6 started at 4:00 p.m. ET/3:00 p.m. CT), and it was the first World Series in which all games were won by the home team. (Four previous series had the home team winning the first six games, including the 1965 World Series, when the Twins dropped Game 7 to the Dodgers.) The bottom half of the ninth inning was never played in any game of this Series, the first and only time this has happened. In 1987, the Twins set the record for the worst (full 162 game) regular season win–loss record of any World Series championship team (85–77, .525). This record stood until it was broken when the Cardinals won the 2006 Series after going 83–78 (.516).\nBesides setting a record for the worst regular season winning percentage for a World Series winner and hosting the first World Series game indoors, the Twins were the first team to enter the World Series having been outscored in the regular season. The Twins, as a team, were outnumbered in virtually every major statistical category in 1987. As ABC play-by-play commentator Al Michaels put it in the pre-game show for Game 1, \"They were out everything!\"\nThe Cardinals posted a 95–67 record during the regular season, but were hindered by injuries in the postseason, most notably with the loss of their lone home-run threat, first baseman Jack Clark, who sprained his right ankle in a game in Montreal on September 9. During the regular season, Clark led the National League in on-base percentage and slugging percentage despite playing in Busch Memorial Stadium, which was reputed to be the league's most extreme \"pitcher's park.\" He hit 35 home runs in 131 games, and was the only person on the team to hit more than 12. The player on the team who hit 12, starting third baseman Terry Pendleton (though named to the World Series roster) was hampered with a ribcage injury. Normally a switch-hitter, Pendleton was only able to swing lefthanded during the World Series and was also unable to play the field and thus was relegated to pinch-hitting duties or being the designated hitter in the games in Minnesota started by right-handed starters.\nGame 7 was won by Minnesota on the 35th birthday of the Twins' Roy Smalley – and was also the last game of his career. Smalley appeared in four games as a pinch-hitter and reached base all four times on a double, an error, and two walks.\nMatchups.\nGame 1.\nA raucous, sold-out Metrodome met the Cardinals on October 17, stunning the visitors with crowd noise that could exceed 110 decibels SPL. The Cardinals struggled defensively, with outfielder Willie McGee losing sight of pop flies against the Metrodome's white roof in the fourth and eighth innings, and infielder Tom Lawless committing an infield error in the sixth inning. None of those miscues, however, contributed to Twins runs. The Twins' aggressive play further compounded the problems of the Cards, and the game ended as a 10–1 blowout. Starting pitcher Frankie \"Sweet Music\" Viola had little trouble with the Cardinals' potent lineup. For the Twins, Dan Gladden hit a grand slam and totaled five RBIs, capping off a seven-run fourth inning, with Steve Lombardozzi adding a two-run homer, while Kent Hrbek had two RBIs.\nFrank Viola was scheduled to be best man at his brother's wedding, but had to cancel when the Twins reached the World Series as it fell on the same night as Game 1, in which he was scheduled as starter. ABC showed clips of the wedding throughout the game's broadcast.\nCoincidentally, the song \"U Got The Look\" peaked in popularity (#2 on the \"Billboard\" singles chart) on this date. The song was written and performed by Prince (a Minneapolis native) and contains the line \"boy versus girl in the World Series of love\".\nGame 2.\nWhile improving on their Game One performance, the Cards were again unable to hold the Twins offense and fell behind 7–0 before beginning to rally. The Cards' total of nine hits was just one short of the Twins but they managed only one double, against three doubles and two home runs hit by Minnesota. Gary Gaetti hit a homer in the second inning. The Twins broke the game open in the fourth, scoring six runs resulting in starter Danny Cox being pulled from the game. The final score was 8–4. Randy Bush and Tim Laudner each came through with a pair of two-run-scoring hits in the fourth, with Laudner's being a home run and Bush's being a double. Bert Blyleven pitched seven innings of two-run baseball for the win.\nGame 3.\nTraveling down the Mississippi, to the open air of Busch Stadium, Game 3 saw a tense pitching duel between Twins starter Les Straker and John Tudor of the Cardinals. This match-up was also notable for Straker being the first Venezuelan to pitch in a World Series game.\nAfter five scoreless innings by both teams, the Twins broke through in the top of the sixth inning. Greg Gagne walked to lead off the inning, and Kirby Puckett walked to move Gagne into scoring position. Tom Brunansky's RBI single looked like all the offense the game would see. But, in the bottom of the seventh, Juan Berenguer, in relief of Straker, surrendered leadoff back-to-back singles to Jose Oquendo and Tony Peña. Terry Pendleton sacrificed the runners to second and third, and Vince Coleman slammed a two-run double to give the Cards a 2–1 lead. Ozzie Smith followed by singling in Coleman for the final run, and Todd Worrell closed out saving the win for Tudor.\nGame 4.\nIn Game 4, the Twins scored first on Greg Gagne’s home run, but the Cardinals tied it on a Jim Lindeman RBI single. Tom Lawless hit a three-run homer in the fourth off Viola (only his second Major League homer after going 2 for 25 during the regular season), one of Viola's five earned runs in the game and six runs in the fourth. The Cards, however, weren't done scoring; Dan Schatzeder allowed another RBI single to Lindeman and a two-run double to Willie McGee. Joe Niekro and George Frazier shut the Redbirds out the rest of the game. Bob Forsch got the win with innings of one run relief. Starter Greg Mathews aggravated a quadriceps injury in the fourth inning (the injury went back to Game 5 of the NLCS), had to be removed from the game and was unable to play for the rest of the series. Ken Dayley got the save.\nJust prior to Game 4, Reggie Jackson, who was working as a field reporter for ABC's coverage of the 1987 World Series, admitted that he didn't know who Tom Lawless was.\nGame 5.\nGame 5 was a much closer contest, with the Cardinals coming out victorious by a score of 4–2. Curt Ford hit a two-run single in the sixth, breaking a scoreless pitcher's duel between Danny Cox and Bert Blyleven. By the end of the seventh, the Cards were up 4–0. The Twins scored two in the eighth on a triple by Gary Gaetti off reliever Todd Worrell to make a game of it, but eventually relinquished the save to him as Gaetti failed to score. The Cardinals stole five bases in Game 5, the most for any team since the 1907 Chicago Cubs.\nGame 6.\nThe Series returned to the Metrodome with the Twins facing elimination (a position they would find themselves in four years later against the Atlanta Braves). ABC allowed the game to be played at 3 p.m. CT (4 p.m. ET) on Saturday afternoon – the only day game of the series, and the last World Series game to date to be played in the daytime (although as the game was played in the Metrodome, the game took place under artificial lighting).\nThe Cardinals drew first blood off Les Straker on a Tommy Herr home run in the first, and the Twins countered with two in their half of the first on RBI singles by Kirby Puckett and Don Baylor. The Cardinals soon tied it in the second on a Jose Oquendo RBI single.\nIn the fourth, the Cards chased Straker when Dan Driessen led off with a double to right and went to third on a Willie McGee single. McGee took second on the attempted throw home by center fielder Kirby Puckett. Terry Pendleton followed by singling home Driessen and Oquendo hit a sacrifice fly to make it 4–2. Another run scored for the Cards in the fifth when lefty Dan Schatzeder walked Ozzie Smith. Smith went to second on a groundout, to third on a flyout, and scored on another McGee single.\nIn the bottom of the fifth, however, the Twins began to claw their way back against John Tudor. Puckett led off with a single and was doubled in by Gary Gaetti. Benefitting from use of the designated hitter in their home ballpark, the Twins then tied it on a mammoth home run by their DH, Don Baylor. After Tom Brunansky followed with a single, the Twins took the lead for good when Steve Lombardozzi singled him in with two out on a close play at the plate.\nThe Twins then blew the game open in the sixth. Greg Gagne led off with an infield single and Puckett walked. A passed ball by Tony Peña advanced the runners. With first base open and one out, Cards veteran Bob Forsch intentionally walked Baylor to load the bases. Baylor had played only 20 regular season games with the Twins after being traded from Boston and Tim McCarver in the ABC broadcast booth argued that he should be pitched to rather than walked, despite the home run in the previous inning. Both Jim Palmer and Al Michaels agreed, as Palmer didn't like the idea of loading the bases with the risk of giving up multiple runs, and Michaels pointed out that left-hander Ken Dayley might have to be brought in earlier than normal. After Brunansky popped out, Dayley was indeed brought in to face the lefty-hitting Kent Hrbek. Hrbek finally broke out of his slump and hit a grand slam to the deepest part of center field.\nBrunansky drove in the final run in the eighth and the Twins had staved off defeat. This was the last day game in World Series history to date.\nGame 7.\nGame 7 forced a National Football League game between the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings, originally scheduled for that afternoon at the Metrodome, to be played the following night (also on ABC).\nJoe Magrane of the St. Louis Cardinals became only the sixth rookie pitcher to start the seventh game of a World Series. He also is the only pitcher in World Series history to start Games 1 and 7 of a World Series without any starts in between, as the Cardinals' Game 4 starter, Greg Mathews, had had to be removed early due to an injury and was unavailable for the remainder of the Series. Magrane had actually started the 1987 season pitching for the Cardinals Triple-A team, the Louisville Redbirds.\nIn the second, the Cardinals looked poised to send Frank Viola to an early shower. Three straight no-out singles by Jim Lindeman, Willie McGee, and Tony Peña plated the first run. Viola settled down to retire the next two hitters, but then Steve Lake singled in McGee for a 2–0 lead. Viola settled into a groove, however, and allowed only two more hits and no runs in eight strong innings.\nThe Twins came back in their half of the second on a Steve Lombardozzi RBI single, but not before a missed call at home plate by umpire Dave Phillips had already cost the Twins a run. Twins DH Don Baylor reached base on a hit-by-pitch by Magrane to lead off the inning and Tom Brunansky singled him to second. With one out, Tim Laudner singled to left and Baylor was called out at home on a throw from Vince Coleman in left, while replays clearly showed Baylor was safe. Lombardozzi then singled in Brunansky.\nIn the fifth, the Twins tied the score when Greg Gagne reached on an infield hit and Kirby Puckett drove him in with a double. Incidentally, replays showed Gagne to be out on his infield hit, thus this run served to counteract the run the Twins lost in the second on the missed call on Baylor at the plate. The Twins seemed on the verge of taking the lead when Gary Gaetti followed Puckett with a walk and went to second when Puckett was thrown out by Lake trying to advance to third on a wild pitch that was deflected when it hit the home plate umpire in the face-mask. Baylor followed with a single to left, but Coleman threw out Gaetti at the plate in a violent collision with Lake. Coleman became the first outfielder to throw two runners out at the plate in one World Series game.\nThe sixth inning proved to be controversial. In the top of the sixth, Tom Herr had hit a single with one out. With Jim Lindeman at bat, the third missed call of the game would occur. On a 3-2 count, Herr would get caught in a rundown and Lombardozzi ran him back to first where Kent Hrbek was standing off the bag near the basepath. Lombardozzi tossed the ball towards Hrbek and the ball sailed past him but into the glove of Viola behind the bag. Viola had come over to take part in the rundown. Herr was hindered by Hrbek returning to the bag, but clearly reached the bag safely before Viola tagged him. However, first base umpire Lee Weyer called Herr out. Weyer's view was blocked by Kent Hrbek and, according to the broadcast crew, Viola made the tag late and Hrbek should have been called for interference. Had this been called, Herr would have been safe, awarded second base, and the Cardinals would have had a runner at second with one out. It was the third missed call of the game for the normally highly regarded Weyer—often considered one of the best umpires in baseball—-and the fourth of the game total with Phillips’ missed call on Baylor in the 2nd. Two of the four missed calls had direct effects on the score, but they cancelled each other out, as one cost the Twins a run while another led to their scoring a gift run in the 5th. The Herr call did not directly affect the score because on the next pitch, Lindeman flied out to right field to end the 6th inning and Viola also retired the first batter of the following inning. The Twins then took the lead in the bottom of the inning, off Danny Cox, who had relieved Magrane the previous inning. Cox walked Brunansky and Hrbek to lead off, and was replaced by Todd Worrell. As Cox was leaving, he got into an argument with home plate umpire Dave Phillips and was ejected as he was leaving the field. As of 2020, Cox is the last non-manager to be ejected from a World Series game. After retiring the first batter he faced, Worrell walked pinch-hitter Roy Smalley and struck out Dan Gladden for the second out. The next batter, Gagne, reached first on an infield hit as Brunansky scored the go-ahead run.\nThe Twins' final run came in the eighth on an RBI double by Dan Gladden off Worrell, who stayed in the rest of the game for the Cardinals. Jeff Reardon retired the side in the ninth to give Minnesota their first World Series victory.\nWith the victory, Tom Kelly became, at 37, the third youngest manager (and the youngest non-playing manager) to win a World Series. Only John McGraw, who won the 1905 World Series at 32, and Frank Chance, who won the 1907 World Series at 30, are younger.\nComposite box.\n1987 World Series (4–3): Minnesota Twins (A.L.) over St. Louis Cardinals (N.L.)\nAftermath.\nTwins manager Tom Kelly became the youngest non-playing manager to win the World Series since John McGraw in 1905.\nBy winning in the regulation nine innings, the Twins ensured the 1987 World Series was the first in which no games needed the bottom of the ninth inning. No other World Series since then has had that happen, as the two other Fall Classics in which the home team won every game—1991 and 2001—both included extra inning games and walk-off wins in the bottom of the ninth.\nAlthough Steve Carlton was not on the Twins' playoff roster, he still attended the White House to be congratulated by President Reagan. While making a photo op with the president, local newspapers listed the names of all of the Minnesota Twins. The only man who wasn't listed (and simply identified as a Secret Service agent) was a tall man wearing dark sunglasses in the back. The man in question was Carlton.\nAfter their defeat in the '87 Series, the Cardinals' reign of dominance in the '80s ended. They failed to win their division again until 1996, did not return to the World Series until 2004 and did not win until 2006 in a season where they won two fewer regular season games than the 1987 Twins.\nIn 1988, the Twins actually won more games than in their championship season, finishing with a 91–71 record. In spite of this improvement, they finished 13 games behind the AL West champion Oakland A's, who won 104 games. The Twins eventually sank towards the bottom of the standings, finishing last in 1990. In 1991, the Twins returned to the playoffs by beating the Blue Jays in the ALCS and winning what many call the greatest World Series every played, over the Atlanta Braves.\nThe 1987 World Series featured at least two players who went on to win \"Manager of the Year\" awards. The Twins' Don Baylor won it in 1995 for his work with the Colorado Rockies while the Cardinals' Tony Peña won it in 2003 for his efforts with the Kansas City Royals.\nThe success of the 1987 Twins inspired Brandon Walsh (Jason Priestley) in \"Beverly Hills 90210\" to explain why the Twins were the ultimate definition of a team, thus enabling him to win the Dreyer Scholarship. His interview, however, included a factual inaccuracy; he said Gladden hit a grand slam in Game 4, when in fact Gladden hit one in Game 1, and Hrbek hit one in the pivotal Game 6.\nSome years after the conclusion of the series it emerged that a lone Metrodome technician had, at his own initiative, tried to influence games on the Twins behalf by adjusting the air conditioning fans while the Twins were at bat. It remains unclear whether this had any effect on game play, or in particular, on games played at the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series.\nIn a February 2015 interview, sportscaster and author Al Michaels (who, as previously mentioned, did play-by-play for ABC's television coverage of the 1987 World Series) alleged the Twins pumped artificial crowd noise into the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. Responding to Michaels' theory, Twins President Dave St. Peter said that he did not think the Twins needed \"conspiracy theories\" in order to win the World Series. Instead, he argued that \"appreciation and respect\" should be paid to players like Frank Viola, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, and Kirby Puckett, who, he said, \"came out of nowhere to win a championship.\"\nThe 1987 World Series was the final one that ABC aired that went the full seven games. The next time that ABC broadcast a World Series, in 1989, the Oakland Athletics swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. For the final World Series that ABC would broadcast to date, 1995, they split the coverage with NBC. ABC only covered Games 1, 4 and 5, and would have broadcast a seventh game had it been necessary.\nAs of 2023, this is also the last time where three consecutive World Series went to seven games (1985, 1986, 1987)."

        "title": "Samoa national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Samoa national rugby union team represents the Samoa Rugby Union in men's international rugby union. They are also known as \"Manu Samoa\", which is thought to derive from the name of a Samoan warrior. They perform a traditional Samoan challenge called the siva tau before each game. Samoa Rugby Union were formerly members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) along with Fiji and Tonga. They are ranked 11th in the world.\nRugby was introduced to Samoa in the early 1920s and a governing body was soon formed. The first international was played as Western Samoa against Fiji in August 1924. Along with Tonga, these nations would meet regularly and eventually contest competitions such as the Pacific Tri-Nations – with Western Samoa winning the first of these. From 1924 to 1997 Samoa was known as Western Samoa.\nSamoa have been to every Rugby World Cup since the 1991 tournament. That tournament, along with the 1995 competition, saw them make the quarterfinals. Under their new coach, former New Zealand and Samoan international player Michael Jones, Samoa competed in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. However, Samoa had a dismal World Cup campaign, winning only one match and finishing fourth in their group. Samoa showed an improved performance at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, winning two matches by comfortable margins, and losing close matches to South Africa and Wales.\nHistory.\nThe Marist Brothers brought rugby to Western Samoa in 1924 and The Western Samoa Rugby Football Union was formed in 1924. On 18 August 1924, Western Samoa played its first international against Fiji in the capital Apia, the visitors winning 6–0. The match was played at 7am to allow the Samoans time to get to work afterwards and was played on a pitch with a large tree on the halfway line. The return match was won 9–3 by Samoa to draw the series.\nIn 1954 Western Samoa visited both Pacific Island neighbors Fiji and Tonga, but had to wait a further 20 years before a tour of New Zealand took place. The Samoans won one of eight matches on that tour.\nThe traditional tri-series between Tonga, Fiji and Western Samoa was established in 1982 with Western Samoa winning the first tournament. Wales visited Western Samoa and won the test 32–16 at Apia. The tour led to a return visit to Wales which brought Western Samoa out of International limbo, although Western Samoa were not invited to the first Rugby World Cup in 1987.\nThe following year a 14-match tour of Europe took place before a World Cup elimination series in Tokyo, which gave Western Samoa a place in the 1991 Rugby World Cup in Britain. They made a huge impact. After sweeping aside Wales 16–13 in Cardiff and defeating Argentina 35–12, and narrowly losing 3–9 to eventual champions Australia in their pool match, Western Samoa, a country with a population of 160,000, found itself in the quarterfinals against Scotland at Murrayfield. The Scots won comfortably 28–6, but the Samoans were clearly the personality team of the tournament. One Welsh fan ruefully remarked after Wales's defeat, \"It's a good job we weren't playing all of Samoa.\"\nOver the next two years, the side had a number of notable wins. The most outstanding achievements were in Sevens where it won the 1993 Hong Kong and 1992 Middlesex Sevens. The 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa proved that the team belonged in top company. They again reached the quarterfinals after wins over Argentina and Italy, but were beaten 42–14 by the eventual winners South Africa. After the Cup, Manu Samoa made a 13-match tour of England and Scotland, drawing 15–15 with the Scots and going down 27–9 to England.\nWith the advent of professional rugby in 1995 it was vital for Manu Samoa to develop a new administrative structure. This was made possible with Fay Richwhite and the Western Samoan Rugby Union joining forces to form Manu Samoa Rugby Limited. Fay Richwhite invested $5 million from 1995 to 2004 into Samoan rugby.\nSamoa emerged from the 1999 World Cup with its honor intact after another shock 38–31 victory over host nation Wales in the pool stages. They again lost out to Scotland in the quarterfinal play-off.\nManu Samoa qualified for the 2003 World Cup with a 17–16 loss against Fiji, Earl Va'a missing an injury-time penalty. They recovered to beat Tonga both home and away and avenged that Fijian defeat with a 22–12 win in Nadi. They ultimately had to settle for second place in the round robin, behind Fiji on points difference, and a place in the tougher of the two Rugby World Cup 2003 pools alongside automatic qualifiers England and South Africa. In one of the games of the tournament, they led eventual champions England for most of the game before losing 35–22.\nSamoa qualified for the 2011 World Cup after beating Papua New Guinea 73–12 in Port Moresby on 18 July 2009. They won 188–19 on aggregate over two matches against Papua New Guinea, having won 115–7 at Apia Park the previous week.\nSamoa began their 2011 World Cup campaign preparation with a flying start, after registering an upset against No.2 ranked Australia with a four-try-to-two win of 32–23.\nFinancial problems.\nIn November 2017, Samoa's prime minister and SRU chairman Tuilaepa Lupesoliai Sailele Malielegaoi announced that the organisation was bankrupt, although those claims were denied by world governing body World Rugby.\nWins against Tier 1 nations.\nSamoa have recorded 15 wins against tier 1 nations. In addition, Samoa drew with Scotland 15-15 on the 18 November 1995 at Murrayfield Stadium, Edinburgh, Scotland.\nOverall record.\nBelow is table of the representative rugby matches played by a Samoa national XV at test level up until 10 October 2023.\nWorld Cup record.\nIn one of the scenes of the feature film, \"Invictus\", Western Samoa can be seen playing South Africa in the 1995 Rugby World Cup.\nPacific Nations Cup.\nSamoa previously competed in the Pacific Tri-Nations winning 11 tournaments. The Pacific Nations Cup replaced the Tri-Nations tournament in 2006. Samoa have won four tournaments. \nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nSamoa announced their final squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup on 6 August 2023.\nHead coach: Mahonri Schwalger\nNew Zealand connection.\nWestern Samoa's triumph in the 1991 Rugby World Cup was inspired by their assistant coach Bryan Williams, who was a New Zealand-born (of Samoan descent) All Black great of the 1970s. The 1991 Samoan World Cup team included many New Zealand born or raised players; the catalyst was Auckland prop Peter Fatialofa, who in 1989, became the first major New Zealand-based player to play for Samoa. By the time of the 1991 World Cup several other New Zealand-born Samoans like Pat Lam, Stephen Bachop, Frank Bunce and Apollo Perelini had joined him. New Zealand born players with Samoan parentage have played for Samoa, such as Earl Va'a, Pat Lam and Lome Fa'atau.\nThe rugby relationship that exists between New Zealand and Samoa is a complex one. Close ties exist between the two countries, these bonds first being formed with the start of mass Polynesian migration to New Zealand in the latter half of the twentieth century. At the 2007 World Cup, there were 14 New Zealand-born players in the Samoan squad. The only team with more foreign born players in their squad was Italy who had 15.\nStrips.\nManu Samoa play in blue and white uniforms, with the home strip consisting of blue jerseys, white shorts and blue socks and the away kit being with the colours reversed. Since 2007, the flag of Samoa has been featured on the left sleeve and pe'a-like patterns were incorporated into the jerseys. Sponsored logos appear on jerseys for matches other than the Rugby World Cup, where branding, except for equipment manufacturers, is not allowed."

As the Super League Premiership the competition continued until 1997.\nHistory.\nFrom 1909 until 1973 (except for 1962–64) the Rugby Football League Championship used a play-off format to determine the league champions. For the 1973–74 season the league was split into two divisions, and a play-off system was no longer used.\nIn order to maintain interest towards the end of the season a new competition, the Club Championship, was introduced to replace the play-offs. The Harry Sunderland Trophy, which had until then been awarded to the man of the match in the championship final, was instead awarded in the premiership final.\nThe first season saw 16 teams take part: the top 12 of the first division and the top four from the second division. The following season saw the title change to \"Premiership\", and the format was altered so that only the top eight teams in the first division would compete. A similar competition was later instituted for clubs in the lower league(s). The Premiership continued to be played until 1995–96, and the switch to a summer sport, when the competition was abandoned to allow the 1996 Super League season to begin in the spring.\nA top-four play-off leading to a final, the Super League Premiership, was instituted as part of the Super League competition.

        "title": "Forfeit (baseball)",
        "text": "In rare cases, baseball games are forfeited, usually when a team is no longer able to play. Although not uncommon in baseball's early days, forfeits are now rare. There have been only five forfeits in Major League Baseball (MLB) since 1954; the last forfeit was in 1995, and prior to that, 1979. Since 1914, there has only been one incident where a team deliberately made a decision to forfeit a game, by the 1977 Baltimore Orioles.\nUsage.\nIn the event of forfeiture in Major League Baseball (MLB), the score is recorded as 9–0, as stated in rule 2.00 of the \"Official Baseball Rules\" issued by the league. The 9–0 score equates to one run per each regulation game inning not played. Actual game statistics are recorded as they stand at the time of the forfeit; the game is recorded as a loss in the standings for the forfeiting team and a win for the other team, even if the forfeiting team is ahead at that point. Leagues with seven-inning games, such as high school baseball or softball, generally award a rule-based score of 7–0. The same is true for Little League Baseball, per Rule 2.00, under the definition of \"Forfeit\", there is one run allocated per inning, resulting in scores of 6–0 or 7–0, depending on the division. If a game is already official (in an MLB game, this means if five innings were played, or innings if the home team is ahead) and the non-forfeiting team is ahead, then pitchers are credited for a win and loss using the same criteria as if the game were called for any other reason (such as weather); otherwise, no pitcher will be credited for a win, nor charged with a loss.\nIn college baseball, the NCAA has the authority to retroactively vacate results if the winning team is found to have violated NCAA rules; however although this is sometimes considered a retroactive \"forfeiture\" by fans and media, this is not actually the case, as for the losing team the loss is \"not\" retroactively changed to a win. The vacating of results is pursuant to a general NCAA rule that is not exclusive to baseball. In the NCAA, regardless of the sport, wins are usually vacated retroactively as a consequence of recruiting violations, if players or teams are caught violating the NCAA's strict rules regarding amateurism or if one or more players are otherwise found to have been ineligible to play for some reason. Retroactive forfeiture can happen for Little League World Series games, and occurred following the and events, in both cases after the offending teams were found to have fielded players in violation of age or residency restrictions.\nMLB forfeits.\nBefore 1960.\nIn the early days of the major leagues, forfeits were not rare. In 1871, six games were forfeited in two months. There was at least one forfeit almost every year from 1882 until 1909. 1884 saw forfeits in the double digits, many because one team failed to appear for a game or refused to continue playing. Game 2 of the 1885 World Series was forfeited when St. Louis pulled its team from the field to protest the umpiring. There were five forfeits in the National League in 1886.\nSometimes teams would forfeit games if they lacked enough players to take the field. During the 19th century, major league club rosters were typically much smaller than today since owners were often reluctant to spend more than absolutely necessary on payroll. Moreover, the fastest means of communication and transportation between cities was telegraph and railroad respectively, thus teams often could not replace players who became unavailable for whatever reason for several days. In addition, prior to the 20th century it was not uncommon for businessmen to outright own more than one team (or at least to have financial interests in multiple teams), obvious conflicts of interest that would later be prohibited. Often, such owners would unscrupulously transfer players from a weaker team to a stronger one, sometimes without regard to whether the weaker team would have enough players to play upcoming games. Particularly if the team was also floundering at the gate, ownership interests sometimes disregarded such considerations and forfeited one or more game(s).\nThe high rate of forfeits slowed after 1910, with one forfeit every few years. Game 7 of the 1934 World Series was in jeopardy of being forfeited when Detroit Tigers fans began showering the outfield with debris after St. Louis Cardinals left fielder Joe Medwick slid hard into Tigers third baseman Marv Owen. A potential blemish to the Series was averted when Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ordered both Medwick and Owen replaced in the one-sided game.\nIn games that were played before the advent of stadium lighting (and/or were subject to a relatively early curfew), forfeits were also sometimes declared as a result of a team's stalling tactics. A baseball game scheduled for nine innings is not official until five innings have been completed, or innings if the home team is winning. Consequently, a team that was behind by a considerable number of runs before the end of the fifth inning might deliberately slow down the game, in the hopes that darkness or the curfew would come before the game was declared official—this was because for most of baseball history, games ended before becoming official were re-played from the beginning at a later date. Such deliberate attempts to slow down play are subject to a forfeiture being declared. The last such major-league incident took place in 1954. On July 18, the visiting Philadelphia Phillies were leading the hometown St. Louis Cardinals, 8–1, in the fifth inning of the second game of a doubleheader. With darkness approaching and the game not yet official, Cardinals manager Eddie Stanky brought in three new pitchers in the inning. Umpire Babe Pinelli, citing an unnecessary delay of the game on the part of the Cardinals, forfeited the game to the Phillies. Starting with the 2020 season, MLB now more broadly uses suspended games, to avoid re-playing games from the beginning.\nThere are three known instances when MLB games were initially ruled a forfeit by umpires but the ruling was later overturned. Each occurred in the latter part of the season, in 1913 (later played to completion), in 1918 (doubleheader left unplayed), and in 1939 (set to be played to completion, but rained out and left as a tie). None had an effect on the postseason.\nSince 1960.\nForfeits have become extremely rare in MLB. The advent of night baseball eliminated the use of stalling tactics to beat the sunset, and any curfews still in force are much more lenient than in the past (for example, only prohibiting innings from starting after 1 am, long after a game is likely to be official). In the sort of extraordinary circumstances that would warrant a more stringent curfew in a city scheduled to host MLB games (such as the 1989 World Series earthquake), it is extremely unlikely that MLB would allow the game(s) to be played. In such cases, MLB typically reschedules the game(s) or moves the game(s) to the opponents' stadium or a neutral venue. In one exceptional case when the 2015 Baltimore protests caused local authorities to impose a curfew, MLB satisfied the terms of the curfew by ordering the affected game to be played earlier in the day and without spectators. Finally, major league rosters today are of a standard size with ample personnel to replace sick or injured players, and the modern minor league farm system as well as modern transportation and communication infrastructure allows teams to rapidly replace players unavailable for a longer period, meaning it is extremely unlikely that a team would be unable to play a game due to lack of players. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when teams occasionally had multiple players unable to play without warning, MLB opted for a policy of rescheduling games rather than forcing affected teams to forfeit.\nOf the five forfeits that have occurred in the expansion era of baseball (post-1960), all but one have been the result of fans disrupting the game to a point where the stadium staff cannot control them, at which point the home team is forced to forfeit."

        "title": "Australian Rugby Shield",
        "text": "The Australian Rugby Shield is a rugby union competition in Australia. It was launched in 2000 by the Australian Rugby Union (ARU), now Rugby Australia (RA). The competition was intended to unearth new talent outside of the existing rugby strongholds of Sydney and Brisbane. The competition was suspended after the 2008 season, but has since been revived.\nThe tournament was an important step in the development of rugby union in Australia, and provided an opportunity for Rugby Australia to identify and unearth talented players nationally. It provided regional teams and developing unions with a regular schedule to compete against each other at a higher level than would normally be possible within their individual states or territories.\nConducted under rules and regulations similar to the Super Rugby, the competition aimed to assist players, coaches, managers and referees in their professional development. It provided a pathway to full representative level including education in coaching, selecting and refereeing.\nHistory.\nThe Australian Rugby Shield was first contested in 2000, with six teams playing a single round robin over five weekends and the top two teams playing in the final. The teams in the inaugural season were the Adelaide Black Falcons, Darwin Mosquitoes, Melbourne Axemen, New South Wales Country Cockatoos, Perth Gold, and Queensland Country Heelers. The New South Wales and Queensland Country teams met in the final, played as the curtain-raiser to the Bledisloe Cup match held at Stadium Australia in front of a record rugby crowd of 109,874. Queensland Country won in an upset, 23-17.\nNew South Wales Country went on to win the next two titles, before Perth claimed their first Australian Rugby Shield in 2003.\nA first-past-the-post system was put in place in 2004, eliminating the requirement for a final. In 2006, two additional teams were added, the Tasmania Jack Jumpers and the ACT &amp; Southern NSW Vikings team that won the Australian Rugby Shield on their first attempt. The competition was split into two pools in a three-week round robin competition with the winners and runners up in each pool progressing to the semi-finals (27 May 2006) and cross-pool Final (3 June 2006). Contracted Super Rugby and academy players were excluded.\nIn 2007, the tournament reverted to a 6-team home-and-away round-robin tournament, without Perth and the Vikings. These two teams were excluded as the ARU determined that the local competitions were sufficient to foster talent for the new Australian Rugby Championship teams, the Perth Spirit and Canberra Vikings, respectively.\nAt the end of 2008, and citing the difficult economic environment, the ARU declared that the 2009 Australian Rugby Shield would be suspended. The involvement of the Australia A team in the Pacific Nations Cup was also cancelled.\nNRC Division 2 (2018−2020).\nAn Emerging States Championship was formed in 2018 for representative teams from smaller rugby unions within Australia. There had been no regular competition for these teams since the demise of Australian Rugby Shield a decade earlier. The new tournament was hosted by Rugby Union South Australia in Adelaide and featured the South Australia Black Falcons, Victoria Country Barbarians, Northern Territory Mosquitoes and Tasmania Jack Jumpers. The Black Falcons were the inaugural winners. The tournament was rebranded as NRC Division 2 for 2019, with eight representative teams invited:\nRevival of the Competition.\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, Rugby Australia suffered severe economic hardship, nearing bankruptcy. These financial issues were quickly turned around by a new board and led to the reintroduction of the Australian Rugby Shield and Australia ‘A’ competitions from the 2022 season.\nHeld in Adelaide, teams participated from ACT &amp; Southern New South Wales, New South Wales Country, Outback Queensland, Queensland Country, Rugby Tasmania, Rugby Victoria &amp; Rugby Western Australia.\nThe ACT and Southern New South Wales Griffins were crowned champions defeating NSW Country 34–31 in the Grand Final at Brighton Oval, Adelaide.\nThe 2022 Australian Rugby Shield also had a women's competition, with Victoria defeating all who stood before them.\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2022 edition, Rugby Australia came under scrutiny for not promoting the competition enough, resulting a lack of awareness in the rugby community it was taking place. Critics did praise the return of the competition as a whole, calling it a significant step in growing rugby union in regional areas.\nTelevision coverage.\nFrom 2000 to 2008, the competition was broadcast on national television by the digital channel ABC2. It showcased two of the Australian Rugby Shield matches each round.\nIn 2022, games were only available to watch via YouTube. This contributed to the criticism that Rugby Australia received in relation to the lack of the promotion this tournament received."

        "title": "Kenya national cricket team",
        "text": "The Kenya men's national cricket team represents the Republic of Kenya in international cricket. Kenya is an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) which has Twenty20 International (T20I) status after the ICC granted T20I status to all its members.\nThey have been an associate member of the ICC since 1981. Since then they have played in five Cricket World Cups from 1996 to 2011 with their best result being a bronze medal finish as the semi-final appearance at the 2003 Cricket World Cup in Southern Africa. They have only qualified for one ICC World Twenty20 tournament, in 2007. The Kenyan national team is governed by Cricket Kenya.\nKenya gained One Day International (ODI) status in 1996 in preparation for the 1996 Cricket World Cup and would have it for eighteen years before losing it at the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier where they finished in the fifth place. After April 2019, Kenya will play in the 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nHistory.\nEast Africa team.\nKenya, Tanzania and Uganda combined to form the East Africa cricket team, which became an associate member of the ICC in 1966. They continued playing amongst themselves, and were joined by Zambia in a quadrangular tournament played annually between 1966 and 1980.\nIndia toured East Africa in 1967 and played a three-day match against Kenya on 5 August, which was drawn. Various tours of, and by, East Africa continued, including a tour of England in 1972 and a first-class match between East Africa and the MCC at Nairobi Gymkhana Club in 1974 before East Africa took part in the first Cricket World Cup.\nThe 1975 Cricket World Cup took place in England, and East Africa were one of two non-test teams invited to the tournament, the other being Sri Lanka. Kenya provided half of the fourteen-man squad for the tournament. After warm-up matches against Somerset, Wales, Glamorgan and various club sides, they played in the same first round group as England, India and New Zealand, losing to all three. The World Cup was followed by a first-class match against Sri Lanka at the County Ground, Taunton.\nEast Africa then took part in the 1979 ICC Trophy, the first ICC Trophy tournament, but did not progress beyond the first round, thus missing out on qualification for the 1979 World Cup.\nICC membership.\nLong considered the strongest part of the East Africa team, Kenya broke away in 1981 and joined the ICC in their own right as an associate member, shortly after a tour of Zimbabwe in 1980/81. They played two three-day matches against Zimbabwe on that tour, losing both. Kenya played in the ICC Trophy in their own right in 1982, 1986, and 1990, also playing their first first-class match against Pakistan B in September 1986.\n1996 World Cup.\nThe 1994 ICC Trophy was hosted in Nairobi and Kenya finished as runners-up to the UAE, thus qualifying for the 1996 World Cup. Kenya then played at home against India A in August 1995, and went on a tour to South Africa in September/October that year, before playing in the World Cup, which was to bring Kenyan cricket to a much wider audience, and catapult them into the spotlight.\nKenya were in the same group as Australia, India, Sri Lanka, the West Indies and Zimbabwe. They played their very first ODI match against India.\nIn what at the time was described as the most startling upsets in the history of the World Cup, Kenya bowled out the West Indies for just 93 and won by 73 runs.\nThe Kenya national team arrived in India for its maiden World Cup, having players like Steve Tikolo, Maurice Odumbe and Thomas Odoyo. The team was expected to be crushed by the full member sides in its group and this proved to be correct in most of their matches. But the highlights of their campaign was beating former World Champions the West Indies in a low-scoring affair.\nODI status.\nFollowing their World Cup performance, Kenya were given full ODI status by the ICC, and hosted a quadrangular tournament against Pakistan, South Africa and Sri Lanka in September/October 1996. The Netherlands toured in December, playing four one-day matches, with the Kenyans winning them all. They played in the quarter finals of South Africa's Standard Bank Cup in March 1997, losing to Natal by 104 runs at Kingsmead. Following this was the 1997 ICC Trophy, hosted in Malaysia. Kenya reached the final, where they lost to Bangladesh by two wickets. This was followed by a tri-series against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in October the same year in Nairobi.\nEngland A were the first opposition in 1998, touring Kenya in January. A three-day match was drawn, with England A winning the only one-day match that was not abandoned due to the weather. After this was another spot in the quarter final of the Standard Bank Cup, this time losing to Gauteng by 8 wickets. Kenya visited India in May, playing a triangular ODI series against Bangladesh and India. In the final match of the round-robin stage, Kenya pulled off an upset by beating India by 69 runs.\nKenya then competed in the cricket tournament at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. Drawn in the same first round group as New Zealand, Pakistan and Scotland, Kenya only beat the Scots, and finished third in the points table for the group.\nKenya warmed up for the 1999 World Cup with a triangular series in Bangladesh against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe. In the 1999 World Cup itself, they were placed in the same first round group as England, India, South Africa, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe. Following warm-up games against Somerset, Gloucestershire and Glamorgan, they lost all five of their games in the tournament proper. Following the World Cup, they played a quadrangular tournament at home against India, South Africa and Zimbabwe, again losing all their games.\nThe 21st century started for Kenya with a visit to Zimbabwe to play in the ICC Emerging Nations Tournament against Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, Scotland and Zimbabwe A. Kenya won the tournament and took this form onto a seven-match tour of India on which they lost just one game. Pakistan A toured Kenya in July, playing a five match one-day series and a four-day first-class match. The four-day match was drawn, and Kenya won the one-day series 4–1. The 2000 ICC KnockOut Trophy was played in Nairobi in October, with Kenya falling to India at the first hurdle.\nThe first opponents for Kenya in 2001 were Sri Lanka A, who toured Kenya in January, playing two first-class matches and four one-day matches. Both first-class matches were drawn, and Sri Lanka A won the first two one-day games, with the final two being abandoned. The West Indies came in August for two first-class games and a three-match ODI series. The first first-class game was won by the West Indies, with the second being drawn, and the three ODIs all went the way of the visitors. Kenya then played an ODI triangular tournament in South Africa in October, against India and the hosts, and picked up a second ODI win over India.\nZimbabwe A toured Kenya towards the end of the year, losing a first-class series 1–0 and a one-day series 3–2.\nKenya toured Sri Lanka in early 2002, playing three first-class and three one-day matches against Sri Lanka A. Sri Lanka A won all three of the first-class games, but Kenya won the one-day series 2–1. The MCC toured Kenya shortly after this, playing one three-day match and six one-day matches against the national side. Five of the one-day matches went the way of the Kenyans before the sixth one-day match and the three-day match were abandoned. Kenya then played in the ICC 6 Nations Challenge tournament in Windhoek, Namibia, playing against Canada, Namibia, the Netherlands, Sri Lanka A and Zimbabwe A. Kenya won the tournament, beating Sri Lanka A by 3 wickets in the final. In August/September, Kenya hosted an ODI triangular tournament against Australia and Pakistan, losing all four of their matches. This was followed by a place in the 2002 ICC Champions Trophy, though Kenya lost to the West Indies and South Africa, failing to progress beyond the first round.\nNamibia toured Kenya in November, playing four one-day games. Kenya won the series 2–1, with one game being abandoned. Kenya then toured Zimbabwe to round off the year, playing three one-day matches against Zimbabwe A, and a three-match ODI series against the full Zimbabwean side. Zimbabwe won the ODI series 2–0, with one match finishing in a no result, and Zimbabwe A won their series against Kenya 2–1.\n2003 World Cup and decline.\nThe 2003 Cricket World Cup was to be Kenya's finest moment in international cricket to date. The tournament was held in South Africa, with Kenya hosting their two matches against Sri Lanka and New Zealand. The tournament started with a defeat to South Africa, but Kenya bounced back with a four wicket win over Canada in Cape Town. New Zealand forfeited their match against Kenya in Nairobi due to safety concerns, but Sri Lanka did visit Nairobi and much to their dismay lost by 53 runs as Kenya pulled off another upset victory.\nThe tournament continued, back in South Africa, with a win over Bangladesh and a defeat to the West Indies. Kenya had done enough to qualify for the Super Six stage, becoming the first non-test nation to progress beyond the first round of the World Cup. In the Super Six stage, they lost to India and Australia, but beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets, qualifying for the semi-final, where they lost to India by 91 runs.\nKenya's World Cup success was rewarded with a spot in a quadrangular tournament at the Sharjah Cricket Association Stadium against Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, but they lost all three of their games.\nKenya's failure in the above tournament is perhaps indicative of how they failed to capitalise on their World Cup success, though it must be said that not all of that failure was on the field. Although Kenya were given plenty of matches against national A sides, and played in the Carib Beer Cup in the West Indies in 2004, Kenya only played two ODIs in the three years after the Sharjah tournament, against India and Pakistan in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy.\nOff-field setbacks also occurred. Maurice Odumbe was banned for match-fixing in August 2004, and a series of strikes by players led to a weakened Kenyan side being eliminated from the inaugural ICC Intercontinental Cup at the semi-final stage by Scotland. By the end of the dispute in 2005, Kenyan cricket had no sponsors and was in virtual international isolation. At that stage the governing body had dissolved internally and Kenyan cricket opportunities were limited and international cricket for them had virtually ceased.\nRebuilding.\n2005 to 2007.\nA rebuilding process began in 2005. The player strikes ceased, and Kenya again reached the semi-finals of the Intercontinental Cup. They warmed up for the semi-finals in Windhoek with a tour of Zimbabwe, to play two first-class and one one-day match against Zimbabwe A. They won all three of those games, and drew against Bermuda in the semi-final of the 2005 ICC Intercontinental Cup but lost to Ireland in the final, despite scoring 404/4 in their first innings.\nIn early 2006, the Kenya Cricket Association was disbanded and replaced by Cricket Kenya. The rebuilding process was in full swing as Kenya began playing ODI cricket again. Their return to ODI cricket was a five match series against Zimbabwe, which was drawn 2–2 with one match abandoned. This was followed by a four match ODI series against Bangladesh, with Kenya losing all four matches in that series. Their 2006 ICC Intercontinental Cup campaign got off to a poor start with a draw against the Netherlands and a defeat to Canada, but they bounced right back with two ODI wins over Canada at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club. Bangladesh toured Kenya in August, winning all three ODIs, before an Intercontinental Cup draw against Bermuda and three ODI wins over Bermuda.\nA triangular tournament in Mombasa against Canada and Scotland began Kenya's 2007 and Kenya won the tournament. They then hosted Division One of the World Cricket League at three grounds in Nairobi, playing against Bermuda, Canada, Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland. Kenya also won this event, beating Scotland in the final. This was followed by the 2007 World Cup, Kenya's fourth World Cup. Kenya beat Canada in the first round, but lost to England and New Zealand, thus missing out on the Super Eight stage.\nIn October 2007, either side of Intercontinental Cup games, Kenya hosted Canada in two ODIs and then Bermuda in three. Kenya won all five matches, with strong bowling performances setting up relatively comfortable chases batting second.\n2008 to 2011.\nIn August 2008, after a break of nine months without a One Day or Twenty20 International, Kenya toured Ireland, Scotland and the Netherlands for various series. It proved a disappointing tour overall, with rain and poor Kenyan batting performances being the main themes.\nKenya initially participated in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier in Belfast, Northern Ireland,\nthe associate qualification tournament for the 2009 ICC World Twenty20. One of the favourites at the start of the tournament, they finished second in Group B with a loss to the Netherlands and a win over Canada, but losses to Ireland and Scotland in the knock-out stages meant that they finished fourth and thus failed to qualify for the World Twenty20.\nKenya then participated in three ODI series across Europe, but these merely resulted in two wash-outs against Scotland, defeat in a rain-affected one-off match to the Netherlands, and losing a three-match series against Ireland 1–0 with two matches affected by rain.\nIn October 2008, Kenya hosted Ireland and Zimbabwe in an ODI series in Nairobi, but after a loss to Ireland and a win over Zimbabwe, their last three matches were all abandoned due to rain. After this washed-out series, Kenya then travelled to South Africa for two ODIs, losing heavily in both.\nIn late January and early February 2009, Kenya played five ODIs at home against Zimbabwe, but lost all of them.\nSince the World Cup, a team known as Kenya Select has taken part in Zimbabwe's Logan Cup competition, but did not win a game, also losing to Zimbabwe A.\nIn their opening match of World Cup 2011 campaign, Kenya faced a mammoth defeat from New Zealand by 10 wickets, they were bowled out for 69 runs and New Zealand won the match in just 8 overs without the loss of a wicket.\nIn 2011, Kenya was whitewashed by the Netherlands national cricket team in a short 2 match ODI series played in Sportspark Westvielt, Voorburg. During this series, Kenya's weak batting was noted. They made only 208/8 in the first match and an even smaller 184/8 in the second match. Seren Waters and Collins Obuya (the national team captain) did, however, have notable performances – the former making 71 in the first match and the latter scoring 54 in the second match.\nReforms in 2011.\nFor years, the Kenyan players had been the Associate nations' most pampered professionals. The first time Cricket Kenya's notice was attracted was when during the 2011 ODI World Cup, there were reports of internal dissent between the team, as the team had a disastrous World Cup, losing all six of their games. Cricket Kenya announced that it would review the World Cup debacle after the tournament was over. This was the beginning of a series of reforms initiated by the board.\nFollowing the reviews, the board replaced the former Sahara Elite League with the East African tournaments. While the East Africa Premier League is a Twenty20 tournament, the East African Cup is a 50-over tournament. It is currently hoped that this tournaments will produce further new young talents for Kenya in the future. Within months, the East African tournaments were regarded in high esteem and the intensity was up to the brink, as an ESPNcricinfo interview with Cricket Kenya CEO Tom Sears revealed.\nAnother important reform brought in by the board was to dump the old guard. As described by Cricinfo journalist Martin Williamson, the old guard was not committed to performance and was more keen to selfish gains. The new contracts had completely cut ties with the past, with Collins Obuya, the new captain, being the oldest player at 29. Experienced players like the former captain Jimmy Kamande, a veteran of five World Cups, Thomas Odoyo, and others were not even considered. As was expected, the left-out players were quick to retort as Kamande said that \"the board was selecting players who would be their puppets\", while Odoyo opined that \"it was malicious and not done in good faith\". According to them, it was fast-tracking the death of Kenyan cricket. They were also supported by the Kenyan media.\nAmong the 20 cricketers offered contracts, 13 of them were offered central contracts. To complicate things further, five players turned down those contracts: Alex Obanda, Shem Ngoche, James Ngoche, Nehemiah Odhiambo, and Elijah Otieno. Sears said that they were pleased with the group of seven players who committed to Cricket Kenya, while equally disappointed with those who refused contracts. Accordingly, they were left out of the squad to face the UAE in the ICC Intercontinental Cup.\nCricket Kenya offered contracts to more deserving young, talented players, such as opening batsman Runish Gudhka from Nairobi, the Australian-born all-rounder Duncan Allan, wicketkeeper Irfan Karim, and impressive fast bowlers such as Emmanuel Ringera, Ibrahim Akello, and Dominic Wesonga, who had performed exceedingly well in the regional NPCA and East African leagues.\nHowever, the eight players who had refused the contracts offered by the board, with former skipper Morris Ouma, Alfred Luseno and Nelson Odhiambo being late inclusions, asked their views to be heard, and despite the board granting them another chance, they finally took a firm stance against them. While Obanda, Shem and James Ngoche, Odhiambo, and Otieno were made renewed offers, while Ouma, Luseno, and Nelson had a three-month agreement till March 2012 subject to performance. If they could do something good, they could retain their spot in the team. Sears said of this debacle,\"It's a shame that yet again some of these players have turned down their contracts but that is their choice. We met with these players as we promised we would, we listened to their views and made them offers that reflected what they wanted – an agreement that would run until the end of the contract year in May 2012 if they met certain performance criteria which all players have to meet. Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was that they refused to represent their teams in the East African Competitions last weekend pulling out at the very last minute. Again sadly it calls into question the professionalism of these players, how committed they are to putting in the effort, their application in fulfilling their potential and the advice they have been getting from their advisors.\"\nAnother reform was to appoint the former Otago coach Mike Hesson as the national coach. Immediately afterwards, Hesson announced that he was here to resolve and put to end the dispute between the players and the board. He said that in an interview to the newspaper Otago Daily Times.\nThe East Africa finals were rescheduled from October to December 2011 due to heavy showers in Nairobi at that time. However, once again, heavy showers in December led the finals again being postponed to January 2012.\nLoss of ODI status: 2014–present.\nKenya lost their ODI status after 18 years when they finished outside the top 4 in the 2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier also failing to qualify for the 2015 Cricket World Cup.\nFurther failures in the World Cricket League meant that Kenya couldn't regain their ODI status while being subsequently relegated to the new Challenge League.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 cricket matches played between Kenya and other ICC members since 1 January 2019 have been full T20I matches.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Kenya in the past 12 months or has been part of the latest squad.

Listed at , 180 lb., he batted and threw right-handed. Bradley was one of many baseball players whose career was interrupted during World War II.\nBradley was signed by the New York Yankees in 1940 and immediately was assigned to their minor league system. In 1941 and 1942, he averaged 15 wins per season before joining the U.S. Navy in 1943.\nFollowing his military discharge, Bradley pitched in the Yankees' AAA system during 1946 and 1947. In 1948 he was dealt by New York, along Aaron Robinson and Bill Wight, to the White Sox in exchange for Eddie Lopat.\nIn 1948 Bradley posted a 4.60 earned run average in eight relief appearances for the White Sox and did not have a decision. He opened 1949 in the minor leagues and made one start with Chicago in May, after which he returned to the minors for two more seasons.\nBradley went 0–0 with a 5.60 ERA in nine games, allowing eleven earned runs on 15 hits and seven walks while striking out two in 17⅔ innings of work. In a six-year minor league career, he went 61–52 with a 3.63 ERA in 172 games."

In the first stage, the 34 teams were divided in 10 groups of three teams each and two groups of two teams each. Groups with three teams had two rounds, with the best ranked team according to FIFA in each group entering the competition in the second round. In each group, teams were paired 2-by-2 and played home-and-away matches.\nThe 12 winners of the second stage advanced to the third stage, where they were divided into three groups of four teams each. Teams in each group would play against each other home-and-away, and the two teams with most points in each group would advance to the final round.\nIn the fourth stage, the six teams were put in a single group, and played against each other home-and-away.

        "title": "History of cycling in New Zealand",
        "text": "The bicycle originally reached New Zealand in the 1860s in the form of the velocipede, also known as the 'boneshaker'. These bikes, as elsewhere, soon evolved into the elegant 'high wheelers', known today as penny-farthings. Popular among wealthy young men, these offered adventure and speed (\"Colonials like to get along fast\", one newspaper wrote), but were also dangerous due to the lack of modern features like efficient brakes. Additionally the fact that they were useless on the rough and hilly roads of most of the country, ensured that they were seldom used for anything other than sport and recreation. \nBy the late 1880s, the safety bicycle was being produced: with a lower frame and pneumatic tyres, it was a popular model for women to ride, and consequently brought about a new form of freedom for them. Kate Sheppard was involved with the first cycle club in Christchurch in 1892: the Atalanta Cycle Club. The bicycle has therefore been credited as significant in bringing women's enfranchisement to New Zealand.\nIt was the 'safety bicycle', with its chain, sprockets and similar sized wheels that catapulted the bicycle into the public arena. Sales boomed, prices dropped and, for half a century, the bicycle became a transport of the masses, at least in the somewhat more level and developed areas of the country.\nCycle tracks were being built alongside some main roads in 1949 and 1950.\nHowever, in the 1950s and 60s, driven by rising affluence and government transport policies, New Zealanders turned away from most other transport methods to become one of the countries with the highest car ownership ratios in the world. This largely relegated cycling once again to recreational and sports use.\nThe oil shocks of the 1970s triggered the first of several bicycle resurgences. New bicycles became popular: first, road racing bikes, then BMXs and eventually mountain bikes. By 1990, a survey showed cycling to be the second most popular participation sport in New Zealand. Since then, cycle sales have remained high, averaging over 150,000 per annum.\nFrom January 1994 the wearing of bicycle helmets in New Zealand became mandatory for all ages of people using a bicycle."

        "text": "Bradley Alan Miller (born April 12, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player. The two-time NBA All-Star played for six National Basketball Association (NBA) teams.\nCollege career.\nAfter playing prep school basketball for a season in Maine at MCI Maine Central Institute, Miller returned to his home state to attend Purdue University, located in West Lafayette, Indiana, where he played under head coach Gene Keady and assistant coaches Bruce Weber and Frank Kendrick. During his freshman season, along with senior Cuonzo Martin, he led the Boilermakers to a 25–7 record. Along the way, he was part of a Big Ten Conference Title and an NCAA Second Round appearance. He averaged 6.5 points and 5.4 rebounds a game.\nDuring his sophomore season, Miller helped lead Purdue, along with fellow sophomore Chad Austin, to a three-peat conference title and a consecutive NCAA Second Round appearance. The Boilers finished the season with a 26–6 overall record. Miller averaged 9.6 points and 5.5 rebounds on the season.\nMiller's junior season showed more progress than the prior season, averaging 14.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a game. Finishing second in the conference, Miller, along with teammate and former NBA player Brian Cardinal, helped the Boilers to a third straight NCAA Second Round finish. They beat Rhode Island in overtime, where Brad scored 31 points, grabbed eight rebounds and set a school tournament record with made/attempted free throws, going 15–21 from the line. He finished his junior season with an 18–12 record. Throughout his junior year, Miller became the only center in Purdue history to lead the team in assists.\nMiller had his best college season during his senior year, helping with a 28–8 record. Averaging 17.2 points and 8.8 rebounds in his last season at Purdue, he led the Boilermakers to a Sweet Sixteen appearance and a 2nd overall seed in the NCAA Tournament. Miller set a school tournament record with 6 steals in a win against Delaware. His last collegiate game was a loss to Stanford. Miller's biggest game of his senior season came against Michigan State, where he scored 30 points and pulled down 12 rebounds to force Michigan State to share their Big Ten crown.\nDuring his career at Purdue, Miller became one of only six players (Joe Barry Carroll, Terry Dischinger, Walter Jordan, Robbie Hummel, and Zach Edey) to record 800 rebounds and the first player in school history to have 1,500 points, 800 rebounds, and 250 assists.\nProfessional career.\nLivorno (1998).\nAfter college, because of the NBA lockout, Miller started his career in the Italian Serie A with Bini Viaggi Livorno for three months.\nCharlotte Hornets (1999–2000).\nMiller was then signed by the Charlotte Hornets as an undrafted free agent in 1999. He played for the Hornets for two seasons. On March 24, 1999, he had 25 points, going 9–9 shooting and 7–7 from the line. On May 5, 1999 scored a season high 32 points to go along with 13 rebounds in a win against the Boston Celtics. The Hornets made it to the playoffs the following season where they lost 1–3 to the Philadelphia 76ers. In his first playoff series, Miller averaged 7.5 points on 52 percent shooting.\nChicago Bulls (2000–2002).\nAfter two seasons with the Hornets, Miller signed with the Chicago Bulls as a free agent. In January 2002, he was involved in an on-court altercation with center Shaquille O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers. After he and Charles Oakley gave a hard foul on O'Neal, Miller walked away as O'Neal swung at the back of his head; O'Neal would be suspended three games. Nearly doubling his playing time with the Bulls, he averaged 12.7 points a game, shooting 46 percent during the 2001–02 season.\nIndiana Pacers (2002–2003).\nIn February 2002, Miller was traded by the Bulls with Ron Mercer, Ron Artest (now Metta Sandiford-Artest) and Kevin Ollie to the Indiana Pacers for Jalen Rose, Travis Best, Norman Richardson, and a second-round draft pick. He wrapped up the 2001–02 season with a 15.1 points and 8.2 rebounds per game average. During his first and only complete season with the Pacers, he made his first NBA All-Star Team becoming one of the first undrafted players to be named an All-Star along with the Detroit Pistons' Ben Wallace the same year. The Pacers clinched a playoff berth for the 6th season in a row, where they lost to the Celtics, 2–4.\nSacramento Kings (2003–2009).\nDuring the 2003 offseason, Miller was involved in a sign-and-trade with the Sacramento Kings. He was signed to a multi-year deal by Indiana and then traded to the Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard. In the same trade, the Kings sent Hedo Türkoğlu to San Antonio Spurs, San Antonio traded Danny Ferry to Indiana and Indiana traded Ron Mercer to San Antonio. While signing with the Kings, Miller stated, \"I wanted to stay with Indiana but my agent said that the money I could make with Sacramento was just too good to pass up and I would never get this kind of contract again.\" On November 21, 2003, Miller recorded his first career triple-double with 22 points, 14 rebounds, and 10 assists in a win over the Orlando Magic. Less than a month later, Miller recorded another triple-double with 18 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists. Averaging 14.1 points and 10.3 rebounds in his first season with the Kings, he was voted to back-to-back NBA All-Star Game appearances. In the playoffs, Sacramento lost the Western Conference Semifinals 3–4 to the Minnesota Timberwolves.\nMiller appeared in only 56 games during his second season in Sacramento, yet averaging his career high of 15.6 points a game. On February 2, 2005 Miller scored a career-high 38 points to go along with 17 rebounds in a win over the Golden State Warriors. Two days later scored his first back-to-back 30 points game with 35 against the New York Knicks. In the playoffs, Miller averaged a career-high 11.2 points but the Kings lost 1–4 to the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round. In middle of the 2005–06 season, he became the first center since Sam Lacey in 1981 to record back-to-back double-doubles in both points and assists. After a career best 1,182 points scored during the season, the following 2006–07 season brought lower averages and totals of the previous five years. On April 10, 2007 Miller recorded his third career triple-double with 17 points, 10 rebounds and a career-high 11 assist.\nOn January 14, 2009, Miller recorded his first 30/20 game with 30 points and a career-high 22 rebounds in a win over the Golden State Warriors. He finished his five and a half seasons with the Kings averaging just over 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 4 assists a game.\nReturn to Chicago (2009–2010).\nOn February 18, 2009, the Kings reached a tentative agreement to trade Miller and John Salmons to the Chicago Bulls for Drew Gooden, Andrés Nocioni, Michael Ruffin (later traded to Portland Trail Blazers for Ike Diogu) and Cedric Simmons. As a veteran presence on a young team, Miller added depth in the paint with forward/center Joakim Noah to compete in the 2009 NBA Playoffs after a two-year absence of postseason play while with the Kings. On April 28, Miller received a busted lip by Boston Celtics guard Rajon Rondo, and missed game-decisive free-throws at the end of game 5 of the Eastern Conference First Round. During game six of the 7-overtime series and after receiving 7 stitches for his lip, he posted a double-double with 23 points and 10 rebounds, shooting 8 for 9 from the floor. Miller averaged 10.3 points, 7.9 rebounds, and 1.3 assists during the seven-game series in the 2009 Playoffs. He made 5 of 7 three point field goals (71.4%) and shot 79.2 percent from the free throw line.\nHouston Rockets (2010–2011).\nOn July 17, 2010, Miller signed a three-year contract with the Houston Rockets, worth $15 million. He was expected to back up Yao Ming and provide the Rockets a valuable insurance policy. On November 12, 2010, in Miller's first start after coming to the Rockets, he scored 23 points, grabbed 8 rebounds, and gave out 5 assists. On December 3, 2010, Miller tied his season-high 23 points, going a perfect 7-7 from the field, including 3-3 from downtown, and 6-7 from the foul line.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2011–2012).\nDuring the 2011 NBA Draft, Miller was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves, along with the rights of Nikola Mirotić, in a deal that sent the rights of Donatas Motiejunas and Jonny Flynn to Houston. Due to microfracture knee surgery on his left knee while a member of the Rockets in May 2011, he was doubtful to begin playing for the Wolves at the projected start of the 2011-12 season (which was delayed due to the owners' lockout) - or indeed at all.\nOn January 12, 2012, Miller practiced with the team for the first time, strictly in half-court situations to protect his knee. He made his debut with the team on January 29, 2012. In an interview with Yahoo! Sports, he announced that the 2011-2012 season would be his final season. After the season, however, Miller's agent said that Miller was undecided about retiring.\nOn July 13, 2012, Miller was traded to the New Orleans Hornets, then traded to the Phoenix Suns as part of a three-team deal on July 27, 2012. He was waived by the Suns on August 15, 2012, when the team signed Jermaine O'Neal. Miller later reaffirmed his decision to retire.\nInternational career.\nShortly after finishing his college career, Brad joined the US national team in the 1998 FIBA World Championship. During the time of the NBA lockout, there were no players from the league on the team. With fellow former Purdue standout Jimmy Oliver, Miller led the USA team to the bronze medal. He played under NBA coach Rudy Tomjanovich.\nMiller was selected as a member of the U.S. squad that competed in the 2006 FIBA World Championship, where he played along with fellow NBA players, such as LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony and Dwight Howard. After much hype over the improvement of the team, the tournament ended in disappointment with a loss to Greece in the semifinal game. The team finished with the bronze medal by defeating Argentina. Despite pre-tournament assertions that the U.S. needed a good-shooting big man like Miller, he rarely played in the tournament and did not log any playing time in the decisive semifinal loss. The team was coached by Duke's head coach Mike Krzyzewski.\nCareer notes.\nDespite his size, Miller did not fit the mold of a traditional center. He only averaged double-digit rebounds once in his career and never averaged more than 1.2 blocks per season.\nIn 2005–2006, Miller averaged 4.7 assists per game, good for 29th in the league but far above what other centers averaged (Ben Wallace was second among centers with 1.9 APG). The Princeton offense run by the Kings both allowed and demanded Miller to be a good passer, and he was typically recognized as one of the best-passing big men in the league. Miller also added a three-point shot to his game."

        "text": "Sammy Charles White (July 7, 1927 – August 4, 1991) was an American Major League Baseball catcher and right-handed batter who played with the Boston Red Sox (1951–59), Milwaukee Braves (1961) and Philadelphia Phillies (1962). He was a solid defensive catcher, with a good arm and the ability to get the most out of a Boston pitching staff that included Mel Parnell, Ellis Kinder, Bill Monbouquette, Mike Fornieles and Frank Sullivan.\nWhite was born in Wenatchee, Washington. A college baseball player and All-American college basketball player at the University of Washington, he signed his first professional baseball contract with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League in 1949. After the 1949 minor league season ended, the Minneapolis Lakers asked White to join their National Basketball Association team. But the Red Sox, who had acquired White's contract during 1949, were furious and prevented White from doing that.\nOn June 11, 1952, White hit a ninth-inning grand slam off of Satchel Paige, turning a 9–7 deficit into an 11–9 walk-off victory over the St. Louis Browns. After rounding third base, White dropped to the ground and crawled to home, kissing the plate. An All-Star in 1953, White enjoyed his best season with the bat in 1954, hitting .282 with 14 home runs and 75 runs batted in (RBIs). In a May 1, 1955, game against the Cleveland Indians, White ruined Bob Feller's no-hitter with a single in the 7th inning. Feller posted a 2–0 shutout, and set a major league record with his 12th one-hitter in that game. After nine productive years in Boston, White was traded to the Cleveland Indians just before the outset of the 1960 season. But White balked at the trade (even though Cleveland was a pennant contender and the Red Sox were an also-ran at the time) and retired, sitting out the season. Granted his release, he played for the Braves in 1961, and finished his career with Philadelphia one year later, playing for a former Red Sox teammate, skipper Gene Mauch. In eleven seasons, he was a career .262 hitter with 66 homers and 421 RBIs in 1043 games.\nDuring his career with the Red Sox, White was one of the players featured in the Norman Rockwell painting \"The Rookie\". He also opened a bowling alley, Sammy White's Brighton Bowl, a few miles from Fenway Park, and became a professional bowler. After baseball, White moved to Hanalei, Hawaii, where he became a professional golfer for the Princeville organization. He died in Princeville, Hawaii, at the age of 64.\nExternal links.\n, or Encyclopedia of MLB catchers"

        "text": "The Netball World Cup is a quadrennial international netball world championship organised by World Netball, inaugurated in 1963. Since its inception the competition has been dominated primarily by the Australia national netball team and the New Zealand national netball team, Trinidad and Tobago is the only other team to have won a title (a three-way tie in the 1979 championship). The most recent tournament was the 2023 Netball World Cup in Cape Town, South Africa, which was won by Australia.\nHistory.\nIn 1960, representatives from Australia, England, New Zealand, South Africa and the West Indies met to discuss standardising the rules of the sport. This led to the establishment of the International Federation of Women's Basketball and Netball (which later became the International Federation of Netball Associations). Formal rules were established at this inaugural meeting and a decision to hold World Championship tournaments every four years was also made. The first World Netball Championship was held in 1963 and was hosted by England. The tournament was renamed to the World Cup as opposed to \"Championships\" in 2015. Since 1991 the tournament has maintained a format allowing semi-finals and finals matches to be played, where previously the tournament held no finals and instead utilised the round-robin system, which occasionally led to more than one nation being crowned world champions.\nAustralia or New Zealand have won all of the titles, though emerging netball nations England, South Africa and Jamaica have come close to dislodging the top-tier nations on several occasions. In 1979 Australia, New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago were all joint champions. South Africa finished runners-up in 1995, England too in 2023. Jamaica have contested several bronze medal matches and come up short in narrow semi-final defeats. The reigning world champions are Australia, who defeated England in the 2023 final. They will defend their title in Sydney, Australia in 2027.\nResults.\nTournament history.\nSource: \nReferences.\nNetball Scoop - Team Lists (World Championships)"

        "title": "List of Test cricket hat-tricks",
        "text": "In the sport of cricket, a hat-trick is an occasion where a bowler takes three wickets in consecutive deliveries, dismissing three different batsmen. As of June 2021, this feat has only been achieved 46 times in more than two thousand Test matches, the form of the sport in which national representative teams compete in matches of up to five days' duration. The first Test hat-trick was recorded on 2 January 1879, in only the third Test match to take place, by the Australian pace bowler Fred Spofforth, nicknamed \"The Demon Bowler\", who dismissed three English batsmen with consecutive deliveries at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. The most recent hat-trick was taken by South Africa's spin bowler Keshav Maharaj against the West Indies in June 2021 at Daren Sammy Cricket Ground in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia.\nA player has taken two hat-tricks in the same Test match only once. Playing for Australia against South Africa in the first match of the 1912 Triangular Tournament at Old Trafford, Manchester, England, leg spinner Jimmy Matthews took a hat-trick in South Africa's first and second innings, both taken on 28 May 1912. He completed both hat-tricks by dismissing South Africa's Tommy Ward. Only three other cricketers have taken more than one Test hat-trick: Australian off spinner Hugh Trumble (two years apart, between the same teams at the same ground), Pakistani fast bowler Wasim Akram (just over a week apart, in consecutive matches between the same teams) and English fast bowler Stuart Broad. Three players have taken a hat-trick on their Test debut: English medium pace bowler Maurice Allom in 1930, New Zealand off-spinner Peter Petherick in 1976, and Australian pace bowler Damien Fleming in 1994. Alok Kapali took the fewest total Test wickets of any player who recorded a hat-trick, taking only six wickets in his entire Test career. Australian Peter Siddle is the only bowler to take a hat-trick on his birthday, and Bangladeshi off spinner Sohag Gazi is the only player to score a century and take a hat-trick in the same Test match.\nSri Lankan seamer Nuwan Zoysa became the first player in the history to take a hat-trick off the first three balls of a Test match. He achieved this against Zimbabwe at Harare in November 1999, dismissing Trevor Gripper, Murray Goodwin and Neil Johnson. Indian pacer Irfan Pathan is the second bowler to take a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match, against Pakistan in 2006.\nAustralian Merv Hughes is the only bowler to take a hat-trick where the wickets fell over three overs. This was at WACA, Perth in 1988. He took a wicket (Curtly Ambrose) with the final ball of an over. With the first ball of his next over he took the final wicket of the West Indies innings (Patrick Patterson). He then removed the opener Gordon Greenidge with the first ball of the West Indies second innings. Even more unusually, Hughes's two first-innings wickets were not consecutive, since Tim May had bowled an over himself in between Hughes's two deliveries, and took the wicket of Gus Logie.\nTwo other hat-tricks have taken place over two innings rather than one, both taken by West Indians against Australia—Courtney Walsh and Jermaine Lawson. Walsh's, at the Gabba in 1988, was unusual since, like Hughes' (which was in the very next Test in the series), other wickets fell between the beginning and end of the hat-trick. After dismissing Dodemaide to finish off Australia's first innings, Walsh did not open the bowling in the Australian second innings, and in fact did not bowl until Australia had already lost two wickets and were 65 for 2: then with his first two deliveries he dismissed Wood and Veletta. Lawson's hat trick was at the Kensington Oval in 2003. He removed tail-enders Lee and MacGill in successive deliveries before Australia declared their first innings (at 605–9), and then took the wicket of Langer with the first delivery of Australia's second innings.\nIn the five-match series between a Rest of the World XI and England in 1970, a hat-trick was taken by South African Eddie Barlow in the fourth match, at Headingley (the last three of four wickets in five balls). These matches were considered to be Tests at the time, but that status was later removed.\nBy team.\nEngland and Australia combined have taken over half of all Test match hat-tricks to date, 24 of 45 (53.33%)."

        "title": "Comparison of baseball and softball",
        "text": " \nA comparison of the differences between baseball and softball can be made as softball is directly descended from baseball. An observer of one game would find the other very similar, but there are several important rule differences.\nFastpitch softball is more popular in competitive leagues, especially at the college and international tournament levels, while slow pitch is more popular in recreational leagues where the relative skill levels of different players may vary widely. The different rules of slowpitch can be viewed as maintaining a competitive balance for less skilled players by eliminating certain strategies (e.g., base stealing and bunting) which require a high level of skill to counter. Additionally, recreational leagues may impose their own ground rules, either for competitive balance or to meet local constraints (e.g., a time limit may be imposed on a game to ensure multiple games can be played in one day).\nA regulation softball is significantly larger than a regulation baseball. A softball measures between 11.88 and 12.13 inches in circumference and weighs between 6.25 and 7.00 ounces; a baseball measures between 9.00 and 9.25 inches in circumference and weighs between 5.00 and 5.25 ounces."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball all-time leaders in home runs by pitchers",
        "text": "In baseball, a home run (HR) is typically a fair hit that passes over an outfield fence or into the stands at a distance from home plate of 250 feet or more, which entitles the batter to legally touch all bases and score without liability. Atypically, a batter who hits a fair ball and touches each base in succession from 1st to home, without an error being charged to a defensive player, is credited with an inside-the-park home run. If, during a play, defensive or fan interference is called, and the awarded bases allow the batter to cross home plate, the batter is credited with a home run.\nWes Ferrell once held the all-time Major League Baseball record for home runs hit while playing the position of pitcher. He hit 37 as a pitcher. Baseball Hall of Famers Bob Lemon and Warren Spahn are tied for second with 35 career home runs apiece. Red Ruffing, Earl Wilson, and Don Drysdale are the only other pitchers to hit at least 25 home runs. Jack Stivetts hit a total of 35 home runs in his playing career, 21 as a pitcher. Ferrell and Ruffing also rank among the top pitchers in batting average, hitting .280 and .269, respectively.\nAs of the 2023 season, Shohei Ohtani, holds the lead among all active pitchers. Madison Bumgarner, with 19 home runs, holds the lead among all active pitchers that exclusively do so. Bumgarner also has hit the second most home runs by a pitcher since the American League adopted the designated hitter rule in 1973 (behind Carlos Zambrano). Bumgarner has played most of his career thus far for the San Francisco Giants of the National League, and is currently playing for the Arizona Diamondbacks. Starting with the 2022 season, the National League also adopted the designated hitter rule, so most pitchers will no longer bat, except two-way players, such as Shohei Ohtani.\nFerrell, who had a career slash line of .280/.351/.446, had his best offensive year in 1931, when he set the single-season record for home runs by a pitcher with nine. The record had previously been held by Stivetts, who had hit seven in 1890. Since 1931, six different pitchers have hit seven home runs in a season: Ferrell, Lemon, Don Newcombe, Don Drysdale (twice), Wilson, and Mike Hampton.\nBabe Ruth started his major league career as a pitcher before moving to the outfield. Only 14 of his 714 career home runs were hit as a pitcher, however.\nThe first pitcher to officially hit a home run was Jack Manning, who accomplished the feat on August 3, 1876. The most home runs by a pitcher in a single game is three, achieved by Jim Tobin on May 13, 1942."

        "text": "Johnathan Richard Buck (born July 7, 1980) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Kansas City Royals, Toronto Blue Jays, Florida/Miami Marlins, New York Mets, Pittsburgh Pirates, Seattle Mariners and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. He went to high school in Taylorsville, Utah.\nCareer.\nHouston Astros.\nBuck was initially drafted by the Houston Astros in the 7th round of the 1998 Amateur Draft. He was signed to a minor league contract on June 11, 1998.\nBy 2002, Buck was highly regarded for his defensive ability, becoming one of the game's top minor league catchers and 68th top prospect in all of baseball. In 2003, Buck moved farther up prospect lists. He was listed as the 21st-best prospect in baseball by John Sickels.\nKansas City Royals.\nOn June 24, 2004, the Astros traded him to the Kansas City Royals as part of a three-way deal to acquire Carlos Beltrán, sending Buck and cash to Kansas City and Octavio Dotel to the Oakland Athletics. Mark Teahen and Mike Wood went from the Athletics to the Royals as well. The Royals immediately put Buck in their starting lineup, replacing injured veteran Benito Santiago. Buck made his major league debut on June 25. Although he initially appeared overmatched by major-league pitching—his batting average reached a low of .138 on July 7—he impressed the team with his defensive ability and his handling of pitchers. His hitting improved with time, and by September 25 he had raised his average to .243 with 12 home runs, and 30 RBIs.\nIn 2006, Buck fought with teammate Runelvys Hernández in the Royals dugout during a game against the Indians.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn December 16, 2009, Buck signed a one-year contract with the Toronto Blue Jays worth $2 million. On April 29, 2010. Buck hit 3 home runs in a single game against the Oakland Athletics. Buck was elected to the 2010 American League All-Star team on July 4, along with fellow Blue Jays Vernon Wells and José Bautista. In his first All-Star Game, he went 1–2 with a double. Buck finished his only season in Toronto with career-highs in batting average (.281), hits (115), home runs (20), RBI (66), doubles (25), slugging percentage (.489), and on-base plus slugging (.802).\nFlorida/Miami Marlins.\nBuck agreed to a three-year contract with the Florida Marlins worth $18 million on November 15, 2010. The deal was confirmed on November 17, 2010. In his first game with the Marlins, he hit a grand slam off New York Mets pitcher Mike Pelfrey.\nIn 2011, he had the lowest percentage of runners caught stealing of all major league catchers, at 17%.\nIn 2012, Buck hit .192/.297/.347 with 12 home runs and 41 RBI in 106 games while throwing out 27% of runners.\nNew York Mets.\nOn November 19, 2012, Buck was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Josh Johnson, José Reyes, Mark Buehrle, and Emilio Bonifacio, in exchange for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Álvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino. On December 17, 2012, the Blue Jays traded him, Noah Syndergaard, Travis d'Arnaud, and Wuilmer Becerra to the New York Mets for R. A. Dickey, Josh Thole, and Mike Nickeas.\nBuck began 2013 as the starting catcher, with Anthony Recker as his backup. After a great April in which he hit .241/.269/.575 with 9 home runs and 25 RBI, Buck cooled down some. On August 17, Buck was placed on paternity leave, and he was replaced on the roster by the catcher he was traded with, Travis d'Arnaud. d'Arnaud took the starting role when Buck returned, and Buck would soon be traded.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn August 27, 2013, Buck and Marlon Byrd were traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for infield prospect Dilson Herrera and a player to be named later, identified on August 29 as Vic Black. He finished the season as the backup to Russell Martin. In 110 games total (9 with Pittsburgh), he hit .219/.285/.362 with 15 home runs and 62 RBI.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn January 14, 2014, Buck agreed to a 1-year, $1 million deal with the Seattle Mariners. He was projected to split time at catcher with Humberto Quintero and Mike Zunino. On July 7, Buck's 34th birthday, the Mariners designated him for assignment. After clearing waivers unclaimed, Buck became a free agent.\nLos Angeles Angels of Anaheim.\nBuck was signed to a minor league contract by the Los Angeles Angels on July 21, 2014. He was assigned to the Triple-A Salt Lake Bees. The Angels designated Buck for assignment on October 7, 2014, after claiming Alfredo Marte and Roger Kieschnick on waivers. He rejected an assignment to Triple-A, becoming a free agent.\nRetirement.\nIn January 2015, Buck agreed to a minor league contract with the Atlanta Braves. The contract included an invitation to major-league spring training. Buck was expected to start the 2015 season at Triple-A. However, on March 26, he announced that he was retiring from baseball.\nPersonal life.\nBuck's wife Brooke gave birth to twins twelve weeks prematurely in May 2008. The twins' names are Cooper and Brody. In August 2013, his wife gave birth to their third son, Bentley.\nIn December 2011, Buck assisted in rescuing two elderly women from an overturned car in Sunrise, Florida."

He was selected by the Miami Dolphins 16th overall of the 2006 NFL draft. He played college football at Tennessee. Allen also played for the Houston Texans and Cincinnati Bengals.\nHigh school career.\nAllen earned various honors while playing football at Muscle Shoals High School in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was named an All-American from SuperPrep, PrepStar and Borderwars.com. He was twice a 5A All-State running back and was once selected as the Alabama Gatorade Player of the Year. As a senior, he ran for 1,740 yards and 21 touchdowns while adding 378 yards and three scores receiving. His performance earned him the honor of being the No. 1 player in Alabama by Birmingham News and Mobile Register.\nAllen also lettered in track and basketball at Muscle Shoals. He graduated early in January 2001.\nCollege career.\nAllen was a four-year letterman and three-year starter for the Tennessee Volunteers. He appeared in 43 games with 26 starting, including 12 starts at safety and 14 at cornerback.\n2002.\nBy graduating in January, Allen was able to attend spring practices at the University of Tennessee. He went on to play in 13 games as a true freshman in 2002, finishing with five tackles.\n2003.\nAs a starting cornerback in 2003, Allen started 8 of the 13 games in which he appeared, amassing 57 tackles (43 solo), a forced fumble, 2 interceptions, 11 passes defensed, and a blocked kick.

        "title": "Multi-pitch climbing",
        "text": "Multi-pitch climbing is a type of climbing that typically takes place on routes that are more than a single rope length (circa 50 to 70 metres) in height (or distance), and thus where the lead climber cannot complete the climb as a single pitch. Where the number of pitches exceeds 6–10 (300–500 metres), it can become big wall climbing, or where the pitches are in a mixed rock and ice mountain environment, it can become alpine climbing. Multi-pitch rock climbs can come in traditional, sport, and aid formats. Some have free soloed multi-pitch routes.\nMulti-pitch climbing is more complex and riskier than single-pitch climbing as the climbers will remain exposed on the route (e.g. a rock climbing route, an ice climbing, or a mixed climbing route) for longer, and it will often involve the use of hanging belays, long abseils, and the creation of belay anchors. Rescues from multi-pitch climbs are far more serious, and climbers will use additional protection to avoid this. Multi-pitch climbing requires greater communication between climbers; advanced climbers can use the riskier—but faster— simul climbing. \nDescription.\nMulti-pitch lead climbing involves ascending climbing routes that cannot be completed in a single pitch (which is typically a rope-length), usually due to their height but also due to routes that move in unusual directions (e.g. routes with a lot of traversing). Multi-pitch routes are most commonly traditional climbing routes (i.e. the leader inserts the climbing protection as they ascend), but there are also multi-pitch sport climbing routes (i.e. the climbing protection is pre-bolted into the route, or at least where important belay anchors are pre-bolted such as on El Capitan in Yosemite).\nMulti-pitch climbs are usually done in teams of pairs, and the position of leader can alternate between pitches or after a group of pitches (called \"block leading\") as long as both climbers have the skill and competence to lead on the route. Alternatively, one climber can lead all of the pitches while the other climber constantly belays them, and is then belayed themselves from the top by the lead climber on each pitch (see image left). Where both climbers are very comfortable on the terrain and want to move quickly, they can use simul climbing, although this is a more complex and riskier technique. \nIn addition to climbing in pairs, multi-pitch climbs can be done as solo climbs, either as free solo climbing (i.e. no protection used), or as rope solo climbing (i.e. a self-belying system used). \nThe boundary between multi-pitch climbing and big wall climbing or alpine climbing is not defined. Generally, multi-pitch routes that are \"at least\" 6–10 pitches or 300-500 metres in length, and mostly require hanging belays (i.e. due to the sheer nature of the route) are considered \"big wall routes\". Long multi-pitch climbs on mountains whose route is not continually on a sheer \"big wall\" face, are sometimes referred to as alpine rock climbing. Ice climbing and mixed climbing can also be done as multi-pitch climbing, or as part of an alpine climbing route.\nEquipment.\nMulti-pitch climbing requires all the equipment used in leading a single-pitch sport, traditional or ice climbing route, but with a few specific additions:\nTechniques.\nWhile many of the techniques of single-pitch lead climbing are common to multi-pitch climbing, there are specific techniques that are important to be able to execute well to safely ascend a multi-pitch climbing route:\nCompetition multi-pitch climbing.\nIn October 2022, the first competition climbing event in a multi-pitch format was hosted on an artificial climbing wall built on the Verzasca Dam in Switzerland as the 'Red Bull Dual Ascent'. Teams of climbing pairs faced off in head-to-head contests on identical side-by-side 6-pitch routes, with the winning team finishing the route in the fastest time. Unlimited falls were allowed as long as the lead climber returned to the base of the pitch (or penalty points were accepted instead). The first event was won by Alberto Ginés López and Luka Potočar. The October 2023 event was held in a mixed team format, with Jernej Kruder and his sister Julija Kruder taking first prize.\nGrading.\nMulti-pitch climbing routes are generally graded in the same way as their equivalent single-pitch sport route grading, traditional route grading, or ice route grading routes. Each pitch on a multi-pitch route will be separately graded so that, for example, a 3-pitch multi-sport climbing route might be graded as French sport: 7c, 7b, 8a; or a 5-pitch multi-traditional climbing route might be graded as American YDS: 5.10a, 5.10b, 5.10a, 5.11c, 5.9. Harder or easier options on individual pitches will also be highlighted and separately graded, so that, for example, a pitch might be graded as French sport: 7c \"avoidable\" or \"max\" (you don't have to do the 7c part) / 7a \"obligatory\" or \"obj\" (you will have to do at least 7a graded climbing). \nSometimes an \"overall\" grade is quoted for a multi-pitch route (in addition to the grades of individual pitches), however, this is usually the grade of the hardest pitch on the route (e.g. see \"Yeah Man\" image opposite). \nIn common with big wall grading, where there are very difficult sections of individual pitches that are well above the general level of difficulty of the overall route (i.e. a common feature of bigger walls as it is harder to find big routes of a consistent difficulty level), an aid climbing option might be highlighted, which will have an attached aid climbing grade, for example, an individual pitch on a multi-traditional climbing route might be graded as: 5.10a (with no aid) or 5.7 A2 (with aid), and the type of aid needed also explained.\nIn film.\nA number of notable films have been made focused on multi-pitch (and big wall climbing) including: "

        "text": "Robert Richard Boyd (October 1, 1919 – September 7, 2004) was an American first baseman in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball.\nCareer.\nNicknamed \"Rope\" for his line-drive hitting, Boyd served in the US Army during World War II, and played in the Negro leagues with the Memphis Red Sox (1947–49), and in the major leagues for the Chicago White Sox (1951, 1953–54), Baltimore Orioles (1956–60), Kansas City Athletics (1961) and Milwaukee Braves (1961).\nThe , Boyd threw and batted left-handed, and he could shine with his glove. He was a contact hitter, slight of frame, and did not produce the kind of home run power expected from a major league first baseman. He started his professional career in the Negro leagues with the Memphis Red Sox, and played three seasons for them between 1947 and 1949, batting .352, .369 and .371, respectively.\nIn 1950, Boyd became the first black player to sign with the Chicago White Sox. He made his debut on September 8, 1951. Basically a backup player and pinch-hitter with the Sox, in 1954 he was sent to the St. Louis Cardinals, but did not play for them, spending 1954 and 1955 with Houston in the Double-A Texas League and hitting .321 and .310. At the end of the 1955 season, he was drafted by the Baltimore Orioles from St. Louis in the Rule 5 draft. In 1956 with the Orioles, he hit .311 with two homers and 11 RBI in 70 games.\nBoyd enjoyed a career season in 1957. Only eight batters reached the .300 mark in the American League, and he finished fourth in the batting race with a .318 average behind Ted Williams (.388), Mickey Mantle (.365) and Gene Woodling (.321), and over Nellie Fox, Minnie Miñoso, Bill Skowron and Roy Sievers. Beside this, Boyd became the first Oriole regular in the 20th century to hit over .300 in batting average. The following year, he batted .309 with a career-high seven home runs.\nBoyd ended his majors career in 1961. He compiled a .293 batting average with 19 home runs and 175 RBI in 693 games. Thanks to his discipline at the plate and knowledge of the strike zone, he registered an outstanding 1.465 walk-to-strikeout ratio (167-to-114). At first base, he committed only 36 errors in 4159 chances for a .991 fielding average.\nBob Boyd died at age 84 in Wichita, Kansas. He is a member both of the Negro League Hall of Fame and of the National Baseball Congress Hall of Fame. His nephew Dennis \"Oil Can\" Boyd pitched for three MLB teams, most notably the Boston Red Sox, between 1982 and 1991.\nExternal links.\n and Seamheads "

        "title": "Baseball (TV series)",
        "text": "Baseball is a 1994 American television documentary miniseries created by documentary filmmaker Ken Burns about the history of the sport of baseball. \nFirst broadcast on PBS, this was Burns' ninth documentary and won the 1995 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Informational Series. It was funded in part by the National Endowment for the Humanities.\nFormat.\n\"Baseball\", like Burns' previous documentaries such as \"The Civil War\", used archived pictures and film footage mixed with interviews for visual presentation. Actors provide voice over reciting written work (letters, speeches, etc.) over pictures and video. Episodes are interspersed with the music of the times taken from previous Burns series, original played music, or recordings ranging from Louis Armstrong to Elvis Presley. John Chancellor, anchor of the \"NBC Nightly News\" from 1970 to 1982, narrated the series.\nThe documentary is divided into nine parts, each referred to as an \"inning\", following the division of a baseball game. Each \"inning\" reviews an era, mentioning notable moments in the world and in America itself, and begins with a brief prologue acting as an insight to the game during that era. The prologue ends with the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" just as a real baseball game would begin, being performed usually by a brass band, with a couple of exceptions: The 1920s, where the rendition is played by a piano of the era, and the 1960s, where the rendition is the version played by Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. In some \"inning\" episodes, a period version of the baseball anthem \"Take Me Out to the Ball Game\" is used. Roughly halfway through each \"inning\", a title card appears, reading \"Bottom of\" the inning, dividing the episode into two parts in a manner also recalling the game; in the seventh \"inning\", the \"Bottom\" is immediately preceded by the \"seventh-inning stretch\". Within these halves of the episode, there are smaller segments also highlighted with a simple title card that often highlights various important parts of baseball's history. These often include player highlights, important or eventful games, or the creation of various brands that are now well known throughout baseball such as Louisville Slugger.\nThe Nine Innings.\nOriginal airdate: Sunday, September 18, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Monday, September 19, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday, September 20, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Wednesday, September 21, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Thursday, September 22, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Sunday, September 25, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Monday, September 26, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday, September 27, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Wednesday, September 28, 1994.\nOriginal airdate: Tuesday, September 28, 2010.\nOriginal airdate: Wednesday, September 29, 2010.\nInterview subjects.\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of people not involved in baseball who were interviewed in the documentary:\nThe following is a non-exhaustive list of people who were more involved in the game of baseball, and were interviewed in the documentary:\nVoices.\nThe following provided voice-over readings in \"Baseball\":\nReception.\nCritics and audiences praised the series but criticized its length and detail. At 18.5 hours, the runtime of the series is one of Burns' longest.\nThe first episode more than doubled PBS's average primetime ratings with a Nielsen rating of 5.1 and an audience share of 7% but did not do as well as \"Civil War\" 9 rating and 13% share.\n\"The Tenth Inning\".\nAt a preview screening of his 2007 documentary \"The War\", Ken Burns spoke of the possibility of coming up to date in the history of baseball with a \"Tenth Inning\" episode of his \"Baseball\" documentary. This was officially confirmed by Burns in an MLB Network interview, and later to the NBC LA web site during the winter Television Critics Association media tour January 8. It aired in Fall 2010 and covered the period from 1992 through the 2009 season.\nDuring in-game coverage of a Texas Rangers game during July 2009, Burns was interviewed, and said \"The Tenth Inning\" would air \"about a year from now\" on PBS. He also stated that it would be two two-hour programs. One would be the \"top of the 10th\", and the other would be the \"bottom of the 10th\". He also said that \"the good Lord willing\", there would be an 11th Inning and a 12th Inning in the future. His aim was to air the 11th Inning in 2020 opening with Armando Galarraga. Burns also said that \"Baseball\" is the only one of his documentaries to which he was ever interested in doing a \"sequel\" (of sorts).\n\"The Tenth Inning\" premiered on PBS on September 28, 2010, narrated by Keith David. The Inning was broken into two halves airing on September 28 and 29, 2010. The documentary discussed the major stories that covered the period from 1992 through the 2009 season. It focuses heavily on examining the Steroid era and the many players who got caught up in it, but also discusses other major issues in baseball, such as how baseball rebounded from the 1994 strike largely thanks to the selflessness of Cal Ripken Jr. and other players, the return to prominence of the Yankees, the influence of international players (specifically Dominican and Japanese players) on the game, and the drama of the 2003 and 2004 American League Championship Series, which helped baseball, even in the midst of America's greatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, become as popular as it has ever been.\nCritical reception.\nDavid Hinckley of \"New York Daily News\" wrote, \"Ken Burns hits another one out of the park.\""

        "text": "Ice hockey was introduced to the Olympic Games at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp. The tournament also served as the first World Championships. The matches were played between April 23 and April 29, 1920. Canada, represented by the Winnipeg Falcons, won the gold medal. The silver went to the United States and Czechoslovakia took the bronze.\nSummary.\nThe organizing committee for the hockey matches included Paul Loicq, the captain of the Belgian team and a future president of the Ligue Internationale de Hockey sur Glace (LIHG). The games used the Canadian ice hockey rules, and the Bergvall system to determine medal winning teams.\nThe Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) chose the Winnipeg Falcons as the 1920 Allan Cup champions to represent the Canada men's national team, instead of forming a national all-star team on short notice. Canada's manager W. A. Hewitt, introduced the CAHA rules of play to the LIHG at the Olympics. Writer Andrew Podnieks described Hewitt's interpretation of the rules as \"competitive yet gentlemanly\", and that the rules of play were accepted for Olympic hockey. Hewitt refereed the first Olympic hockey game played, an 8–0 win by the Sweden men's national team versus the Belgium men's national team, on April 23, 1920.\nAll matches took place in the Palais de Glace d'Anvers (ice palace of Antwerp). The rink was smaller than North American standards, measuring long by wide. All games were played with seven players per side, with the rover position being used. For the duration of each match no substitutions were permitted and if a player exited the game due to injury the opposing team was forced to take a player out as well. Additional differences from modern play included a prohibition on forward passing and the requirement that all players including the goaltender be standing on his skates to play the puck. The duration of each game was two periods of twenty minutes each. Any game tied at the end of forty minutes would be extended by two periods of five minutes each, not sudden death. If tied at the end of fifty minutes, this process would repeat—and repeat as many times as needed until a winner is declared.\nThis was the first ice hockey tournament at an Olympic Games, and the only ever instance of it at a Summer Olympics. An ice hockey tournament was part of the inaugural Winter Olympics in 1924 and has been part of every Winter program since then.\nParticipating nations.\nA total of 60 ice hockey players from 7 nations competed at the Antwerp Games:\nFormat.\nSeven nations entered teams in the inaugural Olympic ice hockey tournament. The tournament format used the Bergvall system, starting with an elimination round to determine the gold medal winner, after which teams that lost to the tournament winner would play through a new bracket to determine silver. Finally, teams which lost to either the gold or silver winners would face off in a third bracket to determine the bronze winner. For the gold medal round, teams were drawn into the bracket with France receiving a bye to the semifinals.\nAt the time of draw, the Swedish team questioned how the matchups for the later rounds would be determined and it was believed that teams advancing further in the earlier round would receive a bye. However, no decision was made and when it came time for the silver medal round Sweden and the United States were selected to play a semifinal game while Czechoslovakia received the bye. Later for the bronze medal round, organizers wanted to ensure the tournament would conclude on schedule but were reluctant to force the Czechoslovakians to play twice in one day. As a result, the Swedish team were made to play another semifinal game which would be their fourth in as many days with the bronze medal game the following day. This led to criticism of the format despite Bergvall later noting that the system was not used correctly.\nStatistics.\nAverage age.\nTeam France was the oldest team in the tournament, averaging 32 years and 11 months. Gold medalists team Canada was the youngest team in the tournament, averaging 24 years and 5 months. Tournament average was 26 years and 9 months."

        "title": "International Baseball Federation",
        "text": "The International Baseball Federation (IBAF) is the former worldwide governing body of baseball. It has since been superseded by the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), and continues to exist as the WBSC's baseball division. Between 1944 and 1975, it was known by its Spanish-language name, as the Federación Internacional de Béisbol Amateur, or FIBA.\nPrior to the establishment of the WBSC, the IBAF was the sole entity recognized by the International Olympic Committee as overseeing the sport, and as the designated organizer and promoter of major international tournaments like the Baseball World Cup (originally the Amateur World Series) and the Intercontinental Cup. It also organized the inaugural World Baseball Classic (WBC), in cooperation with Major League Baseball, in 2006.\nOne of its principal responsibilities as the WBSC's umbrella is to organize, standardize and sanction international competitions, using the WBSC name, among baseball's 124 national governing bodies through its various tournaments to determine a world champion and calculate world rankings for both men's and women's baseball. Its offices are housed within the WBSC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland—the Olympic Capital.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe first-ever international baseball event was a series of exhibition games that took place during the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, United States. The exhibition proved so successful that it was given an encore at the 1912 Summer Olympics in Stockholm, Sweden.\nThe two popular showings in St. Louis and Stockholm laid the groundwork for baseball's international surge in popularity, leading the sport to be placed onto the program as an exhibition sport at the 1936 Summer Olympics. This exhibition was extremely well received as 92,565 spectators filled the Olympic Stadium in Berlin to watch a game between two teams from the US.\nFollowing the success of Berlin, the first ever Baseball World Cup was organized in London, England, in August 1938. The United States and Great Britain engaged in five games, of which the British won four.\nThe growth of baseball competitions involving the representation of countries, coupled with the birth of the Baseball World Cup, provided the need for an institution to help develop, organize, regulate and oversee these events, thus the International Baseball Federation was established in 1938. It was initially headquartered in the offices of Orange Bowl Stadium in Miami, Florida.\nEarly years and FIBA.\nConflicts of World War II prompted the IOC to cancel the Summer Games that had been scheduled to take place in Tokyo in 1940 and in London in 1944, thereby halting baseball's tour as a demonstration sport. Nevertheless, by 1950, FIBA was able to expand the format of the Baseball World Cup that was contested in Managua, Nicaragua, to 12 participating countries.\nIn 1951, the Pan American Games were established and baseball was on the official program from the onset. In April 1953, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Spain came together to establish what is now known as the Confederation of European Baseball and organized the first ever European Baseball Championship a year later.\nThe Baseball Federation of Asia (BFA) was founded in May 1954 as the second continental confederation under the umbrella of FIBA. The BFA wasted little time in organizing its first continental tournament, as it celebrated the Asian Baseball Championship in December of that same year in Manila, Philippines.\nThe exposure of baseball to an international audience continued at the 1956 Summer Olympics, which saw approximately 114,000 spectators slowly fill the Melbourne Cricket Ground to witness Australia vs. US in a demonstration contest in Melbourne, Australia. This crowd of 114,000 was registered as a Guinness World Record for the largest attendance for any single baseball game. (The record lasted over 50 years before it was broken at a March 29, 2008 Major League Baseball exhibition game between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers that drew 115,300 people to the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.)\nBaseball as an Olympic demonstration sport was finally able to take its act to Asia at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, where baseball was already exceptionally popular. Following the 1968 Summer Olympics, a selection of premier U.S. college players defeated the Cuba national team twice in Mexico City to win the International Amateur Baseball Tournament (though it was not officially a demonstration sport).\nJuan Isa expanded FIBA's reach to include Europe, inviting the Netherlands and Italy to the Amateur World Series for the first time in 1970.\nFEMBA split.\nIsa's tenure as president was controversial. Some federations felt that power had been concentrated in the hands of the Latin American federations for too long, to the detriment of federations in Europe and North America. Tensions came to a head at the 1973 FIBA Congress, where the Congress suspended Nicaragua and awarded the 1973 Amateur World Series to Cuba; Isa also refused to call for new elections. As a result, \nNicaraguan, Italian, and U.S. officials withdrew from FIBA, and instead formed formed the Federación Mundial de Béisbol Amateur (World Amateur Baseball Federation), also knowns as FEMBA. \nOther countries to join FEMBA included Argentina, Canada, Taiwan, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and South Africa. William \"Dutch\" Fehring was elected president, and Carlos García Solórzano vice president. The Caribbean federations — Venezuela, Panama, Puerto Rico, Mexico, Cuba, and the Dutch Antilles — remained with FIBA. The Baseball Federation of Cuba characterized the division as driven by Cold War political tensions. However, this was denied by Roger Panaye, president of the European Amateur Baseball Confederation (CEBA):\nUnder FEMBA, the first Intercontinental Cup was organized in 1973; another would follow in 1975. FEMBA also organized its own 1973 Amateur World Series in Nicaragua, to compete with the one being held by FIBA in Cuba.\nFehring, with the backing of MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, pushed International Olympic Committee head Lord Killanin to include baseball at the Olympics. However, Killanin told him it would not occur as long as baseball was represented by two different organizations.\nThe FEMBA-FIBA split was resolved in 1976 thanks to the mediation of Mexican Olympic Committee president Mario Vázquez Raña; FIBA was reorganized as AINBA (), with Manuel González Guerra elected president and Carlos García Solórzano vice president.\nBaseball at the Summer Olympics.\nIn 1978, the IOC awarded the hosting rights of the 1984 Summer Olympics to Los Angeles, and Robert Smith quickly went to work, in his capacity as a member of the United States Olympic Committee, to reestablish baseball as part of the Olympic Programme. Smith reached out to the then-Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Peter O'Malley, and University of Southern California head baseball coach and subsequent College Baseball Hall of Fame inductee, Rod Dedeaux. The group organized an IBAF congress the following year in Los Angeles in order to establish an Olympic Baseball Committee. Through these efforts, baseball was again categorized as a demonstration sport and an eight-team tournament was organized at Dodger Stadium, as part of the official Summer Olympic Programme. The present IBAF President, Riccardo Fraccari, was the head umpire of the championship game.\nA third branch of the IBAF continental confederations formed in 1985. The Pan American Baseball Confederation (COPABE) was finally established after it was deemed necessary due to the strong expansion and increase of the national member federations stemming from the Olympic Baseball Committee campaign. \nIn 1986, a historic IOC vote put baseball onto the Olympic Programme as a medal sport for the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain. Baseball would travel to Seoul, Korea, for the 1988 Summer Olympics. This was the final time the IBAF, in conjunction with the IOC, would organize baseball as a demonstration (not medal) sport at the Olympics.\nIn 1989, the Baseball Confederation of Oceania (BCO) was established as the 4th branch of the IBAF. The African Baseball and Softball Association (ABSA) was formed in Lagos, Nigeria soon after, in June 1990.\nBaseball was played up in a traditional amateur format up until the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. In 1998, the IBAF, MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association reached an agreement to allow the participation of professional players in international competition. The United States used a minor league selection to beat Cuba in the gold medal game at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Cuba regained the world title, defeating Australia for the gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.\nSetbacks and reformation.\nOn July 7, 2005, the IOC Session voted to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics program. Baseball made its last Olympic appearance and Korea took the gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics.\nThe IBAF, under President Harvey Schiller, attempted to reinstate baseball onto the Olympic Programme, but the IOC vote of August 2009 kept baseball off the 2016 program, as golf and rugby were selected.\nIn February 2011, Dr. Harvey Schiller was appointed as a member of the IOC's Women and Sport Commission.\nOn April 1, 2011, the IBAF, under first-year President Riccardo Fraccari, and the International Softball Federation announced that they were studying how to prepare a joint proposal in order to revive play of both sports at the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nAs part of that proposal, in April 2013, the two organizations began the process of merging into a new combined federation that will govern both sports, the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC).\nThe merging was concluded in 2015, and WBSC managed to obtain the bid for 2020 Games on following months.\nInternational events.\nThe International Baseball Federation organized the following world championship tournaments before WBSC merger:\nThe first-ever 12U Baseball World Championship was played in Taipei from July 8 to 17, 2011. Taiwan won the first title.\nIn addition, the IBAF is the sanctioning body for the World Baseball Classic, which is hosted by Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association and held every four years in the year after the Summer Olympics. The IBAF abandoned its former world championship, the Baseball World Cup, after the 2011 edition in favor of an expanded World Baseball Classic. It was originally intended to be the sanctioning body for the Premier 12, a new men's international tournament – featuring the twelve best-ranked national teams – that began in 2015; that tournament instead has been sanctioned by the WBSC. This event is played in the year preceding the Summer Olympics.\nThe IBAF discontinued the Intercontinental Cup, which was an invitational event and last held in 2010.\nOrganizational structure.\nThe IBAF comprises five continental confederations that currently represent a total of 127 national member federations.\nPresidents.\n(*) Aldo Notari died during the period as the president, thus the first vice president, Tom Peng of Taiwan, served as acting president from July 2006 to 2007.\nAwards.\nSee also: Baseball awards of the International Baseball Fedederation (IBAF)"

        "title": "Roger Craig (American football)",
        "text": "Roger Timothy Craig (born July 10, 1960) is an American former football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL). He played for the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Raiders and Minnesota Vikings. Craig went to four Pro Bowls and won three Super Bowls with the 49ers. Craig was the first NFL player to have 1,000 yards rushing and receiving in the same season. Marshall Faulk and Christian McCaffrey are the only other players to have accomplished that feat. He currently works as the VP of Business Development at TIBCO Software.\nEarly life.\nCraig attended Central High School in Davenport, Iowa, graduating in 1979. There, he was teammates with future NFL TE Jamie Williams. His older brother, Curtis Craig, had also played running back, graduating from Central in 1974. The Craig brothers were preceded at running back for Central by future Denver Broncos RB Jim Jensen. The 1976 team, with Roger Craig and Williams, won the Iowa State Championship under Coach Jim Fox. In 1978, his Senior year, Craig rushed for 1,565 yards and 27 touchdowns, earning prep All-America honors. In his final high school game, a playoff loss, Craig rushed for 353 yards and 4 touchdowns. \nCraig was an all-around athlete, also competing in wrestling and track. In wrestling, he was an Iowa State Championships qualifier. On the track, Craig finished 2nd in the Iowa State Track and Field Championships in both the 110 hurdles and the 400 hurdles as a Senior in 1979. Craig broke the school record in the 110 hurdles that had been set by Jim Jensen. Craig credited 10-time State Champion Coach Ira Dunsworth with helping develop his distinctive high knee running form. Craig's time of 14.43 in the 110 hurdles is still listed among the All-Time Bests at the Iowa State Track and Field Championships.\nCollege career.\nCraig followed in the footsteps of Curtis Craig and Jamie Williams to graduate from Davenport Central and then attend Nebraska to play for Coach Tom Osborne. Williams went on to an NFL career as well and Curtis Craig was an All-Big 8 Player in 1977.\nRoger Craig played three full seasons for the University of Nebraska. In his Nebraska career, he rushed for 2,446 yards and 26 touchdowns, with an average of 6 yards per carry. He was an integral running back in Osborne's I-formation option offense.\nAfter playing mainly for the Freshman squad in 1979, Craig rushed for 769 yards (7.1) and 15 TDs as a Sophomore in 1980. As a Junior in 1981, Craig gained 1,060 yards on 173 carries (6.1) and six TDs. Craig was also fourth on the team with 12 receptions for 87 yards and was named to the All-Big 8 Team. In 1982, teaming with Mike Rozier in the backfield, Craig was injured early in the season and lost playing time while injured, but came back with 127-yards rushing in the regular-season final game.\nTeammates of Craig during his tenure at Nebraska include QBs Jeff Quinn and Turner Gill; RBs Jarvis Redwine, I.M. Hipp, Andra Franklin, Craig Johnson, Jeff Smith and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Mike Rozier; T Dean Steinkuhler (#2 overall pick in 1984 NFL Draft); WR Irving Fryar (#1 overall pick in 1984 NFL Draft) and his hometown friend, TE Jamie Williams. Craig also ran one season of indoor track at Nebraska, finishing 4th in the 60 Meter hurdles at the Big 8 Indoor Championships.\nProfessional career.\nSan Francisco 49ers.\nCraig was the 49th overall selection in the 1983 NFL draft, taken by the San Francisco 49ers in the second round from Nebraska, where he once held the record for longest run from scrimmage (94 yards, set during a 1981 game against Florida State University).\nIn his rookie year in 1983 playing under Bill Walsh and alongside Quarterback Joe Montana, Craig scored a combined 12 touchdowns rushing and receiving, as the 49ers reached the NFC Championship game. Montana, Craig and Walsh would remain together until the 1988 season. Craig first became well known in his rookie year for his distinctive high-knee running technique. He is featured in the Dire Straits 'Walk of Life' video at the 3:13 mark.\nIn Super Bowl XIX in January 1985, Craig rushed for 58 yards, caught seven passes for 77 yards, and became the first player ever to score three touchdowns in a Super Bowl during the 49ers' 38–16 victory over the Miami Dolphins.\nThe following season, Craig became the first in NFL history to run and receive for at least 1,000 yards in the same season. He ran for 1,050 yards on 214 carries and led the NFL with 92 catches for 1,016 yards, and scored a team high 15 touchdowns. With fullback Tom Rathman, also from Nebraska, the two formed the 49ers' \"Cornfield Backfield.\"\nIn 1988, Craig was named NFL Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press. He ran for a career-high 1,502 yards and caught an additional 76 passes for 534 yards. A memorable game occurred in week 7 against the Los Angeles Rams. He scored three rushing touchdowns and ran a career-high 191 yards. He went on to assist the 49ers to Super Bowl XXIII by amassing 262 combined rushing and receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In the 49ers' 20–16 win over Cincinnati in that Super Bowl, he rushed for 71 yards and caught eight passes for 101 yards, making him the first running back have to have 100 receiving yards in a Super Bowl.\nIn the 1989 season, the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl for the second year in a row, aided by Craig's 1,527 combined rushing/receiving yards and seven touchdowns in the season, along with his 240 combined rushing/receiving yards and two touchdowns in their two playoff games. In San Francisco's 55–10 win over the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXIV, Craig rushed for 69 yards, caught five passes for 34 yards, and scored a touchdown.\nThe 49ers were 14–2 in the following regular season on their quest to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls. In the NFC Championship Game (his last as a 49er), a hit by Giants Nose Tackle Erik Howard caused Craig to fumble the football that was recovered by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor late in the fourth quarter while the 49ers were trying to hold on to a 13–12 lead over the New York Giants. Subsequent to the fumble recovery the Giants scored on a last-second field goal to win 15–13, and went on to win Super Bowl XXV.\nIn eight seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, Craig played in 121 games and missed only seven games, five of them in his final season. Playing alongside Dwight Clark, Jerry Rice, Tom Rathman, Russ Francis and others in the 49ers diverse offense, Craig accounted for 11,506 yards from scrimmage, rushing for 7064 yards (4.2) and 50 touchdowns, and catching 508 passes for 4442 yards (8.7) and 16 touchdowns. In 16 playoff games with the 49ers, Craig had 817 yards rushing (4.0) with seven touchdowns and 63 receptions for 606 yards (9.7) and two touchdowns, as the 49ers won three Super Bowls.\nLos Angeles Raiders.\nCraig left San Francisco and signed with the Los Angeles Raiders in 1991. Sharing time with Marcus Allen and Nick Bell, Craig led the Raiders in rushing as he rushed for 590 yards and had 17 receptions for 136 yards. The Raiders finished 9–7 under head coach Art Shell and lost to the Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs.\nMinnesota Vikings.\nCraig played his final two seasons with the Minnesota Vikings. Playing behind Terry Allen in 1992, Craig rushed for 416 yards and four touchdowns and caught 22 passes for 161 yards. The Vikings finished 11–5, winning the NFC Central Division and were defeated by the Washington Redskins in the playoffs.\nIn his final season, Craig split time with Barry Word, Scottie Graham and Robert Smith, as the Vikings finished 9–7, losing to the New York Giants in the playoffs. Craig rushed for 119 yards and 1 touchdown, catching 19 passes for 169 yards and 1 touchdown. Craig announced his retirement after the 1993 season, signing a one-day contract with the 49ers so he could retire as a 49er.\nLegacy.\nCraig appeared in the NFL Playoffs every year of his career, and made the Pro Bowl four times (1985, 1987–1989). Craig finished his eleven NFL seasons with 8,189 rushing yards, 566 receptions for 4,911 receiving yards, and three kickoff returns for 43 yards. Overall, he amassed 13,143 total yards and scored 73 touchdowns (56 rushing and 17 receiving).\nCraig was the first running back to gain more than 1,000 yards rushing and 1,000 yards receiving in the same season (1985). Since then, only two other running backs have achieved the same feat (Marshall Faulk in 1999, and Christian McCaffrey in 2019). Craig also caught a then-record 92 passes in the 1985 campaign. In 1988, Craig set a then-franchise record 1,502 yards rushing (Garrison Hearst broke the record with 1,570 yards in 1998. Frank Gore holds the current record with 1,695 yards in 2006). The 1988 season was the second time Craig broke the 2,000 combined yardage mark in his career.\nCraig, Lydell Mitchell and Chuck Foreman are the only running backs to lead the NFL in receptions for a single season.\nCraig is one of three running backs to ever record 100 receiving yards or more in a Super Bowl (James White, New England Patriots, Super Bowl 51; Corey Clement, Philadelphia Eagles, Super Bowl 52). His prowess as a receiver out of the backfield is a contrast to his college career, where he caught only 16 passes during his three seasons at Nebraska.\nIn 1993, Peter King (in Inside the Helmet) reported that Craig was the only running back to be elected to the Pro Bowl at both fullback and halfback.\nDespite his accomplishments as a football player, as of 2023, Craig has not been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. His inclusion (or lack thereof) has become a topic of controversy; while some cite Craig's impressive statistics and records, others argue that his success was bolstered by the production of Hall of Fame teammates Joe Montana and Jerry Rice.\nPersonal life.\nCraig spent several years studying Tae Kwon Do under Chris Jensen and Debbie Pederson at Golden State Tae Kwon Do in Foster City (now in San Carlos).\nHe is an avid runner and has participated in over 38 marathons and half-marathons.\nCraig was the Grand Marshal for the Toyota/Save Mart 350 at Infineon Raceway.\nCraig is the cousin of New York Jets running back Breece Hall.\nCraig married boxer Michael Nunn's sister."

        "title": "Joe Johnson (basketball)",
        "text": "Joe Marcus Johnson (born June 29, 1981) is an American former professional basketball player. Nicknamed \"Iso Joe\", he played high school basketball for Little Rock Central High School and college basketball for the Arkansas Razorbacks. After two years with Arkansas, he declared for the 2001 NBA draft where he was drafted 10th overall by the Boston Celtics.\nJohnson is a seven-time NBA All-Star and has also played for the Phoenix Suns, Atlanta Hawks, Brooklyn Nets, Miami Heat, Utah Jazz and Houston Rockets, while having also represented the United States national team. While playing for the Hawks, he earned the nickname \"Iso Joe\" for his skills on isolation plays. He is one of 50 NBA players to score 20,000 career points.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Little Rock, Arkansas, Johnson was a member of the William E. Thrasher Boys &amp; Girls Club as a youngster and attended Little Rock Central High School, a school that had produced other athletes including Baseball Hall of Famers Brooks Robinson and Bill Dickey, as well as football player Fred Williams and collegiate football coach Houston Nutt. His senior season at Central, Johnson led the Tigers to their 18th state championship and was named Arkansas Mr. Basketball.\nCollege career.\nIn his freshman season at Arkansas in 1999–2000, Johnson was named to the SEC All-Freshman team and SEC All-Tournament team after averaging 16.0 points, 5.7 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 2.0 steals per game. Johnson led Arkansas to the 2000 SEC men's basketball tournament championship.\nIn his sophomore season in 2000–01, Johnson was named to the All-SEC second team and SEC All-Tournament team, while also receiving honorable mention All-American honors. In 30 games, he averaged 14.2 points, 6.4 rebounds, 2.6 assists and 1.4 steals per game.\nProfessional career.\nBoston Celtics (2001–2002).\nFollowing his sophomore season at Arkansas, Johnson declared for the 2001 NBA draft where he went on to be selected with the 10th overall pick by the Boston Celtics. Through the first half of the 2001–02 season, Johnson played 48 games for the Celtics and made 33 starts, as he averaged 6.3 points, 2.9 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game. He was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on February 20, 2002 along with Randy Brown, Milt Palacio and a first-round pick in exchange for Rodney Rogers and Tony Delk.\nPhoenix Suns (2002–2005).\nJohnson became a force with Phoenix as he averaged 14.0 points per game in his three and a half seasons with the Suns, becoming a clutch three-point shooter as he averaged 39.3% from the three-point arc during his tenure with the Suns.\nDuring the 2004–05 campaign, Johnson and the Suns posted a 62–20 record. Johnson's three point accuracy improved dramatically between 2004 and 2005, shooting 30.5% on threes in 2004 and 47.8% in 2005, and shooting .556 in the 2005 playoffs. In the 2005 NBA playoffs, Johnson required surgery to repair a left orbital bone fracture sustained following a dunk attempt against the Dallas Mavericks in the second round. Johnson missed the remainder of the series against the Mavericks as well as the first two games of the Western Conference Finals against the San Antonio Spurs. When he returned, Johnson wore a face mask for protection. The Suns fell to the eventual NBA champion Spurs, 4 games to 1.\nAtlanta Hawks (2005–2012).\nIn the summer of 2005, Johnson became a highly touted restricted free agent and expressed a desire to leave the Suns to assume a larger role on the Atlanta Hawks. Johnson grew upset with Phoenix's initial offers to re-sign him feeling they were well below his market value. This rift eventually led to Johnson requesting the Suns not match Atlanta's $70 million offer. On August 19, 2005, a deal was finalized and Johnson was involved in a sign-and-trade deal with the Hawks for future teammate Boris Diaw and two future first-round draft picks.\nIn his first season as a Hawk, Johnson led Atlanta in several categories: points (20.2 per game), assists (6.5), steals (1.26), three-point field goals made (128) and minutes (40.7). He was one of only five players in the league to average at least 20 points and six assists in the 2005–06 season, along with Allen Iverson, Dwyane Wade, LeBron James and Gilbert Arenas. Johnson was also the only Hawk to play in all 82 games in 2005–06.\nJohnson scored a career-high 42 points on March 7, 2006 against the Golden State Warriors and recorded a career-high 17 assists on March 13, 2006 against the Milwaukee Bucks. He recorded his first career triple-double on February 1, 2006 with 15 points, 10 rebounds and 11 assists against the Charlotte Bobcats.\nJohnson continued his development in the 2006–07 season, when he averaged 25.0 points, 4.4 assists, 4.2 rebounds and 1.1 steals per game. His scoring average ranked ninth in the league. Johnson also shot a career-best 47.1% from the field and was subsequently named to the 2007 Eastern Conference All-Star team, replacing the injured Jason Kidd.\nIn 2008, Johnson made the 2008 All-Star Game as a reserve. He also was named Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice during the season. Johnson averaged 21.7 points per game on the season, leading the Hawks to their first playoff appearance in nine years. In Game 4 of the Hawks' first-round matchup against the Boston Celtics, Johnson scored 35 points, including 20 in the 4th quarter, leading the Hawks to a 97–92 victory.\nDespite finishing with the worst record (37–45) among the 2008 NBA Playoffs contingent, the Hawks played very even with the heavily favored and eventual NBA champion Boston Celtics, taking the Eastern Conference No. 1 seed all the way to Game 7. The year marked a turning of the page for the Atlanta franchise, once considered among the least successful in pro sports.\nThe following year, Johnson registered his second career triple-double on December 23, 2008 in a Hawks win against the Oklahoma City Thunder, with 20 points, 11 rebounds and 11 assists. He eclipsed the 10,000-point plateau for his career with his first basket during a 110–107 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on January 31, 2009, a bank shot assisted by Marvin Williams. On March 19, 2010, Johnson hit a game-winning buzzer beater in overtime against the Charlotte Bobcats.\nOn July 8, 2010, Johnson re-signed with the Hawks to a six-year, $123.7 million contract, which, at the time, made him the NBA's highest-paid player. The signing occurred during one of the most star-studded free agency summers in league history, highlighted by LeBron James’\"Decision\" TV special. Among others who signed high-profile deals were Chris Bosh, Dwyane Wade, Amar'e Stoudemire, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Dirk Nowitzki.\nBrooklyn Nets (2012–2016).\nOn July 11, 2012, Johnson was traded to the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Jordan Farmar, Anthony Morrow, Jordan Williams, Johan Petro, DeShawn Stevenson and a 2013 first round draft pick. After a slow start to the 2012–13 season, Johnson began to pick up his play in December, with a 32-point game against the Golden State Warriors on December 7 and a game-winning buzzer beater in double overtime against the Detroit Pistons on December 14. After scoring 33 points in a road win over the Oklahoma City Thunder on January 2, he hit another game winner in double overtime two days later to beat the Washington Wizards. In a 113–111 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks on February 19, Johnson made the game-tying three-pointer with just under three seconds to go in regulation and went on to hit the game-winning pull-up jump shot in overtime. With this win, the Nets snapped a thirteen-game losing streak against the Bucks. The next game the Nets played, Johnson injured his left heel and was forced to miss three games. He made his return on March 1 against the Dallas Mavericks.\nOn November 15, 2013, Johnson made his first game-winning basket of the season against the Phoenix Suns as he went in for a layup to give the Nets their first road win of the 2013–14 season. On December 16, 2013, Johnson recorded a career-high 10 three-pointers in a 130–94 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. In the third quarter, Johnson scored 29 points on 10-of-13 shooting from the field including 8-of-10 three-pointers. On January 2, 2014, after the Nets were down by sixteen points, Johnson made his second game-winning basket of the season to lead the Nets to a 95–93 win to give Oklahoma City Thunder its second home loss of the season. Johnson later earned his seventh All-Star game selection.\nIn just the second game of the 2014–15 season on November 1, Johnson scored a season-high 34 points on 14-of-23 shooting to help the Nets defeat the Detroit Pistons, 102–90. On February 25, in a game against the New Orleans Pelicans, he became just the seventh player in NBA history to record 18,000 career points and 1,600 career three-pointers made.\nOn November 14, 2015, in a loss to the Golden State Warriors, Johnson appeared in his 1,072nd NBA regular season game, matching Michael Jordan for 77th on the all-time list. On November 28, in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers, he extended his streak of making at least one field goal to 900 regular season games, the longest active streak. He extended that streak to 919 games on January 6, 2016 in a loss to the Toronto Raptors. Three days later, he hit two three-pointers against the Detroit Pistons, thus surpassing Peja Stojaković for 11th on the career three-pointers list. On January 24, in a win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, he became the 31st player in NBA history to reach 40,000 minutes. On February 5, he recorded season highs of 27 points and 11 assists in a 128–119 win over the Sacramento Kings. On February 8, he recorded 12 points and 8 assists against the Denver Nuggets, and hit a buzzer-beating three-pointer to lift the Nets to a 105–104 win. In that game, he passed Scottie Pippen for 52nd place on the NBA's all-time scoring list. In the following game two days later, Johnson failed to score against the Memphis Grizzlies, going scoreless in a regular season game for the first time since December 6, 2003, ending the NBA's longest active streak with at least one field goal. He had a basket in 937 straight games. On February 25, Johnson was waived by the Nets in a buyout agreement.\nMiami Heat (2016).\nOn February 27, 2016, Johnson signed with the Miami Heat. The next day, he made his debut and first start for the Heat in a 98–81 win over the New York Knicks, recording 12 points, three rebounds and three assists in 30 minutes. In his second game for the Heat on March 1 against the Chicago Bulls, Johnson scored 24 points and passed Reggie Theus for 50th on the NBA's career scoring list. On March 12, he scored a season-high 28 points in a 112–104 overtime loss to the Toronto Raptors. Johnson helped the Heat advance to the second round of the playoffs, where they were defeated 4–3 by the Raptors.\nUtah Jazz (2016–2018).\nOn July 8, 2016, Johnson signed a two-year, $22 million contract with the Utah Jazz. He joined the Jazz with the intention being to come off the bench behind Gordon Hayward. But with an injury to Hayward during preseason, Johnson was thrust into the starting line-up in his absence. He made his debut for the Jazz in their season opener on October 25, scoring a team-high 29 points in a 113–104 loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. With Hayward's return to line-up on November 6 to face the New York Knicks, Johnson came off the bench for the first time since December 9, 2003. On February 8, 2017, Johnson highlighted a 27-point performance with six three-pointers on eight attempts in a 127–94 win over the New Orleans Pelicans. On April 15, 2017, Johnson scored a team-high 21 points off the bench and hit a game-winning floater at the buzzer to give the Jazz a 97–95 win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 1 of their first-round playoff series. Eight days later in Game 4, Johnson again paced the Jazz with 28 points off the bench to give them a 105–98 victory and tie the series with the Clippers at 2–2. The Jazz went on to eliminate the Clippers with a 104–91 victory in Game 7, closing out the first-round series 4–3 to earn the franchise's first postseason series victory since 2010.\nJohnson missed 21 games early in the 2017–18 season while dealing with a right wrist injury.\nOn February 8, 2018, Johnson was acquired by the Sacramento Kings in a three-team trade that involved the Jazz and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Three days later, he was waived by the Kings before appearing in a game for them.\nHouston Rockets (2018).\nOn February 14, 2018, Johnson signed with the Houston Rockets. He made his debut for the Rockets later that day, scoring nine points in 31 minutes off the bench in a 100–91 win over the Sacramento Kings.\nTriplets Big3 and The Basketball Tournament (2019–present).\nIn March 2019, Johnson signed to play in the BIG3. On August 27, 2019, Johnson was named BIG3 MVP. On September 1, 2019, he won his first BIG3 championship with the Triplets, defeating the Killer 3's.\nOn September 19, 2019, Johnson returned to the NBA, signing with the Detroit Pistons. He was later waived by the team on October 21, 2019, with final cuts looming.\nJohnson competed for Overseas Elite in The Basketball Tournament 2020, helping them to the semifinals. He was named to the All-Tournament team.\nOn September 4, 2021, Johnson won his second BIG3 MVP title.\nJohnson retired during the 2022 BIG3 season, however, Johnson returned to BIG3 for 2023.\nReturn to the Celtics (2021–2022).\nOn December 22, 2021, Johnson signed a 10-day contract with the Boston Celtics to return to the franchise that drafted him after the team was granted a hardship exception. His appearance that same night against the Cleveland Cavaliers marked a 19-year, 305-day gap between his stints with the Celtics, which is the longest gap in NBA history. He also made his lone shot in that appearance, making him the second player along with Dirk Nowitzki to score a basket with the same team at the age of 20 and at the age of 40. His sole appearance for the Celtics in 2021 would be the final appearance of his NBA career. It was his first NBA action in 1,669 days, his last appearance coming in the 2018 NBA playoffs with the Rockets on May 28, 2018.\nNational team career.\nOn March 5, 2006, Johnson was one of 23 NBA players named to the 2006–08 United States national team and played for the United States national team in the 2006 FIBA World Championship. He helped USA win the bronze medal by defeating Argentina in the third place game after a loss to Greece in the semi-finals. In nine games, Johnson averaged 7.3 points.\nIn February 2021, Johnson was selected to the 14-player roster for the final round of the 2022 FIBA AmeriCup qualification. On February 19, he scored 11 points and had a team best plus-25 point differential in a 93–77 victory over the Bahamas. On February 20, he had 11 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists and 2 blocks in a 96–75 victory against Mexico.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson's mother, Diane, was a former state psychiatric hospital nurse. She raised her only son by herself in Little Rock, benefiting from the help of a close family that included her mother and brothers. She was diagnosed in 2008 with multiple myeloma, a rare and typically incurable cancer of bone marrow plasma cells. She died in 2018."

        "text": "Historically, English rugby league clubs competed for the Lancashire Cup and the Yorkshire Cup, known collectively as the county cups. The leading rugby clubs in Yorkshire had played in a cup competition (affectionately known as \"t’owd tin pot\") for several years prior to the schism of 1895. However, the Lancashire authorities had refused to sanction a similar tournament, fearing it would lead to professionalism.\nAfter the split, the replacement for the Yorkshire Cup was not immediately introduced; however, new Yorkshire and Lancashire Cups were introduced in the 1905–06 season.\nThe county cups were played on the same basis as the Challenge Cup, with an open draw and straight knock-out matches leading to a final.\nThe county cups were abandoned in 1993 due to the more successful clubs complaining about overloaded fixtures, but the Yorkshire Cup was revived in 2019.\nTV coverage.\nThe BBC regularly televised both the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals from 1958-59 to 1984–85 usually as part of the \"Grandstand\" programme but after 1984–85 the BBC dropped the county cups from its Rugby League coverage due to cutbacks. But from 1987-88 to 1990–91 both the Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals were televised by ITV in their respective regions. In 1987–88, 1988–89, 1989–90 and 1990–91 Yorkshire Television through their Scrumdown programme with live coverage. The Lancashire Cup final was televised by Granada in 1989–90 and 1990–91 under the Rugby League Live name again with live coverage. The 1991–92 Lancashire and Yorkshire Cup finals were both shown by British Aerospace Sportscast the Yorkshire Cup Final was live but the Lancashire Cup Final was recorded and shown on the Monday Night. But the last finals in 1992–93 were not shown on TV. The 1985–86 and 1986–87 Yorkshire Cup finals and the Lancashire Cup finals in 1985–86, 1986–87, 1987–88 and 1988–89 also had no TV coverage. The 1965–66 and 1968–69 Lancashire Cup finals were played on a Friday night and likely to have been recorded by the BBC and shown on \"Grandstand\" the following day."

        "title": "Assist (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, an assist is attributed to a player who passes the ball to a teammate in a way that leads directly to a score by field goal, meaning that they were \"assisting\" in the basket. An assist is also credited when a basket is awarded due to defensive goaltending. \nThere is some judgment involved in deciding whether a passer should be credited with an assist. An assist can be scored for the passer even if the player who receives the pass makes a basket after dribbling the ball for a short distance. However, the original definition of an assist did not include such situations, so the comparison of assist statistics across eras is a complex matter.\nOnly the pass directly before the score may be counted as an assist, so no more than one assist can be recorded per field goal (unlike in other sports, such as ice hockey). A pass that leads to a shooting foul and scoring by free throws does not count as an assist in the NBA, but does in FIBA play (only one assist is awarded per set of free throws in which at least one free throw is made).\nPoint guards tend to get the most assists per game (apg), as their role is primarily that of a passer and ballhandler. \nCenters tend to get fewer assists, but centers with good floor presence and court vision can dominate a team by assisting. Being inside the key, the center often has the best angles and the best position for \"dishes\" and other short passes in the scoring area. Current NBA Center Nikola Jokić is among the league leaders in assists and play-making. Center Wilt Chamberlain led the NBA in total assists in 1968. A strong center with inside-scoring prowess, such as former NBA center Hakeem Olajuwon, can also be an effective assister because the defense's double-teaming tends to open up offense in the form of shooters.\nThe NBA single-game assist team record is 53, held by the Milwaukee Bucks, on December 26, 1978. The NBA single-game assist individual record is 30, held by Scott Skiles of the Orlando Magic on December 30, 1990.\nThe NBA record for most career assists is held by John Stockton, with 15,806. Stockton also holds the NBA single season assist per game record with 14.5 during the 1989-1990 regular season. The highest career assist per game average in NBA history is held by Magic Johnson, with 11.2 assists per game."

        "title": "Battle of the Tennis Court",
        "text": "The Battle of the Tennis Court was part of the wider Battle of Kohima that was fought in North East India from 4 April to 22 June 1944 during the Burma Campaign of the Second World War. The Japanese advance into India was halted at Kohima in April 1944 and Garrison Hill, on a long wooded ridge on a high ridge west of the village, was, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission the scene of \"perhaps the most bitter fighting of the whole Burma campaign when a small Commonwealth force held out against repeated attacks by a Japanese Division\". During the siege of Kohima, heavy fighting, including hand-to-hand combat, occurred in the grounds surrounding the Deputy Commissioner's bungalow, including the tennis court, beginning around 8 April and continuing until 13 May when the assaulting Japanese troops began withdrawing from the area.\nPrelude.\nKohima Ridge was about a mile long and about 400 yards wide, with a series of hills and gullies that ran alongside the road from Imphal to Dimapur. The steep slopes along the road made the ridge a formidable target for attackers, but it was a narrow space from which to repel an enemy attacking in strength. In March 1944, the Japanese launched Operation U-Go, a large-scale invasion of India. By 6 the British, Nepalese and Indian soldiers of Kohima Garrison had been surrounded on the Kohima ridge. As the siege began the Kohima Ridge was defended to the south (facing Imphal) by the 1st Assam Regiment on Jail Hill. The centre ground of the ridge was mainly defended by 4th Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment. The North West of the Ridge, known as Hospital Spur, was defended by the 3rd Assam Rifles who were facing the road to Dimapur. The North East of the Ridge on a sharp corner in the road was where the Deputy Commissioner (DC) Charles Pawsey's Bungalow and Tennis Court was situated. This was initially guarded by a composite group of soldiers, thought to be British and Gurkha troops from the local Reinforcement Depot.\nBattle.\nThe Japanese launched a series of attacks into the north-east region of the defences on 8 April, including two attacks on the DC's Bungalow area. The Japanese suffered massive losses, but poured in reinforcements to prepare for another attack. Some Allied soldiers manned a Bren gun to cover the withdrawal from the DC's Bungalow to the other side of the asphalt tennis court 12m higher up the hill. They held on to the last round but were then overrun, bayoneted and shot. At this stage the Battle of the Tennis Court could be said to have begun with the area being rapidly reinforced by A Company of the 4th Battalion, Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment.\nDuring 9 April and before dawn on 10 April the Japanese 58 Regiment attacked the Allied defenders of the Tennis Court area almost every 30 minutes. Major Tom Kenyon, officer commanding (OC) A Company of the 4th Royal West Kents, commanded the British, Indian and Gurkha defenders who had now dug weapon pits and trenches on the western edge of the tennis court. During 10 April these defences and the overhead cover saved many lives as artillery shells landed on the Allied positions. The forward trenches ran out of ammunition on several occasions but were repeatedly resupplied by Sergeant Williams, who was awarded a Military Medal for his bravery.\nThe decision was made on 12 April to relieve the defenders of the Tennis Court with B Company of the 4th Royal West Kents, commanded by Major John Winstanley. During B Company's first night defending the Tennis Court, the Japanese forces attacked silently, wearing plimsoll shoes, instead of boots. They nearly overran the British forward positions with one of the platoon commanders, Lieutenant Tom Hogg, surviving a bayonet attack before firing all 25 rounds from his weapon (probably a Bren light machine gun), killing his assailant.\nOn 13 April, heavy Japanese artillery and mortar fire fell around the DC's bungalow and the tennis court area. Several assaults were made by Japanese infantry, although these were repelled in what the British Ministry of Defence describes as \"some of the hardest, closest and grimmest fighting, with grenades being hurled across the tennis court at point-blank range\". But on 14 April the Japanese did not launch an attack, and on 15 April the British and Indian troops on Kohima ridge heard that the British 2nd Infantry Division was attacking along the Dimapur–Kohima road and had broken through Japanese roadblocks to relieve troops of the 161st Indian Infantry Brigade around Jotsoma, about west of Kohima.\nOn 17 April, the Japanese tried one last time to take the ridge and captured Field Supply Depot (FSD) Hill and Kuki Piquet. On the morning of 18 April, British artillery opened up from the west against the Japanese positions, which stopped the Japanese attacks. Elements of the British 2nd Division, the 161st Indian Brigade and tanks from XXXIII Corps pushed into the area north-west of Garrison Hill and forced the Japanese from their positions. The road between Dimapur and Kohima had been opened and the siege was lifted.\nPart of the Allied force relieving the siege was the 1/1st Punjab Regiment of the 161st Indian Brigade. By the evening of 18 April, D Company of 1/1st Punjab Regiment (Major Gavin Dunnett) were facing the Japanese forces in the Tennis Court area. They were attacked almost immediately by the 58th Infantry Regiment, a battle in which a South East Asia Command Public Relations officer later reported \"a grenade match was played across the bungalow's tennis courts\". The 1/1st Punjab Regiment took 22 casualties and lost ground, only to retake it again the following day (19 April) during which Jemadar Mohammed Rafiq was awarded the Military Cross for leading his platoon against Japanese bunkers. The 1/1st Punjab Regiment seem to have moved rearwards on 21 April, having suffered 120 casualties, to be replaced by C Company of the 1st Battalion, Royal Berkshire Regiment, part of the 6th Brigade of the British 2nd Division, who were themselves relieved by D Company of the same battalion on 23 April.\nThe Japanese who had been fighting to capture Kohima did not retreat at once. Many of them stayed in the positions which they had captured and fought tenaciously for several more weeks. It is not entirely clear when the battle for the Tennis Court was won, but tanks operating from the road supported an infantry attack that captured the Tennis Court area on 10 May 1944. By the morning of 13 May, most of the positions on the Kohima ridge had been re-taken by the British and Indian forces. On that day the DC's bungalow was finally recaptured by the 2nd Battalion, Dorset Regiment supported by Grant tanks firing from the Tennis Court. The lead tank was driven by Sergeant Waterhouse of 149th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps (149th RAC), firing his gun into Japanese bunkers at no more than . This tank was supported by two platoons of the Dorsets commanded by Sergeants Given and Cook. The Allied breakthrough that ended the Battle of the Tennis Court is depicted in a 1982 painting by Terence Cuneo which is displayed in the Kohima Museum in Imphal Barracks, York.\nThe fighting within the 6th Brigade's area was documented by Major Boshell, who commanded 'B' Company of the 1st Royal Berkshires, in the 6th Infantry Brigade, 2nd Division:\nAftermath.\nAround 15 May the Japanese 31st Division began to withdraw and the fresh British and Indian troops from XXXIII Corps began to reinforce and relieve the British 2nd Division and the 33rd and 161st Indian Brigades. In the aftermath of the fighting around Kohima, the troops of the Fourteenth Army began an advance, with the relief of Imphal, which would continue until Burma had been recaptured. The battle was the turning point of the Battle of Kohima which was the watershed of the Burma Campaign. Earl Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander in the theatre, described Kohima as\nThe Imperial War Museum Duxford has a diorama of the battle, amongst others."

        "text": "The 2004 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2004 Formula 1 Fuji Television Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 October 2004 at the Suzuka Circuit. It was Race 17 of 18 in the 2004 FIA Formula One World Championship.\nFriday drivers.\nThe bottom 6 teams in the 2003 Constructors' Championship were entitled to run a third car in free practice on Friday. These drivers drove on Friday but did not compete in qualifying or the race.\nWirdheim and Briscoe could not got to drive any single lap Friday training sessions. Teams confirmed it as a reason for not driving the drivers that they had a limited number of tyres for very wet weather, and were therefore not sufficient for the cars of the third drivers.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThis was Jarno Trulli's first race with the Toyota team after missing the previous race. This was Olivier Panis's last race as he decided to retire from the race seat. But he stayed with the Toyota team, as the test driver.\nQualifying.\nAll the running on Saturday was cancelled due to Typhoon Ma-on, meaning that both the qualifying sessions were run on Sunday morning. Qualifying took place on a track that was still damp but is drying out; Michael Schumacher took advantage of this and, taking to the track among the last thanks to an excellent performance in the first session, won pole position, with a large advantage over his rivals. Second was Ralf Schumacher, while Webber surprisingly took third place, still a full second behind the pole position time. The two BARs of Sato and Button followed, preceding Trulli, Fisichella, Coulthard and Villeneuve. The difficult conditions of the track put several drivers in difficulty: Alonso, Räikkönen, Montoya and Barrichello made mistakes, relegated to the second half of the grid.\nRace.\nAfter some testing plagued by bad weather, the race started in dry conditions and sunshine. At the start, Michael and Ralf Schumacher had no difficulty maintaining the lead. Webber on the other hand, started poorly and was overtaken by Button, Sato and Trulli. Michael Schumacher immediately gained a clear advantage over his opponents. The only one who drove a similar pace was his brother Ralf, who also went into the pits first on the 9th lap. When Michael Schumacher refueled four laps later, he rejoined the track as the leader, ahead of Button (who started with a two-stop strategy and therefore had not yet pitted). The race for first place was practically over. While the BAR duo fought for third place (Sato with a three-stop strategy against Button's), the race is livened up by the comeback of Barrichello, Montoya, Räikkönen and Alonso; Trulli, however, is relegated and, having started with little petrol on board, has to deal with a Toyota that is very difficult to manage with a full tank of fuel.\nOn lap 20, Webber retired for a rather unusual reason: the cockpit of his Jaguar inexplicably overheated to such an extent that the Australian driver suffered minor burns on his thigh. After the first series of stops, Trulli, Montoya, Barrichello and Fisichella gave rise to an intense duel, with the Sauber driver having difficulty with the tyres, having to give way to the Brazilian from Ferrari, but managing to defend himself from the other two until his second refueling, on the 24th lap. Michael Schumacher continued to lead undisturbed and didn't relinquish the lead for one lap. His brother Ralf also had no particular difficulties defending his second place from the two BAR drivers. Coulthard climbs sharply up the overall standings and initially only makes two stops. With around twenty laps to go, the Scot was in fifth place, having refueled for the second time.\nBehind him, however, Barrichello quickly recovered. On lap 38, the Brazilian attempted an attack, but the McLaren driver came out of the corner and the two subsequently touched each other. The two cars were damaged beyond repair and both had to give up. Alonso moved up to fifth place. Meanwhile, Button prevailed against his teammate in the duel for the podium. Sato got off to a slow start and pain from an old shoulder injury returned during the race and had to go without liquid for much of the race when a water bottle stopped working. BAR virtually secured second place in the Constructors' Championship. The team increased its advantage over Renault to 16 points with one race remaining.\nThere were no more surprises in the final laps and Michael Schumacher won ahead of Ralf Schumacher, Button, Sato, Alonso, Räikkönen, Montoya and Fisichella. It was Ferrari's fifteenth victory of the season. In doing so, they equaled the previous record of the McLaren, which won fifteen out of sixteen Grands Prix victories in , and the Ferrari, which won fifteen out of seventeen in .\nIt was the last time the Schumacher brothers finished in 1–2 formation (having done so on four other occasions: 2001 Canadian Grand Prix, 2001 French Grand Prix, 2002 Brazilian Grand Prix, 2003 Canadian Grand Prix). It was also the last 1-2 finish between German drivers until the 2013 Indian Grand Prix.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was held on Sunday morning due to weather conditions on Saturday."

        "title": "Box score (baseball)",
        "text": "A box score is a chart used in baseball to present data about player achievement in a particular game. An abbreviated version of the box score, duplicated from the field scoreboard, is the line score. The Baseball Hall of Fame credits Henry Chadwick with the invention of the box score in 1858.\nLine score.\nThe line score is a two-line chart that reports each team's run totals by inning, and total runs, total hits, and total errors on a line. The visiting team is on the top line and the home team on the bottom line. The terms \"top of the inning\" and \"bottom of the inning\" are derived from their positions in the line score. Sometimes, the winning team is bolded or colored for quick-reference. If the home team is leading after the top of the 9th inning, an \"X\" is placed for that team's entry in the line score for the bottom of the 9th inning instead of a number of runs scored since the team does not bat in the bottom of the 9th inning.\nLine score for the Brooklyn Dodgers–New York Giants pennant-winning game of October 3, 1951:\nBox score.\nThe box score lists the line score as well as individual and team performance in the game. The statistics used are those recorded by the official scorer of each game.\nThe following box score is of a notable game in baseball history, Game 6 of the 1991 World Series.\nAt the top of the box score, the editor of a publication may list the time, date, and/or place of the game. In the example, the stadium's name (\"the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome\") and city (\"Minneapolis\") are listed.\nThe line score is always listed as part of the box score, usually near the top; it lists the total runs scored in each inning. (\"The Atlanta Braves scored two runs in the fifth inning and one in the seventh. The Minnesota Twins scored two runs in the first inning, one in the fifth, and one in the eleventh. \") Innings are normally grouped in sets of three for ease of reading. The team totals of runs, hits, and errors are listed last, after a separating character such as a dash. The actual score of the game is represented by the first column after the dash; (\"the Twins won this game four runs to three.\")\nThe batting performances of each player in the game are grouped by team, with the visiting team listed first. Players are listed by last name in the order in which they were listed on the lineup card for the game, showing all players who enter the game at any point whether they make a plate appearance or not. Their fielding positions or batting roles are normally listed next to their last name. Typically only last names are used, unless two players with the same name appear in the game, in which case a distinctive first initial is also used. When a player switches fielding position, both positions are listed. (\"Brian Hunter, in the sixth position of the Braves' batting order, started at left field but also served as the first baseman.\") Substitute players are listed where they were placed in the batting order (in cases such as a double switch, not necessarily in the position of the player they replaced). Players who had an offensive role only are listed by that role: \"ph\" if they entered as a pinch hitter or \"pr\" if as a pinch runner. Substitutes who enter for defensive purposes and do not make a plate appearance have their fielding position shown and their batting line score shown as zeros. When a pinch hitter or pinch runner remains in the game, his fielding position is also listed. Some box scores will indent substitutes' names to indicate their spot in the order was the same as the non-indented starter's name above it; others will leave all names left-justified. (\"The Twins' Brian Harper pinch hit for Junior Ortiz and then remained in the game as catcher.\")\nBatting statistics are displayed to the right of the names in the lineup. At minimum are shown each batter's at bats, runs, hits, and runs batted in. Some box scores show other player statistics such as home runs, stolen bases, bases on balls, strikeouts, fielding errors, times left on base, home runs, or season batting average. At the bottom of the lineup are the team totals for each category.\nAdditional batting, fielding, and base-running statistics are listed in non-tabular form normally below the batting order summaries:\nBelow the batting orders and line score, the pitching summary is listed. Each pitcher used in the game is listed, along with any decision awarded to that pitcher. A pitcher can be credited with a win, a loss, a save, or a hold. Cumulative totals for pitching decisions are also shown, for either regular season or post-season play. To the right of each pitcher's name are recorded the total innings pitched, hits given up, runs allowed, earned runs allowed, bases on balls issued, and strikeouts made. More elaborate statistics may also be displayed, such as home runs allowed, pitch count, or the pitcher's cumulative earned run average.\nOther pitching events are shown below the summary.\nOther overall game information is shown at the bottom of the box score.\nMost box scores also give the temperature, weather, and wind speed/direction.\nOther events not shown in the example but recorded in most box scores include sacrifice hits (\"S\"), triple plays (\"TP\"), balks (\"BK\"), blown saves (\"BS\"), and passed balls (\"PB\"). Many box scores, to save space, do not list any categories where none of that event occurred in the game. Others will list the category followed by \" – None\".\nIn a baseball game, the number of plate appearances for each team must be equal to the number of batters put out, scored, and left on base. A box score is in balance (or proved) when the total of the team's times at bat, bases on balls received, hit batters, sacrifice bunts, sacrifice flies and batters awarded first base because of interference or obstruction equals the total of that team's runs, players left on base and the opposing team's putouts. In other words, the box score is accounting for the number of batters and what became of them (scored, left on base, or put out). If a box score is unbalanced, then there is a logical contradiction and thus an error somewhere in the box score.\nEarly box scores.\nThe first box scores tended to be vaguely related to cricket scorekeeping, in that only two offense-oriented figures were presented for each batter: \"O\" and \"R\", meaning \"number of times put out\" and \"number of runs scored\", respectively.\nAs fan interest in all aspects of the game increased, the box scores were revised and expanded to include the offensive categories At-Bats, Runs, Hits and sometimes Total Bases; and the defensive categories Put-Outs, Assists and Errors for each batter, as well as a statistical summary underneath the lineups listing extra-base hits, innings pitched, earned runs, etc.\nIn baseball, if the team scheduled to bat last is leading after 8½ innings, there is no turn at bat for that team, as it would not affect the outcome of the game, so the last of the ninth is usually marked with an \"X\" as a placeholder in the line score. Some newspapers (and some scoreboards) in those days showed the home team in the top line, resulting in the peculiarity of an \"X\" placed in what appeared to be the \"top\" of the ninth. This practice was a carryover from the time when the home team had the choice of whether to bat first or last, another similarity with cricket. Teams would often choose to bat first, counting on their ability to \"get the jump\" on the visiting team (as with football teams that win the coin toss), but the potential for the visitors scoring the winning run in the last of ninth was clearly an unsatisfying situation for the fans. The rules eventually required the home team to bat last, but the practice of listing the home team first was carried on for a while, in some places, even when it did not square with the actual events of the game.\nThe offensive statistic Runs Batted In was developed in the early 1900s, and was soon being carried in the lineup portion of the box scores.\nAs relief pitching became more common, a separate \"lineup\" section for the pitchers was developed, carrying individual Innings Pitched; the number of Hits, Runs, Earned Runs, and Bases on Balls allowed; and Strike-Outs achieved.\nBy the late 1960s or so, in the interest of space, most newspapers dropped the defensive stats from the lineups, just carrying the list of errors (if any) in the game summary. For a special event, such as World Series play (especially if a local team is involved), newspapers still often print the wider version of the box score."

        "title": "1974 British Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "The 1974 British Commonwealth Games () was held in Christchurch, New Zealand from 24 January to 2 February 1974. The bid vote was held in Edinburgh at the 1970 British Commonwealth Games. The event was officially named \"the friendly games\". There were 1,276 competitors and 372 officials, according to the official history, and public attendance was excellent. The main venue was the QEII Park, purpose-built for this event. The Athletics Stadium and fully covered Olympic standard pool, diving tank, and practice pools were all on the one site. The theme song was \"Join Together\", sung by Steve Allen. The event was held after the 1974 Commonwealth Paraplegic Games in Dunedin for wheelchair athletes.\nPreparation.\nSecurity.\nThe event was the first large international athletic event after the murder of Israeli athletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics. The Athletes Village, the Student accommodation of the University of Canterbury, was temporarily fenced in and guarded for the duration of the games. Only official vehicles and persons were allowed into sensitive areas around the venues.\nLogo.\nThe logo was the second (after Edinburgh) to be protected and trademarked, and set a design benchmark which was echoed in the logos of the next five games. The logo was designed by Wellington designer Colin Simons as the result of a design competition, and posters were designed by Bret de Thier.\nIn recent years the logo has been regarded as one of New Zealand's iconic symbols, being reproduced on clothing and elsewhere.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony was held in the mid afternoon, with Prince Philip as the attending royal. A fanfare announced the guard of honour by the New Zealand Defence Forces, inspected by Prince Philip. This was followed by the raising of flags of the past, present, and future hosts. God Save the Queen was sung. The field was then invaded by 2500 school children in red, white and blue rain slicks all forming in the centre to create the NZ74 symbol. The official promotional song, 'Join Together', composed especially for the games by Steve Allen, was performed by a mass choir, as well as 'What the world needs now is love'. A Māori concert group then performed action songs and a haka, before the teams march past. The athletes then took the oath and Sylvia Potts, the runner who fell mere meters from a gold medal finish in the 1970 Games, entered the stadium with the Queen's Baton. It was presented to Prince Philip who read the message from the Queen declaring the 1974 Christchurch 10th British Commonwealth Games open. The Commonwealth flag was then marched in and hauled up with a 21-gun salute.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Games were also an important milestone in New Zealand television, marking the introduction of colour television. However, due to the NZBC's limited colour facilities, only athletics, swimming, and boxing could be broadcast in colour.\nMeanwhile, paralleling the television coverage, the National Film Unit produced Games '74, a feature-length documentary of the Christchurch games (and the many events) in full colour. This has since been restored and is available on DVD.\nLegacy.\nEconomic aspects.\nChristchurch was (and still is) the smallest city to host the modern televised Commonwealth Games. This was the first games that tried using the \"Olympic\" look with a standard colour scheme for facilities, passes, flags, stationery, and above all uniforms (which wearers only borrowed, but could buy outright as a memento thus helping keep costs down).\nIts striking NZ74 design logo is now a well used (sometimes illegally) symbol of New Zealand as a nation and Christchurch as a city. It is still copyright owned by Christchurch City Council but is allowed for free use unless for commercial gain. Badges, lapels, stationery and postcards are still in re-manufactured circulation.\nThis was also the first time that a city had asked the Games Federation to allow commercial advertising. This was voted down as the Federation feared that advertising by big corporations would remove focus away from the amateur ethos of the Games. As no commercial hoardings were allowed, Christchurch got around this with the use of \"sponsorship\", one example being General Motors providing a lease fleet of Holden HQ Kingswood sedans that would be sold off after the games. The cars are now sought after by private and museum collectors and have depreciated little in value.\nAir New Zealand allowed large NZ74 symbols to be placed on the fuselage sides of the airline's brand new McDonnell Douglas DC-10s, giving free advertising around the world. This in itself set a trend since with airlines vying to be \"official airline\" of a particular event.\nAlthough the Games themselves were a success, making a then sizable profit of $500,000, the \"sponsorship\" was nowhere near enough. The City of Christchurch was left with a financial facilities management debt (QEII Park) of what would be in today's (2016) amount of NZ$120 million. This deterred the city from hosting major events until 1990 when the government stepped in with lotteries funding to clear the remaining debt. By then, Auckland's 1990 games had been fully commercialized.\nQueen Elizabeth II Park\nThe most visible facility left behind by the 1974 Commonwealth Games was the purpose-built stadium and swimming complex. For a few years after, the stadium was a popular destination for sports and leisure patrons who were well indulged in first class facilities. However the costs of maintaining the complex grew over time and soon other additions included hydro-slides and fun park outside on the large grassed area that was once the race course. Christchurch City Council, the owner of the complex continued to develop the ground and for five years from 1990, allowed the Canterbury Greyhound Club to run a track on the inner oval. The main swimming pool was adapted so it could be decked over for Basketball and Netball. Football and Rugby League returned to the stadium in 1995 on a more permanent basis and a minor refurbishment of the track saw athletics events become a main summer event again. Early plans for a hosting of the 2022 Commonwealth Games were in hand when the September 2010 earthquake of around 7.1 hit near Christchurch and damaged the facility. Assessors immediately reported that the damage was repairable and could be covered by insurance. The swimming pools were drained to await repair when the more devastating 22 February 2011 earthquake struck Christchurch, damaging the entire facility, already weakened, beyond economic repair. After laying abandoned for three years, the stadium was demolished and by 2016 the ground stabilized in preparation of more economical facilities and a connecting high school.\nFuture 2026/2030 Bids proposals\nAs a rebuilding legacy, there have been calls for Christchurch to bid for the new style Commonwealth Games that allow a core central city to host a more nationwide event. This has been seen as a more economical format for smaller cities, and countries to host what had become an expensive event for a singular city to host.\nPrecedents set.\nWhile the opening ceremony was a regimented and very formal affair, the late afternoon closing ceremony was anything but. \nThis set a precedent for other closing ceremonies since then. With the formalities out of the way, the handing over of the flag to representatives of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, the athletes broke ranks and ran amok, much to the delight of the packed stadium and the Queen herself. A flypast of the then Red Checkers RNZAF display team brought the ceremony to a close as the Queen and Prince Philip did a lap of honour around the stadium and departed.\nThe youngest competitor at the games was New Zealander Rebecca Perrott, 12; swimming for Fiji at the games, as her father was Registrar at the University of the South Pacific.\nParticipating teams.\n38 teams were represented at the 1974 Games.(Teams competing for the first time are shown in bold).\nReferences.\n\"Official History of the Xth British Commonwealth Games\" edited by A.

        "text": "The 1982 Commonwealth Games was held in Brisbane, Australia, from 30 September to 9 October 1982. The Opening Ceremony was held at the QEII Stadium (named after Elizabeth II), in the Brisbane suburb of Nathan. The QEII Stadium was also the athletics and archery events venue. Other events were held at the purpose-built Sleeman Sports Complex in Chandler.\nThe Chairman of the 1982 Commonwealth Games was Sir Edward Williams. The 1982 Commonwealth Games Logo was designed by Paulo Ferreira, who was the winner of a nationwide competition held in 1982. The symbol is derived from the form of a bounding kangaroo. The three bands, forming stylized A's (for Australia), and a bicycle frame representing Cycling they are in colours which are common to flags of many Commonwealth countries.\nThe mascot for the games was a cartoon kangaroo called Matilda. A 13-metre-high (42.65 feet) mechanical kangaroo travelled around the stadium and winked at the crowd.\nThe event was officially opened by The Duke of Edinburgh and closed by Elizabeth II.\nHost selection.\nBidding for the XII Commonwealth Games was held in Montreal, Canada, at the 1976 Montreal Summer Olympics. Lagos, Brisbane, Kuala Lumpur, and Birmingham were the bidding cities. On 14 July 1976, it was announced that Brisbane had won the rights to stage the Games after the other candidate cities withdrew bids. Sixteen years after the Brisbane Games, Kuala Lumpur hosted the 1998 Commonwealth Games, while Birmingham hosted the 2022 Commonwealth Games.\nBrisbane was awarded the Games by default after being the only candidate city left at the bid election after Birmingham reversed its decision to submit an application. Nigeria's boycott of the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal made Lagos' bid lobbying impractical. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal were plagued with cost overruns, and bidding on a sports festival anywhere in the world was not good politically.\nParticipating teams.\nForty-six Commonwealth nations and territories took part in the 1982 Commonwealth Games. A total of 1,583 athletes and 571 officials participated in the event. The Griffith University student dormitories in Gold Coast and the adjoining Nathan Campus were used as athletes' villages.\nSports.\nSports contested during the 1982 Commonwealth Games included athletics, archery, badminton, lawn bowls, boxing, cycling, shooting, swimming, diving, weightlifting and wrestling.\nTable tennis and Australian rules football were demonstration sports, with the latter being demonstrated at a 6 October rematch at the Gabba of that year's VFL Grand Final, which took place just 11 days before at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Richmond won the demonstration rematch with a score of 28.16 (184) to Carlton's 26.10 (166).\nHighlights.\nOpening ceremony (30 September).\nThe ceremony at the QEII Stadium was held on a fine but extremely windy day. The wind was so strong that skydivers who were going to descend into the stadium were cancelled. Instead they made an entrance at the closing ceremony.\nDay 1 (1 October).\nThe first event of the Games was Road Trial in cycling. England won the Gold Medal in the event, and Australia won the Silver Medal—coming second to England by only six seconds.\nOther sports which were contested on the first day of competition included swimming and diving, weightlifting, shooting and bowls.\nDay 2 (2 October).\nSports contested included swimming, diving, weightlifting, shooting, cycling, bowls and archery.\nThe day was marred by both Australia and Canada being disqualified in the 4 × 100 metres relay in swimming, both problems occurring during change-overs. The medals awarded for this race went to England, Scotland and New Zealand.\nDay 4 (4 October).\nSports contested included swimming, diving, cycling, athletics, archery, hammer throwing and shooting.\nThe day was marred when Canada was again disqualified, this time in the 4 × 200 metres freestyle relay. Canada protested against the winners, Australia, as well as against their own disqualification.\nClosing ceremony.\nElizabeth II closed the Games during a colourful ceremony, which included parachute jumpers (who had originally been also intended as part of the Opening Ceremony display) jumping and landing in a special target area within the stadium and red, white and blue balloons. Matilda the Kangaroo also winked at the Queen. Following the closing of the Games, the Queen and the Duke left the stand to be driven from the stadium. However, nobody wanted the Games to end and the Australian team formed a 'guard of honour' and ran beside and behind the car in which Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip were travelling, as it circled the stadium several times before finally leaving. Team members from other countries also joined in running after the royal car.\nAboriginal movement protests.\nThe Brisbane Commonwealth Games were also noted by large-scale protests by the Aboriginal rights movement in Australia, which brought to the centre of international media attention the lack of Indigenous land rights in Australia, poor living condition and suppression of personal and political rights in Queensland in particular, and in Australia as a whole. One of the targets of the protests was Queensland's \"Aborigines Act 1971\", which restricted and controlled the lives of Aboriginal people in Queensland.\nThere were large marches on 26 September (2,000 people), 20 September (1000), and a sit-in of 104 people on 4 October. Also on that day, around 20 spectators held Aboriginal flags in the stadium during the entire program. On 7 October, about 500 people attended another protest, and 400 police arrested 260 people, including then Governor-General's daughter, Ann Stephen. The protests were all peaceful, but police came out in force and blocked roads, making arrests under Queensland's \"Traffic Act\".\nActivists taking part in the protests included Gary Foley and Bob Weatherall (both leaders of the protest); Billy Craigie; Lyall Munro Jnr; Ross Watson; Wayne Wharton; and Selwyn Johnson and his family. Selwyn's brother Hedley Johnson was a musician, of the Brisbane group Mop and the Dropouts. Their song, \"Brisbane Blacks\", written by Mop Conlon, became a kind of anthem for the protests.\nBob Weatherall, a Kamilaroi elder, is a lifelong activist, a researcher in Aboriginal history, and musical collaborator with Brisbane band Halfway\nThe protests, which were followed by large-scale arrests, are a significant event in the history of the Australian Aboriginal rights movement. When the Commonwealth Games returned to Australia in 2018 at the Gold Coast, it drew a series of peaceful protests.\nThe classic Australian film \"Guniwaya Ngigu (We Fight)\" documents the Aboriginal protest movement during the Commonwealth Games, and was directed by Madeline McGrady and Tracey Moffatt, and produced by Maureen Watson, Tiga Bayles and Madeline McGrady.\nLegacy.\nIn 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the 1982 Commonwealth Games were announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a \"Defining Moment\". Brisbane also bid for the 1992 Summer Olympics but lost to Barcelona. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced on 9 December 2019 that the state will make an official bid for the 2032 Summer Olympics featuring venues across Brisbane, Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast.\nMedals by country.\nThis is the full table of the medal count of the 1982 Commonwealth Games. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically.

Thirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries (largely African, Asian and Caribbean states) boycotted the event because of the Thatcher government's policy of keeping Britain's sporting links with apartheid South Africa.\nThe Games were commemorated on the UK’s first-ever £2 circulating coin, which showed a Scottish thistle upon the St. Andrew’s saltire design on the reverse side of the coin.\nOrganisation.\nUnlike the 1970 Games in Edinburgh, which were popular and successful, the 1986 Games are ill-famed for the wide political boycott connected with them and the resulting financial mismanagement.\nControversies.\nIn addition to the boycott, further controversy arose when it was revealed that through this much-reduced participation and the resultant decline in anticipated broadcasting and sponsorship revenues, the Organising Committee was facing a big financial black hole. The boycott ended any prospect of securing emergency government assistance. Businessman Robert Maxwell stepped in to offer funding, taking over as chairman; but although he promised to invest £2m, his contribution was just £250,000. On a budget of £14m, the Games opened with a deficit of £3m, which later grew to £4.3m, and instead of putting enough money into the event to save it, the new chairman of the Games asked creditors to forgo half the payment due to them to keep the event out of liquidation. The debt was finally paid off in 1989, with the city of Edinburgh losing approximately £500,000.\nSeveral athletes were excluded because they breached the amateurism rules, most notably lawn bowlers Phil Skoglund from New Zealand and Willie Wood from Scotland, both of whom have competed in subsequent Games.\nParticipating teams.\nDue to the boycott only 27 teams from across the Commonwealth were represented at the 1986 Games.\nBoycott.\nThirty two of the eligible fifty nine countries (largely African, Asian and Caribbean states) boycotted the event because of the Thatcher government's policy of keeping Britain's sporting links with apartheid South Africa in preference to participating in the general sporting boycott of that country. Consequently, Edinburgh 1986 witnessed the lowest turnout since Auckland 1950. Bermuda was a particularly late withdrawal, as its athletes had appeared in the opening ceremony and in the opening day of competition before the Bermuda Olympic Association decided to formally withdraw.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe theme of the opening ceremony celebrated the \"Spirit of Youth\" and included 6500 Scottish schoolchildren taking part in a series of large Mass Games-style Gymnastics routines. The theme song \"Spirit of Youth\" was written by Gerard Kenny. The ceremony began on the esplanade of Edinburgh Castle from which hundreds of schoolchildren ran down the Royal Mile, through Holyrood Park to Meadowbank Stadium.\nMedals by event.\nCycling.\nTrack\nRoad\nShooting.\nPistol\nRifle\nShotgun"

Primarily, it provides the results of notable tournaments throughout the year on both the ATP and WTA Tours, the Davis Cup, and the Fed Cup.\nOlympics and Chile.\nHeld from August 15 to August 22 in Athens, Greece, it consisted of four events; men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles. The standard 5th event, mixed doubles, was not part of these games. There were 170 participants (87 men and 83 women) from 52 countries. The events were held at the Athens Olympic Tennis Centre at the Athens Olympic Sports Complex. The surface was hardcourt, specifically DecoTurf, the same surface as used at the US Open in Flushing Meadow, New York. The Centre had 16 courts built specifically for the 2004 Olympics, with construction finished just before the opening of the Athens Olympics. There was a main court seating 6,000 fans for the Olympics, two show courts with seating for 3,200 seats during the Olympics, and 16 side courts with limited seating.\nChile won the most medals (three), two of which were gold, led by Nicolás Massú, who won the men's singles, and partnered by Fernando González, also helped Chile take gold in the doubles.\nRussian breakthrough.\nThe year 2004 was well known for the breakthrough of Russian players into the WTA Tour.\nAt the French Open, Anastasia Myskina became the first woman from Russia to win a Grand Slam singles title, by defeating compatriot Elena Dementieva in the final, 6–1, 6–2. A mere four weeks later, at Wimbledon, 17–year-old Maria Sharapova became the nation's second female Grand Slam winner, defeating two-time champion Serena Williams in the final, 6–1, 6–4, and becoming the third-youngest woman (after Lottie Dod and Martina Hingis) to win Wimbledon. Finally, at the US Open, Svetlana Kuznetsova became the nation's third consecutive winner of a Grand Slam singles title, defeating Dementieva in the final, 6–3, 7–5.\nOther Russian players also made an impact on the WTA Tour that year. Nadia Petrova cracked the WTA's Top 10 for the first time, and also achieved her biggest result that year, defeating defending US Open champion Justine Henin-Hardenne in the fourth round, before losing to Kuznetsova in the quarter-finals. Vera Zvonareva also continued to improve on the Tour before injuries briefly derailed her career the following year.\nThe conclusion of the season culminated in Sharapova winning the 2004 WTA Tour Championships by repeating her Wimbledon victory over Serena Williams in the final, 4–6, 6–2, 6–4, after coming from 0–4 down in the final set.\nATP.\nTennis Masters Cup.\nHouston, United States\nWTA.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nLos Angeles, USA\nWTA Tier I.\nToray Pan Pacific Open, Tokyo, Japan \nPacicic Life Open, Indian Wells, United States \nNASDAQ-100 Open, Miami, United States \nFamily Circle Cup, Charleston, United States\nQatar Total German Open, Berlin, Germany \nTelecom Italia Masters Roma, Rome, Italy\nAcura Classic, San Diego, United States\nRogers Cup presented by American Express, Montreal, Canada\nKremlin Cup, Moscow, Russia\nZurich Open, Zürich, Switzerland"

        "text": "British Cycling (formerly the British Cycling Federation) is the main national governing body for cycle sport in Great Britain. It administers most competitive cycling in Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It represents Britain at the world body, the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) and selects national teams, including the Great Britain (GB) Cycling Team for races in Britain and abroad. , it has a total membership of 165,000.\nIt is based at the National Cycling Centre on the site of the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester.\nHistory.\nThe British Cycling Federation (BCF) was formed in 1959 at the end of an administrative dispute within the sport. The governing body since 1878 had been the National Cyclists Union (NCU). The legality of cyclists on the road had not been established and the NCU worried that all cycling could be affected by police concerns about racing. The cycling historian Bernard Thompson said: \"Events organised by clubs in the 1880s, although taking place on quiet country roads, were constantly interrupted by the police. Often horse-mounted policemen charged at racers and threw sticks into their wheels.\" The race organiser and writer, Chas Messenger, said: \"Thousands of cyclists were convicted or fined for dangerous riding, many on mere suspicion and unsupported evidence.\"\nThe NCU banned all racing on the road and insisted clubs use velodromes. A rebel organisation, eventually known as the Road Time Trials Council (RTTC), began running races of individuals competing against the clock at dawn and in secrecy, to avoid police attention. The NCU eventually accepted the RTTC and the two organisations ran the sport between them, the RTTC interested only in time-trialling and the NCU administering track races and representing Britain at meetings of the UCI.\nInfighting was sparked by the UCI's decision that world road championships from 1933 would be not individual contests but competitions in which riders started together. The NCU had never been against such races but insisted that in Britain they were on roads closed to traffic, such as airfields and motor-racing courses. It now had to select riders not on their talent against the clock but in a bunch. Selection races were held at Donington Park and Brooklands. Among the riders were some, like Percy Stallard, who believed races ought to be run on the open road. He organised a race from Llangollen to Wolverhampton, in 1942. The NCU suspended Stallard and others and they formed the British League of Racing Cyclists (BLRC). It and the NCU fought each other until they merged in 1959.\nThe British Cycling Federation.\nThe merged organisation became the British Cycling Federation. It accepted racing on the open road and controlled all competitive cycling other than time-trialling, which remained with the RTTC. Cyclo-cross was administered by the British Cyclo-Cross Association, which was linked to the BCF. The BCF was recognised by the UCI. The first officials were perceived to be drawn largely from the NCU and there was bitterness among supporters of the former BLRC that they had been betrayed.\nThe BCF had offices in central London. The first were in the headquarters of the Sports Council in Park Crescent, near Hyde Park. They subsequently moved to other London premises on Brompton Road and Upper Woburn Place, before moving out of the capital to Rockingham Road, Kettering, Northamptonshire in 1988, and finally to the velodrome in Manchester.\nThe British Cycling Federation was renamed simply British Cycling after it merged with the British Cyclo-Cross Association, the British Mountain Bike Federation, the English BMX Association and the British Cycle Speedway Council. Each is now a commission within the BCF.\nIn 1996, the BCF incurred large debts as a result of a legal dispute with Tony Doyle, who resigned from his position as President of the Federation shortly after its Board attempted to remove him. Doyle had been elected to the Presidency in late 1995 on a platform of increasing transparency and accountability in the Federation: the campaign to remove him was based on claims that he had failed to declare his role as a consultant to a company that wanted to act as the promoter for the 1996 UCI Track Cycling World Championships in Manchester. In December 1996, the report of auditors from the UK Sports Council into the Federation's finances and management found that there were serious shortcomings in its procedures for accounting and control of finances and potential conflicts of interests between board members and leading companies in the cycling sector. The board were then removed by the membership and replaced with an emergency management committee. As a result of the report, Minister for Sport Iain Sproat warned that the BCF's Sports Council grants could be withdrawn and that it could be banned from applying for Lottery money. Brian Cookson was elected as President soon afterwards: he described the organisation's situation at the time as \"close to bankruptcy, 14,000 members and falling, one Olympic gold in 76 years and not much \nelse to show. It was pretty dire\".\nInternational dominance.\nIn December 1997, British Cycling appointed Peter Keen as its Performance Director, with initial responsibility for £900,000 of funding granted by the UK Sports Council on the basis of a one-year interim World Class Performance Plan. He was chosen ahead of Steve Paulding and Paul Sherwen. Keen immediately outlined the focus of the Plan, emphasising that it would mainly be aimed at targeting track cycling due to the large number of Olympic medals on offer. He spent much of the next year developing an eight-year plan to secure longer-term funding: in January 1999 it was announced that British Cycling had secured lottery funding for six years, with an award of £2.5 million for the first year. Later that year, the GB team sprint squad took the first British sprint medal at a World Championship for 40 years at the Berlin Track Worlds.\nThe first fruits of the programme were harvested at the 2000 Summer Olympics: on the track, Team GB took two bronzes, a silver and a gold medal, the latter of which was taken by Jason Queally in the 1 km time trial. Following the Games, Keen started speaking publicly about what Britain needed to do to become the world number one nation in track cycling. The team backed up their Olympic success at the subsequent 2000 UCI Track Cycling World Championships on home ground in Manchester by winning five medals, including a first world title for Yvonne McGregor in the individual pursuit.\nFrom 2001 to the present day, British cycling has greatly improved its standing in world track cycling and is now considered a dominant force in cycling. In 2001, two key members of staff were appointed, with Dave Brailsford becoming Performance Director for the World Class Performance Programme and Heiko Salzwedel joining as National Track Manager. In July 2002 the Talent Team programme was launched, which aimed to discover new riders through working with schools: riders identified through the initiative who have enjoyed success at the highest level include Dani Rowe, Laura Kenny, Peter Kennaugh, Elinor Barker and Lizzie Deignan. After a disappointing performance at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, the squad bounced back at the Track World Championships, where they finished second in the medal table with three gold medals. That year also saw the appointment of Shane Sutton in Manchester, having previously been Welsh national coach.\nIn 2003, the first six riders joined British Cycling's new Olympic Academy for junior riders, under the leadership of Rod Ellingworth, with a budget of £100,000 for the first year. Among the first cohort were Ed Clancy and Mark Cavendish, although the latter was almost passed over due to his relatively poor performance in lab tests, with coaches Ellingworth, John Herety and Simon Lillistone lobbying Keen to include him due to his potential. The Academy used a training base in Tuscany from 2006 to 2010, and has since returned to Italy, basing itself in Montichiari since 2016. Other notable riders who participated in the Academy programme include Kennaugh, Geraint Thomas, Ian Stannard, Ben Swift and Simon Yates. That year Keen left his role, whilst continuing to work with British Cycling in a consultancy capacity until the 2004 Summer Olympics: Brailsford was appointed as his replacement.\nAt the 2004 Athens Olympics cycling events, Great Britain came third in the medal table: they took two golds, a silver and a bronze, with Bradley Wiggins taking one medal of each colour - the first British Olympian to do this in 40 years. Brailsford gave much of the credit for the team's results to the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who had started working with the squad. From 2004 to 2009, it came top of the medals tally for three out of six UCI Track Cycling World Championships.\nThe team is noted for its distinctive high performance equipment. From the early days of Keen's tenure, they worked with outside firms to produce more aerodynamic bicycles and bicycle parts. They started using their own Sport Institute bicycles in 2002, and subsequently Chris Boardman played a key role in redesigning equipment and clothing to maximise efficiency. British Cycling continues to work with NASA, McLaren Group and many other organisations to improve track speeds. In the late 2000s, the team consisted of riders as Sir Chris Hoy, Victoria Pendleton, Bradley Wiggins, and Rebecca Romero.\nThis success has continued in road racing with riders such as Nicole Cooke and Mark Cavendish. British cycling has also formed a professional cycling team with BSkyB as the main sponsor and Bradley Wiggins as the team leader and David Brailsford as the manager. In 2012, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. This was followed the next year when Chris Froome won the 2013 Tour de France. Team Sky is registered as a UCI ProTeam. Recent years have also seen British dominance in downhill mountain biking, in both the Downhill World Cup and Downhill World Championships. In 2014, all three female podium positions, and the top two male positions, in the Downhill World Championships were taken by British athletes.\nOrganisation.\nBritish Cycling administers road racing, track cycling, cyclo-cross, BMX, mountain biking (including trials riding), cycle speedway, and in Scotland, road time trials. The main exception is road time trials in England and Wales, which are administered by Cycling Time Trials, the current name of the Road Time Trials Council. Only road time-trials in England and Wales remain outside British Cycling, but Cycling Time Trials works with British Cycling to organise the time-trial national championships.\nCycling clubs or teams affiliate to British Cycling to race in British Cycling events. Adult road racing licences are graded by excellence, from fourth and lowest to first and élite. There are licences for under-18s and for women.\nBritish Cycling is a member of the European Cycling Union, the UCI and the British Olympic Association.\nSponsorship.\nBSkyB sponsored British Cycling from 2008 to 2016.\nHSBC is British Cycling's Lead Partner for the period 2017 to 2024.\nCriticism.\nIn 2017, British Cycling faced criticism from UK Sport over alleged bullying, unlawful discrimination and \"dysfunctional leadership\".\nAlso in 2017, the Guardian describes how Mark Cavendish and Bradley Wiggins feel as though they have been overlooked by British cycling when they were not selected to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. Wiggins went as far as to say that he felt that British cycling were lacking in 'someone who actually knows what they're talking about'.\nThe organisation has also been criticised during the \"Combatting Doping in Sport inquiry\" of the House of Commons, particularly in relation to the supply of fluimucil to Bradley Wiggins in 2011.\nIn 2019, 22 charges were brought against former British Cycling doctor Richard Freeman by a medical tribunal which include lying to colleagues and the UK Anti-Doping Agency.\nIn 2022, British Cycling suspended its 'Transgender and Non-Binary Participation policy' to conform with the requirements of the UCI, resulting in transgender cyclist Emily Bridges being ineligible for the British National Madison Championships. The suspension of the policy lead to a sponsor of the Women's CiCLE Classic to withdraw in protest.\nIn September 2022, British Cycling faced widespread ridicule after issuing guidance that following the death of Queen Elizabeth II that cyclists should avoid cycling during \nthe funeral \"out of respect\"; British Cycling subsequently amended its position after a widespread backlash.\nIn October 2022, British Cycling faced a barrage of criticism on the announcement that it would be entering into a major partnership with the oil company Shell, with Greenpeace calling it \"brazen sportswashing\".\nRegional bodies.\nIn Scotland and Wales, British Cycling operates with regional bodies: Scottish Cycling (Scottish Cyclists' Union) and Welsh Cycling (Welsh Cycling Union). Scotland and Wales run national teams.\nThere is no regional body for England. England is not recognised as a region by the UCI, and there is no English cycling team outside the Commonwealth Games. For those occasions, British Cycling selects and supports the England team. Cycling is represented on the Isle of Man by the Isle of Man Cycling Association.\nCycling in Northern Ireland is organised under Cycling Ulster, part of the all-Ireland governing body Cycling Ireland. Until 2006, a rival governing body existed, the Northern Ireland Cycling Federation. It was affiliated to British Cycling, causing friction between the British body and the international federation, the UCI.\nBritish overseas territories.\nBritish Cycling represents the cycling associations of British overseas territories in the UCI, if they are not themselves UCI members.\nThe Gibraltar Cycling Association is the regional governing body for Gibraltar.\nGreat Britain Cycling Team Olympic Programmes.\nInternational performances have improved since British Cycling began receiving National Lottery funding in the late 1990s. It won three golds in the 2002 world track championships and four in 2005. Britain won nine of 18 gold medals at the 2008 world track championships. In September 2004, British Cycling helped organise the Tour of Britain, a five-day race finishing in London.\nOlympic Podium Programme.\nRiders in this programme are expected to be seasoned world-class performers with a track record of success at the highest level. Athletes are full-time on the programme and generally based near the team's Manchester HQ. Athletes may also be members of professional (trade) teams, receiving additional support from the programme.\nAthletes on this programme include Olympic champions Jason Kenny, Laura Trott and Philip Hindes as well as Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins.\nOlympic Senior Academy.\nRiders aged typically 18 to 23 and exceptional athletes with the clear potential to become world-class performers. The programme aims to add the final technical polish, whilst building up training loads to those likely to be experienced by the senior elite athletes.\nOlympic Junior Academy.\nRiders aged typically 16 to 18, who are already experienced and focused on a career in professional cycling. The programme aims to add technical experience, including experience of preparing for major (junior) championships, plus conditioning. Athletes are typically still in education and focus on intense training camps, whilst still living at home.\nOlympic Development Apprentices.\nA regionally based programme aimed at finding talented young riders, typically aged 14–16 and preparing them for transition to the higher programmes.\nParalympic Team.\nAthletes competing in four disability categories, primarily in track, road-race and time-trial disciplines.\nTour de France.\nBritain has hosted stages of the Tour de France on four occasions. The 1974 Tour de France, was not particularly well received. The 1994 Tour de France also visited the UK. Due to the improved popularity of cycling, and the international achievements of British cyclists, the 2007 Tour de France and 2014 Tour de France were deemed to be a tremendous success, the latter being described by race director Christian Prudhomme, as 'the best ever!', over 4.8 million people lined the route, over a three-day period.\nBritish Cycling Hall of Fame.\nOn 17 December 2009, the names of fifty one people to be inducted into the British Cycling Hall of Fame were announced. The newly established hall of fame was created as part of British Cycling's 50th anniversary celebrations. Further names were added in 2014 and 2016\nResearch and Development.\nBritish Cycling has an active Research and Development department for developing track bikes for upcoming Olympic games. Tony Purnell is the current Head of Technology. British Cycling released a radically-original design for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo. The bike itself included a new wheel research by Hope Technology and a collaboration with Lotus Cars permitted British Cycling to adopt an original wide-stay design for the bike's frame and front forks.\nBritish Cycling has also enjoyed notable successes at previous Olympic Games, with some successes attributed to their superior bike designs. This was most notable in the 1992 Summer Olympics, where British Cycling unveiled a design later known as Lotus 108. "

        "title": "Handicap (golf)",
        "text": "A golf handicap is a numerical measure of a golfer's ability, or potential ability, that is used to enable players of different abilities to compete against one another. Better players are those with the lowest handicaps.\nHistorically, rules relating to handicaps have varied from country to country with many different systems in force around the world. Because of incompatibilities and difficulties in translating between systems, the sport's governing bodies, the USGA and The R&amp;A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new World Handicap System (WHS) which began to be introduced globally in 2020. \nHistory.\nThe earliest record of golf handicapping is thought to be from the late 17th century, in a diary kept by Thomas Kincaid, who was a student in Edinburgh, Scotland, although the word \"handicap\" would not come into use in golf until the late 19th century. The number of strokes to be given and the holes on which they would be in effect was negotiated between competing golfers prior to the start of play. According to \"The Golfer's Manual\" by Henry Brougham Farnie, examples of agreed terms included \"third-one\" (one stroke every three holes), \"half-one\" (one stroke every two holes), \"one more\" (a stroke a hole) and \"two more\" (two strokes a hole).\nDuring the late 19th century, taking the difference between the average of a golfer's best three scores during the year and par became the most widely used method of handicapping in England and Scotland. As the sport grew, so did discontent with the fairness of handicapping, with less proficient players being particularly unhappy as it was much less likely for them to play to the standard of their three-score average. Another issue was the lack of consideration in the system for the varying difficulties of different courses which meant the handicap was not very portable.\nIn an attempt to remedy the problems with a fairly basic handicap system, along with many variations of that system and other systems also being used, the authorities in Great Britain and Ireland sought to standardize. One of the first standard and equitable handicap systems was introduced by the Ladies Golf Union (LGU) in the 1890s. This was largely achieved by means of union-assigned course ratings, instead of clubs using their own. It was not until the formation of the British Golf Unions Joint Advisory Committee in 1924 that the men's game fully coordinated to create an equitable handicap system, that included a uniform course rating, throughout Great Britain and Ireland; the \"Standard Scratch Score and Handicapping Scheme\" was introduced in 1926.\nIn the United States there was a single authority governing the sport, the USGA, which made moving to a single standard handicapping scheme somewhat easier. Introduced in 1911, the first national handicap system was based on the British three-score average system. The biggest development was a \"par rating\" system that assessed the average good score of a scratch golfer on every course, which made the handicap more portable. It also made clear that a player's handicap was intended to reflect their potential rather than average play. Having initially allowed clubs to determine their own par ratings, the USGA quickly changed their minds and began assigning ratings. The USGA Handicap System has further developed through the years, with an increase in the number of scores used for handicap calculations, the introduction of Equitable Stroke Control, and improvements to the course rating system. However the most significant change was the creation of the slope rating system, which enables handicaps to allow for differences in difficulty between scratch and bogey golfers. USGA Course and Slope Ratings now form the basis of many other handicap systems.\nAs the sport grew globally, associations around the world each created or adapted their own rules relating to handicaps. By the early 21st century, there were six major recognized handicapping systems in operation around the world: USGA Handicap System, EGA Handicap System, CONGU Unified Handicap System, Golf Australia Handicap System, South African Handicap System, and Argentinian Handicap System. While these systems share some common features, e.g. most use a common course rating system, they are not easily portable because their differences create difficulties in converting handicaps between systems. In order to eliminate these problems the USGA and The R&amp;A, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new \"World Handicap System\" which was phased in globally in 2020.\nOverview.\nAmateur golfers who are members of golf clubs are generally eligible for official handicaps on payment of the prevailing regional and national association annual fees. Official handicaps are administered by golf clubs with the associations often providing additional peer reviewing for low handicaps. Other systems, often free of charge, are available to golfers who are ineligible for official handicaps. Handicap systems are not generally used in professional golf. A golfer whose handicap is zero is referred to as a scratch golfer, and one whose handicap is approximately 18 as a bogey golfer.\nWhile the USGA administers its own handicapping system, the administration of handicapping systems in countries affiliated to The R&amp;A is the responsibility of the national golf associations of those countries. These bodies have different methods of producing handicaps but they are all generally based on calculating an individual player's playing ability from their recent history of rounds. Therefore, a handicap is not fixed but is regularly adjusted to increases or decreases in a player's scoring. Some systems (e.g. World Handicap System, USGA, European Golf Association) involve calculation of a playing handicap which is dependent on the course being played and set of tees that are being used, whereas others (e.g. CONGU's Unified Handicap System) just use the allocated handicap rounded to the nearest whole number.\nContrary to popular opinion, a player's handicap is intended to reflect a player's potential or \"average best\", not a player's overall average score. Statistically, low handicappers will play to their handicap more often because they are likely to be more consistent than higher handicappers.\nFeatures of handicapping systems.\nScoring.\nThe total number of strokes taken for a hole (or round) before accounting for a golfer's handicap is called the \"gross score\" for that hole (or round), and the number of strokes taken after subtracting any handicap allowance is called the \"net score\". \nNote that the \"gross score\" in 'world handicap system' is calculated as the number of strokes taken for a hole \"+ the handicap allowance for that hole\". The \"adjusted gross score\" in 'world handicap system' is the \"gross score\" adjusted such that the maximum on any particular hole is the number of strokes taken for a hole + the handicap allowance for that hole + 2 strokes (i.e. net double bogey). \nIn handicap stroke play competitions, a golfer's playing handicap is subtracted from the total number of strokes taken to produce a net score, which is then used to determine the final results. In handicap Stableford competitions, a player's handicap is distributed according to predetermined hole ratings (stroke index) and strokes deducted accordingly from each hole score before calculating the points for that hole. In match play, the handicap difference between players (or teams) is used to determine the number of strokes the high handicap player should receive from the low handicapper during the playing of their round; each of these strokes are received on the lowest numbered stroke index holes. Stroke allowances may sometimes be reduced by a set percentage in order to maintain the level playing field; this is especially common in pairs and team competitions.\nCourse Rating.\nCourse Rating, (Standard) Scratch Score, Scratch Rating, and Standard Rating are largely equivalent ratings that are used to indicate the average \"good score\" by a scratch golfer for a set of tees on a golf course. For a par 72 course, the course rating is generally between 67 and 77. There are different methods of calculating the Course Rating, with the length of the course and its obstacles being the biggest factors. Some systems use only these two, or even length alone, but most modern handicapping systems now use the \"USGA Course Rating\" system which assesses the difficulty of all aspects of the course, e.g. altitude, wide or narrow fairways, length of any rough, the size and contours of the greens, etc.\nSome handicapping systems provide for an adjustment to the course rating to account for variations in playing conditions on any given day, e.g. course setup and weather, and it is against this adjusted rating that handicaps are assessed and maintained. Examples of adjusted ratings are Playing Conditions Calculation (World Handicap System), Competition Scratch Score (CONGU Unified Handicapping System), Daily Scratch Rating (Golf Australia Handicap System), and Calculated Rating (South African Handicap System).\nAnalogous to course rating is the bogey rating, which is a measure of the playing difficulty of a course for a bogey golfer.\nSlope Rating.\nDevised by the USGA, the Slope Rating of a golf course describes the relative difficulty of a course for a bogey golfer compared to a scratch golfer. Slope Ratings are in the range 55 to 155, with a course of standard relative difficulty having a rating of 113; the higher the number, the more relatively difficult the course is.\nPlaying or course handicap.\nIn most major handicapping systems, a golfer does not use their exact handicap (or handicap index) directly, but use it to produce their playing or course handicap. For some systems, this means simply rounding the exact handicap to the nearest whole number; however, systems that use slope ratings require a more complex calculation to produce a course handicap with some also factoring in the course rating:\nor\nThe USGA and Golf Australia systems use the first calculation; the WHS, EGA, and Golf RSA systems use the second. Under CONGU's Unified Handicapping System the exact handicap is rounded to the nearest whole number to produce the playing handicap, and in the Argentinian system the exact handicap is used directly.\nA playing handicap may also refer to the stroke allowance for a given competition dependent on playing format, and is generally calculated as a percentage of the course handicap.\nStroke Index.\nThe Stroke Index is a number that has been assigned to each hole on a golf course, and usually printed on the scorecard, to indicate on which holes handicap strokes should be applied. On an 18-hole course, each hole is assigned a different number from 1 to 18 (1 to 9 on a 9-hole course). The lowest numbers are usually given to the holes where a higher handicapper is most likely to benefit, and the highest numbers to the holes they are least likely to benefit. Odd numbers will be allocated to either the first or second 9-holes (and even numbers to the other) to ensure a balanced distribution of handicap strokes, and guidelines generally recommend avoiding having the lowest numbers at the start or end of each nine in order to prevent early stroke allowances in playoffs between golfers with similar handicaps or strokes going unused if they are at the end.\nMaximum hole score.\nMost of the commonly used handicap systems seek to reduce the impact of very high scores on one or more individual holes on the calculation and updating of handicaps. This is achieved by setting a maximum score on each hole, which is only used for handicapping purposes; i.e. it is not used for determining results of competitions or matches. This \"maximum hole score\" is either a fixed number or a net score relative to par. \"Equitable Stroke Control\" (ESC) and \"net double bogey\" (also called Stableford Points Adjustments) are the two most common mechanisms for defining a maximum hole score.\nHandicap differential.\nHandicap (or score) differentials are a feature of many handicapping systems. They are a standardized measure of a golfers performance, adjusted to take account of the course being played. Normally the overall score will be adjusted prior to the calculation, e.g. by means of ESC or net double bogey. The course rating may also be adjusted to take account of conditions on the day.\nFor handicapping systems that use course and slope ratings, a typical calculation using the \"score\" (see above) is as follows:\nThe differentials are used both to calculate initial handicaps and maintain existing ones, by taking a mean average of a set number of the best recent differentials (e.g. the USGA system uses the best 10 differentials from the last 20 scores).\nFor other handicapping systems, the differentials are simply the difference between the (adjusted) gross or net scores and a specified standard rating (e.g. course rating, standard scratch score, etc.), and they are used in different ways to maintain handicaps.\nPeer review.\nIn golf clubs, peer review is usually managed by an elected Handicap Secretary who, supported by a small committee, conducts an Annual Review of the handicaps of all members and assesses ad hoc requests from individual members (usually when age or medium to long-term infirmity affects their playing ability). This gives uniformity to handicapping across their club for the setting and maintenance of handicaps with the objective of establishing fair competition between golfers of all abilities.\nAt the regional level, peer review is extended to include rigorous validation of the handicap returns of low handicap golfers. This ensures that only golfers of an appropriate standard gain entry to their elite tournaments. Occasionally, golfers are excluded from the elite game as a consequence of being found to abuse the system. To a degree, these regional bodies also monitor the performance of and provide training for Handicap Secretaries at the club level.\nNationally, the peer review is extended further to assessing golfers from external jurisdictions for their suitability for entry into their elite international events. They also play a large part in periodic reviews of the handicapping system itself to improve it for the future.\nHandicapping systems.\nWorld Handicap System.\nDue to the many different handicapping systems in use around the world, and the many inconsistencies within them, which makes it difficult to compete on an equal footing where another handicap system is in use, the sports major governing bodies, in 2011 The R&amp;A and the USGA began work on creation of a single uniform handicapping system to be used everywhere. In February 2018, they announced that the World Handicap System (WHS) would be launched in 2020. Once introduced, the World Handicap System will continue to be governed by The R&amp;A and the USGA with the six existing major handicapping authorities (the USGA, the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) in Great Britain and Ireland, the European Golf Association (EGA), Golf Australia, the South African Golf Association (SAGA), and the Argentine Golf Association (AAG)) administering the system at a local level.\nThe WHS is based on the USGA Course and Slope Rating system, and largely follows the USGA Handicap System while also incorporating features from the six major existing handicap systems. For example, 8 differentials (like the Golf Australia system) are used after net double bogey adjustments (like the CONGU and EGA systems) for handicap calculations, and the WHS course/playing handicap includes a course rating adjustment (like the EGA system). For players with current handicaps, their handicap records in the old systems will be used to produce WHS handicaps; the expectation is that most players will at most see a difference of one or two strokes, if any.\nA new WHS handicap requires several scores to be submitted; the recommendation is a minimum of 54 holes made up of any number of 9 or 18-hole rounds in order to achieve a reasonable fair and accurate result, although handicaps may be issued from a smaller sample. Handicap adjustments will be made upon submission of any 9 or 18-hole scores with updates published daily; unlike some other systems both competitive and recreational rounds may be submitted by all players (e.g. CONGU's Unified Handicapping System only allows submission of non-qualifying scores by golfers in Category 2 or above). Ongoing handicaps are based on the average of the best 8 differentials, but with an \"anchor\" to prevent rapid increases that would not necessarily reflect the player's true potential. There is also a hole limit of \"net double bogey\" for handicapping purposes in order to prevent one or two bad holes from having a disproportionate effect.\nWorld Handicap System overview.\nA WHS handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that approximates how many strokes above or below par a player might be able to play, based on the eight best scores of their last twenty rounds. The calculation has several variables, including: the player's scores from their most recent rounds, the course rating, and the slope rating.\nA score differential is calculated from each of the scores after any net double bogey adjustments (an adjustment which allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player's course handicap) have been applied, using the following formula:\nOnly 18-hole differentials are used for the calculation of a handicap index. As such, 9-hole differentials need to be combined before being used, subject to remaining one of the 20 most recent differentials. The system also allows for situations where less than 18 (or 9) hole have been played, subject to a minimum of 14 (or 7) holes having been completed, by \"scaling up\" with net pars for any missing holes.\nThe score differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the best 8 from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged and rounded to one decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are calculated from a minimum of five scores using adjustments that limit each hole score to a maximum of formula_6. If there are at least 5 but fewer than 20 qualifying scores available, the handicap index is calculated using a set number or differentials according to how many scores are available, with an additional adjustment made to that average in some circumstances.\nThe basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result rounded to one decimal place:\nThe handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set of tees being used with an adjustment based on the difference between the course rating and par. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number. For competitions, the unrounded course handicap is converted to a playing handicap by applying a handicap allowance, dependent on the format of play.\nThe WHS contains measures reduce a handicap index more quickly in the case of exceptional scoring, and also to prevent a handicap index from rising too quickly. This is done by means of \"soft\" and \"hard\" caps based on the lowest index during the previous 365 days; the soft cap reduces increases above 3.0 to 50%, and the hard cap limits increases to 5.0. Updates to a golfer's handicap index are issued daily.\nMany elements of WHS have flexibility which allows for local authorities to determine their own settings, but the basic handicap index calculation remains the same. Examples include: 9-hole scores may be scaled-up rather than combined; formula_10 may be omitted from the course handicap calculation; and the rounded course handicap may be used in the playing handicap calculation.\nUSGA Handicap System.\nThe first handicap system to be introduced by the USGA was largely the work of Leighton Calkins, who based it on the British \"three-score average\" system where the handicap was calculated as the average of the best three scores to par in the last year. The key difference was the introduction of a par rating (later known as course rating), which was based on the ability of leading amateur Jerome Travers, to account for variances in the playing difficulty of different courses. After initially allowing clubs to determine their own ratings, at the behest of Calkins the USGA quickly began assigning ratings centrally. Course ratings were rounded to the nearest whole number until 1967, when they started being given to one decimal place.\nIn 1947, the number of scores used to calculate handicaps was increased to the best 10 from all scores ever recorded subject to a minimum of 50. However this was not uniformly implemented, with regional associations disagreeing on the total number of rounds to be considered. In 1958, the USGA specified that the best 10 from 25 scores would be used. This was reduced to 10 from 20 in 1967, which remains to this day although a further adjustment was made with the introduction of a \"Bonus of Excellence\" multiplier to equalize handicaps and give better players a marginal advantage. Originally 85%, the multiplier was changed to 96% after being seen to favor better players too heavily. In 1974, Equitable Stroke Control was adopted in order to eliminate the effect of very high individual hole scores on handicap calculations.\nWith the system still not accounting for variances in playing difficulty for golfers of different abilities, in 1979 the USGA set to work on how to address the issue with the creation of the Handicap Research Team. The result of their work was the creation of what is now the Slope system. Slope was gradually introduced, firstly in Colorado in 1982, before being implemented nationally from 1987. The USGA then set about making further refinements to the course rating system, which at the time was still largely dependent on length, to take account of many other factors affecting scoring ability for a scratch golfer. The USGA Course and Slope Rating system is now used by most of the world's major handicapping systems.\nThe USGA Handicap System is used throughout the jurisdiction of the USGA (i.e. the United States and Mexico), and is also licensed for use in many other countries around the world, e.g. Canada. The USGA has often resorted to the courts to protect the integrity of its handicap system. In one such case, the California Court of Appeal (First District) summarized the system's history:\nUSGA Handicap System overview.\nA USGA handicap is calculated with a specific arithmetic formula that approximates how many strokes above or below par a player might be able to play, based on the ten best scores of their last twenty rounds. The calculation has several variables: the player's scores from their most recent rounds, and the course and slope ratings from those rounds.\nA handicap differential is calculated from each of the scores after Equitable Stroke Control (ESC), an adjustment which allows for a maximum number of strokes per hole based on the player's course handicap, has been applied using the following formula:\nThe handicap differentials are rounded to one decimal place, and the best 10 from the last 20 submitted scores are then averaged, before being multiplied by 0.96 (the \"bonus of excellence\") and truncated to one decimal place to produce the handicap index. Initial handicaps are calculated from a minimum of five scores using ESC adjustments based on the course handicap corresponding to a handicap index of 36.4 for men or 40.4 for women. If there are at least 5 but fewer than 20 qualifying scores available, the handicap index is calculated using a set number or differentials according to how many scores are available.\nThe basic formula for calculating the handicap index is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result truncated to one decimal place:\nThe handicap index is not used directly for playing purposes, but used to calculate a course handicap according to the slope rating of the set of tees being used. The result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\nUpdates to a golfer's handicap index are issued periodically, generally once or twice per month depending on the local state and regional golf associations.\nCONGU Unified Handicapping System.\nFollowing a meeting of the four men's golf unions of Great Britain and Ireland in York arranged by The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1924, the British Golf Unions Joint Advisory Committee (later Council of National Golf Unions) was formed. The organization was tasked with creating a handicapping system that would be equitable to golfers of varying ability, and as a result the Standard Scratch Score and Handicapping Scheme was devised. The system was introduced in 1926, and used a \"scratch score\" system to rate courses, taking account that courses may play easier or more difficult than par.\nA new system was introduced in 1983, which incorporated features of the Australian system. This was further revised in 1989 with the introduction of the \"Competition Scratch Score\" (CSS), an adjustment to the \"Standard Scratch Score\" (SSS), to take account of variances in course conditions (setup, weather, etc.) on a given day. Further significant changes came in 1993 (buffer zones) and 1997 (Stableford Points Adjustment). In 2002, the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU) and the Ladies' Golf Union (LGU) began working together (the LGU had adopted a system similar to that of CONGU in 1998) and in February 2004 the Unified Handicapping System (UHS) came into force.\nThe Unified Handicapping System is used to manage handicaps for both men and women who are members of affiliated golf clubs in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The system is published by CONGU and administered by each of the individual unions on behalf of their members, with handicaps being managed locally by someone at each club; this person normally holds the position of competitions or handicap secretary.\nUnified Handicapping System overview.\nUnder the Unified Handicapping System, initial handicaps are allocated based on returned scores from 54 holes, usually three 18-hole rounds. The number of strokes taken on each hole is adjusted to maximum of double the par of the hole before adding up the scores; adjustments were previously 2 over par for men and 3 over par for women. The best of the \"adjusted gross differentials\" (AGD) between the adjusted score and the Standard Scratch Score (SSS) is taken to calculate the initial handicap using the following formula, with the result truncated to give a whole number:\nAdjustments may be made to the initial handicap should it be deemed necessary to ensure it is reasonably fair. Handicaps are given to one decimal place and divided into categories with the lowest handicaps being in Category 1. Prior to 2018, the highest handicaps were in Category 4 for men, with a maximum of 28.0, and Category 5 for women, with a maximum of 36.0, with provision for higher \"club\" or \"disability\" handicaps up to a limit of 54.0 for those who cannot play to these lower limits. In 2018, handicap limits were standardized at 54.0 and a Category 5 was introduced for men, and a new Category 6 for all, replacing the club and disability category (see table below). The exact handicap is rounded to the nearest whole number to give the playing handicap. Many handicap competitions still have maximum limits of 28 for men and 36 for women.\nFor all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a players exact handicap based on the Competition Scratch Score (CSS). All hole scores are first adjusted to a maximum of net 2-over par with handicap strokes being used per the stroke index published on the scorecard; this is called Stableford or net double-bogey adjustment. Every stroke the adjusted net score is below the CSS triggers a reduction dependent on the players handicap category; for Category 1 this is 0.1 per stroke, for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should the adjusted net score exceed the CSS , there is a \"buffer zone\" equivalent to the handicap category before a 0.1 increase is applied, which is the same for all categories; for Category 1 there is 1 stroke buffer, for Category 2 it is 2 strokes, etc. The Competition Scratch Score is an adjustment to the Standard Scratch Score computed from all scores returned and is in the range formula_16 to formula_17 with provision for \"reduction only\" when scoring conditions have proved especially difficult.\nIn addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2 and above may also submit a number of \"supplementary scores\" in order to maintain their handicap; primarily a feature to accommodate golfers who play in few competitions and allow them to maintain current handicaps, it is also used by people who wish to try and get their handicap down while they are playing well. There are other mechanisms in the system to reduce or increase handicaps more quickly. Every year all handicaps are reviewed and adjusted if necessary to ensure they remain fair and accurate. In addition, any very good scores are monitored throughout the year and an \"exceptional scoring reduction\" may be applied if certain triggers are reached.\nHistorically calculating the CSS and any handicap adjustments was done manually by means of published tables, but this is now computerized with handicaps being published to a Centralised Database of Handicaps (CDH).\nEGA Handicap System.\nThe EGA Handicap System is the European Golf Association's method of evaluating golf abilities so that players of different standards can compete in handicap events on equal terms. It is based on Stableford scoring and has some similarities to both the CONGU system, with regards to handicap categories and adjustments, and to the USGA system, with regards to the use of course and slope ratings and calculating playing handicaps. The first version of the system was introduced in 2000.\nEGA Handicap System overview.\nUnder the EGA Handicap System, initial handicaps require just a single 9 or 18-hole score recorded using the maximum handicap of 54. The handicap is then calculated from the number of Stableford points scored.\nEGA handicaps are given to one decimal place and divided into categories, with the lowest handicaps being in Category 1 and the highest in Category 6 (see table below). The handicap is not used directly for playing purposes and a calculation must be done to determine a \"playing handicap\" specific to the course being played and set of tees being used. For handicaps in categories 1 to 5, the formula is as follows with the result rounded to the nearest whole number:\nAnd for category 6 a \"playing handicap differential\" is used, which is equal to the playing handicap for a handicap index of 36.0:\nFor all qualifying scores that are returned, adjustments are made to a players handicap index. All scores are first converted into Stableford points if necessary (i.e. rounds played using another scoring method, e.g. stroke play), effectively applying a net double bogey adjustment, and then for every point scored above the \"buffer zone\" there is a reduction applied to the players handicap index according to their handicap category; for Category 1 this is 0.1 per point, for Category 2 it is 0.2, etc. Should the number of points scored be below the buffer zone, a fixed increase of 0.1 is applied to the handicap index regardless of category. The EGA system also takes account of variations in playing difficulty on any given competition day by means of a \"Computed Buffer Adjustment\" (CBA) which adjusts the buffer zones by between −1 and +2 with provision for \"reductions only\" when scoring is especially difficult. The CBA replaced the previous Competition Stableford Adjustment method, which adjusted player's Stableford scores directly, in 2013.\nIn addition to playing in qualifying competitions, golfers in Category 2 and above may also submit a number of \"extra day scores\" in order to maintain their handicap. Handicaps are also reviewed annually and any necessary adjustments made.\nGolf Australia Handicap System.\nThe Golf Australia Handicap System is maintained on GOLF Link, which was a world-first computerized handicapping system developed by Golf Australia's predecessor, the Australian Golf Union (AGU) in the 1990s. When GOLF Link was first introduced it contained two key characteristics that set it apart from other world handicapping systems at the time:\nIn April 2010 GA adopted the USGA calculation method using the average of the best 10 differentials of the player's past 20 total rounds, multiplied by 0.96. In September 2011 this was altered to the best 8 out of 20 rounds, multiplied by 0.93. The reasons for these changes were cited to restore equity between high and low handicaps. An ‘anchor' so that handicaps could not increase by more than 5 in a rolling 12-month period, slope ratings, and a more sophisticated version of CCR called the Daily Scratch Rating (DSR) were implemented on January 23, 2014.\nGA Handicap System overview.\nThe GA Handicap System is based on the Stableford scoring system, and uses slope and course rating (called \"Scratch Rating\"). For handicapping purposes, the scratch rating is adjusted to reflect scoring conditions (\"Daily Scratch Rating\"), and all scores are converted into Stableford points, called the Stableford Handicap Adjustment (SHA) and inherently applying net double bogey adjustments, regardless of the scoring system being used while playing.\nHandicaps are calculated from the best 8 adjusted differentials, called \"sloped played to\" results, from the most recent 20 scores. Should there be 3 or more but fewer than 20 scores available, a specified number of \"sloped played to\" results are used, per the table below.\nNew handicaps require 3 18-hole scores to be submitted (or any combination of 9 and 18-hole scores totaling 54 holes played) using a \"Temporary Daily Handicap\" of 36 for men or 45 for women in order to calculate the necessary \"sloped played to\" results. \"Sloped played to\" results are calculated using the following formula and rounded to one decimal place:\nTo calculate the GA handicap, the \"sloped played to\" results are averaged and multiplied by a factor of 0.93, which is intended to equalize the handicap in favor of better players. The formula for calculating a GA handicap is as follows (where formula_7 is the number of differentials to use), with the result truncated to one decimal place:\nThe GA handicap is used to create a \"daily handicap\", specific to the course and set of tees being used, using the following formula with the result rounded to the nearest whole number:\nSouth African Handicap System.\nBefore 2018, the South African Handicap System used a propriety course rating system without slope, called Standard Rating, which included specific calculations for length and altitude. Handicaps were calculated using the best 10 from the last 20 differentials, with differentials derived by means of a simple (Standard Rating − Adjusted Gross) formula. The system previously calculated handicaps against an adjusted Standard Rating (called Calculated Rating) but this was suspended in 2012. Playing handicaps were simply the exact handicap, rounded to the nearest whole number.\nIn September 2018, the renamed GolfRSA Handicap System adopted the USGA Course and Slope Rating system. This necessitated a few additional changes (e.g. playing handicap and differential calculations), but the system retained all other features (e.g. Adjusted Gross and no daily course rating adjustment). The playing handicap under the GolfRSA system includes the difference between the Course Rating and Par.\nIn October 2019, further changes were made which brought the GolfRSA Handicap System further into line with the upcoming World Handicap System. The changes introduced included reducing the number of differentials used in handicap calculations from 10 down to 8, net double bogey as the maximum score per hole, reducing the minimum number of valid 18-hole scores required for handicapping to three, and exceptional scoring reductions.\nArgentinian Handicap System.\nThe Argentine Golf Association (AAG) handicapping system is a relatively simple one, using only a course rating, without slope. New handicaps require the submission of scorecards from five 18-hole rounds (or ten 9-hole rounds). An initial handicap of 25 is normally used as a starting point, which is then adjusted based on the submitted scores. Handicaps are updated once every month, with current handicaps generated from a lookup table using the average of the best eight differentials from the last 16 rounds. Golfers simply use their exact handicap for playing purposes.\nOther systems.\nFor the handicapping of golfers who are ineligible for an official handicap, some system options are available:\nPeoria System.\nThe \"Peoria System\" was designed for the handicapping of all players competing in an event such as a \"charity\" or \"corporate\" golf day. Before play commences, the organisers secretly select 6 holes (in readiness for handicapping purposes later) from the course to be played. When players have completed their rounds, they apply the \"Peoria\" algorithm to their scores on the selected holes to determine their handicap for that round. They then subtract that handicap from their gross score to give their net score - and the winner is determined in the usual way.\nCallaway System.\nThe \"Callaway System\" was designed with the same objective as \"Peoria\". The \"Callaway\" handicapping algorithm works by totaling a variable number of \"worst\" scores achieved (subject to a double-par limit) according to a simple table. A couple of adjustments are then made to this total to give the player's handicap, which is then applied to their gross score as normal.\nScheid System.\nThe \"Scheid System\" is similar to the Callaway System, except a different version of the table is used.\nSystem 36.\n\"System 36\" is a same-day handicapping system similar in function to \"Callaway System\" and \"Peoria System\". Throughout the round, the golfer accrues points based on the following formula:\nAt the end of the round, points earned are tallied. The total is subtracted from 36, and the resulting number is the golfer's handicap allowance. The golfer's net score can then be computed using their System 36 handicap allowance."

        "title": "Snake skeleton",
        "text": "A snake skeleton consists primarily of the skull, vertebrae, and ribs, with only vestigial remnants of the limbs.\nSkull.\nThe skull of a snake is a very complex structure, with numerous joints to allow the snake to swallow prey far larger than its head.\nThe typical snake skull has a solidly ossified braincase, with the separate frontal bones and the united parietal bones extending downward to the basisphenoid, which is large and extends forward into a rostrum extending to the ethmoidal region. The nose is less ossified, and the paired nasal bones are often attached only at their base. The occipital condyle is either trilobate and formed by the basioccipital and the exoccipitals, or a simple knob formed by the basioccipital; the supraoccipital is excluded from the foramen magnum. The basioccipital may bear a \ncurved ventral process or hypapophysis in the vipers.\nThe prefrontal bone is situated, on each side, between the frontal bone and the maxilla, and may or may not be in contact with the nasal bone.\nThe postfrontal bone, usually present, borders the orbit behind, rarely also above, and in the pythons a supraorbital bone is intercalated between it and the prefrontal bone.\nThe premaxillary bone is single and small and as a rule, connected with the maxillary only by ligament.\nThe paired vomer is narrow.\nThe palatine bone and pterygoid are long and parallel to the axis of the skull, the latter diverging behind and extending to the quadrate or to the articular extremity of the mandible; the pterygoid is connected with the maxillary by the ectopterygoid or transverse bone, which may be very long, and the maxillary often emits a process towards the palatine, the latter bone being usually produced inwards and upwards towards the anterior extremity of the basisphenoid.\nThe quadrate is usually large and elongate, and attached to the cranium through the supratemporal (often regarded as the squamosal).\nIn rare cases, (\"Polemon\") the transverse bone is forked and articulates with the two branches of the maxilla.\nThe quadrate and maxillary and palatopterygoid arches are more or less movable to allow for the distension required by the passage of prey, often much exceeding the size of the mouth. For the same reason, the rami of the lower jaw, which consist of dentary, splenial, angular, and articular elements, with the addition of a coronoid in the boas and a few other small families, are connected at the symphysis by a very extensible elastic ligament.\nThe hyoid apparatus is reduced to a pair of cartilaginous filaments situated below the trachea, and united in front.\nThere are various modifications according to the genera. A large hole may be present between the frontal bones and the basisphenoid (\"Psammophis\", \"Coelopeltis\"); the maxillary may be much abbreviated and movable vertically, as in the Viperidae; the pterygoids may taper and converge posteriorly, without any connection with the quadrate, as in the Amblycephalidae; the supratemporal may be much reduced, and wedged in between the adjacent bones of the cranium; the quadrate may be short or extremely large; the prefrontals may join in a median suture in front of the frontals; the dentary may be freely movable, and detached from the articular posteriorly.\nThe deviation from the normal type is much greater still when we consider the degraded wormlike members of the families Typhlopidae and Glauconiidae, in which the skull is very compact and the maxillary much reduced. In the former this bone is loosely attached to the lower aspect of the cranium; in the latter, it borders the mouth and is suturally joined to the premaxillary and the prefrontal. Both the transverse bone and the supratemporal are absent, but the coronoid element is present in the mandible.\nSnake dentition.\nIn most snakes, teeth are located on the dentary of the lower jaw, the maxilla, the palatine bone and the lateral pterygoid plate. The latter form an \"inner row\" of teeth that can move separately from the rest of the jaws and are used to help \"walk\" the jaws over prey. Several snake lineages have evolved venom which is typically delivered by specialized teeth called fangs located on the maxilla.\nMost snakes can be placed into one of four groups, based on their teeth, which correlate strongly with venom and lineage.\nAglyph.\nAglyphous snakes (\"lacking grooves\") have no specialized teeth; each tooth is similar in shape and often size. When teeth vary in size, as in some bird eaters, they do not vary in shape. Most aglyphous snakes are non-venomous; some, like \"Thamnophis\", are considered mildly venomous. The feature is not a synapomorphy.\nOpisthoglyph.\nOpisthoglyphous (\"rearward grooves\") snakes possess venom injected by a pair of enlarged teeth at the back of the maxillae, which normally angle backward and are grooved to channel venom into the puncture. Since these fangs are not located at the front of the mouth, this arrangement is vernacularly called \"rear-fanged\". In order to envenomate prey, an opisthoglyphous snake must move the prey into the rear of its mouth and then penetrate it with its fangs, presenting difficulties with large prey although they can quickly move smaller prey into position. The opisthoglyphous dentition appears at least two times in the history of snakes. The venom of some opisthoglyphous snakes is strong enough to harm humans; notably, herpetologists Karl Schmidt and Robert Mertens were killed by a boomslang and a twig snake, respectively, after each underestimated the effects of the bite and failed to seek medical help. Opisthoglyphous snakes are found mostly in the families Colubridae and Homalopsidae. \nProteroglyph.\nProteroglyphous snakes (\"forward grooved\") have shortened maxillae bearing few teeth except for a substantially enlarged fang pointing downwards and completely folded around the venom channel, forming a hollow needle. Because the fangs are only a fraction of an inch long in even the largest species, these snakes must hang on, at least momentarily, as they inject their venom. Some spitting cobras have modified fang tips allowing them to spray venom at an attacker's eyes. This form of dentition is unique to elapids. \nSolenoglyph.\nSolenoglyphous snakes (\"pipe grooved\") have the most advanced venom delivery method of any snake. Each maxilla is reduced to a nub supporting a single hollow fang tooth. The fangs, which can be as long as half the length of the head, are folded against the roof of the mouth, pointing posteriorly. The skull has a series of interacting elements that ensure that the fangs rotate into biting position when the jaws open. Solenoglyphous snakes open their mouths almost 180 degrees, and the fangs swing into a position to allow them to penetrate deep into the prey. While solenoglyph venom is typically less toxic than that of proteroglyphs, this system allows them to deeply inject large quantities of venom. This form of dentition is unique to vipers. \nExceptions.\nA few snakes do not conform to these categories. \"Atractaspis\" is solenoglyphous but the fangs swing out sideways, allowing it to strike without opening its mouth, perhaps allowing it to hunt in small tunnels. Scolecophidia (blind burrowing snakes) typically have few teeth, often only in the upper or lower jaw.\nInformal or popular terminology.\nCommon names for the various types of snake dentition originate largely from older literature, but still are encountered in informal publications. Aglyphous snakes are commonly called fangless; opisthoglyphous snakes rear-fanged or back-fanged; and both Proteroglyphous and Solenoglyphous snakes are referred to as front-fanged.\nTaxonomic key of skull modifications.\nModifications of the skull in the European genera:\nVertebrae and ribs.\nA snake has from 175 to more than 400 vertebrae in its backbone. The means by which vertebrae are secured are twofold: either a ball and socket joint, or zygopophyses, which stick out from each vertebrae to poke rear-pointing projections from the vertebrae ahead of it. This results in a spine well-adapted to the snake's method of movement. \nThe vertebral column consists of an atlas (composed of two vertebrae) without ribs; numerous precaudal vertebrae, all of which, except the first or first three, bear long, movable, curved ribs with a small posterior tubercle at the base, the last of these ribs sometimes forked; two to ten so-called lumbar vertebrae without ribs, but with bifurcate transverse processes (lymphapophyses) enclosing the lymphatic vessels; and a number of ribless caudal vertebrae with simple transverse processes. When bifid, the ribs or transverse processes have the branches regularly superposed.\nThe centra have the usual ball and socket joint, with the nearly hemispherical or transversely elliptic condyle at the back (procoelous vertebrae), while the neural arch is provided with additional articular surfaces in the form of pre- and post-zygapophyses, broad, flattened, and overlapping, and of a pair of anterior wedge-shaped processes called zygosphene, fitting into a pair of corresponding concavities, zygantrum, just below the base of the neural spine. Thus the vertebrae of snakes articulate with each other by eight joints in addition to the cup-and-ball on the centrum, and interlock by parts reciprocally receiving and entering one another, like the mortise and tenon joints. The precaudal vertebrae have a more or less high neural spine which, as a rare exception (Xenopholis), may be expanded and plate-like above, and short or moderately long transverse processes to which the ribs are attached by a single facet. The centra of the anterior vertebrae emit more or less developed descending processes, or haemapophyses, which are sometimes continued throughout, as in \"Tropidonotus\", \"Vipera\", and \"Ancistrodon\", among European genera.\nIn the caudal region, elongate transverse processes take the place of ribs, and the haemapophyses are paired, one on each side of the haemal canal. In the rattlesnakes the seven or eight last vertebrae are enlarged and fused into one.\nVestigial limbs.\nNo living snake shows any remains of the pectoral arch, but remains of the pelvis are found in:"

Its name comes from its association with St. George's Episcopal Church at Stuyvesant Square, Manhattan. It hosted the first international cricket match in 1844, between Canada and the United States. The club was founded in 1838. Nicknamed the Dragonslayers, the SGCC set the standard of US cricket from 1838 to the Civil War. \nMost of its playing members were British-born and excluded Americans from participating in their \"English game\". The local resentment of this English social exclusivity amongst New York ball players may have been the impetus for cricket to be designated as an \"English\" game in the US, though it had been played for over a century at the time. The SGCC club traveled to Canada on several occasions in the 1850s, encouraging a touring tradition for American sports which culminated in George Parr's All England XI visiting New York, Philadelphia, and Montreal in 1859. This was the first occasion that a professional team of players in any sport had played in the United States. The All England Team of professionals played a US XXII team that included five SGCC players. \nSt George's continued its dominant New York cricket organizational role until 1876, when the founding of the New York Metropolitan league and the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club at Walker Park ushered in a new era of league cricket in New York. Its first ground was located in Midtown Manhattan off of Bloomingdale Road (now Broadway) between 30th and 31st Street. The ground was located behind the Casper Samler farmstead, which was later replaced by the Gilsey Hotel. This ground was the site of many matches, including the first international cricket match in 1844. In the 1850s, economic development in Midtown necessitated that the club move to a new ground in Harlem. This ground was known colloquially and in news articles as the \"Red House\" ground and was located between what is now 105th and 106th streets and First Avenue. The Red House ground played host to domestic competitions between teams from New York and Philadelphia, as well as international matches with Canadian teams including the 1853 match between the US and Canada. Ultimately, the team relocated to Hoboken, New Jersey. After the Civil War, St George's was slated to get a ground in Central Park before moving to Hudson City. St George's opponents included the Staten Island Cricket and Baseball Club, the Philadelphia Cricket Club, and the Toronto Cricket Club. George Wright includes a picture of St George's cricket grounds in his biography.\nGeorge Wright's older brother Harry also played for St George's team. The Wrights' father, Samuel, was the professional groundskeeper for the team and is depicted, along with his son Harry, in a famous daguerreotype holding a cricket bat while Harry holds a baseball bat."

        "title": "Interference (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, interference occurs in situations in which a person illegally changes the course of play from what is expected. Interference might be committed by players on the offense, players not currently in the game, catchers, umpires, or spectators. Each type of interference is covered differently by the rules.\nOffensive interference.\nThe most common incidence of interference occurs when a member of the offensive team physically hinders the defensive team, decreasing its chances to make an out or increasing the chance that a baserunner will advance. Whenever this \"offensive interference\" occurs, the ball becomes dead. If the interference was committed by a batter or a baserunner, that player is called out and all other runners must return to the bases they occupied at the time of the interference. If interference is committed by a runner with the obvious intent of preventing a double play, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference. If interference is committed by the batter-runner before he reaches first base with the possible intent of preventing a double play, the runner closest to scoring is called out in addition to the batter-runner. If interference is committed by a retired runner or by some other member of the offensive team, the runner who is most likely to have been put out will be called out.\nUnder Little League (LL), high school (NFHS) and college (NCAA) rules, if interference is committed by a runner with the effect of preventing a likely double play, regardless of his intent, the batter-runner will be called out in addition to the runner who committed the interference.\nAlso under NFHS rules only, all runners are required to attempt to avoid collisions. If a runner fails to do so, he is guilty of malicious contact, which is one kind of offensive interference. Malicious contact carries the additional penalty of ejection from the game. In contrast, in professional and higher amateur baseball, violent collisions can occur without any interference (or obstruction), especially when a fielder is receiving a thrown ball near a base where a runner is trying to reach. Any collision that occurs in this situation is not interference, because the fielder's action is in regard to a thrown ball. As long as such a runner's actions are related to his attempt to reach the base, he cannot be called for interference. The most common case of this is when a runner is attempting to score and the catcher has control of the ball. If the catcher is in the path between third base and home plate, the baserunner may strike the catcher with his body in an attempt to dislodge the ball from the catcher's hand and then reach home plate. This is usually attempted only when the play is close. When the catcher is set up and ready, the runner has little chance of knocking the ball away. Any such attempt presents a significant chance of injury to the baserunner, which has prompted the malicious contact rule to be used more often.\nIn addition to the general subjective definition of offensive interference, it is also interference by specific rule when:\nThere are some exceptions to the penalty for offensive interference.\nVerbal interference.\nAt some levels of play, verbal as well as physical hindrance can be called for interference. For example, if a runner or other member of the offense calls out \"foul\" on a fair ball or \"mine\" on a fly ball, he may cause the defense to react differently from how they otherwise would have, resulting in an interference call. \nSome professional leagues do not have a distinction for verbal interference or obstruction and leave it as umpire judgement. The NPB in Japan, for example, verbal interference is illegal and runners will be called out on any spoken word meant to confuse a fielder or fielders during a play. In Major League Baseball, it is left as umpire judgement.\nCases of offensive interference.\nOn October 15, 1969, in Game 4 of the 1969 World Series between the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles, Mets pinch hitter J.C. Martin attempted a tenth-inning sacrifice bunt which Orioles pitcher Pete Richert fielded; however, Richert's throw to first base hit Martin on the wrist and the ball ricocheted into right field, allowing Mets baserunner Rod Gaspar to score the winning run from second base. The Orioles protested vehemently, but although replays showed Martin ran inside the first base line, umpires ruled the play valid and no interference was called. The win gave the \"Miracle Mets\" a 3–1 lead in the series, and they closed out their championship season with a win the next day.\nAn alleged offensive interference occurred in the third game of the 1975 World Series. With a runner on first, Cincinnati Reds player Ed Armbrister laid down a sacrifice bunt. Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk attempted to field the ball and throw to second base and get the lead runner out. However, Armbrister did not immediately run to first base but instead stood essentially still in the vicinity of home plate, forcing Fisk to jump into him in order to make the throw. As a result, Fisk's throw went into center field, and the Reds ended up with runners on first and third with no outs. The Red Sox protested, saying that Armbrister interfered, but home plate umpire Larry Barnett refused to change the call. The rules at the time did not mention a batter-runner/catcher collision, but the official interpretation issued to the umpires did; there is no violation on such unintentional contact. The Red Sox lost the game, and the series.\nUmpire's interference.\nIt is \"umpire's interference\" when the umpire hinders a catcher's attempt to throw anywhere. In this case, if the catcher's direct throw retires a runner the play stands. If not, the ball is dead and all runners must return to the bases they had most recently touched before the catcher's throw.\nIt is also umpire's interference when an umpire is struck by a fair batted ball before it touches a fielder including the pitcher or passes near an infielder other than the pitcher. This can occur either because an umpire is inside the diamond or because the ball crosses 1st or 3rd base in fair territory then hooks or slices foul into the umpire positioned just outside the line behind the bag. In this case, the ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, and all other runners advance only if forced. A common example is when a batter hits a fair ball down the first base line so hard that the first base umpire can't avoid it. Even though the hit would have surely been a bases-clearing double or triple without the interference, it is only a single and runners advance no more than one base. This happened in the 1989 All-Star Game when the Pittsburgh Pirates' Bobby Bonilla led off the 9th with a scorching grounder that would have been an easy double, but it hit first base umpire Bob Engel in the legs as he tried to jump out of the way. Instead of being in scoring position down 5–3, Bonilla was forced out at 2nd the next play and the game ended on a double play.\nCatcher's interference.\n\"Catcher's interference\" is called when the catcher physically hinders the batter's opportunity to legally swing at a pitched ball. This occurs most often when a catcher squats too close to home plate, so that the batter's bat touches the catcher's mitt as the batter swings. This is most likely to happen on attempted steals where the catcher is anxious to catch the ball as soon as possible and may move his entire body or mitt forward a bit. It also more commonly happens to hitters who let pitches get deeper and take later swings, such as Jacoby Ellsbury, who holds the record for the most times interfered with by a catcher in both a single season and his career.\nIn this case, play continues, and after continuous playing action ceases, the umpire will call time. The penalty here is that the batter is awarded first base, any runner attempting to steal is awarded that base, and all other runners advance only if forced. Additionally, the catcher is charged with an error and the batter is not charged with an at-bat. However, if the actual playing result is more advantageous than the penalty, the offense may elect to ignore the infraction (e.g., if the batter-runner reaches first safely and all other runners advance at least one base, catcher's interference is ignored by rule, or if a run scores even though the play resulted in an out the offense may elect to take the play versus the penalty by appealing to the calling Umpire).\nUnder high school (NFHS) rules only, catcher's interference is instead called \"catcher's obstruction\".\nSpectator interference.\nWhen a spectator or other person not associated with one of the teams (including such staff as bat and ball boys/girls) alters play in progress, it is \"spectator interference\", colloquially called \"fan interference\". It is worth noting that the latter is also (incorrectly) used to refer to fan obstruction – for instance a spectator running onto the field and tackling a baserunner. The ball becomes dead, and the umpire will award any bases or charge any outs that, in his judgment, would have occurred without the interference.\nSuch interference often occurs when a spectator in the first row of seats reaches onto the field to attempt to grab a fair or foul fly ball. If the umpire judges that the fielder could have caught the ball over the field (i.e., the ball would have not crossed over the plane of the wall), he will rule the batter out on spectator interference. Also, the spectator who commits interference is usually ejected from the stadium. Note that spectators are allowed to catch a ball that is in play when the ball has broken the plane of the spectators' side of the wall. The area where both fielders and spectators are legally allowed to catch the ball is colloquially called \"no man's land\".\nUmpires typically grab their wrist above their head to signal that spectator interference has occurred.\nCommon misconceptions.\nWhen a fielder hinders a baserunner, the situation is called obstruction, not interference. Baseball commentators will often mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference.\nNot all physical contact in baseball is interference. Accidental contact that has little or no effect on play will usually be ignored; physical contact must result in an advantageous situation for the offense to be considered offensive interference. Nor must physical contact occur for interference to be called; a runner may interfere with a fielder simply by hindering the fielder's ability to attempt to make a play on a batted ball.\nIf a baserunner is hit by a fair batted ball while standing on a base, the runner is out, unless the ball has already passed an infielder or the infield fly rule has been declared. The base is not a sanctuary.\nHowever, being in contact with a base may protect a baserunner from being called out for interference in the case of a fielder attempting to field a batted ball.\nPer MLB rules:\n\"If [a] runner has contact with a legally occupied base when he hinders [a fielder who is attempting to make a play on a batted ball], he shall not be called out unless, in the umpire’s judgment, such hindrance, whether it occurs on fair or foul territory, is intentional. If the umpire declares the hindrance intentional, the following penalty shall apply: With less than two out, the umpire shall declare both the runner and batter out. With two out, the umpire shall declare the batter out.\"\nPer Little League rules:\n7.08—Any runner is out when –"

It was also the largest margin of defeat for the USA since the competition started in 1927.\nTelevision.\nIn the United States, live Friday coverage was provided by USA Network. Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis hosted from the 18th tower. NBC Sports presented live coverage of the Saturday and Sunday matches. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, Bob Murphy called holes, while on-course reporters were Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Ed Sneed.\nFormat.\nThe Ryder Cup is a match play event, with each match worth one point. The competition format changed slightly from used from that used from 1991 to 2002, with the order of play swapped on the second day:\nWith a total of 28 points, 14 points were required to win the Cup, and 14 points were required for the defending champion to retain the Cup.

        "text": "The Papua New Guinea national rugby league team represents Papua New Guinea in the sport of rugby league football.\nIn Papua New Guinea, Rugby League is a highly popular sport and is regarded as the country's national sport. The national side are known as the Kumuls (\"birds-of-paradise\" in Tok Pisin).\nHistory.\nRugby league in Papua New Guinea was first played in the late forties; it was introduced to the nation by Australian soldiers stationed there during and after the Second World War. Papua New Guinea were admitted to the game's International Federation in 1974. On 6 July 1975, at Lloyd Robson Oval, in Port Moresby the Kumuls played their first ever international. They were beaten 40-12 by England. The English team were en route to Australia and New Zealand to fulfil away fixtures during the 1975 World Cup.\nThey first entered the Rugby League World Cup for the 1985-88 competition, though it was not until 2000 that they won away from home. In 1987 The Kumuls staged their first full test playing tour of Britain, after playing BARLA opposition in 1979. The 1987 Tour had The Kumuls play both BARLA and for the first Professional opposition.\nOn Tuesday 20 October 1987, Cumbria met Papua New Guinea before a crowd of 3,750 at the Recreation Ground, Whitehaven. Cumbria won 22–4. Four days later Papua New Guinea played a Test which was also a World Cup match against Great Britain. They lost the test 42–0 at Central Park, Wigan.\nDuring the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia a Test match was played at Port Moresby which like the match at Wigan in 1987 was a World Cup match. Which they also lost 42-22. Later that year Papua New Guinea played a World Cup match against Australia in Wagga Wagga, the Kangaroos recording a then international record winning margin of 62 points with a 70–8 win. Australian winger Michael O'Connor crossed for four tries and kicked seven goals for a personal points haul of 30, which could have been 44 had he not missed seven kicks at goal. In 1990 Papua New Guinea played host to a touring Great Britain, the series ended in a 1–1 draw.\nOn Sunday 27 October 1991, Papua New Guinea met Wales at Vetch Field, Swansea. Roared on by a fervent crowd of 11,422; Wales won by a record 68-0 margin, scoring thirteen tries. Papua New Guinea never recovered and lost all five matches in Britain, conceding 232 points in the process, and won only one of their four matches in France.\nPapua New Guinea wound up their 1991 tour of Europe with a World Cup rated Test match against France, which was played on Sunday 24 November at the Stade Albert Domec, Carcassonne. Despite Papua New Guinea leading 8–4 at half-time; France defeated their visitors 28–14.\nThe Kumuls hosted Australia for a two test series in October 1991 (won 2-0 by the Kangaroos), and also hosted Great Britain during the 1992 Lions tour of Australasia.\nPapua New Guinea travelled to England to compete in the 1995 World Cup under coach Joe Tokam and captain Adrian Lam. In their group was Tonga and New Zealand, against whom they failed to win a match.\nIn 1996 Bob Bennett, brother of the famous Wayne Bennett, was appointed the Kumuls' coach. Also, in 1996, Adrian Lam captained the 'Papua New Guinea National Rugby League Team' against the Australian Kangaroos (52-6 win to Australia).\nBob Bennett coached the 2000 World Cup Kumuls team to the qualification two the pool were the kumuls made it into the top 4 teams in the world so the 2000 World Cup Kumuls team was rated the best kumuls team.\nThey were granted automatic qualification to the 2008 World Cup but were placed in a pool with the top three teams, Australia, New Zealand and England, and failed to win a match in the tournament.\nPNG automatically qualified for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup having reached the quarter-finals of the previous Rugby League World Cup. The 2021 tournament will take place in England.\n2010 controversy.\nThe Papua New Guinea team experienced huge difficulties leading to the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations Tournament, as politicians clashed for control over the game and the governing body, the PNGRFL, was split over issues concerning junior development, the national team and the Papua New Guinea NRL bid. This caused Adrian Lam to retire as head coach of the Kumuls in September 2010 while recently retired captain Stanley Gene, who had never coached a side before, was named his replacement. The governing board were adamant that more Papua New Guinea-based players should be in the squad, and fewer Australia-based players should be picked. In early October the squad was announced for the tournament and consisted of 12 PNG-based players with captain Paul Aiton being the only NRL player. Whilst the Australian team for the tournament was worth an estimated A$10 million, local newspapers calculated the Kumuls value at around A$670,000.\nDespite the Australian media treating the defeat of the Papua New Guinean team as a mere formality, with the team having odds of 125–1 to win the tournament, the players and journalists at home were positive that the Kumuls could make a lasting impression in the tournament. After their first up 42–0 defeat against Australia, the team's enthusiasm and crunching tackles were praised, but ball control and creativity let the team down hugely. However the team faced much more criticism after their 76-12 thrashing suffered at the hands of New Zealand, with fans angry at the poor display from the players and some questioning the credentials of new coach Stanley Gene. Days after the match a broader look at the sport in the country occurred with one assessment concluding that rugby league was poorly managed and former PNG great Marcus Bai called on clubs to supply a greater number of representative standard players especially from the New Guinea Islands region which had supplied five of this year's team. The way politics had made its way into the governing of the sport was also condemned.\n2015 Pacific Rugby League Test.\nIn May 2015, Papua New Guinea took on Fiji in the 2015 Melanesian Cup at Cbus Super Stadium. The International was part of a triple header which also included the Polynesian Cup, between Samoa and Tonga, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. The Kumuls never really troubled the Fijians after handling errors and poor decisions led to the Bati easily winning the inaugural Melanesian Cup by 22–10.\n2016 Pacific Rugby League Test.\nIn May 2016, Papua New Guinea took on Fiji in the 2016 Melanesian Cup at Pirtek Stadium. The International was part of a triple header which also included the Polynesian Cup, between Samoa and Tonga, and the Junior Kangaroos against the Junior Kiwis. In this year's test, the Kumuls had more experienced players and it paid off. Despite being in a similar situation with the half time score, they managed to make a miraculous comeback not many saw coming, to record their first win 24–22 on away shores since the 2000 World Cup.\n2017 Pacific Rugby League Test.\nThe PNG Kumuls won their second consecutive Pacific Cup test victory with a 32–22 victory over the Cook Islands at Campbelltown Stadium in Sydney, Australia.\n2017 Rugby League World Cup.\nThe PNG Kumuls won all their pool games in Port Moresby before losing to England in Melbourne in the quarter-final of the 2017 RLWC.\n2018 Pacific Rugby League Test.\nThe PNG Kumuls won their third consecutive Ox &amp; Palm Pacific Cup test victory with a 26–14 victory over Fiji Bati at Campbelltown Stadium in Sydney, Australia.\n2019 Oceania Cup and GB Lions Tour.\nThe PNG Kumuls lost both their 2019 Oceania Cup (rugby league) test matches with a 24–6 loss to Toa Samoa at Leichhardt Oval in Sydney, Australia and a 22–20 loss to Fiji Bati in Christchurch, New Zealand . The Kumuls ended the season on a high defeating the Great Britain Lions 28–10 in Port Moresby.\n2022 Pacific Rugby League Test.\nThe Kumuls defeated a full strength Fiji Bati 24-14 on June 25 at Campbelltown Stadium.\n2022 Rugby League World Cup.\nThe PNG Kumuls will be based in Warrington for the 2021 RLWC. The World Cup will be held between October 15 and November 19. Kumuls coach Stanley Tepend will be guided by his mentor/ Coaching Director Shane Flanagan. The PM's XIII lost to Australia PM's XIII on September 25 at Suncorp Stadium as part of both teams world cup preparations. The Kumuls bowed out in the quarterfinals after losing to hosts, England.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe Papua New Guinean squad selected for the 2023 Pacific Rugby League Championships.

        "text": "The Rugby League European Championship (formerly known as the European Cup and European Nations Cup) is a rugby league football tournament for European national teams that was first held in 1935.\nOriginally, the European Cup had three teams, with England, Wales and France each playing each other once. Unlike the Tri-Nations series, there was no final; the team finishing at the top of the group was deemed the winner. From 1949 to 1956, a fourth Other Nationalities team entered the European Cup.\nFrom 2003 to 2009, the tournament featured six teams, and the presence of a final. Between 2014 and 2018, the European Championship was reduced to four teams. 2020 saw a massive expansion with promotion and relegation introduced.\nHistory.\n1935–1996: Original competition.\nThe Rugby League European Championships was originally a tri-nations tournament between England, Wales, and France playing each other in a single round robin. The tournament was played annually, with the exception of the years of the Second World War. \nIn 1946–47, the tournament was altered, with each team playing each other twice, home and away. \nThe 1949–50 season saw a return to playing only once, but a new team, \"Other Nationalities\", was added. This team consisted of players who were not English, Welsh, or French playing in the British and French leagues.\nThe 1955–56 tournament had no Welsh team, though Welsh players featured for Other Nationalities.\nThe tournament was not played again until 1969–70, and not again until 1975 with the original three-team format. \nThe tournament was cancelled again after the 1981 tournament, but it was revived again under the same format for 1995 and 1996.\n2003–2009: Nations Cup era and RLEF control.\nIn 2003, the tournament was revamped under the control of the Rugby League European Federation. This saw the inclusion of Scotland, Ireland, and Russia. The tournament came with a new structure of two groups of three, with the winner of each group meeting in a final. This structure was continued for the 2004 tournament.\nFrom 2004 Scotland, Ireland, and Wales had to have at least four 'domestic based' players from their domestic competitions (in the case of Wales and Scotland this means Welsh clubs playing in the RLC Welsh Premier Division and RLC Scottish Premier) in their squad.\nThe 2005 tournament did not include England as a participant. Georgia won the first ever European Nations qualifying tournament in 2005, beating both Serbia and the Netherlands to win a spot in the tournament.\n2006 saw the introduction of a B and C tournament.\n2010–2018: European Cup era.\nThe 2010 and 2014 tournaments were used to choose the team that compete with Australia, New Zealand and England in the subsequent Four Nations. Starting in 2018, the tournament is being used as a part of the qualification process for the Rugby League World Cup.\n2020–present: Promotion and relegation era.\nThe Rugby League European Federation announced changes for the 2020 tournament with promotion and relegation between each tier of the tournament for first and last place teams respectfully. The tournament was also expanded to include a D tier as well. The 2020 European Championship was to consist of six teams with one team being relegated to Euro B. In July 2020, the 2020 edition of the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe next tournament, scheduled for 2022 but pushed back to 2023 due to the postponement of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, was also cancelled due to the late withdrawal of France hosting the 2025 Rugby League World Cup. This edition was set to feature a mass expansion of the tournament, featuring eight teams and the return of England. This edition would also see Euro C and D cancelled due to all teams moving up divisions in the expanded tournament."

        "text": "Andrés Antonio \"Tony\" González (August 28, 1936 – July 2, 2021) was a Cuban professional baseball outfielder, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Cincinnati Reds (), Philadelphia Phillies (–), San Diego Padres (), Atlanta Braves (–), and California Angels (–).\nCareer.\nA fine center fielder, González spent his best years with the Phillies. He had an average, though accurate, arm with excellent range. As a hitter, González batted for average with occasional power, drew a significant number of walks, was a good bunter, and had enough power to collect an above-average number of doubles and triples. He hit a career-high 20 home runs in ; then, in , González had career-highs in doubles (36) and triples (12), to place third and second, respectively, in the National League (NL). In , his career-high .339 batting average was second only to Roberto Clemente’s .357 for the NL batting crown, which also ranked second in the major leagues.\nIn his twelve-season MLB career, González hit .286 (1,485-for-5,195), with 103 home runs, 615 runs batted in (RBI), 690 runs, 238 doubles, 57 triples, and 79 stolen bases, in 1,559 games. Defensively, he recorded a .987 fielding percentage, while playing at all three outfield positions.\nIn the 1969 National League Championship Series against the New York Mets, González hit .357, with two RBI, one double, four runs, and one homer (off Tom Seaver). Following his big league career, González played part of the season for the Hiroshima Toyo Carp of Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nIn total, González made about 5,800 trips to the plate over his major league career (about 4,600 — or 80% — of them against right-handed pitchers and the other 1,200 — or 20% — against left-handers); so, González averaged about 400 plate appearances per year against righties and 100 plate appearances against lefties. In total, he hit .286, with a .350 on-base percentage, and a .413 slugging percentage. But what is striking about González is that he exhibited a rather pronounced platoon-split during his career — that is, being a left-handed batter, he hit right-handed pitchers much better than he hit southpaws. For his career, Gonzalez hit .303 against righties, with a .366 on-base percentage, and a .442 slugging percentage; against lefties, these numbers were only .219/.288/.299. Given that the 1960s were a time of reduced offensive output — due in part to a larger strike zone and 4-man (rather than 5-man) rotations — his performance against righties was exceptional, and if he would have had a right-handed hitting platoon-mate — that could have covered his 100 or so plate appearances against southpaws each year — González might merit consideration as one of the best hitters of the decade.\nDuring the season, González was the first MLB player to wear a batting helmet with a pre-molded ear-flap. He was in the NL top-ten in being hit by pitches, and the special helmet was constructed specifically for his use."

In 1951 he signed with the Johnstown Jets, a farm team of the Montreal Canadiens. Upon signing, Hall agreed to sign a \"C-form\", which allowed the Canadiens to own Hall's rights as a professional hockey player. During Hall's rookie season, he played against future hockey Hall of Fame forward Maurice Richard in an exhibition game on November 20, 1951 in front of 1,638 fans at the Cambria County War Memorial Arena. Although Hall did not score that night, Richard scored six goals against Ivan Walmsley, who was considered to be the Jets' standout goaltender at the time.\nHall played 754 games in eleven years with the Jets. In that time he scored 424 career goals, the second-highest total in team history, and had 641 assists and 1,056 points. At the time of his retirement, he was the all-time leading scorer in organized hockey. He made the All-Star team nine times.\nAfter retiring in 1962, Hall coached an EHL All-Star team which toured the Soviet Union. In Hall's words, their team got \"creamed\" and didn't win a game until they reached Czechoslovakia. \"They sent their best teams,\" Hall said, \"and they didn't lay down for anybody.\"\nHall's jersey number 9 was retired by the Johnstown Chiefs during the 1990-91 season, in honour of his distinguished career with the Jets. A banner commemorating his retirement hangs in the Cambria Country War Memorial Arena.\nHall resided in Johnstown, Pennsylvania with his wife, Jean. They had three children."

        "title": "Obstruction (baseball)",
        "text": "In baseball, obstruction is when a fielder illegally hinders a baserunner running within the basepath. Baserunners are generally permitted to run from base to base without being physically blocked or hindered by a fielder. The only time that a fielder is not obligated to \"get out of the way\" of a baserunner is when the fielder is fielding a hit ball or in possession of the ball.\nDefinition.\nOfficial Baseball Rule 2.00 defines obstruction as:\nThe comment to Rule 7.09(j) adds that\nHigh school and college versions of the rule also add rules against malicious or flagrant contact.\nTypes of obstruction and corresponding penalties.\nAny case of obstruction falls into one of two categories (formerly called type \"A\" and type \"B\" until the 2014 rewriting of the MLB Umpire rulebook), after the subsection of Rule 6.01(h), in which each type of obstruction, and the corresponding penalties, are described.\nIn addition, the fielder who commits the obstruction is charged with an fielding error. As with a catcher's interference call, if the obstruction allows the batter to safely reach first base, unlike other fielding errors the batter is not charged with an at bat.\nCommon misconceptions.\nThere need not be physical contact for obstruction to be called; if a fielder causes the runner to alter his normal running path, or deliberately blocks his view of the plate, he can be guilty of obstruction.\nObstruction is not the same as interference; obstruction is typically committed by a fielder against a base runner, while interference is typically committed by a base runner against a fielder, or the batter against the catcher. When a fielder hinders a base runner, baseball commentators (including the announcers of the 2013 game discussed below) will often mistakenly refer to obstruction as interference.\nNotable cases of obstruction.\nOn August 6, 2004, a game between the Seattle Mariners and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Tropicana Field ended with a Devil Rays victory on an obstruction call. With one out and the score tied 1–1 in the bottom of the tenth inning, the Devil Rays' Carl Crawford was taking a lead off of third base when teammate Tino Martinez hit a fly ball toward Mariners left fielder Raúl Ibañez. Crawford went back to third base as if he was going to consider tagging up and trying to score after the ball was caught. Mariners shortstop José López moved to a spot that was between Crawford and Ibañez. Ibañez caught the ball, and Crawford bluffed a run toward home; he then stopped and was heading back toward third base as Ibañez's throw sailed toward home plate. However, third base umpire Paul Emmel ruled that López had blocked Crawford's view of left fielder Ibañez, thus preventing Crawford from seeing when the ball was caught and when he could leave third base and head toward home plate. Emmel called obstruction on the ground that López's action, within the language of the rule, had \"impede[d] the progress of\" Crawford by not letting him see precisely when it was safe for him to leave the base. Emmel awarded Crawford home plate, and that was the winning run. The play involved \"Type A\" obstruction, as a play was being made on Crawford at the time of the obstruction because Ibañez threw the ball home to prevent him from scoring. The play also demonstrated how it is not necessary for a fielder to make physical contact with a runner or physically impede the runner's running path to be called for obstruction.\nOn October 4, 2003, in Game 3 of the 2003 American League Division Series between the Oakland A's and the Red Sox, the A's Miguel Tejada was called out after he apparently misunderstood the obstruction rule. Tejada was on second base when teammate Ramón Hernández hit a ground ball into left field for a hit. Tejada rounded third and collided with Red Sox third baseman Bill Mueller, who was trying to get into position to receive a throw from left fielder Manny Ramirez. Umpire Bill Welke called obstruction. Incorrectly thinking that the play was over and that he was entitled to home plate automatically, Tejada slowed to a jog and headed toward home. The Red Sox, however, threw the ball to catcher Jason Varitek who caught the ball long before Tejada reached home and easily tagged him out. Tejada had failed to realize that, because a play was not being made on him at the time of Mueller's obstruction, the obstruction was \"Type B\" obstruction. Therefore, under Rule 7.06(b), Welke's call was only preliminary, the ball was still live, and the play was supposed to \"proceed until no further action [was] possible,\" at which point the umpires would judge whether Tejada would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred. Tejada was called out after Varitek tagged him with the live ball because, in light of his jogging, the umpires could not say that he would have scored if the obstruction had not occurred.\nOn October 26, 2013, Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was decided by a controversial obstruction call. In the bottom of the ninth inning, Allen Craig of the St. Louis Cardinals was impeded by Boston Red Sox third-baseman Will Middlebrooks, who had fallen to the ground trying to catch a wild throw from Red Sox catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia. As a result, the third-base umpire, Jim Joyce, ruled obstruction, and thus Craig was awarded home plate and the Cardinals won the game 5–4. This play involved \"Type B\" obstruction, because no play was being made on Craig at the time that the obstruction occurred. Saltalamacchia's throw had already gone into left field before Craig tripped over Middlebrooks's body while trying to head home.\nThe difference between the play on Tejada and the play that ended Game 3 of the 2013 World Series was that, in the 2013 game, Allen Craig got up after he tripped over Middlebrooks and ran hard toward home plate, where he was tagged by catcher Saltalamacchia just before he slid into the plate. Home plate umpire Dana DeMuth then made the final call that Craig was safe because he would have scored if Middlebrooks's obstruction had not occurred.\nAccording to David Smith, baseball historian and founder of Retrosheet, as of October 2013, the 2004 and 2013 games described above were the only games that ever ended on an obstruction call.\nHistory.\nThe rule against obstruction was first formalized as part of the 1856 version of the National Association of Base Ball Players rules. The current language of the Official Rules was introduced in 1962, and modified in 2019."

        "text": "First division and second division are terms in the sport of baseball referring to rankings within a league. Teams ranked in the top half of the league standings table (e.g. the top four teams in an eight-team league) are said to be in the \"first division\", while teams in the bottom half of the standings are said to be in the \"second division\".\nThe term was once closely associated with Major League Baseball (MLB). However, since the introduction of a divisional structure by MLB in , usage of the term is now uncommon.\nWithin MLB, the New York Yankees finished in the first division for a record 39 consecutive seasons (1926–1964) while, by comparison, the Chicago Cubs once finished in the second division for 20 seasons in a row (1947–1966).\nMLB Players' Pool.\nIn MLB before 1969—the establishment of divisions within each league—players on teams finishing in the first division received monetary shares from the Players' Pool, which was funded by gate receipts from that year's World Series. The team winning the World Series received 42% of this money, the team losing the World Series got 28%, and the second-, third- and fourth-place teams in each league were awarded 7.5%, 5% and 2.5%, respectively.\nWith the realignment of both leagues into two geographically based divisions in 1969, the terms \"first division\" and \"second division\" quickly fell into disuse—largely because the word \"division\" had acquired a completely different meaning—although teams finishing in the top half of the standings (the first three teams in each of the new divisions) continued to share in the Players' Pool.\nThe distribution of the Players' Pool money was also changed with the introduction of divisional play, with the World Series winner henceforth getting 36% of the pool, its loser 27%, the losers of the League Championship Series 12.5% each, the second-place teams in the divisions 2.375% each, and the third-place teams .625% each. In 1991, these shares were revised to 36%, 24%, 12%, 3% and 1% respectively, and when both major leagues realigned again in 1995 (each league now consisting of three divisions, the winners thereof plus one wild card team in each league reaching the postseason), the 3% shares went to teams losing in the Division Series and the 1% shares went to the teams that finished second in their division but did not earn a wild card."

        "title": "Stars &amp; Stripes (America's Cup syndicate)",
        "text": "Stars &amp; Stripes (\"Team Dennis Conner\") is the name of an America's Cup syndicate operated by Dennis Conner and its racing yachts, which are among the most famous in the world. The name \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" refers to the nickname often used for the flag of the United States. TDC was registered under the flag of the San Diego Yacht Club (SDYC).\n12-metre class yachts.\nThe well funded Sail America Foundation commissioned four 12-metre yachts to support a campaign led by Dennis Conner, representing the San Diego Yacht Club, to win back the America's Cup in the 1987 competition in Fremantle, Australia.\nThe movie \"Wind\" is loosely based on Dennis Conner's experience, from the 1983 America's Cup loss to his America's Cup win in Perth, and on a number of events that occurred on various competitor boats throughout the match races of the 1987 America's Cup. For artistic reasons, the 12-metre \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\" was dramatized in the film as \"Geronimo\".\nDuring the 2017 Hurricane Irma, \"Stars &amp; Stripes 87\", the third iteration of the \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" sustained major damage in Sint Maarten. A total of five 12 meter yachts were damaged, sunk, or were dismasted. It had previously sunk, in 2002 when the rudder shaft broke while the crew was training.\nCatamaran-hull yachts.\nThe surprise challenge by Sir Michael Fay caught the San Diego Yacht Club unprepared. They initially rejected the challenge, but were compelled to respond when Mr. Fay brought the matter before the New York courts. The court's decision was handed down in November 1987, leaving little time to prepare for the 1988 challenge race.\nAs the challenge used the original Deed of Gift as its basis, the design requirements specified only that she be a single masted yacht no more than 90 feet at the waterline. The San Diego Yacht Club and Dennis Conner's syndicate chose to respond with an assuredly faster multi-hull design. Conner enlisted the help of designers Morrelli, Chance &amp; Hubbart &amp; MacLane, and aircraft manufacturer Scaled Composites. Two \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" cats were built, one with a conventional soft sail (\"Stars &amp; Stripes S1\"), and the second with a wing mast (\"Stars &amp; Stripes H3\") built by Scaled Composites. The wing masted boat proved to have superior performance, and so was used in the defense.\nTo no one's surprise, \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" dominated its match races with \"KZ 1\", the challenger from New Zealand. Following the race the New Zealand team sued and initially won the America's Cup trophy in a court case. The decision was reversed on appeal, and the San Diego Yacht Club retained the Cup.\nAfter the 1988 America's Cup, the wing masted catamaran was bought by Mexican yachtsman Victor Tapia and currently sails in Mexico. The soft sail yacht was bought by Steve Fossett and used to set speed records in various yacht races. The soft sail yacht suffered a dismasting during a Mackinac race which resulted in her being stored for several years. In 2015, Freddie Mills acquired the vessel and has re-rigged and re-commissioned her as a private racing yacht operating out of Newport, Rhode Island. In October 2017 \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" (soft sail) was acquired by Key Lime Sailing Club and Cottages in Key Largo to be used for day charters and racing.\n2008 Port Huron to Mackinac race.\nFossett's \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" yacht was entered in the 84th running of the annual Port Huron to Mackinac Boat Race to Mackinac from Port Huron, Michigan, and was favored to win and set a new record time. An experienced Chicago sailor Donald Wilson captained the yacht, chartering it from a Florida businessman for both the Port Huron and Chicago to Mackinac races. The same yacht previously competed in the 74th running of the Port Huron regatta (1998) but was unable to complete the race after the mast broke off near Alpena, Michigan. The yacht was again dismasted mid-race in heavy winds while leading a rival multihull yacht \"Earth Voyager\", which then went on to finish the race in record time.\nInternational America's Cup Class.\n1992.\nConner's 1992 IACC AC yacht, \"Stars &amp; Stripes USA-11\" lost the defender series final, the Citizen Cup, to Bill Koch's \"America3 USA-23\".\n1995.\nConner's 1995 AC yacht, \"Stars &amp; Stripes USA-34\" won the defender series, the Citizen Cup against \"Young America USA-36\" and \"Mighty Mary USA-43\", by use of tactics. However, it was considered to be the slowest of the three defending yachts, partially due to an old sail inventory, and also a result of neglecting important recommendations from the design team. The defender can choose which boat to use, so Team DC selected \"Young America\", considered the fastest defender, instead of \"Stars &amp; Stripes\" in the America's Cup final, losing to Team New Zealand. Dennis Conner did not run a two boat campaign due to cost, so there was no second \"Stars &amp; Stripes\".\n2000.\nConner again ran a one-boat campaign, entering \"Stars &amp; Stripes USA-55\". Eliminated in the semi-final repechage after an unexpected loss against \"America True\".\n2003.\nConner's $5 million 2002 entrant, \"Stars &amp; Stripes USA-77\", was sunk on July 23, 2002, when a rudder broke during preparations for the 2002–2003 races to select the challenger for the America's Cup. The boat was raised out of of water just outside Long Beach Harbor. Conner's luck that year would not improve, as \"Alinghi\" and \"Oracle BMW Racing\", two well financed boats, would contest for the spotlight. Conner had a backup and training vessel available, \"Stars &amp; Stripes USA-66\", which he raced until USA-77 could be repaired.\n2007.\nConner announced that he could not raise sufficient funds for another Cup challenge."

        "title": "Elite Ice Hockey League",
        "text": "The Elite Ice Hockey League (EIHL), sometimes referred to internationally as the British Elite League, is an ice hockey league in the United Kingdom. Formed in 2003 following the demise of the Ice Hockey Superleague, it is the highest level of ice hockey competition in the United Kingdom.\nThe league operates three competitions for members; the British Championship play-offs determine the national champion for the season, following a regular season league competition for which separate champions are also crowned, and which selects and seeds the teams in the play-offs. Finally, a stand-alone cup competition, the Challenge Cup, is also held annually including only EIHL teams, beginning with the group stages followed by a knock-out format. In effect, the play-off final, regular end-of-season table and Challenge Cup final crown the British or National Champions, the EIHL League champions and the Cup champions respectively.\nThe league currently consists of one division of ten teams, with representation from all four nations of the United Kingdom – the only league in any sport to do so. Five of the teams as of 2023 are situated in England, while the other five are spread throughout the other nations; three in Scotland, one each in Wales and Northern Ireland. In fourteen completed seasons the league championship has been won by five different teams, while the play-offs have crowned six different teams as national champions.\nA system of promotion and relegation is not operated by the Elite League; teams enter the league on the basis of a decision by the board of directors. A similar system operates in most American sports, and also in various competitions in Britain and Ireland, including the British Basketball League, the United Rugby Championship, the Netball Superleague, and The Hundred and County Championship in English and Welsh cricket.\nDespite this, other organised ice-hockey does take place in Great Britain. The level below the Elite League is the National Ice Hockey League, and historically teams have moved between the two leagues for competitive and financial reasons, by agreement of the respective leagues' management.\nInternationally, teams from the EIHL can participate in the International Ice Hockey Federation's annual Champions Hockey League (CHL), competing for the European Trophy. Participation is based on the strength of the various leagues in Europe (excluding the European/Asian Kontinental Hockey League). Going into the 2022–23 CHL season, the EIHL was ranked the No. 8 league in Europe, allowing them to send their top team to compete in the CHL.\nThe day-to-day operation of the league is overseen by a chairman (as of 2023, Tony Smith), a director of hockey operations (Michael Hicks), media manager / hockey operations (Luke Fisher), head of commercial operations (Mark Brooks), and a board of directors. Disciplinary matters are handled by EIHL Hockey Operation's Department of Player Safety (DOPS).\nHistory.\nEarly years (2003–2010).\nBritish ice hockey's structure underwent a major reorganisation in 1996. The British Hockey League (the highest senior competition since 1982, featuring the top two divisions of the sport) was disbanded and replaced by the Ice Hockey Superleague (top tier) and British National League (second tier).\nThe loss of the Cardiff Devils and the Newcastle Jesters in 2001 reduced the membership of the Superleague to seven; and when the Manchester Storm and the Scottish Eagles folded within a week of one another at the beginning of the 2002–03 season, there were just five remaining teams. In December 2002, the Bracknell Bees announced their intention to resign from the league to join the BNL at the end of the season; and uncertainty surrounded the future of the London Knights and their London Arena home; which ultimately led to the Knights folding in 2003. Owing a large debt to Ice Hockey UK and facing the prospect of having only three members, the league placed itself into liquidation on 30 April 2003.\nThe three remaining clubs (Belfast Giants, Nottingham Panthers, and Sheffield Steelers) began considering the formation of a new league with a lower wage cap and larger commitment to British players to attract other clubs into joining them. In the weeks that followed they were joined by the Basingstoke Bison, Cardiff Devils, and Coventry Blaze of the British National League and two new organisations, from London and Manchester. A team based in Glasgow was also planned, but did not come to fruition. The new league met considerable opposition from the British National League and the governing body Ice Hockey UK. The IHUK wished for the remaining Superleague clubs to integrate themselves into the BNL and initially refused to grant the new league affiliation. The Superleague clubs were reluctant to join the predominantly British-trained league after several years of playing in an import-dominated league where British players were seldom able to step up to the standard of their North American and European counterparts. The Elite League instead preferred a twelve import limit with the rest of the team being British-trained players. \nThe refusal to grant affiliation caused a bitter row that showed little sign of being resolved. Despite not having the support of the governing body, the new league continued their plans. No affiliation would have meant that the clubs would have problems attaining work permits for their signings and finding officials to referee their matches. The row also threatened the future of the Nottingham Panthers, as the National Ice Centre were reluctant to allow a team from an unaffiliated league to hire their arena. The issue was resolved in August 2003 when the Panthers and the NIC announced an icetime agreement. The EIHL finally gained affiliation in August 2003, with only weeks to go before the beginning of the new season.\nThe new league began on 12 September 2003, when the Sheffield Steelers, who went on to become the inaugural league champions, defeated the newly formed London Racers 6–1 at Alexandra Palace. Charles, Prince of Wales dropped the first puck, after unveiling a plaque. The Racers endured a difficult first season, moving to a different rink only weeks into the season and having to wait 40 games to record a win, a 3–0 victory over the Cardiff Devils. The Racers finished the season with 10 points, 38 points behind second-to-last Basingstoke. The other new team, the Manchester Phoenix, fared slightly better, qualifying for the playoff finals after finishing sixth in the league, where they were defeated 6–1 by Nottingham in the semifinal. The club played at the 17,500 capacity MEN Arena which had been home to the Manchester Storm, but Phoenix crowds averaged 2,250, well below the break-even mark of 3,000. Late in the season, the Phoenix choose to play a game at IceSheffield rather than pay the considerable cost of hiring the arena for a mid-week game (which usually had lower attendances). In the close season they allowed fans to vote on the option of either suspending playing operations while a new rink was constructed or playing in exile away from Manchester while a new rink was built. Supporters opted to suspend playing operations pending the construction of a new facility.\nThe second season of the EIHL saw a series of games between the EIHL clubs and the members of the BNL. In addition to three home games and three away games against their Elite opponents, each club also played one home game and one away game against the BNL clubs in crossover match-ups. Results in these crossover games counted towards a team's points tally. The NHL lock-out also saw a number of NHL players join British clubs. Coventry won the League Title, The Challenge Cup and the Playoffs, winning the championship with an overtime victory over the Nottingham Panthers, whilst Belfast won the EIHL-BNL Crossover League.\nThe crossover games with the BNL clubs were seen by many to be the first stage towards an amalgamation of the two organizations into one league; essentially reforming the original BHL. However, early in the season it was revealed that two teams from the BNL, the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers, were seeking to resign from the BNL and join the EIHL; preferring the standard of hockey that the EIHL had to offer. A withdrawal of these clubs would leave the BNL with only five remaining participating teams. This situation led to the resigning teams temporarily withdrawing their Elite League applications and entering into collective discussions on the entire BNL joining the EIHL instead. The Elite League offered the BNL clubs invitations to join the EIHL structure, which were declined by the remaining teams due to unfavourable terms. Subsequently, the Capitals and Vipers both resubmitted individual applications to the Elite League; both of which were accepted. This ultimately led to the dissolution of the BNL, with the five remaining teams joining the next tier of British hockey (which consisted of the English Premier Ice Hockey League in England and the Scottish National League in Scotland). \nWith the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers becoming the ninth and tenth members of the league, the 2005–06 season began with nine clubs (Manchester had opted to take another season out with no rink yet constructed). However, in November 2005, the London Racers withdrew their team from competition and immediately ceased operations. From their formation the Racers had suffered problems finding a rink with comparable facilities to those of their rivals and they had maintained only a very small fan base. The club had made the Lee Valley Ice Centre their home after playing only a small number of games at the Alexandra Palace in their first season. The facilities were very basic, seating only 900 people with an overall capacity of barely 1,000. In November 2005, during a game against the Nottingham Panthers; Panthers player Blaž Emeršič suffered a serious facial injury after colliding with a protruding object in the boards. Further concerns were raised when a game against the Sheffield Steelers was abandoned after a piece of plexiglas shattered in an irregular manner, injuring a spectator. When a similar event took place during practice a few days later; the Racers management began to question seriously the safety of the rink. With the Ice Centre unable to ensure the safety of players and spectators at Elite League games, the Racers were forced to suspend team operations effective immediately.\nIn January 2006, the Manchester Phoenix were granted planning permission to construct a new rink in Altrincham. A few weeks later, the Cardiff Devils also received planning permission for the construction of a new rink. The Wales National Ice Rink was earmarked for demolition and a campaign for the council to provide a new facility proved successful. With both clubs confirming their intent to take part the following season, speculation began about the possible inclusion of a tenth team to replace the London Racers. After the season was over, rumours about the possible admission of either Hull or Dundee became more and more widespread. On 22 June 2006, the Hull Stingrays were formally elected into the Elite Ice Hockey League as the tenth active member.\nIn June 2006, the EIHL announced the adoption of the \"zero tolerance\" interpretation of the rules with regard to holding, hooking and interference implemented in the National Hockey League during the 2005–06 season. These rules had proved highly successful in the NHL, increasing the pace of the game and leading to a rise in spectator numbers.\nOn 25 August 2006, the Elite League announced a sponsorship deal with the low cost airline bmibaby. The agreement saw the company's name incorporated into the league's title and the airline's branding at each of the league's ten arenas. The deal was intended to last for seven seasons, but ended prematurely during the 2008–09 season.\nOn 30 April 2009, the Manchester Phoenix announced that they would withdraw from the league, and play instead in the English Premier Ice Hockey League, due to cost issues. This news followed the announcement that the Basingstoke Bison were also leaving to play in the EPL for the 2009–10 season.\nLeague expands and changes (2010–2020).\nAfter losing two teams at the end of the 2008–09 season the Elite League was boosted by a new franchise joining the league. The Braehead Clan were announced as the ninth team for the 2010–11 season. On 27 April 2010, the Dundee Stars were unanimously accepted into the League by the EIHL board as the tenth team.\nThe Hull Stingrays withdrew from the League on 11 August 2010, announced via the club's official website, and later confirmed on the BBC's site. However, after a takeover from the Coventry Blaze on 17 August 2010, the Hull Stingrays confirmed that they would indeed be participating in the league for the 2010–11 season. The Stingrays again withdrew, on 24 June 2015, as the club announced on its official website that it has been placed into liquidation.\nFrom the 2013–14 season onwards, the league has consisted of two conferences; each consisting of five teams. These are the Erhardt Conference and the Gardiner Conference. These can roughly be split into north and south, with the Erhardt featuring the teams from Belfast, Cardiff, Coventry, Nottingham, and Sheffield; and the Gardiner featuring the teams from Dundee, Edinburgh, Fife, and Glasgow along with Hull Stingrays until 2015, and their replacements Manchester Storm from 2015 onwards.\nOn 27 April 2017 it was announced that the Milton Keynes Lightning and Guildford Flames were joining for the start of the 2017–18 season and that the league schedule would be increased to 56 games in the regular season with three new conferences of four teams.\nConference 1 consisted of the Braehead Clan, Dundee Stars, Edinburgh Capitals and Fife Flyers known as the Scottish Conference.\nConference 2 consisted of the Coventry Blaze, Guildford Flames, Manchester Storm and Milton Keynes Lightning known as the Southern Conference.\nConference 3 consisted of the Belfast Giants, Cardiff Devils, Nottingham Panthers and Sheffield Steelers known as the Arena Teams. This meant that teams would play teams in their own conference eight times (four home and four away) totaling 24 games and play the other conference's teams four times (two home and two away) totaling 32 games, giving the league a total of 56 games.\nIn April 2018, when the Murrayfield Ice Rink asked for bidders for the ice time at the arena, the Edinburgh Capitals and Murrayfield Racers (a newly formed team) bid for the rights with the Racers winning the opportunity. The Racers asked for permission to join the EIHL, but on 30 April the league refused their application and they subsequently joined the Scottish National League (SNL).\nOn 4 May, the EIHL released a statement explaining that they would have to move forward without the Edinburgh Capitals with a board meeting on 22 May to discuss the league future format and decide on any clubs wishing to participate in place of Edinburgh.\nAfter the conclusion of the 2018–19 season, the Milton Keynes Lightning officially left the EIHL after just two seasons in the league and moved to the newly created National Ice Hockey League (NIHL), returning the number of teams to 10. The three conference format was also scrapped.\nRecent years (2020–present).\nThe 2019–20 EIHL season was cancelled in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Only the Challenge Cup (won by Sheffield Steelers) was awarded with both the league and play-offs cancelled.\nThe 2020–21 EIHL season, originally scheduled for a September start, was suspended indefinitely on September 15, 2020, due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions and continuing social distancing which made the league season a non-starter.\nWhile there were tentative plans for a shortened league season, featuring a handful of sides to potentially begin play in January 2021, this idea - and the prospect of a 2020–21 season - were shelved by the league in February 2021 due to concerns around funding.\nThen, in March 2021, the Elite League announced that four of the English teams (Coventry, Manchester, Nottingham and Sheffield) would take part in the 'Elite Series' between April–May 2021, a total of 24 games to be played at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, culminating in a best-of-three play-off final series. Nottingham claimed the trophy by virtue of a 2–0 series win over the Sheffield Steelers in the final, winning game one 5-3 and game two 5-2.\nIn the 2021–22 EIHL season, the first full season to be completed since 2018–19 due to the impacts of the Covid pandemic, the Belfast Giants won both the Elite League title and the Challenge Cup, while the Cardiff Devils won the play-offs.\nIn May 2022, all ten Elite League clubs agreed to increase the gameday roster size from 19 to 20 - to take effect from the 2022–23 season. Import numbers in a gameday squad were once again capped at 14.\nIn April 2023, the league announced that the end of season play-off final weekend would continue to be played at Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena until at least 2029.\nIn the 2022–23 EIHL season, the Belfast Giants became the first team since Nottingham in 2013 to complete the Elite League grand slam, after winning the league title, Challenge Cup and play-offs. The Giants finished ahead of second placed Guildford in the league, and defeated the Fife Flyers and Cardiff Devils in the Challenge Cup and play-off finals respectively.\nThe following season, 2023–24, the Sheffield Steelers won their first league title since 2016, the Challenge Cup and the play-offs to complete a grand slam of their own. It was Sheffield's first grand slam in the Elite League era and first since 2001.\nStructure.\nSeveral competitions fall under the jurisdiction of the Elite League.\nUp until the end of the 2018–19 season, the league consisted of three conferences, the results of which were compiled in one league table:\nTeams played each other six times (three home, three away), making for a 60-game regular season, but after the departure of Milton Keynes Lightning in 2019, the conference system was scrapped for the first time since 2011–12. Each team now plays 54 games.\nTwo points are awarded for a win and one for an overtime or penalty shootout defeat. Overtime consists of five minutes of three-on-three hockey and ends immediately if a goal is scored. The team that has most points at the end of the regular season is declared champion. Each team receives a regular season participation trophy.\nThe playoffs are contested by the teams with the best regular season records. The winner is crowned the champion of the British Championship. The number of teams competing in the playoffs has varied. However, since the 2006–07 season, the top eight teams of the regular season have qualified for the quarter-finals, with their league position determining their seeding. All quarter-finals are two-legged ties. Both the semi-finals and the final take place over a single weekend in April at the National Ice Centre in Nottingham.\nThe Challenge Cup has taken a number of different formats, ranging from a table formed from the results of designated league fixtures to groups of four teams playing on a round-robin basis at the beginning of the season. During some seasons, Elite League games have also been classed as Challenge Cup games and points counted for both. The semi-finals and final are two-legged games, the winner being the team with the highest aggregate score at the end of the second game. All quarter- and semi-finalists receive a playoff participation trophy.\nClubs.\nPotential future clubs.\nThe Aberdeen Lynx (currently competing in the Scottish National League) have stated that their ambition is to establish an Elite League team in the city in the future.\nThe Nottingham Panthers and Glasgow Clan owner Neil Black is rumoured to be setting up a new EIHL franchise in London, playing at Wembley Arena. Black has also stated in the past that he would like to see franchises in Manchester (which has now been achieved) and Dublin.\nWayne Scholes, owner of the Telford Tigers (currently in the English Premier League), has stated that his organisation does not have any immediate plans to make the step up, but has not ruled out the possibility of joining the EIHL in the future, saying that \"We have had conversations with the Elite League before but they have to invite you. You can't approach them. It is one of those things where they want to see that you have got two or three years of really good solid success. They want to see that it is sustainable and that you are up to a certain standard, and then they will reach out. At that point, it's a discussion that we will have but right now we are pretty happy where we are.\"\nEIHL Champions by season.\nThe following table sets out the League champions, National champions and Challenge Cup winners of the EIHL era only. Several previous top-tier leagues, such as the Sekonda Super League have also existed, in which some EIHL clubs competed successfully, and the end-of-season play-offs and Challenge Cup both have a long history prior to the founding of the EIHL, again feature many of the teams currently in EIHL.\nOnly four teams have won a domestic treble in the EIHL era; Coventry Blaze in 2004–05, Nottingham Panthers in 2012–13, Belfast Giants in 2022–23 and Sheffield Steelers in 2023-24. By contrast, teams have come within one match of a treble on no less than 13 occasions, beginning with the very first season when Panthers denied Sheffield Steelers by the odd goal in seven in the Challenge Cup final, and including the four completed seasons before last where Belfast Giants twice and Cardiff Devils twice, have been denied a 'Grand Slam' by losing in either the Challenge Cup or play-off final. Although dominated as might be expected by the English teams that represent the majority of the clubs in the league (winning 34 of 55 available trophies up to 2023), the sole entrants from Northern Ireland and Wales, Belfast (13 trophies) and Cardiff (eight trophies), have both enjoyed significant success across all competitions in the EIHL era. In 2023 Fife Flyers became the first Scottish team in the EIHL era to reach a major final, losing 9-3 to Belfast Giants in the Challenge Cup final.\nPlayers.\nElite League teams rely heavily on players from outside the United Kingdom (termed \"imports\"). The majority of these players are from North America, and typically played in the minor North American leagues such as the ECHL and American Hockey League (AHL) before coming to Britain. For example, of the 21 players to play for champions Belfast Giants in the 2005–06 season, 10 were Canadian, 8 were British and 3 were American. The league restricts the number of import players which can be dressed for a game, with a current limit of 14 imports. Player turnover is high, with a large proportion of players spending a single season at a team before moving on, and multi-year contracts are uncommon.\nAs would be expected in a league dominated by North American players, the style of ice hockey in Britain is similar to that played in North America, and has a more physical style than that played in other, technically natured European countries. This was demonstrated during the 2004–05 NHL lock-out. Of the NHL players to join Elite League teams, the majority were players noted for physical play rather than puck-handling skills; such as Wade Belak and Eric Cairns.\nWhile British players account for a minority of Elite League players, the league supplies the majority of players for the British national ice hockey team. All 22 players in the Great Britain squad for the 2018 World Championships played for Elite League teams in the preceding season.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision broadcast deals.\nIn the 1980s and 1990s, Sky Sports and \"BBC's Grandstand\" programme covered the British Hockey League and Superleague and their important games and competitions regularly.\nHowever, in 2001 the Superleague sold its broadcasting rights to Premium TV Ltd who planned to set up a new sports channel, which never materialised. British ice hockey was left without coverage from any television network. This situation continued through the final seasons of the Superleague and into the first seasons of the Elite League.\nIn 2005, Elite League officials concluded an agreement with the North American Sports Network to provide a weekly highlights and news programme. These usually provide highlights from a game recorded the previous weekend and are an hour in length.\nIn September 2007, the Elite League announced a deal with Sky Sports for a weekly show of Elite League highlights.\nIn 2010, Sky Sports showed the playoff final between the Belfast Giants and Cardiff Devils live, the first time Sky had shown a live game for several years. Sky Sports have recently announced plans to show live games along with a weekly highlight show during the 2010–11 season.\nIn the 2013–14 season, Premier Sports acquired the rights to film and broadcast 23 games from the Elite League with a live game shown every Saturday night from 23 November onwards.\nOn 6 December 2016, it was announced that a new TV show called \"Facing Off\" would be broadcast on a UK free-to-air channel called \"Front Runner TV\" every Thursday, Friday and Saturday to show the highlights of the week's EIHL games. The deal ran to the end of 2016–17 EIHL season.\nThen, on 20 July 2018, the EIHL agreed a two-year deal with FreeSports to broadcast one live EIHL game every two weeks, alongside a pre-season preview show, highlights package, and live coverage of the end of season play-off final. The coverage, which was available via Freeview, Sky, Virgin, FreeSat, TalkTalk, BT Vision and online via the TVPlayer, was fronted by Aaron Murphy who previously commentated on the league for Premier Sports.\nIn January 2020, the league announced that Premier Sports would show live coverage of the 2020 Challenge Cup final and 2020 Elite League play-off final.\nIn September 2021, the league confirmed that Premier Sports had become headline sponsors and the EIHL's exclusive television partners for three seasons, beginning from the 2021–22 season. Coverage would again be fronted by Aaron Murphy, with analysis from Paul Adey, and consist of 27 live matches - including 23 league games, the Challenge Cup final and the end of season play-off final weekend. During this time, the league was known as the Premier Sports Elite League. In November 2022, following news Viaplay had acquired Premier Sports, the Elite League's title sponsors changed to the Viaplay Elite League to reflect the rebrand.\nThe EIHL were without a major television rights holder during the 2023/24 season after ending their relationship with Viaplay. However, after Premier Sports re-acquired the contract from Viaplay in April 2024, they broadcast the end of season play-off final weekend from Nottingham. Aaron Murphy, Paul Adey and Chris Ellis were again the broadcast crew.\nOther coverage.\nIce hockey receives little national media coverage in the United Kingdom. Some national newspapers list results and provide short summaries of the league's news but more extensive coverage remains minimal. There was a small surge in interest during the 2004–05 season when newspapers such as \"The Times\" reported on the NHL players playing the Elite League as a result of the lock-out but since the lock-out ended, coverage has returned to its previous levels.\nOf the national newspapers only the \"Daily Star\" has a regular ice hockey column, which appears on Tuesday and Sunday.\nCoverage in the towns and cities where Elite League clubs are based is more extensive, and local newspapers have dedicated ice hockey reporters who cover the local team. Local radio stations such as BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, BBC Radio Nottingham, and BBC Radio Sheffield all provide programming on the sport. Radio Sheffield also provides a weekly ice hockey programme \"Iceline\" while Radio Nottingham has broadcast a similar programme, \"Powerplay\", since the later stages of the 2005–06 season, and has a 15-minute weekly preview of games on Saturday evenings during the ice hockey season after the station's coverage of the local football teams is completed. BBC Coventry &amp; Warwickshire have also followed suit with \"Faceoff\", a programme broadcast on the first Thursday of the month during the season.\nThe Cardiff Devils are given weekly highlights coverage on local TV station, \"Made in Cardiff\", which is available on Freeview Ch23, Sky Guide Ch134 and Virgin Ch159.\nMost of the teams also provide webcasts on match nights.\nComparison to other leagues.\nIn attendance, the EIHL ranks seventh among the European top leagues with a 2,842 average. Three teams are among the top 100 of the continent: 2016 Challenge Cup champions Nottingham Panthers at 38th (5,720 average), the 2016 league champions Sheffield Steelers at 64th (4,830), and the 2012 league champions Belfast Giants at 70th (4,603)\nPreviously, the EIHL champions were invited to play in the IIHF Continental Cup, Europe's second-level club competition. For the 2009–10 tournament, the EIHL's entrants began the tournament in the penultimate (third) group stage. However, with the introduction of the Champions Hockey League, this has changed. From the 2015–16 season, the top two teams in the EIHL participate in the CHL, with either the team that wins the post-season playoffs, or the team finishing third if the playoffs winner is one of the top two, entering the Continental Cup.\nDuring the 2012–13 NHL Lockout, several NHL players plied their trade in the Elite League, including; Matt Beleskey, Paul Bissonnette, Drew Miller, Tom Sestito and Anthony Stewart.\nThe league has had a reputation for attracting ex-NHL players, including Dustin Kohn who played for the Sheffield Steelers, Kevin Westgarth who played for the Belfast Giants, Cam Janssen, formerly of the Nottingham Panthers, ex-Braehead Clan captain Matt Keith and Stefan Della Rovere, Ryan O'Marra of the Coventry Blaze, and Brian McGrattan who played for the Nottingham Panthers.\nElsewhere Jared Staal – brother of NHLers Eric, Marc and Jordan – played a season for the Edinburgh Capitals while Patrick Bordeleau played a season with the Cardiff Devils.\nOther recent ex-NHL players in the league include Jason Williams, Ric Jackman, Jay Rosehill, Jim Vandermeer, Pavel Vorobyev, Michael Garnett, Tyson Strachan, Tim Wallace, Aaron Johnson, Dylan Olsen, Patrick Dwyer, Griffin Reinhart, and Chris Stewart.\nMeanwhile, in being drafted by the Arizona Coyotes in 2018, Sheffield Steelers forward Liam Kirk became the first English born and trained player to be drafted by an NHL side. Kirk signed a three-year, entry-level contract with Arizona in June 2021.\nCriticism of the EIHL.\nThe main criticism levelled at the EIHL is that the league is too expensive, an accusation given credence by the collapse of the London Racers mid-season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced by a number of other member clubs (most notably the Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09).\nBoth the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.\nThis perceived problem with expenditure was given further credence when the Hull Stingrays announced, on 11 August 2010, that they were ceasing operations immediately, due to insufficient funds from sponsorships to guarantee completing the season. They were, however, taken over on 17 August 2010 by the Coventry Blaze and therefore the Hull Stingrays continued to operate. However, Hull did fold in 2015.\nIn 2011, the Newcastle Vipers announced that they would not be able to compete in the 2011–12 season due to financial difficulties and lack of a permanent home stadium. Newcastle had, up to this point, been playing their home games at Whitley Bay ice rink. A proposed new stadium in the Newcastle area did not materialise.\nExpansion.\nDespite there being a limited number of suitable venues for league expansion, there have been various attempts during the EIHL's lifespan to expand the league. After the successful addition of the Braehead Clan and the Dundee Stars for the 2010–11 season, the EIHL reported that it had entered discussions with the Fife Flyers formerly of the defunct BNL, and then resident in the SNL.\nOn 24 June 2011, it was confirmed that the Fife Flyers had been admitted to the EIHL in time for the commencement of the 2011–12 season.\nFurther to this, Neil Black, owner of the Nottingham Panthers and Glasgow Clan has expressed the desire to see a Manchester team back in the EIHL by 2015, along with teams in Dublin and London, subject to there being suitable venues available.\nIn mid-2013, stories began to circulate that the EIHL had approached AEG with the intention of placing a London-based franchise into Wembley Arena. League chairman Tony Smith confirmed that a franchise had been awarded to a London-based group for a franchise located within the capital.\nOn 29 March 2016, it was announced that the Milton Keynes Lightning (playing in the second-tier English Premier League) would be joining the Elite League for the 2017–18 season. They remained in the league for two seasons.\nOn 24 February 2017, it was announced that the Guildford Flames would make the step-up to the Elite League for the following season, thus expanding the league to twelve teams."

        "title": "Umpire (field hockey)",
        "text": "An umpire in field hockey is a person with the authority to make decisions on a hockey pitch in accordance with the rules of the game. Each match is controlled by two such umpires. In theory they are responsible for decisions taken on their respective half of the field, but practically they 'control' on either diagonal half of the field. In many higher-level events, a \"reserve umpire\" is appointed in addition to the two \"field umpires\" to act as a back-up in the event of injury or other issue preventing a field umpire from commencing or continuing a match. In World-Level competitions, a \"video umpire\" is also appointed in addition to the field and reserve umpires.\nRole and positioning.\nThe role of the umpires is to control the match, apply the rules of hockey, uphold a duty of care to the players (keeping the game safe), be the judges of fair play and keep the flow. Each umpire has the primary responsibility for decisions in one half of the field, and is the only one allowed to award a penalty corner, penalty stroke or goal in their half of the field or a free hit in their circle (see diagram). However, they may consult with their colleague before making these decisions. They must also ensure that the correct amount of time is allowed for the match and record the scoring of goals and issuing of penalty cards to players. Similarly to football referees, most decisions are signalled using a whistle (and the use of the whistle is specifically instructed in the Rules), and the use of various hand signals.\nOriginally their half of the field was taken to coincide with the two halves of the pitch as divided by the halfway line. Now the division is generally taken to run down the diagonal of the pitch, from top left to bottom right in the accompanying pitch diagram. For breaches of the rules bordering the umpires' 'area of control', jurisdiction is generally given to whichever umpire the play is coming towards. When play is in and around their shooting circle, the umpire will generally take up a position in the shooting circle, particularly if play has come from the further side of the pitch, and when play is more in the middle of the pitch will be closer to the right-hand sideline (facing the goal for which they are responsible). Positioning in the shooting circle is critical as correct decisions are necessary here to maintain the control of the match as well as the outcome. Exact positioning will be determined by the need to keep the ball in view, the desire to be reasonably close to the ball and the relative pace of the game. The preferred position of most umpires is behind and to the right of the play as the lead umpire, whilst the other umpire (the trailing umpire) is around 15m behind at a 45 degree angle with the engaged umpire.\nHistory.\nThe early history of hockey officiating is quite similar to that of football refereeing: decisions could only be made on appeal by the players (compare with cricket where this is still the case for some decisions); and if no dedicated official was available the team captain could act as an umpire in addition to playing. Over time it has come to be desirable that the umpires should be neutral, although many matches are still played with one umpire from each club involved in the game.\nUniform.\nUmpires are required by the Rules to wear clothing of \"similar colours to one another, but different from those of both teams\". \nIn practice, umpires appointed by their Association, National body or the FIH wear black slacks (male) or a black skirt with knee-high black socks (female). In club competitions, particularly in colder climates, females often adopt the black pants instead of a skirt. Each competition has its own approved umpiring shirt, sometimes with various colour options and sometimes with different shirts for different competition divisions (for example, the premier league may have a different shirt to the remainder of the competition).\nIn February 2012, Grays International became the new supplier of official's uniforms (including umpiring shirts) for FIH competitions, replacing TK. Grays manufacture three colours of umpire shirts for international matches - red, yellow and blue. Previous colours used by the FIH include cerise, turquoise and yellow (circa 2005) and fuchsia, turquoise and purple (circa 2000).\nVideo Umpires.\nIn FIH World-Level competitions, where facilities are available, a video umpire is appointed in addition to the field and reserve umpires. The scope of the video umpire's role is restricted to making decisions as to whether or not a goal has been legally scored. To this end, the video umpire may assist in decisions to determine:\nDecisions may be referred to the video umpire upon the request of a player of either team, or directly by a field umpire. Each team is permitted one video umpire referral per match, which is retained if the referral is successful and forfeited if the referral is unsuccessful. There is no limit to the number of field umpire referrals in a match."

        "title": "Bob Stanley (baseball)",
        "text": "Robert William Stanley (born November 10, 1954) is an American former professional baseball relief pitcher who spent his entire Major League Baseball (MLB) career with the Boston Red Sox. He was later the pitching coach for the Buffalo Bisons, Triple-A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, through the 2018 season.\nEarly life.\nStanley attended Kearny High School in Kearny, New Jersey, where he earned all-state honors as a pitcher-shortstop; he came within three outs of pitching a perfect game in May 1973 against Bloomfield High School.\nPlaying career.\nStanley was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the ninth round of the June 1973 MLB draft, but did not sign with the team, choosing instead to attend college. During this era, another draft was held in the winter; Stanley was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the first round of the January 1974 secondary draft, and this time elected to sign. He began his professional career with the Elmira Pioneers in , spent with the Winter Haven Red Sox, and advanced to the Bristol Red Sox at the Double-A level in . Stanley made his major league debut with the Red Sox on April 16, .\nStanley was named an All-Star in , a year in which he pitched in 40 games (30 starts). He won 16 games and lost 12, with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.99. Following two more seasons of mixed usage, Stanley was deployed as a full-time relief pitcher in 1982, maintaining a 3.10 ERA over innings pitched. As of the beginning of the 2022 season, this remains the American League record for innings pitched by a relief pitcher. While he was not named to the All-Star team, Stanley was recognized with down-ballot votes for the Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards. He was named to his second All-Star team the following season, , appearing in 64 games and pitching innings, while recording 33 saves and a 2.85 ERA, and he remained a fixture of the Red Sox bullpen in the years which followed.\nStanley was a key member of the 1986 Red Sox team that came within one strike of winning the World Series but ultimately fell to the New York Mets in seven games. Stanley entered Game 6 with the Red Sox one out away from clinching their first World Series since 1918, holding a one-run lead with runners on first and third. Stanley threw a wild pitch to Mookie Wilson which allowed Kevin Mitchell to score the tying run and Ray Knight to move to second base, putting him in position to score the winning run on Bill Buckner's fielding error. Stanley and the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium for Game 7, which the New York Mets won by a score of 8–5.\nIn , Stanley was converted to a regular starting pitcher for the first time since 1979, compiling a 4–15 record with 67 strikeouts and a 5.01 ERA. After returning to the bullpen to pitch two more seasons as a reliever, Stanley announced his retirement on September 25, . In a 13-year career spent entirely with the Red Sox, he compiled a 115–97 win–loss record with 693 strikeouts, a 3.64 ERA, 21 complete games, seven shutouts, 132 saves, and 1707 innings pitched in 637 games (85 as a starter).\nA sinker ball specialist, Stanley is the Red Sox all-time leader in appearances and relief wins, and was inducted to the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2000. Stanley was also the team's all-time saves leader, a record he held for 20 years, until Jonathan Papelbon tied him on June 29, 2009, and then passed him on July 1, 2009. Stanley is the first, and to date only, player born in Maine to be named to an MLB All-Star Game.\nCoaching career.\nPrior to joining the Blue Jays, Stanley served as a minor league pitching coach in the New York Mets' and San Francisco Giants' organizations, including service with the Connecticut Defenders, the Giants' Double-A Eastern League affiliate.\nOn December 23, 2011, Stanley was announced as the pitching coach for the Blue Jays' Triple-A affiliate, the Las Vegas 51s. \nOn January 7, 2013, Toronto announced that Stanley would be the pitching coach for their new Triple-A farm club, the Buffalo Bisons.\nAlmost a year later, on January 4, 2014, the Blue Jays announced that Stanley would be replacing Pat Hentgen as their bullpen coach. On December 19, Stanley was named the pitching coach for the Double-A New Hampshire Fisher Cats. On January 19, 2016, Stanley was announced as returning to the Buffalo Bisons. Stanley was confirmed to return for a third season as the Bisons' pitching coach on January 19, 2017.\nPersonal.\nDuring his career, Stanley earned the nicknames \"the Steamer\" and \"Bigfoot.\" He lives in the Seacoast region of southern New Hampshire. On April 4, 2011, he was named President of the Seacoast Mavericks of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL). On June 10, 2011, Stanley threw out the first pitch to inaugurate the Martha's Vineyard Sharks of the FCBL."

        "text": "Steven Michael Stone (born July 14, 1947) is an American former Major League Baseball (MLB) player and current sportscaster and author.\nStone pitched for four MLB teams between 1971 and 1981. In 1980, he was the AL Cy Young Award winner and an American League All Star, finishing the season with a record of 25–7 for the Baltimore Orioles. He was WGN-TV's color commentator for Chicago Cubs broadcasts between 1983 and 2004, missing a couple of seasons late in his tenure due to health problems. He worked in radio until 2009, when he became the color commentator for Chicago White Sox television broadcasts.\nEarly life.\nStone is Jewish, and was born in South Euclid, Ohio, a Cleveland suburb, to Dorothy (a waitress) and Paul Stone (who changed records in juke boxes, and later became an insurance salesman), who were Orthodox Jews. His maternal grandfather, Edward Manheim, lived to see Stone celebrate his bar mitzvah in September 1960. Stone played high school ball at Charles F. Brush High School for baseball Coach Jim Humpall. Growing up he also won several tennis championships, was a ping pong champion, and was a proficient golfer.\nAt Kent State University, Stone was an outstanding pitcher and his catcher was Thurman Munson. He was selected to the All Mid-American Conference team, and was named team captain as a junior. He had a 2.00 ERA for the Chatham Anglers in the Cape Cod League in 1968. He also starred on the bowling, volleyball, and tennis teams. He joined Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity. He graduated in 1970 with a teaching degree in history and government.\nDraft and minor leagues.\nIn 1968, he was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the 16th round of the draft, but did not sign. In February 1969, he was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the fourth round of the draft (secondary phase).\nFrom 1969–1971, Stone pitched in the minor leagues. In 1969, he pitched for the Fresno Giants, in 1970 for the Phoenix Giants and Amarillo Giants, and in 1971 again for Phoenix. He compiled a 32–24 record, and struck out nearly a batter per inning.\nMajor league career.\nSan Francisco Giants (1971–72).\nBreaking the stereotype of ballplayers in his era, Stone said: Charlie Fox (manager of the Giants in 1971) felt the only way a ballplayer could perform was to chew tobacco, wear a sloppy uniform and, as he put it, not be afraid to get a bloody nose, and eat, drink and sleep baseball. I never thought a bloody nose was all that comfortable, and tobacco upsets my stomach. I like to eat – but not baseball – and I never thought sleeping with the game would be all that enjoyable. I think he thought reading hurt your eyes. Ron Fimrite mused in \"Sports Illustrated\" in May 1971 that Stone was \"a Jewish intellectual … who just might be a right-handed (Sandy) Koufax.\"\nIn 1972 he was 6–8 with a 2.98 ERA. After suffering a sore arm, Stone was traded by the Giants with Ken Henderson to the Chicago White Sox for Tom Bradley on November 29, 1972.\nChicago White Sox (1973).\nIn 1973, he was 6-11 with a 4.24 ERA, and was fourth in the AL in strikeouts per 9 innings pitched (7.04), and 8th in hit batsmen (7).\nChicago Cubs (1974–1976).\nStone was acquired along with Steve Swisher and Ken Frailing by the Chicago Cubs from the crosstown White Sox for Ron Santo on December 11, 1973. Jim Kremmel was also sent to the Cubs to complete the transaction one week later on December 18. In 1974 he was 8–5 with a 4.14 ERA. In 1975 he was 12–8 with a 3.95 ERA, and pitched 214.3 innings.\nChicago White Sox (1977–78).\nIn November 1976, after suffering a torn rotator cuff and undertaking cryotherapy after refusing surgery and cortisone injections, he signed as a free agent with the Chicago White Sox for $60,000 ($ today), turning down offers from four other teams.\nIn 1977, he was 15–12 with a 4.51 ERA in 207.1 innings. During that year on August 29, Stone gave up a home run to Cleveland Indians second baseman Duane Kuiper – Kuiper's only career home run in 3,379 at bats. In 1978, when he was paid $125,000 ($ today), he was 12–12 with a 4.37 ERA in 212 innings.\nBaltimore Orioles (1979–1981).\nIn November 1978, he signed a 4-year, $760,000 ($ today) deal as a free agent with the Baltimore Orioles, again turning down four other offers. In 1979 Stone was 11–7 with a 3.77 ERA in 186 innings, and was 7th in the league in fewest hits allowed per 9 innings pitched (8.37).\nHis best year was 1980, when he went 25–7 (.781) for the Orioles, won the Cy Young Award and \"The Sporting News\" Pitcher of the Year Award, and came in 9th in the AL MVP voting. Stone's relief pitchers did not blow a save for him all season until his last start of the year. He led the league in wins (his 25 wins set a team record) and won-lost percentage, and was second in games started (37), seventh in ERA (3.23), strikeouts (149), hits allowed/9 IP (8.04), and hit batsmen (6), and ninth in innings pitched (250.7). He also won the American League June 1980 Pitcher of the Month Award. He also started and pitched three perfect innings in the All-Star Game that year.\nStone threw as many as 73 curveballs in a game at least twice that season, even though he knew he might damage his pitching arm.\n\"I used to try not to lose before\", Stone said in 1980. \"Now, when I go out, I go out to win every time, and I'm certain I am. I try to envision myself literally walking off the mound a winner. I allow no negatives in my thinking. When certain ones start creeping in, I erase them and make it like a blank blackboard waiting to be filled in with things like, 'The team is going to play well, is going to score some runs, I'm going to throw strikes, I'm going to win.' \"\nAfter his Cy Young season, the pitcher who was listed as 5' 10\" commented: All my life, because of my size, people have been telling me what I couldn't do. They said I was too small and not durable enough. First they said I'd never pitch in high school. Then they said I'd never pitch in college. Then they said okay, but you'll never pitch professionally. Then they said well, maybe you're pitching professionally but you'll never make it out of the minors. When I got to the majors, they said well, you may be in the majors but you'll never be good. Now those same people are saying I won't have a good year this year. That kind of thing is reiterated by people who've never achieved a great deal themselves.\nStone suffered from shoulder tendinitis in 1981, going 4–7 with a 4.60 ERA. He appeared in a pair of spring training contests before going on the disabled list on March 21, 1982. He announced his retirement as an active player months later on June 2 due to recurring arm problems. His MLB career record was 107–93, 40–21 with the Orioles for a .656 winning percentage which was the best ever by a Baltimore pitcher over a three-year span. \nHe is considered one of the best Jewish pitchers in major league history. Through July 2011, Stone was third among Jewish pitchers in career wins (107) and strikeouts (1,065), behind Ken Holtzman and Sandy Koufax and directly ahead of Jason Marquis, and ninth in games pitched (320), behind Barry Latman. Reminiscing about Sandy Koufax's influence on him and others when he was a child, he said, \"He gave little Jewish boys some hope.\"\nSportscasting career (1982–present).\nMonday Night Baseball / ABC Sports (1982).\nFollowing his retirement, Stone was hired by ABC to serve as a color commentator for their \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts. Stone was normally paired with Al Michaels and Bob Uecker in the booth.\nChicago Cubs / WGN (1983–2004).\nIn 1983, Stone became a color commentator for the WGN television broadcasts of the Chicago Cubs, teaming for 14 years with Hall of Fame announcer Harry Caray. In 1985, he posed for \"Playgirl\". After Harry Caray's death in February 1998, Stone was paired with Caray's grandson Chip Caray. Stone left the booth due to health reasons in 2000, including a case of coccidioidomycosis (Valley fever) and kidney stones, and returned to the Cubs booth in 2003 and 2004.\nStone temporally took over play-by-play duties from Caray while the latter was recovering from a stroke at the start of the 1987 season. WGN announced that until Caray was well enough to return, guest announcers would fill in and sit alongside Stone.\nOn August 7, 1993, Stone provided commentary alongside Jim Kaat for a Cubs game against the St. Louis Cardinals for CBS.\nLeaving the Cubs booth.\nStone refused a contract extension as the Cubs color-man after the 2004 season amid a controversy involving Cubs players who felt he was being overly critical of their performance. Even so, he was a fan favorite. One reason he was so well-liked was his ability to accurately predict what might happen in various game situations, explaining to the audience why the strategy or pitch would be successful prior to the play. A famous example of this was him expressing \"I wouldn't pitch to this guy\" in a 2004 game, seconds before the batter (Adam Dunn) hit a home run off Cubs pitcher Mike Remlinger to give the Cincinnati Reds the lead.\nStone expressed frustration with Cubs manager Dusty Baker for not controlling his players. At one point during the 2004 season, Kent Mercker called the broadcast booth from the bullpen during a game to complain about comments made, also confronting Stone in a hotel lobby. Among the comments that reportedly irked Mercker were Chip Caray's praise of Houston Astros pitcher Roy Oswalt. It was also reported that Mercker and left fielder Moisés Alou shouted at Stone on a team charter plane to a road game in 2004, and that Alou tried to have Stone and Caray banned from the team charter flights.\nOn September 30, 2004, in the wake of a 12-inning loss to the Cincinnati Reds that all but eliminated the Cubs, Stone strongly criticized the team. \"The truth of this situation is [this is] an extremely talented bunch of guys who want to look at all directions except where they should really look, and kind of make excuses for what happened. ... This team should have won the wild-card [playoff berth] by six, seven games. No doubt about it.\" The comments stunned manager Baker and were a factor in Stone's resignation as a Cub broadcaster the following month.\nChicago White Sox (2005–present).\nIn early 2005 Stone was hired by Chicago radio station WSCR to provide commentary and host a weekly talk show, hosted on Mondays by Terry Boers and Dan Bernstein, on Tuesdays by Mike North, and on Thursdays by Brian Hanley and Mike Mulligan. He was also hired by ESPN to work some of that network's baseball telecasts.\nIn early August 2007, Stone filled in for Chicago White Sox color commentator Darrin Jackson, while Jackson took leave for the birth of his child, during which he successfully predicted a walk-off home run by Juan Uribe in extra innings. In October 2007, Stone called postseason games between the Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim for TBS, partnered with play-by-play announcer Ted Robinson. On March 4, 2008, Stone was named the color commentator for White Sox radio broadcasts for the 2008 season on WSCR AM670 The Score, replacing Chris Singleton, who moved to ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\".\nOn September 13, 2008, Stone accepted the job as the color commentator for White Sox television broadcasts for six years beginning with the 2009 season. He said he enjoyed being in the booth with Hawk Harrelson, stating that he liked his nickname \"Stone Pony.\" Stone also acted as a fill-in play-by-play announcer when Harrelson wasn't available. He worked with either analysts Tom Paciorek or Tony Graffanino.\nAfter Harrelson's retirement, Stone had been paired with Jason Benetti on White Sox telecasts. Benetti has since departed for division rival the Detroit Tigers, and John Schriffen will work with Stone beginning in 2024.\nWriting.\nIn 1999, Stone, along with Barry Rozner of the Chicago suburban area \"Daily Herald\", authored \"Where's Harry?\", a memoir of his experiences with Harry Caray in the WGN booth."

        "title": "Dickie Moore (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Richard Winston \"Dickie\" Moore (January 6, 1931 – December 19, 2015) was a Canadian professional hockey player, successful businessman and community philanthropist. He twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the National Hockey League's leading scorer and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Moore spent much of his career with the Montreal Canadiens, but also played briefly with the Toronto Maple Leafs and St. Louis Blues. In 2017 Moore was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history.\nCareer.\nMoore played left wing with the Montreal Canadiens from 1951 to 1963. He started playing with the Montreal Jr. Royals for three seasons from 1947 to 1950, and made his debut with the Montreal Canadiens in the middle of the 1951–52 season. Moore had played on two Memorial Cup winners, one with the Montreal Royals in 1949 and Montreal Junior Canadiens the following year. In the late 1940s Canadiens GM Frank Selke Sr. anointed him Canada's best junior.\nHe was known for his hard accurate shot and his ability to stickhandle the puck. He twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the league's leading scorer. Moore broke Gordie Howe's record of 95 total points in a regular season play with 41 goals and 55 assists. He often played on the same line as Henri Richard and Maurice Richard.\nMoore won the Stanley Cup for the first time in 1953 and was a member of the Montreal Canadiens team that won five consecutive cups from 1956 to 1960.\nDuring his 1957–58 season with the Canadiens, Moore suffered a broken wrist during a collision with Detroit defenceman Marcel Pronovost which threatened to cut short a scoring championship year. Journalist Red Fisher described what happened next: Moore, the competitor, wanted to win the Art Ross. He had his eye on the prize, but Moore, the team man, had other ideas. One night, when the Canadiens were travelling on the train, he asked for a meeting with coach Toe Blake and his linemates, Maurice and Henri Richard. At the time, Henri was Dickie's closest pursuer in the scoring race. Dickie told them he could still play with his wrist in a cast, but for how long? And as long as he played with an injury that would sideline most players, how much could he contribute to the line? \"It’s not fair to Henri,\" Moore told Blake. \"It’s not fair not to allow him to win the scoring title.\" The meeting lasted no more than a few minutes. It ended abruptly when Maurice and Henri told Blake: \"There’s no damned way he’s going off the line.\" Moore remained on the line. He played with his wrist imprisoned in a cast for the second half of the season. He won the Art Ross with an NHL-leading 36 goals and 48 assists in a 70-game season. Henri finished four points behind. Moore won it again in 1958–59 with 41 goals and 55 assists.\nHe retired following the 1962–63 season, but came back after a year's hiatus to play for the Toronto Maple Leafs. Another three-year break saw Moore return to play 45 games for the St. Louis Blues. The 37-year-old went out with a bang, picking up 14 postseason points as the Blues made it into the Finals in their inaugural campaign.\nIn 1974, Moore was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. In 1998, he was ranked number 31 on \"The Hockey News\"' list of the 100 Greatest Hockey Players.\nLater life.\nFollowing his retirement from hockey, Moore became a successful businessman, operating an equipment and tools rental business for construction in Montreal, Ottawa and Toronto.\nOn November 12, 2005, the Canadiens retired the uniform number 12 in honour of both Moore and Yvan Cournoyer.\nOn August 27, 2006, Moore suffered neck, spine, and rib injuries when his car was hit by a truck in Montreal. He was trapped in the car for 45 minutes before rescue. He died on December 19, 2015, in Montreal at the age of 84.\nPersonal.\nMoore had three children: Richard, Lianne and John. In 1973, Richard died at the age of 16 in a car accident. Richard had been attending Malcolm Campbell High School in Montreal. The Dickie Moore Memorial Awards are presented annually in memory of former Kentville Minor Hockey player Dickie Moore Jr."

        "title": "Lancashire League (cricket)",
        "text": "The Lancashire League is a competitive league of local cricket clubs drawn from the small to middle-sized mill towns, mainly but not exclusively, of East Lancashire. Its real importance is probably due to its history of employing professional players of international standing to play in the League. After declining earlier opportunities to have this status, the league became an ECB Premier League from the 2023 season.\nHistory.\nThe Lancashire Cricket League was formed on 16 March 1892, growing from the North East Cricket League that had been formed 17 months earlier. Currently in membership are Accrington CC, Bacup CC, Burnley CC, Church CC, Clitheroe CC, Colne CC, Crompton CC, Darwen Cricket Club, East Lancashire CC, Enfield CC, Great Harwood, Greenmount CC, Haslingden CC, Littleborough CC, Lowerhouse CC, Middleton CC, Nelson CC, Norden CC, Ramsbottom CC, Rawtenstall CC, Rishton CC, Rochdale CC, Todmorden CC (actually in Yorkshire) and Walsden CC (also in W Yorks). In the early years Bury CC were also members but they withdrew after participating for just two seasons.\nThe early 1890s saw the sudden emergence of cricket leagues all over Lancashire, with the first in 1888 - the Bolton Association. The North Lancashire League and the Central Lancashire League all started the same year as the Lancashire League in 1892. The Football League had set a trend in season 1888-89 and also had its heart in Lancashire, and with professionals and regular friendlies and local derbies, the leagues quickly became very popular institutions, with games played at weekends when working people had rare leisure time.\nIn the early years, until 1899, it was possible for each team to field two professionals, but this was restricted for the 1900 season to one professional. The League Centenary was celebrated in 1992, and in 1998 a major exhibition about the League was mounted by Horse and Bamboo Theatre at their Centre with the involvement of the author Ron Freethy.\nIn 1981 the name was amended to include the name of a sponsor, initially Blackburn brewer Matthew Brown, later E.W.Cartons and Sponsorbank, among others, and currently J.W.Lees.\nThe Lancashire League in its first season of 1892 consisted of only 13 clubs (the 14 current members minus Todmorden) before Bury played in 1893 and 1894 to give the league 14 clubs. Bury left for the 1895 season before Todmorden joined in 1897. The membership of the league did not then change for another 120 years, until three new clubs - Clitheroe, Darwen and Great Harwood - joined in 2017. In 2018 the number of member clubs was increased to 24 with the admission of Crompton, Norden, Littleborough, Middleton, Milnrow, Rochdale and Walsden.\nHowever, in 2019 Milnrow resigned from the league after only two seasons, to be replaced in 2020 by Bury's Greenmount CC.\nIn addition Edenfield entered the 20/20 Cup between 2007 and 2014 but did not enter any other Lancashire League competition.\nSenior competitions.\n1st XI League.\nThe league's 22 current member clubs are divided into two divisions. Games start out as 50 over matches but if rain affects play they can be reduced to a minimum of 20 overs. The method for working out reduced targets is to take 3/4 of the first innings run rate off the first innings score for every over that is lost in the second innings. One over is lost for every 7 minutes in the first innings and every 3½ minutes in the second innings. The second innings can be less than 20 overs as long as there were more than 20 overs bowled in the first innings and the team batting second believe they can chase the full total posted in the first innings or the team bowling second believe they can bowl their opponents out in the allocated overs. If the team batting second get the full total then they win. If the team bowling second bowl out the team batting second then they win. If neither team does this then it is a No Result. For example, Lowerhouse scored 124-7 off their allocated 31 overs. Nelson opted to chase 125 for victory off 12 overs. They ended up on 82-7 so neither team won and it was a no result. 10 points are awarded for a win, 7 points for a tie, 3 points for a no result and 2 points for bowling the opposition out. Up to 5 bonus points are then awarded to the team who lost. If the team that lost bowled second they get 1-point for 5 wickets, 2 for 6 wickets, 3 for 7 wickets, 4 for 8 wickets and 5 for 9 wickets. If they batted second they get 1-point for being within 50 runs, 2 points for being within 40 runs, 3 points for being within 30 runs, 4 points for being within 20 runs and 5 points for being within 10 runs. 1 point is deducted for slow over rate in an innings of more than 40 overs. One over is expected to be bowled in 3¾ minutes. One bowler may bowl up to 17 overs while no other bowlers may bowl more than 14 overs.\nWorsley Cup.\nEvery club in the league competes in this knockout tournament with two teams being given a random bye to the second round (there are four rounds in all). All games have to be 50 overs and if not completed on the given date have to be continued on weeknights or, if still in the first innings, the following Saturday. The first game is generally played on a Sunday and the reserve date is always a Saturday. Bowlers can bowl no more than 10 overs each.\nRon Singleton Colne Trophy.\nThe League winner plays the Worsley Cup winner in this competition. If a team wins both competitions then the Double winners play the team that finished second the previous year. It is played on the Saturday before the League starts. It is played to the same match rules as the Worsley Cup except that overs are deducted for bad weather. The Colne Trophy has to be a minimum of 20 overs. If the game cannot be completed then the trophy is shared.\n20/20 Cup.\nThere are 3 groups, 2 consisting of 6 and one group consisting of 5 and the top 3 clubs from each group (top 2 from the group of 5) go through to the quarter-final. In the group stage each team plays each other team once. 2 points are awarded for a win and 1 point for a tie. Each team must face a minimum of five overs for a game to be valid. The method for working out reduced targets is to subtract the full run rate for every over lost in the second innings. Games are played mainly on a Friday night but are occasionally played on a Thursday night. Teams can play in colours if they wish. Bowlers can bowl no more than 4 overs.\nThe professionals.\nThe existence of the Lancashire League is a testament to local cricketers and their supporters, but the sheer quantity and quality of the professional cricketers that have been drawn to the milltowns of East Lancashire and the surrounding area is astonishing. Players from all over the world have come to live and play in the League including: Dik Abed, Bill Alley, Nyron Asgarali, Nathan Astle, Sydney Barnes, Allan Border, Chris Cairns, Michael Clarke, Sir Learie Constantine, Kapil Dev, Allan Donald, Bruce Dooland, Roy Gilchrist, Dennis Lillee, Trevor Chappell, Jason Gillespie, Kerry O'Keeffe, Charlie Griffith, Andrew Hall, Wes Hall, Roger Harper, Chris Harris, George Headley, Michael Holding, Murali Kartik, Charlie Llewellyn, Clive Lloyd, Manny Martindale, Mark Orchard, Cec Pepper, Viv Richards, Andy Roberts, Fred Root, Jacques Rudolph, Peter Sleep, 'Big' Jim Smith, Hugh Tayfield, George Tribe, Lou Vincent, Shane Warne, Chester Watson, Steve Waugh, Bilawal Bhatti, Alviro Petersen, Robin Peterson and Everton Weekes. It is a rule of the competition that each team must have a professional player in their squad. Should the professional be unavailable then a substitute must be found. Teams not playing a pro can be fined.\nDocumentaries.\n\"Beyond a Boundary\".\nIn C.L.R. James' autobiographical \"Beyond a Boundary\", the Trinidadian writer writes about his visits as a young man to his friend Learie Constantine, at that time living in Nelson while playing as a professional for the town Lancashire League team. He gives a vivid sense of what it must have been like for a young West Indian to arrive in the wet and strange East Lancashire. He also describes how his subsequent education at university in Paris is helped by a local baker, and how his gradual politicisation is given a boost by meetings with local socialists, concerned with the harsh treatment and conditions suffered by the local working class millworkers. Although an extreme example, the meetings between other professional cricketers from the British Empire, and the mainly working-class amateurs of the Lancashire League, must have resulted in many other instances of mutual support and understanding.\n\"Race and Pace: West Indians in the East Lancashire League\".\nThe league and its relationship with West Indies professional cricketers is the subject of a 2017 BBC television documentary: \"Race and Pace: West Indians in the East Lancashire League\". The film features original footage of the players, shots of the ground and interviews with Wes Hall, Viv Richards, David Lloyd, and Learie Constantine's daughter."

Initially, the 22 clubs that broke away in 1895 played in one combined league; however, the following season saw the addition of many clubs, and the League was split into two separate county competitions.\nHistory.\nThis situation endured until 1901–02, when the top teams in each league resigned and formed a new combined first division. The following season, the remaining clubs formed a second division. From then until 1907, when there was another re-organisation, the county leagues were not played.\nThe new structure initiated for the 1907–08 season saw the clubs playing every other team in their own county home and away, and playing once each against the clubs from the other county. Results from all games counted towards the Rugby Football League Championship, whilst results within the county counted towards the respective county leagues.\nThe championship often included teams from outside the Yorkshire and Lancashire heartlands; these were allocated to a county league on a practical basis. Briefly, in the 1908–09 season, there were enough clubs from Wales to add a third Welsh League to the structure. The sole winner of this title was Merthyr Tydfil.\nThe Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues were abandoned in 1970.\nLancashire League.\nThe RFL Lancashire League was an annual competition from 1895 to 1970 for professional rugby league teams in Lancashire. Other teams from Cheshire and Cumbria also competed in the league. During the period 1896–1901 the county leagues were played as there was no national league championship during this period. After they were played alongside the RFL Championship until 1970. Teams also competed in the Lancashire Cup.\nTo keep the number of teams equal in both county leagues, clubs from Yorkshire were often invited to play in the Lancashire League. Halifax joined the Lancashire League in 1930, remaining there until the start of the Second World War. Following the demise of Belle Vue Rangers in 1955, it was initially decided that the Yorkshire League champions would compete in the Lancashire League during the following season, but clubs were later elected into the league on a voluntary basis instead.\nYorkshire League.\nThe RFL Yorkshire League was an annual competition from 1895 to 1970 for professional rugby league teams in Yorkshire. During the period 1896–1901 the county leagues were played as there was no national league championship during this period. After they were played alongside the RFL Championship until 1970. Teams also competed in the Yorkshire Cup."
