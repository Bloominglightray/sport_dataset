        "text": "William \"Pat\" Albert Harris (30 June 1876 – 15 June 1950) was a New Zealand rugby union player who represented the New Zealand national side in 1897. His position of choice was hooker. Harris did not play in any test matches as New Zealand did not play their first until 1903.\nCareer.\nHarris, more commonly known as \"Pat\", was born in Christchurch but played for the Union (now known as Alhambra-Union due to a merge of clubs) club in Dunedin.\nHe played 9 games for the Otago province between 1894 and 1896. The next year, in 1897 he appeared for the South Island in the inaugural North against South Island match.\nBased on this performance, Harris was chosen for the tour to Australia that year. He played in 8 out of the total 10 matches in Australia, including two out of the three of the unofficial tests against New South Wales.\nAfter the touring party had returned to New Zealand they played a final fixture against the Auckland province. The game was lost 11–10 and at the conclusion of the match there was an after-match gathering. Unfortunately for Harris he was found guilty of being intoxicated and using coarse language. He was thus banned from participating in any rugby union for two years.\nAfter his suspension had expired Harris did not reappear for his club or province again.\nPersonal and death.\nHarris may have worked as an engineer.\nHarris died on 15 June 1950 in Dunedin and was buried at Andersons Bay Cemetery."

        "title": "England 2006 FIFA World Cup bid",
        "text": "The England 2006 FIFA World Cup bid was the Football Association's unsuccessful bid for the right to host the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The other bids came from Brazil, South Africa, Morocco and successful bidder Germany.\nEngland hosted the 1966 FIFA World Cup and, had the campaign been successful, would have become the fourth nation to host the World Cup for a second time. The country had also hosted Euro 96 and unsuccessfully attempted to host the 1990 and 1998 World Cups.\nAmongst the bid submission delegation were 1966 World Cup winners Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst and then-current player Michael Owen.\nVenues.\nTo host a FIFA World Cup opening match, semi-final or final, a stadium must be able to hold 60,000 people.\nAt the heart of the 2006 bid was the new Wembley Stadium, with a capacity of 90,000. Old Trafford in Manchester held 61,000 in 2000, but had plans to expand to 68,400 by the time of the tournament, while the 1997-built Stadium of Light in Sunderland would also grow, from 42,000 at initial construction to 63,000 by 2006. New stadiums, at Ashburton Grove for Arsenal and Stanley Park Stadium for Liverpool, would be built to house over 60,000 fans each, while new grounds with capacities of more than 40,000 would also be built in Coventry (now known as the Coventry Building Society Arena) and Leicester (the Walkers Stadium). The City of Manchester Stadium, construction for which had begun in January 2000, would be used for both the 2002 Commonwealth Games and the 2006 FIFA World Cup as well as becoming the home ground of Manchester City, having been the centrepiece of an unsuccessful Mancunian bid to host the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nThe other existing stadiums that were nominated were Aston Villa's ground, Villa Park in Birmingham and St James' Park in Newcastle upon Tyne, both holding over 50,000, as well as 40,000-seater stadiums Pride Park in Derby, Leeds' Elland Road, Goodison Park in Liverpool, the Riverside Stadium in Middlesbrough, Hillsborough in Sheffield, and Stamford Bridge in West London.\na: Stadium used in 1966 FIFA World Cup\nb: Stadium used in UEFA Euro '96\nTimeline.\nIn 1993, the chairman of the Football Association (the FA), Bert Millichip and his German counterpart agreed that the FA would back Germany's bid for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and that Germany would support England's Euro 96 bid. Both bids were ultimately successful. By 1996, England had withdrawn its support for the Germany bid and decided to make their own bid, losing the support of UEFA president Lennart Johansson in the process. As a result, England put its support behind Sepp Blatter in 1998, rather than rival Johansson, for the FIFA presidency. Blatter had, however, already publicly supported South Africa's bid.\nThe FA went on to make a series of misinformed decisions to the detriment of the bid. This included FA chief executive Graham Kelly and chairman Keith Wiseman unsuccessfully attempting to remove the Scottish Football Association's David Will from the FIFA executive and replace him with Wiseman, culminating in both Kelly and Wiseman being removed from their posts. The FA, mindful of Thailand's vote on the 24-man executive, offered the Thailand national football team the services of Peter Withe as head coach.\nFive companies were names as sponsors of the bid: British Airways, Littlewoods, Marks &amp; Spencer, Nationwide Building Society and Umbro. A press advert was released by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in May 1998.\nIn 1999, England arranged a friendly with Malta before Euro 2000, securing England a vote. Later that year, Blatter reaffirmed his support for South Africa, despite a visit from British prime minister Tony Blair.\nIn April 1999, Bobby Charlton announced that as part of the bid, a dozen children from each of the 203 FIFA-affiliated nations would be guests of the FA during the tournament.\nThe 1998–99 FA Cup winners, Manchester United, withdrew from the 1999–2000 competition due to their participation in the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship in South America, to take place in early 2000, thus becoming the first FA Cup winners not to defend their title. This was at the request of the FA, which believed it would aid the 2006 bid. Tony Banks, the Minister for Sport, said he believed that the bid would receive \"irreparable damage\" if United did not partake in the maiden FIFA Club World Championship.\nOn 9 August 1999, the 2006 bid was presented to FIFA. The bid documentation was designed by Leeds-based firm Elmwood.\nIn May 2000, the bidding nations had representatives in Malaysia to present to the Asian Football Confederation.\nShortly before the 2000 UEFA Cup Final between English club Arsenal and Turkish side Galatasaray, there were clashes between British and Turkish fans. As well as Arsenal fans, it was reported that followers of English clubs Chelsea and Leeds United, as well as Scottish side Rangers and Welsh teams Cardiff City and Swansea City, had travelled to Copenhagen to engage with the Turks. This incident shocked UEFA deeply. These concerns intensified during Euro 2000, as there were hooligan riots caused by England fans and UEFA's stance against the English bid hardened as a result.\nOn 3 July 2000, Brazil withdrew its bid and pledged support for South Africa's. On the same day, the English bid was criticised by FIFA for the way in which it was conducted.\nOn 5 July, the countries made their final presentations to FIFA.\nResults.\nThe vote–undertaken in Zürich, Switzerland–took the instant-runoff voting format, where the lowest-placed nation is eliminated and their votes reassigned to their marked second preference, this process continuing for as many rounds as required for two nations to remain.\nNew Zealander Charlie Dempsey voted for England in both of the first two rounds, electing to abstain from the final round; \"Channel 4 News\" would name him as one of many to receive notes offering presents from members of bidding nations. David Will was the other man to back England twice. The three first-round English votes came from Central America.\nReaction.\nAndy Anson, the chief executive of the 2018 FIFA World Cup bid, called for humility with England's bid claiming they \"must not fall victim to arrogance\" and that lessons had been learned from the unsuccessful attempt to host the 2006 competition. Anson stated that \"the tone of this campaign has to be different."

        "text": "The Swedish men's handball champions (Swedish: \"Svenska mästare i handboll för herrar\") have been determined by three different competitions. From 1931–32 until 1951–52, the title was decided by a straight knockout tournament known as \"Svenska mästerskapet\" (\"the Swedish Championship\"). After 1934–35, it was played parallel to the highest league, Allsvenskan. The tournament was contested by the winners of the \"Distriktsmästerskap\" (\"Provincial Championships\") until 1945–46. After that it was contested by all teams from the top division, all Provincial Champions and invited teams from lower leagues. From 1952–53 until 1966–67, the title of Swedish Champions was awarded to the winners of Allsvenskan. Since 1967–68, the Swedish Champions have been determined by a playoffs competition between the highest-placed teams in the top league. Until 2003–04, all playoff rounds were decided by a series of home and away matches. Between 2004–05 and 2017–18 the final was played as a single match at a pre-determined venue. Since 2018–19, the final is again played as a series. The league changed its name to Elitserien in 1990–91 and to Handbollsligan in 2016–17.\nRedbergslid have won the most Swedish Championships with 20, followed by Drott at 11. These two clubs completely dominated Swedish men's handball from 1983–84 to 2002–03, winning all titles but one. They are followed by Kristianstad at 9 titles and four clubs at 7 titles: Heim, Hellas, Majorna and Sävehof. Majorna have won the title the most times in a row, winning it five times from 1942 to 1946. Västerås IK and AIK are the only teams to have won the championship (in its pre-1952 knockout format) while playing outside the top flight. Drott have been runners-up 12 times, more than any other team. Teams from the Gothenburg area (Redbergslid, Heim, Majorna and Sävehof) have won 41 of 91 titles. Since 1978, clubs from southern and western Götaland have won 42 of 45 titles, the other three being won by Stockholm club Hammarby.

        "title": "2018 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 2018 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Georgia Bulldogs, played on January 1, 2018 at the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, California. The 104th Rose Bowl Game was a semifinal for the College Football Playoff (CFP), matching two of the top four teams selected by the system's selection committee-Georgia of the SEC and Oklahoma of the Big 12. The Georgia Bulldogs won the game 54–48, with a 27-yard run by Sony Michel, shortly after Lorenzo Carter blocked Oklahoma Sooners' field goal attempt in the second overtime. The game lasted four hours and five minutes. Georgia advanced to face the winner of the Sugar Bowl (Alabama) in the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship game, to be played on January 8, 2018 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. With 26.8 million viewers on ESPN, the game ranked as the fifth most-viewed cable program of all time.\nThe game was one of the 2017–18 bowl games that concluded the 2017 FBS football season. It was televised on ESPN and ESPN Deportes, and broadcast on ESPN Radio and XM Satellite Radio, with the kickoff at 5 p.m. ET (2 p.m. local time). The Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association organized the game. Sponsored by the Northwestern Mutual financial services organization, the game was officially known as the College Football Playoff Semifinal at the Rose Bowl Game presented by Northwestern Mutual.\nPre-game activities.\nPre-game activities were held at the Rose Bowl parking lots and at Brookside Golf Course. The 2017 Rose Bowl Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony was held at the Rose Bowl Stadium Lot K on December 30, 2017 from 12:00 to 1:30 p.m.. The 2017 Class members were Mack Brown (Texas), Cade McNown (UCLA), Charles Woodson (Michigan) and Dr. Charles West (Washington &amp; Jefferson), represented by his daughter.\nPre-game Rose Parade.\nThe 2018 Rose Parade started at 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time and featured floral floats, marching bands, and equestrian units marching down the 5.5 mile route of the parade down Colorado Boulevard.\nThe 2018 Rose Parade's theme was “Making A Difference,” and actor Gary Sinise was its Grand Marshal.\nPre-game buildup.\nTeam selection.\nIn the 2018 Rose Bowl, the #2-ranked Oklahoma Sooners, champions of the Big 12 Conference, faced the #3-ranked Georgia Bulldogs, champions of the Southeastern Conference. This was the first meeting between the University of Georgia and the University of Oklahoma football teams.\nTraditionally, the Rose Bowl pits the winners of the Big Ten Conference and Pac-12 Conference. However, any teams may be selected every three years, when the Rose Bowl is a CFP semifinal. The Big 12 and SEC champions traditionally meet in the Sugar Bowl. The 2018 Sugar Bowl was used as the other semifinal this year, allowing any team to be selected.\nAs a result of Oklahoma and Georgia making it to the Rose Bowl, it was the first time since the 2015 Rose Bowl (CFP Semifinal) that the Big Ten Conference was not featured in the game. It was the first time since the 2011 edition that the Pac-12 Conference was not featured. It was the first time since the 2006 edition (BCS National Championship Game) in which one of the participants was a Power 5 team outside of the two traditional conferences. That same 2006 game was also the last time the Big 12 Conference appeared in the Rose Bowl until 2018. It was also the first time since the 1946 Rose Bowl that an SEC appeared in the game. Lastly, it was the first time since the 2002 edition of the bowl game (also a BCS National Championship Game) that neither the Big Ten Conference nor the Pac-12 Conference was in the Rose Bowl (Nebraska was still in the Big 12 at the time).\nThe matchups for the semifinals are geographically selected to ensure the top two teams do not play in road environments. More than one team from the same conference may participate in the game, and avoiding rematches is not a selection factor.\nExperience in the Rose Bowl.\nGeorgia won their only previous Rose Bowl appearance when their 1942 team, which claims a national championship, beat the Pacific Coast Conference (predecessor to the Pac-12) champion UCLA 9–0 in 1943, a matchup which occurred prior to the Big Nine-PCC agreement. Oklahoma won their only previous Rose Bowl appearance when their 2002 team beat the then Pac-10 champion Washington State 34–14 in 2003, a matchup which occurred since Big Ten champion Ohio State was selected for the Fiesta Bowl, which was being used as that year's BCS National Championship Game, and Oklahoma was selected to replace them.\nGeorgia.\nGeorgia opened the 2017 season as the No. 15 team in both the AP and Coaches Polls. In the season opener, the Georgia Bulldogs faced the Appalachian State Mountaineers. During the first quarter, starting quarterback Jacob Eason was injured in an out-of-bounds hit that strained his knee. Freshman quarterback Jake Fromm replaced Eason. Fromm started as quarterback the rest of the season.\nGeorgia traveled to its first away and out-of-conference game against the No. 24 Notre Dame Fighting Irish on September 9, 2017. The score was back-and-forth the whole game, until Rodrigo Blankenship scored a field goal with 3:34 to go in the fourth quarter, giving Georgia a 20–19 lead. On 1st-and-10, Georgia linebacker Davin Bellamy sacked quarterback Brandon Wimbush, and forced a fumble, which Georgia's Lorenzo Carter recovered. The Bulldogs held the field, winning the game. The Bulldogs returned home for the next two weeks, beating the Samford Bulldogs 42–14 and the No.17 Mississippi State Bulldogs 31–3.\nOn September 30, 2017, No. 7 Georgia traveled to Knoxville to play longtime SEC East rival the Tennessee Volunteers after losing to them at home in 2016. The Bulldogs defeated the Volunteers in a 41–0 shutout, which was Tennessee's worst home loss since 1905. The following week, Georgia returned to Tennessee to play the Vanderbilt Commodores, winning 45–14. Undefeated No. 4 Georgia faced the Missouri Tigers back home in Athens, winning 53–28. During that game, Georgia gained 696 total yards, the second-highest in school history. When Georgia faced their biggest rival, the Florida Gators, in the annual neutral-location game, Georgia remained undefeated and beat Florida 42–7, the biggest win in the rivalry since 1982. After Florida's loss to Georgia, they fired head coach Jim McElwain. The following week, Georgia beat the South Carolina Gamecocks 24–10, clinching the SEC East and their spot in the SEC Championship.\nOn November 11, 2017, Georgia lost to the Auburn Tigers 17–40 in what would be their only loss of the regular season. Georgia wrapped up the regular season by beating the Kentucky Wildcats 42–13 and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets 38–7. On December 2, 2017, No.6 Georgia joined No. 4 Auburn in the SEC Championship, the only team who beat them during the regular season. In the rematch, Georgia took the lead in the second quarter when Georgia linebacker Davin Bellamy stripped the ball from Auburn quarterback Jarrett Stidham, recovered by Roquan Smith and leading to Georgia's drive that tied the score. Georgia took the SEC title for the first time since 2005, almost certainly securing their spot in the playoffs.\nOklahoma.\nIn the 2017 preseason polls, Oklahoma was ranked No. 7 in the AP Poll and No. 8 in the Coaches Poll. Oklahoma opened the season against the University of Texas at El Paso Miners, winning 56–7 and showcasing a strong offense. Next, No. 6 Oklahoma traveled to the No. 2 Ohio State Buckeyes and won 31–16. In Oklahoma's first meeting with the Tulane Green Wave, No. 2 Oklahoma won 56–14. They went on to play the Baylor Bears, eking out an expected blowout but still winning 49–41.\nIn Oklahoma's big upset of the season, they lost to the Iowa State Cyclones 31–38. They went on to beat the Texas Longhorns 29–24 after Texas recovered from a 20-point deficit. The Sooners also began the next game against the Kansas State Wildcats with a 14-point deficit in the first half, but in a second-half comeback, Rodney Anderson scored a 22-yard touchdown with seven seconds left in the game, winning 42–35. Against the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Mayfield led the team to a 49–27 victory.\nOklahoma met the Oklahoma State Cowboys for their annual rivalry game, and quarterback Baker Mayfield completed 598 yards, winning 62–52. The No. 5 Sooners beat the No. 6 Texas Christian University Horned Frogs 38–20, taking 1st place in the Big 12. In the next away game against the Kansas Jayhawks, Mayfield accounted for his 127th touchdown, breaking Landry Jones's record as completing the most touchdowns in school history, and they won the game 41–3. During the game, Mayfield lost his captaincy for the following game against the West Virginia Mountaineers when he screamed profanity and grabbed his crotch, which he directed at the Kansas sideline. Mayfield's replacement, Kyler Murray, started the game, but Mayfield returned and won 59–31.\nOn December 2, 2017, No. 2 Oklahoma joined No. 10 TCU in a rematch in the Big 12 Championship, winning 41–17. The game secured Oklahoma's spot in the College Football Playoff semifinals.\nGame summary.\nOklahoma scored on five of six possessions in the first half, and they entered halftime leading Georgia by 14 points.\nThe 54–48 score made this the highest-scoring Rose Bowl, edging out 2017's University of Southern California 52–49 win over Penn State.\nFirst quarter.\nAfter winning the coin toss, Oklahoma elected to defer and kick off. Georgia was forced to punt the ball on the first drive of the game, giving Oklahoma its first possession. Oklahoma's quarterback Baker Mayfield completed three passes, the third to Marquise Brown in the end zone, scoring the first touchdown of the day.\nSecond quarter.\nSony Michel rushed for a 75-yard touchdown.\nAt the end of the second quarter, the Sooners employed a double reverse, and Baker Mayfield caught his first pass in college to score a 2-yard touchdown.\nGeorgia received its possession with only 6 seconds on the clock, and Rodrigo Blankenship scored a 55-yard field goal. Blankenship set a Rose Bowl record for longest field goal kick.\nThird quarter.\nThe Sooners led 31–17 at halftime but the Bulldogs scored fourteen unanswered points in the third quarter.\nFourth quarter.\nThe game went back and forth in the last quarter. Baker Mayfield threw the first interception of the game, as Dominick Sanders intercepted his pass. Jake Fromm completed a 4-yard pass to Javon Wims, taking the lead for the first time in the game, at 38–31.\nOklahoma tied the game back up, with Dimitri Flowers scoring a touchdown with 8:47 left in the game. Sony Michel fumbled in the next possession, and Oklahoma's Steven Parker recovered the fumble and returned it 46 yards to score a touchdown, putting the Sooners in the lead again.\nWith fifty-five seconds left in the game, Nick Chubb took a direct snap and rushed for two yards for a game-tying touchdown. Oklahoma did not score on its last drive of regulation game, forcing overtime.\nFirst overtime.\nThe game went into overtime and was the first Rose Bowl in history to do so. The Sooners won the overtime coin toss and elected to play defense first. The teams traded field goals in the first overtime, sending the game into a second overtime.\nSecond overtime.\nGeorgia's Lorenzo Carter blocked Oklahoma kicker Austin Seibert's 27-yard field goal attempt, meaning Georgia would win the game with any points during its possession. When Georgia had the ball, Sony Michel took a direct snap on a second down and rushed for a 27-yard touchdown, winning the game for the Bulldogs.\nRose Bowl records.\nIn this game, five Rose Bowl records were set:"

From 1929–1935 he was an assistant coach with the Yale Bulldogs.\nVaughan began coaching Princeton Tigers ice hockey team in 1935 and promptly raised the level of completion from a poor outing the previous year. The Tigers could not sustain the success and oscillated around the .500 mark for the next seven years. While the program was closed for two years during World War II, Vaughan was retained as head coach and resumed his work once the team returned to action in January 1946 (some sources list no coach for that abbreviated year). The post-war Tigers were not quite as good as their earlier iterations: Vaughan's squads hovered just below an even record for much of the time. He left in 1959 and was replaced by R. Norman Wood.\nDuring the early part of his career, Vaughan published a book entitled \"Hockey\" which has since gone out of print.\nPersonal life.\nVaughan was the son of Baptist theologian Richard Miner Vaughan.\nHead coaching record.\nVaughan's record as college head coach is:"

        "title": "Tooting, Merton and Wimbledon Railway",
        "text": "The Tooting, Merton and Wimbledon Railway (TM&amp;WR) was a railway company jointly operated by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) and the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in Surrey (now south-west London).\nNetwork.\nThe TM&amp;WR comprised two lines:\nAt Wimbledon the TM&amp;WR shared the WCR station, a little to the southwest of the main LSWR station. On the arrival of the TM&amp;WR the LBSCR facilities were expanded to two platforms, 5 and 6. Tooting Junction station was sited across the divergence of the Wimbledon and Merton branches, with a pair of platform faces for each. On opening Lower Merton station had platforms only on the Tooting line.\nIt was double track throughout, including the doubling of the WCR from Lower Merton to Wimbledon, which had previously been single.\nHistory.\nThe Wandle Valley had long established industries that prompted the building of the Surrey Iron Railway, later developed into the WCR. The Merton Abbey copper mill and supporting trades were close to that corridor but not directly served by the WCR.\nIn the 1860s the LBSCR was expanding its South London suburban network, and proposed the TM&amp;WR to link their Peckham Rye to Sutton route with the LSWR, and attract goods traffic from the Merton Abbey industries. It was established as an independent company by Act of Parliament in 1864, but vested jointly in the LSWR and LBSCR a year later. It opened on 1 October 1868, concurrently with the Peckham Rye-Sutton line. Initial LBSCR services ran from both ways round the loop. After a year the LSWR began a service from Kingston to (near ) via Tooting, beginning a long association between the Wimbledon branch and the LCDR City line.\nIn 1870 a platform was added to Lower Merton station for the Croydon line, and it was renamed Merton Park. In 1889 the LSWR relocated Wimbledon station to the other side of Wimbledon Bridge for the opening of the District Railway branch. The TM&amp;WR and W&amp;CR were then brought into the shared station with an island platform next to the South West Main Line, at roughly the location of what is now platforms 9 and 10. Also in 1889, Haydens Lane station was renamed Haydons Road.\nIn 1894 Tooting Junction was relocated to the other side of Mitcham Road, with just two platform faces for all services, although the original station building remained until the 1980s. By the early 20th century the LBSCR was running services from Wimbledon to London Bridge via both sides of the loop, and from Tooting to Victoria using the LSWR mainline between Wimbledon and Clapham Junction.\nInterwar period.\nAfter The Great War the TM&amp;WR and connected LBSCR &amp; LSWR lines were merged into the Southern Railway. The rapid expansion of electric trams in South London diverted passenger traffic away from these small suburban lines. LCC Tram No's 2, 4, 10 and 30 paralleled various sections of the TM&amp;WR and WCR, and running on the streets they were more useful for local travel. In 1926 the City &amp; South London Railway extended their underground line to Morden, with stations at Colliers Wood and South Wimbledon, close to Merton Abbey and Merton Park stations respectively. The C&amp;SLR provided a direct service to the City and West End (via the Charing Cross, Euston &amp; Hampstead Railway), with stations more conveniently placed for commuters.\nThe TM&amp;WR and WCR system was left only with passengers connecting to the mainlines, and goods traffic from Merton Abbey and Waddon Marsh. The Merton Abbey branch was closed to passenger traffic in 1929. As new works opened in the Merton Abbey area freight continued to be profitable, with coal inward and finished products out; private sidings were added to the branch to handle the traffic.\nDecline.\nIn 1934 the Merton Abbey branch was singled, the connection at Tooting was broken and the goods service operated via Merton Park only. After the Second World War several of the factories closed. The steady rise of road transport eroded what was left of the goods traffic. The nationalised railway could not support such an underused line, and the branch was closed completely and lifted in 1975.\nThe remaining Wimbledon branch kept its passenger service from via and , continuing the LBSCR practice. From 1930 it ran through to the Wimbledon and Sutton Railway (WSR) and thence to West Croydon. That service was not an outstanding success, and later the WSR service was diverted at Sutton to return to Streatham via Mitcham Junction, forming the Sutton Loop Line still operating today.\nFrom the 1960s service frequencies were scaled back; by the 1980s the weekday off-peak service was 2tph each way, 1tph on Saturdays, and no Sunday service.\nRedeployment.\nIn the late 1980s the Sutton Loop was taken over by Thameslink. The unexpected popularity of this new cross-London service led to weekend services being restored and new longer trains being provided. For many years the Thameslink services were supplemented with some Southern services to London Bridge during weekday rush-hours, but these no longer run.\nIn the 1990s the Merton Abbey industrial area was re-developed as a retail park. Part of the Merton Park - Merton Abbey - Tooting Junction trackbed became Merantun Way, diverting the A24 trunk road to bypass Merton High Street. The site of Merton Abbey station is now occupied by a roundabout midway along Merantun Way and a petrol station.\nIn 1997 the WCR was converted to a grade-separated tram line (the Croydon Tramlink), and the site of Merton Park station is now occupied by a tram stop of the same name."

        "title": "Ernie Mills (rugby league)",
        "text": "Ernie \"Bigga\" Mills (1904–1983) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played professionally in England as a for Huddersfield before a severe injury ended his playing career at only age 31.\nEarly life.\nMills was born in Bigga, New South Wales and after attending the local primary school went to high school in Goulburn before attending college in Sydney where he trained as a teacher. His rugby league career began with local teams in Bigga and Goulburn. After completing his college course Mills took a teaching post in Grenfell, New South Wales where he played for the local rugby team.\nProfessional rugby career.\nAt various times during the early decades of the 20th century there was a ban on British rugby league teams signing players from outside the United Kingdom. The most recent ban dated from 1923 and existed because of fears from the Australian league authorities that the best players would be attracted to play in Britain rather than stay at home and develop the game at home. By 1927 the British clubs wanted the ban lifting and in June 1927 the ban was lifted. The Grenfell team were at this time coached by Huddersfield player, Ben Gronow. Gronow recommended Mills to Huddersfield and with days of the transfer ban being lifted Mills had signed a contract with Huddersfield and arrived in England in time for the start of the 1927–28 season.\nMills scored his first try for Huddersfield on his debut, scoring the only points of the game, a 3–0 victory over Castleford on 27 August 1927.\nFor the 1927–28 season and the following five seasons Mills was to be Huddersfield's top try scorer and for two seasons, 1928–29 and 1931–32 he was the league's top try scorer.\nMills played and won in two Championship finals, 1928–29 (2–0 vs Leeds), and 1929–30 (10–0 in a replay against Leeds after a 2–2 draw). Huddersfield won the Yorkshire League in the same two seasons.\nIn 1931 Mills won a Yorkshire Cup winners medal as Huddersfield beat Hunslet 4–2 in the 1931–32 Yorkshire Cup final at Headingley.\nThe quartet of winning all four different cups was completed in 1933 as Mills was a member of the team that triumphed in the 1932–33 Challenge Cup final and he scored a try as Huddersfield beat Warrington 21–17 at Wembley on 6 May 1933.\nDuring the 1934–35 season Mills requested a transfer from Huddersfield and was placed on the transfer list with a fee of £600, but before any transfer was agreed Mills was injured playing against Bradford Northern in April 1935. Mills did not play for the rest of the season and despite surgery, the injury was so severe that Mills was advised to retire from playing at the end of 1935.\nIn total Mills made 386 appearances for Huddersfield, scoring 288 tries, and in a sport where injuries were common played 123 consecutive games between 28 December 1929 and 5 September 1932.\nMills was never considered for selection for the Australian national team and the only representative honours he achieved were to play twice for the Other Nationalities against England in 1929 and 1930, his only international try being scored in the 1930 game.\nTeaching career.\nMills held several teaching posts in England both while playing rugby and after his retirement from the game. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s he was in charge of the youth section of a training centre for unemployed young people in Huddersfield.\nPersonal life.\nMills was married three times. The first marriage was to Edna Naylor in July 1926 in Sydney. In 1931 she petitioned for divorce on the basis of Mills's desertion of her by his move to England to play rugby. They had one child. In August 1932 Mills married Marie Johnson in England. By 1951 Mills and Johnson has divorced and Mills married for a third time to Vera Shaw in Lancaster, Lancashire, England. Mills and Shaw and his children by Johnson and Shaw returned to Australia in 1953. He continued to teach until retirement and died in 1983."

        "title": "Mike Schultz (American football)",
        "text": "Mike Schultz (born January 3, 1958) is an American football coach. Hired on December 21, 2016 to replace Ray Woodard, he was the second head coach of the Lamar Cardinals football program since its resurrection for the 2010 season.\nSchultz graduated from Sam Houston State University in 1979, after which he worked as a quarterbacks and running backs coach at the university. After spending the next two decades in several other assistant coaching positions, Schultz became the offensive coordinator at TCU in 2000, a post he held through the 2008 season. He then served as the OC at Illinois and Middle Tennessee for the 2009 and 2010 seasons, respectively, before moving back to Texas to hold the same position at Texas State under returning head coach Dennis Franchione from 2011 to 2015. The 2017 season at Lamar was Schultz's first as head coach.\nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career.\nSchultz held numerous assistant coaching positions after his graduation from Sam Houston in 1979, starting as a recruiting coordinator and linebackers coach at the university that season before switching to quarterbacks and receivers the next. In his next two positions, at UTEP and Kansas State, he also served as a recruiting coordinator, as well as a receivers and tight ends coach. After two seasons as a running backs and secondary coach at Tennessee Tech and a year under Fred Akers at Texas, Schultz spent the next four years at Westwood High School in Round Rock, Texas as an assistant and defensive coordinator.\nSchultz returned to collegiate coaching in 1990, working under Dennis \"Coach Fran\" Franchione at then-Southland Conference member Southwest Texas State (now Texas State) for two seasons as a running backs and secondary coach, then moving to the University of New Mexico to hold the same position from 1992-1997 when Franchione was hired as head coach there. During Schultz's tenure at UNM, the Lobos earned the WAC Mountain Division Championship and an invitation to the 1997 Insight.com Bowl, the Lobos' first bowl appearance in nearly four decades. After that season, \"Coach Fran\" was hired at Texas Christian, and Schultz returned to Texas to serve as TCU's running game coordinator. The Horned Frogs went 7-5 for the 1998 season, just a year after producing a 1-11 record, and earned a berth into the Sun Bowl in which they produced 314 rushing yards and defeated the USC Trojans 28-19. TCU earned conference co-champion honors for both the 1998 and 1999 seasons.\nOffensive coordinator.\nTCU.\nWhen Franchione was hired as the head coach at Alabama for the 2001 season, TCU's defensive coordinator Gary Patterson took the reins as head coach (a position he held until near the end of the 2021 season), and Mike Schultz was promoted to offensive coordinator. The Horned Frogs continued their improvement, and ended the 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2008 seasons ranked in the Top 25 by both the AP and Coaches' polls. Schultz's dominant offenses set several school records, and the Horned Frogs consistently ranked high nationally in terms of offensive production. On the backbone of the offensive power cultivated by Schultz, TCU switched conferences three times during head coach Patterson's tenure, moving from the WAC to Conference USA in 2001, joining the Mountain West Conference in 2005 and winning championship honors, and finally switching to the Big 12 in 2012.\nIn addition to constructing a commanding offensive foundation, Schultz was also important in the development of standout players at TCU. Under Schultz's tutelage, running back LaDainian Tomlinson had his two best seasons as a Horned Frog, setting the FBS single-game record with 406 rushing yards against UTEP in 1999 and leading the NCAA with 1,850 yards in 1999 and 2,158 in 2000. Tomlinson's total of 5,263 rushing yards is a TCU record, and he won the Doak Walker Award his senior season in addition to being a Heisman Trophy finalist. After leaving the university, Tomlinson was picked fifth overall in the NFL draft, and he was later honored as the NFL's Most Valuable Player in 2006, having accrued 1,815 rushing yards and a record 28 touchdowns that season. Counting Tomlinson's two seasons separately, Schultz presided over an unprecedented five 1,000-yard rushers at TCU, more than doubling the number the school saw in its entire football history. Several years later, Schultz again demonstrated his ability to develop young players when working with future NFL star Andy Dalton. A redshirt freshman, Dalton was named the Horned Frogs' starting quarterback prior to the 2007 season, and went on to throw 10 touchdowns that season and 11 the next, amassing over 2,200 yards each year on near-60% completion ratios. Even after Schultz left, Dalton continued his success, and he went on to throw for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three NFL seasons.\nIllinois.\nAfter his departure from TCU, Schultz took the offensive coordinator position at Illinois for the 2009 season. Despite high preseason expectations, the Illini failed to produce much success with their option/spread offensive scheme, and they finished the season 3-9, the fourth losing season during then-head coach Ron Zook's tenure.\nMiddle Tennessee.\nMike Schultz joined the staff at Middle Tennessee as offensive coordinator for the 2010 season, running a spread offense which had moderately more success than his previous team. The Blue Raiders finished the season 6-7 overall, but 5-3 in Sun Belt Conference play, and the team was invited to the 2011 GoDaddy.com Bowl where they were defeated by the Miami Redhawks.\nTexas State.\nSchultz returned to Texas State University with former head coach Dennis Franchione in 2011, when the university was transitioning from FCS to FBS classification. Schultz rejoined the staff at Texas State as the offensive coordinator, and he helped the Bobcats post a 6-6 record, including a 46-21 win against his future team, the Lamar Cardinals. For 2012, the Bobcats' first year in the FBS and only year as members of the WAC, the Bobcats finished 4-8, 2-4 in conference play. Texas State moved to the Sun Belt Conference in the following year and posted a 6-6 overall record. The 2014 season was the program's best under Schultz's tenure, and the Bobcats finished the season 7–5 overall with a 5–3 conference record to cement a three-way tie for fourth place. Although eligible, they were not selected to participate in a bowl game; the Bobcats were the only eligible 7–5 FBS team not to receive a bowl bid.\nHead coach.\nLamar.\nSchultz was hired by Lamar University on December 21, 2016 to replace former head coach Ray Woodard. During the 2017 season, Schultz's first as head coach, the Cardinals won two of their 11 games with a 1–8 Southland Conference record. Schultz was fired at the conclusion of the 2019 season which the Cardinals finished 4-8"

        "text": "The 2018–19 FIA World Endurance Championship was the seventh season of the FIA World Endurance Championship, an auto racing series co-organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series is open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars divided into four categories. The season marked the first move to a winter schedule for the championship, with the season starting at the Circuit de Spa-Francorchamps in May 2018 and concluding at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in June 2019. World championship titles were awarded for LMP drivers, GTE drivers, LMP1 teams and GTE manufacturers.\nSchedule.\nThe series announced a provisional schedule on 1 September 2017 that shifted the season calendar from a spring to autumn layout with the 24 Hours of Le Mans marque event held in the middle of the championship, to one running from the May 2018 and to June 2019, including two runnings of Le Mans. This \"super season\" of eight races spans across more than a year instead of the usual eight months. This shift in calendar length allows the following 2019–20 season to return to a shorter length by starting in the autumn and concluding at Le Mans in the summer.\nThe schedule does not include the Circuit of the Americas, Bahrain, Mexico City, or the Nürburgring which were all part of the 2017 championship. In addition to Le Mans being included in both 2018 and 2019, the 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps is also run twice. Sebring International Raceway returns to the series for the first time since the inaugural season in 2012, although the WEC does not participate in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship's 12 Hours of Sebring. The WeatherTech series runs their race the day after WEC's 8-hour, 1,000-mile event.\nThe schedule was revised two weeks later with the announcement of the eighth round of the championship, returning to Silverstone Circuit in the United Kingdom. The unannounced event was originally planned for February 2019, with negotiations taking place over a return to Mexico City. With the Mexico City deal failing to materialize, the event at Silverstone was moved to August 2018 to bridge the gap between Le Mans and the Asian rounds of the series starting in October. Further, the Fuji and Shanghai rounds had their dates changed, however Fuji was later returned to its originally scheduled date.\nTeams and drivers.\nLMP2.\nIn accordance with the Le Mans Prototype LMP2 regulations for 2017, all cars use the Gibson GK428 4.2 L V8 engine.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nDrivers' championships.\nFour titles are offered to drivers, two with world championship status. The LMP World Endurance Drivers' Championship is reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers while the GTE World Endurance Drivers' Championship is available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. FIA Endurance Trophies are awarded in LMP2 and in LMGTE Am.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point was awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car for each category in qualifying. Furthermore, a race must complete two laps under green flag conditions in order for championship points to be awarded.\nManufacturers' and teams' championships.\nA world championship for LMGTE manufacturers is awarded, while the former title for manufacturers in LMP1 has been replaced by a world championship for LMP1 teams. FIA Endurance Trophies are awarded for LMP2 and LMGTE Am teams, while the former trophy for LMGTE Pro teams had been eliminated for 2018.\nWorld Endurance LMP1 Championship.\nPoints are awarded only for the highest finishing competitor from each team.\nWorld Endurance GTE Manufacturers' Championship.\nThe two highest finishing competitors from each manufacturer are awarded points."

Practices officially began in September 29, 2017.\nConference membership changes.\nThree schools joined new conferences for the 2017–18 season.\nIn addition to the schools changing conferences, the 2017–18 season was the last for four schools in their then-current conferences:\nArenas.\nTemporary arenas.\nFour Division I women's teams played the 2017–18 season in temporary homes due to renovation of their current venues. A fifth played in a temporary home following the demolition of its previous venue to accommodate a new arena.\nPreseason polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls\nRegular season.\nEarly preseason tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, an \"upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences ends its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding. The winners of these tournaments receive automatic invitations to the 2018 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nOf the major selectors in women's basketball, the AP and USBWA divide their selections into separate teams, but the 2017–18 season was the first in which the USBWA did so. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), continues the USBWA's former practice of selecting a single 10-member (plus ties) team. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nSeveral teams changed coaches during and after the season."

The event was the 41st edition of the UK Championship, first held in 1977, organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. It was the eleventh ranking and first Triple Crown event of the 2017/2018 season. The event saw 128 players compete, with no qualification round. The prize fund was a total of £850,000, with £170,000 received by the winner.\nRonnie O'Sullivan equalled Steve Davis's record of six UK titles by defeating Shaun Murphy 10–5 in the final. This was O'Sullivan's 31st ranking and 18th Triple Crown title, also equalling Stephen Hendry's record for most Triple Crown championships. Mark Selby was the defending champion, but he was defeated by Scott Donaldson 3–6 in the last 64. Michael White won the highest break prize, with a 142 made in the second round. The event followed the Northern Ireland Open, and preceded the Scottish Open.\nPrize fund.\nThe championship's prize money was identical to that of the previous year's event, with the event winner earning £170,000. The highest prize of £5,000 was won by Michael White, who completed a 142 break during his second round match with Matthew Selt. The \"rolling 147 prize\" for a maximum break stood at £15,000, but went unclaimed. The breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nThe 2017 UK Championship was the eleventh ranking and first Triple Crown event of the 2017/2018 snooker season. The event saw 128 players from the World Snooker Tour take part, with all matches until the final being played as best of 11 matches, with the final being played as best of 19 frame match, held over two sessions. The first round of the competition started on 28 November 2017, with players being seeded according to their world rankings.\nEarly rounds (first–fourth round).\nThe first round saw few upsets, with most of the highest ranked players progressing. However, Ding Junhui (second seed) was defeated by world number 130 Leo Fernandez 6–5, despite having led 5–1, and having a chance to win the match in frame 7. Fernandez had only recently returned to the professional circuit after serving a 15-month ban for a corruption charge. Elsewhere, Ali Carter (11th seed) lost 6–2 to Jimmy White (118). Despite Carter having been ahead 2–1, White won the next five frames to progress. Another upset saw Lyu Haotian (104) defeat Anthony Hamilton (25) 6–1.\nThe second round of the tournament was played from 2–3 December and began with defending champion, and world number one Mark Selby losing to Scott Donaldson (64) 3–6. Donaldson had lost all 10 matches of his season prior to the tournament, won six of the last seven frames to win the match, having trailed 0–2.\nThe remaining top 16 players progressed through the second round, with the lowest ranked player to proceed being Lyu – ranked 104 – who defeated Peter Ebdon 6–3 to reach the third round.\nRound three was played between the remaining 32 players, from 4–5 December 2017, seeing more top 16 players be defeated. Graeme Dott (30) overcame Judd Trump (3) 6–2, despite trailing 2–0. Dott compiled five 50+ breaks, and won the next six frames. Hoatian who had defeated Hamilton and Ebdon in prior round, defeated Marco Fu (8) 6–4. Both Neil Robertson (9) and Mark Williams (16) were also defeated at this stage, 5–6. Robertson was defeated by Mark Joyce (41), and caused him to miss the 2018 Masters, after dropping out of the top 16, thanks to the loss. Sunny Akani (87) whitewashed Barry Hawkins (10) 6–0, with Hawkins commenting after the match that he was \"in a state of shock\" with the result, commenting on both Akani's performance, and the poor playing conditions. Williams lost to fellow Welshman Ryan Day (17), having been ahead at 4–1.\nRound four saw the remaining sixteen players play from 6–7 December 2017. Only four top 16 seeded players reached the last 16 of the tournament – John Higgins (4), Shaun Murphy (5), Mark Allen (6) and Ronnie O'Sullivan (7). This was the fewest top 16 seeds to reach that stage in the tournament's 40-year history. Higgins played Mark King (21), where he was defeated 5–6. King trailed at both 2–4, and 4–5 but won the match despite making a highest break of just 69.&lt;ref name=\"king/Higgins\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy would defeat Ricky Walden 6–1, with Walden only winning frame four. Mark Allen lost to Joe Perry (22) 6–4. O'Sullivan played Sunny Akani in this round, winning the match 6–5, despite being 4–5 behind. O'Sullivan commented after the match that he felt as though he had \"robbed\" Akani of the win, describing him as being unlucky.\nLater stages (quarter-finals–final).\nThe quarter-finals took place on 8 December 2017 on two tables. Shaun Murphy completed a 6–1 victory over Mark King. Post-match, both Murphy and King commented on the audience, with a man being removed for snoring and a woman for talking during the match. Ronnie O'Sullivan defeated Martin Gould 6–3, after leading 5–0.\nStephen Maguire defeated Joe Perry 6–3 to set up a semi-final match with O'Sullivan, in a repeat of the 2007 UK Championship final. After beating Maguire in 2007, O'Sullivan commented that Maguire would \"dominate for a decade\". Reacting to the match from 10 years prior, Maguire stated that O'Sullivan \"talks some bollocks\", having not dominated the game since that match. Ryan Day also overcame Mark Joyce in a deciding frame 6–5.\nThe semi-finals were played on 9 December 2017. The first semi-final saw O'Sullivan defeat Maguire 6–4. O'Sullivan took a 4–0 lead at the interval, before Maguire won four of the next five frames, with O'Sullivan winning the match in frame ten. The second semi-final saw Shaun Murphy overcome Ryan Day 6–3. Murphy would take a 5–1 lead, before losing the next two frames, and winning the match in frame nine.\nThe final was played as best of 19 frames, over two sessions on 10 December 2017. Both O'Sullivan and Murphy had met in the final of the 2017 Champion of Champions the month prior, with Murphy winning 10–8. Murphy and O'Sullivan would share the first session 4–4, despite Murphy being behind at 2–4. In the second session, O'Sullivan put together six 50+ breaks including two to win six of the next seven frames to win the match 10–5, winning five frames in a row.\nPost match, pundit John Parrott described O'Sullivan as \"a genius of a juggernaut\", commenting on the impressiveness of the clinical win. The win would be O'Sullivan's sixth UK Championship victory equalling that achieved by Steve Davis, and his 18th Triple Crown victory overall, equalling the record set by Stephen Hendry.\nMain draw.\nBelow is the results for the tournament. Players in bold denote winners of matches. The player's seedings are based on the player's world ranking prior to the tournament.\nCentury breaks.\nA total of 99 breaks were made at the event, the highest of which – a 142 – was made by Michael White in the second round.\nSponsorship and broadcasting.\nThe event was sponsored by betting company Betway, sponsors of the UK Championship since 2015.

        "title": "Alphabetical cricket teams",
        "text": "Between 1786 and 1833, eight first-class matches were played by teams which were apparently selected alphabetically, though not always by design. For example, a match might have players with surnames beginning A to K on one side and players with surnames beginning L to Z on the other. It is possible that other similar matches were played to c.1825 but, if so, the records have not survived. The idea has not been repeated at first-class level since 1833.\n1786.\nIn August 1786, a match at Moulsey Hurst was played between teams from Hampshire (organised by the Hambledon Club) and Kent, the venue in Surrey being neutral. The main source for the match is Arthur Haygarth's \"Scores &amp; Biographies\" (S&amp;B). Haygarth reports a curiosity in that the Kent XI \"consisted entirely of A's, B's and C's\" and he says that, \"in another account\" (possibly \"Grand Matches of Cricket 1771 to 1791\" by W. Epps), \"the two sides are called A, B and C's v. the rest of the Alphabet\". Haygarth, who often complained in S&amp;B about inconsistent titling of matches, adds that the Hambledon Club's \"Old Scores\" scorebook calls the match \"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\" \"versus\" \"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\" but he rejects this and states that \"it is decidedly a match between Hambledon Club (Hampshire) and Kent\". His title is \"Hambledon Club, with Lumpy \"versus\" Kent, with Bedster\". In its \"Important Matches\" guide, the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (ACS) calls the match \"ABC v Rest of Alphabet\". \"CricketArchive\" agrees with the ACS and has called the match \"A to C v Rest of the Alphabet\".\n1787 to 1789.\nAccording to \"CricketArchive\" (CA), teams called \"A to M\" and \"N to Z\" played each other five times in three seasons from 1787. The main secondary source for the five matches is again S&amp;B which calls the two teams \"Earl of Winchilsea's Side\" and \"Sir Horace (Horatio) Mann's Side\". There is nothing in S&amp;B to suggest that the teams were organised alphabetically. Furthermore, the so-called \"A to M\" teams included Tom Taylor and the \"N to Z\" included James Aylward and William Fennex. CA claims that these were given men and also that the two patrons evidently alternated between the teams, which would put Winchilsea into \"A to M\" and Mann into \"N to Z\". The S&amp;B version is supported by the ACS.\n1831 to 1833.\nTwo A to K \"versus\" L to Z matches were played in 1831 and 1833. These were genuine alphabetical matches. They were both played at Lord's by teams of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) members supplemented by leading professionals including Jem Broadbridge, William Lillywhite, Fuller Pilch and Ned Wenman. The 1833 match was 12-a-side."

        "title": "Badminton railway line",
        "text": "The Badminton railway line is a railway line opened in 1903 by the Great Western Railway between the Great Western Main Line at Wootton Bassett in Wiltshire and Patchway and Filton, north of Bristol, England. Forming the eastern section of the South Wales Main Line, it shortened the distance between South Wales and London for heavy mineral traffic and for express passenger trains; it relieved congestion on the line through Bath.\nIt was engineered to high standards with gentle gradients and large radius curves, and was correspondingly expensive to construct. It is about 30 miles in length.\nThe line is part of the principal route between South Wales and London, and today carries a heavy main line passenger service. All intermediate stations were closed in the 1960s, but Bristol Parkway station was opened in 1971 and remains the only passenger station on the line. Electrification of the line has been completed.\nBefore the Badminton line.\nOn 30 June 1841 the Great Western Railway company opened its first main line between London and Bristol. By this means the capital and one of the most important seaports were connected by a trunk railway line. The line was well laid out, passing through Reading and Bath. Its engineer was Isambard Kingdom Brunel.\nAt the early date when the design of the line was being finalised, Brunel was not confident of the ability of the steam engines of the day to ascend significant gradients pulling a load, and the solution appeared to be to concentrate the stiffest climb in a limited distance, and to make the remainder of the route as near to constantly level as possible. The short, steep sections could, he believed, be worked with stationary steam engines hauling the trains up by rope. Accordingly, Brunel designed the main line with two such inclines, in Box Tunnel and at Wootton Bassett. In fact by the time the railway was being built, the capacity and reliability of steam engines had advanced considerably, and the stationary steam engines were never installed, but the legacy of the two steep inclines remained.\nEven as the Great Western Railway main line was being built, the momentum of building railway lines in connection with it was building up. The Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway was promoted to build a line from Swindon to Gloucester and Cheltenham, and the South Wales Railway was formed to build on from near Gloucester to Milford Haven. This was with a view to capturing the transatlantic maritime trade as well as communication with Ireland.\nThe Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway was absorbed by the Great Western Railway before the line was opened, and the South Wales Railway amalgamated with the GWR in 1863. The network was built on the broad gauge, and this led to difficulty in competing for coal traffic from South Wales to London and the South Coast of England, as most of the coal was extracted in the South Wales Valleys, which were generally connected by narrow (standard) gauge railways. The physical transshipment of the mineral was laborious and expensive, and many producers preferred to use coastal shipping instead.\nWhen the Taff Vale Extension line of the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway was fully operational, and then taken over by the GWR, coal could be transferred on narrow (standard) gauge track to London and Southampton via Hereford.\nAs the South Wales coal business increased exponentially, there was thus a residual hostility to the Great Western Railway, and this continued after conversion of the track gauge in 1873, when at last the GWR could freely convey coal on the most direct routes available.\nThe Severn Tunnel.\nIt was not until 1886 that the Severn Tunnel was operational, on 1 September 1886 for goods and on 1 December 1886 for passenger trains. Before that date the shortest route for minerals and passengers from South Wales was via Gloucester and Swindon. Now that the Severn Tunnel was available, that traffic could run via Bristol (or the short avoiding line known as Dr Days Curve) and Bath. This was a considerable improvement, but the route through Bath became heavily congested, now carrying much of the South Wales traffic and all of the Bristol and West of England traffic.\nLondon and South Wales Railway.\nIn South Wales, dissatisfaction with the Great Western Railway continued to be a factor. It was effectively a monopoly for the trunk haulage of coal to London and Southampton (as far as Salisbury; Southampton was an important bunkering port for the transatlantic shipping trade, and Portsmouth was a major home port for the Royal Navy.)\nThe Barry Railway Company had been exceptionally successful in South Wales in building ambitious and well-laid-out lines to its modern and well-equipped port. this emboldened those associated with it, and with coalowners who used it and were pleased with the alternatives it offered, to put together a scheme for a London and South Wales Railway. This was announced in November 1895. It was to build a new line from Cogan via Cardiff and skirting Newport on the north side, crossing the River Severn at Beachley by a new 3,300 yard bridge, then via Thornbury, Malmesbury and Lechlade, to make a junction with the Metropolitan Railway near Great Missenden. At 163 miles in length, the scheme was costed at £5,688,252. At the same time, the Vale of Glamorgan Railway promoted a Bill for a new line westward from Ewenny via Porthcawl and Port Talbot to join the Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway at Aberavon.\nFor at least a decade, the Great Western Railway had indicated that it might build a cut-off line to shorten the route from the Severn Tunnel to London, but it had not done so. Barrie says, \"Beyond all reasonable doubt, the real object of the London &amp; South Wales promoters was to force the Great Western Railway to carry out its South Wales Direct Line, and to make certain concessions to the South Wales coal trade.\"\nNow the GWR saw the real possibility of a competing line being built, and hastily put together a Parliamentary Bill for its own direct line. Both schemes were submitted for the 1886 Parliamentary session. The promoters of the London and South Wales Railway, no doubt seeing that their objective had been achieved, withdrew their Bill.\nThe GWR Bill.\nAccordingly, the Great Western Railway promoted a Bill in the 1896 session for a line from Wootton Bassett to Patchway. At 30 miles in length the line would reduce the South Wales to London journey by ten miles. It would also by-pass the Box and Wootton Bassett inclines, and relieve the heavy congestion between Bathampton and Bristol. This last was so difficult that quadrupling the line had been considered, \"an impossibly costly proceeding\" according to MacDermot.\nThe Act for the South Wales and Bristol Direct Railway was passed on 23 July 1896.\nConstruction.\nA contract for the main part of the construction was let to Pearson &amp; Son Limited on 21 October 1897, in the amount of £986,000.\nThe major work was the Sodbury tunnel, which was constructed from seven vertical shafts as access to the sites of the ends of the tunnels had not been excavated at first. The contractor used a remarkable number of steam locomotives in the work: 50 were in use at one time or another (but not simultaneously), reflecting the volume of earth that was moved. Excavated material amounted to five million cubic yards.\nOpening.\nThe first section of the line was opened to goods traffic on 1 January 1903, and from Badminton to Patchway and Filton, also for goods traffic, on 1 May 1903. On 26 June 1903 Colonel H. A. Yorke of the Board of Trade made an inspection of the line over two days; BoT approval was a requirement before the operation of passenger trains was permitted. Yorke approved the line but insisted on a general speed restriction of for three months. Use of the Westerleigh loops by passenger trains was refused for the time being as the junctions were not ready.\nThe entire route of was opened to passenger traffic on 1 July 1903. A large marshalling yard was built at Stoke Gifford, with ten sidings capable of holding 500 wagons. From Stoke Gifford a spur ran to Filton, towards Bristol. Intending that the line should be suitable for heavy mineral traffic from South Wales as well as express passenger trains, the steepest gradient was made at 1 in 300, and no curve of less radius than one mile; this was achieved by some heavy earthworks as well as four large viaducts, one near Somerford over the Avon and the Malmesbury Branch, and three near Winterbourne. The Chipping Sodbury Tunnel () was built under the ridge of the Cotswolds between Badminton and Chipping Sodbury, and the Alderton Tunnel () at Alderton east of Badminton. Stations were built at , , , , , , and , and water troughs laid near Chipping Sodbury. The stations at Little Somerford, Badminton, Chipping Sodbury and Coalpit Heath were constructed with four tracks, with platforms on the outer two, to enable through fast trains to overtake slower trains.\nThe new line shortened the distance between London and South Wales by ten miles and was considerably easier to work over, enabling an acceleration of the express trains by 25 minutes, and allowing much greater loads to be carried by the coal trains from Stoke Gifford. (The gradients in the Severn Tunnel remained the limiting factor there.)\nThe original Parliamentary Bill for the line proposed a branch to the Severn and Wye Joint Railway, which would have run more or less parallel with the Bristol and Gloucester line of the Midland Railway. The proposal was withdrawn by arrangement with the Midland Railway, and it was agreed that a short spur connection could be made at and another south of , to connect it with the joint railway, and exercise their old running powers from 1846 and 1848 over the intervening of the Midland line. The two spurs referred to opened for goods traffic on 9 March 1908.\nOn 1 July 1903, four South Wales expresses each way were altered to use the Badminton Line: the best of these reached Newport in 2 hours 33 minutes compared with 2 hours 57 minutes formerly. On 4 August 1903 a first part of the old Up Flying Dutchman from Bristol was altered to leave Temple Meads at noon and run over the Badminton line to arrive at Paddington at 2 o'clock, the speed for the being . This was the first regular two-hour train between London and Bristol.\nMineral railways at Coalpit Heath.\nFrom 1832 a horse-operated tramway, part of the Bristol and Gloucestershire Railway, was constructed to connect coal pits in the vicinity of Coalpit Heath with the River Avon near Keynsham. By the time of the construction of the Badminton line the tramway had been converted to a standard gauge railway, and the Badminton line passed over it by a bridge. A siding connection was made to Coalpit Heath station.\nLocations.\nWesterleigh loops.\nThe loops at Westerleigh, connecting the Badminton line with the Midland Railway at Yate, had been opened to goods trains concurrently with the Badminton main line itself. The GWR wished to use the loops to operate an independent service between Bristol and Gloucester, using running powers over the Midland Railway. However the Midland argued that the running powers, so far as the Westerleigh and Yate connections were concerned, only applied to traffic for the Severn and Wye line. They insisted that any Bristol to Gloucester through trains should use their Mangotsfield line from Bristol, incurring higher charges for use of the line. The issue went to arbitration and then to litigation, but the loop lines were out of use while the dispute continued. It was finally resolved in 1908 when they were reopened for goods trains, on 9 March. On 20 October they were inspected for passenger operation by Colonel Yorke and on 2 November 1908 the first use by a through passenger train took place.\nDuring World War I the east loop was closed to save staff, from 18 December 1916 to 18 February 1919. Traffic on the east curve was never heavy, and it was closed from 10 July 1927. However, during World War II there were concerns that main routes might be blocked by enemy action, and the curve was reopened as an emergency alternative route. This included the provision of a new Westerleigh East Junction signal box; the curve was available from 16 August 1942 until final closure on 4 January 1950. \nBadminton station.\nA covenant was signed between the Duke of Beaufort and the Great Western Railway undertaking that four passenger trains would make calls at Badminton station every day; in addition, any train must stop there if a first class passenger desired to alight.\nAvonmouth.\nThe Stoke Gifford direct line from Avonmouth was opened on 9 May 1910, running from Holesmouth Junction at Avonmouth to Stoke Gifford. This gave direct access for industrial mineral traffic to the West Midlands via Honeybourne.\nMalmesbury branch.\nThe Malmesbury branch had opened on 17 December 1877, running from Dauntsey station on the Great Western Railway main line. When the Badminton line was built, it crossed over the Malmesbury branch a short distance west of Little Somerford.\nIn 1932 the branch was altered to run into Little Somerford station instead of Dauntsey. The branch connection ran alongside the Badminton line for some distance to reach the station. The altered passenger service started on 17 July 1933. The original route to Dauntsey was closed, but part of it was retained as a stub for wagon storage for some years.\nBristol to Gloucester route modified.\nBy the 1960s the route for the majority of through passenger trains between Bristol and Gloucester was the former Midland Railway route through Fishponds. Very few through passenger trains used the former GWR alternative, through Filton and Westerleigh, except during busy periods at summer weekends. However it was decided to close the Fishponds line and divert all such traffic on to the Filton route, and this was done on 3 January 1970, from which date all such trains used the part of the Badminton line between Filton and Yate.\nBristol Parkway station.\nAll the South Wales to London trains and all the Bristol to Birmingham trains now passed through Stoke Gifford, and it was proposed to build a new station there. As an out-of-town location, it would be attractive to motorists in the Greater Bristol area, who might drive to the station and park, continuing by rail. Accordingly, the station was known as Bristol Parkway, opening on 1 May 1972. Parking was free for some years.\nLine closure for upgrade.\nDue to a backlog of rectification work for deteriorating track formation, the line between Wootton Bassett Junction and Westerleigh Junction was closed from 5 May to 6 October 1975, to enable extensive upgrading of the infrastructure. London to South Wales ran via Bath.\nIn addition to the track formation work, crossovers for reversible operation were installed, and special arrangements were made for the permanent way staff's refuges in Alderton and Chipping Sodbury tunnels. This included handrails \"to prevent [the track workers] being drawn out of the recess by the turbulence caused by a passing High Speed Train\". The High Speed Trains were to be introduced on the line in the following October.\nSlip coaches.\nFrom May 1923, two down Fishguard trains slipped coaches for Temple Meads at Stoke Gifford. There was no passenger station there, and the slipped vehicles were taken on to Temple Meads by a train specially run to Stoke Gifford for the purpose. The trains concerned were the 8.45 am and the 8.0 pm from Paddington to Fishguard, and the slipped portions reached Temple Meads at 11.3 am and 10.20 pm respectively.\nIn Table 10, Fryer shows one slip at Stoke Gifford in 1932 for Bristol Temple Meads; and two in 1938, one of which continued to Taunton and the other to Weston-super-Mare.\nThe Bristolian.\nTo mark the centenary of the Great Western Railway, the company inaugurated an express train named The Bristolian in 1935. The westward route from London to Bristol was conventionally via Bath, but the return journey was over the Badminton line. The timing was 105 minutes each way non-stop.\nStation closures.\nThe area served by the line was sparsely populated, and after World War II patronage of the intermediate stations fell away. On 3 April 1961 they were closed to passenger trains, with the exception of Badminton. Most of the intermediate goods services were withdrawn in the period from 1963 to 1965.\nThe closure of Badminton station was delayed by the undertaking given to the Duke of Beaufort when the line was authorised, that four trains would call daily, but closure finally took place on 3 June 1968.\nStoke Gifford yards were closed on 4 October 1971.\nTopography.\nGradients.\nFrom Wootton Bassett Junction the line fell generally at 1 in 300 to Little Somerford, then climbing at the same gradient to Badminton. After that the line fell at 1 in 300 through Sodbury Tunnel and on to Stoke Gifford."

During his rugby career, Betts, a prop, has also played for English clubs Leicester Tigers, Loughborough Students, Ealing Trailfinders, and Doncaster Knights, as well as spending time on loan in Australia with Sydney University. Internationally, Betts represented his native Ireland at under-20 level.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Limerick, Betts went to school at Tarbert Comprehensive school in County Kerry. He first began playing rugby for Estuary RFC in Shanagolden, County Limerick but, after a year with the club, he then moved to Young Munster. He represented Munster at youth, under-19 and under-20 level, whilst also representing Ireland at under-18 clubs, under-19 and under-20 level.\nCareer.\nBetts was named in the Ireland squad for the 2016 World Rugby Under 20 Championship but, despite featuring strongly in Ireland's run to the final, he was not offered a professional contract by the IRFU or Munster. Instead, Betts moved across the Irish sea to Leicester Tigers.\nBetts made his Leicester debut on 28 January 2017, coming off the bench in the 2016–17 Anglo-Welsh Cup against Northampton Saints at Welford Road. He spent the season on a dual-registration deal with Loughborough Students in National League 1, before spending a summer loan spell with Sydney University in Australia.\nIn April 2018, Ealing Trailfinders, who compete in the RFU Championship, announced that Betts would be joining them from the 2018–19 season. Betts joined another English side, Nottingham, on loan for the 2019–20 season, before leaving Ealing on a permanent basis to join fellow Championship side Doncaster Knights ahead of the 2020–21 season. However, Betts was released from his contract by Doncaster in July 2020 after he decided to retire from playing rugby to focus on interests outside of rugby. Despite this Betts re-joined Nottingham in March 2021 as the club assembled a squad for the COVID-19-delayed 2020–21 RFU Championship."

The first One Day International (ODI) on the ground took place in 1972, again between England and Australia, and the first Twenty20 International (T20I) on the ground was played between England and the Netherlands in 2009. In women's cricket, Lord's has hosted Women's One Day Internationals – the first of which was played between England and Australia in 1976 – and one Women's Twenty20 International, played between England and New Zealand in 2009.\nIn cricket, a five-wicket haul (also known as a \"five-for\" or \"fifer\") refers to a bowler taking five or more wickets in a single innings. This is regarded as a notable achievement, and those players who take a five-wicket haul in a Test at Lord's earn a place on the Lord's honours boards. \nThe first bowler to take a five-wicket haul in a Test match at Lord's was England's Ted Peate in 1884 who finished with bowling figures of 6 wickets for 85 runs (6/85), bowling in the first innings of the first Test match played on the ground. Australia's Joey Palmer and England's George Ulyett both took five-wicket hauls during the same match, Ulyett taking seven wickets in Australia's second innings. The first bowler to take five wickets in an ODI on the ground was Australia's Gary Gilmour took 5 wickets for 48 runs against the West Indies in the 1975 Cricket World Cup Final. No five-wicket hauls have been taken in T20I cricket on the ground.\nIn women's cricket the first bowler to take a five-wicket haul on the ground in an international match was Cathryn Fitzpatrick who took 5 wickets for 47 runs against England in 1998.\nTest match five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 190 five-wicket hauls have been taken in Test matches at Lord's.\nOne Day International five-wicket hauls.\nA total of 18 five-wicket hauls have been taken in ODIs at Lord's."

The events took place at the Puerto Madero in Buenos Aires, Argentina, being raced over a 500 metre 4 lane course, under the Puente de la Mujer. Racing started with a time trial (out, round a buoy, and back) to allocate crews to heats. There were two rounds of heats with crews being awarded points based on their ranking in each heat and the accumulated points from the two heats determining progression to the quarter-finals of the singles and semi-finals of the pairs.\nQualification.\nSix qualification events were held to determine the representation for the 2018 Youth Olympics, the 2017 World Junior Championships and five continental qualifiers. Each National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter a maximum of 2 boats, 1 per each gender. Should Argentina not qualify any boats they would be given a boat in single sculls for each gender. As Argentina qualified two boats the host quota was reallocated to the American Qualification Regatta. In addition four athlete quotas, two from each gender will be decided by the Tripartite Commission.\nTo be eligible to participate at the Youth Olympics athletes must have been born between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2001. Should a NOC qualify two boats from the same gender the boat with the higher ranking will be qualified and the next highest ranked NOC will qualify."

        "text": "Billy Dewon Preston Jr. (born October 26, 1997) is an American professional basketball player. A power forward, he attended four high schools: St. John Bosco High School, Redondo Union High School, Prime Prep Academy, and Oak Hill Academy. He was ranked among the top recruits of his class, earning McDonald's All-American honors while at Oak Hill.\nFollowing high school, Preston enrolled at the University of Kansas and had signed to play basketball for the Jayhawks. In November 2017, he was involved in an on-campus car accident that resulted in no injuries. Preston, without having played any games, was sidelined until the completion of a university investigation into the incident. After being barred for over two months, he opted to play at the professional level instead.\nHigh school career.\nA Santa Ana, California native, Preston attended St. John Bosco High School in Bellflower, California and Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, followed by a stint at Prime Prep in Dallas, Texas. In 2016, he transferred to Oak Hill Academy. He had per-game averages of 15.3 points and 9.2 rebounds as a senior at Oak Hill.\nIn November 2016, he committed to Kansas, after he had also visited Syracuse, Indiana and the University of Southern California during the recruiting process.\nPreston played in the 2017 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, scoring ten points and grabbing three rebounds. In the 2017 Jordan Brand Classic, he tallied seven points in 15 minutes of play.\nCollege career.\nPreston was held out of the Kansas Jayhawks lineup indefinitely due to a car accident on KU campus on November 8, 2017. The accident, which resulted in no personal injuries, triggered an NCAA investigation into the \"financial picture\" of the vehicle. On January 20, 2018, Preston left Kansas in the middle of the 2017–18 season due to frustration over the investigation. Although he played in Jayhawks exhibition games before the accident, he played no regular-season games for the team.\nProfessional career.\nKK Igokea (2018).\nOn January 20, 2018, Preston signed with Igokea Laktaši of the ABA League and Bosnian League. He made his professional debut 9 days later, recording 2 points, 2 assists, 1 rebound, and 1 steal in 6 minutes of play in a win against Zadar. On March 4, 2018, after playing in only three ABA League games with Igokea, Preston left Igokea due to a sore shoulder which persistently hurt him during his last two weeks with the team. His name would officially pop up as one of a record-high 236 underclassmen to declare entry for the 2018 NBA draft on April 24, 2018. Ten days later, Preston was announced as one of a record-high 69 invites for the NBA Draft Combine that year.\nCanton Charge (2018).\nUltimately, Preston went undrafted that year. However, he signed with the Cleveland Cavaliers on June 23, 2018, as a member of their 2018 NBA Summer League team. On July 7, Preston signed a two-way contract with the Cavaliers, meaning he would split his playing time between them and their NBA G League affiliate, the Canton Charge, for the 2018–19 season, with the contract also going into the 2019–2020 season. On December 2, 2018, Preston was waived without appearing in a game for the Cavaliers.\nErie BayHawks (2018–2019).\nOn December 16, 2018, the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G League announced that they had acquired Preston from Canton Charge for the returning right of Jordan Mathews. On February 8, 2019, Preston was traded to the Texas Legends.\nTexas Legends (2019).\nOn February 8, 2019, Preston was traded to the Texas Legends for the returning rights of Codi Miller-McIntyre. After just over a month into the 2019–20 NBA G League season, Preston left for the National Basketball League of Australia.\nIllawarra Hawks (2019).\nOn December 9, 2019, Preston signed with the Illawarra Hawks of the Australian National Basketball League (NBL). He was released after only three games.\nDominican Republic (2019).\nIn 2019, Preston played for Metropolitanos de Mauricio Baez of the Dominican Torneo de Baloncesto Superior (TBS).\nCape Town Tigers (2021–2022).\nIn September 2021, Preston signed with the Cape Town Tigers of the Basketball Africa League (BAL), ahead of the qualifiers of the 2022 BAL season.

The total prize money is $50 million.\nThis is considered the first major professional boxing tournament attempt since the Super Six World Boxing Classic, which took place from 2009 to 2011.\nThe first season of tournament was held from 2017 to 2018 at two weight classes: cruiserweight and super middleweight. The inaugural tournament started in September 2017 and finished with two finals in the summer of 2018. With the tournament, the cruiserweight division crowned its first undisputed champion since 2006.\nAt a press conference in London on 9 May 2018, a second season was announced, which took place from 2018 to 2019. Bantamweight and light welterweight was confirmed as two of the three weight classes involved. The third weight class was later revealed to be cruiserweight, following the 2017-18 tournament in that division.\nThe third season was announced in June 2021, with a single tournament for women's super featherweight boxers.\nQualification.\nAll WBA, WBC, WBO, and IBF world champions were eligible to participate in the tournament, as well as all top 15 world-ranked contenders by each of the 4 sanctioning bodies. Comosa AG contracted eight available fighters per weight class, as well as a few potential back-ups.\nIn both seasons Comosa has staged a draft gala in Monte Carlo and Moscow, Russia to publicly announce all tournament participants and determine the draw. During the gala, the four top seeds select their quarter-final opponents from the four unseeded boxers in a live TV show.\nJudging.\nIn addition to the three judges customary in pro boxing, the World Boxing Super Series will be an additional fourth judge whose scorecard will be used if the main three judges deliver a draw result. The fourth judge can also come into play in the event that a tournament fight ends in a no contest or a no-decision and the three official scorecards do not determine a winner.\nIn addition, if a fight remains a draw even after adding the fourth judge's scorecard to those of the three official judges, the series will use a countback method to determine who advances in the tournament. The countback is a sudden-death method of scoring using the three official judges' scorecards to determine who advances. Beginning with the scorecards for the 12th or last round that occurred, the boxer who won that particular round on at least two of the three scorecards will advance. If the bout was scored evenly in the 12th round or the last round that occurred, the advancing boxer will then be determined by who won at least a majority of scorecards in the preceding round. If neither boxer won the penultimate round on at least a majority of the three official scorecards, each preceding round's scorecards will be examined until a round where one boxer was declared the winner of that round on a majority of the three official scorecards.\nAwards.\nThe WBC intends to award the champions its commemorative Diamond title. Additionally, the winners will receive the Muhammad Ali Trophy.\nDue to the 'bracket style' nature of the tournament, the winner of each tournament could claim all world titles in the field. Oleksandr Usyk, the winner of the 2018 cruiserweight tournament, unified the WBO, IBF, WBC and WBA cruiserweight titles and became the first cruiserweight undisputed champion in over a decade, and the first in the four-belt era.\neWBSS Legends tournaments.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the World Boxing Super Series decided to launch a special ‘eWBSS Heavyweight Legends’ tournament to provide some much-needed relief and entertainment for fight fans around the world. The fights were simulated on EA Sports 'Fight Night Champion' video game and feature 8 of the most recognisable heavyweight’s from history. The quarterfinals took place between 23 and 26 March. It was later announced Sonny Liston would replace Joe Frazier as Muhammad Ali's semifinalist opponent. The semifinals took place on 27 and 28 March. The final took place on 29 March.\nA ‘eWBSS Middleweight Legends’ tournament was announced on 29 March 2020. The quarterfinals took place between 30 March and 2 April. It was later announced Jake LaMotta would replace Marvin Hagler as Sugar Ray Robinson's semifinalist opponent. The semifinals took place on 3 and 4 April. The final took place on 5 April."

        "text": "The 2017–18 World Boxing Super Series – super middleweight division was a World Boxing Super Series professional boxing tournament taking place between September 2017 and September 2018 in several countries. The Super Series features 8 top-rated super middleweight boxers in a single-elimination tournament. Its winner will hold the WBA's world title, The Ring Magazine title, as well as the Muhammad Ali trophy. The tournament was organized by Comosa AG. A cruiserweight tournament is held concurrently, with prize money for both competitions totalling US$50 million.\nBracket.\nThe format of the tournament required 4 seeded fighters to each choose their opponent from the 4 remaining unseeded fighters in a draft. The seeded fighters were determined by the organizers. The draft took place on July 8, 2017, in a gala hosted by actress Melanie Winiger in Monte Carlo. Chris Eubank chose the opponent for the winner of the Eubank Jr. vs Abraham bout.\nQuarterfinals.\nSmith vs. Skoglund.\nThe first WBSS super middleweight match featured Callum Smith and Erik Skoglund, two young undefeated fighters, competing for a spot in the semifinals. At the official weigh-in, Smith hit the scales at 167 3⁄5 lbs, while Skoglund weighed-in around 167 3⁄5 lbs. The fight took place at Echo Arena in Liverpool and was announced by Jimmy Lennon Jr.\nSmith beat Skoglund by unanimous decision to win one of four quarter-finals in front of his home crowd in Liverpool. The officials scored the fight 116–112, 117–110 and 117–111 all in favor of Smith. Now unbeaten in 23 bouts, Smith also claimed the WBC Diamond belt and became the first semi-finalist in the super middleweight World Boxing Super Series. Early on, the fight appeared to be a mismatch with Smith outclassing his opponent. However, Skoglund got himself into the fight in the middle rounds behind his consistent jab and head movement, giving Smith a bloody nose. Smith would make his own surge late in the fight, scoring a knockdown in round 11 and earning a clear unanimous decision.\nEubank vs. Yıldırım.\nThe super middleweight tournament resumed with Chris Eubank Jr. defending his IBO title against Avni Yıldırım. The fight was scheduled for October 6, at the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle in Stuttgart. In the lead-up to the fight, Ahmet Öner, Yıldırım's manager, got into a one-sided confrontation with Eubank's camp at a press conference. Öner called Eubank arrogant, threatened to knock someone out, and yelled \"When you laugh, you son of a bitch, I fuck your wife in your bed!\" at a man off-stage. At the weigh-in, Eubank tipped the scales at 167 7⁄10 lbs, while Yıldırım weighed in at 168 lbs.\nOn fight night, Eubank blasted Yıldırım, knocking him out in round 3. Eubank dropped his opponent with an uppercut in the first round, and finished him with a flurry of punches punctuated with a left hook in round 3.\nThe undercard featured a 10-round bout between former Olympians Stefan Härtel and Viktor Polyakov, which was controversially won by Härtel by majority decision. Upon being announced, the decision was booed by the audience at the Hanns-Martin-Schleyer-Halle. A brawl broke out in the stands moments before the main event.\nGroves vs. Cox.\nGeorge Groves sought to defend his WBA (Super) title against Jamie Cox at the Wembley Arena in the super middleweight competition's third quarter-final match. Both fighters made weight the day before the fight, with Groves coming in at 167 1⁄10 lb, while Cox weighed 167 4⁄5 lb.\nAfter a tentative first round, Cox managed to corner Groves and hit him with accurate combination punching during round 2. Cox pressed Groves for the rest of the fight but Groves slowly started countering him with accurate timing. The fight ended in round 4, when Groves landed an uppercut to Cox's solar plexus which dropped the challenger. Cox was unable to recover as the referee counted him out. The win set up another domestic showdown for Groves, who is scheduled to face Eubank in the semifinals.\nThe undercard features tournament alternate Patrick Nielsen taking on local fighter John Ryder. Ryder blasted Nielsen, dropping him after two rounds. Nielsen was then hurt in round five by a right hook, which also dislodged his gumshield. Ryder then pounced on Nielsen, who wasn't defending himself and went down and out.\nBrähmer vs. Brant.\nThe final Super Series quarterfinal featured Jürgen Brähmer going against Robert Brant. Both competitors had recently fought at other weights, with Brähmer being a former light heavyweight world champion and Brant a fringe middleweight contender. Brähmer's last fight at super middleweight was a decision win over Mario Veit. At the weigh-in, Brähmer weighed 166 9⁄10 lb, while Brant tipped the scales at 166 lb even.\nBrähmer got a dominant decision win, outboxing and outworking Brant over twelve rounds. Brant was unable to cope with Brähmer's refined technique, and he eventually seemed to tire out. Brant had only fought ten rounds once before and he had never fought twelve rounds. Brähmer's promoter and tournament organizer, Kalle Sauerland, called it Brähmer's best performance of all time.\nTournament reserve Vincent Feigenbutz picked up a win on the undercard, with a round 11 TKO over Gastón Vega.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals took place on 17 and 24 February 2018.\nFinal.\nThe final was scheduled for 14 July 2018 in London, but later it was rescheduled for 28 September 2018 in Jeddah."

        "text": "The 2017–18 World Boxing Super Series – cruiserweight division was a World Boxing Super Series professional boxing tournament that took place between September 2017 and July 2018 in several countries. The Super Series featured eight top-rated cruiserweight boxers in a single-elimination tournament. Its winner will hold world titles for all four of boxing's major sanctioning bodies, The Ring Magazine title, as well as the Muhammad Ali trophy. The tournament was organized by Comosa AG. A super middleweight tournament was held concurrently, with prize money for both competitions totalling US$50 million.\nAt the start of the cruiserweight portion of the tournament, the world championship titles recognized by the four different sanctioning bodiesWBA (established 1921), WBC (est. 1963), IBF (est. 1983) and WBO (est. 1988)were held by four different boxers. All four of these boxers participated in the tournament, resulting in the eventual tournament champion, Oleksandr Usyk, becoming only the fourth boxer in history to become the undisputed champion of a weight class by holding the world titles from all four these sanctioning bodies.\nBracket.\nThe format of the tournament required four seeded fighters to each choose their opponent from the four remaining unseeded fighters in a draft. The seeded fighters were determined by the organizers. The draft took place on July 8, 2017, in a gala hosted by actress Melanie Winiger in Monte Carlo. Per IBF rules, Gassiev had to defend his title against Włodarczyk before facing anyone else. Therefore, that matchup was pre-arranged before the draft.\nQuarterfinals.\nUsyk vs. Huck.\nIn the inaugural match of the Super Series, top-seeded Oleksandr Usyk sought to defend his title against Marco Huck. At the weigh-in, Usyk hitting the scales at precisely 199 lbs, while Huck weighed-in at 198 lbs. The fight took place at Max-Schmeling-Halle and was announced by Jimmy Lennon Jr. At the final press conference, a bit of controversy occurred during the head to head photo, where Huck pushed his opponent Usyk.\nThe first Super Series quarter-final saw Usyk successfully retain his WBO title and advance to the semi-finals after the referee stepped in to stop the encounter and save Huck from further punishment. The official time of the stoppage was 2:16 in round 10. Usyk had little trouble in the fight. Huck provided heart and toughness, showing he was certainly not a pushover but Usyk's boxing skills were too much, completely outboxing Huck and continuously landing punches. The win was Usyk's third successful title defense, and sees him advance to the next stage of the Super Series.\nThe undercard was headlined by a bout between Noel Gevor and Isiah Thomas. Both fighters were coming off losses, but Gevor got the win via unanimous decision, with all three judges scoring the fight 100–89 in favor of Gevor.\nDorticos vs. Kudryashov.\nThe second Super Series cruiserweight quarterfinal featured Yuniel Dorticos defending his WBA (Regular) title against Dmitry Kudryashov. The bout generated some expectation, as Kudryashov and Dorticos were both known as knockout punchers, with 42 out of 43 of their combined previous fights ending by way of knockout. This will be the Super Series' first match in the United States. A percentage of the gate revenue will be donated to the San Antonio Food Bank to aid victims of Hurricane Harvey. At the official weigh-in, Dmitry Kudryashov initially missed weight by half a pound, coming in at 200 1⁄2 lbs. However, he was able to come in at exactly 200 lbs in a second try 45 minutes later. Dorticos weighed in at 199 lbs.\nOn fight night, Dorticos retained his title and advanced to the semi-finals by knocking out Kudryashov in just 2 rounds. The fight started with a slow-paced, feel out round, with both boxers studying their opponent. Dorticos successfully executed a pull counter as the bell sounded. In round 2, the pace of the fight increased, with Dorticos and Kudryashov trading combinations. Eventually, Dorticos gained the upper hand by landing a series of one-two combos, as Kudryashov retreated behind his high guard. Dorticos ended the contest by knocking out Kudryashov with a right hook. The referee waived the count with a minute left in round 2.\nIn the undercard, Keith Tapia won a wide unanimous decision over Lateef Kayode (100–89, 100–89, 99–90), having dropped him once at the end of round 6. Earlier, four-weight world champion Nonito Donaire defeated Rubén García Hernández by unanimous decision (100–90, 99–91, 97–93) for the WBC Silver featherweight title.\nBriedis vs. Perez.\nMairis Briedis defended his WBC cruiserweight title against Mike Perez in the third WBSS cruiserweight quarterfinal. This was Perez's second fight as a cruiserweight, after he came down from the heavyweight division following a TKO loss to Alexander Povetkin. The bout took place in Briedis' hometown of Riga, at the eponymous Arena Riga. At the official weigh-in, Briedis tipped the scales at 198 1⁄2 lbs, while Mike Perez came in lighter, at 197 1⁄3 lbs.\nBriedis won a scrappy fight in his hometown, beating Mike Perez by unanimous decision after 12 rounds (116–110, 114–112, 115–111). Perez was deducted a point in round 3 following an accidental headbutt. Briedis was also docked a point during round 10 for excessive holding. With the win, Briedis moves on to the semifinals to face top-seeded Oleksandr Usyk.\nThe undercard saw tournament reserve Krzysztof Głowacki beat Leonardo Bruzesse via 5th-round knockout and super heavyweight Olympic medalist Filip Hrgović dominate and defeat Zumbano Love via TKO in the first round in his professional debut.\nGassiev vs. Włodarczyk.\nThe final cruiserweight quarterfinal match was between IBF champion Murat Gassiev and former IBF and WBC champion Krzysztof Włodarczyk. the fight would take place in Newark, New Jersey at the Prudential Center on 21 October 2017. One of the main factors for the fight taking place in New Jersey was due to the Polish population in that state. At the official weigh-in, Gassiev tipped the scales at 199 lb, while Włodarczyk weighed 199 1⁄2 lb.\nGassiev delivered a dominant 3rd-round KO, retaining his IBF title and securing his place in the semi-finals. Gassiev was in control the opening two rounds working away on Włodarczyk. Midway through round 3, having Włodarczyk against the ropes, Gassiev connected with a left uppercut to the head, which was immediately followed by a left to the body, dropping Włodarczyk on all fours, flat on the canvas. Włodarczyk, clearly in pain, failed to beat the 10 count. The official time of stoppage was 1:57 of the round. Gassiev, who was pleased with his performance, said, \"I had a great opponent tonight. I prepared myself for a tough fight, but it is boxing, and anything can happen. We do a lot of work in the gym, and I just listened to my coach round after round, and he told me what I needed to do. That's all I needed.\" Włodarczyk accepted defeat admitting the better man won.\nOn the undercard, Maciej Sulęcki defeated Jack Culcay via unanimous decision, and tournament alternate Mateusz Masternak beat Stivens Bujaj.\nSemifinals.\nAll four pre-tournament champions emerged from the quarterfinals, retaining their respective cruiserweight world champion titles: Usyk as champion of the WBO; Briedis as champion of the WBC; Gassiev as champion of the IBF; and Dorticos as champion of the WBA. This meant that each semifinal bout would result in a champion unifying two sanctioning bodies' titles.\nUsyk vs. Briedis.\nOn 27 January 2018, Usyk defeated Briedis by a majority decision, becoming the unified WBC–WBO champion. \nGassiev vs. Dorticos.\nOn 3 February 2018, Gassiev defeated Dorticos by a technical knockout in the 12th round, becoming the unified WBA–IBF champion.\nFinal.\nInitially, the final was scheduled for 11 May 2018 in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, but later it was rescheduled for 21 July 2018 in Moscow, Russia.\nUsyk defeated Gassiev by a unanimous decision, unifying the cruiserweight titles of all four major sanctioning organizations, becoming the undisputed cruiserweight world champion."

Although the team is now a local Yorkshire team, prior to Hackenthorpe being incorporated into Sheffield in the 1930s, the village and team was located in Derbyshire county.\nHistory.\nThe Cricket club was started due to the efforts of local businessman James Hounsfield that resided at Hackenthorpe Hall. Mr Hounsfield originally gave the club a free 40-year lease on the cricket ground that today is found next to Rainbow Forge school. A pavilion was built which contained an oak chest in which bats and other equipment were stored. The players arranged a set one night per week practice. Many local families in the village were associated with the cricket club, including the Hounsfields themselves, Havenhands and Staniforths. In the early years the team relied on horse and wagon to get the players around the county for matches. Local driver John Hempsell arranged to pick up the players from either of the villages inns, the Bluebell or the Sportsman Inn.\nOne of the first recorded games took place on 12 May 1888 and involved a H.B Lund, who was schoolmaster at Hackenthorpe Infants School scoring at Shirecliffe Hall. The score for this match was Hackenthorpe 10 for 60, Shirecliffe Hall 10 for 43. The first home match recorded was played against Collegiate. This match ended with Hackenthorpe winning by 21 runs.\nThe Hackenthorpe team recorded on 12 May 1888 consisted of:\nThe Hackenthorpe Miner's Welfare was started in 1925 when funds were granted from the Miners' Welfare Central Fund. A new cricket pitch was laid in nearby Beighton in 1926 and the Miners' Welfare Cricket Club formed in 1928 when twelve pounds was offered to the Hackenthorpe Cricket Club. On 6 July 1929 the official opening of the new committee was performed. The first secretary of the Miners Welfare was Frederick Lambert Jr. who was then followed by Herbert Staniforth. In 1927 Tommy Harrison took over and would remain secretary for thirty years.\nThe team would then go on to win the Norton and District Trophy in 1938.\nWith the outbreak of World War II, the team disbanded in 1939 and then reformed in 1946.\nNotable players.\nTwo notable players that played for Hackenthorpe went on to play for Derbyshire County Cricket Club, Thomas Hounsfield and Freddie Taylor."

Eventually, the IHF paid for the entire accommodation of the teams as well as the nominees after price negotiations made by the Managing Director.\nIn the terms of transportation, the organiser did not fulfil the agreed concept of transportation for the teams, but following an intervention of the Minister of Sports Mr. Stephan Toussaint more vehicles were made available. In addition, the three venues were not constructed while the main venue was not completely done. The Chairman of the IHF Beach Handball Working Group was authorised by President Moustafa to negotiate the price of the venue construction; and eventually four venues were reduced to three and the IHF nominees were cleaning and setting up the two venues to reduce the cost. Due to the absence of the Local Organising Committee, including the President and remaining representatives of Mauritius Handball Federation, at the event, the full organisation was taken over by the IHF. \nAs for the competition, both Brazilian teams and the Togolese women’s team withdrew their participation shortly before the event. \nDue to the payments made by the IHF an amount of CHF 173,619.27 needs to be reimbursed to the IHF by Mauritius Handball Federation. The IHF Executive Committee proposed in its meeting in Tbilisi on 17 August 2017 to wait for an official communication from Mauritius Handball Federation to explain the situation occurred before submitting the issue to the IHF legal bodies for further decisions."

As they were using a cradle, the mine manager; Arthur Simpkin stated that the over-winding gear could not be used, the use of temporary safety location marks on the winding indicator was confirmed by the mining company director; Mr Hargreaves, and that despite the emergency-stop signaling by banksman; David Precious (of Snydale), momentary forgetfulness of the winding engineman; Noah Guest, who momentarily believed he was winding from much lower-level of the shaft at his usual position at Haigh Moor seam, resulted in the cradle crashing in to the headgear, the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, the coroner agreed with the jury that an act criminal negligence had not been committed by Noah Guest, who was of good character, and had never before made a mistake. Fifteen minutes after his arrival at Clayton Hospital, Wakefield, Radford, who was badly crushed, with many broken bones, was pronounced dead by the house surgeon Ida Guillaume (1876-1929). Higgins' right arm was so badly injured it had to be amputated, and he also lost two fingers from his left hand."

It was held from 1–7 October 2017 at the Citywest Hotel in Dublin, Ireland.\nMichael van Gerwen was the defending champion after defeating Gary Anderson 5–2 in the 2016 final, but lost to John Henderson 2–1 in the first round. This was the first time since December 2011 that van Gerwen lost in the first round of a major ranking tournament.\nDaryl Gurney won his first major televised title after beating Simon Whitlock 5–4 in the final. \nFor the first time in PDC history, no English player made the quarter-final stages of a televised tournament. Gurney's success also marked the first time that a televised darts tournament was won by a Northern Irish player.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money remained at £400,000. The following is the breakdown of the fund:\nQualification.\nThe field of 32 players was made up from the top 16 on the PDC Order of Merit on September 11 and the top 16 non-qualified players from the ProTour Order of Merit. In a change to qualification from recent years, the top two non-qualified residents of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland now no longer get an automatic qualification spot. The top eight players were seeded in the tournament.\nPhil Taylor (who would have been the #4 seed) opted not to enter the tournament, moving the rest of the top 16 up a place, thus meaning 17th placed Robert Thornton (the 2015 champion who would not have qualified otherwise) took his place. Number two seed Gary Anderson withdrew shortly before the tournament began due to the impending birth of his child, with Mark Webster, the highest-ranked player from the PDC Order of Merit not to have qualified, replacing him in the draw, with the seedings not being adjusted. Four players, Rob Cross, Ronny Huybrechts, Christian Kist and Richard North made their World Grand Prix debuts.\nThe following players qualified for the tournament:\nPDC Order of Merit (1–16) \"(Top 8 seeded)\"\nPro Tour"

        "text": "The 2018 Road to the Kentucky Derby was a series of races through which horses qualified for the 2018 Kentucky Derby, which was held on May 5. The field for the Derby was limited to 20 horses, with up to four 'also eligibles' in case of a late withdrawal from the field. There were three separate paths for horses to take to qualify for the Derby: the main Road consisting of 34 races in North America plus one in Dubai, the Japan Road consisting of three races in Japan, and a new European Road consisting of seven races in England, Ireland and France.\nThe races in the Road to the Kentucky Derby were held from September 2017 (when the horses were two) through April 2018 (when they had turned three). The top four finishers in the specified races earned points, with the highest point values awarded in the major preparatory races held in late March or early April. Earnings in non-restricted stakes acted as a tie breaker.\nChanges from 2017 series.\nFor 2018, several changes were made from the 2017 series:\nThe Delta Downs Jackpot Stakes, which would have been the 36th race in the main series, was cancelled in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey.\nMain Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nStandings.\nThe following table shows the points earned in the eligible races for the main series.

If the connections of that horse decline the invitation, their place is offered to the second-place finisher and so on through the top four finishers. If neither of the top four accept, this place in the starting gate reverts to the horses on the main road to the Derby. \"Eligible Earnings\", defined as career earnings through April 14, 2018, serves as the tie-break if two or more horses have the same number of points. For 2018, none of the invitations was accepted.\nQualification table.\nThe top four horses (colored brown within the standings) are eligible to participate in the Kentucky Derby provided the horse is nominated.\n^ - not nominated\n~ - declined offer to participate\nEvents.\n\"Note: Cattleya Sho and Zen-Nippon Nisai Yushun: 1st=10 points; 2nd=4 points; 3rd=2 points; 4th=1 points\"\n\"Note: Hyacinth: 1st=30 points; 2nd=12 points; 3rd=6 points; 4th=3 points\"\nEuropean Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe European Road to the Kentucky Derby is designed on a similar basis to the Japan Road and is intended to provide a place in the Derby starting gate to the top finisher in the series. If the connections of that horse decline the invitation, their place is offered to the second-place finisher and so on. If neither of the top four accept, this place in the starting gate reverts to the horses on the main road to the Derby. \"Eligible Earnings\", defined as non-restricted stakes earnings through April 14, 2018, serves as the tie-break if two or more horses have the same number of points. If non-restricted stakes earnings happen to be identical, career earnings through April 14, 2018 would be used to break the tie.\nThe series consists of seven races – four run on the turf in late 2017 when the horses are age two, plus three races run on a synthetic surface in early 2018.\nQualification table.\nThe following table shows the points earned in the eligible races for the European series. The top four horses (colored brown within the standings) were eligible for the invitation to participate in the Kentucky Derby, provided the horse was nominated. The connections of Gronkowski, who finished first with 50 points, accepted the invitation but Gronkowski subsequently became ill and had to miss the race. The second-place finisher, Mendelssohn, separately qualified on the main Road by winning the UAE Derby.\nEvents.\nPoints offered:"

        "text": "Charlotte Lewis (September 10, 1955 – September 17, 2007) was an American basketball player who competed on the 1976 United States Olympic team.\nHigh school.\nLewis attended Woodruff High School in 1974 but did not play basketball because the Peoria public schools did not yet offer a varsity basketball for females. Despite this lack of opportunity within the school, she played basketball on the playgrounds of Peoria, usually playing with boys. However, her ability came to the attention of Jill Hutchinson, who was working on building a program at Illinois State University. Lewis was invited to enroll at ISU to further her basketball career.\nCollege.\nWhile at ISU, Lewis help the Redbirds win four state championships. She set the record for most rebounds in a game (27) and in a season (345); records which are still school records as of 2017. Lewis earned a letter in each of her four years at Illinois state. In the 1976–77 season the team recorded a record of 20–6 which led to a national ranking, 11th in the AIAW. She was named a Kodak All-American in 1977 and listed as a finalist for the Wade Trophy (an award for the nation's top female athlete). Lewis's accomplishments led to her induction into the Missouri Valley Conference Hall of Fame in 2016.\nUSA Basketball.\nPan Am.\nLewis was named to the USA Basketball team roster. She would play for the team in the 1975 USA Women's Pan American Team. The games were originally planned for Santiago, Chile, then Sao Paulo, Brazil and finally held in Mexico City, Mexico in October. The Pan Am team had failed to win the gold in 1967 and 1971. This year, the team would be more successful, compiling a 7–0 record, and winning the gold medal for the first time since 1963.\nOlympics.\nLewis was named to the USA national team selected to play in the 1976 Olympics the first ever Olympic competition for a women's basketball team. While the team lost to the dominant Soviet Union team, they beat Czechoslovakia to win the silver medal.\nProfessional career.\nLewis left school before graduating, and turned professional. She joined a professional team in France and played there for two years, before returning to the states and playing for the Iowa Cornets, a team in the Women's Professional Basketball League, the first professional basketball league for women in the US. While the story is certainly exaggerated, while playing for the Iowa team a Chicago sportswriter marveled at her strength, claiming that \"when she spiked the ball in response to an officiating call, it took six seconds to return to the floor\". The coach of the Cornets, Steve Kirk, ran a practice drill he called \"War\" which had exactly one rule— \"anything goes\". Lewis noted \"he expected you to be able to make baskets when you are following and when you are filed. He expected you to be in that defensive position, to not let them go even when you are getting hit\". After her pro career, she return to ISU and completed her degree."

        "text": "The 1940–41 Challenge Cup was the 40th staging of rugby league's oldest knockout competition, the Challenge Cup. The competition was re-introduced after a season’s absence. The competition was won by Leeds who beat Halifax 19–2 in the final on 17 May 1941.\nAt the August 1940 rugby league council meeting it was proposed the complete the league season, play the county cup competitions and then finish the season with the Challenge Cup. A decision on the structure of the Challenge Cup was deferred at the December meeting of the council but in January the dates for the competition were finalised. The competition was to be played on consecutive weekends commencing 12 April 1941, there would be three rounds then the four teams in the semi-finals would play on a home and away two-legged basis on the first two weekends in May 1941 with the final on a neutral venue on 17 May. Players were not allowed to play for more than one club in the competition and there were to be no replays. Extra time of 20 minutes was to be played and in the event of the scores still being level then the game would continue until one team scored. Medals would not be presented to the players in the final, instead war savings certificates were to be awarded, four to each player on the winning team and three to each player on the losing team.\nInvitations to all 27 member clubs, even those who had not played in the league this season, were distributed in February 1941 and by the date of the draw 21 clubs had entered. Hull Kingston Rovers, Widnes, Barrow and Rochdale Hornets who had not participated in the league at all in 1940–41 declined to enter; Salford and Warrington who had played some or all of the league games but had both suspended operations in January 1941 also declined to take part in the Cup. So that clubs could make the necessary travel arrangements the first three rounds were all drawn on 26 March 1941; the first round consisting of five ties involving 10 clubs. The remaining 11 clubs were given a bye into the second round of eight matches.\nFirst round.\nThe five first-round ties were all played on Saturday 12 April 1941. The extra-time rules imposed for the competition had an immediate use as the game between Featherstone Rovers and Castleford took until the 118th minute of play to conclude. After 80 minutes the score was 3–3 and during extra-time both teams scored a goal to finish 5–5 after 100 minutes of play. A further 18 minutes had been played before Castleford's Jim Croston scored the decisive try that gave Castleford an 8–5 victory.\nSecond round.\nThe eight second round ties were played on Saturday 19 April.\nThird round.\nThe third round ties were played on 26 April 1941\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played at the beginning of May on Saturday 3 and Saturday 10 May 1941. Halifax beat Wakefield Trinity 16–12 on aggregate and Leeds beat Bradford 22–12 on aggregate.\nFinal.\nThe final was played at Bradford's Odsal Stadium on Saturday 17 May 1941. Both teams featured a number of guest players\nA crowd of 28,500 saw Leeds take a half-time lead 5–2 through a Jenkins try and an Eaton goal with Meek kicking a goal for Halifax. In the second half Leeds scored a further four tries with Lawrenson and Hey scoring two each to which Eaton added another goal. Halifax's cause wasn't helped by the loss of Beverley through injury part way through the half; with no substitutions allowed it meant Halifax had to play the last 15 minutes with only 12 players."

The draw was made on 17 January 1949. The tie between Vine Tavern and York was drawn to have the leg at York played first but the clubs agreed to reverse the tie to enable Vine Tavern to play their home leg Knowsley Road, home of nearby St. Helens. Featherstone's tie with Swinton should have had the first leg played at Featherstone. However Featherstone invoked their right under the competition rules as the first drawn club to decide where the first leg would be played and insisted that it was played at Swinton to avoid clashes with the home ties of neighbouring clubs, Normanton and Castleford, this was despite Swinton's opposition to the switch.\nThe first leg ties were played on Saturday 12 February.\nThe second leg ties were played on Saturday 19 February.\nThe tie between Leigh and Wigan ended in controversy. In January the cup committee recommended that ties ending with the scores level should play 20 minutes of extra time (10 minutes each way) with a replay only being required if the scores remained tied after this period. This recommendation as accepted by the Rugby League Council but was not, officially, made known to referees. Therefore, at the end of the second leg the referee in the Leigh v Wigan tie, Alfred Hill, ended the game after 80 minutes and did not play any extra time. The second leg was declared null and void by the Rugby League Council and a replay ordered for the following Saturday at a neutral venue, Swinton's Station Road with only the score from the first leg being taken forward into the replay.\nThe replay, refereed by W. Hemmings, was won 10–4 by Wigan who therefore went forward to the second round 21–16 on aggregate.\nSecond round.\nThe second round draw was made on 21 February 1949 with ties to be played on Saturday 5 March. On the day the game between Wigan and Wakefield was postponed due to snowfall and was played the following Wednesday, 9 March, instead.\nThird round.\nThe draw for the third round was made on 7 March with ties to be played on Saturday 19 March.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-final draw was made on 21 March with neutral venues being announced immediately after the completion of the draw, the ties were played on 2 April.\nFinal.\nThe Challenge Cup tournament's final was to be played by Bradford and Halifax at Wembley Stadium. Bradford won the game 12–0 in the final played in front of a world record rugby league crowd of 95,000. Trevor Foster and Eric Batten scored the tries for Bradford and Ernest Ward kicked three goals as well as winning the Lance Todd Trophy for man-of-the-match.\nThis was Bradford's fourth Cup Final win in seven final appearances including one win and one loss during World War II."

        "text": "Lee Jung-hyun (born March 3, 1987) is a South Korean professional basketball player for Jeonju KCC Egis in the Korean Basketball League and the South Korean national team.\nEarly life.\nLee played baseball and football throughout elementary school. A promising football prospect, he had considered becoming a professional football player. He started playing basketball in sixth grade when his elementary school decided to start a basketball team and a classmate recruited him to join the team since he already had an athletic background. As a student at Gwangju High School he gained the attention of college recruiters for his shooting skills.\nCareer.\nCollege.\nLee played college basketball for Yonsei University. He was largely unnoticed during his freshman year due to the presence of Kim Tae-sul and Yang Hee-jong, both in their senior season. During his senior year he was Yonsei's leader in points, assists and rebounds and led the team to the final of the National Basketball Festival (the main collegiate competition at that time) for the first time in five years.\nProfessional.\nAnyang KT&amp;G / Anyang KGC (2010–2017).\nIn the 2010 KBL rookie draft, Lee was drafted by Busan KT Sonicboom second overall and then traded to Anyang KT&amp;G in a player exchange. Although he scored 19 points and impressed in his debut, he spent his first two seasons as the sixth man and went on to the win the Sixth Man Award at the 2011-12 KBL awards ceremony. He enlisted for mandatory military service in April 2013 and joined the after completing basic training. He was discharged in January 2015, returning to the team roster immediately.\nDuring the 2015-16 season Lee was a mainstay of the Anyang team which reached the semi-finals of the play-offs, especially in clutch situations. He was the only Anyang player voted into the KBL Best 5 that season.\nLee was part of the Anyang team which won a rare \"double\" during the 2016-17 season, winning both the regular season as well as the KBL Championship. The top-scoring domestic player that season, he was nominated for the KBL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) award but lost to teammate Oh Se-keun. Despite his stellar record, Lee instead became better known for an incident during the playoffs, when Anyang KGC met Seoul Samsung Thunders in the finals. During Game 2, he elbowed Thunders shooting guard Lee Gwan-hee, his former Yonsei teammate, in the neck while defending him and latter forcefully pushed him down on the ground as retaliation. Both were disciplined and fined for unsporting behavior, with Lee Jung-hyun whistled for a foul and Lee Gwan-hee being ejected for an unsportsmanlike foul and suspended for the next game. As a result, he was booed by irate Thunders fans throughout Game 3 and failed to replicate his form, only scoring 9 points.\nJeonju KCC Egis (2017–2022).\nAfter his contract with Anyang KGC ended, Lee became a free agent and joined Jeonju KCC Egis for the 2017-18 season. In December 2017, he reached a milestone of appearing in his 300th consecutive KBL-sanctioned \"A\" match (professional match). He was voted KBL Most Valuable Player of the 2018-19 season as he led the league in points scored, averaging 17.2 points, among domestic players. His win made him the first Jeonju KCC Egis player in 20 years to win MVP and only the second MVP winner not from a Championship-winning team or league top-three team since the KBL was established. In December 2019, he was nominated for and won the Male Basketball Player of the Year, voted for by league coaches and his KBL peers, at the annual \"Dong-a\" Sports Awards honoring domestic professional athletes across all disciplines.\nLee was a key player in KCC winning the 2020-21 regular season and reaching the finals of the play-offs, losing the KBL Championship title to his former team Anyang KGC. However, he also became a controversial figure when the KBL released a list of players who were caught \"flopping\" (faking fouls) that season and his name was at the top of the list.\nLee's appearance record has extended into the 2021-22 season. in December, he reached the record of playing in 500 consecutive KBL-sanctioned \"A\" games.\nNational team.\nLee participated in the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup. However, his form during the group stage was inconsistent. In South Korea's opening Group C game against hosts Lebanon, Lee failed to score all five attempted three-pointers and his and shooting guard Heo Ung's lackluster performance around the perimeter were specifically pointed out as a major cause for South Korea's shock loss to the host nation. He bounced back to score 19 points in the next game, a win against Kazakhstan. For the next few games, his assist tally increased as he was switched into a combo guard role rather than a forward-shooting guard swingman.\nLee was in the final 12-man squad and named captain for the 2019 FIBA World Cup. In their opening Group B game against fifth-ranked Argentina, he scored 15 points, the only South Korean player other than Ra Gun-ah to score in the double digits. He was injured in the game against China and was forced to sit out of their last game of the tournament, against the Ivory Coast.\nControversy.\nLee's otherwise stellar 2016–17 season was marred by his infamous confrontation with Lee Gwan-hee during the playoffs. It has been speculated that both players, who are not usually known for such physical confrontations on the court, had already been on bad terms since their university days but both players and other fellow Yonsei alumni have declined to further elaborate on the matter. Ever since the incident, any games in which the two players meet has received more attention from the media and fans. Their alleged \"feud\" has been indirectly referenced numerous times during \"draft day\" for the annual All-Star Game, with fellow players and coaches noting that they should not be placed in the same team.\nAfter departing Anyang KGC, Lee gained the moniker \"eu-ak-sae\" (), which is the Korean equivalent of the onomatopoeia \"Whoops!\", from the media and fans due to his \"flopping\" (faking fouls). In the 2020–21 season alone, he tallied eleven fake fouls, the most of any domestic player and nearly twice as many as the second-placed Lee Dae-sung.\nPersonal life.\nLee is a fan of his hometown baseball team Kia Tigers and has been spotted attending their games during his off-season.\nSince 2019, Lee has been occasionally referred to as \"big Lee Jung-hyun\" () by other players and in the media due to another younger player having the exact same name being called up to the senior national team for the same game. \"Small Lee Jung-hyun\" () is also an alumnus of Yonsei University and was drafted by Goyang Orion Orions in the 2021 rookie draft. Although their names are spelled the same in Hangul, their given names are written differently in Hanja."

        "text": "Yang Hong-seok (born July 2, 1997) is a South Korean basketball player. He plays for Korean Basketball League team Changwon LG Sakers and the South Korean national team.\nEarly life.\nBorn and raised in Jeonju, Yang moved to Busan as a middle school student. He caught the attention of college recruiters after leading his high school basketball team to stellar results in various high school tournaments. As he was much taller than his peers, he played as a center and only converted into a forward in college.\nCollege career.\nYang chose Chung-Ang University over traditional powerhouses Yonsei University and Korea University. The unfancied Chung-Ang team managed to finish runners-up in the U-League table and were knocked out of the play-offs in the semi-final stage. Despite being passed over for the College Rookie of the Year Award, Yang drew attention as the only freshman to average 20 or more points. He averaged 26.7 points, 2.4 assists and 2.9 steals.\nHis performances did not go unnoticed by national team selectors and he was called up to the senior national team for the 2017 William Jones Cup and FIBA Asia Cup. He chose to declare eligibility early, joining the 2017 KBL rookie draft.\nProfessional career.\nYang was considered a strong contender for the first pick along with Yonsei point guard Heo Hoon and was the second overall pick, behind Heo. He was almost drafted by Changwon LG Sakers, but they had traded their pick and another player to Busan KT Sonicboom in exchange for Cho Sung-min in an agreement before the 2017–18 season. As one of the youngest and least experienced players in the squad, he was often used as a substitute player to gain experience rather than sent out to the D-League reserve team. He recorded his first double-double in March, against Anyang KGC and finished the season with an average of 7.57 points. Although considered one of the top prospects of his draft class, his rookie season was overshadowed by his team's lackluster performances in the regular season.\nYang began to establish himself as a starter during the 2018-19 season, often contributing points in the double digits together with Heo. In January, he achieved two records. During the January 9 game against Incheon Electro Land Elephants, he scored 27 points, his personal best, in a 88-73 loss. Weeks later against Seoul Samsung Thunders, he became the youngest player in KBL history to record a triple-double at age 21 years and 6 months, breaking Joo Hee-jung's record (age 23 years). He ended the season with nine double-doubles, his personal best and won the Most Improved Player Award and named in the KBL Best 5 of the season. He became the youngest player to rank first in the KBL All-Star Game fan vote.\nThe 2019-20 season was a mixed bag for Yang. While he continued a fruitful scoring partnership with Heo, he came under criticism for neglecting his defensive duties and for his inconsistent form.\nDuring the 2020-21 season, Yang led the league in rebounds among domestic players and also achieved ten double-doubles in the points and rebounds categories (domestic players), becoming the first player since the 2017-18 season and the first forward (KBL registered position) since Lee Seung-jun in 2012-13 to do so in those statistical categories. He achieved the milestone during the semi-finals of the play-offs against Anyang KGC and infamously continued to play even after his injured ear had to be bandaged following a collision with Anyang KGC's Moon Seong-gon. Anyang KGC went on to win the semi-final round to advance to the championship finals but Moon and Anyang manager Kim Seung-gi both publicly singled out Yang for praise. At the end of the season, he was named into the Best 5 for the season during the KBL's annual awards ceremony and also voted into the Best 5 and voted the Best Young Player by his KBL peers in \"Rookie the Basket\" magazine's annual Players' Choice Awards.\nYang recovered from a pre-season injury in time for the 2021-22 season. In January, during the loss against Daegu KOGAS Pegasus, he achieved his second triple-double (scoring 28 or more points), becoming only the third domestic player in KBL history to do so after Hur Jae and Hyun Joo-yup.\nNational team career.\nDespite only playing a year of college basketball, Yang was selected for the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup. He was mostly a substitute player, averaging around 5 minutes per game, but managed to score against Kazakhstan and the Philippines.\nYang was called up to the national team for the 2018 Asian Games and sent to the 3-on-3 team. They reached the finals but narrowly lost to China in overtime.\nYang participated in the 2019 William Jones Cup and in several qualifiers for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He was ultimately cut from the final 12-man squad for the World Cup as coach Kim Sang-shik opted for a more experienced line-up.\nPersonal life.\nYang has a brother Yang Sung-hoon, who is a year younger. The brothers had declared for the 2017 draft together but Yang Sung-hoon went undrafted and ultimately continued with his university education.\nOn March 28, 2024, basketball officials announced that Yang would enter mandatory military service on May 20, 2024, and was assigned to the Korea Armed Forces Athletic Corps , and would be discharged on November 19, 2025, and will be able to return at the beginning of the 2025–2026 season."

In its first years, the team played with several youth teams in domestic competitions.\nIn the 2017 offseason the professional club BSW from Weert and BAL intended a merger, which would integrate BSW into BAL. Following BSW going defunct during this offseason, BAL decided to take its place in the DBL. As BAL played in the same home arena and the team consisted of several of the same players, the team can be considered a phoenix club. Radenko Varagić coached the team.\nFirst DBL seasons.\nIn its debut season, BAL finished in the ninth and last place in the DBL, winning 4 out of its 32 games. The team consisted of a selection of young promising players, such as guard Sam van Dijk who was named the DBL Most Improved Player in the club's debut season. On 1 August 2018, BAL signed its first ever foreign player when American center Tony Washington signed for one year. In its second season, BAL once again finished last in the DBL with this time five wins in 2018–19.\nIn the 2020–21 season, BAL reached the playoffs for the first time after finishing in the eight seed. This season the team also won the 2021 DBL Cup, the club's first-ever trophy. In the semi-finals, BAL upset first-seeded ZZ Leiden and in the final the team was too strong for Yoast United. Trevor Jasinsky led the team in scoring in the final with 27 points.\nSince the 2021–22 season, BAL plays in the BNXT League, in which the national leagues of Belgium and the Netherlands have been merged.\nHonours.\nDBL Cup\nDutch Supercup\nPlayers.\nTop scorers by seasons.\nThe following players led BAL in scoring in each DBL season:\nClub records.\nBold denotes still active with team.

Frank Dancevic describes the conditions as \"inhumane\".\nDay 3 (January 15).\nPatrick Rafter played his first match in more than ten years when he partnered with Lleyton Hewitt in the opening round of doubles competition. The duo lost to Eric Butorac and Raven Klaasen 6–4, 7–5.\nDay 5 (January 17).\nBy winning her third round encounter against Daniela Hantuchová, Serena Williams broke Margaret Court's record of 60 match victories at the Australian Open. Chinese Li Na saved 1 match point at 1–6, 5–6, 30-40 during the match against Lucie Šafářová. \nDay 7 (January 19).\nFormer world number one and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic caused the biggest upset of the tournament thus far, coming from a set down to defeat world number one, five-time Australian Open champion and 17-time Grand Slam champion Serena Williams for the first time in five attempts. Her victory not only ended Williams' 25-match winning streak, which had dated back to Cincinnati last year, but also earned worldwide recognition and was one of the most discussed matches on social media, beating the record previously set during the 2012 Australian Open men's final. It was later revealed that Williams had played through the match with a back injury, which affected her performance in this match.\nElsewhere, 6-time Australian Open champions, the Bryan Brothers made their earliest exit at the Australian Open in 11 years after they were defeated by the unseeded duo of Eric Butorac and Raven Klaasen. The match lasted only 78 minutes, as Butorac and Klaasen won 7–6 (9), 6–4. Eugenie Bouchard became the first Canadian woman to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since Patricia Hy-Boulais did so at the 1992 US Open.\nDay 8 (January 20).\nNew ground was broken on Day 8 as Simona Halep reached the quarterfinals of Grand Slam for the first time in her career by defeating Jelena Janković in three sets, while Grigor Dimitrov became the first Bulgarian man to reach the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam tournament.\nDay 9 (January 21).\nEugenie Bouchard defeated Ana Ivanovic to become only the second Canadian to ever reach the semifinals of a Grand Slam in the open era, after Carling Bassett.\nAnother Serbian, Novak Djokovic, lost a five-set thriller to Stanislas Wawrinka, ending his 25 match winning streak at the event and 28 match winning streak overall. The defeat also ensured that there would be a new Australian Open finalist in the bottom half, as neither player from the opposing quarter-final (David Ferrer and Tomáš Berdych) had reached the final before. Berdych beat Ferrer in four sets to reach his first Australian Open semi-final and became the latest player to have reached at least the semi-finals of all four majors.\nDay 10 (January 22).\nRoger Federer became the first man to reach 11 consecutive semifinals at the Australian Open following his four-set victory over Andy Murray in the quarterfinals. Victoria Azarenka lost to Agnieszka Radwańska, ending a seven match winning streak over Radwańska and an eighteen match winning streak at the event. By defeating Azarenka, Radwańska advanced to her third major semifinal, the first since the 2013 Wimbledon Championships.\nDay 11 (January 23).\nLi Na reached her third Australian Open final in four years by beating Eugenie Bouchard. Dominika Cibulková became the first Slovak to reach the Australian Open final following her win over Agnieszka Radwańska. Stanislas Wawrinka reached his first major final by beating Tomáš Berdych in four sets.\nDay 12 (January 24).\nRafael Nadal beat Roger Federer in straight sets to reach his third Australian Open final and 19th Grand Slam final overall.\nDay 13 (January 25).\nLi Na won her first Australian Open title against first-time major finalist Dominika Cibulková. Li broke serve in the first game of the match but was broken back at 3–2, only to break again at 5–5 and serve for the set. Cibulková saved set point and took it into a tiebreak, which Li won and completed the second set 6–0 for the victory. For Li, it was her second Grand Slam title.\nDay 14 (January 26).\nStanislas Wawrinka won the first two sets against Rafael Nadal in the final. In winning the first set, Wawrinka was down 0–40 while serving for it at 5–3, but Nadal was unable to return any of Wawrinka's next five serves, which proved to be Wawrinka's 34th consecutive successful hold of serve. In the second set, Wawrinka broke in the opening game and held his own serve to lead 2–0, before Nadal sustained a back injury and needed a medical timeout. Wawrinka comfortably won the set as commentators speculated that Nadal may have been considering forfeiting the match and was seen to be in tears during changeovers. Nadal continued and won the third set, despite facing 15–40 in the first game on his own serve and also facing 15–40 while serving for the set at 5–3, as Wawrinka appeared to be suffering from nerves. Wawrinka won the match in the fourth set by winning the last eight points without reply. Pete Sampras awarded Wawrinka the trophy. This was the first time since Sergi Bruguera's 1993 French Open win that the winner of a Grand Slam men's event beat both number one and two seeds to clinch the championship; Wawrinka also became the first player to beat both Djokovic and Nadal in the same grand slam.\nFor Wawrinka, it was his first career Grand Slam title. In twelve previous match versus Nadal, he had not won a single set. Wawrinka became the third Swiss player to win a Grand Slam after Martina Hingis (who won five singles titles) and Roger Federer (who has won 17 to date). It was also the first time Nadal had lost a major final to anyone other than Federer or Novak Djokovic."

        "title": "Cumbria Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Cumbria Rugby Union is the governing body for the sport of rugby union in the county of Cumbria in England. The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Cumbria, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Cumbria rugby representative teams.\nHistory.\nThe county that we know of today as Cumbria was originally made up of two separate counties known as Cumberland and Westmorland as well as part of Lancashire called Furness. The game of rugby union was first recorded as being played in Carlisle, Cumberland, in 1870, while Westmorland followed a year later in 1871 with a game in Kendal, and club sides sprung up in the region from this point on. Cumberland were first of the two to form a (unofficial) county representative team and, with assistance from Lancashire, they played annual matches against a combined Durham and Northumberland side during the 1870s. Although the actual date that a rugby union in either Cumberland or Westmorland was formed is vague, a centenary brochure was produced by these unions during the 1972/73 season, hinting to formation around 1872/73.\nAn official Cumberland county side was formed in 1882, facing Northumberland on 11 November that same year, in what was the counties first official game. On the heels of this match the Cumberland clubs bought a Challenge Cup trophy, paid from the gate money, heralding the dawn of what would later become the Cumbria Cup, which still runs today. Four years later in 1886, Westmorland would also form their own county side, and in 1890 both counties would take part in the inaugural County Championships, competing in the north-west group where they would face each other along with Cheshire and Lancashire. Cumberland had some early success in the competition, winning their regional group on several occasions and reaching the final in 1897 when they lost 3-9 to Kent, in a game held at Carlisle. By contrast Westmorland found the County Championship much more challenging and by the 1896-97 they had decided to withdraw from the competition as they were unable to raise a side.\nWestmorland would remain apart from the County Championship until the 1906-07 season, when they merged with their neighbours to form Cumberland &amp; Westmorland, taking part in the northern group. Over the next couple of decades, Cumberland &amp; Westmorland would reach several finals, losing in 1913 before going on to win the County Championship for the first time in 1924 when they beat Kent 14-3 in Carisle. In 1974 the counties known as Cumberland and Westmorland would cease to exist as they were merged along with Furness to form Cumbria - a consequence of the Local Government Act 1972. In 1997, after a gap of over 70 years since Cumberland &amp; Westmorland last won the competition, the new look Cumbria won the County Championship, beating Somerset 21-13 at Twickenham Stadium.\nSince the County Championships was reorganized into divisions, Cumbria have failed to re-experience the success of 1997. They have reached the County Championship Shield (third tier) final at Twickenham on two occasions, losing to Surrey in 2013 and Leicestershire in 2015. The 2017 season saw Cumbria moved up into the second division based on past performances as part of the RFU reshuffle of the County Championships.\nCumbria senior men's county side.\nThe senior men's side currently play in Division 3 of the County Championship.\nHonours:\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 25 clubs affiliated with the Cumbria RU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level and are based in Cumbria.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Cumbria RU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in Cumbria:"

Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team was seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower competition.\nTeams will be taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw was used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1; the remaining team went into Tier 2. This allocation indirectly determined which fourth-seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others entered Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Continental Shield, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro12, qualifying teams are automatically included in Tier 4, and are, in effect, seeded equally despite officially being ranked 1/2 from \"that competition\".\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 8 June 2017, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland.\nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, both at home and away in the group stage, beginning on the weekend of 12/13/14 October 2017, and continuing through to 19/20 January 2018, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams are awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:"

On 7 September 2017, it was announced that the UK Government would be supporting the Birmingham bid meaning Liverpool would not proceed further.\nBackground.\nLiverpool was actually planning to bid for the 2026 Commonwealth Games. On 13 March 2017, Commonwealth Games Federation stripped Durban, South Africa of their rights to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games and reopened the bid process for the 2022 games. On 16 June 2017, Liverpool announced they would bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Brian Barwick was the chairman of the bid. Liverpool City Council, Mayor of Liverpool Joe Anderson Everton F.C. CEO Robert Elstone, English footballer Wayne Rooney, Liverpool F.C. CEO Peter Moore and coach Steven Gerrard also supported the bid.\nCost.\nThe total cost of hosting the Liverpool 2022 Commonwealth Games is anticipated to be in the region of £672 million (US$871 million), with £547 million (US$710 million) expected to come from the public sector. Liverpool City Council will contribute a quarter of this (£137 million) from its “invest to earn” strategy and existing resources as well as through various income steams raised from the Games.\nPlans.\nLiverpool's \"transformational plan\" for the 2022 games was predicted to accelerate £1 billion ($1.3 billion/€1.1 billion) of investment up to 10 years ahead of schedule and create more than 12,000 jobs. Liverpool was ranked as the UK's Greatest Sporting City for 2017, according to research from ESPN and the University of Bath.\nThe new Everton football stadium would accommodate a temporary athletics track for the Games. It is claimed this will be \"without any disruption to those features\" with the track due to be installed after the final home game of the 2021-2022 season and removed before the first scheduled match of the 2022-2023 campaign.\nThe city was also proposing to host swimming at a new 50 metres pool within the city centre dock system that would remain in place after the Games and provide both a swimming and visitor attraction legacy. Among the other proposals was triple jump, long jump and pole vault on the dockside by neighbouring Mann Island in the city.\nTwenty20 cricket and track cycling, as Liverpool 2022's \"optional sports\", would take place in Manchester at Old Trafford Cricket Ground and the Manchester Velodrome.\nOther key highlights of Liverpool's hosting plan included five existing venues. The Arena and Convention Centre Liverpool, home to the 11,000-seat Echo Arena, BT Convention Centre and Exhibition Centre Liverpool, would stage badminton, artistic gymnastics, judo, netball and wrestling. Liverpool FC's Anfield stadium was cited as the venue for the ceremonies and rugby sevens, while St George's Hall and Goodison Park would host the squash and boxing finals respectively and Stanley Park would stage the lawn bowls.\nAthletes’ Village would be beside Everton FC's new stadium in Nelson Dock, within Peel Land and Property's £5.5 billion ($7 billion/€6.3 billion) Liverpool Waters scheme - residential developments that already have outlined planning permission meaning construction could start in the first half of 2018.\nVenues.\nThe venues proposed for the games are the following:"

He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Texas Rangers in 2017 and 2018.\nProfessional career.\nTexas Rangers.\nRodríguez signed with the Texas Rangers as an international free agent on November 20, 2010. He made his professional debut in 2011 for the DSL Rangers, posting a 4–1 record with a 4.05 ERA in 20 innings. He repeated with the DSL Rangers in 2012, posting a 3–3 record with a 2.87 ERA in 47 innings. Rodríguez split the 2013 season between the DSL Rangers, the AZL Rangers of the Rookie-level Arizona League, and the Spokane Indians of the Class A Short Season Northwest League; posting a combined 0–4 record with a 3.09 ERA in 32 innings between the three levels. In 2014, he spent the season with the Hickory Crawdads of the Class A South Atlantic League, going 5–5 with a 3.07 ERA in innings (29 games - 12 starts).\nRodríguez appeared in five games for the Hickory and in two games for the Round Rock Express of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League, before he underwent season-ending Tommy John surgery in 2015. The surgery also caused him to miss the entire 2016 season rehabilitating. He began the 2017 season with the Down East Wood Ducks of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League and was later promoted to the Frisco RoughRiders of the Class AA Texas League. In 35 combined games, he posted a 5–1 record with a 1.34 ERA and 61 strikeouts over 47 innings.\nThe Rangers promoted Rodríguez to the major leagues on August 8, 2017, becoming the first Wood Duck to be promoted to the major leagues. Rodriguez made his debut on August 14, 2017, in a game against the Detroit Tigers, pitching one scoreless inning. He recorded his first career strikeout against Tigers batter James McCann and struck out the next batter, Alex Presley, as well. He ended the 2017 season after posting a 0–1 record with a 6.23 ERA over 13 innings in 16 games for Texas.\nRodríguez started the 2018 season on the 60–day DL with right biceps tendinitis and elbow inflammation. He rehabbed with Frisco and Round Rock before being activated off the DL and optioned to Round Rock. Between the two levels, he posted a combined 1–2 record with a 2.51 ERA and 28 strikeouts over innings. He recorded a 0–0 record with a 4.05 ERA in major league innings in 2018.\nOn November 30, 2018, Rodríguez was non-tendered by the Rangers and was granted free agency. Rodríguez was re-signed to a minor-league contract on February 5, 2019. It was also announced that Rodríguez had undergone shoulder surgery in December 2018, which caused him to miss the entire 2019 season.\nToros de Tijuana.\nOn April 18, 2023, Rodríguez signed with the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League. In 37 relief outings for the Toros, he posted a 2.61 ERA with 38 strikeouts across 38 innings pitched. Rodríguez was released by Tijuana on March 19, 2024."

        "text": "This is a list of current men's professional boxing rankings, which includes the latest rankings by each one of the sport's four major sanctioning bodies, as well as other well-regarded sites and entities.\nOverview.\nAs professional boxing has four major sanctioning bodies (WBA, WBC, IBF, WBO) each with their own champions, the sport doesn't have a centralized ranking system. The rankings published by these organizations share the trait of not ranking the other organizations' champions, as each one of the sanctioning bodies expects their champion to frequently defend their title against their top-ranked contender. The WBA often has more than one champion, none of which are ranked by the other 3 sanctioning bodies. Their \"Super\" and \"Regular\" champions are excluded from the rankings but their \"Interim\" champion is affixed to the #1 spot. The IBF's protocol is for the top 2 spots in its rankings to remain vacant until two of its other top-ranked contenders face off, at which point the winner takes one of those two places.\nIn addition to the rankings published by the major sanctioning bodies, the TBRB and \"The Ring\" each publish their own independent rankings, not excluding any organizations' champions. The aim of both the TBRB and \"The Ring\" is to crown a single champion for each division. These lists are subjective and derived by a committee. Since the 90s, other parties have experimented with objective computerized rankings, but these are sometimes regarded as incapable of accounting for all of boxing's quirks and subtleties. The most widely known computerized rankings are published by BoxRec and updated daily. The following is a list compiling the latest instalment of all the previously mentioned rankings. There are 18 weight classes ranging from Heavyweight to Strawweight."

        "title": "Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid",
        "text": "The Morocco 2026 FIFA World Cup bid was Morocco's unsuccessful bid to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup. It competed with the United 2026 bid of Canada, Mexico, and the United States for hosting rights.\nBackground.\nThe 2026 bid was Morocco's fifth bid to host the FIFA World Cup after four unsuccessful attempts in 1994, 1998, 2006 and 2010 lost out to the United States, France, Germany and South Africa. If successful, it would have been the second African country, after the 2010 tournament in South Africa to host a World Cup.\nBid process.\nBidding for the 2026 FIFA World Cup was postponed due to the 2015 FIFA corruption case and the subsequent resignation of Sepp Blatter, then it was restarted following the FIFA Council meeting on 10 May 2016, wherein the bidding process will consist of four phases:\nWith no rival bid having emerged since April 2017, the CONCACAF member federations of Canada, Mexico and the United States sent a joint request to FIFA to hasten the bid process. Canada, Mexico and the United States wanted FIFA to award the bid outside the traditional bidding process at the June 2018 FIFA Congress in Moscow if the CONCACAF bid meets FIFA requirements.\nHowever, the FIFA Council decided on 8 May 2017 that FIFA would have a full bidding procedure. To ensure continental rotation of hosting duties, only the member associations of CAF, CONCACAF, CONMEBOL and the OFC were invited, as these continental confederations had not hosted the two previous World Cups. A date of 11 August 2017 was set for submission of an intention to bid, and on that day, the Royal Moroccan Football Federation announced that it would submit a bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. In March 2018, the Morocco 2026 bid committee stated their plan to spend $16 billion on preparing for the tournament, including building new transportation infrastructure, 21 new hospitals, a large number of new hotels and leisure facilities and building and/or renovating new stadiums.\nFIFA Football tournament hosting experiences.\nMorocco have previously hosted a number of international football events.\nBid committee.\nOn 10 January 2018, King Mohammed VI appointed Moulay Hafid Elalamy as chairman of the bid committee.\nTwo days later the London-based agency VERO Communications was appointed as Lead Communications and Strategy Consultants of the Moroccan bid. \nBid venues.\nStadiums must have been able to accommodate a hospitality village no more than from the stadium. They must also have had a capacity of at least 40,000 for group and second round matches, 60,000 for the semi-finals, and 80,000 for the opening match and final. On 22 August 2017, Morocco established a list of stadia for its bid.\nHighways and roads.\nThe Moroccan highway network connects most large cities in the country, being part of the transportation infrastructure in Morocco.\nRail network and rail transport.\nAdditionally the rail network connects all the proposed venues except Tetouan, Ouarzazate and Agadir. However, there were plans for projects to connect Agadir to the Moroccan high speed network (TGV) via Marrakech, and to connect Tetouan to the classic rail network via Tangier.\nAirports and air transport.\nAll the selected cities (except El Jadida and Meknes) have their own airports; see list of airports in Morocco. The Mohamed V International Airport in Casablanca is the main international gateway into Morocco.\nSupport.\nPublic opinion.\nThe bid committee showed that 97% of Moroccans were in favour of the World Cup, including 81% with strong support. 93% of Moroccans thought the event would have had a positive impact on economy and employment, 91% of Moroccans thought the event would have had a positive impact on sports participation, and 95% of Moroccans were interested in playing football.\nGovernment support.\nIn January 2018, the Moroccan government stated its full support for Morocco's bid to host the 2026 World Cup.\nMarketing.\nThe logo was unveiled on 23 January 2018; it was inspired by the pentagram found on the Moroccan flag. The pentagram was surrounded by seven red leaves and kicking a football.\nThe slogan for the bid \"Together for One Goal\" (Arabic: \"معا لهدف واحد\") (French: \"Ensemble pour le même but\"), was launched on 17 March 2018.\nConcerns, criticism and controversies.\nIn FIFA's evaluation report of the two bids, Morocco's bid was rated as being \"high risk\" for the organisation, compared with the other bid being labelled as low risk. The three categories with the worst scores were: stadiums, accommodation and transportation, which are the most important parts of any bid for the World Cup. The overall bid scored 275 out of 500 points, significantly lower than the 402 scored by the other bid.\nIn Morocco's previous World Cup bids, it was discovered that in two of those instances, the country tried to bribe voting officials. FIFA issued an integrity warning to the Moroccan bid in January 2018. The general secretary of FIFA Fatma Samoura warned voters in a letter \"not to accept any technical or development support which may unduly affect the integrity of the bidding procedure\". Moroccan bid officials had at one point discussed a formal relationship with the Confederation of African Football (CAF) which would allow for training camps and other development activities for countries on the continent.\nThe aforementioned Samoura was referred to FIFA's ethics committee after it was discovered she had familial links to El Hadji Diouf, an ambassador of the bid. There was a complaint that deemed this relationship to be a conflict of interest.\nThe transportation plans put forward by the bid team were rated as being of high risk for FIFA. Out of all the sections of the bid that were scored, the transportation section received the lowest at 2.1 out of 5. Concerns were raised over the dependence of just one airport for most of the flights (in Casablanca) and the lack of transportation links within cities and stadiums. According to FIFA, the bid relied on high cost infrastructure across all modes of transportation in a shorter amount of time.\nThe Moroccan bid would have needed to spend about US$16 billion in upgrades to stadiums, building new stadiums and infrastructure. This represented about 16% of the country's GDP (US$100 billion). This was compared with only 6% for public health. Increased spending for the World Cup, while social services receiving cuts caused a lot of protests during the last World Cup held in 2014 in Brazil. There were no legacy plans for all the newly built stadiums. This was in contrast to the North American bid, which exclusively used existing stadiums and did not require any of the host countries to take on debt.\nFIFA had to make a second unscheduled visit to Morocco, after the governing body was not satisfied with the requirements presented in the bid book as deficiencies were discovered, unlike the North American bid. Morocco's bid leader \"acknowledged it had to improve the quality of the submission made to FIFA in March [2018] because inadequacies were identified\" (by FIFA). When the bid was announced, only a two sentence statement was announced announcing the country's entrance into the competition. With less than six months remaining, Morocco named a chairman for its bid committee and did not have a logo or a website. This was in contrast with the North American bid, which was well ahead in planning at that point.\nFIFA's bid evaluation committee expressed concerns over the quality of stadiums proposed by the Moroccan bid. The committee \"'noticed some deviations from the initial planned program\" [in relations to the stadiums proposed]. Concerns were also raised over the quality of training grounds proposed. The president of the bid, Moulay Hafid Elalamy, mentioned that there was a need to \"improve the quality of our bid book\". The Moroccan stadiums need extensive modernisation to match the stadiums proposed by the North American bid. The stadium plans put forward by the bid team were rated as being of high risk for FIFA.\nFIFA criticised the bid for including several potential white elephant stadiums — expensive venues which their owners could not dispose of and whose costs, particularly those for maintenance, were out of proportion to their usefulness — compared with the North American bid, which used venues that were already in use by professional sports teams. This was done after Morocco complained of the bid process. FIFA replied, \"In order to avoid unsustainable bids ... with the creation of 'white elephants' – something FIFA has been heavily criticised for in the past – the scoring system evaluates with objective criteria how meaningful and sustainable is the infrastructure presented in the bids\". Morocco was expected to spend US$16 billion if successful in tournament infrastructure, while the North American bid needed no new tournament-specific infrastructure. This put much more risk on FIFA if it selected the Moroccan bid, as listed in the evaluation committee's review of the two bids. The Moroccan bid committee accepted the fact that it could not host the event tomorrow, but the North American bid could.\nSecurity was a concern for the bid. Morocco is in the North African region which has experienced political instability and terrorist attacks in neighbouring countries of Tunisia, Libya and Egypt. A terror attack happened in 2011 in Marrakesh, a proposed host city for the bid. A total of 17 people were killed in the attack at Jemaa el-Fnaa Square, which was also the proposed fan site if the bid was successful.\nFIFA rated the bid with a medium risk for human rights and labour standards. Further concerns were raised when stray dogs were put to death by being shot while the FIFA inspection committee was there.\nMorocco did not mention that homosexuality is illegal in the country in its bid book. There was also no attempt how this would be mitigated (for LGBT athletes and fans) if the country was given the right to host the World Cup. FIFA's guidelines for World Cup hosts explicitly mentioned that \"host countries must guarantee there is no discrimination of any nature\". Ahmed El Haij, president of the Moroccan Association for Human Rights, told the Associated Press, \"it is evident that if Morocco was to host the World Cup, LGBT people coming to watch the games will face a lot of discrimination. The state will not be able to protect them nor will it be able to commit in preventing measures that could be taken against them by both the state and society\".\nThe Morocco bid projected a revenue of just US$785 million, which was less than half of what the North American bid projected (at US$1.8 billion). This was the primary reason that FIFA president Gianni Infantino thought of preferring the North American bid.\nIn its bid book, Morocco acknowledged issues with \"ultra\" fans, which are also known as violent supporters. This was highlighted in February 2018, when 65 people were arrested and vandalism was caused at a stadium in Marrakesh.\nFIFA expressed concerns over Morocco's hotel capacity. The country was expected to invest US$3.2 billion in hotel capacity in the lead-up to 2026, if successful in the bid. The evaluation committee had multiple questions in regards to the capacity of the accommodation proposed. About an additional 30,000 hotel rooms were thought to be needed for Morocco to stage the World Cup. The accommodation plans put forward by the bid team were rated as being of high risk for FIFA, while the North American bid was rated as low risk.\nThere were calls in some countries to not support the bid, due to the Western Sahara conflict. South Africa did not support the bid, after ties between the two nations were strained since 2004 over the Western Sahara issue. Other countries such as Namibia also ruled out voting for Morocco, after it claimed, \"It will never support nor align itself with a coloniser\".\nAftermath.\nAfter losing the 2026 bid, Morocco went on to bid for the 2030 edition and was later unanimously awarded in a joint bid with Portugal and Spain, giving Morocco to finally host it on their sixth attempt with centenary games to be held in the South American countries of Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay."

They were led by interim head coach David Padgett after former head coach Rick Pitino was fired due to an FBI investigation into the school. They finished the season 22–14 overall, and 9–9 in ACC conference play, finishing in a tie for 8th with Florida State, who they defeated in the second round of the ACC tournament before losing to Virginia in the quarterfinals. They received an invitation to the NIT, where they defeated Northern Kentucky in the first round and Middle Tennessee in the second round before being defeated in the quarterfinals by Mississippi State.\nFollowing their NIT quarterfinal loss, Louisville announced that Padgett would not be retained as head coach. On March 27, 2018, Xavier head coach Chris Mack was hired by Louisville.\nPrevious season.\nThe Cardinals finished the 2016–17 season with a record of 25–9, 12–6 in ACC play to finish in a three-way tie for second place.

They defeated #15 Jacksonville State in the First Round before being upset by #7 Michigan in the Second Round.\nFBI investigation.\nOn September 26, 2017, federal prosecutors in New York announced that the school was under investigation for an alleged \"pay for play\" scheme involving recruits at Louisville. The allegations state that an Adidas executive conspired to pay $100,000 to the family of a top-ranked national recruit to play at Louisville and to represent Adidas when he turned pro. The criminal complaint does not name Louisville specifically but appears to involve the recruitment of Brian Bowen, a late, surprise commit to the school. On September 27, head coach Rick Pitino and athletic director Tom Jurich were placed on administrative leave.\nAssistant coach David Padgett was named interim head coach on September 29. On October 6, the school also placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on administrative leave. On October 11, Louisville announced that Trent Johnson, former head coach at LSU and Stanford, was hired as an assistant coach. On the same day, the school announced assistant coach Jordan Fair had been fired. On October 19, Louisville hired former Ohio State assistant Greg Paulus as an assistant.\nOn October 16, 2017, the school officially fired Rick Pitino as head coach.\nRoster.\nOn September 27, 2017, the school suspended Brian Bowen from the team due to the ongoing FBI investigation.

        "text": "Buenos Aires Rowing Club is an Argentine sports club sited in Tigre, Buenos Aires, 30-km distance from the Buenos Aires autonomous city. Founded in 1873 and originally headquartered in the capital city, BARC is the oldest rowing club of Argentina.\nApart from rowing, other sports held by the institution are canoe racing, football, swimming, tennis, artistic gymnastics and roller skating.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nRowing was introduced in Argentina by British immigrants in the 1870s. A group of enthusiasts joined the port of Buenos Aires with Tigre (then named \"Las Conchas\") in about 3 hours. The first rowing clubs were Buenos Aires Rowing Club (established in 1873) and the Club de Regatas La Marina (1876), both located in the capital city while the first official regatta was held on December 8, 1873, with representatives from different countries taking part of it. President Domingo Sarmiento was one of the notable personalities that attended the event.\nDespite of being a difficult access place, Tigre had optimal conditions to the practise of rowing. Because of that, the BARC members set a precarious box there to storage their boats to be used on weekends.\nThe practise of rowing spread with the establishment of a third club, Rosario Rowing Club (sited in the homonymous city) in Santa Fe Province, 1887.\nThe yellow fever epidemic on Buenos Aires and the development of the railway network in the country were two factors that substantially influenced rowing clubs originally established in Buenos Aires to set their locations in Tigre, where they soon moved.\nFifteen years after being formed, the British-origin members of BARC separated from the institution to form their own institution, Tigre Boat Club (the first of that district) in 1888. In December 1901, the Argentine Rowing Association (\"Asociación Argentina de Remo\") is founded, with the six clubs existing by then: Buenos Aires Rowing Club, Club de Regatas La Marina, Tigre Boat Club, Club de Remo Teutonia (founded by the German community), Campana Boat Club and Club de Regatas Bella Vista.\nConsolidation.\nOn December 6, 1873 (six days after the first regatta was held), the rowers that had taken part in it met in the coffeehouse \"Gymnasium\" sited on Florida and Corrientes Avenue in Buenos Aires with the purpose of establishing a club. Supported by the British Consul in Argentina, they founded the \"Buenos Aires Rowing Club\" which became the first rowing club in the country. The BARC founder also agreed to accept all the rowing enthusiasts as members, including non-British citizens.\nAn old ship (\"Sunny South\") was the first seat of BARC until a neighbor, Leonardo Pereyra, donated a land bordering Matanza River and a wood shack was built there. In 1876 the club built another shack in Tigre. In 1885 the club acquired a 1,600 m2 land in the same region where a building would be constructed at a cost of $10,000.\nIn 1895 the seat in Riachuelo moved to Dársena Sur (La Boca), where the club remained until 1902 when it moved to a shed given by the Municipality of Buenos Aires that had been formerly used as slaughterhouse.\nThe main seat in Tigre was inaugurated in 1911. The building was refurbished and expanded in 1913. The main facade was modified to a Victorian architecture style."

They finished the season 14–19, 4–14 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for 11th place.

In the Big Ten tournament, as the 7th seed, Iowa was upset by 10th-seeded Indiana in the second round. Iowa was one of the First Four teams out of the NCAA tournament, which earned the team a No. 1 seed in the National Invitation Tournament. They defeated South Dakota in the first round before losing to eventual NIT champions TCU in overtime in the second round.\nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018 Big Ten tournament will be held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Due to the Big East's use of that venue for their conference tournament, the Big Ten tournament will take place one week earlier than usual, ending the week before Selection Sunday. This could result in teams having nearly two weeks off before the NCAA tournament. As a result, it is anticipated that the Big Ten regular season will begin in mid-December. Coaches have requested that no Big Ten game be scheduled between Christmas and New Year's Day, accordingly each team will play two conference games in early December before finishing non-conference play. \n!colspan=9 style=| European Tour\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition \n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\nSee also.\n2017–18 Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team"

Finally, in his senior year, he averaged 15.8 points, 5.1 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 1.1 steals, and 1.0 blocks per game in 29 games played. During his time at Dayton, he became the only player to have two seasons with averages of 1 assist, 1 steal, and 1 block per game with 37.5% three-point shooting and 5 free-throw attempts per game.\nProfessional career.\nWhile he was originally projected to be a second round pick in the 2017 NBA draft, he ultimately went undrafted. After the draft, he played with the Minnesota Timberwolves for the 2017 NBA Summer League, with the intent on signing with them afterwards. In the five games he played for the Timberwolves, he recorded 10 points, 3 rebounds, and 1 steal per game in 20.8 minutes of action. Cooke ultimately wouldn't sign a deal with the Timberwolves. Instead, on August 2, 2017, Cooke signed a two-way contract with the New Orleans Pelicans. That meant for the majority of the season, Cooke would split his professional time between the New Orleans squad and a G-League affiliate that's going to be best designated to them by the league before the season begins, which turned out to be the Greensboro Swarm. He made his NBA debut on October 28, 2017, playing in two minutes and scoring two points in a blowout 123–101 win over the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nOn October 7, 2018, Cooke signed with the Miami Heat. He was waived by the Heat on October 11 after appearing in one preseason game. Cooke was subsequently added to the roster of the Sioux Falls Skyforce. On March 15, 2019, Cooke signed a 10-day contract with the Miami Heat, and was immediately assigned back to the Skyforce.\nOn August 31, 2019, De' Longhi Treviso of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A (LBA), but released at mid-season, replaced by Ivan Almeida.\nAfter the short Italian stint, Cooke signed in Puerto Rico for the Atléticos de San Germán as first team's import player of the 2020 season.\nOn June 1, 2021, Cooke signed with the Hamilton Honey Badgers of the Canadian Elite Basketball League.\nOn February 15, 2022, Cooke was acquired and activated by the Maine Celtics, but was waived on March 2."

        "text": "The men's 100 metres at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the London Olympic Stadium on . This meet was announced as the last competition for Usain Bolt. The race was won by Justin Gatlin of the United States, ahead of Gatlin's team-mate Christian Coleman, with Usain Bolt finishing third.\nBackground.\nBilled as his last individual race, world record holder and reigning world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt hoped to bow out of individual competition with one last gold medal. He originally planned to retire after the Summer Olympics in Rio De Janeiro the previous year, but decided to return due to his love for the London crowds. However, his season was hampered by his reoccurring hamstring injuries, as well as the death of his friend Germaine Mason. Coming into the championships, Bolt was only ranked 7th with 9.95 seconds. Meanwhile, young American Christian Coleman burst onto the athletics scene as the new favorite to dethrone Bolt, clocking a world-leading 9.82 seconds at the NCAA Championships and going on to win the 100-200 double. His only defeat came at the US Championships, where fellow Tennessee Vol and 2004 Olympic champion Justin Gatlin overtook the inexperienced Coleman, who overstrided towards the finish. The win came as a surprise for many, as the 35-year old veteran and 2005 world champion had an unusually rocky season despite being Bolt's biggest rival for the previous 4 years. Andre De Grasse of Canada also announced his intentions to defeat Bolt before his retirement; the triple medallist at the Rio Olympics proved he had the talent and confidence to stay calm against Bolt, especially when he rushed to the Jamaican's shoulder during the 200m semifinals. Despite not having gone under 10 seconds before the championships, many knew that De Grasse was a championship performer and would clock much faster times in London.\nMeanwhile, Bolt's training partner and 2011 World Champion Yohan Blake, continued his injury comeback by winning the Jamaican 100m title in 9.90, the second fastest time of the year. Julian Forte and Senoj-Jay Givans, two sub-10 runners, filled out the Jamaican squad. Akani Simbine of South Africa was ranked 3rd in the year with 9.92, and won at the Doha Diamond League in May, though many believed he peaked too early as South African runners began their seasons in February. Christopher Belcher, the NCAA bronze medallist behind Coleman and ranked 4th in the year with 9.93, joined Coleman and Gatlin on the US squad. CJ Ujah of Great Britain appeared to be in top form, winning 3 Diamond League races in Rome, London, and Rabat, the latter in 9.98 seconds. In his absence, the incredibly fast-finishing Reece Prescod beat out former European Champion James Dasaolu at the British Championships. Other key players included co-European record holder and 3-time global finalist Jimmy Vicaut of France, 7th-ranked Thando Roto of South Africa, and Rio finalist Ben Youssef Meite of the Ivory Coast\nJust days before the championships, De Grasse pulled out with a hamstring injury and was forced to miss his final chance to defeat Bolt.\nSummary.\nColeman won his heat with ease in 10.01. Japanese runner Abdul Hakim Sani Brown placed himself as a favorite and surprised many by beating Blake in the second heat. Julian Forte of Jamaica was the fastest in the round, clocking 9.99 seconds in the third heat; Simbine finished 4th and qualified for the semis as a fastest loser, almost confirming claims he had already peaked earlier in the season. In the final heat, Bolt won with his slowest time of the season; his terrible start showed signs that he was, indeed, retiring at the right time.\nIn the first semi-final, Justin Gatlin qualified but seemed to struggle, losing to Akani Simbine of South Africa. Both were favorites to dethrone Bolt. In the second semi-final, Yohan Blake barely held off the hometown favorite Reece Prescod, who had a sudden surge of speed in the last ten metres to take the automatic qualifying spot from Su Bingtian of China. Run into slight headwinds, the first two semis were unimpressive, slower than ten seconds. In the third semi-final, Christian Coleman surprised the world by beating Bolt with 9.97 to his 9.98, despite it being a semi-final; in doing so, he became the first man in four years to beat Bolt, the last being Gatlin by the same margin (0.01) in an IAAF Diamond League event in Rome. Coleman rocketed out of the start, while Bolt lumbered. Bolt tried to make up the gap, but sensing he couldn't catch him, eased up at the finish. Bolt's time was still the second fastest in the semis.\nIn the final, Bolt was lined up in lane four, right next to his young rival Coleman. Gatlin lined up in lane eight, with Blake right next to him. At the gun, Coleman got the quickest reaction time, of 0.123, and Bolt with the second slowest in 0.183. Coleman continued with his usual fast start, with Bolt next to him lumbering behind by a metre in fourth expecting to make up ground on Jimmy Vicaut of France and Su Bingtian inside him. Meanwhile, the other half of the field seemed to struggle in the first 40 metres, but began to catch up with the pack afterwards. At that mark, Bolt began making up ground, first on Su, then on Vicaut. With every step, Bolt gained on his young rival, but as he got closer he began to tense up. Suddenly, with 15 metres to go, Gatlin in lane eight came out of nowhere and surged ahead of the two, securing his first world title since 2005 by 0.02 seconds. Gatlin's winning time of 9.92 seconds was the slowest World Championship winning time in the 100 metres since 2003, but was a new Masters world record, beating Kim Collins' 9.93 that he set the previous year. Coleman finished second in 9.94 seconds, while Bolt was third in 9.95 seconds, equaling his seasonal best that he set in Monaco.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 10.12.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\nPreliminary round.\nThe preliminary round took place on 4 August in four heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next two fastest ( q ) qualified for the first round proper.

While she was the first to throw over 70 metres in this competition, the next thrower, the home team's Sophie Hitchon threw better. By the end of the round, four more women threw better, the early leader was Włodarczyk's Polish teammate Malwina Kopron with a throw of 74.46 metres. In the second round, Wang Zheng jumped from second to first with a throw of 75.94 metres. The third Pole in the competition Joanna Fiodorow moved into third place with a throw of 73.02 metres. In the third round, Fiodorow was displaced by Zhang Wenxiu, then three throwers later by Hanna Skydan with a throw of 73.38 metres. During that round, Włodarczyk had improved to 71.94 metres, but was in sixth place only 60 centimetres ahead of the last qualifying spot for the final three attempts. In the fourth round, Włodarczyk finally broke through getting off a throw of 77.39 metres to take the lead. Nobody would be able to improve upon that, but Włodarczyk wasn't done, throwing 77.90 metres in the fifth round. Wang threw her best of 75.98 metres on her final attempt but it couldn't catch Włodarczyk.

There were no Olympic podium athletes in this field. The returning silver medalist Adam Kszczot (Poland) made an impressive move in his semi-final to get into the final. The returning bronze medalist, 2015 phenom Amel Tuka (Bosnia and Herzegovina) didn't make it out of the heats. The fastest athlete of the year Emmanuel Kipkurui Korir didn't qualify from his semi.\nAs the final began, the runner with the fastest personal best, =#3 all time Nigel Amos (Botswana) ran a fast turn and was attempting to take the tangent from the break line in his lane 5, but Brandon McBride (Canada), ran a faster turn and cut more sharply from lane 7, effectively interrupting Amos from taking control of the early pace. Looking for running room Amos also cut in, tangling elbows with Kipyegon Bett (Kenya), then bouncing to the side, getting caught also behind Thiago André (Brazil). McBride held the lead with André in his shadow. The first time down the home stretch, Amos moved outside to get around André into second place. McBride led through a moderate 50.76 first lap. Through the next turn, Bett was looking to get past Amos, finally also running wide on the backstretch, getting past McBride. From the back of the pack, Pierre-Ambroise Bosse (France) had avoided the battle so far. He went wider on the backstretch, running in lane 3 past the field, including the battling leaders, taking the lead unencumbered as they entered the final turn. Through the final turn, the battle continued behind him, Amos and Bett exchanging elbows again. From near the back of the back Adam Kszczot (Poland) began his kick, with Kyle Langford (GBR) in his wake, passing people. By the time he reached the final straightaway, Bosse had a 3 metre lead on Bett, with Amos another metre back. Bett and Amos were unable to gain on Bosse, but in lane 2, Kszczot and Langford were, passing people including Mohammed Aman (Ethiopia), Amos and 10 metres before the finish, Kszczot passed Bett to capture silver. Bett barely held off a fast closing Langford for bronze.\nAfter the race, Bosse looked at the video scoreboard, pointing at himself in surprise at his win.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nNo records were set at the competition.\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 1:45.90.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 5 August in six heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next six fastest ( q ) qualified for the semifinals.

        "text": "The 2017–18 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represented the University of Connecticut (UConn) during the 2017–18 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Huskies, led by Hall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma, in his 33rd season at UConn, played their home games at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and the XL Center and were fifth-year members of the American Athletic Conference. They finished the season 36–1, 16–0 in AAC play, to win the AAC regular season championship. They defeated Tulane, Cincinnati, and South Florida to win the AAC women's tournament title. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As the overall No. 1 seed, they defeated Saint Francis (PA) and Quinnipiac to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. They defeated Duke in the Sweet Sixteen and South Carolina in the Elite Eight to reach their 19th Final Four. In the National Semifinal, they lost in overtime on a last-second shot for the second consecutive year, this time to Notre Dame, ending the school's 36-game winning streak.\nPrevious season.\nThe Huskies finished the 2016–17 season 36–1, 16–0 in AAC play, to win the AAC regular season championship. They defeated Tulsa, UCF, and South Florida to win the AAC women's tournament championship. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As the overall No. 1 seed, they defeated Albany and Syracuse to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. In the Sweet Sixteen, they defeated UCLA to advance to the Elite Eight where they defeated Oregon. In the National Semifinal, they lost in overtime to Mississippi State, ending the school's 111-game winning streak.\nOffseason.\nFIBA.\nKia Nurse participated on the Canada women's national basketball team in the 2017 FIBA Women's AmeriCup event. This is a tournament that takes place every other year between the national teams of the two continents. It also serves as a qualifying tournament for the Olympic games. In the gold-medal game against the host team Argentina, the Canadians were behind by seven points at halftime but they came back in the second half, Nurse had a basket with just over a minute left to give Canada the lead for good and the gold-medal.\nFIBA U19.\nMegan Walker, Crystal Dangerfield, and Christyn Williams (Central Arkansas Christian Schools, with a verbal commitment to Connecticut) all participated on the United States women's national under-19 basketball team which competed in the FIBA Under-19 Women's Basketball World Cup, held in Udine, Italy in July. The USA team faced an undefeated Russia in the gold medal game, but fell short, losing 86–82. Dangerfield scored 15 points in the final, which resulted in the silver medal for the USA. For the entire event, Dangerfield averaged 9.0 points per game, Walker averaged 7.6 and Williams averaged 3.2.\n3x3 U18.\nChristyn Williams was one of four players selected to represent the US in the FIBA 3x3 U18 World Cup held in Chengdu, China in June and July. Williams scored 22 points over the course of the seven games to help the USA win all seven games, including the gold-medal game against the Czech Republic.\nRoster.\nAndra Espinoza-Hunter was only on the roster for the fall semester, after which she transferred from UConn.\nGame summaries.\nExhibition.\nNetherlands national team.\nThe UConn team took a trip to Italy in August, interspersing visits to historical sites with exhibition games against Dutch, Italian and Slovenian basketball teams. The first game was against the Netherlands national team on August 14, 2017 in Rome, Italy. Collier led the team in points and rebounds with 16 and 11, respectively, helping UConn to a 68–52 in over the national team. Nurse was not present for that game as she was still playing for the Canadian national team in the FIBA AmeriCup tournament.\nThe next day, the two teams faced off again. Nurse was present for this game and contributed 18 points, although high-scoring honors went to her teammate Samuelson with 23 points. UConn won the game 88–66.\nItalian All-stars.\nThree days later, UConn took on a team called the Italian All-Stars in Vicenza, Italy. Samuelson repeated her scoring performance with 23 points, while freshman Walker was the leading rebounder with nine. Dangerfield had 88 assist with no turnovers. Samuelson scored 15 of her points in the first quarter, helping the team to a 17-point lead — the team then continued on to a 103–45 victory.\nCelje.\nThe final exhibition game was held in Trieste against Celje, a Slovenian women's basketball club. UConn held a slim lead at halftime 37–36, playing without Collier who had injured her ankle in the prior game. However, in the third quarter the Huskies were outscored 25–10 and ended up losing the game 79–59. Samuelson was the high scorer with 17 points but only hit one of her six three-point attempts. The Huskies hit just 32% of their field-goal attempts.\nFort Hays State.\nUConn took on Division II Fort Hays State in their first exhibition game at home. The starters were the four returning starters from the previous year plus Dangerfield. Stevens came in off the bench and recorded 15 points and four blocked shots in the game. Nurse was the leading scorer with 19 points, while both Williams and Collier had nine rebounds each. UConn won the game easily 82–37.\nAshland University.\nThe final exhibition game was against Division II Ashland University, who won the Division II national championship in the prior year and came into the season with a longest winnings streak in the country at 37 games. Both teams were ranked number one in the preseason polls. Ashland's Laina Snyder had a double double with 12 points and 10 rebounds while Julie Whorley led the team in scoring with 17 points. For the Huskies, nurse led all scorers with 21 points hitting all of her seven shots from the field. Stevens and Williams each had double doubles, with Stevens scoring 16 points and pulling down 11 rebounds while Williams had 11 points and 10 rebounds. UConn won the game 119–56.\nRegular season.\nStanford.\nThe UConn team opened their season on the road, playing in the Countdown to Columbus doubleheader against 10th-ranked Stanford. The Huskies had the good fortune to return three first-team All-American's (the only team in Division I women's basketball to do so this year). The fourth starter for the team, Nurse, was the starting guard on the Canadian Olympic team. The fifth starter was sophomore Dangerfield who had a good but uneven freshman year. However, she reached double figures in scoring halfway through the first quarter, and ended up hitting six of seven 3-point shot attempts. The Huskies opened up a 49–14 halftime lead. For the first time in four years, the opening game did not follow a successful national championship bid, so the team potentially could interrupt their back-to-back winning streak extending from 1993 to 1994. That streak was never seriously threatened in this game is UConn ended up with the win 78–53. It was the 22nd consecutive year that UConn has won their opening game.\nCalifornia.\nUConn played their home opener against 20th-ranked California. The Golden Bears led 4–3 early, but scored 23 of the next 25 points to take control of the game. The Huskies had a 19-point lead at the end of the first quarter, and cruised to an 82–47 win. The team unveiled a banner to honor Rebecca Lobo before the game to reflect her inclusion in the Naismith Hall of Fame in September. Dangerfield, Collier and Nurse shared scoring honors with 14 points each.\nMaryland.\nThe Huskies played their second home game of the season and their first home game at the XL Center against 15th-ranked Maryland. UConn's best shooter Samuelson had injured her foot in the prior game and was not able to play. Despite that every starter for UConn scored in double figures led by nurse with 21 points. It was the first start for Azure Stevens who had transferred to UConn from Duke and sat out the prior season. She had a double double with 18 points and 12 rebounds. The game was tied early at seven points apiece but the Huskies went on a 19–2 run to take control. Both teams struggled with ball control, combining for 45 turnovers. The final score, in favor of the Huskies, was 97–72.\nUCLA.\nUConn headed west to play UCLA, a team near Samuelson's hometown of Huntington Beach, but unfortunately her foot injury prevented her from playing. She is no longer on crutches and wearing a walking boot which she could be seen wearing along the sidelines shouting encouragement to her teammates. Despite playing the number five ranked team in the country, her teammates responded, opening up a 24-point lead at one point and ending with a 78–60 win over the Bruins. The audience of over 9,000 included Kobe Bryant and Ann Myers Drysdale.\nMichigan State.\nThe Huskies headed north on the next step in their West Coast trip to Matthew Knight Arena in Eugene, Oregon to take place part in the Nike PK80 invitational. They took on Michigan State, their first unranked opponent of the season, but a team with a 4–1 record. Stevens, who felt she had not performed well against UCLA, stepped up with 25 points, 16 rebounds and five assists to help UConn to a 96–62 win. She also reached the 1,000-point mark for her career, with 938 scored at Duke. UConn held the Spartans to just over 34% shooting from the field and dominated on the boards a rebounding Michigan State 46–18.\nNevada.\nUConn had never played the University of Nevada, so the game played at the Lawlor Events Center in Reno was the first time on the court for most players on the team. However, it was familiar ground for Williams, who led her high schools team to the state title in 2012 in that arena. She also spent time in the arena watching her father and her sister who both played basketball for Nevada. The game was set up as a homecoming game for the senior Williams. She scored 18 points although her coach Auriemma emphasizes her defensive prowess. Stevens had a double double with 17 points and 14 rebounds but the offensive star of the team was Nurse, scoring on all eight of her three-point attempts, and ending up with 27 points. It was the first ever nationally televised game for Nevada. UConn won 88–57.\nNotre Dame.\nThe game against the third-ranked and undefeated Notre Dame was highly anticipated, resulting in a sellout for the XL center. Connecticut lead at the end of the first quarter by four points, but the Irish responded with a 24–4 run to take a seven-point lead into halftime. The third quarter was close but Notre Dame extended the lead by a single point to enter the fourth quarter with an eight-point lead. UConn's Samuelson had missed the prior four games with the foot injury but was able to play in this game until the early in the fourth quarter when she reaggravated her foot injury and had to leave. Williams was battling migraines, and ineffective in the first half when she scored only two points on one of seven shooting and did not play the second half. Despite missing two of the top players, UConn outscored Notre Dame 26-9 in the fourth quarter, ending up with 80–71 victory. Five Huskies scored in double digits. Despite missing most of the fourth quarter Samuelson was leading scorer with 18 followed closely by Stevens with 17.\nDePaul.\nDePaul chose to have the official opening of their new Wintrust Arena on the night that UConn came to town. The Huskies quickly quashed any notion that the Blue Demons would christen their new arena with a win. Really in the game, UConn went on a 14–2 run, aided by back-to-back three-pointers from Dangerfield to set the tone for the game. Samuelson was cleared to play what started off slowly missing several over early shots but she ended up hitting half of her field-goal attempts to lead the Huskies with 20 points. It was not a one-person show as six different players scored in double figures. Collier had a double double with 17 points and 10 rebounds. The final score in favor of the Huskies was 103–69.\nOklahoma.\nUConn faced Oklahoma in a game technically on a neutral court, as it was neither the home court for Connecticut nor Oklahoma but playing in the Hall of Fame women's Holiday Showcase in Uncasville, Connecticut felt like a home game. The game itself almost seem like an afterthought, as it represented 1,000 wins for head coach Geno Auriemma, but Oklahoma tried to spoil the celebration. The Huskies had a 15-point lead at halftime—the Sooners cut that deficit to seven points midway through the third quarter when Connecticut responded with a 13–3 run to build the lead back to 17 points. After the final gun sounded on the 88–64 win the celebration began. Auriemma was treated to tributes from former players and a Hall of Fame jacket as well as a cake, but he wasn't expecting to see many members of his inaugural 1985 team in attendance.\nThe win moved Auriemma into company with two other women's basketball coaches who have reached the 1,000-win mark. Two of those coaches are Pat Summitt and Tara VanDerveer. In an odd coincidence, the third member of the club, Sylvia Hatchell, reached the milestone a few hours earlier. Auriemma reached the milestone faster than any other coach doing so with only 135 losses.\nDuquesne.\nUConn continued its tradition of scheduling a game near the hometown of seniors by playing Duquesne in Toronto, as a homecoming game for Nurse who is from Hamilton, Ontario. The game was a sellout, held at the Mattamy Athletic Centre. Nurse hit 9 of 11 field-goal attempts to score 24 points for the Huskies. It was not the first time that Nurse had played in this arena. She played there previously while in high school and when playing for the Canadian national team when she led the team to a win over the US in the Pan American games. However, it was the first time her grandparents had watched her play wearing a Connecticut jersey. Samuelson scored 33 points as the Huskies won the game 104–52.\nMemphis.\nUConn opened conference play with the game against Memphis on the day before New Year's. The start time was 1:30 PM, and the early start made it easy for fans to make it to the game. Just over 12,000, the largest crowd of the year, attended the game. Williams took ten shots and hit every one of them to score 20 points. Although Memphis had come into this game with a four-game winning streak, the Huskies won 97–49. They have now won every single one of their 83 conference games.\nEast Carolina.\nOne game after hitting 10 consecutive shots, Williams hit her first six shots and ended up hitting eight of nine against East Carolina. Samuelson recorded nine assists which matched a career high and Stevens recorded 16 rebounds to also tie a career high. Heather Macy, the coach of East Carolina said \"UConn dominated every facet\". UConn held the Lady Pirates to 25% shooting from the field and won the game 96–35.\nSouth Florida.\nConnecticut played the first two games against South Florida with this one played on the Bulls home court. The UConn offense was solid with Collier heading 12 of 15 field-goal attempts to record a season-high 25 points. The team hit 50% of their field-goal attempts and reached 100 points for the third time this season. However, the real key to the win was the Huskies defense. USF's Kitija Laksa Is the second-leading scorer in the conference averaging over 20 points a game, but she was held to zero points. The team as a whole hit under 30% of their field-goal attempts. The final score, in favor of the Huskies, was 100–49.\nUCF.\nUConn started out very slowly against Central Florida. The Huskies had a 13-point lead at halftime but the 32 points scored in the first half is the lowest scoring first half the season. The Knights physical defense was effective in slowing down Connecticut and coach Auriemma spent nearly the entire halftime explaining this to the team. They did not return to the court until there were less than 30 seconds left before the start of the third quarter. Whatever was said was effective as UConn scored 48 points in the second half. Stevens came off the bench to record 19 points to lead the Huskies in scoring. Auriemma praised Williams for \"energizing the team in the second half\". Her 13 rebounds and five assists help the Huskies in their third-quarter run. The final score in favor of Connecticut was 80–44.\nHouston.\nConnecticut's defense helped UConn to a 95–35 win over Houston. The Huskies held the Cougars to four points in the first quarter into a season-low 20% shooting percentage for the game. The Huskies were also strong offensively with Stevens recording a double double (19 points and 10 rebounds), and Samuelson and Nurse each scoring 17 points. The victory represented the 145th consecutive victory over and unranked opponent.\nTexas.\nUConn found itself in unusual territory—down by double digits in the first quarter. The Longhorns opened up with an 8–2 run to start the game, and expanded the lead to 10 points with the score 22–12. The Huskies responded, but were still down by three points at the end of the first quarter, the first time they had not held the lead at the end of the first quarter the season. Texas was still leading as the half wound down but Dangerfield stole the ball leading to a Collier basket to give UConn a one-point lead to 39–38. Free throws were critical for the Huskies, who hit their first 15 attempts from the charity stripe. However, Samuelson, usually a very solid free-throw shooter, had taken an inadvertent elbow to the eye earlier in the game, and missed two consecutive shots at the line in the final minute with UConn only leading by three points. Dangerfield hit two free throws with eight seconds left in the game to seal the 75–71 victory over ninth-ranked Texas.\nTulsa.\nUConn hosted Tulsa at home. Although the Huskies were up by 15 points at the end of the first quarter, and had finished the quarter on a 16–0 run, coach Auriemma was so dissatisfied with the play of the team he replaced all the starters with five bench players to start the second quarter. Each team would score 16 points in the second quarter, the first time in 21 quarters against AAC opponents that UConn fails outscore the opposition. The starters returned at the beginning of the third quarter but were able to outscore Tulsa only by two points in that period. Tulsa cut the lead to 10 points with just over five minutes left. Although UConn finished the game with a run to win 78–60, Auriemma described the team effort as \"the most disgraceful he's seen in the 32 years he has been coaching Connecticut\".\nTemple.\nUConn played Temple in Philadelphia in a game which featured Auriemma's former assistant, Tonya Cardoza, now head coach of the Temple Owls. Samuelson was unable to play due to an ankle injury, but that did not seem to slow down the Huskies, as Walker recorded a career-high 22 points and Nurse led all scorers with 24 points. The Owls' Mia Davis was noteworthy for scoring 19 points, but that was not close to enough, as UConn went on to win 113–57. UConn's coach Auriemma made a point of pulling aside Temple's Tanaya Atkinson and Davis for words of encouragement.\nMemphis.\nUConn had several players nursing injuries as they visited Memphis, but they were unlikely to elicit any sympathy as the Tigers were only able to dress six players. The Huskies were too much for the Tigers with five players in double figures versus only one for the Tigers. Connecticut won easily 93–36.\nTulane.\nUConn had typically beaten Tulane by wide margins, averaging 44 points in the three meetings before the February 18, 2017 game. However, in the most recent meeting played at Tulane, the game went down to the final possession with Connecticut winning 63–60. This meeting would end up more like the previous three than the recent close call, with UConn winning 98–45. UConn was up 53–19 at halftime and then the huskies really started to hit their shots going 13 for 14 or almost 93% in the third quarter. Tulane's leading scorer was held to two points. Napheesa Collier was perfect from the field, hitting all six of her shots, one of which was a three pointer. Samuelson led all scorers with 19 points, but she was one of six players with double-digit scoring.\nSouth Carolina.\nFacing the defending national champions is always an anticipated game, even when you are currently ranked number one in the nation. Adding the expected capacity crowd of 18,000 which showed up to cheer on the Gamecocks, and this game had the potential of being a close game. Crystal Dangerfield the starting point guard for UConn was also looking forward to playing against a former teammate Tyasha Harris. Both played on the FIBA U-19 World Cup in Udine, Italy, where they help the USA bring home the silver medal.\nSouth Carolina scored the first basket of the game, but the Huskies responded with a 13–2 run, to pull out to a 24–16 lead at the end of the first quarter. That the Huskies really poured it on going on a 17–two run to extend the lead to 23 points. While the crowd was heavily weighted in favor of South Carolina fans, UConn fans were able to make their cheers heard over the silence of the Gamecock fans. The second half is largely more of the same, save a brief 12–0 run by the South Carolina team but UConn responded and South Carolina never got close of the 24 points the remainder of the game, with UConn winning 83–58.\nCincinnati.\nFollowing the decisive win over South Carolina, Connecticut returned to conference play against Cincinnati at home. The team started slowly, down 11–9 in early going before going on a 23–0 run to end the quarter. The game was never close again, as all five Huskies starters scored in double digits with both Stevens and Williams recording double doubles. The team hit 56.5% of the field-goal attempts and went on to win easily 106–65.\nUCF.\nThe Huskies were ahead 21–4 at the end of the first quarter. Although UConn would extend the lead in the second quarter, Central Florida outscored Connecticut in the second half. UConn would end up with the win 55–37, 55 points is the fewest points scored by the team in six years.\nWichita State.\nUConn's game against Wichita State was the first ever meeting between the two opponents. Wichita State had switched from the Missouri Valley conference to the American Athletic Conference in the previous year. The last time Connecticut lost to a first-time opponent was in 1996, before any of the current players were born. However, despite the history, the Shockers were not quite prepared for the Huskies. UConn scored seven points before Wichita State even took a shot, and tightest school record with 41 points in the first quarter. They hit 71.6% of their field goal attempts which was the third best in history and ended up with their 87th consecutive win against a first-time opponent. The final score was 124–43. Collier scored 26 points on 11 for 13 shooting.\nLouisville.\nThe Cardinals outscored the Huskies in the third and fourth quarters and were only outscored by two points in the second quarter, but that was not enough to overcome a 24–6 margin by the Huskies in the first quarter. Louisville scored the first three points of the quarter but UConn then scored 19 consecutive points. The UConn defense held Louisville 20 points under their scoring average. Samuelson played all 40 minutes, scoring 26 points. Williams also played all 40 minutes and pulled down 15 rebounds.\nTemple.\nConnecticut had six players in double figures as they easily won their game against Temple 106–45. This game represented the 100th win for juniors Samuelson and Collier. Interestingly, the 100th win came in the 101st game. While winning 100 of 101 games is an NCAA record only tied a record, also held by three other UConn classes.\nTulane.\nThe Green Wave scored first, hitting a three-pointer on the first shot of the game, but the Huskies responded with a 28–4 run. Stevens ended up with 23 points while Collier scored 22. The Huskies recorded nine blocks while cruising to an easy win 91–47.\nSMU.\nIn their last regular-season road game, UConn played Southern Methodist University. The Mustangs outscored the Huskies in the fourth quarter, and most of the first quarter. UConn did not take the first lead until just over a minute remained in the first quarter. However, following the first media timeout at which SMU led 12–6, the Huskies scored 43 consecutive points. Only a free throw with 12 seconds left in the quarter prevented the Mustangs from going scoreless in the second quarter, but it was still the fewest points given up by UConn in a quarter since the format switched to quarters three years before. Samuelson was the leading scorer for the Huskies with 23 points hitting 5 of 8 three-point attempts. The final score was 80–36 in favor of UConn.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|AAC women's tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|NCAA women's tournament\nSource\nMedia.\nEvery single Connecticut game is expected to be televised.

        "text": "The women's pole vault at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on 4 and 6 August.\nSummary.\nIt essentially took a clearance at 4.50 metres to make it into the final. The one clearance (with earlier misses) brought 13 still in at 4.55 metres each thinking there was more work to do. Lisa Ryzih, Sandi Morris and Robeilys Peinado remained perfect at 4.55 metres, with Olympic Champion Katerina Stefanidi passing all the way until the automatic qualifier height of 4.60 metres.\nIn the final, four women were perfect to 4.55 metres including home team favourite, Holly Bradshaw, Yarisley Silva, Peinado and Morris with Stefanidi again still passing. At Stefanidi's starting height 4.65 meters, she cleared on her first attempt and was only matched with a perfect round by Morris. Ryzih, Peinado and Silva all missed once before clearing. Ryzih's earlier miss at 4.45 metres dropping out of the tie that defined the tied bronze medalists as none of them could go any higher. So it was a repeat battle from the Olympics. Morris and Stefanidi still perfect over 4.75 metres. At 4.82 metres, Morris missed but Stefanidi made it. Morris passed to try 4.89 metres for the win, but she couldn't make it. Neither did Stefanidi, but she really didn't need to. After Morris missed her last attempt, Stefanidi passed to 4.91 metres, which she made on her first attempt for a national record, stamping an exclamation point on her win. Stefanidi then moved the bar up to 5.02 metres try to join Morris and become the fourth woman over 5 metres and set a new championship record, but she missed all three attempts.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 4.55 metres.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\nQualification.\nThe qualification round took place on 4 August, in two groups, with Group A starting at 19:50 and Group B starting at 19:49.

        "text": "The men's 4 × 100 metres relay at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the United kingdom,London Olympic Stadium on 12 August.\nSummary.\nAs the final was billed as Usain Bolt's final race, many eyes were on the Jamaican team, which put their hurdle gold medalist Omar McLeod on leadoff. Their main challenger was expected to be USA which put their 2015 anchor, Mike Rodgers on leadoff, and scheduled the fastest starter in the championships, Christian Coleman to run against Bolt on anchor. Earlier in the day, Bolt did anchor the team to qualify, minus McLeod. the home Great Britain team had run a strong semi final, and led a quartet with France, China and Japan who were expected to compete for bronze, and possibly take advantage of slip-ups from the 'Big 2'.\nOut of the blocks, USA and Jamaica were out about even, making up the stagger on Stuart Dutamby for France to their outside. Great Britain with Chijindu Ujah and on the far outside, Shuhei Tada for Japan were also out with them. A good British handoff to Adam Gemili had them passing China on their outside, while USA's 100 metre champion Justin Gatlin gained a step on Julian Forte for Jamaica. Into the third leg around the turn, USA's Jaylen Bacon maintained the lead against Jamaica's Yohan Blake, with Britain's Danny Talbot also ahead of Jamaica. Britain made a smooth blind handoff to Nethaneel Mitchell-Blake while Coleman took the baton off Bacon, Britain leaving the zone with a slight advantage, while Bolt had two metres to make up for Jamaica. Such a gain was expected to be within Bolt's ability but four steps into the straightaway, Bolt flinched in pain, hopping then somersaulting to the track. Mitchell-Blake and Coleman raced almost even until the last 20 metres when Mitchell-Blake pulled ahead and dipped at the finish line for an unexpected British win on home soil. 8 metres back, Japan came home with bronze, backing up their Olympic silver.\nMedical aid with a wheelchair and his Jamaican teammates surrounded Bolt on the ground. While the British men's and women's relay teams celebrated together, Bolt lay on the ground in pain for a couple of minutes then refused the wheelchair and was helped to his feet by his teammates. With them by his side he limped across the finish line for the final time then went back to the ground wincing in pain. 100 Metre Champion Justin Gatlin blamed Bolt's injury on the poor planning and the teams being sent out forty-five minutes late.\nDuring the final, the Chinese third leg runner Su Bingtian was accidentally hit on the head by Britain's second leg runner Adam Gemili as the former started his run. The Chinese side later decided not to make a post-race appeal and thus no further action was taken. \nGreat Britain's surprise gold, the first in the history of the event at the World Championships, and marked by a team with no individual medallists seeing off star-laced teams by means of superior technical baton changes, strong bend running and a notable \"esprit de corps\", drew immediate comparisons with the Great Britain 2004 Summer Olympic 4 x 100 metre relay champions who had triumphed in similarly unexpected circumstances, the only other major global victory for the nation.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification criteria.\nThe first eight placed teams at the 2017 IAAF World Relays and the host country qualify automatically for entry with remaining places being filled by teams with the fastest performances during the qualification period.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 12 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next two fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

Belgium's Robin Vanderbemden also looked to be having a strong leg all alone in lane 9. Coming down the homestretch, London sped up to have the USA the handoff first to Gil Roberts. Roberts came around the turn to take a 3-metre lead at the break, followed by GBR's Rabah Yousif and Spain's Lucas Búa, TTO's Jereem Richards was on the outside passing people. Into the far turn, he had beaten Yousif and kept going making up the gap on Roberts getting to within a metre. Down the homestretch, Roberts again opened up the gap, handing off to Michael Cherry three metres ahead of Trinidad and Tobago's handoff to Machel Cedenio. Great Britain's handoff to Dwayne Cowan was just a metre back as the top three teams had separated from the rest of the contenders. Through most of the lap, Cherry held a five-metre lead while Cowan was challenging Cedenio. Cedenio held off Cowan then on the homestretch he separated, making a run at Cherry. USA passed to Fred Kerley barely a metre ahead of TTO's pass to Lalonde Gordon. Kerley was the anchor runner of the fastest 4x400 relay of the year prior to the championships, running for Texas A&amp;M at the end of the college season more than two months earlier. Kerley held that one-metre lead down the backstretch, then widened it slightly through the final turn. Behind Gordon, GBR's Martyn Rooney was closing down the gap to bring his team to within a metre coming off the turn. Kerley straightened up and ran tight for the finish while Gordon went to the outside for running room and ran past him, pulling away to a decisive 3-metre victory. Kerley maintained his distance from Rooney to get silver for USA. GBR's Rooney finished 8 metres ahead of the Belgian team, which included three Borlée brothers.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification criteria.\nThe first eight placed teams at the 2017 IAAF World Relays and the host country qualify automatically for entry with remaining places being filled by teams with the fastest performances during the qualification period.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 12 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next two fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

World leader Rico Freimuth (GER), Götzis winner Damian Warner (CAN) had shown solid performances throughout the season. Olympic silver medallist Kevin Mayer(FRA) had the best PB of the athletes, but had not done a decathlon in 2017. Ilya Shkurenev (ANA) had scored more than 8600 points, but hadn't been competing with the rest of the decathletes for nearly two years because of the ban of the Russian team. Another question mark was behind Trey Hardee (USA), the champion of 2009 and 2011. If he was able to reproduce his form of earlier years, he could be a contender as well.\nThe first four times in the 100 metres were Warner, Freimuth, Karl Robert Saluri (EST) and Mayer. Warner's 10.50 was the best of the day but not as exceptional as his of 10.15. Sutthisak Singkhon (THA) had the best long jump, though still over 20 cm short of his best from July, his jump was a centimeter longer than Kai Kazmirek (GER), who moved into contention behind his teammate Freimuth and the other top 100 runners. In the shot put, Meyer assumed the lead with the second best throw behind Lindon Victor (GRN) 15.86. Hardee moved into third. Kazmirek moved into second place with the best high jump of the day , but Mayer maintained the lead as one of several to clear 2.08 m. And Kazmirek ended the first day still in second with the best 400 of 47.17 as Mayer's 48.26 kept him close enough to maintain the lead.\nStarting the second day, Warner's 13.63 hurdles put him back in third, with Freimuth and Mayer close behind to take the top two positions. Both Hardee and Shkurenev disappeared from the leader board after crashing over the fourth hurdle. With a discus throw, Freimuth gained over 4 metres on Mayer and pulled to within 24 points. A 48.79 m put Oleksiy Kasyanov (UKR) into third. Pau Tonnesen (ESP) have the best pole vault at 5.40 m but he was out of contention. Kazmirek and Mayer tied at the next best height to allow Mayer to separate in the lead and Kazmirek to move back to third. Janek Õiglane (EST) threw the javelin a 71.73 m in the javelin to move into fourth place, Mayer's was more than 3 and a half metres longer than the German teammates, giving him a solid lead going in to the final event. Mayer's 4:36.73 1500 beat both Germans to win going away. Kazmirek beat Freimuth by three and a half seconds in the race, but still finished 76 points behind him in the final tally.\nThe competition is notable for being the second decathlon in the World Championships history with the highest fraction of athletes (over 41%) not finishing the competition. The decathlon during the 1997 World Championships in Athletics similarly featured 34 athletes, of whom 14 were non-finishers.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standards.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 8100 points.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\n100 metres.\nThe 100 metres took place on 11 August in four heats as follows:\nThe overall results were as follows:\nLong jump.\nThe long jump took place on 11 August in two groups both starting at 11:11.

        "text": "Rowing Club Argentino is an Argentine rowing club sited in Tigre, Buenos Aires, 30-km distance from the Buenos Aires autonomous city. The institution –established in 1905– was one of the pioneers in the practise of the sport in Argentina.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nRowing was introduced in Argentina by British immigrants in the 1870s. A group of enthusiasts joined the port of Buenos Aires with Tigre (then named \"Las Conchas\") in about 3 hours. The first rowing clubs were Buenos Aires Rowing Club (established in 1873) and the Club de Regatas La Marina (1876), both located in the capital city while the first official regatta was held on December 8, 1873, with representatives from different countries taking part of it. President Domingo Sarmiento was one of the notable personalities that attended the event.\nDespite being a difficult-to-access place, Tigre had optimal conditions to the practise of rowing. Because of that, the BARC members set a precarious box there to storage their boats to be used on weekends.\nThe practise of rowing spread with the establishment of a third club, Rosario Rowing Club (sited in the homonymous city) in Santa Fe Province, 1887.\nThe yellow fever epidemic on Buenos Aires and the development of the railway network in the country were two factors that substantially influenced rowing clubs originally established in Buenos Aires to set their locations in Tigre, where they soon moved.\nFifteen years after being formed, the British-origin members of BARC separated from the institution to form their own institution, Tigre Boat Club (the first of that district) in 1888. In December 1901, the Argentine Rowing Association (\"Asociación Argentina de Remo\") was founded, with the six clubs existing by then: Buenos Aires Rowing Club, Club de Regatas La Marina, Tigre Boat Club, Club de Remo Teutonia (founded by the German community), Campana Boat Club and Club de Regatas Bella Vista.\nConsolidation.\nThe institution was founded on April 14, 1905 in Buenos Aires. Founding members met at the Ernesto Tornquist office to establish a club that encouraged the practise of rowing. The members that attend the assembly were Henry M. Edye, Samuel Kay (son), Henry B. Elliot, Jorge F. Elliot, Ramón L. de Oliveira César, Martin E. Miguens, Ernesto C. Simons and Enrique Jorge. Four of them were members of Buenos Aires Rowing Club (the oldest rowing club of Argentina, founded in 1873) and the rest came from Tigre Boat Club.\nOn September, the members committee approved the purchase of a 2,311 m2 land on the Luján River margins. The transaction had a cost of M$N 5,000, therefore the first building would be constructed there (with a cost of M$S 19,000). The money came from a loan and a mortgage. It was opened on May 6, 1906. The RCA had 201 members by then, that used the 11 boats and one racing shell.\nThe club debuted in the first official competition on November 11, 1908. Rowing Club Argentino achieved its first international trophies with two borrowed boats: the \"Club de Regatas La Marina\" and \"Copa Mihanovich\" competitions.\nIn 1910, Jorge Casares became president of the club, starting a period of 40 years managing the RCA. The second RCA building was opened in 1922, in the same place where the first seat had been constructed. The building was designed by architects Ezequiel Real de Azúa and Miguel Madero (selected through a competitive process which more than 30 professionals took part) at a cost of M$S 300,000.\nThe RAC was also the first rowing club to organise a long-distance regatta in Argentina, on June 1, 1930. The race runs on Luján River, Canal Arias and the mouth of Carapachay River on the Paraná de las Palmas, covering a distance of 25 km.\nNotable sportsmen.\nSome of the most remarkable athletes that have represented the RCA since its inception were:"

The team plays at the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). They compete in the Ivy League of the NCAA, where they have been since 1897. They play their home games at Palestra in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, named after palaestra, the ancient Greek wrestling school. \nThe men's team has had 19 official head coaches in its history. The team has played in 2,831 games over 116 seasons of collegiate play from the 1896–97 season to the 2016–17 season (excluding 1897 to 1901, when the Quakers did not play due to low attendance and lack of interest), compiling a record of 1742–1088–1 (.615).\nFor the first five years they played, the team had no coach. Russell Smith became the first head coach for the team in 1905. In Smith's four seasons as head coach, the team went 74–22–0 (.771), the best winning record out of any of the coaches in team history. The team made their first NCAA tournament appearance in 1953, under Howard Dallmar. 17 years later, Dick Harter was the next coach to bring the team to an NCAA Tournament bid. Under coaches Chuck Daly (1971–1977) and Bob Weinhauer (1977–1982), the team made nine tournament bids in 11 years, including an appearance in the Final Four. Fran Dunphy (1989–2006) compiled the most conference and overall wins as head coach with 310 wins and 191 wins, respectively. He also has the most NCAA Tournament appearances out of any head coach (10), but in nine of those appearances, the team was knocked out in the first round. , Steve Donahue is the current head coach for the team. In his two seasons as head coach, he has compiled a record of 24–32–0 (.429).\nList of coaches.\nSource: \nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2019 season began with the Wildcard Round on January 4, 2020, and concluded with Super Bowl LIV at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, on February 2, when the Kansas City Chiefs beat the San Francisco 49ers 31–20.\nFor the first time since 2010–11, the New England Patriots did not appear in the AFC Championship Game, and for the first time since 2015–16, they did not play in the Super Bowl, as they were eliminated in the wild-card round by the Tennessee Titans.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles' game against the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC wildcard round made the Eagles the second team in NFL history (the first being the Los Angeles Rams) to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least once.\nThis was the last postseason in which the NFL playoffs used a 12-team format, making it also the last postseason in which the #2-seeded team in each conference received a first-round bye.\nFor the first time in NFL history, two wild card playoff games went to overtime; all four games were decided by one score.\nSchedule.\nThe league announced on May 22 that the two divisional games played on the Sunday would be moved back from their traditional 1:00 and 4:30 p.m. (EST) start times to 3:05 and 6:40 p.m. (EST), respectively, matching the conference championship games. This is to provide greater flexibility for West Coast teams, who no longer will have to play away games on the East Coast at 10:00 a.m. (PST) or be restricted from hosting games in that early time slot.\nFor the first time in four years, both AFC wild card games were on Saturday, and both NFC wild card games were on Sunday (instead of one each per day, as in previous years).\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 4, 2020.\nAFC: Houston Texans 22, Buffalo Bills 19 (OT).\nHouston rallied back from a 16–0 third-quarter deficit – having been held to 62 total yards in the first half – to win with 3:20 remaining in overtime on Ka'imi Fairbairn's 28-yard field goal, for Buffalo's sixth consecutive playoff loss since their last win in .\nOn the opening drive of the game, Bills quarterback Josh Allen rushed for 42 yards – the Bills' longest rush of the season – and then caught a 16-yard touchdown pass from receiver John Brown on a trick play to put Buffalo up 7–0. In the second quarter, Devin Singletary rushed for an 18-yard gain and Allen completed a 28-yard pass to Brown as the Bills drove 69 yards in 11 plays to go up 10–0 on Stephen Hauschka's 40-yard field goal. Then after a punt, Buffalo drove 74 yards in 15 plays to score on a second 40-yard field goal from Hauschka, giving them a 13–0 lead at halftime.\nFive minutes into the third quarter, Texans receiver DeAndre Hopkins fumbled the ball while being tackled by Tre'Davious White, and Tremaine Edmunds recovered it on the Texans' 38-yard line. Buffalo then drove to the 12-yard line, but ended up settling for Hauschka's third field goal after Allen was sacked on third down by J. J. Watt, giving them a 16–0 lead. This time, Houston managed to respond, moving the ball 75 yards in 9 plays and scoring on a 20-yard touchdown run from quarterback Deshaun Watson; Watson also scored the ensuing two-point conversion to make the score 16–8. On the Bills' ensuing drive, linebacker Whitney Mercilus forced a fumble while sacking Allen, which Jacob Martin recovered for the Texans at midfield with 14:18 remaining. Watson then completed a 20-yard pass to Kenny Stills that set up Fairbairn's 41-yard field goal, cutting the score to 16–11.\nAfter Buffalo punted on their next drive, Watson completed a 41-yard pass – on the drive's second play – to Hopkins on the Buffalo 28-yard line, and later connected with tight end Darren Fells for 14 yards to bring up first and goal from the 1-yard line. Running back Carlos Hyde fumbled a pitch from Watson, then was forced out of bounds for a 4-yard loss after he recovered the ball. On the next play, he caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Watson. Hopkins caught Watson's pass for a two-point conversion, giving Houston their first lead at 19–16 with 4:42 remaining. Buffalo started out their next drive with a 38-yard completion from Allen to Singletary, and soon found themselves with a first down on the Texans' 25-yard line. After an incompletion, Frank Gore was dropped by Mike Adams for a 3-yard loss and then Allen was flagged for intentional grounding, pushing the team all the way back to the 42-yard line. Allen was sacked for a 19-yard loss by Martin on fourth-and-27, with a turnover on downs putting the Texans at Buffalo's 39-yard line with less than two minutes remaining. The Bills' defense managed to pin the Texans down, with Watson being stopped short by Star Lotulelei on fourth-and-1. Gaining the ball with 1:16 left, Allen led Buffalo 41 yards in 11 plays, including a 20-yard run by Allen, to score on Hauschka's 47-yard field goal, sending the game to overtime at 19–19.\nAfter both teams punted on their first drive of overtime – Buffalo had to punt after a penalty pushed them out of field goal range – Houston drove 73 yards in 9 plays for the game-winning score; the key play of the drive was an 18-yard completion from Watson to running back Duke Johnson on third-and-18 from the Texans' 19-yard line. Then Watson rushed for 5 yards, Stills caught a pass for 10 yards, and Hyde rushed 4 yards to the Bills' 44-yard line. On the next play, Watson evaded a sack attempt by two Buffalo defenders and fired a short pass to reserve running back Taiwan Jones, who took off for a 34-yard gain to Buffalo's 10-yard line. Fairbairn then kicked a 28-yard field goal to give Houston the victory.\nWatson completed 20 of 25 passes for 247 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 55 yards and a touchdown; Hopkins caught 6 passes for 90 yards. Allen completed 24 of 46 passes for 264 yards, while also rushing for 92 yards and catching a 16-yard touchdown pass. Singletary rushed for 58 yards and caught 6 passes for 76 yards. On the defense, Buffalo linebacker Matt Milano recorded 12 tackles (8 solo), while defensive end Trent Murphy had 6 tackles (4 solo) and 2 sacks.\nAFC: Tennessee Titans 20, New England Patriots 13.\nTennessee running back Derrick Henry accounted for 204 of the Titans' 272 total offensive yards, including 34 carries for 182 yards and a touchdown as he led his team to victory. For the Patriots, it was the first time they failed to win a playoff game in a season since 2010. As a result, New England's streak of AFC Championship appearances ended at eight.\nNew England took the opening kickoff and drove 57 yards in 8 plays, the longest a 21-yard completion from Tom Brady to tight end Benjamin Watson. Nick Folk finished the drive with a 36-yard field goal to put the Patriots up 3–0. Tennessee struck back, with Henry carrying the ball 6 times for 44 yards on a 75-yard drive, that gave the team a 7–3 lead with Ryan Tannehill's 12-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Firkser, the first playoff touchdown scored by a Harvard University graduate. New England then moved the ball 75 yards in 10 plays, featuring a 25-yard run by Sony Michel. Receiver Julian Edelman finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run – his first such touchdown – on an end around play on the first play of the second quarter, giving the Patriots a 10–7 lead. Later on, Patriots receiver Mohamed Sanu returned a punt 23 yards to the Titans' 47-yard line, and the team drove on to a first and goal on the 1-yard line. The Titans held out on the goal line; linebacker Rashaan Evans dropped Michel for a 1-yard loss on first down, Rex Burkhead was tackled on the 1-yard line by Evans and DaQuan Jones on second down and Evans tackled Michel for a 2-yard loss on third down. The Patriots took a 13–7 lead on Folk's 21-yard field goal with 2:16 left in the half. Henry took off for a 29-yard gain on the first play of the team's ensuing drive, before picking up 23 more yards with his next three carries after an incompletion. Henry then ran a screen pass 22 yards to the Patriots' 1-yard line, ultimately converting a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Titans a 14–13 halftime lead.\nThis would turn out to be the last offensive score of the game, as both teams combined for a total of 9 punts in the second half. New England got a mild scoring chance when Duron Harmon intercepted a pass from Tannehill – who finished with 72 passing yards – at New England's 41-yard line, but the offense could only move the ball to Tennessee's 47-yard line before being forced to punt. In the final minute of the game, Tennessee punter Brett Kern's 58-yard kick pinned the Patriots back at their own 1-yard line. On the next play, Titans defensive back Logan Ryan, who formerly played for New England, intercepted Brady's pass and returned it for a 9-yard touchdown, making the final score 20–13 after a failed two-point conversion attempt. This would end up being Brady's last game with the Patriots, as he left New England in free agency and signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the offseason.\nSunday, January 5, 2020.\nNFC: Minnesota Vikings 26, New Orleans Saints 20 (OT).\nDespite fumbling the ball on the second play of the game, Adam Thielen ultimately led the Vikings to victory with 7 receptions for 129 yards, including a 43-yard catch in overtime that set up the game winning score from tight end Kyle Rudolph, giving the Vikings their first playoff win on the road since January 2005.\nJanoris Jenkins tackled Thielen to force the ball loose, and Vonn Bell recovered it for the Saints, returning it 6 yards to the Minnesota 37-yard line. New Orleans then drove to third-and-goal from the 4-yard line before Everson Griffen and Danielle Hunter's shared sack on Drew Brees forced them to settle for a 29-yard field goal by Wil Lutz, making the score 3–0. Minnesota struck back with an 11-play, 50-yard drive, including a 16-yard run on an end around by receiver Alexander Mattison, to tie the game on Dan Bailey's 43-yard field goal. Midway into the second quarter, New Orleans drove 70 yards in four plays, featuring a 50-yard completion from reserve quarterback Taysom Hill to Deonte Harris. Alvin Kamara gave the Saints a 10–3 lead with a 4-yard touchdown run on the next play. The Vikings responded, with Dalvin Cook rushing 4 times for 31 yards and catching a 22-yard pass on a 13-play, 72-yard drive that ended with Bailey's 21-yard field goal, making the score 10–6. On the third play of the Saints' next drive, safety Anthony Harris intercepted a pass from Brees and returned it 30 yards to the New Orleans 45-yard line. Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins went on to complete two passes to Thielen for gains of 19 and 13 yards as the team drove to a 13–10 lead on Cook's 5-yard touchdown run, with just 23 seconds left in the half. Deonte Harris returned the kickoff 54 yards to the Vikings' 45-yard line, which was followed with a 20-yard pass from Brees to Michael Thomas. Lutz attempted a 43-yard field goal, but this was missed to the right.\nAfter the first three drives of the third quarter ended in punts, Minnesota drove 54 yards in 8 plays, the longest being a 34-yard catch by Thielen. Cook finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to put the Vikings ahead 20–10. After a few more punts, New Orleans opened the fourth quarter with an eight-play, 85-yard drive in which Brees completed two 14-yard passes to tight end Jared Cook and a 18-yard pass to Ted Ginn Jr. before finding Hill in the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown, cutting their deficit to 20–17. After a punt, the Saints drove to the Vikings' 20-yard line, only to have Brees fumble the ball while being sacked by Hunter; this was recovered by defensive tackle Jalyn Holmes. After the Saints' defense forced the Vikings to punt after three plays, Brees completed five consecutive passes for 44 yards in the last 2 minutes to set up Lutz's 49-yard field goal, forcing overtime at 20–20. The Vikings took the opening kickoff in overtime and proceeded to drive 75 yards in 9 plays for the game winning score. After 3 carries for 20 yards by Cook and a 10-yard catch by Stefon Diggs, Cousins completed a 43-yard pass to Thielen, to move the ball to the Saints' 2-yard line. After losing two yards on a pair of carries by Cook, Cousins found Rudolph for a 4-yard touchdown pass to give the Vikings the victory, and record his first playoff win.\nFor the Vikings, Cousins completed 19 of 31 passes for 242 yards and a touchdown, and Cook rushed for 94 yards and two touchdowns, while also catching 3 passes for 36 yards. For the Saints, Brees finished the day 26-for-33 for 208 yards with a touchdown and an interception, while Deonte Harris had 227 total yards – a 50-yard reception, 133 yards from 3 kickoff returns and 44 yards from 4 punt returns. Hill became the first player to record at least 50 passing yards, 50 rushing yards and 25 receiving yards in a playoff game.\nNFC: Seattle Seahawks 17, Philadelphia Eagles 9.\nThe Eagles came into the game with five members of their practice squad from earlier in the season starting on offense, and they were unable to contain the Seahawks, especially after defensive end Jadeveon Clowney knocked Eagles starting quarterback Carson Wentz out of the game with a concussion in the first quarter. The Seahawks would go on to outgain the Eagles in yards 382–282, and hold on to win and advance to the Divisional round for the first time since 2016.\nSeattle got a scoring opportunity on their second drive after an unnecessary roughness penalty on Eagles defensive back Craig James for tackling the Seahawks' punt returner after a fair catch had been called. From their own 46-yard line, the Seahawks then drove to the Eagles' 17-yard line, but Jason Myers' 35-yard field goal attempt was blocked. The next time Seattle got the ball, they drove 51 yards in 10 plays, the longest being DK Metcalf's 24-yard reception; Myers finished the drive with a 49-yard field goal to give the team a 3–0 lead. In the second quarter, Eagles backup quarterback Josh McCown – replacing Wentz, who left the game in the first quarter with a head injury – led the team 64 yards in 13 plays to tie the score on a 46-yard field goal from Jake Elliott. On the next drive, Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson completed passes to Metcalf and David Moore for gains of 26 yards and 38 yards respectively, as the team drove 77 yards in 9 plays. On first and goal from the 5-yard line, Marshawn Lynch fought his way through multiple Eagles defenders, and muscled his way into the end zone, to give Seattle a 10–3 lead at halftime.\nPhiladelphia took the second half kickoff and drove 52 yards in seven plays, including McCown's 32-yard completion to tight end Zach Ertz, ultimately adding three points on Elliott's 26-yard field goal. On Seattle's next drive, Wilson completed a 20-yard pass to Lynch and followed it up with a 53-yard touchdown pass to Metcalf, giving Seattle a 17–6 lead. McCown responded by completing three passes for 49 yards and rushing for 4 yards, on a 55-yard drive that ended with Elliott's third field goal, that cut the Eagles' deficit to 17–9. The Eagles had two drives in the fourth quarter, both of which resulted in turnovers on downs: first they drove to the Seattle 24-yard line, only to lose the ball on a fourth down incompletion, and in the second instance, Jadeveon Clowney sacked McCown on fourth down, enabling Seattle's offense to run out the rest of the clock. Coincidentally, this game was a rematch between a regular season game between the two teams, and the Seahawks also won that game 17–9.\nWilson completed 18 of 30 passes for 325 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 45 yards. Metcalf caught seven passes for 160 yards – the most receiving yards by a rookie in a Super Bowl-era playoff game – and a touchdown. The Eagles had 282 yards of total offense, with McCown – who, at age 40, became the oldest quarterback to make his first appearance in an NFL playoff game – finishing 18-for-24 and passing for 174 yards.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 11, 2020.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 27, Minnesota Vikings 10.\nSan Francisco dominated the Vikings, massively outgaining them in time of possession (38:27–21:33), first downs (21–7), rushing yards (186–21) and total yards (308–147).\nAfter forcing Minnesota to punt on their opening drive, the 49ers drove 61 yards in eight plays, featuring a pair of completions from Jimmy Garoppolo to Emmanuel Sanders for gains of 22 and 11 yards – Sanders' only receptions of the game. Garoppolo, starting in the playoffs for the first time, ended the possession with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Kendrick Bourne that put the 49ers up 7–0. Minnesota responded by moving then ball 79 yards in seven plays to tie the score with Kirk Cousins' 41-yard touchdown completion to Stefon Diggs. In the second quarter, San Francisco took advantage of Richie James' 18-yard punt return that gave them a first down on the Vikings' 47-yard line. Moving the ball 53 yards in 10 plays, including an 18-yard catch by Deebo Samuel, the team took a 14–7 lead on a 1-yard touchdown run by Tevin Coleman. Following a Minnesota punt, Garoppolo threw a pass that was intercepted by linebacker Eric Kendricks, who returned it 4 yards to the 49ers' 29-yard line. This set up Dan Bailey's 29-yard field goal with 31 seconds left on the clock, making the score 14–10 at halftime.\nOn the second half kickoff, Vikings defender Mike Boone was flagged for unnecessary roughness while tackling James, turning James' 22-yard return into a 37-yard gain on the 49ers' 37-yard line. From there, San Francisco drove 46 yards, including a 21-yard catch by Bourne, to take a 17–10 lead on Robbie Gould's 35-yard field goal. Then on the third play of the Vikings' next drive, cornerback Richard Sherman intercepted Cousins and returned the ball 13 yards, giving San Francisco the ball on the Vikings' 44-yard line. Coleman went on to carry the ball on six of the next eight plays, picking up 36 of the drive's 44 yards, on the way to a 2-yard touchdown run that gave the 49ers a 24–10 lead. Later in the quarter, Vikings cornerback Marcus Sherels muffed Mitch Wishnowsky's 54-yard punt and Raheem Mostert recovered for San Francisco on the Vikings' 10-yard line. Three plays later, Gould's 21-yard field goal increased the 49ers' lead to 27–10, with less than a minute left in the third quarter. This turned out to be the last score of the game, as the Vikings' last 4 drives would result in two punts and two turnovers on downs.\nColeman was the top offensive performer for San Francisco, with 22 carries for 105 yards and two touchdowns. 49ers rookie lineman Nick Bosa had 6 tackles and 2 sacks in his playoff debut. Vikings running back Dalvin Cook, who rushed for 1,135 yards during the season, was held to just 18 yards on 9 carries. Minnesota running back Ameer Abdullah had 5 kickoff returns for 148 yards.\nAFC: Tennessee Titans 28, Baltimore Ravens 12.\nTennessee stunned the heavily favored Ravens, who had the NFL's best record and had finished the year as the league's top scoring team, while also setting a new record for rushing yards in a season. Once again, Titans running back Derrick Henry accounted for most of the Tennessee offense, accounting for 205 of their 300 total yards. Meanwhile, Baltimore racked up 530 yards, but their three turnovers and four failed fourth-down conversion attempts proved too much to overcome. As a result, Baltimore became the first number 1 seed in the playoffs to lose to the number 6 seed since the New England Patriots lost to the New York Jets in 2011.\nOn the Ravens' first drive of the game, Lamar Jackson threw a pass that bounced off the hands of Mark Andrews and was intercepted by safety Kevin Byard, who returned it 31 yards, with an unnecessary roughness penalty against Jackson for a horse-collar tackle adding another 15 yards and giving Tennessee a first down on the Ravens' 35-yard line. Henry then carried the ball 4 times for 22 yards on an 8-play drive that ended with Ryan Tannehill's 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jonnu Smith, who made a leaping one-handed catch in the back of the end zone. After getting the ball back, Baltimore drove to a fourth-and-1 on their own 45-yard line. Jackson attempted to convert with a quarterback sneak, but he was tackled by linebacker David Long Jr. for no gain on the last play of the first quarter. On the next play, Tannehill gave the team a 14–0 lead with a 45-yard touchdown pass to Kalif Raymond. Following a punt from each team, Jackson completed a 30-yard pass to Marquise Brown and a 16-yard pass to Andrews, setting up Justin Tucker's 49-yard field goal to make the score 14–3. Then after a Titans punt, Jackson completed a 26-yard pass to Seth Roberts, as well as two completions to Brown for gains of 16 yards and 38 yards on a 91-yard drive. Tucker finished it off with a 22-yard field goal as time expired in the half, making the score 14–6 at halftime.\nBaltimore took the second half kickoff and drove to a fourth-and-1 on the Titans' 18-yard line. Jackson again tried to convert with a run, but was stopped for no gain by linebacker Harold Landry. Two plays later on third-and-1, Henry took a handoff through the middle and ran for a 66-yard gain, to the Ravens' 6-yard line. Then when faced with third-and-goal from the 3-yard line, Henry took a direct snap out of wildcat formation and threw a jump pass to Corey Davis for a touchdown. This gave Tennessee a 21–6 lead and made Henry the first running back to throw a touchdown pass in the postseason since Allen Rice in the 1987 season. On the first play of the Ravens' next possession, defensive end Jurrell Casey forced a fumble while sacking Jackson, which Jeffery Simmons recovered for Tennessee on the Baltimore 20-yard line. From there, the Titans drove to a 28–6 lead, scoring on a 6-play drive that ended with Tannehill's 1-yard touchdown run. Baltimore responded with a drive to the Titans' 36-yard line, only to lose the ball again with a Jackson pass that was intercepted by safety Kenny Vaccaro. After forcing Tennessee to punt, the Ravens finally managed to score a touchdown, moving the ball 83 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 27-yard run by Jackson. Jackson finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Hayden Hurst, but his subsequent two-point conversion pass was incomplete, keeping the score at 28–12. Tennessee's defense then pinned down Baltimore for the rest of the game, forcing a turnover on downs on the Ravens' final two possessions.\nHenry finished the game with 30 carries for 195 yards, while also catching two passes for 7 yards and throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass. He became the first player to rush for over 180 yards twice in the same postseason. Tannehill completed 7 of 14 pass attempts for 88 yards, and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 13 yards and a touchdown; Casey had four tackles, two sacks and a forced fumble. Jackson completed 31 of 59 passes for 365 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions, while also rushing 20 times for 143 yards. This made him the first quarterback to throw for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in a playoff game. His top receiver was Brown, who caught seven passes for 126 yards.\nSunday, January 12, 2020.\nOn May 22, 2019, the league announced that the divisional round games played on the Sunday would be moved from their traditional 1:00 p.m. (ET) and 4:30 p.m. (ET) start times to 3:00 p.m. (ET) and 6:30 p.m. (ET), respectively. Similar to the 2002 changes made to the start times of the Conference championship games, this would allow teams in the Mountain and Pacific time zones to play in the early Sunday game at a reasonable hour instead of at 11:00 a.m. or 10:00 a.m. local time.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 51, Houston Texans 31.\nAfter falling behind 24–0, Kansas City came back with an NFL playoff record seven consecutive touchdowns and a field goal over their next eight drives, including a run of 28 points in the final 10 minutes of the second quarter.\nOn the opening possession, Houston mounted a six-play, 75-yard drive that culminated in Deshaun Watson's 54-yard touchdown pass to Kenny Stills on third-and-1, giving the Texans an early 7–0 lead. The Chiefs then went three-and-out on their first drive, with tight end Travis Kelce dropping a potential first down pass on third down. Dustin Colquitt's ensuing punt was blocked by Barkevious Mingo and recovered by Lonnie Johnson Jr., who returned it 10 yards for a touchdown that put the Texans up 14–0 less than five minutes into the game.\nAfter both teams punted on their next drives, Chiefs returner Tyreek Hill muffed the ball inside his own 10-yard line which was recovered by Keion Crossen for Houston. Two plays later, Watson found tight end Darren Fells in the end zone for a 4-yard touchdown and a 21–0 lead late in the first quarter.\nThe next time Houston got the ball, they drove 48 yards in nine plays to a fourth-and-inches on the Chiefs 13-yard line. The Texans lined up to go for it. However, after having to call a timeout with the play clock running down, Texans coach Bill O'Brien changed his mind because he did not like their play call. So, rather than risk a potential turnover on downs, the Texans settled for Ka'imi Fairbairn's 31-yard field goal to go up by 24 at the 10:54 mark of the second quarter. This would be the extent of their success, as the Chiefs went from being down 0-24 as late as 10:05 remaining in the 2nd quarter, to trailing 14–24 at the 8:05 mark, then 21–24 at 6:31, and finally taking the lead 28–24 at 0:44 remaining in the first half. The scoring would go on to be 51–7 in favor of the Chiefs from that 10:54 point in the 2nd quarter. First, Mecole Hardman returned the ensuing kickoff 58 yards to Houston's 42-yard line. Patrick Mahomes then threw a 25-yard pass to Kelce to get in the red zone before hitting running back Damien Williams for a 17-yard touchdown. After Houston went three-and-out on their next drive, they attempted a fake punt on fourth-and-4 with a direct snap to Justin Reid who was tackled by Daniel Sorensen two yards short, giving Kansas City the ball at the Texans 33. Johnson was then called for pass interference to put the ball at the five before Mahomes hit Kelce in the end zone to cut the deficit to 10. On the ensuing kickoff, DeAndre Carter fumbled the ball due to a hit by Sorenson, and it went right into the arms of Kansas City's Darwin Thompson, who returned it to the Houston 6-yard line. Mahomes then threw his third touchdown pass in less than four minutes, and his second to Kelce, to make the score 24–21.\nTaking possession at their own 10 with 2:47 left in the quarter, the Chiefs went on a 90-yard drive that included another pass interference on Johnson, while Mahomes rushed twice for 35 yards and completed a pair of 20-yard passes to Hill and Kelce. Finally, with 44 seconds left in the half, Mahomes threw another five-yard touchdown to Kelce to give the Chiefs their first lead of the game, 28–24. Mahomes' four touchdown passes in the second quarter tied an NFL postseason record set by Doug Williams in Super Bowl XXII. Fairbairn missed a 51-yard field goal as time expired in the half as the Chiefs became the first team in NFL history to fall behind by as many as 20 points in the first half but still lead at halftime.\nThe Chiefs would extend their lead on the opening possession of the third quarter, going 85 yards in seven plays, the longest a 48-yard catch by Sammy Watkins. Williams ran the ball in from the goal-line, increasing their lead to 34–24 after Harrison Butker missed the extra point. After forcing another Texans punt, the Chiefs took advantage of another pass interference penalty against Houston and a 28-yard completion from Mahomes to Kelce, scoring on their sixth straight possession with another Williams touchdown run to give them a 41–24 lead with 4:39 left in the quarter. Houston finally snapped Kansas City's 41-point run when Watson completed 4 passes for 80 yards and finished the drive with a 5-yard touchdown run, making the score 41–31 with 24 seconds left in the third quarter.\nKansas City would make it seven touchdowns in a row, setting a new postseason record, on a drive that included a 23-yard pass to Kelce and a 28-yard completion to Watkins, putting the ball at the Houston 8. Mahomes then found Blake Bell in the end zone, making the score 48–31. On Houston's next drive, they turned the ball over on downs at the Chiefs 42. A pair of runs by Williams for gains of 11 and 26 yard to set up Butker's 24-yard field goal with 8:06 left to put Kansas City up by 20. Houston then turned the ball over on downs on their final two possessions, the last coming when Frank Clark sacked Watson for a 17-yard loss on fourth-and-8 from the Kansas City 8-yard line.\nMahomes finished the game 23/35 for 321 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. He was also the leading rusher with 53 yards on seven carries. Kelce had 10 catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns, tying a Super Bowl-era postseason record. Hardman had six kickoff returns for 142 yards. Williams rushed for 47 yards, caught two passes for 21 yards, and scored three touchdowns. Watson threw for 388 yards and two touchdowns, while DeAndre Hopkins had 118 yards on nine catches. Kansas City's 24-point comeback was the fourth largest in postseason history.\nNFC: Green Bay Packers 28, Seattle Seahawks 23.\nDespite being nearly even in total yards (375–344) and both sides avoiding turnovers, the Packers built a 21–3 halftime lead and withstood a Seattle second-half comeback to earn their fourth trip to the NFC title game under quarterback Aaron Rodgers.\nGreen Bay got the ball first and on their first play, Aaron Jones ran for a 23-yard gain to the Packers 48-yard line, beginning a drive that culminated with a 20-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to Davante Adams. Later in the quarter, Seattle receiver David Moore's 10-yard punt return gave the Seahawks a first down on their own 42. Russell Wilson's subsequent 28-yard completion to Tyler Lockett set up a 45-yard field goal by Jason Myers that made the score 7–3.\nRodgers then completed 4/5 passes for 52 yards on a nine-play, 75-yard drive. Jones finished it off with a 1-yard touchdown run to give Green Bay a 14–3 lead in the second quarter. Then, after Myers missed a 50-yard field goal attempt, the Packers got the ball on their own 40. Receiver Tyler Ervin opened the drive with an 18-yard run on an end around play. Nine plays later, Jones finished the drive with his second 1-yard touchdown run, increasing Green Bay's lead to 21–3 with 1:30 left in the half.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Wilson ran for a 24-yard gain and completed a 24-yard pass to DK Metcalf as the Seahawks drove 69 yards in 10 plays to score on Marshawn Lynch's 1-yard touchdown run, cutting their deficit to 21–10. However, Green Bay stormed right back in just five plays, as Rodgers completed a 27-yard pass to tight end Jimmy Graham before throwing the ball to Adams for a 40-yard score, putting them back up at 28–10. Seattle responded with Wilson completing 5/6 passes for 48 yards and rushing four times for 26 on the way to a 28–17 score on his 7-yard touchdown pass to Lockett with 39 seconds left in the quarter.\nAfter a Green Bay punt, Wilson completed four consecutive passes for 68 yards on the way to a 1-yard touchdown run by Lynch, making the score 28–23 after a failed two-point conversion try. But the next time they got the ball, Seattle had to punt with 2:41 left on the clock. Green Bay was able to run out the time with their ensuing possession, picking up two key first downs on third down completions. When faced with third-and-8 after two plays, Rodgers completed a 32-yard pass to Adams. Then when faced with third-and-9, Rodgers' 9-yard pass to Graham picked a first down that enabled the team to run out the rest of the clock.\nRodgers completed 16/27 passes for 243 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 14 yards. Adams caught eight passes for 160 yards and two scores. Green Bay defensive ends Za'Darius Smith and Preston Smith each had two sacks. Wilson finished the day 21/31 for 277 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 64 yards. Lockett was his top target, with nine receptions for 136 yards and a score.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 19, 2020.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 35, Tennessee Titans 24.\nThis was the first AFC Championship game since not to feature the New England Patriots. It was also the first AFC Championship game since , and only the third of the 21st century, not to feature Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, or Ben Roethlisberger as a starting quarterback.\nFor the second week in a row, Kansas City came back from a deficit to defeat a team that had beaten them in the regular season, this time recovering from an early 10–0 hole to earn their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years. The Chiefs outgained Tennessee in total yards 404–295, while holding their explosive running back Derrick Henry to just 61 yards from scrimmage, with negative yardage in the second half.\nTennessee took the opening kickoff and converted Ryan Tannehill's 37-yard completion to A. J. Brown into a 30-yard field goal by Greg Joseph. Kansas City went three-and-out on their first drive, and Kalif Raymond returned their punt 9 yards to the Titans 42-yard line. Tennessee then drove 58 yards in 9 plays, including a 3-yard catch by Adam Humphries on fourth-and-2. On the next play, Tannehill completed a 22-yard pass to Jonnu Smith on the Chiefs 4-yard line. Then Henry took a snap from wildcat formation and ran into the end zone for a 4-yard score, giving Tennessee a 10–0 lead. This time the Chiefs were able to respond, driving 69 yards in 10 plays, the longest a 26-yard completion from Patrick Mahomes to Tyreek Hill. Hill's 8-yard touchdown catch on the last play made the score 10–7 with 51 seconds left in the first quarter.\nThe Titans struck back with a 15-play, 74-yard drive that took 9:07 off the clock. Tannehill finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass to offensive tackle Dennis Kelly on a tackle-eligible play that put the team back up by 10 points. Mecole Hardman returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to his own 35-yard line. From there, Kansas City drove 65 yards in 5 plays, the longest a 24-yard completion from Mahomes to Demarcus Robinson. On the last play, Mahomes threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Hill, cutting their deficit to 17–14. Then after a punt, Mahomes completed 4 passes for 41 yards and rushed for 7 before taking off for a 27-yard touchdown run in which he evaded five Titans players on the way to the end zone. This gave the Chiefs a 21–17 lead with 23 seconds left in the half.\nAfter a pair of punts to start the second half, Kansas City drove 73 yards in 13 plays to go up 28–17 on Damien Williams' 3-yard touchdown run. On their next drive, the Chiefs put the game completely out of reach with Mahomes' 60-yard touchdown pass to Sammy Watkins, giving them a 35–17 lead with 7:44 left on the clock. Tennessee responded by driving 80 yards in 8 plays, including a fake punt in which punter Brett Kern threw a 28-yard pass to Amani Hooker. Tannehill finished the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Firkser, making the final score 35–24, and sending the Chiefs to the Super Bowl for the first time since 1970.\nMahomes completed 23/35 passes for 294 yards and three touchdowns, while also leading Kansas City in rushing with eight carries for 53 yards and a score. Watkins caught seven passes for 114 yards and a touchdown. Tannehill completed 21/31 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 11 yards.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 37, Green Bay Packers 20.\nSan Francisco lost starting running back Tevin Coleman to injury for most of the game, but this proved to be a non-issue as Raheem Mostert ran wild over the Packers with a franchise record 220 rushing yards and four touchdowns, both the second highest totals in NFL postseason history.\nOn the 49ers second possession of the game, Jimmy Garoppolo completed a pair of passes to Deebo Samuel for gains of 16 and 30 yards before Mostert stormed into the end zone on a 36-yard touchdown run. Green Bay was soon forced to punt, and Richie James returned it 26 yards to the San Francisco 49-yard line, setting up Robbie Gould's 54-yard field goal to give the team a 10–0 lead.\nIn the second quarter, a sack by K'Waun Williams forced a fumble. Green Bay recovered the ball, but lost 10 yards and had to punt from their own 14. J. K. Scott's 23-yard kick gave the 49ers great field position on the Packers 37. San Francisco then drove 37 yards in 6 plays to take a 17–0 lead on Mostert's 9-yard touchdown run. The Packers responded with a drive to the 49ers 25-yard line, only to lose the ball when quarterback Aaron Rodgers fumbled a snap, which was recovered by San Francisco lineman DeForest Buckner. The 49ers went on to drive 60 yards in 8 plays, including a 34-yard burst from Mostert. Gould finished the drive with a 27-yard field goal, increasing the team's lead to 20–0 after the two minute warning. Then Rodgers threw a pass that was intercepted by Emmanuel Moseley, who returned it 9 yards to the Green Bay 30-yard line. Mostert then took the ball to the end zone with three straight carries, the last an 18-yard touchdown run that gave San Francisco a 27–0 lead with 16 seconds left in the second quarter.\nGreen Bay managed to cut the score to 27–7 on the opening drive of the second half, moving the ball 80 yards in 11 plays. Rogers completed 9/10 passes for 75 yards on the drive, the last a 9-yard touchdown throw to Aaron Jones. But the 49ers stormed right back, with a pair of runs by Samuel for gains of 11 and 32 yards aiding a seven-play, 79-yard drive that ended on Mostert's 22-yard touchdown run. This gave the 49ers a 34–7 lead with five minutes left in the third quarter. Green Bay responded by going 80 yards in 10 plays, including Rodgers' 4-yard pass to Allen Lazard on fourth-and-2, and a 42-yard completion from Rodgers to tight end Jimmy Graham. On the next play, Jones ran for a touchdown that made the score 34–13 after a failed two-point conversion attempt. Then after a punt, Rodgers completed a 65-yard pass to Davante Adams on the 49ers 22-yard line. Three plays later, his 8-yard touchdown pass to Jace Sternberger made the score 34–20 with just under six minutes left in the game. However, San Francisco crushed any hope of a comeback with their ensuing 10-play, 44-yard drive, starting with Garoppolo's 19-yard completion to George Kittle. Gould completed the scoring with a 42-yard field goal to put the 49ers up 37–20 with 3:36 to play, before Richard Sherman intercepted a pass from Rodgers that enabled San Francisco to run out the rest of the clock and earn the franchise's seventh trip to the Super Bowl.\nMostert had 29 carries for 220 yards and four touchdowns, along with two receptions for 9 yards. Garoppolo set an NFC championship record for fewest pass attempts, completing 6/8 passes for 77 yards. Williams had seven solo tackles and a sack. Rodgers completed 31/39 passes for 326 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Adams had nine receptions for 138 yards. With the 49ers defeating the Packers, a potentially anticipated rematch of Super Bowl I was prevented.\nSuper Bowl LIV: Kansas City Chiefs 31, San Francisco 49ers 20.\nThis was the first time the Chiefs and 49ers have faced each other in the Super Bowl. Their last regular season meeting ended in a 38–27 Chiefs victory at Arrowhead Stadium on September 23, 2018. The 49ers led the all-time series 7–6.\nThe teams traded a touchdown and a field goal in the first half, going into halftime tied 10–10. The 49ers took a 10-point lead in the third quarter. The Chiefs then went on to score 21 unanswered points in the final 7 minutes to win the Super Bowl 31–20.\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games are televised nationally on network television.\nESPN produced coverage of the Saturday afternoon Wild Card game for the sixth consecutive season, and ESPN simulcasted it on ABC for the fifth consecutive season.

        "title": "2018 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2018 Major League Baseball season began on March 29. The regular season ended on October 1, extended a day for tiebreaker games to decide the winners of the National League Central and National League West. The postseason began on October 2. The World Series began on October 23, and ended on October 28 with the Boston Red Sox defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games to win their ninth World Series championship.\nThe 89th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 17 at Nationals Park, the home of the Washington Nationals. The American League won, 8–6, in 10 innings.\nThis was also the last season for the August trade waivers.\nSchedule.\nAs has been the case since 2013, all teams played their four division opponents 19 times each for a total of 76 games. They played six or seven games against each of the other ten same-league opponents for a total of 66 games, and 20 interleague games. The primary interleague match-ups were AL East vs NL East, AL Central vs NL Central, and AL West vs NL West. Since \"natural rivalry\" matchups were part of the three-year divisional rotation, the schedule format for interleague games was different from previous years. The 20 interleague games each team played two three-game series (one home, one away) against its natural rival (total of six games), two two-game series (one home, one away) against each team for two other opponents (total of eight games), and a single three-game series against each team for the last two (one home, one away; total of six games).\nUnder the new collective bargaining agreement reached in December 2016, the regular season was extended to 187 days in order to add four additional off-days for all teams. All teams were scheduled to play Opening Day, March 29—the earliest domestic start of a regular season in league history until the 2019 season. The Sunday night game before the All-Star Game was replaced by a single, nationally televised game on the Thursday after the All-Star Game (which for 2018, was played between the St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs), before all other teams returned from break the next day.\nThe Minnesota Twins and the Cleveland Indians played a two-game series at Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on April 17 and 18, while the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres played a three-game series at Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey in Monterrey, Mexico, from May 4 to 6. The 2018 MLB Little League Classic at BB&amp;T Ballpark in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, coinciding with the Little League World Series, returned to the schedule. It was played between the Philadelphia Phillies and the New York Mets on August 19.\nRule changes.\nBeginning in the 2018 season, MLB implemented new pace of play rules, which include limiting the number of mound visits for each team to six per nine innings. Teams will receive an additional visit for every extra inning played.\nUniforms.\nWholesale changes.\nThe Detroit Tigers modified the Olde English 'D' on the home jersey to match the 'D' on the cap. Other than a one-season hiatus of 'D' usage in 1960, this is the first major change to the Tigers' home jersey since 1934.\nThe Cleveland Indians have confirmed this will be the final season using the Chief Wahoo logo on its uniforms. It will be replaced at the start of the 2019 season. The team wore a Wahoo-less uniform through their September 6–9 series with the Blue Jays, as the team had been sued unsuccessfully by a group in Ontario in October 2016 to prevent the team from donning the logo during Toronto home games through the 2016 ALCS.\nAlternate changes.\nThe Oakland Athletics added a kelly green alternate jersey to commemorate the franchise's 50th anniversary in Oakland. The uniforms are used during every Friday home game.\nThe Washington Nationals added a second navy blue jersey to commemorate the team's hosting of the 2018 All-Star Game. The uniform features the script \"Nationals\" in white with red trim and numerals in red with white trim.\nBoth the Cincinnati Reds and the Pittsburgh Pirates replaced their camouflage uniforms with new white alternate jerseys featuring olive and military green logos, letters and numbers.\nAnniversaries and special events.\nThe following teams will wear commemorative patches for special occasions:\nOther uniforms.\nAs is the custom for the reigning World Series champions, the Astros wore gold-lettered uniforms at their home opener April 2 and 3.\nPlayers, managers and coaches wore No. 42 on April 15, the 71st anniversary of Jackie Robinson's debut in the majors.\nThe Orioles wore special caps and green uniforms on April 22, Earth Day.\nThe Reds and Diamondbacks wore Spanish language \"Los Rojos\" and \"Los D-backs\" uniforms May 5, Cinco de Mayo. The Diamondbacks wore them again September 8. The Reds wore them again September 28.\nThe Royals wore an alternate uniform with a crown atop the R, and a cap with a crown instead of the \"KC\", on June 30 in Seattle.\nThe Blue Jays wore red uniforms on July 1, Canada Day. They wore a cap with a gold maple leaf, as well.\nAll US-based teams wore Stars and Stripes caps and uniforms from July 2–4, ending with Independence Day. Teams wore caps denoting what league they play for (there were nine interleague series during the time period).\nFor the second straight year, MLB sponsored Players Weekend, an event for which all teams wore special uniforms with design cues reminiscent of typical Little League uniforms. The event was held August 24 to 26, again coinciding with the final weekend of the Little League World Series.\nThe Royals wore Spanish-language \"Los Reales\" uniforms September 1.\nThe Orioles wore Braille uniforms September 18 to mark the 40th anniversary of the National Federation of the Blind's headquarters moving to Baltimore. They became the first pro sports team ever to wear such uniforms. The uniforms had the name \"Orioles\" in Braille, and the players' last names were in Braille.\nThrowbacks.\nThe Phillies will wear their 1980s powder blue uniforms for select Thursday home games.\nThe Athletics and White Sox wore 1968 throwbacks April 17 to mark the 50th anniversary of the Athletics' first season in Oakland.\nThe Tigers and Royals wore Negro leagues throwbacks May 6. The Tigers wore the uniforms of the Detroit Stars, and the Royals wore the uniforms of the Kansas City Monarchs.\nThe Padres wore 1998 throwbacks May 12 to mark the 20th anniversary of their 1998 NL title. They will wear them again at select Wednesday games.\nThe Royals wore 1969 throwbacks May 19 to mark the franchise's 50th season. The uniforms also had the MLB 100th anniversary patch, which all teams wore that season.\nThe White Sox and Brewers wore 1980s throwbacks June 2 and 3.\nThe Marlins wore 1993 throwbacks June 8 to 10 to mark their 25th anniversary.\nThe Braves wore 1974 throwbacks June 22 and 23 to celebrate Hank Aaron Heritage Weekend.\nThe Mariners marked the 20th anniversary of their 1998 \"Turn Ahead the Clock\" promotion by wearing the uniforms from that game June 30 against Kansas City.\nThe Brewers and Pirates wore Negro league throwbacks July 13. The Brewers wore the uniforms of the Milwaukee Bears, and the Pirates wore the uniforms of the Pittsburgh Crawfords.\nThe Brewers wore Milwaukee Bears uniforms August 2. Their opponents, the Rockies, wore their regular uniforms.\nThe Mariners and Astros wore throwbacks on August 10; the Mariners wore their 1979 throwbacks, and the Astros wore their \"Tequila Sunrise\" uniforms.\nThe Angels wore California Angels throwbacks from 1976 to 1985 on August 27.\nThe Rays wore their 1998 inaugural throwbacks on March 31 against the Boston Red Sox, on June 9 against the Seattle Mariners, and on June 23 against the New York Yankees, along with September 8 against the Baltimore Orioles.\nThe Tigers wore their 1968 road uniforms September 8 at home to mark the 50th anniversary of their winning the 1968 World Series title.\nBroadcast rights.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis was the fifth year of the current eight-year deals with Fox Sports, ESPN and TBS. Fox aired eight weeks of baseball on Saturday Nights leading up to the 2018 Major League Baseball All-Star Game which also aired on Fox. Fox also televised Saturday afternoon games for the last four weeks of the regular season. FS1 televised games on Tuesday and on Saturdays both during the afternoon and night. ESPN televised games on its flagship telecast \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as Monday and Wednesday Nights. TBS televised Sunday afternoon games for the last 13 weeks of the regular season.

ESPN televised the National League Wild Card, along with the National League West and Central tie-breaker games. FS1 and MLB Network televised the National League Division Series. Fox and FS1 will televise the National League Championship Series. The World Series aired exclusively on Fox for the 19th consecutive year.\nLocal.\nOn September 6, Fox Sports Detroit suspended Detroit Tigers play-by-play announcer Mario Impemba and color commentator Rod Allen for the remainder of the season after an alleged physical altercation that occurred on September 4, in which Allen reportedly placed Impemba in a choke hold at Chicago's Guaranteed Rate Field after a game they called between the Tigers and the Chicago White Sox, a claim Allen's agent has denied. Backup announcers Matt Shepard and Kirk Gibson replaced them for the rest of the season. It was later announced that Impemba and Allen's contracts were not renewed for future seasons, ending their 17 years together as broadcast partners.\nDigital.\nNine regular season games were broadcast exclusively in the United States on Facebook Watch, beginning with the April 4 game between the New York Mets and Philadelphia Phillies."

        "text": "The following is about the qualification rules and the quota allocation for the alpine skiing events at the 2018 Winter Olympics.\nQualification rules.\nQuotas.\nA maximum of 320 athletes are allowed to compete at the Olympic Games. A maximum of 22 athletes per nation will be allowed to compete with a maximum of 14 males or 14 females from a nation being permitted. Each nation may also enter a maximum of one team in the team event.\nA standard.\nThe A standard entails a competitor to be ranked within the top 500 in any event on the FIS Points list which will be made public after qualification ends on January 21, 2018. The qualification period began on July 1, 2017.\nB standard.\nNational Olympic committees (NOC) without athletes meeting the A standard can enter one competitor of each sex (known as the basic quota) in only the slalom and/or giant slalom events. These athletes must have only a maximum of 140 FIS points on the FIS Points list on 21 January 2018.\nThe Points List is calculated by taking the average of five event results for technical events (giant slalom and slalom) and three events for speed events (downhill, super G, and super combined).\nAllocation of quotas.\nEvery NOC will be assigned one male and one female quota spot meeting the B standard.\nThe host nation (South Korea) is awarded an additional quota per gender, granted all athletes meet the standard above.\nEvery NOC with at least one male and/or female in the top 30 of any event will be allocated one additional male and/or female quota in addition to the basic quota. If an athlete is ranked in the top 30 in more than one event a second additional quota for that sex will be given or if two different athletes are in the top 30.\nThe remaining quotas will be assigned using the Olympic Quota allocation list on 22 January 2018. The spots will be assigned until a maximum of 320 quotas are reached including the above. When a nation reaches its maximum, remaining athletes from that country will be skipped over. The list is a table of athletes in the top 500 in their two best events (including both male and female athletes). These additional quotas can be used to enter either male or female.\nAn athlete can be counted only once for the above criteria. For example, if a country has only one athlete meeting all three criteria then only one quota will be given (not 3).\nThe top 16 nations in the overall FIS World Cup Nations standings as of 22 January 2018 will ber permitted to enter a team of two male and two female athletes in the mixed team event. If South Korea is not among the top 16, then the top 15 along with South Korea will qualify. In the event one of these nations have only 3 quota spots earned above then they will be awarded a fourth quota to allow them to participate in the team event. It is unknown if these quotas are in addition to the 320 above.\nAllocation.\nThe following is the quota allocation as of 28 January 2018.\nNext eligible NOC.\nIn total 29 quotas have been made available for reallocation, 1 one of which was given to Hungary to compete in the team event. The following are the next eligible NOC's with those entries removed who either have already returned quotas, or are at the maximum (22) as of 24 January 2018. Bold indicates the acceptance of a quota, while a strike through indicates refusal."

If an athlete achieves the standard and does not finish in the top two or receives an invite from the IAAF, selection to the team was up to the sole discretion of the National Team Committee.

These athletes also had to meet the qualification time/points total to be selected.

        "text": "The 1939 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain and France was a scheduled tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team of Europe between September and December 1939. After arriving in the United Kingdom in August 1939, the tour was abandoned after one match had been played due to the outbreak of the Second World War.\nInvitation.\nIn October 1938 the British Rugby Football League (RFL) invited the New Zealand Rugby League to send a team to tour Britain during the latter part of 1939. The RFL also suggested that the side visit France as well and offered to help with arrangements for the French leg. At a special meeting of the New Zealand League Council in November 1938 both offers were accepted.\nSquad.\nAfter trial games a squad of 26 players (14 backs and 12 forwards) was finalised on 13 July 1939. \nJ.A. Redwood (chairman of the New Zealand Rugby League) and G. Grey Campbell (chairman of the Auckland Rugby League) were named as the co-managers of the team but Grey Campbell later withdrew due to ill-health and was replaced by R. Doble, also of the Auckland Rugby League. Canterbury forward Rex King was named captain of the team.\nTour.\nThe squad sailed from Wellington on 27 July 1939 onboard the RMS \"Rangitiki\" and arrived in London on 29 August 1939. Arriving at the Beechwood Hotel, Harrogate – the squad's base for the tour – on 31 August the team tried to maintain a normal attitude even in the face of the deteriorating political situation around them but acknowledged that the situation was liable to change at any time and in an interview, Doble volunteered the services of the team to help with air raid precautions in the Harrogate area. The first game of the tour took place as planned on 2 September as the tourists beat St Helens 19–3 in front of a crowd of 5,000 at Knowsley Road, but the declaration of war by Britain against Germany the following morning meant a review of the tour's viability.\nAn emergency meeting of the RFL tour sub-committee attended by the New Zealand managers on 5 September concluded that no further matches were possible and \"the only course was to endeavour to arrange for the return of the party to New Zealand at the earliest possible moment\". With the tour officially abandoned the remaining fixtures were all cancelled but while awaiting a ship home permission was given for the game against Dewsbury to take place on 9 September. Despite being announced at short notice the game was watched by 6,200 and the tourists won 22–10 to end the tour with a 100% winning record. Through the intervention of the New Zealand High Commissioner in London, Bill Jordan, the team were able to return to New Zealand on-board the \"Rangitiki\" – the same ship they had arrived on and arrived back in Auckland in late October.\nThe New Zealand Rugby League established that the curtailment of the tour had led to a net loss of £3,827 to the League.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of games in Britain was agreed in June 1939 and the French fixtures were to be arranged while the British part of the tour was in progress. Had the tour continued there would have been 21 games against English club sides, representative matches against Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumberland, a test match against Wales and a three-test series against Great Britain."

It is developed and published by Riot Games and was first released in 2009.\nProfessional tournaments began in 2011 with the Season 1 World Championship at DreamHack in Jönköping, Sweden. The latest major tournament was the 2023 League of Legends World Championship.\nTournaments.\n\"League of Legends\" is one of the largest esports with various annual tournaments taking place worldwide. In terms of esports professional gaming as of June 2016, \"League of Legends\" has had $29,203,916 USD in prize money, 4,083 Players, and 1,718 tournaments, compared to \"Dota 2's\" US$64,397,286 of prize money, 1,495 players, and 613 tournaments.\nWorld Championship.\nSeasons 1–3.\nThe was held at DreamHack in Sweden in June 2011 and had US$100,000 in prizes. The European team Fnatic defeated teams from Europe, the US, and Southeast Asia to win the tournament and received US$50,000 in prize money. Over 1.6 million viewers watched the streamed broadcast of the event, with a peak of over 210,000 simultaneous viewers in one semi-final match. After Season 1, Riot announced that US$5,000,000 would be paid out over Season 2. Of this amount, $2 million was to go to Riot's partners, including the IPL and other major esports associations. Another $2 million was to go to Riot's Season 2 qualifiers and championship. The final $1 million was to go to small organizers who apply to Riot to host \"League of Legends\" tournaments.\nAfter a series of network issues during the Season 2 World Playoffs that led to several matches being delayed, Riot revealed on October 13, 2012, that a special LAN-based client had been quickly developed, designed for use in tournament environments where the effects of lag and other network issues can be detrimental to the proper organization of an event. The LAN client was deployed for the first time during the first quarter-final and semi-final matches played following the rescheduled matches, and was in use during the finals. On October 13, 2012, the Taipei Assassins (TPA) of Taiwan triumphed over Azubu Frost of South Korea in the Finals of with a score of 3 to 1, and claimed the $1 million in prize money.\nIn October 2013, Korean team SK Telecom T1 and Chinese team Royal Club competed at the at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. SK Telecom T1 won the grand prize of $1 million, and Royal Club received $250,000.\nOn July 11, 2013, Riot Games announced that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services recognized \"League of Legends\" pro-players as professional athletes and that the P visa application process would be more simplified for them. These changes allowed professional players to stay in the United States for up to five years. Despite these reforms, there have still been a number of visa problems that have occurred for players in the LCS and other \"LoL\" tournaments entering the United States.\n2014–2016.\nSilversmith Thomas Lyte was asked to craft the winner trophy for the 2014 games, having already created the Season Two World Championship Cup in 2012. Riot Games, which owns League of Legends, commissioned the Summoner's Cup and specified that it should weigh 70 pounds. However, the weight was later reduced as it was too heavy to be lifted in victory.\nThe 2013 tournament had a grand prize of $1 million and attracted 32 million viewers online. The 2014 and 2015 tournaments each gave out one of the largest total prize pools in esports history, at $2.3 million. The 2016 World Championship's total prize pool was over $5 million, with over $2 million going over to the winner of the tournament. In October 2015, SK Telecom T1 became the first-ever two-time World Champion when they defeated fellow Korean team KOO Tigers with a score of 3 to 1 in the best-of-five finals in Berlin, Germany. SK Telecom T1 repeated their feat in October 2016, defeating fellow Korean team Samsung Galaxy 3–2 in the 2016 World Championship. The 2016 tournament was also notable for introducing \"Fan contributions\" to the prize pool; a certain percentage of purchases from Riot's store over the preceding months of the tournament went to increasing the prizes for the 16 competing teams in the tournament.\n2017–2020.\nThe 2017 tournament, hosted in China, also grew a considerable prize pool of roughly $5 million. Riot once again in 2017 decided to take profits from skin sales to increase the prize pool. The initial pool was $2 million and 250 thousand dollars, however, Championship Ashe, the new championship skin for 2017, sold well. 25% of Championship Ashe and ward sales allowed the prize pool to grow. 24 teams battled until only SK Telecom T1 and Samsung Galaxy were the last 2 teams standing. Samsung Galaxy won dominantly with a 3–0 against SK Telecom T1 in the Beijing National Stadium (Bird's Nest), allowing Samsung Galaxy to take home the 1st place prize pool of $1.8 million. The 2018 tournament, hosted in South Korea, was the chance for Riot to continue to exceed expectations. Riot, as was tradition now, took 12.5% of Championship Kha'Zix and ward sales to increase the prize pool. The other 12.5% was decided to be divided among all participating teams of the tournament. The prize pool rose compared from last year's $5 million to roughly $6.5 million. The finals were held in The Munhak Stadium in Incheon, where Fnatic faced off against Invictus Gaming Invictus Gaming would go on to 3–0 sweep Fnatic to take home the 1st place prize pool of $2.4 million. This would be Invictus Gaming's first World Championship Win, and also the first time a Chinese Team would win a World Championship. The 2019 tournament, hosted in Europe, lead to another clean sweep match. FunPlus Phoenix, a team made in 2017 faced off and took a 3–0 victory from the well established European team, G2 Esports in AccorHotels Arena in Paris, France, winning roughly 800 thousand dollars from the prize pool.\nThe 2020 tournament began on September 25 in China, and the final was held in the Pudong Football Stadium on October 31.\n2021–present.\nThe 2021 tournament was held from October 5 to November 6 in Reykjavík, Iceland, where all games were played offline without a live audience due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Originally the tournament was to be held again in China as a traditional Worlds.\n The tournament was won by Edward Gaming, who defeated DWG KIA (Pronounced as Damwong KIA) in 5 games in the Final, denying DWG a second Worlds title in a row after they won in 2020. This was the last Worlds where teams from the CIS region, who qualified via the LCL, took part, as their 2022 season was suspended early on in the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and didn't return, eventually merging into the LEC ecosystem as a regional league.\nThe 2022 tournament was held in the United States and Mexico, with the latter of whom hosting the play-in stage. DRX, the LCK's 4 seed, would have a miraculous run through all stages of the tournament, easily topping their play-in group before winning Group C in a tiebreaker game with LEC side Rouge and proceeding to beat both defending champions Edward Gaming and Gen.G in the knockouts. The DRX team, led by Deft, would face a T1 side who was looking for their 4th title in the finals. DRX took T1 all the way to the fifth game in San Francisco and proceeded to win, making them the only team in the history of the World Championship to win the Summoner's Cup from the play-in stage. In addition, this was the last Worlds where teams from the Oceania and Turkey regions, who qualified via the LCO and TCL respectively, took part; from 2023 on the top teams from the LCO would compete in the Pacific Championship Series playoffs with teams from Hong Kong/Taiwan/Macau/Southeast Asia (Excluding Vietnam) for spots in MSI and Worlds, while the TCL entered the LEC ecosystem as a regional league that qualified teams for EMEA Masters.\nThe 2023 tournament returned Worlds to South Korea and brought with it considerable changes to the format of the tournament. The play-in round became mostly a GSL-style double-elimination affair with two qualifying matches to decide who would make the main event, with one of the spots being decided by a Worlds Qualifying Series between the 4th seeds from the LCS and LEC, while the main event converted to a Swiss-system tournament similar to those found in the \"Counter-Strike\" Majors. As a result, all qualified teams from the LCK and LPL automatically made the Swiss stage, while only the LCS and LEC joined them in automatic spots with 3 apiece. JD Gaming were heavy favorites to complete the elusive \"Golden Road\", which is when a team wins both the Spring and Summer splits of their league, plus MSI and Worlds, but were eliminated in the semi-finals. This time, T1 and Faker would get their fourth Summoner's Cup after sweeping Weibo Gaming in the finals 3 games to 0. The finals would set the highest-ever single-game viewership record (Excluding Chinese viewers) with a peak of 6.4 million viewers. Like with the LCO, this would be Japan and the LJL's last Worlds as a separate league, as they joined the PCS ecosystem in time for 2024, with the top LJL teams making the PCS playoffs.\nMid-Season Invitational.\nThe Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) is an annual \"League of Legends\" tournament hosted by publisher Riot Games since 2015. It is the second most important international \"League of Legends\" tournament aside from the World Championship.\nRegional leagues.\nOn February 7, 2013, Riot Games created the \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (LCS), separate professional leagues for Europe and North America, where initially 8 teams would compete in a league structure similar to those found in other professional sports leagues (Particularly Liga MX and other Latin American association football leagues that have split seasons) with promotion and relegation with a second-tier Challengers Series; each LCS soon expanded to 10 teams to accommodate demand. In 2018, the NA LCS dropped promotion and relegation in favor of a franchising system similar to American professional sports leagues like the NFL; the European league followed suit in 2019. In late 2018, the European \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (EU LCS) was renamed to the \"League of Legends\" European Championship (LEC). The North American \"League of Legends\" Championship Series (NA LCS) also dropped \"North American\" from its name, and was renamed to simply the League Championship Series ahead of the 2019 season. \nEquivalent leagues, run by Riot and local publishers, also exist in other regions. This includes the Pro League (LPL) in China by Tencent, Champions Korea (LCK) in South Korea (Originally run by television channel Ongamenet (OGN) with its own group stage and knockout format before being run by Riot), the Pacific Championship Series (PCS) in Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau/Southeast Asia and the Vietnam Championship Series (VCS) by Garena (With the Japan League (LJL) and the Circuit Oceania (LCO) by ESL Australia and Guinevere Capital as partnered leagues with the PCS that send their best teams to the PCS playoffs), the Campeonato Brasileiro (CBLOL) in Brazil and the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in Latin America. The Continental League (LCL) in the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Turkish Championship League (TCL) in Turkey were also separate leagues that qualified teams for major international events but have since become EMEA regional leagues within the LEC ecosystem, who qualify teams for EMEA Masters alongside other leagues from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa."

His historic record was well known, but his semi-final was his fastest race of the year making him an unknown quantity. In fact, the entire 2015 podium and the 2016 Olympic podium were in this event, though 2008 Olympic champion and 2015 bronze medalist Brimin Kipruto (Kenya) at age 33 didn't make the final.\nSummary.\nIn the final Conseslus Kipruto (Kenya) went to the front, but he didn't set a blistering pace to burn off the competition, instead he kept control of the race. Jairus Birech (Kenya) and Evan Jager (USA) stayed close behind. After a leisurely 2:51.81 first kilometre, after which entire Ethiopian team of Tesfaye Deriba, Tafese Seboka and Getnet Wale moved ahead to push the pace. Kemboi was biding his time along the rail. Jacob Araptany (Uganda) lost his shoe and stopped in the middle of the track to fix it, taking him completely out of contention.\nAfter four laps, Jager moved to the front and increased the pace, with only Kipruto, Birech, Ezekiel Kemboi and Soufiane El Bakkali (Morocco) staying in the front group with him. Birech, and later Kemboi, dropped away, and Jager led the remaining trio until they reached the beginning of the final backstretch, where Kipruto accelerated past Jager, followed by El Bakkali. By the water jump, El Bakkali had pulled even, but Kipruto had more speed down the final straightaway. Jager held third place despite a late run from Mahiedine Mekhissi.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 8:32.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 6 August in three heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next six fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

By 15K in 59:33 (19:45), the pack was down to eight and defending champion Miguel Ángel López (Spain) was no longer one of them. Rallying from a 23 second deficit at 10K, South African Lebogang Shange came back to the group as others dropped off. By the last 2K loop, the leaders Éider Arévalo (Colombia) and Sergey Shirobokov, an Authorised Neutral Athlete were in racewalking's version of a sprint finish, dropping Shange, Christopher Linke (Germany), Dane Bird-Smith (Australia), Wang Kaihua (China) and Caio Bonfim (Brazil) to fight for bronze. Arévalo broke the race open enough to get a Colombian flag from the audience, holding it around his neck as he made sure he had enough of a gap on Shirobokov, then crossing the finish line with the flag held high two seconds ahead. 9 second behind them, Bonfim had broken away from Shange to secure bronze.

First-free-ascents that set new grade milestones are important events in rock climbing history, and are listed below. While sport climbing has dominated absolute-grade milestones since the mid-1980s (i.e. are now the highest grades), milestones for modern traditional climbing, free solo climbing, onsighted, and flashed ascents, are also listed.\nA route's grade is provisional until enough climbers have repeated the route to have a \"consensus\". At the highest grades, this can take years as few climbers are capable of repeating these routes. For example, in 2001, \"Realization\" was considered the world's first , however, the first repeat of the 1996 route \"\", which only happened in 2008, suggested that it was possibly the first . \"Open Air\" has had no further repeats, and has had holds broken since 1996, whereas \"Realization\" has had many ascents and is thus a \"consensus\" 9a+.

        "text": "The men's 50 kilometres walk at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held on a two kilometre course comprising lengths of The Mall between Buckingham Palace and Admiralty Arch on 13 August.\nSummary.\nFour days before the event, three time World Championship medallist, Australia's Jared Tallent was forced to withdraw from the event due to a hamstring injury.\nFrom the start, world record holder, 39 year old Yohann Diniz (FRA) walked with a sense of purpose. Save a silver medal in 2007, the World Championships had resulted in disqualifications and failure for him as had the Olympics. On this course in 2012, Diniz became disoriented and was left by the lead pack lying on the ground after he tripped over a barricade.\nFrom the gun, Diniz walked at his own pace at the front of the pack. He had to make a quick, unplanned pit stop before the 5k mark which brought him back to the pack of some 20 competitors, but really only Horacio Nava (MEX) was able to stay with him for a short while. Again Diniz set sail solo and continued building his lead. 41 seconds at 10k, 1:32 at 15k, 2:10 at 20k, 2:59 by halfway. Reminiscent of last year's Olympics, would his huge lead evaporate into another catastrophe?\nChasing Diniz was a pack of podium suitors that stayed together with individuals falling off the back. By half way it was down to seven, with two Ecudorians; Claudio Villanueva and Andrés Chocho; two Japanese Hirooki Arai and Kai Kobayashi; Aleksi Ojala (FIN); Evan Dunfee (CAN); and Yu Wei (CHN). That group stayed together past 35k, where Diniz had a 4:21 lead. At 36k, the two Japanese teammates took off on their own. In the next 4k, they put 27 seconds on the next challenger Dunfee, while Chocho was disqualified for form violation and asked off the course.\nDiniz did not suffer a catastrophe. By the last 2k loop, he had lapped everybody except four walkers. Like his world record three years earlier, Diniz spent the last lap celebrating; tying a French flag around his neck like a bandana, slapping hands with the spectators in the front row. He held the French flag above his head as he crossed the finish line. The two Japanese worked together to keep up the pace, the more experienced Arai finally taking a slight lead for silver, 8:05 behind Diniz. It was the second fastest 50k racewalk of all time, only behind Diniz' world record and the largest margin of victory in World Championship history.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 4:06:00.\nResults.\nThe final took place on 13 August at 07:46.

        "text": "The women's 50 kilometres walk at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held on a 2 kilometre course comprising lengths of The Mall between Buckingham Palace and Admiralty Arch on 13 August.\nSummary.\nThis was the first time women were offered this event in the world championships, finally equalizing all events for both genders. Only seven women toed the start line. With the event in its infancy, Inês Henriques (POR) had set the world record in January.\nFrom the start, Henriques was dominating the race though Yin Hang (CHN) was with her virtually stride for stride through the halfway point. Two years prior to this becoming an IAAF ratified event, Erin Taylor-Talcott held the world record. Here she was disqualified early on, after the 5k mark. Behind the lead pack, a chase pack formed by Yang Shuqing (CHN), Katie Burnett (USA) and Nair da Rosa (BRA) walking closely together past 15k before da Rosa fell off the pace. Shortly after the half way mark, Burnett fell off Yang's pace, but she didn't go away. By 35k, Burnett was 50 seconds behind Yang, but she pulled it back, getting within breathing room of Yang as the race was closing in the last 5k.\nHenriques continued to widen her lead to over three minutes on Yin. Yin managed to pull back a few seconds over the final 5k, finishing less than a minute short of Henriques' previous world record, but Henriques took two and a half minutes off of that record with this win in 4:05:56. After a scare, Yang opened up a minute over the last 5k on Burnett for bronze. Both silver medalist Yin and fourth place Burnett set their respective continental records.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 4:30:00.\nResults.\nThe final took place on 13 August at 07:46.

Still the race started faster than the Olympics. A pack of 20 formed on the front. That pack was whittled down to 10 by the halfway point. After Kimberly García (Peru) fell off the pace, the group was reduced to just five by the 12-kilometre mark: two Chinese, Yang Jiayu and Lü Xiuzhi; María Guadalupe González (Mexico); Antonella Palmisano (Italy); and Erica de Sena (Brazil). de Sena fell off the pace when the other four accelerated the pace at 16K. Another lap later, Palmisano couldn't handle the pace which looked like the break for the three medalists. Yang didn't have the same awards, but she was leading the group with the Olympic silver and bronze medalists.\nThe three were racing to the finish. Less than 100 metres before the finish, the chief judge stepped out to show Lü the red card signifying she had accumulated three red cards from judges around the course and was disqualified. Lü didn't believe the message and tried to finish, but it was true. Yang raced González to the line, winning by barely a second. Palmisano came in 17 seconds later to get an unexpected bronze. The top five did negative splits (walking the end of the race faster than the beginning). de Sena improved her own South American continental record.

        "title": "2017 World Championships in Athletics – Women's marathon",
        "text": "The women's marathon was one of the road events at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in London. It took place on 6 August 2017 on the streets of London, and consisted of four laps of a roughly course which passed several of London's landmarks. For the first time in World Championships history, the men's and women's marathons took place on the same day. The race was won by Rose Chelimo of Bahrain in 2:27:11, seven seconds ahead of Kenya's Edna Kiplagat in second. Amy Cragg of the United States finished in third, separated from Kiplagat by less than a second.\nCatarina Ribeiro of Portugal led for the first before relinquishing the lead to Great Britain's Alyson Dixon, who opened up a 30-second lead halfway through the race. She was gradually caught over the next , and a pack of fourteen runners vied for the lead until the point, when Chelimo increased the pace and four runners broke away at the front. Chelimo and Kiplagat battled for the lead of the race, while Cragg and Kenya's Flomena Cheyech Daniel fought for third place. Ultimately, sprint finishes from Chelimo and Cragg secured them first and third respectively.\nQualification.\nThe International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF, now known as World Athletics) announced the qualifying criteria for the 2017 World Championships in Athletics in March 2016. For the women's marathon, the entry standard was 2:45:00, one minute slower than for the 2015 World Championships, and the same as for the 2016 Olympics. Entry criteria had to be met during the qualification period: 1 October 2016, and 23 July 2017, inclusive.\nPreview.\nIn November 2016, the marathon route was announced; the course consisted of four laps of a roughly route passing by some of London's historic landmarks. The course started and finished on Tower Bridge, travelled along Victoria Embankment along the River Thames until it reached the Houses of Parliament, looped away from the river past St Paul's Cathedral, before heading back to the Tower of London. Niels de Vos, the tournament director, said that the route was designed to be as flat as possible to allow for the possibility of fast times, while also aiming to use well-known landmarks to provide \"a stunning backdrop to a huge global TV audience\".\nFor the first time in the World Championships, the men's and women's marathons were scheduled to take place on the same day; the men's race at 10:55 and the women's at 14:00. The weather was forecast to be between , with a southwesterly wind which \"LetsRun.com\" suggested could be particularly significant on the exposed parts of the route along the river.\nThe race featured ten women who had previously completed sub-2:22 marathons, leading \"LetsRun.com\" to speculate that \"You won’t find a deeper marathon on planet Earth this year than the women's race at the 2017 World Championships.\" They suggested that Edna Kiplagat of Kenya, Ethiopia's Mare Dibaba and Eunice Kirwa of Bahrain were the favourites for the race. Kiplagat had won the marathon twice before at the World Championships, in 2011 and 2013, and had won the Boston Marathon earlier in the year. Dibaba had raced at the 2017 London Marathon, where she did not finish, but was the reigning World Champion, having won in 2015. Kirwa had finished second to Dibaba in 2015, and had also been runner-up at the 2016 Olympics. \"Athletics Weekly\" also predicted that Kiplagat and Mare Dibaba would finish in the top-three, but included another Ethiopian, Berhane Dibaba, alongside them. Mary Keitany, who had broken the women-only marathon world record earlier in the year, did not take part in the World Championships, opting instead to prepare for the 2017 New York City Marathon.\nSummary.\nThe race started at 14:00 on 6 August 2017, in temperatures of and a humidity level of 56%. In the opening stages of the race, Portugal's Catarina Ribeiro broke away and led the first of the race, before she was caught by Alyson Dixon of Great Britain. Ribeiro ultimately dropped out of the race, and did not finish. Dixon ran alone at the head of the field, and by the halfway stage she had established a 30-second gap to the pack behind. During the second half of the race, the main group closed the gap on Dixon, narrowing it to 14 seconds by the point, and catching her just before the point. Dixon, who stayed with the leading pack for another before falling back to finish 18th, said after \"I never in my wildest dreams expected to be leading. If you can't enjoy running a World Championship in London with that support, what are you in the sport for?\"\nAfter the pack caught Dixon, Kiplagat initially took on the lead, before Australia's Jessica Trengove took over around the mark. By this stage, the leading group contained fourteen runners, but Chelimo soon increased the pace and split the pack up. A group of four runners broke away at the front: Chelimo; Kiplagat; Amy Cragg of the United States; and Kenya's Flomena Cheyech Daniel. Kiplagat made the next push, and led with just over to go; \"Canadian Running\"s Sinead Mulhern compared the finish to that of the Boston Marathon earlier in the year, when Kiplagat had beaten Chelimo in a sprint finish. On this occasion, Chelimo counter-attacked and moved back ahead of Kiplagat, who could not respond; and Chelimo held on to claim the gold medal by seven seconds, in 2:27:11. Behind the pair, Cragg managed a sprint finish to beat Daniel to third place, and almost caught Kiplagat; both runners were credited with a finish time of 2:27.18. Dagmara Handzlik of Cyprus, who finished 35th in a time of 2:38:52, established a new national record."

        "text": "The 2018 Masters (officially the 2018 Dafabet Masters) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place between 14 and 21 January 2018 in London, England, and the second Triple Crown event of the 2017–18 snooker season. It was the 44th staging of the Masters, and was broadcast in Europe by the BBC and Eurosport.\nThe event saw two first-time Triple Crown finalists. Mark Allen won his first, defeating Kyren Wilson 10–7 in the final. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan lost 1–6 in the quarter-finals to the eventual champion, Allen. It was O'Sullivan's first defeat at the Masters since 2015.\nTournament summary.\nThe 2018 Dafabet Masters saw the sixteen highest ranked players in the snooker world rankings compete, with no qualification round. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was the number one seed, with remaining places being allocated to players based on the world rankings after the 2017 UK Championship.\nWith Stuart Bingham, ranked 12th, suspended for betting breaches, Liang Wenbo, ranked 17th, was invited in his stead. Luca Brecel and Anthony McGill made their Masters debuts at the event. A notable absentee was former Masters champion Neil Robertson, who had participated in every Masters tournament since 2006, but had failed to be ranked high enough in time for the event, at rank 20; Robertson would return to the event the following season.\nAs in previous years, the top eight seeds were allocated fixed positions in the draw. The other eight players were positioned by drawing lots during the final of the 2017 UK Championship.\nFirst round.\nSixteen players took part in the first round of the competition, which was played between 14 and 17 January 2018. Defending champion and top seed, Ronnie O'Sullivan, whitewashed ninth seed Marco Fu 6–0, making three centuries during the match. In the first four frames, O'Sullivan scored a total of 477 points without reply while Fu gained only five points due to a foul.\nMark Williams won a match at the Masters for the first time in five years, recovering from 3–5 behind to beat World Champion and World number one, Mark Selby, 6–5. Playing in his first Masters tournament in eight years, the other Welsh player in the draw, Ryan Day, came from 0–3 down to beat World number four and former champion, Ding Junhui, 6–4.\nShaun Murphy defeated Ali Carter 6–4. Murphy was leading 4–0 before Carter won the next four frames to level the match, but Murphy survived the comeback and won two more frames for victory. Former World Championship finalist, Judd Trump, defeated Liang Wenbo by a score of 6–4 in the first round.\nMark Allen safely reached the second round by defeating Masters debutant Luca Brecel 6–3. Kyren Wilson secured his first victory in a Masters match after having lost in the first round of his Masters debut the previous year. He defeated former Masters finalist, Barry Hawkins, 6–4 in the first round of this edition of the tournament. Former champion, John Higgins, won the first two frames in his tie against Anthony McGill, before McGill took the next four (including a match-high of 122 in frame 4) to lead 4–2. Higgins, however, won the next four frames to win the match 6–4.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played on 18 and 19 January 2018. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan was knocked out of the tournament by Mark Allen, who won their quarter-final match 6–1. Having suffered his first loss at the Masters since 2015, O'Sullivan claimed afterwards that he had been feeling ill before the match and was \"glad\" to be out of the competition. He also revealed, however, that he had not been feeling well during his whitewash of Marco Fu in the first round. After the match, Allen mentioned the negative crowd reaction, saying that his playing style had been affected by some of O'Sullivan's fans.\nJohn Higgins defeated Ryan Day in the second quarter-final, with another 6–1 scoreline.&lt;ref name=\"Higgins/Day\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Higgins made a break of 83 in the opening frame, Day won frame 2, then Higgins took the next five frames with breaks of 61, 63, 65, 80 and 113 to win the match. Kyren Wilson defeated Mark Williams, again 6–1, in the third quarter-final match. Wilson took the first four frames, Williams won the fifth, then Wilson took frames 6 and 7 with two century breaks to win the match.\nIn the last of the quarter-finals, Judd Trump defeated Shaun Murphy 6–4.&lt;ref name=\"Trump/Murphy\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Trump made four 50+ breaks in the first six frames and built up a lead of 4–2, before Murphy took the next two frames to tie the match 4–4. Trump then won the next two frames, with breaks of 111 and 113, to win the match. Play was briefly interrupted when a wasp landed on the table during the match. Afterwards, Murphy admitted that he had been concerned, saying he was \"terrified of wasps, who isn't?\"\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals took place on 20 January 2018, the penultimate day of the event. In the first semi-final, Kyren Wilson defeated Judd Trump 6–5 to reach his first Triple Crown final. Trump started the match with a lead of 3–1, and later 5–2, owing to breaks of 83, 96 and 69. Wilson took both of the next two frames, and then made a break of 107 in the tenth frame to tie 5–5, forcing a decider. Trump was the first of the two players to make progress in the final frame, but lost position after a break of 23, leaving Wilson in amongst the balls; Wilson then made an \"outstanding\" break of 72 to win the match.&lt;ref name=\"Judd/Wilson\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nIn the second semi-final, Mark Allen dispatched another former multiple World and Masters Champion, John Higgins, 6–3. After making breaks of 63 and 90, Allen took a 3–1 lead at the mid-session interval. Higgins created a break of 131 in the fifth frame (his 700th competitive century break), but Allen won the next two frames to lead 5–2. In frame 8, Higgins scored the second century of the match to trail 3–5, before Allen won the match in the ninth frame to reach his first Masters final. Post-match, Higgins admitted that his tactical play was \"very poor\".&lt;ref name=\"Allen/Higgins\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nFinal.\nThe final took place on 21 January 2018, over two sessions, in a best-of-19-frames match. This was the first time since 1995 that two first-time finalists had met in the Masters final; neither Mark Allen (8) nor Kyren Wilson (13) had ever previously reached the final of a Masters tournament. Allen defeated Wilson 10–7 to win the title. This was Allen's first major title in his fourteen years as a professional.\nThe two players ended the first session tied at 4–4, and shared the first two frames of the second session to tie the match again at 5–5. Allen made a break of 73 in the eleventh frame to lead 6–5; he then took a two-frame lead with a break of 119 in frame 12, and also won frame 13 to lead 8–5. Wilson won the next two frames to reduce his deficit to a single frame, at 7–8. Allen took frames 16 and 17, with breaks of 69 and 71 respectively, to win the tournament.&lt;ref name=\"allen/wilson\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter the match, Wilson cried on receiving his runners-up medal. He commented: \"I just made things a bit too easy for Mark, you can't do that to a player of Mark's class, he's too good and he'll punish you. That's what he did tonight.\"\nPrize fund.\nThe event received identical prize money to that of the previous year, with £200,000 for the winner, and £600,000 overall. The highest break prize of £10,000 was won by Liang Wenbo, for a break of 139.\nThe breakdown of prize money is shown below:\nCentury breaks.\nThe event saw a total of 28 century breaks throughout the tournament, with Liang Wenbo completing the highest tournament break of 139.\nCoverage.\nThe tournament was broadcast live in the United Kingdom by BBC Sport, as well as on Eurosport in Europe. Worldwide, the event was covered by China Central Television and Superstars Online in China, and Sky Sports in New Zealand. NowTV presented the event in Hong Kong with additional commentary.\nAftermath.\nThe Masters was followed by the 2018 German Masters, which was won by Mark Williams. Masters winner Mark Allen was defeated in the first round, losing 4–5 to Matthew Selt. At the following year's event, the 2019 Masters, both finalists would lose in the first round: Mark Allen 5–6 to Luca Brecel, and Kyren Wilson 2–6 to Judd Trump."

        "text": "As of 2017, European Tour Productions serves as the host broadcaster for the Open Championship. The host broadcaster, as well as British and American broadcasters Sky Sports and NBC Sports respectively, utilized a total of 175 cameras during the 2016 tournament.\nCoverage overview.\nIn the United Kingdom, the Open Championship was historically broadcast by the BBC—a relationship which lasted from 1955 to 2015. The BBC's rights to the Open had been threatened by the event's removal from Category A of Ofcom's \"listed\" events, a status which legally mandated that the Open be broadcast in its entirety by a terrestrial broadcaster. It had since been moved to Category B, meaning that television rights to the tournament could now be acquired by a pay television outlet, such as BT Sport or Sky Sports, as long as rights to broadcast a highlights programme are given to one of the main terrestrial broadcasters.\nBeginning in 2016, Sky Sports will have exclusive UK rights to The Open with the BBC showing a 2-hour highlights programme every night instead of live coverage. Sky's major event coverage is fronted by David Livingstone, expert analysis from Butch Harmon, on course commentary from Howard Clark, in-depth 18th hole interviews from tour coach and golfing expert, Tim Barter and main commentary from Ewen Murray and Bruce Critchley. Other golfers such as Peter Oosterhuis, Tony Johnstone, Thomas Bjørn, David Howell, Richard Boxall, Jamie Spence, Mark Roe, Robert Lee, Ross McFarlane, Sandy Lyle, Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley, Philip Parkin and Ken Brown contributing to their coverage over the years.\nIn the United States, ABC had historically held rights to the Open. Beginning in 2010 under an eight-year agreement, the Open moved exclusively to ABC's sister pay television channel ESPN, with only tape-delayed highlights shown on ABC. In June 2015, it was announced that NBC Sports would acquire rights to the Open Championship under a 12-year deal beginning in 2017; early round coverage airs on USA Network, with the main NBC network broadcasting live weekend coverage. The R&amp;A cited NBC's successful broadcasts of Premier League football, which also primarily airs on weekend mornings in U.S. time zones, as an advantage of NBC's acquisition of The Open. Similarly to the BBC, ESPN chose to opt out of its final year of Open rights, causing NBC's rights to begin in 2016 instead.\nAdditional notes.\nEarly ABC coverage.\n1982-1996\nLater ABC and ESPN coverage.\n1997-2005\n2006-2015 \nNBC and Golf Channel.\n2016–present"

        "title": "Authorised Neutral Athletes at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics",
        "text": "The Authorised Neutral Athletes are Russian athletes who are permitted to compete in the 2017 World Championships in Athletics by special permission, despite the IAAF's suspension of the Russian Athletic Federation. In order to compete, Russian athletes must demonstrate that they were not involved in the that precipitated Russia's suspension from international athletics.\nBackground.\nIn July 2016, Richard McLaren presented the report of the WADA Commission in Toronto, Ontario, indicating systematic state-sponsored subversion of the drug testing processes by the government of Russia during and subsequent to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In December 2016, he published the second part of his report on doping in Russia.\nSome Russians have called the allegations an anti-Russian plot while others consider that Russia was \"just doing what the rest of the world does\". Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Russia had \"never supported any violations in sport, we have never supported it at the state level, and we will never support this\" and that the allegations were part of an \"anti-Russia policy\" by the West. Aleksei Pushkov, chairman of Russia's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, said that the IAAF's decision to uphold its ban was \"an act of political revenge against Russia for its independent foreign policy.\" A member of Russia's parliament, Vadim Dengin, stated, \"The entire doping scandal is a pure falsification, invented to discredit and humiliate Russia.\" After the Court of Arbitration for Sport turned down an appeal by Russian athletes, pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva wrote, \"Let all those pseudo clean foreign athletes breathe a sigh of relief and win their pseudo gold medals in our absence. They always did fear strength.\" The Ministry of Foreign Affairs called the ruling a \"crime against sport\". A poll by the Levada Center found that 14% of Russians believed that the country's athletes had doped in Sochi, 71% did not believe WADA's reports, and 15% decided not to answer.\nA spokesman for Putin called Stepanova a \"Judas\". The Russian media have also criticised the Stepanovs. Yuliya Stepanova said, \"All the news stories call me a traitor and not just traitor but a traitor to the Motherland.\" Vitaly Stepanov said, \"I wasn't trying to expose Russia, I was trying to expose corrupt sports officials that are completely messing up competitions not just inside the country but globally.\" \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung\" reported that the Russian media portrayed the German documentaries as \"part of a Western conspiracy with the aim of weakening the great nation that Vladimir Putin lifted from its knees.\" Hajo Seppelt had the \"impression that he and the Stepanovs were being styled as enemies of the state\".\nDick Pound described Russia's response as \"a bit like when you get stopped for speeding on the freeway by the police and you say 'why me? everyone else was doing it'.\" He stated that if Russia's authorities had \"responded to their issues they could easily have enough time to sort everything out in time for Rio. But instead they played the role of victims, claiming there was a plot against them for too long.\" Leonid Bershidsky, a Russian writer for Bloomberg View, wrote that Russia's \"officials need to understand that \"whataboutism\" doesn't avert investigations\". The Moscow correspondent of \"Deutsche Welle\", Juri Rescheto, wrote that the response he saw in Russia \"shows that the country is living in a parallel universe\" and seeks to blame others. Writing for \"The New York Times\", Andrew E. Kramer said that Russia responded to the IAAF's decision against reinstatement with \"victimhood\" reflecting a \"culture of grievances that revolves around perceived slights and anti-Russian conspiracies taking place in the outside world, particularly in Western countries\". The newspaper's editorial board also saw a \"narrative of victimization\" in Russia, and wrote that it resembled how the Soviet Union would respond to a punishment – by saying that it was \"politically motivated, always a provocation, never justified. [Even] though the Cold War is long over, President Vladimir Putin remains stuck in the same, snarling defensive crouch in his responses to any accusations of Russian foul play\". Andrew Osborn of Reuters wrote that the Russian government had \"deftly deflected the blame by passing it off as a Western Cold War-style plot to sabotage Russia's international comeback.\" In response to Russia's opinion that the allegations were \"politically motivated\", WADA's former chief investigator, Jack Robertson, said that he saw politics \"when Craig Reedie tried to intervene by writing emails to the Russian ministry to console them.\"\nMatch TV said that Americans had orchestrated the doping scandal and modern pentathlon champion Aleksander Lesun called it an unfair \"attack\" because \"Doping is in all countries and there are violators everywhere.\" Following the IOC's announcement on 24 July 2016, Russian sports minister Vitaly Mutko said it was \"a just and fair decision and we hope every federation will take the same kind of decision. Doping is a worldwide evil, not only of Russia.\" The Russian media's reaction was \"nearly euphoric at points.\"\nA reporter from Russian state-owned television told IOC President Thomas Bach that \"It looked like you personally were helping us\" and asked whether the doping investigation was a \"political attack\" on Russian athletes. After Russian athletes said that McLaren was about \"politics\" rather than sport, the British biathlon association stated that their comments were \"brain-washed, deluded and dishonest\" and decided to boycott an event in Russia. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that athletes should be \"punished\" for calls to boycott.\nPetitions for inclusion.\nIn 2016 and 2017 they were permitted to compete in the championship through special permission granted by the IAAF. The IAAF had suspended the Russian national federation from competing due to breach of anti-doping rules, and Klishina was the only member of the athletics team allowed to compete. This was then reversed on 13 August 2016. Klishina immediately appealed the decision, saying that she is \"a clean athlete and have proved that already many times and beyond any doubt. Based in the US for three years now, I have been almost exclusively tested outside of the Anti-Doping system in question. I am falling victim to those who created a system of manipulating our beautiful sport and is guilty of using it for political purposes.\" On 15 August 2016, the eve of the long jump event, Klishina's appeal was upheld, once again allowing her to compete in the Olympics."

        "text": "Matthew Williams Jr. (born October 14, 1993) is an American professional basketball player. Born and raised in Orlando, Florida, Williams played college basketball at the University of Central Florida (UCF).\nCollege career.\nWilliams came to UCF from Jones High School in Orlando. He suffered several medical setbacks as he suffered a burst appendix as a freshman, then played through knee pain as a sophomore. Early in his junior season, Williams had tests and learned that his knee pain was due to inferior bipartite patella, a rare congenital condition requiring surgery. Williams had the surgery, missing the majority of that season.\nFollowing his redshirt junior season, Williams graduated from UCF and entertained transferring for his remaining year of collegiate eligibility. He originally chose to transfer to Wake Forest, but ultimately changed his mind and returned to UCF for his final year to play for new Knights coach Johnny Dawkins. In his fifth year, Williams upped his scoring average from 8.1 to 15.1 points per game, helping lead the Knights to the semifinals of the 2017 National Invitation Tournament. Williams finished his UCF career as the school's leader in three-pointers for a career (274), season (126) and game (11). The season and game marks were also American Athletic Conference records.\nProfessional career.\nMiami Heat/Sioux Falls Skyforce (2017–2018).\nFollowing the close of his college career, Williams played for the Miami Heat in the 2017 NBA Summer League. At the end of the league, he signed with the Heat for the 2017–18 season. On October 15, his contract was converted to a two-way deal, meaning he'd be able to split playing time between the Heat and their NBA G League affiliate, the Sioux Falls Skyforce. He spent the first week of the season with the Heat before an assignment in the G-League. He was then recalled on December 20 as the Heat endured several simultaneous injuries. Williams played 3 minutes, posting a rebound and 4 assists against the New Orleans Pelicans on December 23. He appeared in a total of 3 games, tallying 5 points and a rebound in 11 minutes of action before he was waived on New Year's Eve in order for the team to sign Derrick Jones Jr. Williams was later reacquired by the Sioux Falls Skyforce.\nKTP and Kymi (2018–2019).\nOn September 12, 2018, Williams joined KTP Basket of the Finnish Korisliiga. In January 2019, Williams signed with Kymi of the Greek Basket League. In 12 GBL games, Williams averaged 8.8 points and 2.7 rebounds in 26 minutes per game.\nDonar (2019–2020).\nOn July 16, 2019, Williams signed with Donar of the Dutch Basketball League. The 2019–20 season was cancelled prematurely in March because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Williams returned to the United States. He averaged 14.6 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.7 assists in 21 DBL games.\nCimarrones Caribbean Storm (2020–2021).\nWilliams spent the 2020-21 season in Colombia with the Cimarrones Caribbean Storm, averaging 7.0 points and 2.0 rebounds per game.\nGTK Gliwice (2021).\nOn August 11, 2021, Williams signed with GTK Gliwice of the Polish Basketball League. In 13 games, he averaged 9.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game.\nLavrio (2021–2022).\nOn December 11, 2021, Williams officially returned to Greece, signing with BCL club Lavrio. In 14 games, he averaged only 4.6 points, 1 rebound and 0.5 assists, playing around 18 minutes per game.\nSupersónicos de Miranda (2022).\nIn July 2022, Williams signed with the Supersónicos de Miranda of the Venezuelan SuperLiga."

In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nCounty Cup Final appearances.\nJoe Pearce played in Wakefield Trinity's 3–10 defeat by Huddersfield in the 1926 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1926–27 season at Headingley, Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Wednesday 1 December 1926, and played in the 0–8 defeat by Leeds in the 1932 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1932–33 season at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield on Saturday 19 November 1932.\nNotable tour matches.\nJoe Pearce played , i.e. number 5, in Wakefield Trinity's 6-17 defeat by Australia in the 1933–34 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain match during the 1933–34 season at Belle Vue, Wakefield on Saturday 28 October 1933."

It began on 30 June with the round of 16 and ended on 15 July with the final match, held at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament. A third place play-off was also played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals.\nFrance won the final 4–2 against Croatia for their second title, while Belgium won the third place play-off 2–0 over England.\nAll times listed are local time.\nFormat.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each), where each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution. If still tied after extra time, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners.\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nFrance vs Argentina.\nThe teams had faced each other in 11 previous matches, including two World Cup group stage matches, both won by Argentina (1–0 in 1930, and 2–1 in 1978).\nAfter nine minutes, Antoine Griezmann's 25-yard free-kick crashed back off Franco Armani's crossbar. After picking the ball up deep inside his own half, Kylian Mbappé set off on a run that was halted when Marcos Rojo hauled him down just inside the area. Griezmann stepped up and converted from the spot, sending the ball low to Armani's right. Four minutes before the interval, Ángel Di María shot from distance with his left foot to beat Hugo Lloris into the top right corner of the net. Three minutes after the restart, Éver Banega's free-kick was headed out towards Lionel Messi whose effort towards goal from the right was diverted past Lloris by Gabriel Mercado with his left leg. Nine minutes later, Lucas Hernandez's cross from the left found Benjamin Pavard, who shot a half-volley from outside the area, sending it into Armani's top-right corner. Mbappé put France ahead again in the 64th minute when he picked up a loose ball in the left of the area, found a yard of space and fired in low with his left foot under Armani. His second – a first-time low finish from the right of the penalty area with his right foot – followed just four minutes later. Sergio Agüero nodded home in the third minute of stoppage time from a Messi cross from the right. Argentina had a final chance to score, but the shot went off target, dumping them out of the World Cup. This game was hailed as \"one of the greatest World Cup games of all time\" by \"The Independent\".\nWith this match, Didier Deschamps became the longest-serving coach in the history of the France national team with his 80th game in charge of France, moving ahead of his predecessor Raymond Domenech. Mbappé became the first teenager to score at least twice in a World Cup tournament since Michael Owen in 1998, and the first teenager to score at least twice in a single World Cup match since Pelé netted twice for Brazil against Sweden in the 1958 final. Argentina became the first team to score at least three goals but still lose a World Cup match since the Soviet Union vs Belgium in 1986. Pavard's strike was later voted as goal of the tournament.\n&lt;section begin=r16-1 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-1 /&gt;\nUruguay vs Portugal.\nThe teams had met in two previous matches, most recently in Brazil Independence Cup in 1972, the match ending in a 1–1 draw.\nIn the seventh minute, Edinson Cavani switched play from right to left with a sweeping pass out to Luis Suárez, who delivered a cross which the former crashed home at the back post from six yards out. In the 55th minute, Raphaël Guerreiro delivered a cross from a short corner on the left, which Pepe finished with a downward header. Just seven minutes later, Rodrigo Bentancur collected the ball around 30 yards out and slipped a pass out to Cavani on the left side of the penalty area, Cavani then shot a curling right-foot strike into the right corner of the net to reclaim the lead for Uruguay. Bernardo Silva shot off-target with the goal gaping after Fernando Muslera's mistake, with Cavani seeming to pick up an injury in the scramble.\nPepe, aged 35 years and 124 days, became Portugal's oldest goal-scorer at a FIFA World Cup. This was the first time Uruguay won their opening four games at a World Cup tournament since 1930, with the fourth game in that run being their 4–2 victory over Argentina in the final.\n&lt;section begin=r16-2 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-2 /&gt;\nSpain vs Russia.\nThe teams had met in six previous games, most recently in a friendly in 2017, which ended in a 3–3 draw. Playing as the Soviet Union, the teams had faced each other five times. Russia only had one victory over Spain.\nIn the 12th minute, Marco Asensio's free-kick from deep on the right saw Sergei Ignashevich grappling with Sergio Ramos at the back post, the ball bouncing past Igor Akinfeev off the defender's heel. Russia were then awarded a penalty when the ball bounced off Artem Dzyuba’s head onto Gerard Piqué’s arm in the box after a corner from the right. Artem Dzyuba shot home to the right of the net from 12 yards to send the sides into half-time level. In the 85th minute, Akinfeev got down low to his right to save a shot from Andrés Iniesta, the goalkeeper then denied Iago Aspas on the rebound. Piqué and Ramos both appeared to be held from a set-piece but, after a VAR check, the referee waved away Spain's appeals. In the penalty shoot-out, Akinfeev kept out a Koke effort and saw Aspas' effort diverted away by his leg to give Russia the win; as all Russia's penalty kicks ended up successful.\nThis result meant Spain lost three of their four World Cup penalty shoot-outs (after losing to Belgium in 1986, beating the Republic of Ireland in 2002 and losing to South Korea in 2002), and had still never defeated a host nation at the FIFA World Cup, after losing to Italy 0–1 in 1934, Brazil 1–6 in 1950, and South Korea after penalties in 2002. Russia reached the quarter-final of the World Cup for the first time since the break-up of the Soviet Union. Also was the first win of Russia in a knockout stage of World Cup since 1966, still like Soviet Union. Ignashevich became the oldest player to score an own goal at the World Cup, aged 38 years and 352 days. The match marked the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup in which a fourth substitution was made during extra time, after Aleksandr Yerokhin of Russia entered the pitch in the 97th minute.\n&lt;section begin=r16-3 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-3 /&gt;\nCroatia vs Denmark.\nThe teams had met in five matches, which included two matches played in 1998 FIFA World Cup qualification, the first fixture ending in a 1–1 draw and the reverse fixture a 3–1 Denmark win.\nIn the first minute, a long throw into the Croatia penalty area by Jonas Knudsen, allowed a run to Thomas Delaney who touched the ball on to Mathias Jørgensen, who side-footed it into the net via deflections off goalkeeper Danijel Subašić and the post. After three minutes, Šime Vrsaljko's ball into the box reached Henrik Dalsgaard, whose clearance hit Andreas Christensen in the face and saw Mario Mandžukić tucking the ball between Kasper Schmeichel and the left post with a shot on the turn from six yards. During extra time, Ante Rebić burst clear of the Denmark defence and was felled by Mathias Jørgensen when he was clean through on goal, only for Schmeichel to save Luka Modrić's spot-kick by diving down to his left and clutching the ball to his chest. In the shoot-out, Subašić tipped off Christian Eriksen's penalty onto the post but Schmeichel saved from Milan Badelj to bring the sides level. Lasse Schöne's shot was saved by Subašić and Josip Pivarić was denied by an acrobatic Schmeichel stop. On the final spot kicks for both the teams, Nicolai Jørgensen took a shot from a staggered run-up which Subašić saved with his feet, before Ivan Rakitić slotted the ball into the bottom left corner of the net.\nCroatia qualified for their first World Cup quarter-final since 1998.\n&lt;section begin=r16-4 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-4 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Mexico.\nThe teams had met in 40 previous matches including two games at CONCACAF Gold Cup finals (1996 and 2003, both won by Mexico), the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup Final (won 4–3 by Mexico), and four times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, three won by Brazil and one ending in a draw (4–0 in 1950, 5–0 in 1954, 2–0 in 1962 and 0–0 in 2014).\nHirving Lozano's half-volley was well blocked by Miranda, while at the other end, Guillermo Ochoa saved Neymar's drive from just outside the penalty area. After 25 minutes, Neymar raced past Edson Álvarez in the area and forced Ochoa into a save with his left hand. Gabriel Jesus went close in the 33rd minute, finding space in a crowded area and drilling in a left-footed strike that Ochoa palmed away. In the 51st minute, Neymar's back-heel on the edge of the area teed up Willian for a burst into the box and his scuffed cross from the left was slid into an empty net by Neymar from close range. With two minutes remaining, Neymar powered through on the left and his low effort was diverted by Ochoa's foot into the path of Roberto Firmino, who tapped the ball into an empty net from close range.\nSince the introduction of the round of 16 in 1986, Mexico were eliminated at this stage of the World Cup seven times – more than twice as many as any other nation. It was also the last time that Mexico has been eliminated in the round of 16 for the final time 4 years later they were eliminated from the group stages for the first time since 1978. This was also Mexico's fourth defeat at the hands of Brazil. In addition, with Neymar's and Firmino's goals, Brazil have now finally surpassed the record of all-time World Cup goals by any team with 228 goals (after being tied to Germany with 226 goals prior to this match) after constantly tying up the record with Germany in the group stage of this World Cup.\n&lt;section begin=r16-5 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-5 /&gt;\nBelgium vs Japan.\nThe teams had faced each other in 5 previous matches, including one World Cup group stage match in 2002, which ended in a 2–2 draw. Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2017, a 1–0 Belgium win and also Belgium's first victory over Japan.\nIn the 48th minute, Gaku Shibasaki slipped a pass through to Genki Haraguchi, who rifled a shot across Thibaut Courtois from the right which went into the left corner of the net. After 4 minutes, Japan scored a second, Shinji Kagawa collecting a loose ball and feeding Takashi Inui, the midfielder working himself a yard of space before arrowing home from 25-yards into the bottom right corner of the net. Jan Vertonghen's looping header from the left eluded goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima and landed in the right corner of the net after a corner caused chaos in the Japan penalty area – and five minutes later they were back on level terms. Eden Hazard twisted and turned to create space on the left wing, his cross delivered for Marouane Fellaini to climb above his marker and crash in a downward header. In the last minute of stoppage time, Courtois found Kevin De Bruyne with a long throw, who freed Thomas Meunier with a pass, Meunier squared a low cross from the right and, when Romelu Lukaku dummied the ball, substitute Nacer Chadli was on hand to complete the comeback for Belgium with a low finish.\nBelgium became the first team to come from two or more goals down to win a World Cup knockout stage match within 90 minutes since Portugal beat North Korea in the 1966 quarter-final (3–0 down, 5–3 win). Japan scored six goals at Russia 2018, their highest ever tally in a single World Cup tournament. Belgium reached the World Cup quarter-finals in successive tournaments for the first time.\n&lt;section begin=r16-6 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-6 /&gt;\nSweden vs Switzerland.\nThe teams had faced each other in 28 previous matches, which included three matches in 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification, Switzerland winning twice (3–2 and 2–1) and Sweden winning once (4–0), and also twice in 1978 FIFA World Cup qualification, both matches ending in a 2–1 Sweden win.\nStephan Lichtsteiner and Fabian Schär were both ruled out through suspension. Albin Ekdal's volley missed the target prior to the break from a Mikael Lustig cross. Ola Toivonen fired over when well positioned inside the penalty area before Emil Forsberg finally broke the deadlock, his right foot shot from just outside the penalty area clipping Manuel Akanji to beat Yann Sommer. Switzerland sent on forwards Breel Embolo and Haris Seferovic, and the latter tested Sweden goalkeeper Robin Olsen with a header in the closing stages. Sweden were denied the chance to double their lead from the spot following Michael Lang's late dismissal for taking out Martin Olsson, with Sommer beating away Toivonen's driven free-kick after a lengthy delay.\nSweden qualified for their first World Cup quarter-final since 1994. Sweden won back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 1958, when they won the quarter-final and semi-final on their way to the final as host nation that year. Olsen kept his third clean sheet of the 2018 World Cup, a joint-record for a Swedish goalkeeper in World Cup finals history (also three clean sheets for Ronnie Hellström in 1974 and Kalle Svensson in 1958).\n&lt;section begin=r16-7 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-7 /&gt;\nColombia vs England.\nThe teams had faced each other in five previous matches, including one World Cup group stage match in 1998, a 2–0 England win. Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2005, a 3–2 England win.\nIn the 16th minute, Harry Kane arrived beyond the back post to meet a Kieran Trippier cross, but was unable to direct his header on target. Wilmar Barrios was booked when he appeared to headbutt Jordan Henderson in the build-up to a free-kick Trippier bent narrowly wide. Colombia gave away a penalty early in the second half when Carlos Sánchez dragged Kane down in the box after a corner from the right. Kane scored from 12 yards, shooting down the middle to give England the lead. Colombia forced their way into extra time, Yerry Mina scoring a downward header from a Juan Cuadrado corner from the right in injury time. Eric Dier scored the final penalty in the shoot-out, with England coming back from 3–2 down after Mateus Uribe and Carlos Bacca failed to convert their spot-kicks.\nThis was the first time that England had won a penalty shoot-out at the FIFA World Cup, and only the second time they had won on penalties at any major tournament (the previous occasion being against Spain at Euro 1996). Kane became the first player to score in six consecutive England appearances since Tommy Lawton did so in 1939. England conceded in injury time at the end of the second half for the first time in World Cup history, with Mina's goal coming after 92 minutes and 33 seconds.\n&lt;section begin=r16-8 /&gt;&lt;section end=r16-8 /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nUruguay vs France.\nThe teams had met in eight previous matches including three times in the FIFA World Cup group stage, one won by Uruguay and the other two ending in a draw (2–1 in 1966, 0–0 in 2002 and 0–0 in 2010).\nIn the 15th minute, after latching on to Olivier Giroud's knockdown in the box, Kylian Mbappé headed the ball over Fernando Muslera's crossbar. Five minutes before the break, Antoine Griezmann's inswinging free kick from the right was met by Raphaël Varane, who headed the ball into the bottom left corner. Four minutes later, Martín Cáceres' header was saved by Hugo Lloris low to his right and Diego Godín shot the rebound over. In the 61st minute, Griezmann's left footed shot from outside the penalty area slipped through Muslera's hands and into the net as France doubled their lead. Mbappé went down softly under a challenge from Cristian Rodríguez, prompting angry confrontations involving Godín, Nahitan Nández and Paul Pogba. In the 73rd minute, Corentin Tolisso's shot curled over, while Griezmann also flashed a late free-kick over the top.\nFrance became only the second team to beat three different South American sides in a single World Cup tournament, after the Netherlands in 1974. This victory marked France's 10th game unbeaten in World Cup matches against South American sides (6 wins and 4 draws), since a 2–1 loss against Argentina in 1978 – the joint longest run alongside Italy (1982 to 2010).\n&lt;section begin=qf1 /&gt;&lt;section end=qf1 /&gt;\nBrazil vs Belgium.\nThe teams had met in four previous matches, including once in a World Cup knockout stage match in 2002 with Brazil winning 2–0 to advance to the quarter-finals, which was the last time the two sides had previously met.\nThiago Silva hit the post with his right thigh for Brazil after a corner in the 8th minute. It was Belgium who scored from their first corner of the game in the 13th minute; Vincent Kompany flicked on Nacer Chadli's delivery, but the decisive touch came from Fernandinho, who turned the ball past Alisson via his arm. Belgium doubled their lead by breaking from a Brazil corner in the 31st minute, after Romelu Lukaku collected the ball, turned, and embarked on a 40-yard run with a pass at the end to free Kevin De Bruyne. De Bruyne, from the edge of the penalty area, arrowed a right foot drive across Alisson and into the left corner of the net. Brazil's third change yielded a goal three minutes and 14 seconds after his introduction, Renato Augusto gliding between two Belgium defenders to nod a flicked header past Thibaut Courtois from a Philippe Coutinho cross. Coutinho's first-time shot flew wide and yet another Neymar penalty appeal was rejected, before he drew a fingertip save from Courtois in the 94th minute.\nDe Bruyne became the 100th player to score at the 2018 World Cup (excluding own goals). Belgium reached the World Cup semi-finals for only the second time, with them losing out to eventual winners Argentina in 1986. Belgium's victory was only their second ever against Brazil, and first since a 1963 friendly match in Brussels. This was the first time in 30 matches in all competitions that Brazil had conceded more than once in a game, since a 2–2 draw with Paraguay in March 2016. Despite Brazil's loss, with Renato Augusto's goal, Brazil have now topped the all-time record of World Cup goals by any team with a total of 229 goals.\n&lt;section begin=qf2 /&gt;&lt;section end=qf2 /&gt;\nSweden vs England.\nThe teams had faced each other in 23 previous matches, including two times in the group stage of the World Cup, both matches ending in a draw (1–1 in 2002 and 2–2 in 2006). Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2012, a 4–2 Sweden win.\nEngland took the lead in the 30th minute, Ashley Young's outswinging corner from the left finding Harry Maguire, goalkeeper Robin Olsen and Ola Toivonen on the line unable to stop the defender's downward header. Olsen did well with a strong hand to deny Raheem Sterling, who dallied with the rebound and allowed Andreas Granqvist to make a vital block. Shortly after the restart, Jordan Pickford dived to his left to palm away a header from Marcus Berg, who climbed above Young at the back post. In the 58th minute, another England set-piece caused chaos and, although Sweden initially cleared their lines when Jesse Lingard delivered a cross from the right to the back post, Dele Alli was there to double his side's advantage with a header. John Guidetti teed up strike partner Berg in the 71st minute, but Pickford tipped the effort over the crossbar.\nAlli's goal was England's 11th at the 2018 World Cup, equalling the country's record of most goals at a single World Cup set in 1966. Alli became the second youngest player to score for England at the World Cup (22 years and 87 days), behind only Michael Owen (18 years and 190 days against Romania in 1998). Maguire became the first defender to score the opening England goal in a World Cup knockout match since Rio Ferdinand in 2002 against Denmark. Pickford made three saves in the match and became the youngest England goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match (24 years and 122 days). England qualified for their first World Cup semi-final since 1990.\n&lt;section begin=qf3 /&gt;&lt;section end=qf3 /&gt;\nRussia vs Croatia.\nThe teams had faced each other in three previous matches. Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2015, a 3–1 Croatia win.\nIn the 31st minute, Denis Cheryshev came in from the left and, after a one-two with Artem Dzyuba, skipped away from Luka Modrić to curl a left foot effort beyond Danijel Subašić and into the left of the net. Six minutes before half-time, Mario Mandžukić advanced down the left to set up the chance for Andrej Kramarić to head home the equaliser. In the first period of extra time, Croatia took the lead as Domagoj Vida nodded down past Igor Akinfeev and into the right corner of the net after a corner from the right. Mário Fernandes drew his team level, converting Alan Dzagoev's free-kick with a glancing header to the left corner of the net after a free-kick from the right. Penalties were required and while Fyodor Smolov's Panenka attempt with the first effort was foiled by Subašić, parity was restored when Akinfeev got down to his left to keep out Mateo Kovačić's second kick for Croatia. After Fernandes' failure, Modrić's strike found the net, following touches off Akinfeev's glove and the post. The decisive penalty fell to Ivan Rakitić, who rolled the ball into the bottom-left corner to give Croatia the win.\nRussia became the first country in World Cup history to contest two shoot-outs while hosting the event. There were three headed goals in this match – the most in a World Cup match since Germany's 8–0 win over Saudi Arabia in 2002 (5 headers). Croatia became the second team to win two penalty shootouts at a single World Cup tournament – the other was Argentina in 1990 (against Yugoslavia and Italy). Croatia qualified for the semi-final for the first time since 1998 (their first World Cup tournament).\nFor the first time since 2006 no other country outside from Europe has not able to reach the last 4 best teams in the world with this result.\n&lt;section begin=qf4 /&gt;&lt;section end=qf4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nFor the first time since 1966, all multiple World Cup winners were eliminated before the semi-final stage. This was only the second time that neither Brazil nor Germany were in the last four, the other being the inaugural 1930 tournament. With Uruguay and Brazil eliminated in the quarter-finals, an all-European semi-final line up was completed for the fifth time (after the 1934, 1966, 1982, and 2006 tournaments). This also ensured that a European side would win the World Cup for the fourth tournament in a row.\nFrance vs Belgium.\nThe teams had faced each other in 73 previous matches, including two times in the World Cup, France winning both matches (3–1 in the round of 16 in 1938 and 4–2 in the third place play-off in 1986). Their most recent meeting came in a friendly in 2015, a 4–3 Belgium win.\nEden Hazard twice went close, narrowly missing the target with a low, left-footed drive before seeing a curler with his right deflected over the crossbar by the head of Raphaël Varane. Hugo Lloris' full-length dive kept out a first-time strike on the turn from Toby Alderweireld, while Thibaut Courtois blocked Benjamin Pavard's attempt from a tight angle on the right at the other end. Six minutes after the break, Vincent Kompany's block turned away Olivier Giroud's shot, and Antoine Griezmann's inswinging delivery from the right to the front post was turned in by Samuel Umtiti, who outjumped his marker, Marouane Fellaini, to head beyond Courtois. Dries Mertens's cross from the right flank saw Fellaini narrowly miss the target with a header. Axel Witsel's long-range drive was pushed away by Lloris as France secured their place into the final.\nWith this match, it meant Didier Deschamps managed more games for France at the World Cup than any other previous France manager, overtaking Raymond Domenech and Michel Hidalgo. This was Belgium's first defeat of any kind since a friendly loss against Spain in September 2016. France reached their third World Cup final, also doing so in 1998 and 2006. Only Germany (8) and Italy (6) had reached more among European nations.\n&lt;section begin=sf1 /&gt;&lt;section end=sf1 /&gt;\nCroatia vs England.\nThe teams had faced each other in seven previous matches, which included two matches played in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification, England winning on both occasions (4–1 and 5–1).\nLuka Modrić stopped a Dele Alli run, by fouling him at the edge of the area. Kieran Trippier found the top right corner of the net from the resulting free kick with his right foot. Harry Kane nearly doubled England's lead, but his close range shot deflected off Danijel Subašić's foot and onto the post. After half-time, Ivan Perišić met Šime Vrsaljko's deep cross from the right at head height with a flying, left-footed finish to the left of the net. Soon after, Perišić shot against the right-hand post from the left before Ante Rebić put the rebound into Jordan Pickford's hands. In extra-time, John Stones had a header cleared off the line by Vrsaljko in the 98th minute. Pickford at the other end, denied Mario Mandžukić at point-blank range after the striker met Perišić's cross from the left. But Mandžukić came out on top soon after the break, latching on to Perišić's headed pass on the left and sending a left-footed effort across Pickford to find the bottom-right corner, securing Croatia's entrance into their first ever World Cup final.\nCroatia became the first team to avoid defeat after trailing in three knockout matches at a single World Cup. They became the 13th different nation to reach a World Cup final. Their first since the establishment of the country's team and the former Yugoslav country since Breakup of Yugoslavia in 1989. Trippier became the first player to score a direct free-kick for England at the World Cup since David Beckham in 2006 against Ecuador. Trippier's goal after four minutes and 44 seconds was the fastest goal scored in a World Cup semi-final since 1958 (Vavá after two minutes for Brazil v France) and was England's 12th goal in Russia, their most in a single World Cup. Croatia became the first team to play extra time in three consecutive World Cup matches since England in 1990. England scored nine goals from set-pieces at the 2018 World Cup – the most by a team in a single World Cup tournament since 1966.\n&lt;section begin=sf2 /&gt;&lt;section end=sf2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\nBelgium and England had previously met in 22 matches, including three matches at the World Cup, one round of 16 game at the 1990 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 1–0 victory for England, one group stage game at the 1954 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 4–4 draw and their most recent encounter in Group G of this tournament which Belgium won 1–0. As both were European teams, this was already set pre-match as the 10th consecutive World Cup in which European teams finished third, stretching back to 1982.\nAfter four minutes, Thomas Meunier raced into the box to get across Danny Rose and tucked home Nacer Chadli's low cross in from the left from six yards out. Harry Kane scuffed wide of the left post, from a Raheem Sterling lay-off. In the 70th minute, Eric Dier burst through for a one-on-one and dinked over Thibaut Courtois, only to see a retreating Toby Alderweireld hack the ball off the line. Jordan Pickford made a one-handed save to deny Meunier in the 80th minute. Eden Hazard scored the second with a near-post finish with his right foot, having been sent clean through by Kevin De Bruyne.\nMeunier was the 10th player to score for Belgium at the 2018 World Cup. No other team had more, equalling France in 1982 and Italy in 2006. This became Belgium's best finish at a World Cup, having previously finished fourth in 1986. This was England's 100th match at a major tournament – 69 at the World Cup and 31 at the European Championship. Since 1966, no player had been involved in more World Cup goals for Belgium than Hazard (seven – three goals and four assists), level with Jan Ceulemans (also four goals and three assists).\n&lt;section begin=tpp /&gt;&lt;section end=tpp /&gt;\nFinal.\nThe match was the sixth meeting between France and Croatia, with France undefeated in the previous fixtures with three wins and two draws. The two sides first met in the 1998 World Cup semi-final, with hosts France winning 2–1. Their only other competitive meeting was during the group stage of Euro 2004, which finished as a 2–2 draw. Their next and most recent meeting was in a March 2011 friendly match, which finished as a 0–0 draw."

        "title": "High Point Panthers women's volleyball",
        "text": "The High Point Panthers women's volleyball team is an NCAA Division I volleyball team representing High Point University as part of the Big South Conference. They play their home games at Millis Athletic Convocation Center in High Point, North Carolina.\nHistory.\nHigh Point University created a volleyball team in 1973, with the Panthers joining the present-day Conference Carolinas, where they played until the 1997 academic year. The Panthers competed only in the NAIA until 1992, had dual membership with the NAIA and Division II in 1993–1994, and moved up to exclusively Division II in 1995. The program had a spate of successful seasons from 1975 to 1980, winning six straight conference titles and peaking with 42 wins in back-to-back years in 1977–1978. However, the NAIA did not begin sponsoring women's volleyball championships until 1980, and the AIAW did not invite them to its volleyball championship. High Point made the NAIA tournament four times: 1982, 1983, 1986, and 1988. The NAIA volleyball championship has a round-robin format, and the Panthers went 2–12 in their four appearances in the 1980s. In Division II, the Panthers won back-to-back conference championships in the Carolinas-Virginia Athletics Conference in 1995–1996. However, this did not result in any NCAA tournament appearances, as the league was a fledgling member of Division II.\nThe High Point Panthers moved up to Division I and joined the Big South Conference in 1999, and the volleyball team encountered struggles in its first few seasons, losing 27+ games each year from 1999 to 2003. However, head coach Chad Esposito was able to build the program up to 24 wins in 2007 and 26 wins in 2008, winning the team's only shared regular-season championship to date in 2008. The Panthers fell 3–2 to Coastal Carolina in the Big South tournament semifinals that year.\nThe Panthers were coached by Jason Oliver from 2009 to 2015, and his tenure was highlighted by a conference tournament championship in 2010, where they swept top-seeded Liberty in the final. The Panthers drew No. 12 Duke in the first round, and lost 25–12, 25–20, 25–20.\nCurrent head coach Tom Mendoza was hired in 2016, bringing a history of success with him. Mendoza had previously coached at Creighton, leading the Blue Jays to a 142–57 record in six seasons from 2010 to 2015, five NCAA Tournament bids, and a Sweet 16 appearance in 2015. In his first season at High Point, Mendoza guided the Panthers to a 23–10 record and the program's second Big South conference tournament title, a 3–1 triumph against top-seeded Radford. The Panthers faced No. 7 North Carolina in the NCAA tournament, falling 25–13, 25–12, 25–23. 2017 was the team's most successful in the Division I era in terms of RPI, as the team reached as high as 44 by the end of the season. After a 5–6 start to the season, including four losses to top-50 RPI teams, the Panthers won 19 straight matches, becoming the first team in Big South history to go 16–0 in conference, while only conceding 4 sets in conference play. The Panthers handed their rivals Radford two of the Highlanders' four losses in the regular season, but in the conference tournament championship, held at Radford, the Highlanders avenged the regular season losses and the previous championship in a 3–1 victory. However, the Panthers were surprisingly picked as an at-large bid for the NCAA Tournament due to their final RPI of 39. They traveled to Salt Lake City to take on Purdue. The Panthers won the first set 25-21 before dropping the next three to finish the season 24–8.\nIndividual awards.\nBig South Rookie of the Year\nBig South Coach of the Year\nBig South Tournament MVP\nBig South Scholar-Athlete of the Year\nPostseason Results.\nThe Panthers have appeared in 3 NCAA tournaments and 4 NAIA tournaments. Their all-time record is 2–15."

They are currently ranked second in the world by World Lacrosse and have won Silver medals in all four World Indoor Lacrosse Championships. The team is organized by the First Nations Lacrosse Association.\nIn June of 2022, the Nationals dropped Iroquois from their name, adopting the name the Haudenosaunee Nationals.\nWorld Indoor Lacrosse Championship.\n2003.\nIn the first World Indoor Lacrosse Championship, the Nationals only lost to Canada, but twice, a close 15–13 game in round-robin play and a blowout 21–4 loss in the championship. John Grant Jr. of Team Canada scored 7 goals and 2 assists in the final.\n2007.\nThe 2007 WILC final, with the expected pairing of Canada against the Nationals, was one of the best games in box lacrosse history. Team Canada went through the first quarter with a 4–2 lead, then the Nationals were able to come back in the second and third. The Iroquois were up 10-9 at the start of the fourth quarter. Three quick Canadian goals put them in front again, but they were answered by another three goals by the Nationals. Then John Grant, Jr. scored two goals and the victory for Canada was almost secured. But Dean Hill scored in the final minute of regulation to tie it at 14, sending the championship into overtime. Thirty seconds into overtime, Jeff Zywicki scored his first goal of the game, making it 15–14 for Canada's second gold medal.\n2011.\nCanada beat the Nationals in the final for the third time in 2011. Starting goaltender Mike Thompson was injured in the second quarter and had to be replaced by Angus Goodleaf. Cody Jamieson and Sid Smith and were named to the All World Team.

        "text": "The Haudenosaunee Nationals Men’s Lacrosse Team, formerly known as the Iroquois Nationals, represents the Iroquois Confederacy in international field lacrosse competition. They are currently ranked third in the world by World Lacrosse after winning Bronze at the 2018 World Lacrosse Championship. \nIn June 2022, the Nationals dropped Iroquois from their name, adopting the name the Haudenosaunee Nationals.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nLacrosse was originally played as part of a spiritual endeavour meant to praise and give thanks to the Creator, a tradition still followed today by the Haudenosaunee Nationals. For example, before each game the Haudenosaunee Nationals gather around their spiritual advisor who leads a traditional tobacco-burning rite, in addition to other rituals in an effort to prepare players before they take the field. The traditions attached to lacrosse extend to the wooden sticks, central to the Iroquois religion and culture. Specifically, males are given a miniature wooden lacrosse stick at birth, sleep with their stick nearby throughout their life, and even take one to the grave. It is believed that the first thing a Haudenosaunee does after reaching the afterlife is grab the stick placed in his coffin. The importance given to these wooden lacrosse sticks stem from the belief that these are gifts from Mother Earth. The Haudenosaunee believe that, because a living organism (i.e. a tree) died to make the stick, its spirit has been transferred to the stick's owner. Therefore, the Haudenosaunee play humbly in an attempt to honour the tree's sacrifice.\nModern team.\nThe Iroquois Nationals men's lacrosse team was formed and sanctioned by the Grand Council of the Haudenosaunee in 1983 in preparation of friendlies at the NCAA championship in Baltimore, Maryland. The Nationals lost to the Syracuse Orangemen 28-5 and the Hobart Statesmen 22-14. Prior to the 1984 Summer Olympics, the Nationals held the Jim Thorpe Memorial Games and Pow-Wow, a 6-team event with local and international teams in Los Angeles. The nationals achieved their first victory over the national team of England. The following year, using their Haudenosaunee passports, the Nationals traveled and toured England losing only once.\nThe Iroquois Nationals team is the only First Nation's team with international recognition as a sovereign people. After being denied membership by the International Lacrosse Federation (ILF) to compete in the 1986 World Lacrosse Championship in Canada, the Iroquois hosted the teams for preliminary games at the University at Buffalo. The IFL accepted the Iroquois as a full member nation in 1988.\nThe Iroquois Nationals took part in their first international competition at the 1990 World Lacrosse Championship in Australia, finishing fifth out of five teams. They warmed up for the world championship by competing in the Lacrosse USA tournament in Syracuse against top men's club teams.\nIn 2002, the Iroquois Nationals were recognized with an Honoring Nations award for demonstrating nation building through traditional sports. The Honoring Nations award program is administered by the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development.\nWomen's team.\nAlthough holding cultural importance among Iroquois communities, lacrosse has been described primarily as a men's game. After the recognition of the male lacrosse team in the 1980s, a group of female Haudenosaunee lacrosse players attempted to create a national women's team. However, Haudenosaunee leaders refused to sanction a women's team citing traditional and cultural restrictions. Despite this, lacrosse remained vital to the national identity of Haudenosaunee women. Ultimately, the Haudenosaunee women were able to form a national team, becoming members of the FIL in 2008.\nNike deal.\nHistorically, the Iroquois Nationals operated on a very small budget while simultaneously trying not to accept any financial resources from the Canadian and American governments in an attempt to assert their sovereignty through financial independence.\nIn 2006, the Iroquois Nationals Lacrosse Program signed a partnership with Nike, Inc. in which Nike will provide the Nationals with their brand uniforms, clothing, footwear, and other equipment. The company is to develop programs to \"promote wellness-and-fitness activities in Native American communities throughout the region\", and team members may go to speak to local groups. Team members will also assist in testing of sustainable produced sportswear for Nike's research and development of processes to use non-toxic dyes and biodegradable organic cotton.\nNike is the only Fortune 500 company to have such a relationship with a First Nations organization, and the Iroquois Nationals are the only such group. This partnership extends beyond simply providing equipment and apparel and includes programs to promote wellness and fitness among Native American communities. This focus on the promotion of physical activity among Native Americans is part of Nike's Native American Business Program; they have worked with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service to establish and manage physical activity programs among Native American communities. These programs are particularly important given the disproportionately high rates of obesity and diabetes among Indigenous communities.\nPassport issues.\nThe Iroquois Confederacy began issuing their own passports in 1927 and its holders were able to travel without problem for many years. However, with stricter security measures following the 9/11 terrorist attack, the European Union member states no longer recognized these passports as legal travel documents. While holders of these passports were still able to enter Canada, neither the United States nor Canada recognized the passports as valid travel documents.\nThese passports became an issue when the Iroquois Nationals attempted to enter England for the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship held in Manchester. The Nationals were unable to attend and compete in the 2010 World Lacrosse Championship in England as the United Kingdom did not accept their Iroquois passports. The Nationals’ players were told by British officials to obtain either U.S. or Canadian passports if they wished to enter the country, as the team's 23 players were eligible to be issued passports from these countries. The Iroquois Nationals refused to travel with Canadian or American passports, arguing that this would be a strike against their identity. As a result, the Nationals were forced to forfeit their three preliminary games. In 2018, the Iroquois Nationals’ travel arrangements to Israel for the World Lacrosse Championship were delayed due to passport issues once again. However, after the intervention of the Federation of International Lacrosse and the local organizing committee, the Israeli and Canadian governments were able to resolve the issue and lift the travel restrictions. As a result, the Iroquois Nationals arrived just before the opening ceremonies and their first game.\n2028 Summer Olympics.\nIn October of 2023, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) officially added lacrosse to the 2028 Summer Olympics held in Los Angeles, California. Whether the Haudenosaunee Nationals—a team not representing a member nation in the IOC—would be allowed to compete as a team in the Olympics remains a point of contention. The team has received support from both U.S. President Joe Biden and Canadian Sport Minister Carla Qualtrough, but the IOC has stated that only countries with a National Olympic Committee (NOC) would be allowed to compete, and that it would be up to the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and the Canadian Olympic Committee (COC) to allow Haudenosaunee players to play in their respective teams."

The Gophers were led by fifth-year head coach Richard Pitino and played their home games at Williams Arena in Minneapolis, Minnesota as members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 15–17, 4–14 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for 11th place.

In the Big Ten tournament, they beat Michigan State in the quarterfinals before losing to Michigan in the semifinals. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 5 seed. The bid marked their first trip to the Tournament since 2013. In the first round, they were upset by No. 12-seeded Middle Tennessee.\nHead coach Richard Pitino was named Big Ten Coach of the Year. Reggie Lynch was named defensive player of the year. Nate Mason was named to the All-Big Ten First Team.\nPreseason.\nIn its annual preseason preview, the Blue Ribbon Yearbook ranked Minnesota No. 18 in the country.\nRegular season.\nAlabama game - playing five on three.\nOne of their most notable games of the season came on November 25, 2017 against No. 25 Alabama. During that game, Alabama's bench players left the bench to scuffle with Minnesota players midway through the second half. Because the players left the bench, every one of the players was ejected leaving Alabama with only five eligible players. Not long after the scuffle, Alabama's Dazon Ingram fouled out with 11:37 left in the game, which left Alabama with only four players. Shortly thereafter, Alabama's John Petty turned his ankle and was unable return for the rest of the game, leaving Alabama with only three players with 10:41 left in the match. While Minnesota was up by as many as 15 points under three-on-five competition, their lead diminished to as little as three points at one point due, in part, to Collin Sexton's 40-point game. However, the Golden Gophers would ultimately win 89–84 over the short-handed Crimson Tide. The game would be considered one of the strangest games in college basketball history.\nReggie Lynch suspension.\nOn January 5, 2018, Reggie Lynch was suspended from the University of Minnesota due to multiple sexual assault allegations that had occurred in 2016. The school's Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action Office suspended Lynch from the University until 2020. Lynch appealed the finding and cannot play in any games, but was allowed to practice with the team.\nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018 Big Ten tournament will be held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Due to the Big East's use of that venue for their conference tournament, the Big Ten tournament will take place one week earlier than usual, ending the week before Selection Sunday. The Gophers were initially slated to hold only one public exhibition game against Concordia-St. Paul, in addition to a closed scrimmage against Creighton. However, in response to the devastation from hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, the NCAA announced that it would allow Division I basketball teams to apply for a waiver to play a third exhibition game if the proceeds were donated to charity. The Gophers took advantage of the opportunity, scheduling an additional exhibition game against Wisconsin-Green Bay. The game was scheduled to be played at Maturi Pavilion, with all proceeds being donated to the American Red Cross hurricane relief efforts in Puerto Rico.\n! colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n! colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n! colspan=\"9\" style=|Big Ten tournament"

        "text": "Mark Dean (October 20, 1917 – April 5, 2006) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Austin Junior College (1946–1947), Superior State Teacher's College (1948–1950) and Indiana State University (1951–1954, 1956).\nPlaying career.\nDean played football as a halfback at Northern Illinois University from 1935 through 1937; in addition, he spent one season as a member of the Huskies JV basketball team.\nCoaching career.\nDean began his coaching career in 1938 in West Des Moines, Iowa; after four years, he then moved on to Roodhouse High School in Roodhouse, Illinois, tallying a mark of 8–0, winning the 1942 conference title. He moved on to Jacksonville High School in Jacksonville, Illinois for the 1943 season and led the Crimson to a record of 4–4–1. From 1944 to 1945, Dean was a member of the U.S. Navy and coached the 16th Fleet basketball team.\nFollowing World War II, Dean accepted the head coaching position at Austin Junior College, he led the Blue Devils to two winning seasons and the Minnesota Junior College Athletic Association title before resigning to accept the same position at Superior State Teacher's College, continuing to climb the coaching ladder; Dean accepted the head coaching job at Indiana State University; he held the position from 1951 to 1954, and the 1956 season.\nDean resigned after the 1956–57 academic year to return to his alma mater as an assistant to Howard Fletcher; he spent the next eight seasons helping to build a highly successful program; the Huskies won Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (IIAC) titles in 1963 and 1964 and the AP National Championship (College Division) in 1963. Following the graduation of his son Jack in 1964, Dean resigned from coaching but continued to serve as an administrator until the early 1980s.\nIndiana State.\nDean accepted the Indiana State job in 1951, following the resignation of George Ashworth. He promised a diverse offense, utilized the T, split-T, and the single-wing, but said ultimately, his system would fit the talent of team. During his five-year tenure, he compiled an Indiana Collegiate Conference (ICC) record of 6–17–3 and an overall record of 15–20–4. His record in homecoming games was 1–4. He was named the ICC Coach of the Year for the 1952 season, arguably his most successful season at Indiana State. He spent the 1955 season on a leave of absence to complete his Ph.D. but returned to the coaching ranks for the 1956 season. More than five of his players were selected All-Conference during his tenure.\nNorthern Illinois.\nIn 1957, Dean chose to join the Northern Illinois staff led by head coach Howard Fletcher's staff as a line coach; assisting in one of the best eras in that school's sports history. The Huskies success eventually led to NCAA Division I-FBS status, the 'new' Huskie Stadium, and membership in the Mid-American Conference---all within the decade of the Associated Press and NAIA national titles, and Mineral Water Bowl appearance in 1963.\nDean taught undergraduate and graduate courses for the university; served as the coordinator of student affairs, and directed student teaching at Northern Illinois.\nIn 1978, he was elected president of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education.\nLastly, he was the public address announcer at Chick Evans Field House for men's basketball and men's gymnastics.\nFamily.\nDean is the father of fellow Northern Illinois University Hall of Famer Jack Dean (1961–1964). The one-time holder of the school's career all-purpose yardage record (3,668 yards), Dean, played halfback and quarterback for Fletcher, was named the Interstate Intercollegiate Athletic Conference Player of the Year honors as a senior, and pursued professional football with the Washington Redskins, Pittsburgh Steelers, and Edmonton Eskimos."

        "title": "Horse racing in Ireland",
        "text": "Horse racing in Ireland is intricately linked with Irish culture and society. The racing of horses has a long history on the island, being mentioned in some of the earliest texts. Domestically, racing is one of Ireland's most popular spectator sports, while on the international scene, Ireland is one of the strongest producers and trainers of Thoroughbred horses. The Irish horse racing industry is closely linked with that of Great Britain, with Irish horses regularly competing and winning on the British racing circuit.\nHistory.\nEarliest records.\nHorse racing in Ireland has a very long history. The ancient text \"Togail Bruidne Dá Derga\" (Destruction of the Mansion of Da-Derga) mentions chariot races taking place on the Curragh during the lifetime of the monarch Conaire Mór, whose reign is disputed but is believed to have occurred sometime between 110 BC and 60 AD. The use of the Curragh as an early location for horse racing is also mentioned in a gloss to the 7th century \"Liber Hymnorum\". The mythological Fianna were said to have enjoyed horse racing without the use of chariots; the Book of Leinster contains an early poem mentioning races at the Curragh and near Croom, as well as a tradition of racing on the beach in Kerry, a tradition which continues today. There are later mentions of \"horse matches\" in Galway in the 13th century under the \"Kings Plate Articles\".\nThe earliest datable evidence, however, is a 1603 royal warrant entitling the governor of Derry to hold fairs and markets at which horse races could be staged. Horse racing was evidently popular in the 17th century: a 1622 poem tells of a jockey killed participating in a horse race in Carrickfergus, while other accounts mention a 1634 race between Lord Digby and the Earl of Ormond, and the establishment in 1682 of a race by Lord Kildare, with a plate of 40 pounds to the winner. In a correspondence to King Charles II in 1673, Sir William Temple stated \"Horses in Ireland are a drug... we see horses bred of excellent shape, and vigour, and size, so as to reach great prices at home, and encourage strangers to find the market here.\"\nEstablishment of the sport.\nRacing became more competitive with the introduction, in 1666, under King Charles II, of the King's Plate Races, designed so as to favour a fast yet strong horse, capable of winning a 4-mile race with a weight load of 12 stone. The winning horses were much sought after for breeding, leading to rapid improvement of the breed, with horses not in the winnings still capable hunters. The Curragh was awarded its plate in the 1670s, followed by the establishment in 1685 of a studbook under the Down Royal Corporation of Horse Breeders to promote the breeding of racehorses. The introduction of the Penal Laws, restricting Catholics to owning horses of a value less than £5, did little to deter horse owners, resulting in races limited to horses of that value. Race meetings were increasingly advertised in the press, and by 1750 even the English \"Racing Calendar\" advertised some 71 Irish events.\nThe origin of the Steeplechase was a 4.5 mile match race between Buttevant and Doneraile, County Cork, across natural countryside, beginning and ending at the eponymous steeples of each of the towns. The race, ran between locals Edmund Blake and Cornelius O'Callaghan, started a trend of racing cross-country, in a manner derived from fox hunting, with a prize replacing the quarry - a cask of wine in the original race. The early steeplechases offered little more than an agreed-upon landmarks as start and finish points, with the riders free to choose their own path, but later races used a line of flags to indicate a determined course. In the 1830s, artificial courses were laid out in numerous locations, in a similar fashion to flat racing courses, with weight allowances based on the age of the animal, a predecessor to today's National Hunt.\nA regulatory body was initially set up as \"the Society of Sportsmen\", changing its name to \"The Jockey Club\" by 1755, before taking on its present name of \"The Turf Club\" in 1784. Although an independent body, on occasion it referred disputes to the English Jockey Club. A similar body for National Hunt races, the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee, was formed under the Turf Club to ensure fair running of National Hunt meetings.\nThe first recorded race meet at Laytown took place in 1868, at a time when beach races were a relatively common occurrence. The first racing festival at the Ballybrit racecourse took place in the following year, with a reported 40,000 spectators in attendance.\nIn the mid-19th century, the racehorse industry saw a decline linked to the aftermath of the Napoleonic wars. Economic strife led to less investment in horse breeding, and capable horses were more likely to be raced in England where the prize money was larger. However, with the expansion of the Irish rail network, racecourses sprung up in new locations, with such large numbers travelling by train to race meetings that railway companies began offering free travel to competing horses.\n20th century.\nThe First World War didn't initially see the cancellation of horse racing, and Thoroughbreds did not feature prominently among the 300,000 horses. Although the 1916 Rising resulted a 6-week ban on race meetings, they continued shortly afterwards. Horse racing was temporarily banned on 4 May 1917, following complaints concerning the oat intake of Thoroughbreds. The ban led to public outcry, especially in Ireland where some 20,000 people were believed to be employed in the embattled racing industry. Fearing further unrest, the British government gave a concession to allow the Curragh festival of 8–10 May, finally relenting on 20 June. In 1915, the British National Stud was based in the Curragh, becoming the Irish National Stud after independence.\nIn the post-independence period, many efforts were made to regulate and support the horse racing industry in Ireland, and a greater effort was made to promote Irish horses internationally. As early as 1926, the Irish Free State legislated to allow off-course betting, and the Tote was introduced in 1930 to raise funds for the industry. The Emergency that accompanied the Second World War was reportedly beneficial to horse racing, as restrictions on foreign and motor travel led to an increase in spectator numbers. The Irish Racing Board, the predecessor to Horse Racing Ireland, was set up in 1945 to oversee the economics of the industry, followed by the Irish Horse Authority in 1995 and Horse Racing Ireland in 2001.\nMeasures introduced by these organisations have helped the industry go from strength to strength. The Irish horse racing industry is today worth €1 billion per annum, employs over 14,000 people, and is a major player on the international scene.\nTypes of racing.\nFlat.\nIn Ireland, the Flat racing season runs from mid-March to mid-November, and comprises races started from stalls, run over 5 to 20 furlongs. These races are held at 23 racecourses, of which 3 run only Flat.\nNational Hunt.\nNational Hunt racing, or Jump racing, is run year-round in Ireland, but the main season takes place from November until the end of April, coinciding with the lull of the flat racing season. Run over a minimum of 2 miles, National Hunt races require the horses to clear a number of obstacles.\nThere are three types of National Hunt race:\nSteeplechase and Hurdle races are held each year at 23 courses, of which 3 run exclusively National Hunt races.\nOther.\nA number of other types of horse racing take place in Ireland, including Harness racing and Endurance racing.\nRacecourses.\nThere are 26 major racecourses in Ireland, more per head of population than any other country, with more than 350 race meetings and 2,000 races annually. More than 1.3m people visit Irish racecourses each year, with crowds in excess of 100,000 annually attending both the Punchestown Festival in April, and the Galway Races in July. The majority of racecourses are turf, with Dundalk being the only floodlit all-weather polytrack. Laytown holds the distinction of being the only beach racecourse in the country adhering to the rules of the Turf Club, with one race meeting held each year on a natural sand track; however unaffiliated beach races are frequently held on beaches in some parts of the country.\nList of major Irish racecourses.\nHorse Racing Ireland recognises the following racecourses:\nUlster\nMunster\nLeinster\nConnacht\nRaces have previously been held under the Rules of Racing at a number of other locations. Races were held at Tralee until 2008, when the course was sold for redevelopment. Unaffiliated races are frequently held at many locations throughout the country.\nMajor festivals.\nThe main races in the Irish horseracing calendar are the Irish Derby, the Irish Champion Stakes, the Irish Oaks, the Irish 1,000 Guineas and the Irish 2,000 Guineas. The minimum prize money per race in Ireland is currently (2017) set at €9,000, with the highest average prize money per race in Europe. In 2016, the total prize money awarded was €56.8 million.\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAugust\nSeptember\nNovember\nDecember\nIrish Thoroughbred breeding.\nThoroughbred breeding is an important economic activity in Ireland. There are over 43,000 Thoroughbreds in Ireland, 35% of the country's equine population; there are more horses per head of population than in any other European country. More than 80% of these Irish-bred Thoroughbreds are exported to 37 countries, generating an estimated €229 million per year; nearly 80% of these exports are to Great Britain. Ireland is the largest producer of Thoroughbreds in the EU, producing 40% of the EU's Thoroughbreds, and the fourth-largest in the world; additionally, 4 of the top 10 stallions in Europe are based in Ireland.\nIt has been suggested that the success of Irish Thoroughbreds, both at home and abroad, is partly due to its climate and geography; the wet, temperate climate and limestone-rich soil encourages the growth of calcium-containing grass, while the mild temperatures and lack of seasonal variability allow year-round grazing.\nHorse racing in Irish society.\nIreland is seen by many as a \"horse nation\". A recurring part of Irish culture, the horse has been romanticised in art and literature for many centuries. In particular, the Thoroughbred, and horse racing in general, is seen as one of the country's main traditions:\nThoroughbred breeding in Ireland is intricately linked with Irish rural life and community. Horse breeding and training is a key economic player in regions of the country where there are few employment opportunities. Horse race attendance is a strong contributor to tourism, with approximately 80,000 people travelling to Ireland annually to attend racing events.\nKey entities.\nJockeys.\nDennis Fitzpatrick was the first professional Irish jockey to race in England, particularly noted for taking part in match races towards the turn of the 19th century, beginning a long history of professional Irish jockeys in the United Kingdom.\nIn Ireland it is not uncommon for jockeys to ride in both National Hunt and Flat races, however, the weight allowance for Flat is lower than that of National Hunt. A valid Flat or National Hunt licence must be held to ride in either type of race. Point-to-point races are open only to non-professional jockeys, who must register as \"Qualified Riders\" but need not meet the requirements for Flat or National Hunt licences.\nTrainers.\nThe Turf Club is responsible for licensing trainers. There are over 700 licensed trainers in the country, the majority of which are licensed to train horses for both Flat and National Hunt, although they usually specialise in one. For the duration of its training, the horse is stabled with the trainer, who is responsible for its general upkeep, as well as training.\nOwners and breeders.\nIn Ireland, racehorses may be owned solely, in partnership or in syndicate. Roughly 8,000 Thoroughbreds are born each year, with 20% of the yearly foal crop publicly auctioned by bloodstock auction houses, such as Tattersalls and Goffs. They may also be sold directly by trainers, breeders or agents. Racehorse owners are the largest source of income to the Irish racehorse industry, contributing over €400 million each year.\nThere are over 6,000 registered breeders in the country, 93% of which have fewer than 5 broodmares.\nOrganisations.\nHorse racing organisations are funded through a number of sources, including membership fees, taxation of betting, a foal registration levy, profits from the Tote, and direct contribution from the Government of the Republic of Ireland.\nHorse Racing Ireland (HRI) was established in 2001 in an effort to promote Irish Horse racing and Thoroughbred breeding at an international level. The HRI has a number of responsibilities, including the management of the national Thoroughbred studbooks (registration with Weatherbys is also a requirement for all Irish Throughbreds), the development and operation of a number of racecourses, and the authorisation of bookmaking and funding. It is a member of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, the European and Mediterranean Federation of Horseracing Authorities and the European Pattern Committee.\nThe Turf Club, established in 1790, is the regulatory body for Horse racing in Ireland, including both Flat and National Hunt racing, and incorporates the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee (INHSC). One of the main functions is the provision of stewards to implement Rules of Racing during races. In January 2018 a new organisation, the Irish Horseracing Regulatory Board, will become the regulatory body for horse racing in Ireland.\nThe Irish Thoroughbred Breeders' Association (ITBA) represents the Thoroughbred breeding industry both in Ireland and abroad, and is involved with a number of industry bodies. Its activities also include the monitoring of equine diseases and dissemination of veterinary information to its members.\nThe Irish Racehorse Trainers Association (IRTA) was founded in 1950 to represent licensed racehorse trainers in Ireland and, today, has a membership of almost 430 individuals.\nThe Association of Irish Racehorse Owners (AIRO) is the official representative body for racehorse owners in Ireland, and has over 1,900 members.\nThe Association of Irish Racecourse Owners (AIR) was established in 1964 to further the interests of racecourses and represent their owners. Its membership comprises all Irish racecourses.\nThe Irish Jockeys Association (IJA) represents jockeys in the industry, and is notable for running, in association with the Turf Club, the Irish Jockey's Trust, which supports jockeys and former jockeys in difficulty.\nThe Irish Stablestaff Association (ISSA) lobbies for improved working conditions and pay for stable staff."

        "title": "Tennis polo",
        "text": "Tennis polo (or toccer) is a field sport where two teams of ten players (nine field players and one goalkeeper) use a tennis ball to score goals by throwing the ball into a goal defended by a keeper who holds a racket. Tennis polo shares elements of sports such as field handball, hurling, football, and lacrosse. The game may also be played where all field players have racquets including the goalkeeper.\nThe sport is interchangeably referred to as \"tennis polo\" or \"toccer\". There are players in 18 countries including Canada, Mexico, United States, Italy, and France.\nAdapted to be a fast-paced sport with little stoppage of play, players advance the ball by throwing or kicking within the field of play.\nEquipment.\nTennis polo goalkeepers use rackets similar to those used in tennis. Only goalkeepers are allowed racquets, but any player can serve as goalkeeper, but no player acting as goalkeeper can leave the 11-yard box with a racquet.\nField of play.\nThe sport is played on a grass field between 80 and 100 yards long and 50 to 65 yards wide. The goal area is a semicircular line with an 11-yard radius and the penalty mark at 13 yards from the goal. An experimental rule has a second semicircular line on the field with a 17-yard radius. Generally, a field for gridiron football or soccer can be used.\nLength of a match.\nThe match length is variable, but sanctioned matches are divided into two halves of 20 minutes. If matches are tied, an extra 20-minute period is played. If the score remains tied at the end of a tournament match, the game is decided by throws from the penalty mark (13 yards from the goal), but players are allowed to run anywhere between the midfield line and penalty mark before throwing the ball and have five seconds in which to take their shot.\nGame play.\nEach half of the game begins with a jump ball by a referee at midfield.\nThe ball can be advanced by throwing it or kicking it. When a player has the ball in their possession, they can run with it for up to three steps (or five seconds) before being required to either pass it or attempt a shot on goal.\nOffensive players cannot attempt shots on goal from within the penalty area (referred to as the \"layer\") and any goals scored from within the layer are invalid. Defensive players may defend from within the layer, as well as the racket keeper.\nSubstitutions.\nTeams make unlimited substitutions and substitutes enter play without stoppage of play (as in ice hockey and some varieties of indoor soccer).\nTurnovers.\nWhen the ball is turned over because it goes out of bounds, the clock is not stopped. Instead, the ball is retrieved (or in most cases, a new ball given to the opposing player) and the game resumes. If the ball is intentionally thrown out of bounds, it's referred to as wasting and the penalized team is assessed a penalty depending on the severity, which may include extended time at the discretion of the referee.\nPlayer positions.\nThe standard 10-team formation consists of two layer defenders, one strong back, a deep wing, one middle receiver, three strikers and a goalkeeper. Some teams opt for different variations of player formations, but no more than 10 players (including a goalkeeper) are allowed on the field at a time.\nPenalties.\nMost games are officiated by a head referee and two umpires at each end of the field. Players are assessed penalties for infractions such as holding, carrying the ball too long without passing or attempting a shot on goal, interference or goal keepers running outside of the layer with the racket in-hand.\nScoring.\nScoring occurs when the ball is hit (or kicked) into the goal. Each goal is worth one point. Goals scored outside of the 17-yard arc are worth two points and those scored in front of the 13-yard arc are worth one point.\nOffensive players are not allowed to be in front of the ball in order for two-point goals to count. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins the match.\nHistory.\nIn 2004, the Tennis Director at Camp Awosting in Lakeside, Connecticut, Ron Bronson, created the sport of toccer as a diversion for his tennis players during a rainy summer. The outdoor tennis courts were largely unusable, so Bronson came up with a series of elaborate tennis hybrid games that could be played indoors or on grass fields. The most popular of these games was toccer, which is a combination of tennis and soccer. At the insistence of his campers and with their help, Bronson devised the first written rules of the sport later that summer.\nIn 2010, the rules were modified dramatically at Windridge Camp at Teela-Wooket in Roxbury, Vermont. Players there discovered the sport and modified the rules to allow only goalkeepers to carry rackets. In this modified format, field players advance the ball by throwing it across the field (and into the goal.) After a year of experimental rules testing, the governing body of Tennis Polo, the Tennis Polo Players Association (TPA), codified the Vermont format as the official format of toccer.\nTennis Polo is the first field sport known to be invented by an African-American. The only other sport known to have been created by an African-American is Steer wrestling."

        "text": "Taylor Matthew Davis (born November 28, 1989) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates.\nCareer.\nAmateur.\nDavis attended Jupiter High School in Jupiter, Florida.

While also playing in Iowa, Taylor had an uncanny ability to find the correct camera at all times.\nDavis was called up to the majors for the first time on September 4, 2017. On September 14, 2017, Davis recorded his first major league hit on a slow roller up the third base line. He finished his rookie year going 3-for-13 with 1 RBI in 8 appearances. Davis was non-tendered by the Cubs on December 1 and became a free agent.\nDavis re-signed with the Cubs on a minor league contract on December 21, 2017. He began the year with Iowa, batting .275/.348/.360 in 107 games. He had his contract purchased on September 1, 2018, and went 2-for-5 in 5 games. On May 4, 2019 Davis hit first career home run, a game tying grand slam off of the St. Louis Cardinals' Michael Wacha. He became the seventh player in MLB history to hit a tying grand slam for his first homer. He also became the third Cubs player to have his first homer be a grand slam. Davis only played in 7 games with Chicago in 2019, going 3-for-18, before he was designated for assignment, and cleared waivers on September 10, 2019. On November 4, he elected free agency.\nBaltimore Orioles.\nOn January 23, 2020, Davis signed a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles that included an invitation to Spring Training. Davis did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On October 29, 2020, Davis re-signed with the Orioles on a new minor league contract. Davis was assigned to the Triple-A Norfolk Tides to begin the 2021 season. In 12 games with the club, he posted a .289/.372/.368 slash line with 5 RBI.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nOn June 15, 2021, Davis was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Jose Berroa. Davis had 5 at-bats in 2021, getting 2 hits. On November 16, Davis was released by the Pirates. \nOn March 11, 2022, Davis re-signed with the Pirates on a minor league contract that included an invitation to spring training. On August 5, Davis was designated for assignment. He cleared waivers and was sent outright to the Triple-A Indianapolis Indians on August 7. He elected free agency following the season on October 6.\nCoaching career.\nOn January 22, 2024, the Pirates organization hired Davis to serve as the catching and game–planning coach for their Double–A affiliate, the Altoona Curve."

        "text": "Harry H. Short (April 16, 1878 in Plymouth, Indiana – November 20, 1954 in Garden City, Kansas) was a minor league baseball player and manager. He played on two Texas League championship Austin Senators teams (in 1906 and 1907), and led the league in stolen bases in 1907 with 78.\nPlaying career.\nShort grew up in Concordia, Kansas; his younger brother was Clyde Short who would go on to become Chairman of the Kansas Democratic Party.\nHarry Short attended Kansas State Normal College and played shortstop on the college team. After subsequently playing on semi-professional teams in Concordia, where he became known for his strong fielding and speed, he entered minor league baseball in 1904 with a team in New Bern, North Carolina. In 1905 he played for the Minneapolis Minnies of the Kansas State League. In 1906, he was recruited by, and played third base (and other positions) for, the Austin Senators, who were part of the South Texas League that year. The 1906 Senators won their league championship by default when the Houston Buffaloes refused to stop using non-league players. He remained with the Senators in 1907, a year in which he led the league in stolen bases with 78 and won another league championship.\nDuring 1907, the Senators would post one of the most lopsided victories in baseball history, by defeating the San Antonio Bronchos in the second game of a doubleheader 44-0. During this game, Short scored seven runs on five hits, stole four bases and hit a double and a triple. He was referred to in articles as \"one of the fastest baserunners and best base-stealers in Texas\", and was also a fan-favorite that year to take over managing the Senators team.\nShort played again for Austin in 1908, then began 1909 with the Houston Buffaloes before being traded to the Waco Navigators for Hub Northen (who would go on to play for the Cincinnati Reds, Brooklyn Dodgers, and St. Louis Browns). In 1910, he left the Texas League for the Central Kansas League, where he became player-manager of the Concordia Travelers. The Travelers won league championships in 1910 and 1911, and during the latter season, the Travelers and Short were accused by the Clay Center Cubs of \"throwing games\" to the Junction City Soldiers, which was hotly debated in opposing newspapers columns in both towns. After the Central Kansas League folded, he continued to play for local Kansas teams until at least 1915.\nManagerial career.\nYear-by-year managerial record.\nDuring his early career as a player-manager, Short's teams were often referred to as \"Short's Boosters\" or \"Short's Travelers\". In his first two managing seasons, he played with and coached Chick Smith and the Travelers won their league championship. After the Central Kansas League folded, Short went on to manage and play for a number of other teams for other baseball leagues throughout Kansas."

        "text": "The 2018 ACC men's basketball tournament was the postseason men's basketball tournament for the Atlantic Coast Conference held at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York from March 6–10, 2018. It was the 65th annual edition of the tournament, and the second year in a row being held at Barclays Center. The Virginia Cavaliers entered the tournament as the top seed, with a 17–1 conference record (28–2 overall) under the guidance of Tony Bennett. UVA also began the tournament unanimously ranked number 1 in the country in both major polls.\nThe Cavaliers defeated Louisville 75–58 and Clemson 64–58 to secure a place in the tournament championship game. They defeated North Carolina 71–63 in the championship game to become tournament champion. Sophomore guard Kyle Guy was named Tournament MVP. Games were shown on over-the-air television in local media markets by the syndicated ACCN and simulcast nationally on various ESPN cable networks.\nBoth the Virginia–North Carolina title game and Duke–North Carolina semifinal game set the Barclays Center attendance record for college basketball games, and conference leadership vowed to return the ACC Tournament to New York in the near future.\nSeeds.\nAll 15 ACC teams participated in the tournament. Teams were seeded by record within the conference, with a tiebreaker system to seed teams with identical conference records. The tournament was held over five consecutive days. Teams ranked 10–15 played on the first day; teams ranked 5–9 entered the bracket on the second day, with teams ranked 1–4 entering on the third day (quarterfinals). The semifinals were played on the fourth day, and the finals on the last day.\nSchedule.\nAll games were televised on the ACC Network within the ACC footprint and simulcast nationally on the ESPN networks denoted below.\nGame summaries.\nFirst round.\nThree games were played in the first round. In all three, the higher seed advanced.\nIn the first game, the 12-seed Boston College Eagles took on the 13-seed Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Boston College got out to a ten-point lead at halftime. They opened the second half on a 15–5 run, bringing their lead to 20 with under 14 minutes to play. A late flurry of scoring by Georgia Tech reduced the Eagles' lead to 6 with only 45 seconds remaining, but BC hit four free throws at the end of the game, ending the chance of a Yellow Jacket comeback. Georgia Tech's Tadric Jackson led all scorers with 29 points in the losing effort.\nThe second game featured the 10-seed Notre Dame Fighting Irish against the 15-seed Pittsburgh Panthers. The game looked to be one of the biggest mismatches in the tournament, with Notre Dame likely post-season bound with a 20-win season and Pittsburgh entering the tournament having lost every conference game and sporting a woeful 8–24 record. Instead, the two teams played the closest game of the first round, with Notre Dame clinging to a two-point lead with less than a minute remaining; however a controversial loose-ball foul against Pitt's Marcus Carr followed by a turnover by Carr allowed Notre Dame to preserve their lead and close out the game 67–64. Carr's late game mistakes were ironic as his three-pointer was the one that cut the Notre Dame lead to two, and he scored 18 in the game, tied with Jared Wilson-Frame to lead the Panthers in scoring. Notre Dame's Bonzie Colson led all scorers with 19.\nThe last game of the day featured the 11-seed Syracuse Orange versus the 14-seed Wake Forest Demon Deacons. Syracuse was playing with a short bench, as several injuries limited their ability to substitute. Despite leading by 19 with under eight minutes to play, the wear on Syracuse's starters showed, as they played all but the last 32 seconds of the second half, and that substitution was forced by Tyus Battle's fifth foul of the game. The Demon Deacons had cut the lead to six with fresher legs, but the Orange held on to win 73–64. Wake Forest's Bryant Crawford led all scoring with 22 points.\nAwards and honors.\nTournament MVP: Kyle Guy\nAll-Tournament Teams:"

The league lasted one season, playing in September and October, 1998.\nHistory.\nMaryland Fall Baseball was the second in a series of attempts by Major League Baseball to establish a second winter league to supplement the Arizona Fall League. In this Maryland Fall Baseball was preceded by Hawaii Winter Baseball (1994-1997), and succeeded by the California Fall League (1999) and Hawaii Winter Baseball (2006-2008).\nMaryland Fall Baseball did not receive subsidies from Major League Baseball. Major League teams paid their own players, but did not cover front office staff, travel and equipment, leaving the Maryland league to rely almost exclusively on sponsorships and ticket sales, with a percentage of ticket revenue also allotted to Major League Baseball.\nAfter the season, having averaged about 900 fans a game, Maryland Fall Baseball was reported to have requested a subsidy of \"somewhere between $1,500 and $2,500 per player\" to continue the league, which Major League Baseball declined."

        "text": "The 2017 La Course by Le Tour de France with FDJ was the fourth edition of La Course by Le Tour de France, a women's cycle race held in France. The race was held before stage 18 of the 2017 Tour de France, between Briançon and the Col d'Izoard, on 20 July, and was followed by a pursuit race before stage 20 of the Tour de France. It was organised by the ASO. The first day counted also as the thirteenth race of the 2017 UCI Women's World Tour.\nBoth races had the same podium; Annemiek van Vleuten () won both races ahead of rider Lizzie Deignan, with the podium being completed each time by 's Elisa Longo Borghini.\nThe event was subsequently criticised, with issues regarding the 'pursuit' format, facilities for riders &amp; teams and the desire for a 'Women's Tour de France'.\nRoute and format.\nFollowing criticism by riders regarding the lack of progress towards a multi stage race, ASO announced in October 2016 that the race would remain a one-day event but move from the Champs-Élysées in Paris to a mountain stage on the Col d'Izoard.\nIt was then announced that the race would take place over two days. The top twenty finishers on the first day, or those within five minutes of the stage winner on the Col d'Izoard, were eligible to contest a second stage, over the same course as the men's time trial in Marseille on 22 July. However, for the purposes of the UCI Women's World Tour, only the results from the first day counted. The pursuit stage was held as a 1.15 categorised event, on the French Cycling Federation (FFC) calendar – and therefore did not count towards the UCI Women's World Tour – with riders starting at their respective time gaps from the Col d'Izoard.\nTeams.\n21 teams participated in the 2017 La Course by Le Tour de France. The top 15 UCI Women's World Tour teams were automatically invited, and obliged to attend the race.\nResults.\nLa Course by Le Tour de France - stage 1.\nOf the 119 riders to start the race, 47 completed the race within the time limit. 19 riders qualified for La Course Poursuite, as they finished within five minutes of race winner Annemiek van Vleuten.\nCriticism.\nFollowing the event, the race was criticised by the professional peloton and teams.\nAs only 20 riders qualified for the individual pursuit stage, teams were unable to plan logistics to get riders, equipment and team staff to Marseille. Lizzie Deignan subsequently noted that it took 9 hours to get off the mountain and to Marseille, with no police escort offered by organisers. The format of a 'pursuit' stage was thought not to be a success, as the mountain stage resulting in large time gaps that riders could not make up. Riders also criticised the facilities available in Marseille, with a lack of female toilets. The absence of TV coverage on the screens in the Stade Vélodrome where thee stage started and finished was also criticised.\nTeams and riders also criticised the move away from Paris, noting the attraction of the stage for sponsors. Campaigner Kathryn Bertine stated her disappointment that the race had not evolved into a multi day stage race, with former cyclist &amp; commentator Joanna Rowsell stating that \"We need mountain climbs, flat stages, time trials and a Champs-Elysees finish\".\nThe 2018 event reverted to a single day event, albeit remaining a mountain stage. In 2022, Tour de France Femmes held its first edition, to praise from the professional peloton, teams and media."

        "text": "The Penn Quakers Men's Ice Hockey team represents the University of Pennsylvania in the American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II. Penn is a member of the Colonial States College Hockey Conference. The Quakers play at the Class of 1923 Arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nHistory.\nPenn's first ice hockey team formed for the 1896–97 season. It began competing in the Intercollegiate Hockey Association (IHA), which included only 4 teams (the other three being Yale, Brown and Columbia), in 1898–99. On the first team in 1896–97 were several players of Canadian background, among them middle-distance runner George Orton. Early years were plagued by the lack of a local rink which forced the program to be suspended multiple times. In 1920 the Philadelphia Ice Palace opened, giving the team a more stable footing to operate, however, the lack of success on ice was evident. Despite growing popularity, the team was forced to fold in 1924 due to insufficient funding. In 1941, Penn re-entered the hockey world, competing in the Eastern Collegiate Hockey League and winning the league title that year. The Quakers continued to compete until the team was forced to dissolve as a result of World War II. Penn's hockey program was resurrected in the 1950s as a club team and became gradually more competitive until eventually reaching the varsity level in 1965.\nPenn played at the varsity level for the first time in the 1965–66 season, finishing 16–8. To support the team, in 1968, a group of donors and the Class of 1923 joined to fund the construction of the Class of 1923 Arena. In the 1970–71 season, the Quakers made the ECAC playoffs for the first time. The team would have similar success in the following season. The 1972–73 season was filled with similar success under a new coach, Bob Crocker, even beating defending national champion Boston University 7–3 in the first round of the ECAC tournament in Boston. Crocker had been an assistant coach at BU before coming to Penn.\nFollowing the success of the 1972–73 season, the team began a downward spiral. The university began to tighten the team's budget, which made recruiting more difficult and caused the level of play to decline. After the 1977–78 season, Penn's athletic department announced a plan to drop the hockey team's varsity status, along with that of the gymnastics, golf, and badminton teams, citing budgetary restraints. A 4-day sit-in resulted in an agreement between students and administration to preserve some of the cut programs, but not the varsity hockey team.\nSince falling from the varsity level, the Penn Quakers men's ice hockey team has maintained its status as a club team. During this period, the team has enjoyed numerous successes, including several championship appearances and victories. Today, the team competes in the ACHA Division II and continues to call the Class of 1923 Arena its home.\nOn July 9, 2019, a university-supported endowment for both the men's and women's ice hockey programs was announced. This was later further explained in the team's \"2025 Vision\" plan, which included a road map for the team to follow from ACHA Division II to NCAA Division I by the year 2025. At the time there was no plan to promote either program to the Division I level.\nSeason-by-season results.\nVarsity.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses (\"Games lost in either Overtime or Shootout\"), Pts = Points\"\nQuakers in the NHL.\nSource:"

        "title": "Rocky Gorge Rugby",
        "text": "The Rocky Gorge Rugby Football Club is a USA Rugby club men's Division I rugby union team based in Columbia, Maryland, United States. Gorge plays in the Mid-Atlantic Conference in the Capital Geographical Union. Rocky Gorge is the 2012 and 2014 USA Club Rugby Division II National Champions and has won four Mid-Atlantic Division I Championships.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe origins of Rocky Gorge began in 1986. After playing in college, Tom Owens tried to play with Baltimore but found it not worth the drive into the city. Owens discussed the idea of creating their own team with Dan Dawes and began to play with some local friends. Owens and Tom Bleichner attended the Cherry Blossom Tournament in 1986 and started to recruit for a new team. The original squad was about 18 members strong and adopted the team name of \"Rocky Gorge\" because they played near the Rocky Gorge Reservoir Dam in Laurel, MD.\nGorge's original jerseys were supposed to be black and silver. At the time, everyone wore long sleeve Maxmore jerseys, and the only two places to get them were Matt Godek and Leatherballs (now defunct). Leatherballs had a team set of forest green jerseys that they sold the team cheap, so Gorge started off wearing solid forest green jerseys.\nRocky Gorge officially was founded in 1986. To gain legitimacy and enter an organized union, Gorge petitioned to become an associate member of the Potomac Rugby Union (PRU). The initial attempt was denied, and the club was informed it would take two years to gain membership. Owens began scheduling matches with other clubs with the goal of improving its play. The PRU blackballed the team for not following its guidelines and waiting for membership. Owens and Bleichner cleared up the issues with the PRU and were accepted into the union in less than the two-year waiting period as a Division II club.\nGorge's first coach was Terry Kernan, a Frostburg graduate. Kernan eventually turned the reigns over to Chris Lee, another Frostburg alum. That impact turned into wins, and Gorge won the PRU in 1991. At Nationals, Gorge lost to the Fairfield Yankees. After the 1993 season, a number of players retired.\nMerger of Rocky Gorge and Columbia RFC.\nDiscussions of the merger with another club began in 1994. Columbia RFC, founded in 1986 by Rob Innella, was a DIII club in the PRU. Following a Slug 7s tournament, Gorge leadership saw that the core of players was older and recruitment was slow. Both clubs saw that they were competing over the same resources in the same area. Rocky Gorge had a good rapport with Columbia and Owens, and Columbia's Jim Hulbert talked about a merger at the Slug 7s. While talking outside the Triple 9s Bar and Billiards, the initial deal was struck between the two clubs. The merger took place to build a stronger team with a stronger foundation. The first combined Gorge-Columbia side played in Mason-Dixon's Halloween Tournament in the fall of 1994.\nThe points of the merger were that the new club would retain the name of \"Rocky Gorge,\" although an alternate name of Savage Rugby was entertained. In addition, Columbia's outstanding debts to the PRU were resolved as result of the merger. Columbia's annual 7s tournament started in 1990, the Slug 7s was adopted as part of the merger to go along with the annual Gorge Cup 15s college tournament. Slug meant \"Salisbury Losers, UMBC Goons\".\nPost-merger, the new squad played in DII and promptly won the PRU in 1995. For the next season, Gorge was placed in the DII-South Division of the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Football Union (MARFU) as part of the PRU.\nTransition from social club to competitive club.\nAside from two years from 2002 to 2004, where the team qualified for postseason play, Gorge suffered multiple losing seasons. For much of the 2000s, Gorge was known to be a social club with the motto \"win or lose, we still booze.\"\nChris Lee returned to coach the team from 1996 to 1998. In 1996, Gorge also held its first Gorge Cup 15s tournament. Meant to be a college 15s event that also showcased the Gorge 15s side in a league match. Four games were played in the inaugural tournament. Frostburg played Salisbury, the Frostburg Old Boys squared off against the Salisbury Old Boys, and motley crew of Gorge players clashed with UMBC. The tournament is still played to this day.\nAnother tradition was adopted by the club in 1996. On the way to Savannah, Ga., for the St. Patrick's Day tournament, Vince Michalski played \"Dancing Queen\" by ABBA non-stop for four hours until the CD was broken. He then had another copy on a continuous loop and played it until they arrived at their destination. From that moment on, \"Dancing Queen\" was the team song.\nFormer USA Eagle Clarence Culpepper took over coaching duties in 1999. Deploying a forward-oriented, smash-mouth, always recycling style of \"machine rugby\", Culpepper turned a losing record club into a playoff bound squad in 2003. Players from local colleges such as Frostburg, Salisbury, St. Mary's, and UMBC joined the team during that time and in the 2002–2003 season, Gorge had a 4–4 record advancing to the MARFU Quarterfinals against Raleigh, but lost 34–8.\nBuilding on the success from the season before, Gorge took its first international tour to England. The team played New Milton in Bournemouth resulting in a loss, Avon in Bath which was another loss, and finally beat Cheltenham in Cheltenham to close out the trip. Once back in the States, Gorge had its best season since 1995 under new coach Bo Newsome. It placed third in the regular season with a 5–2–1 record and edged the Washington Irish in the MARFU Quarterfinals, 31–22. In the semifinals, Gorge got blown out by Norfolk, 42–5.\nIn 2004–2005, following a mass retirement by many players, Culpepper returned as head coach, but the results didn't show on the field. Culpepper stayed on for the next season.\nIn June 2005, Gorge threw its first themed picnic at Justin Tagg's farm. The 2005 edition was Pirates featuring a ship ready to sail. The picnics continued for the next four years that included 2006's Post Apocalyptic Road Warrior bash with Bartertown, 2007's Wrestling Extravaganza with entry music and a fully functioning squared circle, 2008's Cowboys and Indians Pow-Wow, and 2010's Rednecks and Hillbillies Drink-Up with a pig-wrassling competition.\nFind a Way.\nBig changes started in 2006 when Chuck Moore became the sixth head coach of Rocky Gorge. Sensing that the team needed a new look to differentiate itself other local squads, the club colors were changed from green to royal blue, black, white. Gorge still struggled on the field in the 2006–2007 season.\nFour recently graduated players from Salisbury, Matty Shover, Sean Kelley, Ashton Thomas, and Tyler Wickline, were welcomed to Gorge. After having a perceived bad reputation in the PRU from college, many Salisbury graduates were not welcomed into men's club with open arms.\nThe 2007–2008 season was marked by highs and lows. Gorge went on its second international tour to Ireland playing Saint Mary's in Limerick, practicing in horrible conditions in Cork, and finishing up against Malahide in Dublin. The product during the regular season wasn't much better as club leadership had serious discussions of dropping down to DIII or even dissolving. Numbers were a major problem as the club barely had enough players for a starting side and struggled for the B side game.\nIn response, the recruitment machine began to build. Pete \"3-Pete\" Ressler, who had been on Gorge since 2003, brought in Kevin Nork who played at St. Mary's. The Salisbury train kept rolling with Erik Woodworth and former Rocky Gorge U-19 player Matt Burns. Gorge also tapped the UMBC pipeline to get Kevin Grooman and Ray Ahmed.\nIn 2009, Gorge took its third International tour to Argentina. During the ten day, 25-man tour, the club played Central Naval in Buenos Aires and Bigua in Mar de Plata. Following tour, Gorge had a team meeting with head coach Chuck Moore and president Trace Hall to concentrate on getting better as a club. Goals and plans were set in motion with a national championship in mind. The players and coaches wanted to change culture of the club from a social side to a serious, competitive side to attract quality players.\nThe 2010–2011 featured a massive recruitment class, especially from the collegiate National Championship squad from Salisbury. The likes of Andrew Kendall, Derek Chell, Matt Carroll, Dustin Meehan, Rob Pashkevich, Michael Cheese, Kris Townsel, Josh Cherriman, Matt Crowder, CJ Dyson, and Jonathan Biermann came from Salisbury.\nAfter noticing that the team didn't have warmup shirts and were getting ready for games in different colors, Justin Tagg bought blue shirts with \"Find a Way\" on them after a motto from Frostburg football. \"Find a Way\" became a mantra for the club.\nWith new players added to the roster, Gorge went from last to undefeated 5–0 in conference play. In the MARFU Playoffs, it beat Wilmington (29–10) in the quarterfinals, outscored Jersey Shore (54–23) in semifinals, and lost to Doylestown (31–24) in finals.\nAlthough Gorge lost in the MARFU Championship, it still qualified for the National Quarterfinals in Manassas, Va. Matching up against the Chicago Blaze, Gorge led at halftime up 6–5 off two penalty kicks. In the second half, Chicago kicked a PK to gain the 8–6 advantage. With about 10 minutes left, the Blaze tried to clear the ball deep in its zone with a box kick, but was charged down by Josh Cherriman. Pete Ressler scooped up the ball and scored, but the try was called back after an offsides call. Chicago took advantage of its opportunity scoring off a long run by its outside center to lead 15–6. With about two minutes remaining, Gorge moved the ball wide and Jon Biermann hit Ressler back on the inside for the converted try. Time ran out on Gorge's hopes of advancing to the National Semifinals as it lost 15–13.\nAfter the match, the club gathered again to address concerns and what needed to improve upon to win a national championship. Chuck Moore and the team president, Trace Hall, organized better funding to attract players (matching warmup shirts, team jackets). Ashton Thomas and Mark Cyphers were brought on as assistant coaches.\n2012 National Championship.\nWith recruitment of more newly graduated collegiate players in the summer of 2011, many of the new recruits still weren't sold on Gorge as a contender. Ashton Thomas organized a Salisbury only meeting and laid down an ultimatum, \"You guys are with us or against us,\" Ashton Thomas said. \"We're not going to wait around any more. We are going to move on with or without you. You have adopt the Rocky Gorge way, this is the way we are going to do it, and we are moving forward this way. Josh Brown always looked at that as the turning point of Rocky Gorge as a whole. After that we took off, the people who bought in stayed, whoever didn't left. We took off and the rest of the season did the way it did in 2012.\"\nThe player haul of 2012 included Josh Brown, Bryan Perez, Will Miller, Josh Stallings, and Mark Cyphers, Gorge rode an undefeated 5–0 record in Division II-South of the MARFU to the conference playoffs. In the quarterfinals, Gorge beat Brandywine, 58–24, and then bested Severn River, 39–22, in the semifinals. In the conference championship, Gorge finished off Wilmington, 29–24, to move on to Nationals.\nAt the National Regional Playoffs at Founders Field in Pittsburgh, Pa., Gorge dispatched the Eastside Banshees (Midwest #2), 48–12, in the Round of 16 On Sunday, Gorge played a tough Montauk Sharks club in the quarterfinals. Trailing 17–5 at the half, Gorge scored 22 unanswered points in the second half to win 27–17.\nAfter raising over $25,000 to send the team to Infinity Park in Glendale, Colorado for the championship weekend, Gorge faced Pacific Champion, Santa Rosa Rugby Club, on Saturday in the National Semifinals. In a match that lasted almost four hours because of weather delays, Gorge emerged as the 25–17 victor.\nOn Sunday in the stadium at Infinity Park, Gorge met the Wisconsin Rugby Club to decide the DII National Championship. After trailing for most of the first half, Rocky George fought back and closed the gap to 17–12 at halftime behind a pick and go try from Bryan Perez and an Andrew Kendall score set up by the strong running of Jon Biermann.\nWith the momentum coming out of the half, Dustin Meehan grabbed the lead for Gorge with a try in the 44th minute and a subsequent conversion by Kendall. Wisconsin answered with a penalty to retake the lead at 20–19, but Gorge came right back with another forwards try by Will \"A Strong Specimen of a Man\" Miller in the 50th minute.\nAnother Wisconsin penalty narrowed the score to 24–23, however, Gorge continued to pound with their forwards and backs. A Josh Brown try in the 65th minute extended the lead to 31–23. Kendall tacked on two more penalties in the final 15 minutes to close out the match and bring the trophy home to Maryland. Gorge triumphed 37–26 to win its first National title and Kendall was named MVP for his efforts.\n2014 National Championship.\nAfter a disappointing end to the 2012–2013 season in the National Quarterfinals, Gorge refocused its efforts for another championship run in 2014. With the core of its 2012 squad intact, key additions in place, and under the leadership of new coach and former U.S. Eagle Will Brewington, Gorge raced to an 8–0 record in Mid-Atlantic DII South piling up 413 points and only 71 points against. In addition to its DII club, 2013–2014 was the first season of its DIII side where Gorge went 6–8 in its inaugural season.\nIn the conference playoffs, Gorge destroyed the Lancaster Roses, 76–7, and followed it up with a 46–29 second half thrashing of Doylestown Rugby Club in the semifinals. On Sunday in the conference final, Gorge clawed back from a 14-point deficit at halftime to exact revenge on its rival Wilmington to win, 34–24. Wilmington held a 24–10 lead at the intermission after capitalizing a Gorge's mistakes. Gorge refocused at halftime paying attention to ball retention and finishing what it started. Behind tries from Nick Sylor, Nick DiMichele, Matt Carroll, and a clutch intercept by Ben Snyder, Gorge scored 24 unanswered points to achieve victory and move onto Nationals.\nAdvancing to Nationals for the fourth straight year, Gorge's quarterfinal matchup was a rematch of the 2012 championship against Wisconsin. In a defensive battle under horrible field and weather conditions, Gorge and Wisconsin traded blows in a closely contested affair. Nick DiMichele and Dustin Meehan scored for Gorge and Pete Ressler chipped in both conversions for a 14-point lead. Four minutes away from the shutout, Wisconsin made able to score a try off a charged down kick to cut the lead to 14–7. The Gorge defense clamped down and finished the game with a victory.\nIn the National Semifinal against New Haven Old Black RFC on Sunday, Gorge barely survived in an intense match full of momentum swings and tense moments. Gorge played great rugby for 60 minutes of the match building a 34–14 lead. The Old Black stormed back in the final 20 minutes as their backs burned up the defense. New Haven cut the advantage to one point at 34–33 with no time remaining and only the final conversion to be attempted. Fortunately for Gorge, the kick from the sideline sailed wide booking its ticket to the National Championship in Madison, Wisconsin.\nReturning the main event for the second time in three years, Gorge faced a formidable foe in the West's Tempe Old Devils. The Arizona club was an undefeated outfit from the Pacific South known for its potent and lethal offense. The DII National Championship at Breese Stevens Field in Madison, Wisconsin featured a clash in styles that culminated in an exciting 80 minutes of rugby.\nAs the game progressed, Rocky Gorge's stout defense and fundamental, ball-control offense stifled its opponent's attack as Tempe struggled to deploy its offense. Gorge shut out Tempe in the first half as Pete Ressler converted on a penalty, Josh Brown scored off a designed lineout play, and Jay Benedetti took an intercept try 40 meters for the 15–0 lead at the half.\nTempe looked to have righted the ship scoring in the 45th minute to cut the advantage to ten points, but Gorge's gritty and consistent defense continued to keep the Old Devils at bay. Two tries by scrumhalf Nick Sylor extended the lead to 27–5 and the defense closed out the match. Captain and eightman Josh Brown earned the MVP for his leadership and strong running from the back of the scrum.\nThe members of the 2014 National Championship team are:\nOne Last DII season.\nAfter winning the DII Mid-Atlantic, Gorge was offered a promotion to Division I for the 2014–2015 season. The club leadership declined and focused on its upcoming DII schedule. Gorge once again ripped through its opponents mounting an 8–0 regular season record. In addition to its divisional adversaries, Gorge also beat DI's Raleigh and the Potomac Exiles and tied the ARP's Boston RFC. The higher quality competition prepared Gorge for the conference playoffs as it ran past Media, Philadelphia-Whitemarsh, and Wilmington on its way to its third Mid-Atlantic Championship in four years. The DIII side improved from its first year finishing the season at 4–4.\nIn the National Quarterfinals in Charlotte, NC, Gorge was matched up against the South Champion, the Atlanta Old White. AOW jumped out to a 14–0 lead, but Gorge answered back with two Josh Brown tries to tie it up. Unfortunately for Gorge, scrumhalf Nick Sylor was injured shortly after and Coach Brewington had to go to his bench early. The Old White surged ahead once more to lead 21–14 at the half.\nGorge tightened up its game plan and dominated the first 20 minutes of the second half. With tries from Josh Cherriman, Matt Carroll, and Will Miller, Gorge regained the lead at 29–21. Atlanta rallied in the final 15 minutes to score the final two tries of the match and Gorge lost, 35–29.\nPromotion to DI.\nAt the end of the season, Gorge was promoted to Division I. Nick DiMichele took over the head coaching duties and significant additions such as US Eagle Ben Cima, Matias Cima, Brady Smith, Trevor Tanifum, Mike Tillman, Scotty Wheeler, and John Capobianco were welcomed to the club. Before the 2015–2016 regular season began, Gorge tested its might fulfilling its home and away match against Boston. In the early season primer, Gorge beat the Massachusetts squad, 22–17, on the road. Ready for its first DI romp and sporting new black and blue jerseys, Gorge enjoyed immediate success in DI shutting out three of its first four opponents. The wins continued to rack up and completed an undefeated 14–0 record, which included a 36–33 victory over the visiting ARP side, New York Athletic Club RFC.\nIn the DI Mid-Atlantic Playoffs, Gorge smacked Baltimore-Chesapeake in the semifinals, 66–7, to advance to the final against the Norfolk Blues. Using its superior speed and skill of its backline, Gorge outplayed the Blues en route to a 48–22 victory in its first year in DI. Trevor Tanifum, Scotty Wheeler, Nick Sylor, Brady Smith, Nick Kuhl, and Matias Cima (2) each scored in the match. Flyhalf Ben Cima led all scorers with 13 points with five conversions and a drop goal. With the win, Gorge advanced to the National Quarterfinals against Old Blue of New York.\nFor the DIII side, 2015–2016 was a breakout season. RGIII finished the regular season with an 8–1–1 record. In conference playoffs, Gorge dispatched Virginia Beach and the Washington Renegades to the way to the finals. Against Reading in the DIII MAC Championship, William Lomax, Aki Raymond (2), Matthew Phillips, and Bill Bush scored tries and Chris Bleiler had two conversions and a penalty for the 32–24 win. After the match, the determination of which team advanced to Nationals was disputed due to an eligibility issue. In the end, the USA Rugby Grievance Committee ruled in favor of Rocky Gorge allowing it to represent the Mid-Atlantic at Nationals.\nThe DIII Mid-Atlantic Champions were:\nAt Founders Field in Pittsburgh, the DIII side played and was clearly outmatched by the eventual DIII National Champion, the Fairfield Yankees. The opposition dominated from the opening whistle and ended the DIII season by the score of 39–12.\nPlaying on the beaten muddy field later in the day, Gorge DI played Old Blue with a ticket to the National Semifinals at stake. In a tough, hard fought test, Gorge matched Old Blue stride for stride and only trailed by three points with seven minutes remaining. Gorge was unable to complete the comeback in the final moments of the game as Old Blue won, 27–19. In the losing effort, Will Miller scored his team's lone try and Ben Cima kicked four penalties and a conversion.\n2016–2017 season.\nIn 2016–2017, Rocky Gorge repeated as the DI Mid-Atlantic Champions for the second year in a row towering over Norfolk, 52–31.

In its first year of elevated competition, RGII finished fourth in the DII-South with a 4–6 record.\n2017–2018 season.\nComing off its second Mid-Atlantic Conference DI title, Gorge went into the 2017–2018 season in search of its third conference championship. Unfortunately, Gorge was stopped short by rival, the Norfolk Blues. Gorge beat Norfolk in week seven and went into the regular season finale against the Blues undefeated. On the road, Gorge led at the half but Norfolk scored four tries in the second half to win 39–35. Gorge easily beat Pittsburgh in the MAC Semifinals setting up a rematch with Norfolk in the final. In the rain, Gorge led late 21–15, but the Blues scored twice in the final ten minutes to win 29–21.\nGorge's second side played in Division I-B against other DI clubs' B-sides and other DII clubs. The team went 7–2 in the regular season, but fell to Philadelphia-Whitemarsh, 57–14, in the MAC quarterfinals. \n2018–2019 season.\nFollowing the 2017–2018 season, Rocky Gorge made a change at the top installing Andrew \"Copperpot\" Chesterfield as club president and named a board to the team. Additionally, during the club banquet in November, Chuck Moore and Tom Henry donned the blue jackets as new members of the Rocky Gorge Hall of Fame.\nGorge was placed in the DI North division along with Schuylkill River, Pittsburgh, and Baltimore-Chesapeake. They will play each divisional opponent twice and play each team from the South division once.\nGorge DI swept through the Mid-Atlantic competition to an undefeated 10–0 record. In the conference playoffs, the team dispatched Potomac and NOVA to book its trip back to Nationals. Awaiting them in Raleigh were the Life Running Eagles. Life outmatched Gorge on the way to a 69–26 defeat.\nGorge's second side dropped down to DIII. During the regular season, the squad won every game they played in. RGD3 had to forfeit two of their games. Even with the forfeits, the team made it to the Central division final versus the Washington Irish. It took 100 minutes of rugby to complete but RGD3 won 38–35. Two weeks later in the Capital Championship, Gorge beat the Virginia Beach Falcons, 25–12, to earn its spot in the MAC Final. The Northeast Philadelphia Irish swarmed Gorge's back three and Gorge was unable to use its speed on the counterattack. The RGD3 2018–2019 season ended by a score of 41–7.\n2019–2020 season.\nAfter dropping its first game on the road against Schuylkill River, DI finished the fall with six straight victories to lead the north division.

RGD3 fell against division leaders, the Washington Irish and Severn River, to complete 2019 in third place at 5–2.\nAs the year flipped to 2020, the spring and entire season ended abruptly. USA Rugby shut down club rugby due to the COVID-19 virus and all games and team activities were cancelled.\n2021–2022 season.\nFollowing the sudden end of the 2019–2020 season, rugby began in the spring of 2021. Spring held only friendly matches between clubs in order to rebuild and return to play. Gorge began to rally in the fall of 2021, bringing both new and old faces to hopefully reach the playoffs once more.\n2022–2023 season.\nRocky Gorge finished in first place in DI with a 7–0–1 record and D3 came in second at 6–4.

        "text": "Les McDonald, (30 April 1933 – 4 September 2017) was the founding President of the International Triathlon Union (ITU) from 1989-2008, and was made an Honorary President for the organization until his death in 2017. He is largely credited with getting the sport of triathlon into the Olympic Games, with the inaugural race taking place at the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia, in 2000. He is a member of the Triathlon Canada Hall of Fame (2001), Canadian Olympic Hall of Fame (2007), the BC Sports Hall of Fame (2009), and the ITU Hall of Fame (2014). He was awarded the Olympic Order in 2010, in Vancouver, by the International Olympic Committee. He was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2013 by His Excellency the Right Honourable David Johnston, the Governor General of Canada.\nPersonal life.\nLes McDonald was born to a coal miner and a newspaper shopkeeper and grew up in Felling, a borough near Newcastle upon Tyne (where he was born), in the northeast of England, in 1933. He was the eldest of 3 children. He left school at the age of 14 to work in the coal mines and help support his family. He completed two years of military service and was part of the British army of occupation of Germany in the post-war period, which would eventually lead to him meeting his wife, Monique. In 1955, he immigrated to Vancouver, BC, where he married and had 3 children. As a young man in the northeast of England, he had discovered rock climbing and skiing. He became a legendary rock climber and would go on to achieve many first ascents in Canada, some with the legendary Fred Beckey. He then continued his passion for skiing, coaching at Grouse Mountain and Whistler Mountain. He helped form the Alta Lake Sports Club based out of Whistler, BC, Canada, and competed in several cross country ski marathons including the Engadin Skimarathon. During his early professional life, he worked as an electrician and labor union organizer with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. His prowess in sports administration and organization were heavily influenced by his experiences as a labour unionist.\nTriathlon.\nLes discovered Triathlon in the 1980s while cross-training for marathons. In 1981, he organized one of the first triathlons in Canada, which took place in Vancouver. He founded the British Columbia Triathlon Federation in 1983, followed by Triathlon Canada in 1984. He was President of Triathlon Canada from 1984-1996, and a member of the Canadian Olympic Committee Board of Directors. He was a five-time Ironman Age Group World Champion in the 50-55 age class from 1983 to 1987, setting consecutive age group record times in the process. He spent much of his own time and money traveling around the world setting up national triathlon governing bodies ahead of the 1989 World Championship and the inaugural International Triathlon Union (ITU) Congress in Avignon, France where he was elected President of the ITU. He is largely credited with getting the sport of triathlon into the Olympic Games through years of tireless effort and dedication to the sport. He was a driving force in the sport of triathlon, and pushed feminist values including equal prize money, representation, and concurrent medal ceremonies for male and female athletes. He remained president of the ITU until 2008, retiring at the age of 75. He was appointed as Honorary President of the ITU and remained in that position until his death."

        "title": "James Mitchell (basketball)",
        "text": "James Mitchell (born 15 January 1991) is an Australian professional basketball player for the Cairns Marlins of the NBL1 North. Between 2010 and 2016, he was based in his hometown of Cairns playing for the Marlins in the QBL and the Taipans in the NBL. Between 2017 and 2019, he played three seasons for the Rockhampton Rockets in the QBL and spent a season in England with the Sheffield Sharks. In 2021, he re-joined the Marlins.\nEarly life.\nMitchell was born in Kogarah, New South Wales and raised in the Cairns suburb of Redlynch.\nWhen Mitchell was 11 years old, having just finished Year 6 at Redlynch State School, his parents – John and Salli Mitchell – were killed in a head-on collision near Proserpine, four days short of Christmas on 21 December 2002. Salli was a tuckshop convenor at Redlynch State School and the coach of four junior basketball teams at Redlynch Basketball Club. John was a truck driver with Boral in Cairns. They were driving south to Sydney to join James and his then 14-year-old sister Kate – who had flown down to join their grandparents for Christmas – when they lost their lives in a horrific collision, which also killed three people in the other car. A park was dedicated to the memory of Mitchell's parents in Redlynch, the Salli and John Mitchell Memorial Park. Despite an offer to move in with their grandparents in Sydney, James and Kate remained in Cairns and were cared for by older sister Sam.\nBasketball career.\nCairns Marlins and Taipans (2010–2013).\nAfter winning a place in the Taipans Academy in 2009, Mitchell played for the Cairns Marlins of the Queensland Basketball League in 2010 and won a development player contract with the Cairns Taipans for the 2010/11 NBL season. By December 2010, he was studying physical education at James Cook University in tandem with his Taipans duties, having made his NBL debut on 13 November 2010 against the Gold Coast Blaze. Mitchell spent three seasons with the Taipans as a development player, playing in five games in 2010/11, four games in 2011/12, and one game in 2012/13. He also continued to play for the Marlins in 2011, 2012 and 2013.\nPost-Taipans stint (2015–2016).\nAfter a knee injury ruled him out of the entire 2014 QBL season, an injury which sidelined him for about 18 months, Mitchell returned to the Cairns Marlins in 2015 and was appointed team captain. In 2016, he captained the Marlins to their first QBL Championship since 2009.\nMitchell was often regarded as the heart of the Marlins program; with Taipans development players coming and going over the years, Mitchell was always a consistent presence. However, when negotiating with the Marlins in March 2017 ahead of the 2017 season, Mitchell sought remuneration, having gone unpaid with the Marlins for his entire career. Following a breakdown between Mitchell and Cairns Basketball boss Mike Scott, Mitchell parted ways with the Marlins.\nRockhampton Rockets (2017–2019).\nOn 27 March 2017, Mitchell signed with the Rockhampton Rockets for the 2017 QBL season. Mitchell, who was in the final stages of finishing his teaching degree at the time of signing with the Rockets, flew in and out to Rockhampton in the first part of the season before moving south. After a slow start to the 2017 season, the Rockets charged into the finals with an end-of-season run that saw them eliminate the top seed Brisbane Capitals in the quarter-finals before eventually succumbing to the Mackay Meteors in the semi-finals.\nOn 17 November 2017, Mitchell re-signed with the Rockets for the 2018 season. He was named player of the week for round one. He appeared in all 19 games for the Rockets in 2018, averaging 14.5 points, 7.0 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 2.4 steals per game.\nIn November 2018, Mitchell re-signed with the Rockets for the 2019 season.

The Horned Frogs played their home games at Charlie &amp; Marie Lupton Baseball Stadium as a member of the Big 12 Conference. They were led by head coach Jim Schlossnagle, the winningest coach in TCU baseball history, in his 15th year at TCU.\nPrevious season.\nThe Horned Frogs entered the 2018 season on the heels of four consecutive trips to the College World Series. The 2017 TCU Horned Frogs baseball team entered the season as the unanimous preseason #1 team, and the favorite to win the Big 12 regular season championship. They notched a 39–14 (16–8) regular season record, and won a Big 12 Conference championship for the fourth-straight season, sharing the regular season co-championship with Texas Tech. In the postseason, the Horned Frogs advanced to the Big 12 tournament semifinals, before being eliminated by Texas. TCU was selected as the #6 National Seed the NCAA tournament, the Horned Frogs' highest-ever national seed. Star-first baseman/designated hitter Luken Baker was unavailable for the Tournament after a late-regular season injury. The Frogs coasted to a 3–0 record in the Fort Worth Regional, with wins over Central Connecticut, #11 Virginia, and #20 Dallas Baptist, and a 2–0 sweep of #8 Missouri State in the Fort Worth Super Regional to advance to the College World Series for the fourth-straight year. In Omaha, the Frogs fell in their opener to eventual-national champion, Florida, an 0–3 loss at the hands of Gator starting pitcher Alex Faedo. TCU then eliminated #8 Texas A&amp;M and #4 Louisville to advance to a rematch with Florida in the national semifinals. The Frogs' win over the Aggies marked the third consecutive season, and the fourth in the past six seasons, that TCU eliminated Texas A&amp;M from the NCAA tournament. The Frogs then beat #3 Florida 9–2 in the teams' first rematch before falling to the Gators in a decisive national semifinal game, again an 0–3 loss to Alex Faedo. The loss marked the third-straight year that TCU's season ended in the national semifinals. TCU finished the season ranked #4 in every final poll, with a 50–18 record (the Frogs' third 50-win season).\nPreseason.\nMLB draft.\nThe following Horned Frogs on the 2016 roster were selected in the 2017 Major League Baseball draft:\n\"* indicates draftee had no more college eligibility\"\nDeparted Players.\nThe following Horned Frogs on the 2017 roster departed the program prior to the 2018 season:\nRecruiting Class.\nThe Horned Frogs added the following players to the roster as part of their 2017 recruiting class:\nSeason Projections.\nComing off four-straight College World Series appearances in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, returning anticipated starting pitchers Jared Janczak, Rex Hill and Nick Lodolo, and adding a highly ranked recruiting class, the 2018 Horned Frogs were projected as one of the \"Eight for Omaha\" in July 2017 by Baseball America, D1 Baseball, and Perfect Game.\nThe Horned Frogs were ranked in each major preseason poll and ranking. TCU was ranked #3 by Perfect Game, #4 in the USA Today Coaches Poll, #5 in the NCBWA Poll, #7 by D1 Baseball and Baseball America, and #9 by Collegiate Baseball.\nBig 12 coaches predicted TCU would finish second in league play, with 4 of the 9 coaches picking TCU to finish in first place.\nPersonnel.\nCoaching staff.\nTCU will return its entire coaching staff from the Frogs' 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 College World Series seasons. Pitching coach Kirk Saarloos, a California native, was reportedly courted by Stanford to replace 31-season head coach Mark Marquess, but Saarloos opted to remain at TCU.\nRoster.\nThe Horned Frogs' 2018 roster consists of 17 returners and 15 new players. Nearly half of the roster (15 of 32 players) are from outside the State of Texas. Sophomore catcher Zach Humphreys and freshman pitcher Russell Smith were high school teammates at Midlothian High School, and sophomore pitcher Cal Coughlin and freshman outfielder Brad Czerniejewski were high school teammates at Lake Forest High School in Illinois. Junior catcher Colton Parrish and junior outfielder Johnny Rizer were teammates at Blinn College before transferring to TCU prior to the 2018 season. \nSchedule and results.\n! style=\"background:#4d1979;color:white;\"| Regular season\n! style=\"background:#4d1979;color:white;\"| Postseason"

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "A number of notable controversies and concerns associated with the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, emerged which were the subject of public debate and media commentary.\nRussian doping.\nOfficial sanctions.\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that the Russian Olympic Committee had been suspended effective immediately from the 2018 Winter Olympics. Athletes who had no previous drug violations and a consistent history of drug testing were to be allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag as an \"Olympic Athlete from Russia\" (OAR). Under the terms of the decree, Russian government officials were barred from the Games, and neither the country's flag nor anthem would be present. The Olympic Flag and Olympic Anthem will be used instead, and on 20 December 2017 the IOC proposed an alternate logo for the uniforms (seen at right). IOC President Thomas Bach said that \"after following due process [the IOC] has issued proportional sanctions for this systematic manipulation while protecting the clean athletes.\"\nAs of January 2018, the IOC had sanctioned 43 Russian athletes from the 2014 Winter Olympics and banned them from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission. All but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes meaning that their Sochi medals and results are reinstated but decided that there was sufficient evidence against 11 athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. The IOC said in a statement that \"the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation\" and that \"this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping\". The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent\" and that they would consider an appeal against the court's decision. The court also decided that none of the 39 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games. Three Russian athletes are still waiting for their hearing, which will be conducted after the 2018 Games. After the CAS decision was announced, the four-time Olympic champion in biathlon Alexander Tikhonov demanded to call to account the President of the IOC for \"false accusations\". Russia's sports minister Pavel Kolobkov wanted the IOC to ensure the participation of these Russian athletes at the Olympics in Pyeongchang.\nAn original pool of 500 Russian athletes was put forward for consideration for the games and 111 were immediately removed from consideration. The remaining athletes had to meet pre-games conditions such as further pre-games tests and reanalysis from stored samples. Only if these requirements are met, can the athletes be considered for invitation to the games. None of the athletes who had been sanctioned by the Oswald Commission were still in the pool.\nThe final number of neutral Russian athletes invited to compete was 169.\nOn 22 February Alexander Krushelnitskiy of the Olympic Athletes from Russia team was stripped of his bronze medal in mixed doubles curling after testing positive for meldonium.\nReaction in Russia.\nIn the past, Vladimir Putin, the President of Russia, and other officials had said that it would be a humiliation for Russia if its athletes were not allowed to compete under the Russian flag. However, his spokesman later said that no boycott had been discussed. After the IOC decision was announced, Ramzan Kadyrov, the head of Chechnya, announced that no Chechen athletes would participate under a neutral flag. On 6 December, Putin stated that the Russian government would not prevent any athletes from participating at the Games as individuals, but there were calls from other politicians for a boycott. Gennady Zyuganov, a leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, proposed to send fans with a Soviet Victory Banner. Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergey Lavrov has said that the United States \"fears honest competition\", affirming Vladimir Putin's position who had said that the United States used its influence within the International Olympic Committee to \"orchestrate the doping scandal\". According to \"Komsomolskaya Pravda\", a popular Russian newspaper, 86% of the Russian population oppose participating in the Olympics under a neutral flag, and many Russian fans attended the Games wearing the Russian colours and chanting \"Russia!\" in unison, in an act of defiance against the ban.\nInternational reactions.\nThe IOC's decision was criticized by Jack Robertson, primary investigator of the Russian doping program on behalf of the World Anti-Doping Agency, who said that the IOC has issued \"a non-punitive punishment meant to save face while protecting the [IOC’s] and Russia’s commercial and political interests\". He also emphasized that Russian whistleblowers provided empirical evidence that \"99 percent of [their] national-level teammates were doping.\" According to Robertson, \"[WADA] has discovered that when a Russian athlete [reaches] the national level, he or she [has] no choice in the matter: [it is] either dope, or you’re done\". \"There is currently no intelligence I have seen or heard about that indicates the state-sponsored doping program has ceased\", he added.\nIt was also reported that Russian officials intensively lobbied US politicians in an apparent attempt to achieve Grigory Rodchenkov's (main whistleblower) extradition to Russia.\nJustin Peters of \"Slate\" magazine wrote that the IOC \"ended up with a situation that seemed to negate the entire point of the sanctions against Russia. The IOC did not want there to be a Russian Olympic team at the Pyeongchang Games. And yet the hockey, curling, and figure-skating arenas are full of teams of Russian Olympians ... [this is] a half-hearted wrist slap issued by an entity that appears more interested in saving face than in protecting athletes\".\nThe Court of Arbitration for Sport decision to overturn life bans of 28 Russian athletes and restore their medals met fierce criticism among Olympic officials, including IOC president Thomas Bach who had said this decision is \"extremely disappointing and surprising.\" Grigory Rodchenkov's lawyer has said that \"the CAS decision would allow doped athletes to escape without punishment\".\n\"[CAS decision] provides yet another ill-gotten gain for the corrupt Russian doping system generally, and Putin specifically\", – he added.\nSecurity.\nOn 20 September 2017, South Korea's President Moon Jae-in said the country is pushing to ensure security at Pyeongchang Winter Olympic Games amid rising tensions over nuclear tests and a series of missile launches conducted by North Korea during the summer. However, on the next day, French Minister of Youth Affairs and Sports Laura Flessel-Colovic said France's Winter Olympics team will boycott the games unless South Korea's security is guaranteed.\nOn 22 September 2017, Austria and Germany joined France in considering not attending the Games. Karl Stoss, head of Austria's national Olympic committee, said that, \"if the situation worsens and the security of our athletes is no longer guaranteed, we will not go to South Korea.\" Several days later, Laura Flessel-Colovic reaffirmed France's participation in the games. Austria and Germany did not boycott the Games.\nKim Yo-jong, the younger sister of dictator Kim Jong-un, attended the opening ceremony and shook hands with the South Korean President Moon Jae-in. This marked the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea.\nDuring the Games.\nScheduling and crowds.\nTo accommodate primetime broadcasts in the Americas, figure skating events were scheduled with morning start times; figure skating is one of the most popular Winter Olympic sports among U.S. viewers (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on 7 May 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 games, is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC). This scheduling practice affected the events themselves, including skaters having to adjust to the modified schedule, as well as the attendance levels of the sessions.\nConversely, and somewhat controversially, eight of the eleven biathlon events were scheduled at night, making it necessary for competitors to ski and shoot under floodlights, with colder temperatures and blustery winds.\nNBC analyst comment.\nDuring the opening ceremony, NBC analyst Joshua Cooper Ramo noted that Japan occupied Korea from 1910 to 1945, and then added, \"But every Korean will tell you that Japan is a cultural and technological and economic example that has been so important to their own transformation.\" \"The Korea Times\" called the comment \"incorrect and insensitive.\" While Norman Pearlstine, former Time Inc. Editor-in-Chief, stated his opinion that Ramo's comments contained elements of truth, but that he also engaged in needless hyperbole, American media outlets were overwhelmingly critical of Ramo's statements, denouncing them as \"clueless\", \"false\", and containing \"endless generalities\".\nIn response to this backlash, NBC issued an on-air apology and Ramo was fired from his job at NBC the next day.\nHigh winds.\nMany snow events were plagued by high winds, causing dangerous conditions. An opening ceremony took place in extreme cold with a wind chill temperature of −22 °C and some visitors left early because of the harsh cold.\nDutchman Niek van der Velden broke his arm due to a fall caused by the wind and in a training run for the men's slopestyle event. Due to the high winds, many events were delayed. Snowboarding, freestyle skiing, alpine skiing, ski jumping, and biathlon sessions were postponed or even cancelled. On 14 February, the fifth day of the Games, only one Alpine skiing event had been contested (Men's combined) out of the original four.\nAfter the qualification of the women's slopestyle was cancelled, there were still massive winds in the final session. Of the 25 participants, only five managed to stay on their feet during the first run. No snowboarders recorded two clear runs. Several snowboarders said that the final was \"irresponsible\", \"too dangerous\" and \"should never have been held\". According to the FIS, the conditions were \"within the norm\".\nOn 14 February there was such a strong wind on the Olympic Park, that spectators were sent inside to shelter for the wind and all activities of the Olympic park were postponed. Parts of tents became detached and temporary structures and Coca-Cola fridges were broken. The media tents had been closed as well due to high winds.\nOther.\nEcological issues at Jeongseon Alpine Centre.\nEnvironmental groups have raised concerns surrounding the deforestation from the slopes of Gariwang mountain to build the Jeongseon Alpine Centre. Officials claim it is necessary as it is the only slope that will accommodate Olympic requirements, but the Environmental groups disagreed and filed a complaint to the IOC. The South Korean government leased the mountain for the events on the condition that the forest will be restored after the games are done. Environmental groups are skeptical as the forest includes old growth of ancient and rare species.\nWorld map without Japan.\nThe official website of the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games posted a world map without the Japanese archipelago. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga Yoshihide requested an immediate correction of the map. The PyeongChang organizing committee corrected the map and said it was a \"simple mistake\".\nExclusion of Samsung smartphones to Iranian and North Korean athletes.\nBoth the International Olympic Committee and the PyeongChang Organizing Committee decided to exclude Iranian and North Korean athletes from their free giveaway of Samsung Galaxy Note 8 smartphones. The decision was due to the concern and delay over confirming whether giving away mobile devices to Iranian and North Korean athletes would violate the UN sanctions against Iran and North Korea. In response, the Iranian government summoned the South Korean envoy to complain about the situation.\nAs the IOC confirmed that distributing mobile devices would not violate the UN sanction of Iran, which is being uplifted after Iran's JCPOA in 2015, all participating athletes were given the Galaxy Note 8 regardless of their nationalities. However, due to the still active UN sanction, North Korean athletes were given the smart phones on the condition that they would return the devices to the organizing committee before going back to their home country.\nDog meat trade.\nThe Winter Olympics have again caused comments about the dog meat trade issue in Korea. Speed skater Jan Blokhuijsen made a comment during a press conference to the host South Koreans to \"treat dogs better in this country\", criticizing dog meat eating culture of South Korea. However Blokhuijsen apologized soon after he was criticized by public. In the run-up to the Olympics, South Korea closed its biggest dog meat market. More than 800,000 dogs were being kept in the market which accounts for about a third of the country's dog meat consumption.\nKim Jong-un impersonator.\nOn 14 February 2018, a man impersonating Kim Jong-un was ejected from the stands after walking through the North Korean cheerleading squad.\nViolence by IOC member.\nOn 15 February 2018, IOC member Adam Pengilly was not allowed to enter the parking lot, since the route was only for buses, not pedestrians. Denied by security, Pengilly blamed and shoved security. According to security, Pengilly said to the security \"If you report this incident to authority, you won't be able to work in Korea.\". After the investigation, Pengilly was sent home from the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics and apologised for his action, but denied a confrontation. IOC President Thomas Bach met with the security official on 17 February to apologize in person.\nCanada’s Kim Boutin receiving online death threats from South Korean fans.\nKim Boutin won the bronze medal in the 500-metre short-track speedskating event after South Korea's Choi Min-jeong was disqualified for interfering with Boutin. Shortly after, Boutin's social media accounts were inundated with hateful comments and death threats from angry South Korean fans. The International Olympic Committee issued a statement urging everyone to respect the athletes and their performances. \nSouth Korean skaters skip a lyric to avoid offending Japan.\nSouth Korean ice dancers Yura Min and Alexander Gamelin performed their routine containing Sohyang's rendition of Arirang Alone by Seo Yu-seok with an omitted line. A spokesman from the Korea Skating Union told the skaters to \"prepare a version without the lyrics to avoid political controversy\", a line in the lyrics containing a reference to the disputed islands of the Liancourt Rocks (known as \"Dokdo\" in Korean and \"Takeshima\" in Japanese) where both nations (as well as North Korea) claim sovereignty over them. The pair omitted the lyric without any problems."

        "title": "National Invitational Volleyball Championship",
        "text": "The National Invitational Volleyball Championship is an NCAA Division I women's college volleyball postseason tournament sponsored by the American Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA) and operated by Triple Crown Sports. Its original incarnation ran from 1989–95. After a 22-year hiatus, it was revived in 2017.\nHistory.\nThe NCAA began sponsoring women's college volleyball championships in 1981, replacing the AIAW as the highest-level governing body for the sport. The 1981 tournament consisted of 20 teams.\nIn the first few years, the NCAA field was composed largely of teams from the southwest and west coast, but the sport grew in nationwide popularity in the 1980s. By 1988, the NCAA tournament had expanded to 32 teams. However, there were 29 women's volleyball conferences in 1988 and only 16 were represented in the tournament.\nThe idea for the National Invitational Volleyball Championship was hatched that fall by a trio of volleyball coaches from schools belonging to unrepresented conferences: Brenda Williams from UAB, Charlie Daniel from Western Kentucky, and Geri Polvino from Eastern Kentucky. Williams and Polvino were frustrated that their teams had each won conference titles but could not play postseason volleyball because the NCAA didn't invite them, so they created a second-tier postseason volleyball tournament, the Women's Invitational Volleyball Championship, to debut in 1989.\nThe 1989 tournament was held in four regional pools of four teams each, with a playoff for the pool winners. Wisconsin won the trophy that year, and the idea was such a success that the next year's tournament was held at the University of Tennessee, an extra team was added to each pool, and attendance increased tenfold from 500 to 5000. In 1991, the tournament was renamed the National Invitational Volleyball Championship, and by 1992 it was so popular that it was moved to the Municipal Auditorium in Kansas City, a 7300-seat arena. The NIVC held its tournament there for the last four years of its initial existence.\nBy 1993, however, the NCAA Tournament had expanded to 48 teams, and the next year it introduced play-in games, which allowed nearly every conference champion a spot in the tournament. The NIVC felt it had done its job in kindling national interest in the sport, and its tournament folded after 1995, sitting dormant for the next 22 years.\nHowever, by 2016, many in the sport felt there could be a market for a second-tier volleyball tournament. Regular-season champions in smaller conferences are often not given any postseason if they don't win their conference tournament, despite outstanding regular seasons, such as the 2005 Albany (28–4), 2009 Southern Miss (27–5), or 2010 Ball State (24–5) teams. Also, there are many larger conferences with large fan bases that only send a few teams to the tournament each year—for example, the Atlantic Coast Conference regularly sends only three or four teams to the NCAA Tournament, disappointing the fans of the other teams. In December 2016, the tournament was revived as a 32-team tournament, scheduled for its second debut in November 2017. The new tournament is run by Triple Crown Sports, which has run basketball's WNIT for the past two decades and also started a National Invitational Softball Championship in spring 2017.\nThe 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which emerged in March 2020.\nSelection process.\nThe new NIVC consists of 32 teams that did not make the NCAA Tournament. This includes automatic qualifications for the best team from each of the 32 conferences to not be invited to the NCAA Tournament, with any vacancies filled by at-large bids to the teams with the highest RPI, regardless of conference or geographic location. The field is grouped into 4-team regionals based on geographic location. The full field was announced a few hours after the actual NCAA selection show on the night of Sunday, November 26, although some automatic bids were announced earlier.\nChampions.\n\"Reference:\""

The film \"Mighty Ducks\" released in the 1990s helped promote the winter sport in the country, with most members of the 2017 national team citing the film as their inspiration in taking up the sport.\nThe governing body of ice hockey in the country, the Federation of Ice Hockey League (FIHL), was formed years later in February 2015. The FIHL was admitted as an associate member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) on 20 May 2016 and secured Philippine Olympic Committee membership by July 2016.\nA IIHF sanctioned league, the Philippine Hockey League was organized in 2018 fulfilling a prerequisite for the Philippine men's national team participation in the Ice Hockey World Championships.\nNational and international competitions.\nPrior to 2008 and before the formation of the FIHL, club selection teams competed in regional competitions as unofficial national teams.\nAfter the formation of the FIHL, national ice hockey teams were officially organized. The men's national team made their official debut at the 2017 Asian Winter Games while the women's team made theirs at the 2017 IIHF Women's Challenge Cup of Asia.\nThe main league in the country is the Philippine Hockey League which follows IIHF regulations. A recreational ice hockey league, the Manila Ice Hockey League, is also held.\nParticipation rates.\nSince the Philippines is a tropical country with no winter season, ice hockey and some other winter sports are played on artificial ice rinks.

        "text": "Daniel Stephen Jones III (born May 27, 1997), nicknamed \"Danny Dimes\", is an American football quarterback for the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Duke and was selected sixth overall by the Giants in the 2019 NFL Draft.\nEarly years.\nJones attended Charlotte Latin School in Charlotte, North Carolina. During his high school career, he had 6,997 passing yards and 98 touchdowns. Despite these numbers, Jones was barely recruited coming out of high school and was not ranked by Rivals.com. \nJones originally committed to Princeton University to play college football, but then opted to become a walk-on at Duke University.\nCollege career.\n2016.\nAfter redshirting his first year at Duke in 2015, Jones became the starting quarterback in his sophomore season in 2016 after quarterback Thomas Sirk suffered a season-ending injury. Jones started all 12 games, completing 270 of 430 passes (62.8%) for 2,836 yards, sixteen touchdowns and nine interceptions.\n2017.\nIn 2017, he completed 230 of 413 passes (55.7%) for 2,439 yards, 14 touchdowns and 11 interceptions as a junior. Jones was named MVP of the 2017 Quick Lane Bowl against Northern Illinois where he went 27-of-40 with 252 passing yards and two touchdowns, along with 86 rushing yards from sixteen carries for one touchdown.\n2018.\nDuring his senior year, Jones was named the MVP in the 2018 Independence Bowl, where he went 30–41 with 423 passing yards and five touchdowns in a 56–27 victory over Temple. He later played in the 2019 Senior Bowl for the North team, and was also the MVP of that game, going 8-of-11 with 115 passing yards and one touchdown.\nProfessional career.\n2019.\nJones was drafted by the New York Giants in the first round with the sixth overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft. On July 22, 2019, Jones signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $25.664 million, including a $16.7 million signing bonus.\nDespite a stellar preseason, Jones was named the backup behind Eli Manning. Jones played his first regular season game on September 8, 2019, against the Dallas Cowboys in relief of Manning, where he completed 3-of-4 passes for 17 yards and lost a fumble as the Giants lost 35–17. On September 17, 2019, Jones was named the starter over Manning for the week 3 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In his first start, Jones completed 23 out of 36 passes for 336 yards with a 112.7 passer rating and two passing touchdowns along with 28 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 32–31 comeback win against the Buccaneers despite losing two fumbles. He became the first Giants' rookie quarterback to win his first career start since Scott Brunner in 1980. Jones led the Giants back from an 18-point deficit to beat the Buccaneers and became the seventh rookie quarterback in NFL history since 2010 to have a game-winning drive in their first career start.

He appeared in his first NFL career game against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He was waived on September 13 and later re-signed to the active roster on September 18. He was passed on the depth chart by rookie Chris Thompson and was released on September 27, 2017.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn September 30, 2017, Jones was signed to the Detroit Lions' practice squad.

He was activated off PUP on November 3, 2018, but was waived two days later and re-signed to the practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on November 17, 2018. He made his first career NFL reception on November 22 during the Thanksgiving day game against the Chicago Bears. He got his first touchdown reception on December 16 against the Bills. He appeared in 8 games with 3 starts, posting 11 receptions for 80 yards and one touchdown.\nOn August 31, 2019, Jones was waived/injured by the Lions and placed on injured reserve.

        "text": "The 2017–18 Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team represented the University of Nebraska in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Cornhuskers were led by sixth-year coach head coach Tim Miles and played their home games at Pinnacle Bank Arena in Lincoln, Nebraska as members of the Big Ten Conference. They finished the season 22–11, 13–5 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for fourth place. As the No. 4 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost in the quarterfinals to Michigan. Despite winning 13 Big Ten games, the Cornhuskers did not receive a bid to the NCAA tournament, but did receive a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. However, they lost in the first round of the NIT to Mississippi State.\nPrevious season.\nThe Cornhuskers finished the 2016–17 season 12–19, 6–12 in Big Ten play to finish in a tie for 12th place in conference. As the No. 12 seed in the Big Ten tournament, they lost in the first round to Penn State. This marked the fourth losing season in five years for coach Tim Miles. However, following the season, Nebraska athletic director Shawn Eichorst indicated that Tim Miles would return as head coach for Nebraska.\nSchedule and results.\nThe 2018 Big Ten tournament was held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Due to the Big East's use of that venue for their conference tournament, the Big Ten tournament took place one week earlier than usual, ending the week before Selection Sunday. This meant qualifying teams had nearly two weeks off before the NCAA tournament. As a result, the Big Ten regular season began in mid-December. Coaches requested that no Big Ten game be scheduled between Christmas and New Year's Day; accordingly, each team played two conference games in early December before finishing non-conference play.\nOn October 18, 2017, the school announced that it would play a charity exhibition game against Mississippi State on October 22 in Starkville, Mississippi to raise money for hurricane victims.\n!colspan=9 style=|Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=|Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NIT "

The derby was held on July 16, 2018, at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., the site of the 2018 MLB All-Star Game. On July 11, the participants were announced. Bryce Harper was the winner, as he beat Kyle Schwarber, in the final 19–18, winning the derby in front of his hometown crowd. He tied Schwarber on the last pitch as time expired in regulation; then won it with 16 seconds left in bonus time.\nRules.\nEight players participate in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player has four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters are awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters are also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute result in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile &amp; MLB, to Team Rubicon.\nThe eight competing players are seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. While the lower seed hits first, the higher seed hits second in all rounds. The round ends if the higher seed exceeds the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player gets three swings; whoever hits more home runs in the three swings will be declared the winner; thereafter, sudden death swings will occur until the tie is broken."

Wawrinka's withdrawal ended his streak of 50 consecutive major appearances, dating back to the 2005 French Open. Reigning finalist Novak Djokovic also withdrew due to an elbow injury that ended his season, ending his streak of 51 consecutive major appearances, dating back to the 2005 Australian Open. Accordingly, this was the first men's singles draw at the US Open since 1971 to include neither finalist from the previous year's tournament.\nAfter the loss of Marin Čilić in the third round, a first-time major finalist was guaranteed from the bottom half of the draw. Anderson was the first South African man to reach the final since Cliff Drysdale in 1965, and at any major singles final since Kevin Curren at the 1984 Australian Open, as well as the lowest-ranked man to reach the US Open singles final since the ATP rankings began in 1973.

Nadal retained the top ranking following Murray's withdrawal and Federer's loss in the quarterfinals.\nFederer broke the men's singles record for total appearances at majors with his 71st participation. He was attempting to go undefeated at the majors for the season (having won the Australian Open and Wimbledon Championships and not played the French Open), but lost to Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals. Andrey Rublev became the youngest man to reach the US Open quarterfinals since Andy Roddick in 2001, and Denis Shapovalov became the youngest man to reach the fourth round of the US Open since Michael Chang in 1989.

The same year, he was one of the participants on the Masters. However, he lost in the first round to Dirk van Duijvenbode.\nOn the 2024 PDC Pro Tour, Searle was runner-up in Players Championships 1 &amp; 2, losing to Luke Littler 8–7 and Gary Anderson 8–5 in the respective finals.

        "text": "Tarik Black (born February 10, 1998) is an American football wide receiver who is a free agent. He played college football at Michigan and Texas.\nEarly years.\nBlack attended Cheshire Academy in Cheshire, Connecticut. He was a four-star recruit ranked as the No. 81 high school player in the country by ESPN. He was also rated as the top recruit in Connecticut and was invited to play in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nBlack received scholarship offers from Auburn and Alabama, among others. In December 2016, in a Facebook live broadcast, he committed to play college football at the University of Michigan.\nCollege career.\nBlack enrolled early at Michigan in January 2017. He participated in Michigan's spring practice where he impressed observers.\nOn September 2, 2017, Black started at wide receiver as a true freshman in Michigan's season opener against Florida. He scored a touchdown on his first collegiate reception and had two receptions for 83 yards in the game. During the fourth quarter of the Wolverines' third game of the season against Air Force, Black was injured and left with a broken left foot. At the time of his injury, he led the team in receiving yards. He did not return for the rest of the season, finishing with 11 catches for 149 yards and one touchdown in three games.\nJust before the start of his sophomore season in 2018, Black suffered another, similar injury, this time fracturing his right foot. He saw his first playing time of the year on November 3 against Penn State, and recorded his first catch of the year two weeks later against Indiana.

His only start came in the first game of the season, against UTEP, after which he lost the starting job to Brennan Eagles. He did not play in his final game at Texas and opted not to play in the Alamo Bowl, even though Eagles also opted out meaning he would've gotten more playing time.\nProfessional career.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nBlack signed with the Indianapolis Colts as an undrafted free agent on May 6, 2021.

        "text": "Harold McKinley Cooper (February 14, 1923 – October 4, 2010) was an American politician and Minor League Baseball executive who served as president of the International League from 1978 to 1990. He is recognized as the father of modern baseball in Columbus, Ohio, for twice helping return the game to the park that would subsequently be named Cooper Stadium in his honor.\nEarly life and the Red Birds.\nCooper grew up in the Columbus neighborhood of Franklinton, just a few blocks from the site where the St. Louis Cardinals built a home for their American Association franchise in 1932. He visited Red Bird Stadium while it was still under construction, bringing lunch to grandfather who was serving as a foreman.\nLater, he would sneak into games frequently, occasionally getting caught. After one such apprehension, Red Birds president George Trautman gave him an unpaid job cleaning mold off hot dogs. In 1935, he was promoted to the paid job of clubhouse boy, cleaning uniforms, shining shoes and running errands for the players.\nMilitary service and return to baseball.\nCooper graduated from Central High School in 1940 and attended Ohio State University in 1941. He then served in the United States Coast Guard from 1942 to 1946. After the war, he took a position in Columbus with the National Association of Professional Baseball Leagues (later known as Minor League Baseball) before heading to Hutchinson, Kansas, where he would be named The Sporting News Minor League Executive of the Year in 1950 while running the Western Association affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates.\nColumbus Jets.\nFollowing the 1954 season, the Cardinals pulled out of Columbus, promoting their Omaha affiliate to replace the Red Birds in the American Association. Cooper led a group that purchased the struggling Ottawa Athletics and Red Bird Stadium. From 1955 to 1968, he would serve as GM of the rechristened Columbus Jets, once again earning Minor League Executive of the Year honors in 1965. Cooper stepped down in 1968 to begin a 17-year run as a Commissioner of Franklin County. Two years later, the Jets were relocated to Charleston when Columbus refused to allocate funds to refurbish the then 39-year-old Jets Stadium.\nColumbus Clippers.\nIn 1977, Cooper persuaded his fellow commissioners to purchase and renovate the stadium, which was renamed Franklin County Stadium. The renamed Columbus Clippers returned from Charleston, with the county taking the unique step of buying the affiliate itself from the Pittsburgh Pirates for $25,000. The gamble paid off; as of 2016, Forbes valued the team at $41 million, and the team made a profit for the county of $1.33 million in 2015.\nWhile still serving as a County Commissioner, Cooper became president of the International League in 1978, a post he held for 12 years. From 1988 to 1989, he served as commissioner of the Triple-A Alliance, an interleague partnership between the International League and American Association. In 1984, the old ballpark he watching being built as a child was renamed Cooper Stadium in recognition of his contributions to baseball in Columbus. When the Clippers outgrew Cooper Stadium in 2009, they erected a statue of Cooper, entitled \"The Father of Columbus Baseball\", at the main entrance of their new home, Huntington Park."

        "title": "Albert Burke (tennis)",
        "text": "Albert Burke (1901–1958) was a French-born professional tennis player of Irish descent who described himself as British but was classed as a representative of Ireland and, on other occasions, of France when playing in international tournaments. In 1924 and 1925 he won the Bristol Cup tournament, which was at that time the principal competition for tennis professionals.\nFamily.\nAlbert Burke, born at Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1901, was a son of Thomas Burke, one of the earliest tennis professionals. His father had been the tennis coach at Dublin's Lansdowne Club (where the champions Joshua Pim and Frank Stoker were among those he guided) before moving to France in 1897 at the behest of Victor Voss. Thomas Burke became tutor at the Tennis Club de Paris and in 1898, on winning matches on the club's covered court against fellow professionals George Kerr (Fitzwilliam, Dublin) and Tom Fleming (Queen's, London), he was acclaimed \"the world's professional tennis champion\". He was still popularly known as such in March 1906, but was said to be \"formerly\" world champion by the end of that year. In 1900 he became coach at Nice Lawn Tennis Club and later relocated to Cannes where he worked under contract to the Hotel Metropole before becoming senior professional at the Carlton Lawn Tennis Club there. He was also active in Paris and at Le Touquet and was engaged to teach tennis to the Prince of Wales in 1912.\nThomas's three sons, Tommy, Albert and Edmund, were all raised to succeed their father in the game. The eldest, Tommy, was already playing professionally by February 1914 when, aged 13, he played a set against the former British Prime Minister Arthur Balfour at Cannes. He was subsequently eclipsed by Albert and by Edmund, the latter enjoying a long and consistent professional career but without matching Albert's degree of success.\nCareer.\nAlbert coached at the Lawn Tennis Club of Marseille in 1920 but soon after, following the death of his father, he returned to the Carlton Club's seven court-complex at Cannes. In 1922 he won the international professional invitation tournament at Lloyd Park, Walthamstow (sponsored by the \"News of the World\"), defeating Joseph Negro in straight sets in the semi-final and overcoming Charles Read of Queen's Club in the final \"after a magnificent contest that lasted two and a half hours\".\nWhen organising tournaments at the Carlton Courts he was able to attract the best players of the day, both professional and amateur, and in the course of a 1923 competition four hundred and twenty matches were played there in the course of a single week. These included a “memorable” contest between Suzanne Lenglen and Elizabeth Ryan and a match between Burke and the Frenchman Henri d'Arsonville, then regarded as the world professional champion. The latter encounter attracted heavy betting on its outcome, \"thrilled a large audience and ended in a win for the French player\". In 1925 Burke, partnered by Lenglen, played in an exhibition match against René Lacoste and Yvonne Bourgeois at Nice.\nAlbert Burke won the Bristol Cup in France in 1924 and 1925, beating Roman Najuch in both finals. He was also losing finalist in the Bristol Cup in 1926, 1929 and 1931, defeated in all three finals by Karel Koželuh.\nIn the absence of Koželuh he won the Deauville tournament in 1927, meeting Joseph Negro, Howard Kinsey and his own brother Edmund in the final pool, and beating them all without losing a set. On account of this victory he was saluted as \"champion of the world\", and he was the acknowledged Champion of France when, in the following year, he played in the 1928 Bristol Cup competition and appeared at the World Professional Singles Championship at Queen's Club, defeating the title holder, Dan Maskell, in the third round. Playing against his brother Edmund and their assistant coach at Cannes, Robert Ramillon, Albert won the doubles final at Queen's with Roman Najuch as his partner, but it was Ramillon who defeated Edmund to take the singles title.\nBurke finished second in the 1930 French Pro Championship round robin, while Karel Koželuh was the winner. At the US Pro Tennis Championships Burke was a quarter finalist in 1931 (losing to Howard Kinsey) and 1932 (losing to Bill Tilden). In 1931, at an exhibition match at Crawford Notch, he had defeated Tilden in what was described as \"the best feat of his career\".\nAt the 1935 Wembley Championships, Burke lost in the quarter finals to Ellsworth Vines. The following year he partnered Henri Cochet to the doubles title at the French Professional Championships.\nDeath.\nBurke died at Cannes on 22 November 1958, aged 57. A newspaper report of his death recalled that his tennis pupils had included the Duke of Edinburgh and Rita Hayworth."

Voyce was announced as a member of the British Isles team to tour South Africa, and played in 12 games during the tour, including two of the four test matches against South Africa. Initially overlooked as a test player, Voyce played his way into the side and took over kicking duties, ending as the tour's top points scorer with 37 points. His versatility saw appearances as a wing and full-back to cover injuries, as well as his usual position in the back row.\nVoyce was made Gloucester's club captain ahead of the 1924–25 season, a role he held for three seasons. His final appearance as a player for Gloucester was in November 1927.\nPost-playing rugby career.\nFollowing his retirement from playing, he held a number of administrative roles, including as President of the Rugby Football Union from 1960 to 1961. He was President of Gloucester RFC between 1970 and 1978. In the 1962 New Year Honours, Voyce was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) \"for services to sport and for public services in Gloucestershire\"."

On the same May 24, all three players were suspended from the team. On May 25, head coach Rimas Kurtinaitis said that it was not the first time when all three players were behaving unprofessionally and that they were ignoring previous warnings. Some witnesses noted that Taylor Brown previously was also consuming drugs. Not surprisingly, the team has shown no interest in keeping Brown for his second season and the contract was terminated by noting that character and devotion are essential properties for the players.\nBrown joined Liga ACB side Real Betis Energía Plus on August 25, 2017.

        "title": "Hamburg Rugby Union",
        "text": "Hamburg Rugby Union (Hamburger Rugby Verband (HHRV)) is the head organization of the rugby teams in and around Hamburg. The HHRV is the professional association in the Hamburg sports federation as well as the national association of the governing body of rugby union in Germany (Deutschen Rugby-Verband (DRV)).\nHistory.\nFrom the turn of the century until 1925.\nIn the second half of the nineteenth century, enthusiasm for the English football game slowly took hold of German youth. In many cities (such as Stuttgart, Heidelberg and Hannover) the first pioneers began to play football according to the laws of rugby. However, they faced opposition from the outset from members of association football who were in the majority in Hamburg. The first record of rugby activity can be seen as early as the 1880s, which continued right up until the early twentieth century. In 1913, Hamburg Rugby Club competed in a match against Hannover FC in 1897 but lost 3:11. The Hamburg Sports Club (since 1925) and the Hamburg Police Sports Club (SV Polizei) (1924–2005) were the first long-term active clubs that are still active to this day.\nUp to World War II.\nIt was not until the 1935/1936 season that the first regional championship took place. Numerous clubs from Hamburg and other north German cities, such as Wilhelmshaven, Lüneburg and Kiel competed for the then \"Nordmarkmeisterschaft\". Kiel's navy team was the first title holder. Hamburg's record-holder is FC St. Pauli rugby team, founded in 1933, who held a total of 33 titles from 1937 to 1996.\n1945–1960s – the founding years.\nRestarting after World War II was difficult, but with the positive help of many fixtures organised with teams from British occupation troops, the Hamburg Rugby Association could be established in 1952. Until then, rugby was a special division of the Hamburg Football Association. Among the founding members of the new rugby club were numerous clubs from the Hamburg sports scene: FC St.Pauli, Hamburg Rugby Club, HSV, Hamburg Police Sports Club, ASK, ETV, Altona 93, SV St. Georg, Fichte Langenhorn and Uhlenhorster Hockeyclub.\nSince the 1970s – the formation of the Bundesliga.\nAfter the introduction of the Bundesliga in 1971, a more structured form of rugby appeared in Germany, during which Hamburg lost its excellence status. FC St. Pauli (1971–1975 and 1988–1990), SV Polizei (1972–1973), HSV (1978–1979) were able to maintain their titles for a short term. FC St. Pauli and Hamburg rugby club have been playing in the first Bundesliga (north) division since the 2012/13 season. Hamburg's women's team has also been successful. St. Pauli's women's team, founded in 1989, has won eight championships since 1995. More than 20 national players have since emerged from this team. In addition, the club is the only club in Germany to establish an U16 girls' team. Combined with FC St. Pauli (with around 600 members), Hamburg rugby is home to Germany's largest rugby club.\nIn 2006 the club reached another milestone: Hamburg rugby club gained the sole rights of use of the Hamburg Rugby Arena. With the deal of the rugby arena finalized, the Hamburg rugby organization, along with its affiliated clubs, went on to organize the athletic and administrative processes in the arena on Saarlandstraße in Hamburg Stadtpark. After further negotiations with the city of Hamburg, Hamburg rugby club was pleased to announce that the rugby pitch in Barmwisch, Hamburg- Bramfeld and the training ground 'Am Bären' at the Südring in Hamburg's Stadtpark was available for its members use.\nAfter more than 44 years, the Hamburg Rugby organization set up a national match between Germany and Sweden on 6 April 2013, giving more than 3,500 spectators a glimpse of the potential successes of German rugby. In the same year there was an international youth meeting in Israel between the U18 selection of the Hamburg rugby club and the Kibbutz Yizre'el Rugby Club, which the Hamburg senate subsidized. Likewise, the senate was more than happy to support the men's and youth team's visits to Hansestadt in 2005, 2008 and 2012.\nOrganization and structure.\nMembers.\nThe club had approximately 1180 members across 10 different teams. \nEvents.\nHoliday activities for children.\nHamburg's rugby organization has been coordinating a rugby holiday camp in Hamburg StadtPark since 2011 as part of Hansestadt's holiday campaign. During the 2014 summer holidays, over 70 children took part. Some representatives of Hamburg rugby club were also responsible for organizing the \"Sport Rallye\" for the 100th anniversary of Hamburg Stadtpark. This was organised together with the Stadtpark, the Administration for Urban Development and the Environment (BSU), the Hamburg sports office and other surrounding associations."

        "text": "The 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup Final was a rugby union match to determine the winner of the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup, played between reigning champions England and New Zealand on 26 August 2017 at Kingspan Stadium in Belfast. New Zealand won the Rugby World Cup for a record fifth time, beating England 41–32.\nRoute to the final.\nEngland was the only team in the competition to be made up of professional rugby players, whereas New Zealand had just six players contracted.\nNew Zealand was placed in Pool A with Canada, Hong Kong and Wales. England was in Pool B alongside USA, Spain and Italy. On 10 August England played their first game of the tournament against Spain and ran in ten tries, including a hat-trick to Kay Wilson, to record a 56–5 victory. New Zealand played Wales the same day and led 20–0 at half time before extending the final margin to 44–12, with Selica Winiata scoring a hat-trick of her own. New Zealand continued their dominance with a 121–0 thrashing of Hong Kong in their next game. They scored 19 tries in total, with eight of them coming from winger Portia Woodman. England's second match saw them score the same number of tries and points as their first one as they downed Italy 56–13. Despite the two victories, concerns were raised over their kicking as in both matches they only converted three of the ten tries. England's final pool game was against the USA and they played a dominant first half to lead 33–7, before the Americans fought back to a close the final score to 47–36. The result meant that both teams would advance to the semi-finals. New Zealand played Canada in their last pool game and with another hat-trick, this time from front rower Aldora Itunu, New Zealand came away 48–5 victors.\nIn the semi-finals New Zealand took on USA and England played Pool C winner France. The USA team put in a good first half effort to only trail by eight points going into the break. They visibly fatigued in the second half though and New Zealand pulled away to claim a 45–12 victory. New Zealand scored seven tries in total, with Woodman again starring with four of them. Kelly Brazier was named Player of the Match for her playmaking and ball handling skills. England overcame France 20–3 in their semi-final. At half time, nothing separated the two teams as they each scored a solitary penalty in wet Belfast conditions. In the second half, two 20 year-olds (Sarah Bern and Megan Jones) scored the games only tries and put the game out of France's reach. It was a much closer match than the final score indicated, with Jones's try coming in the final minutes and not long after the French had narrowly missed scoring one themselves.\nMatch.\nAssistant referees:\nHollie Davidson (Scotland)\nGraham Cooper (Australia)\nTelevision match official:\nSimon McDowell (Ireland)\nSummary.\nEngland won the battle up front in the first half, holding onto possession and keeping New Zealand inside their 22 for most of it. However, New Zealand were the first to score when a cross-field kick from Victoria Subritzky-Nafatali was claimed by Selica Winiata setting up her first try. Emily Scarratt, who was playing at fullback instead of in her regular center spot, responded by making a break into New Zealand's 22 and then scored a penalty from a resulting dangerous tackle. In the 20th minute New Zealand's Sarah Goss was sin-binned for a tip tackle on Katy McLean and England nearly scored only for Alex Matthews to be held up over the tryline. They were eventually rewarded for their dominance, earning a penalty try from the resulting scrum. Lydia Thompson scored England's second try seven minutes later following a break from Rachael Burford. Just before half time New Zealand finally secured enough possession to string together some attacking phases, allowing prop Toka Natua to score. Despite the early momentum being with England, New Zealand trailed by just seven points at half time.\nNew Zealand played a much better second half. After being awarded a penalty early, they chose to kick to the corner and from the resulting lineout, Subritzky-Nafatali helped set up Natua's second try of the evening. With a successful conversion the scores were now level. England worked their way back into New Zealands half and were awarded a penalty that Scarratt managed to convert to edge them ahead. Lock Charmaine Smith pulled New Zealand ahead with a try in the 53rd minute, before England struck back through another Thompson score. \nEngland held a narrow one point lead. Three minutes later Natua scored her hat-trick try, then Kendra Cocksedge and Winiata crossed in quick succession to give New Zealand a 16-point lead with 11 minutes to play. With four minutes remaining Lesley Ketu was sin binned helping Izzy Noel-Smith score a consolation try for England near the end. The final score was 41–32 and New Zealand had won their fifth title to go with 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 victories.\nNatua was named player of the match for her three tries. New Zealand's captain Fiao'o Fa'amausili was proud of how her team got themselves back into the game, while England's captain Sarah Hunter complimented New Zealand on their second half performance."

An international roller derby tournament, it was organised by a committee consisting of ten representatives from various areas of the roller derby community.\nSome teams selected their skaters as early as October 2016, when the tournament was expected to be held in 2017.\nUSA Roller Derby successfully defended their title, defeating Team Australia in the final.\nParticipating teams.\nTeams representing 38 countries participated. While most national teams are representing a country in the conventional sense, the members of Team Indigenous comprise skaters of Indigenous heritage from Canada, the United States, Argentina, New Zealand and Samoa. The Korean team does not specify North or South Korea in its name.\nTournament structure.\nThe tournament ran on four tracks over four days, with an opening round of short, 30-minute games on the first day to determine seedings for the second and third days, via a ranking algorithm. \nThe second and third days saw two additional games for each team (for a total of four games guaranteed for all participants), resulting in a final rating and ranking by the same algorithm. The top eight teams in that ranking proceeded to an 8-way elimination tournament, with losing teams playing additional games for final ranking. The teams in positions ninth through sixteenth played one additional game for final ranking. (This system is essentially, a modified Swiss-system tournament for the first three days, with strengths for matchings derived from a power ranking, and Fontes-style matching of multiple games between recalculation of strengths.)\nExhibition matches.\nIn addition to competition matches, three exhibition matches were played during the tournament.\nBroadcast.\nThe entire weekend was broadcast online via pay-per-view streaming, and the tournament's fourth day was additionally carried on BBC Sport."

Able to shake free of that trend, Georgia State would beat Troy handily in the second round, 73–51, after losing to them twice in the regular season. \nIn their semifinal game, the Panthers were once again pitted against in-state foe, Georgia Southern. The teams split their regular season contests– each winning at home. On this neutral court, GSU would defeat the Eagles 73–67 and eliminate their rival from the SBC Tournament for the second time in four years. This rivalry game wouldn't end without some theatrics– with less than a minute to play, Georgia Southern cut State's lead to just three points. The Panthers held the ball while the shot clock ran down to two seconds, at which point the Eagles were called for a kicked ball off of an attempted Georgia State pass. As a result, the shot clock would reset to 20 seconds– with just 23 seconds left on the game clock. The Panthers called a time out, where Coach Hunter said he reminded his team of the new shot clock differential and instructed them to hold the ball until fouled should they successfully inbound the ball. Once play resumed, the inbound pass was received by junior Devin Mitchell, who would later claim he thought Coach Hunter was talking about the game clock, and therefore still thought only two seconds remained on the shot clock, leading him to immediately turn around and shoot the ball from outside of the three-point arc and sink an unnecessary three-pointer. This mishap would ice the game, sending the Panthers to the SBC Tournament finals. Meanwhile, top-seeded (and regular season champions) Louisiana dropped their semifinal game to 5th seed UT-Arlington, sending the Mavericks, a team Georgia State lost to just five games earlier, to face the Panthers in the finals.\nThe Panthers would handle UT-Arlington in the finals with relative ease, beating them 74–61, with the help of D'Marcus Simonds' game-high 27 points. Their SBC Tournament victory would give the Panthers the Sun Belt Conferences' automatic bid to the NCAA tournament. Selected as a 15-seed, Georgia State was matched with the 2nd-seeded Cincinnati Bearcats for their opening game in Nashville, TN.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Sun Belt Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Sun Belt tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| NCAA tournament"

        "title": "Final Five (gymnastics)",
        "text": "The Final Five was the United States women's team in artistic gymnastics that won the team event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. It was the United States' third gold medal in the event and second outside the United States. The five members of the team were Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas, Laurie Hernandez, Madison Kocian, and Aly Raisman, with MyKayla Skinner, Ragan Smith, and Ashton Locklear serving as the three alternates. After the team event, Biles won a gold medal in the individual all-around event, the vault, and on floor exercise and won a bronze on the balance beam, while Raisman won silver medals in the individual all-around, and on the floor exercise, where she was the defending champion, Hernandez won silver on the balance beam, and Kocian won a silver in the uneven bars. The previous team to medal in every event, including the team and individual all-around, was the Unified Team at the 1992 Games; the only previous U.S. team to do so was at the 1984 Games.\nTeam background.\nRaisman and Douglas were both part of the gold medal winning team, dubbed the Fierce Five, at the 2012 London Olympics where Douglas won gold in the all-around and Raisman won gold on the floor event and bronze on the balance beam.\nBiles won gold at the 2013 World Championships in the individual all-around and on floor exercise. She also won silver on vault and bronze on balance beam.\nBiles and Kocian were part of the 2014 World Championship gold medal winning team. Biles additionally won gold in the all-around, on floor exercise, and on balance beam. She also won silver on vault.\nBiles, Raisman, Douglas, and Kocian were all part of the 2015 World Championship gold medal winning team. Biles won gold in the all-around and Douglas won the silver. Biles also won gold on floor exercise and balance beam and won bronze on the vault. Kocian won gold on the uneven bars in a four way tie. Thus making Biles the reigning world champion in all-around, floor, and balance beam and Kocian the reigning world co-champion on the uneven bars going into the Olympics. Additionally Biles was the reigning national champion as well.\nAly Raisman, the captain of the Fierce Five, was once again selected as team captain.\nBiles was chosen by Team USA to be the flag bearer for the closing ceremonies. She was the first American female gymnast to be given the honor.\nOlympic Trials.\nThe Women's Gymnastics Olympic Trials took place on Friday, July 8 and Sunday, July 10, 2016 at the SAP Center in San Jose, California.\nAt the 2016 U.S. Olympic Trials, Biles, Hernandez, and Raisman finished first, second, and third respectively in the all-around competition. Biles finished first on vault and floor exercise, Kocian finished first on the uneven bars, Hernandez finished first on the balance beam. MyKayla Skinner, Ragan Smith, and Ashton Locklear were selected as the three alternates. Full Olympic Trial scores are as follows:\nNickname.\nThe name \"Final Five\" was chosen by the team members. At the 2012 London Games, the team had adopted the nickname \"Fierce Five\" in response to the media-bestowed nickname \"Fab Five\". The 2016 nickname was not announced until the team had secured victory in the team event. The name has two meanings: one being that this is the last Olympics where gymnastics teams will be made up of five members (starting in 2020 teams will consist of only four) and the other being that it was the final gymnastics team to be formed under Marta Karolyi as national team coordinator of USA Gymnastics.\n2016 Summer Olympics.\nQualifications.\nThe United States qualified in first place with an overall score of 185.238, nearly 10 points ahead of second place China who received a score of 175.279. Biles, Douglas, and Raisman competed on all four events. Hernandez competed on vault, balance beam, and floor exercise. Kocian competed only on uneven bars. For the individual all-around competition, Biles, Raisman, and Douglas qualified in first, second, and third place, respectively. Due to the rule allowing only the top two from each country to compete in a World or Olympic individual final, only Biles and Raisman advanced. Douglas had won the all-around at the 2012 London Olympics.\nBiles qualified first on the vault, balance beam, and floor exercise; Kocian qualified first on the uneven bars; Raisman qualified second on the floor exercise; Hernandez qualified second on the balance beam; Douglas qualified third on the uneven bars. Additionally Douglas and Raisman both finished seventh on the balance beam; Hernandez finished fourth and Douglas finished ninth on floor exercise, but both failed to qualify to the finals due to the two per country rule.\nTeam Final.\nBiles, Raisman, and Hernandez each competed on vault, balance beam, and floor exercise. Kocian, Douglas, and Biles competed on uneven bars. The team scored 184.897, over eight points ahead of second place Russia. For each individual apparatus, the Final Five's combined scores were the highest.\nIndividual events.\nIn the individual all-around, Biles and Raisman each performed four clean routines, with Biles scoring the highest score on all but the uneven bars, as well as being the only gymnast that day to score above 15 on the balance beam. Biles took the gold medal, 2.1 points ahead of Raisman, who took the silver medal. With this, Biles and Raisman became the second pair of American gymnasts to go 1-2 in the individual all-around in the Olympics, after Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson took gold and silver respectively in 2008 in Beijing.\nIn the vault final, Biles, who was favored to win despite never winning a world title on the apparatus, won the gold medal, becoming the first American gymnast to win the vault title at an Olympic Games.\nAfter qualifying in 1st, Kocian performed cleanly and won the silver medal on uneven bars, finishing behind Russian gymnast and reigning Olympic uneven bars champion Aliya Mustafina. Douglas, who qualified in 3rd behind Kocian and Mustafina, respectively, made a mistake on one of her pirouettes and placed seventh.\nIn the balance beam final, Hernandez won the silver medal, finishing behind the Netherlands' Sanne Wevers. Biles suffered a shocking mishap when she put her hands on the beam after a balance check on her front tuck. Despite the mistake, her score was high enough to win her the bronze medal.\nCopying the results of the individual all-around, Biles and Raisman won gold and silver respectively in the floor exercise event final, competing the two highest difficulty routines in the competition.\nPost-Olympics.\nLaurie Hernandez competed on and won season 23 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was partnered with Valentin Chmerkovskiy.\nSimone Biles competed on season 24 of \"Dancing with the Stars\". She was partnered with Sasha Farber. They finished fourth. Farber later helped choreograph a floor exercise routine that Biles debuted in the 2021 U.S. Classic.\nMadison Kocian went on to compete at the collegiate level for the UCLA Bruins. She, along with Fierce Five member Kyla Ross, made history by becoming the first Olympic gold medalists to compete in NCAA gymnastics in a team managed and then later assistant coached by another Fierce Five member, Jordyn Wieber.\nAfter the Olympics, it came to light that all five of the Final Five, plus at least one of the three alternates, had been abused sexually, verbally, and/or emotionally while training in gymnastics. The prevalence of abuse in gymnastics was widely discussed in the media after the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal became public."

        "title": "American football in North Central Pennsylvania",
        "text": "American football in North Central Pennsylvania has a historic past. Football is the predominant sport in the region of Pennsylvania dating back to the early days of the sport. All levels of football, including high school football and college football, are followed passionately. North Central Pennsylvania does not have any professional football franchises.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1870–1944).\nAmerican football was first originated in the area in the late 1870s, when Pennsylvania State University and Bucknell University created programs. The first local recorded game occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University of Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby.\" Less than a year after this game some high Schools in the area adopted the game. The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the \"Mirror\" (University of Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Most high school games were not recorded so a specific date on when high school football actually originated in the area.\nWith the creation of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association in 1913 and other high school sport governing bodies being founded more specific records and rules were being brought about between the years 1897 and 1920. The earliest recorded high school football game in the area took place in 1883 however the exact date was not found nor the schools involved as the box school only said \"Green and Black\" not school names, nicknames or mascots.\nMassive growth (1945–1990).\nThe sport in the area saw massive growth after World War II. During the next 40 years after the war, high schools and colleges saw a massive spike in participation and fan support. Mostly due to the increased presence of media and state playoffs. The playoff bracket and post-season games drew large numbers of fans and supporters. During the 60s, 70s and 80s the sport saw the most growth in the area. Most schools, even small rural schools had a football program.\nDuring this time period is when most of the area's schools' rivalries came to fruition.\nModern years (1991–present).\nAfter the massive growth of the sport, football has continued its success in this region. Fans have continued to support their local schools or colleges in the area with a passion. Even though there is no professional franchise in the area many people root for either the Philadelphia Eagles or Pittsburgh Steelers.\nCollegiate level football.\nThe following chart shows area colleges football programs.\nHigh school level football.\nOf the 102 public high schools in the area 101 have football programs (as of June 2017). Games are played on Fridays, however some games are played on Saturday possibly due to travel or other inconveniences. Programs play a total of eleven regular season games heading into playoffs. A possible four more games leading up to the state championship games now played at Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The location was chosen due to its centralized location within the state.\nNotable players.\nMany notable American football players were born and grew up in the North Central Pennsylvania region."

        "title": "Sporting CP (volleyball)",
        "text": "Sporting Clube de Portugal is a professional volleyball team based in Lisbon, Portugal. It is the volleyball section of Sporting CP.\nHistory.\nVolleyball was introduced in Sporting Clube de Portugal in the thirties by influence of Salazar Carreira, constituting itself the club as one of the founders of the Association of Volleyball of Lisbon, 28 of December 1938.\nThe club would only reach its first titles in the fifties thanks to the dynamism of Professor Moniz Pereira, who was a manager, coach and player of the team that, in the 1953/54 season, broke the hegemony of the Instituto Superior Técnico that until then had conquered all National Championships, which were disputed since 1947. In addition to Moniz Pereira, the Yugoslavs Jost and Budisin, Xara Brazil, Marques Pereira, Fernando Fezas Vital, Machado da Costa, Anibal Rebelo and Plácido Martins.\nAt the women's level the first official competition began in June 1951, and Sporting Clube de Portugal was one of four clubs that took part in the competition, with the Lionesses being in second place. After a brilliant period with the achievement of the National Championships of 1953/54 and 1955/56, the modality declined, being fundamentally supported by successes at the training levels and at the feminine level, ending up being extinguished at the beginning of the 1964/65 season with the club's restructuring.\nAt the end of almost two decades of interregnum, the sport was again practiced in 1981/82, first only in the women's sector in the senior and junior years, so that the volleyball later returned in force to Sporting and to those that were the golden years of the modality in Alvalade, the 90s, with a team led by António Rodrigues, and with some of the best players of the time, such as Nilson Júnior, Carlos Natário, Miguel Maia, Wagner Silva, Luís Cláudio, Magrão, Filipe Vitó, Marcelo and Maurício Cavalcanti. Carlos Silveira, Miguel Soares and Américo Silva, Sporting was Tri-National Champion and won a Portuguese Cup and two Super Cups.\nIn the first half of the decade of 1990, to the referred conquests were added still more two Cups of Portugal and a Supertaca. However, the victorious momentum was abruptly interrupted at the beginning of the Roquete Project in 1995. One of the first measures of financial reorganization of the Board chaired by Santana Lopes was to end various high competition modalities, including Volleyball.\nIn November 1995, a group of coaches, athletes and their parents from the former section decided to found the Lisbon Volleyball Center, a non-profit sports institution dedicated to teaching and practicing the sport.\nOn 5 June 2017, Sporting Clube de Portugal officially announces that Volleyball will become part of Leon's eclecticism again, with the men's senior team competing in the First National Division in the 2017/18 season, with the undisputed Miguel Maia.\nFacilities.\nPavilhão João Rocha.\nPavilhão João Rocha is a multi-sports pavilion located in the parish of Lumiar, in Lisbon. Located next to the Estádio José Alvalade, it is the home of Sporting CP sports. In honor of one of the most distinguished figures in the history of Sporting, the pavilion was named after former club president, João Rocha, who remained in office from September 1973 to October 1986. Its inauguration took place on the day June 21, 2017.\nHonours.\nMen.\n1953–54, 1955–56, 1991–92, 1992–93, 1993–94, 2017–18\n1990–91, 1992–93, 1994–95, 2020–21, 2023-24\n1990–91, 1991–92, 1992–93\nWomen.\n1984–85, 1985–86\n1986–87\nRoster.\n\"Season 2020–2021, as of September 2020.\""

The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1. The tiers are shown below. Brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nThe following restrictions will apply to the draw:\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 8 June 2017, in Neuchâtel, Switzerland. \nTeams in the same pool play each other twice, at home and away, in the group stage that begins on the weekend of 13/14/15 October 2017, and continues through to 19/20/21 January 2018. The five pool winners and three best runners-up progress to the quarter-finals.\nTeams are awarded group points based on match performances. Four points are awarded for a win, two points for a draw, one attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and one defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers will be used, as directed by EPCR:\n(Q) denotes the team has qualified for the quarter-finals as the pool winners\n(q) denotes team has at least qualified for the quarter-finals as one of the three highest-scoring second-place teams"

Laing (born 1865), was a Scottish rugby union footballer of the 1880s, who played in Scotland for Hawick, and was selected to play at a representative level for the British Isles on the 1888 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia, the first tour by a team representing the British Isles. He later immigrated to the US, specifically to Buffalo, Wyoming, where he became a successful sheep farmer.\nEarly life and career.\nAlexander J Laing was born on 25 October 1865 in Hawick, Scotland, to Alexander Laing and Jane Milligan Dinwiddie. He had at least five younger siblings (Robert, Janet, Marjory, Mary and William). His father was a partner in a Tweed Merchants. He attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh.\nDomestic career.\nAlex Laing played for five seasons for Hawick RFC up to 1888. He was captain of the club in the 1887–1888 season and was also selected to play for his county side, Roxburgh. In addition he was selected to play for the South of Scotland when they played Edinburgh. He was described as \"\"one of the fastest forwards on the Borders\". In their appraisal of him, the Otago Witness also said that he was \"a good dribbler and a splendid tackler and is a very dangerous man near the goal line.\"\"\nBritish Isles.\nLaing played 26 times while on the 1888 tour but did not score any tries.\nLater life.\nDuring the 1888 tour, after the Brisbane match, Laing's Hawick teammate Bob Burnet made his made up to stay in Australia. Alex along with his other Hawick teammate Willie Burnet, returned to face questioning about their amateur status in Glasgow as soon as they returned. Along with the rest of the tour party, they were found not to have contravened the rules and in late November 1888 they returned to Hawick, apparently to a hero’s welcome. Laing emigrated in November 1889 to Buffalo, Wyoming, where he and Willie Burnet set up a successful sheep farming ranch. In Wyoming he married Flora, herself from Wyoming but whose father was from Canada and whose mother was from North Carolina. They had at least two daughters in Wyoming, Elizabeth and Margory. Laing was naturalized as a citizen of USA in November 1898 before the District Court of Sheridan County, Wyoming. By 1920 he had lived uninterruptedly in buffalo for 31 years where he had established himself as a stock grower, specializing in sheep, although in 1920 he did apply to import into the USA a shipment of pure bred cattle from Scotland."

The Test match at the Kensington Oval also became the first day/night Test to be played in the West Indies. Ahead of the Test matches, there was a three-day tour match. The Test series was drawn 1–1.\nOn 19 May 2018, Cricket West Indies (CWI) announced that they may scrap one of the Test fixtures, replacing it with a couple of one-day matches. However, the day before the first Test, the International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that it would be a three-match Test series. \nPrior to the start of day three of the second Test, the Sri Lankan cricket team protested against umpires' decision on starting the third day's play with a new ball, replacing the old ball. The Sri Lankan cricket team, led by Dinesh Chandimal, refused to take to the field on the third day of the Test, after showing its disagreement on changing the ball, causing play to be delayed by two hours. The ICC charged Chandimal with the offense of \"changing the condition of the ball\". Chandimal pled not guilty to the charge.

It was contested between a World XI team and Pakistan across three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. Pakistan won the series 2–1.\nSouth Africa's Faf du Plessis captained the World XI team, with Sarfaraz Ahmed leading Pakistan. Ten of the players in the Pakistan squad had not previously played in an international match at home. The World XI side arrived in Lahore a day before the first fixture under high security. The cup was named in commemoration of Pakistan's 70th year of independence.\nThe International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed Richie Richardson as the match referee for the fixtures, the first time the ICC has sent an official to oversee cricket matches in Pakistan since 2009. Aleem Dar, Ahsan Raza, Ahmed Shahab and Shozab Raza were appointed as the on-field umpires. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) introduced the #CricketKiHalalala hashtag for the series.\nThe PCB spent an estimated $3 million to host the three matches, with players on the World XI team being paid approximately $100,000 each. The ICC contributed more than $1 million towards security costs. While attendance for the first two matches were as high as 90%, this was down on the crowd numbers for the final of the 2017 Pakistan Super League. Higher ticket pricing was to blame for the drop in attendance, with some tickets being given to local schools as a result. The ICC and PCB looked at the possibility for further World XI tours to Pakistan in the next two years, with the priority for more Full Member sides to tour.\nFollowing the conclusion of the series, Faf du Plessis said how much it meant for the people of Pakistan and that it hopefully will bring cricket back to the country. Sarfraz Ahmed said that he was thankful to the World XI team and that \"I expect these players to return back to Pakistan with full squads to play a full Test series\". The ICC congratulated Pakistan for hosting the tournament, with the aim to get bilateral international cricket returning to Pakistan. The following month, the Sri Lanka cricket team played a T20I in Lahore against Pakistan."

On 24 August 2017 Victoria withdrew its bid to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, leaving only Birmingham and Liverpool in the race.\nBackground.\nOn 30 June 2017, Victoria officially announced its bid to host the games. Bid committee chair David Black announced the bid was submitted with letters of support from the provincial government, local municipalities and the University of Victoria. Lisa Helps, the mayor of Victoria, revealed on 30 April 2017 that the City of Victoria was exploring a possible bid for the 2022 Commonwealth Games. Victoria last hosted the 1994 Commonwealth Games. Vancouver, which is also in British Columbia, hosted the 1954 Commonwealth Games and 2010 Winter Olympic Games and Paralympic Games.\nOn 24 August 2017 B.C. Finance Minister Carole James announced in a statement that the province won't contribute funding to a 2022 Commonwealth Games bid because there were too many uncertainties. She cited question marks surrounding the bid, including revenue commitments, venue locations, costs for security – which weren’t including in the bid committee’s cost estimate – and any added costs like transit, infrastructure and health services for athletes. The government agreed, with James saying they were dealing with too many other crises including one of B.C’s worst wildfire seasons in history. James suggested to bid for the 2030 Commonwealth Games.\nCost.\nThe total cost of the Victoria 2022 Commonwealth Games was anticipated to be in the region of $955 million with $400 million expected to come from the Government of Canada, $400 million from the province, $25 million from local municipalities and $130 million from sponsorship deals to pay for the Games.\nVenues.\nFollowing were the venues proposed for the games:\nSee also.\nCommonwealth Games celebrated in Canada"

        "text": "The Gimnasia y Esgrima basketball section is part of the Argentine sports club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata. The professional senior team currently competes in La Liga Argentina de Básquet (former \"Torneo Nacional de Ascenso\"), the second division of Argentine basketball league system.\nGimnasia y Esgrima plays its home venues at Polideportivo Víctor Nethol, a multi-purpose stadium with capacity of 3,000.\nHistory.\nBasketball was practiced for the first time at the club in the 1920s. In 1924 the institution built a stadium on the corner of 60 and 118 streets. Since that time, it would become one of the major sports in the club.\nIn December 1970, Gimnasia y Esgrima went to a tour on Europe. The team participated in the \"Torneo de Navidad\" (Christmas Tournament) organised by Spanish club Real Madrid. Gimnasia finished 3rd (of 4) after beating Puerto Rico national team 87–82 and lost to Real Madrid (title holder) 83–64 and Joventut Badalona. Coached by Miguel Angel Ripullone, touring players were: Marcelo Arnal, Eduardo \"Tato\" Bava, Orlando \"Chungo\" Butta, Ernesto Gehrmann, Santos Melluso, Adolfo \"Gurí\" Perazzo, Carlos Ratier, Carlos \"Gallego\" González, Jorge Becerra, Gustavo Chazarreta, Carlos Pellandini. Gimnasia y Esgrima also played Spanish team Santander and Italian side Asti.\nThe basketball team peaked during the 1978 and 1979 campaigns, when it won two Metropolitano championships. In both cases, team prevailed over favorite Obras Sanitarias, Argentina's powerhouse at the time. The team included players such as \"Gallego\" González, \"Finito\" Gehrmann, Peinado, as well as some Americans: Michael Jackson, Lawrence Jackson Jr., and the team leader and star, point-guard Clarence Edgar Metcalfe, chosen as the league MVP in 1979. The twice-champions were coached by Rolando Sfeir.\nAfter the 1993–94 season, Gimnasia promoted to Torneo Nacional de Ascenso (TNA), the second division. In the following season, the team finished 6th (of 16). At the end of 1996–97, Gimnasia played a relegation series against Atlético Echagüe of Paraná, Entre Ríos, finally winning the series and remaining in the division. In 1999–2000 and being coached by Adrián Gómez, GELP reached the finals v Belgrano (Tucumán), losing 3–2. Belgrano promoted to LNB, the first division. Nevertheless, the following season Gimnasia achieved promotion to Primera after beating Regatas Corrientes 3–1 in the final series. Some notable players were Fabián Horvath, Javier Bulfoni, Walter Storani, Roberto López, Boubacar Aw, and Pop Thorton.\nGimnasia was also runner-up in the 2003–04 Liga Nacional de Básquetbol's Primera División tournament, when it was defeated by Boca Juniors 4–2 in the final series.\nIn the following season, the team was relegated to the TNA (Second Division) after president Juan José Muñoz decreased substantially the basketball budget, thereby causing the loss of its principal players.\nVenue.\nGimnasia y Esgrima plays its home venues at Polideportivo Víctor Nethol, a multi-purpose stadium with capacity of 3,000. It is placed in the club headquarters, on Calle 4.\nWhen the team started in 1924, the squad played at a basketball court located in 60 and 188 streets. It was also rebuilt on the same place. From 1937 to 1978 GyE played its games at the club's headquarters. The \"Polideportivo\" has held basketball games since 1978."

Following the conclusion of the series, Pakistan's captain Sarfaraz Ahmed said that \"no team will be using security concerns as an excuse in the future. This year or the next year, (international) cricket will come back to Pakistan\". The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) were hoping to play a full international series against a Full Member side in Pakistan by 2020.\nIt was the first tour in Pakistan of more than one match against another Test nation since Zimbabwe toured in May 2015. In October 2017, Sri Lanka played a T20I match against Pakistan in Lahore.\nOriginally, the fixtures were scheduled to be played in November 2017. However, early in November 2017, reports announced that the West Indies team would not be travelling to Pakistan over security concerns. The PCB chairman Najam Sethi stated that the original schedule was changed due to unforeseen weather, logistic issues and challenges with security. In March 2018, the PCB confirmed that the fixtures would take place in April at the National Stadium in Karachi. The last time an international cricket match was played at the venue in Karachi was in February 2009, when Sri Lanka toured Pakistan. That series was cut short, following an attack on the Sri Lanka cricket team in Lahore.\nCricket West Indies (CWI) offered an extra pay incentive to players to tour Pakistan. With only three days left before the tour started, the West Indies named a weakened squad to tour Pakistan. Jason Mohammed was named as captain of the West Indies, as the regular T20I captain, Carlos Brathwaite did not travel because of security concerns. Along with Brathwaite, Jason Holder, Chris Gayle and Devendra Bishoo did not make themselves available, also because of security concerns.\nSquads.\nVeerasammy Permaul injured himself during the first match and was ruled out of the West Indies squad for the remaining two fixtures. No replacement was named to replace him."

        "text": "The World Series of Darts is a series of darts tournaments organised by the Professional Darts Corporation.\nBeginning in 2013, the World Series has comprised between two and seven tournaments across the world, where a mixture of the top-ranked PDC players take on local qualifiers in a knockout format. Since 2015, there has been a finals tournament held annually in November at the Braehead Arena in Glasgow, Scotland, although in 2018, it moved to the Multiversum Schwechat in Vienna, Austria, and moved again to the AFAS Live in Amsterdam, Netherlands in 2019, then to the Salzburgarena in Salzburg, Austria in 2020.\nHistory.\nThe World Series of Darts commenced in 2013 with the Dubai Duty Free Darts Masters. The goal of these series of tournaments is to make darts more popular across the globe.\nLater that year, the Sydney Darts Masters took place, which as well as including 8 top-ranked PDC players, also featured 8 players from Australia and New Zealand to take part in the tournament. In 2014, tournaments in Singapore and Perth were added to the series, although this would be the only year that Singapore was used for an event.\nIn 2015, both the Japan tournament (later renamed as Tokyo for the 2016 tournament) and Auckland were added. Also in 2015, the series was ended with the World Series of Darts Finals. In 2016, the PDC expanded into China with the addition of the Shanghai Darts Masters, and in 2017, both North America and Europe had their own tournaments with the US Darts Masters in Las Vegas, and the German Darts Masters in Düsseldorf, along with Melbourne over from Sydney in the Australian leg of the tour.\nIn 2018, Brisbane joined the fray and replaced Perth, whilst Dubai was excluded. It was also confirmed that Vienna, Austria would replace Glasgow as the host of the World Series Finals in 2018.\nIn 2019, it was announced that Cologne and Hamilton would host World Series events for the first time, with Dubai seemingly still on a back burner and China also excluded. It was also confirmed that Amsterdam, Netherlands would replace Vienna as the host of the World Series Finals in 2019.\nIn 2020 a new tournament, the Nordic Darts Masters, was due to take place in Copenhagen, Denmark. It was also confirmed that Salzburg, Austria will replace Amsterdam as the host of the World Series Finals in 2020. The two Australian events will move to Wollongong and Townsville.\nThe US Darts Masters will relocate to New York City in 2022, having been due to move in 2020 before the cancellation of the 2020 US Masters due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The events in Hamilton, Wollongong and Townsville will also play in 2022, but the only event in 2021 was the delayed Nordic Masters in Copenhagen, with the finals returning to Amsterdam in October 2021.\nVenues.\nSince the first tournament began in 2013, the World Series has visited ten countries including the Finals.\nPoints in the World Series tournament.\nSince the World Series of Darts Finals were announced in 2015, each event includes ranking points that all players earn dependent on how far they go to through each tournament. The top 8 ranked players automatically qualify for the Finals.\nFinalists.\n\"Up to and including the 2024 Dutch Darts Masters.\""

Alexander Stadium which will host the ceremonies and athletics will be renovated and the capacity will be increased from 12,000 to 50,000 seats. A 400-metre warm up track will also be developed. This would leave the stadium well placed to become the home of UK Athletics, hosting all the major national and international competitions after the Games."

        "text": "The World Dog Surfing Championships, officially the Norcal Dog Surfing event &amp; World Championships, is an annual dog surfing contest in Northern California, founded in 2016 and organized by TasteTV.\nCompetition.\nThe surfing contest is divided into up to four dog weight classes, plus a tandem dog and a tandem dog and human contest. There are also a fetch contest and a fashion show. Dogs surf with the assistance of a human who selects the wave or waves for the dog to ride. In the non-tandem portion of the contest, first, second, and third place are awarded in each weight class based on ride length, technique, and attitude as well as wave size during a ten-minute heat, and the top two dogs in each class then compete for the Top All-Around Surfing Championship Awards. The event raises money for animal, surfing, and environmental charities.\nHistory.\n2016.\nThe first World Dog Surfing Championships, the first dog surfing event in Northern California, took place on September 10, 2016, at Linda Mar Beach in Pacifica, California. Only five dogs competed, in two weight classes; Abbie Girl, an Australian Kelpie originally rescued through Humane Society Silicon Valley, won the overall competition over her friend Brandy, a Pug.\n2017.\nThe second annual championship event was held on August 5, 2017, again at Linda Mar Beach in Pacifica. There were three dozen entrants; Abbie again won the overall prize, with Sampson, a Spaniel, second. Humpback whales breached offshore during the surfing. Video of Simon McCoy's unenthusiastic presentation of the story for BBC News was widely shared.\n2018.\nAt the 2018 event, held on August 4, again at Linda Mar beach in Pacifica, there were 45 contestants. Gidget, a Pug, won Top Dog and Abbie Girl, whose owner competed with one foot in a cast, received the newly added Spirit of Surfing Award; Shredder of the Year and All Heart awards were also introduced for the first time.\n2019.\nThe 2019 event took place on August 3, again at Linda Mar Beach in Pacifica, with approximately 50 contestants. Cherie, a French Bulldog from Newport Beach, won the Medium Surf Dogs and Top Dogs awards.\n2020.\nThe 2020 championships, scheduled for August 1, were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. A livestream hybrid event took place on September 26, using Zoom for live heats.\n2021.\nThe in-person championships scheduled for August 28, 2021 in Pacifica were again postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic; livestreamed championships were scheduled for October 2.\n2022.\nThe 2022 event was held at Linda Mar beach in Pacifica on August 6. The Top Dog award was won by Skyler, a Cattle Dog from Santa Cruz.\n2023.\nThe 2023 championships took place on August 5 at Linda Mar beach in Pacifica, in unusually choppy conditions. Faith, a Pit Bull, won the solo surfing event in the large dogs division, Cherie, a French Bulldog, in the medium dogs division, and Carson, a Terrier, and Delilah tied for first place for small dogs. Carson won Top Dog."

First organized with both men's and women's races, the men's race was discontinued after the 2018 edition; the Classic was held as a women-only event in 2019. The men's version of the race was designated as 2.HC and was part of the UCI America Tour. In 2017, the race was long and was held in Colorado Springs, Breckenridge, and Denver. In 2018, the first two stages were in Vail (August 16–17) and the last two were in Denver (August 18–19). The Denver stages were accompanied by a music and cycling fan fest extravaganza called Velorama.\nIn December 2018, the organizers announced that the Classic would become a women-only race from 2019 forward. As part of the change, the women's purse was increased from $20,000 in 2018 to $75,000 for 2019—which was $5,000 more than the purse for the final men's Classic in 2018. The Classic became the only standalone women's stage race in the Western Hemisphere included in the official UCI calendar; the 2019 edition was the first to be part of USA Cycling's Pro Road Tour and is classified as a 2.1 race by the UCI. The race has not been held since 2019; the 2020 edition was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic and further races failed to attract a title sponsor."

Eustachy had previously been reprimanded by the university in 2017 for the same type of behavior from a 2014 university led investigation. On February 8, players boycotted practice because of the lack of communication from the athletic department as to the situation. On the same day, it was reported that Eustachy would be fired by the school.\nThe Rams were initially led by assistant coach Steve Barnes for the first 2 games of Eustachy's absence. However, prior to the team's home game against San Jose State on February 10, he was also placed on administrative leave.

        "text": "Real Madrid Rugby was the rugby union section of Spanish Real Madrid C.F. Established in 1924, the team achieved 4 unofficial regional titles and 1 Copa del Rey title in 1934, before being closed in 1948.\nAlthough the section is currently extinct, there were some attempts to re-introduce the practise of rugby, but they were not finally carried out, including an unsuccessful agreement with rugby club CRC Madrid to have a team representing them at División de Honor, the first division of Spanish rugby.\nHistory.\nThe rugby section of Real Madrid was established by some young members of the club, with former footballer Eulogio Aranguren among them. On 10 January 1925, the squad played its first match v. Atlético Madrid in the Stadium Metropolitano, which was won by Real Madrid 27–0. During its first years of existence, Real Madrid Rugby played at different venues, such as Chamartín, El Estadio, El Campo de Los Suizos and Canillejas.\nOn 25 January 1925, Real Madrid played Infantry Academy of Toledo at Estadio Chamartín, with a new win for Real Madrid by 23–9. After the match, the team was also awarded its first trophy.\nAt regional level, Real Madrid Rugby won four consecutive Campeonato Regional Centro, during the first years of the 1930s.\nIn 1934, Real Madrid won its first national title, the Copa del Rey de Rugby, after defeating Universitario de Valencia by 14–6. It would be its only title in that competition. Some of the most notable players of that final were fly-half Carlos García San Miguel and Ramón Resines.\nAfter a hiatus due to the Civil War (1936–39), the rugby section of Real Madrid fell in popularity and was discontinued in 1948. In an attempt to bring the sport back to the club, in 2008 Real Madrid made arrangements with rugby club CRC Madrid (also known as CRC Pozuelo) to be represented in the Spanish premier league, División de Honor. When the agreement was about to be signed, president of Real Madrid Ramón Calderón, who had been the main architect of the return of rugby to the club, resigned from his role following allegations of vote-rigging for the confirmation for the financial budget. Real Madrid exploded into a crisis that suspended many projects and operations in the club, including the rugby section.\nWith the coming of Florentino Pérez to the club for a second term, past negotiations were not resumed. Therefore, rugby section has remained inactive since then.\nAfter that, Atlético de Madrid made a deal with CRC Madrid to have a rugby team in the División de Honor. The CRC squad agreed to use the name, shield and colors of Atlético Madrid during the time the agreement was in force."

Chrisann Gordon pulled Jamaica close to Nigeria on the inside but lost some ground coming off the turn. Down the home stretch, George faded while Quanera Hayes brought USA into the lead at the handoff to Allyson Felix. Felix ran a fast turn to put some separation on the field by the break. Further outside, Jamaica's Anneisha McLaughlin-Whilby was the next in contention until about 50 metres into her leg she McLaughlin-Whilby began to hop and lean back in pain. The entire field passed her as she tried to continue to the break line before collapsing to the track. Felix and USA had a 20-metre lead over the next best, Nigeria, a metre ahead of Great Britain.\nFelix continued to expand the lead. Down the homestretch, Laviai Nielsen ran GBR past Nigeria's Abike Funmilola Egbeniyi, but USA had already passed to Shakima Wimbley almost four seconds before the other teams arrived. Iga Baumgart ran around the outside and after the handoff Aleksandra Gaworska, Poland was behind GBR's Eilidh Doyle breaking away from the other teams. 25 metres behind USA, Doyle opened up almost five metres on Gaworska but on the home stretch Doyle began to fade, Gaworska came back while Wimbley was speeding away. USA passed to world champion Phyllis Francis for their anchor. Over five seconds later, GBR passed to Emily Diamond slightly ahead of Poland's pass to Justyna Święty. Francis continued to expand the lead. Behind her Diamond opened up as much as a 10-metre gap on Święty while Nigeria's Yinka Ajayi and France's Elea-Mariama Diarra almost catching her from behind by the half way mark. Francis finished six seconds ahead of Diamond, a virtual walkover gold for USA, with Święty closing rapidly on the homestretch to get Poland close to GBR by the finish.\nThe 5.98 second margin of victory was the largest in World Championship history.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification criteria.\nThe first eight placed teams at the 2017 IAAF World Relays and the host country qualify automatically for entry with remaining places being filled by teams with the fastest performances during the qualification period.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 12 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next two fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

        "text": "The women's heptathlon at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the Olympic Stadium on .\nSummary.\nWith the retirements of Jessica Ennis-Hill and Brianne Theisen-Eaton, Laura Ikauniece-Admidiņa was the only returning medalist from 2015. Since both retirees were also on the Olympic podium, that left Olympic champion Nafissatou Thiam as the clear favorite. She had scored the third best ever heptathlon score in Götzis at the end of May, her 7013 points getting close to the European Record. Ikauniece-Admidina and Carolin Schäfer had also both scored more than 6800 points with 6815 points and 6836 points respectably. Therefore three athletes had surpassed Thiam's winning score from Rio. \nNevertheless, Thiam's position was emphasized when Ikauniece-Admidiņa was injured in the first event and could not continue. Yorgelis Rodríguez provided surprise competition when she made three personal bests in the high jump to stay only 8 points behind Thiam. Both Rodríguez and Thiam tied at 1.95 metres which equaled the World Championship Heptathlon Best. Home favorite Katarina Johnson-Thompson was expected to be competitive, particularly in the high jump since she holds the British record, but she only made one clearance in the competition, at 1.80 metres, significantly below her personal best of 1.98 metres. Thiam separated from Rodríguez with a shot put 1.72 metres better. Carolin Schäfer was the next closest challenger after her personal best in the shot. Thiam's normally weak 200 metres was consistent, 24.57 is only 0.17 seconds off her personal best but it opened the door for Schäfer to be the overall leader after day one. Johnson-Thompson's 22.78 roared her back into contention in fourth place.\nAt the beginning of the second day, Johnson-Thompson produced a 6.56 metre long jump to move up in the rankings. Rodríguez and Schäfer lost some ground with 6.23 metre and 6.20 metre jumps. On her final attempt, Thiam gained ground on all of them with her 6.57 metre best jump of the day. In the javelin throw, Thiam and Schäfer were about even through the first two throws, with Rodríguez losing about two metres to both of them and Johnson-Thompson falling well behind. On the final throw, Schäfer edged a few centimetres past Thiam's earlier throw, but Thiam unleashed a 53.93 metre throw to pad her lead by another 76 points. But the best javelin throw of the day was a World Championship Heptathlon Best 58.41 metres by Anouk Vetter, which brought her into the medal chase, displacing Rodríguez. Going into the final event, Vetter and Schäfer were virtually tied with only 3 points separation. They knew their performance in the 800 metres would determine which medal they got. With 170 points to spare, it would take a weak 800 metres by Thiam to allow either a shot at gold. Schäfer's 800 metres record was about 3 seconds faster than Vetter coming in, and needing her best Schäfer managed at 2:15.34 while Vetter visibly struggled to a 2:19.43. While Thiam's 800 metres was the third from the bottom, it was still adequate for an easy overall win.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 6200 points.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was as follows:\nResults.\n100 metres hurdles.\nThe 100 metres hurdles took place on 5 August in four heats as follows:\nThe overall results were as follows:\nHigh jump.\nThe high jump took place on 5 August in two groups with Group A starting at 11:29 and Group B starting at 11:30.

        "title": "The Basketball League",
        "text": "The Basketball League (TBL), formerly North America Premier Basketball (NAPB), is a professional basketball organization. The league began operating in North America in 2018 with eight teams, and expanded to 38 teams .\nThe Basketball League is a professional basketball league providing player salaries from $500 to $6,500 per month, while teams operate on a budget of $125,000 to $250,000 per season.\nHistory.\nOn July 7, 2017, Sev Hrywnak and Dave Magley announced the formation of a new professional basketball league. Magley previously served as commissioner for the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC). Hrywnak was the owner of the Rochester Razorsharks. Teams are based throughout the United States and Western Canada. Over the course of two years, the league administration located cities that formerly hosted basketball teams in the defunct Continental Basketball Association, the Premier Basketball League, defunct NBA teams and other potential sports markets. The purpose of the league is to provide opportunities for community involvement particularly schools from the elementary to high school levels. Programs include players reading to younger children, hosting basketball camps for teens, and speaking in school-wide assemblies about substance abuse and staying in school.\nThe league launched its inaugural 2018 season with eight teams: the Albany Patroons, Kansas City Tornados, Kentucky Thoroughbreds, Nevada Desert Dogs, Ohio Cardinals, Rochester Razorsharks, Vancouver Knights, and the Yakima SunKings. The Ohio Cardinals were replaced mid-season by the Ohio Bootleggers, a team operated by the former ownership of the Vancouver Knights.\nOn February 25, 2018, Dave Magley announced that there were four more approved franchises in Bellevue, Washington; Raleigh, North Carolina; Tampa, Florida; and San Diego, California; with the goal of 16 total well-funded teams, for a 2019 season.\nAfter the first NAPB season, Magley acquired the league as sole owner, moved the headquarters to Indiana, and named Evelyn Magley—his wife—as the new CEO. On July 14, the league was re-branded as The Basketball League (TBL). Paul Mokeski, head coach and general manager of the Nevada Desert Dogs during the inaugural season, was then named commissioner of the league for the 2019 season. During the league changes, the Ohio Bootleggers, Rochester Razorsharks, and Vancouver Knights folded while the Bellevue team never came to fruition. The league then added the existing teams, the Jamestown Jackals and New York Court Kings, in addition to the three previously announced expansion teams, the Raleigh Firebirds, San Diego Waves, and Tampa Bay Titans. Three teams also slightly re-branded with the Kansas City Tornadoes, Mesquite Desert Dogs, and Owensboro Thoroughbreds. The 2019 season commenced with ten teams.\nDuring the second season, there were many canceled and rescheduled games. The league cut its season short, with the New York Court Kings and Kansas City Tornadoes either folding or ceasing operations for the season.\nPrior to the third season, the league added the Columbus Condors, Dayton Flight, Dallas Skyline, Gulf Coast Lions, Indy Express, Lewisville Yellow Jackets, and the Tri-State Admirals as expansion teams. The San Diego Waves were replaced by expansion San Diego Armada while the Waves were being relocated, but neither team would make the 2020 schedule. Due to the lack of other western teams, the Yakima SunKings and the Mesquite Desert Dogs suspended operations. The third season started in January 2020, but on March 11, 2020, the league announced the season would end prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic and have a four-team playoff on March 18 through 22. However, the tournament was also cancelled as most events throughout the country were closed to prevent the spread of the virus.\nThe league then proceeded to announce several new teams for the 2021 season, expanding from 12 teams in the curtailed 2020 season to 35 teams by January 11, 2021. Several of the added teams came from the semi-professional American Basketball Association. In March, several teams began opting out of the season due to the ongoing pandemic restrictions.\nFor the 2021–22 season, the National Basketball League of Canada (NBLC) announced that they had agreed to inter-league series play with several teams from The Basketball League. The games played between the teams from the two leagues are included in their respective regular season standings for each league.\nSeasons.\n\" Shortened season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Indy Express had the best overall record at the time of cancellation.\""

        "text": "Frank Alonzo Booker (born March 22, 1964) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for Bowling Green State University and was drafted by the New Jersey Nets in the 1987 NBA draft. He gained considerable fame in Iceland as a high scoring guard in the Úrvalsdeild karla during the early 1990s. He was a three-time scoring champion in the Úrvalsdeild and four time All-Star. In 1992, he led Valur to the Úrvalsdeild finals and in 1995 he won the Icelandic Basketball Cup with Grindavík.\nCollege.\nBooker played college basketball at Bowling Green State University from 1983 to 1987.\nCareer.\nNBA.\nOn June 22, 1987, Booker was selected by the New Jersey Nets with the second pick in round 7 of the 1987 NBA draft. He had short pre-season stints with the Nets, Miami Heat and Cleveland Cavaliers.\nIceland.\nÍR.\nBooker joined ÍR in January 1991, and in his first game he set a Úrvalsdeild record when he made 15 three-point shots. Two games later he tied the record when he again made 15 three-pointers, en route to 60 points, in a loss against Snæfell. For the season he averaged a league leading 43.2 points while making 7.8 three-pointers per game.\nValur.\nHe joined Valur at the start of the 1991–1992 season and led them to the 1992 Úrvalsdeild finals, where the team lost to Keflavík, 2–3, after holding a 2–1 lead in the series. As a member of Valur he led the league in scoring in 1992 and 1994. In 1994 he was named the All-Star game MVP.\nGrindavík.\nAfter three seasons with Valur, Booker joined Grindavík in 1994. For the season Booker averaged 15.5 points per game, leading the club to the second best record in the league, and helping it to win the 1995 Icelandic Basketball Cup.\nBooker was unexpectedly let go from Grindavík after their first game in the 1995 Úrvalsdeild playoffs. The split was far from amicable. Grindavík claimed Booker had become disgruntled and disinterested after being denied by the team to participate in the All-Star game in February, due to him missing practices the same week because of a back injury. They further claimed that he had dishonored an agreement to live in an apartment the club rented for him in Grindavík, dubbed \"the most expensive shoe storage this side of the Alps\" by the press, and spent to much energy driving back and forth from Reykjavík where he lived with his girlfriend. Booker responded that he was deeply disappointed by the dismissal and the allegations but wished the club all the best in its upcoming games.\nGrindavík stepped up after Booker's departure, dismantling Haukar in the next game, 88–122, and sweeping them out of the playoffs.\nAfter a big loss to Keflavík in the semi-finals, allegations rose that Booker had leaked Grindavík's playbook to Keflavík. Both Booker and Keflavík's head coach, Jón Kr. Gíslason, strongly denied the allegations, with Jón Kr. stating that he had multiple game tapes of Keflavík and did not need any help in finding their tactics. To further fuel the argument between the two parties, Booker requested that the club paid him bonus for it getting to the quarter finals as was stated in his contract.\nCoaching career.\nBooker started as the head coach of Valur during the 1993–1994 season. He was replaced after a 3–10 start by Svali Björgvinsson.\nPersonal life.\nBooker's half Icelandic son, Frank Aron Booker, played for the Oklahoma Sooners in the Big 12 Conference from 2013 to 2015. He transferred from the Florida Atlantic Owls before the 2015–16 season. Prior to his senior year, Frank Aron transferred to South Carolina for the 2017–18 season."

In the same article Mayor Clarke raised the question of the Australian Federal Government's commitment to a 2018 Commonwealth Games Bid in light of the Government's support for Australia's 2018 FIFA World Cup Finals bid.\nOn 16 April 2009, Queensland Premier Anna Bligh told reporters that a successful Commonwealth Games bid by the Gold Coast could help the tourist strip win a role in hosting the World Cup. \"Some of the infrastructure that would be built for the Commonwealth Games will be useful for the Gold Coast to get a World Cup game out of the soccer World Cup if we're successful as a nation,\" she said. However the decision on the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups will come 11 months prior to the bid decision for the 2018 Commonwealth Games, so the potential World Cup venues will already have been chosen.\nOn 3 June 2009, the Gold Coast was confirmed as Australia's exclusive bidder vying for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. \"Should a bid proceed, the Gold Coast will have the exclusive Australian rights to bid as host city for 2018,\" Premier Anna Bligh stated. \"Recently I met with the president and CEO of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association and we agreed to commission a full and comprehensive feasibility study into the potential for the 2018 Commonwealth Games,\" she said. \"Under the stewardship of Queensland Events new chair, Mr Geoff Dixon, that study is now well advanced.\"\nOn 15 March 2010, it was announced that the Queensland Government will provide initial funding of A$11 million for the 2018 Commonwealth Games bid. The Premier of Queensland has indicated the Government's support for the bid to the Australian Commonwealth Games Association.\nOn 31 March 2010, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association officially launched the bid to host the 2018 Commonwealth Games. In October 2011, Gold Coast Mayor Ron Clarke stated that the games would provide a strong legacy for the city after the games have ended.\nSee also.\nCommonwealth Games celebrated in Australia"

He is also the first boxer in history to win the lineal championship in five different weight divisions, as well as being the first boxer in history to win major world titles in four of the original eight weight divisions of boxing, also known as the \"glamour divisions\": flyweight, featherweight, lightweight and welterweight.\nIn July 2019, Pacquiao became the oldest welterweight world champion in history at the age of 40, and the first boxer to become a recognized four-time welterweight champion after defeating Keith Thurman to win the WBA (Super) welterweight title. Pacquiao also holds the record of being the only boxer to hold world titles in four different decades, in the 1990s, 2000s, 2010s, and 2020s.\nHe was named Fighter of the Decade for the 2000s by the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA), WBC, WBO and HBO. He is also a three-time \"Ring\" magazine, ESPN and BWAA Fighter of the Year, winning both awards in 2006, 2008 and 2009; and the Best Fighter ESPY Award in 2009 and 2011. In 2016, Pacquiao was ranked second on ESPN's list of top boxers, pound-for-pound, of the past 25 years. BoxRec ranks Pacquiao as the fourth greatest boxer, pound for pound, of all time, as well as the greatest Asian boxer of all time. Boxing historian Bert Sugar ranked Pacquiao as the greatest southpaw fighter of all time. Spanish media outlet \"Marca\" placed Pacquiao 16th on their Greatest Sportsmen of the 21st Century list. In 2021, Pacquiao held the top spot in DAZN's list of the top 10 boxers of the previous 30 years and as of 2022, he was ranked ninth in \"The Ring\"s list of the top 100 boxers of all time.\nPacquiao was long rated as the best active boxer in the world, pound-for-pound, by most sporting news and boxing websites, including ESPN, \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Sporting Life\", Yahoo! Sports, About.com, BoxRec and \"The Ring\", beginning from his climb to lightweight until his losses at welterweight in 2012. He was also the longest reigning top-ten active boxer on \"The Ring\"'s pound-for-pound list.\nPacquiao has generated approximately 20.4 million total pay-per-view (PPV) buys and $1.29 billion in revenue from his 26 PPV bouts. According to \"Forbes\", he was the second highest paid athlete in the world in 2015.\nAmateur career.\nAt the age of 14, Pacquiao moved to Manila and lived for a time on the streets. He started boxing while working as construction worker and enduring hunger just to send money to his mother and made the Philippine national amateur boxing team where his room and board were paid for by the government. Pacquiao reportedly had an amateur record of 60 wins and 4 losses.\nProfessional career.\nLight flyweight.\nIn 1995, the death of a young aspiring boxer and close friend, Eugene Barutag, spurred the young Pacquiao to pursue a professional boxing career. Pacquiao started his professional boxing career when he was just 16 years old, stood at 4'11\" and weighed 98 pounds (7 pounds under the mini-flyweight division). He admitted before American media that he put weights in his pockets to make the 105-pound weight limit. His early light flyweight division fights took place in small local venues and were shown on Vintage Sports' \"Blow by Blow\", an evening boxing show. His professional debut was a four-round bout against Edmund \"Enting\" Ignacio, on January 22, 1995. Weighing just 106 pounds, Pacquiao won via unanimous decision, becoming an instant star of the program. Pacquiao's name was so accustomed to the viewers not only because of his aggressive, go-for-broke kamikaze-style of fighting, but also of his unique looks and catchy surname.\nFlyweight.\nPacquiao's weight increased from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his twelfth bout against Rustico Torrecampo via third-round knockout. He was caught with a looping left hand flush on the chin which he couldn't get up from. Pacquiao failed to make the required weight, so he was forced to use heavier gloves than Torrecampo, thereby putting him at a disadvantage.\nFollowing the Torrecampo fight, Pacquiao continued undefeated for his next fifteen fights. He went on another unbeaten run that saw him take on the more experienced Chokchai Chockvivat in the flyweight division. Pacquiao knocked out Chockvivat in the fifth round and took the OPBF flyweight title. After one official defense and two non-title bouts, Pacquiao got his first opportunity to fight for a world title.\nPacquiao vs. Sasakul.\nPacquiao captured the WBC and lineal flyweight titles (his first major boxing world title) over Chatchai Sasakul by way of knockout in the eighth round. He defended the titles successfully against Mexican Gabriel Mira via a fourth-round technical knockout. However, Pacquiao lost the lineal title in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat, also known as Medgoen 3K Battery, via third-round knockout. The bout was held in Nakhon Si Thammarat, Thailand. Singsurat got Pacquiao on the ropes and landed a flush straight right to the body, coiling Pacquiao over and keeping him there. Prior to the fight, Pacquiao lost the WBC title at the scales as he surpassed the weight limit of 112 pounds.\nSuper bantamweight.\nFollowing his loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao gained weight and skipped the super flyweight and bantamweight divisions. This time, Pacquiao went to super bantamweight division of 122 pounds, where he picked up the WBC International super bantamweight title. He defended this title five times before his chance for a world title fight came.\nPacquiao vs. Ledwaba.\nPacquiao's big break came on June 23, 2001, against IBF super bantamweight title holder Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement on two weeks' notice but won the fight by technical knockout to win the title, his second major boxing world title. The bout was held at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in Paradise, Nevada. Pacquiao went on to defend this title four times under head trainer Freddie Roach, owner of the Wild Card Gym in West Hollywood.\nPacquiao vs. Sanchez.\nPacquiao faced Agapito Sánchez in a unification match on November 10, 2001, at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco, California as the main supporting bout of Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Jesús Chávez. This marks both Mayweather and Pacquiao first appearance together in the same fight card. The bout ended in the sixth round under the recommendation of the ringside physician to stop the fight as Pacquiao was unfit to continue due to the cuts inflicted by Sanchez's repeated headbutts. The bout was ruled a split draw.\nPacquiao vs. Julio.\nPacquiao knocked out Jorge Eliecer Julio in the second round on June 8, 2002, at The Pyramid in Memphis, Tennessee as the main supporting bout of Lennox Lewis vs. Mike Tyson fight. This marks Pacquiao's first appearance in a joint HBO and Showtime fight card.\nFeatherweight.\nPacquiao vs. Barrera I.\nOn November 15, 2003, Pacquiao faced Marco Antonio Barrera at the Alamodome, San Antonio, Texas, in a fight that many consider to have defined his career. In spite of Barrera being given credit for knocking Pacquiao down in the first round (as replays showed the punch missed), Pacquiao, who was fighting at featherweight for the first time, brought his power with him and defeated Barrera via technical knockout in the eleventh round. This was the only loss in Barrera's professional career to have come officially via stoppage inside the distance. With the victory, Pacquiao won \"The Ring\" and lineal featherweight championships, making him the first Filipino and Asian to become a three-division world champion, a fighter who won world titles in three different weight divisions. He defended the title twice before relinquishing it in 2005.\nOn November 24, 2003, the then Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo conferred on Pacquiao the Presidential Medal of Merit at the Ceremonial Hall of Malacañang Palace for his knockout victory over the best featherweight boxer in the world. The following day, the members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines presented the House Resolution No. 765, authored by the then House Speaker Jose De Venecia and Bukidnon Representative Juan Miguel Zubiri, which honored Pacquiao the Congressional Medal of Achievement for his exceptional achievements. Pacquiao is the first sportsman to receive such an honor from the House of Representatives.\nPacquiao vs. Márquez I.\nSix months after the fight with Barrera, Pacquiao challenged Juan Manuel Márquez, who at the time held both the WBA and IBF featherweight titles. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas, on May 8, 2004.\nIn the first round, Márquez was caught cold, as he was knocked down three times by Pacquiao. However, Márquez showed great heart to recover from the early knockdowns and went on to win the majority of rounds thereafter. This was largely due to Márquez's counterpunch style, which he managed to effectively use against the aggressive style of Pacquiao. At the end of a very close fight, both boxers felt they had done enough to win the fight. The bout was scored a draw, which proved to be a controversial decision. The final scores were 115–110 for Márquez, 115–110 for Pacquiao, and 113–113. The judge who scored the bout 113–113 admitted to making an error on the scorecards, having scored the first round as 10–7 in favor of Pacquiao instead of the standard 10–6 for a three-knockdown round. If he had scored the round 10–6 for Pacquiao (as the other two judges did), the result would have been a split decision in favor of Pacquiao. However, ESPN reported that some pundits have also scored the fight in favor of Márquez.\nSuper featherweight.\nPacquiao vs. Morales I.\nOn March 19, 2005, Pacquiao moved up to the super featherweight division of 130 pounds to fight another Mexican legend and three-division world champion Érik Morales, for the vacant WBC International and vacant IBA super featherweight titles. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, Las Vegas. In this fight, Pacquiao sustained a cut over his right eye from an accidental clash of heads in the fifth round. He lost the twelve-round match by a unanimous decision from the judges. All three scorecards read 115–113 for Morales.\nOn September 10, 2005, Pacquiao knocked Héctor Velázquez out in six rounds at Staples Center in Los Angeles to capture the WBC International super featherweight title, which he went on to defend five times. On the same card, his rival Morales fought Zahir Raheem and lost via unanimous decision in the main event.\nPacquiao vs. Morales II.\nDespite Morales's loss to Raheem, Pacquiao got matched up against him in a rematch which took place on January 21, 2006, at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas. During the fight, Morales escaped being knocked down twice, once in the second round by holding onto the ropes and once in the sixth by falling on the referee. Pacquiao eventually stopped Morales in the tenth with a TKO, the first time Morales was stopped in his boxing career.\nPacquiao vs. Larios.\nOn July 2, 2006, Pacquiao defended his WBC International title against Óscar Larios, a two-time super bantamweight champion who had moved up two weight divisions to fight Pacquiao. Pacquiao won the fight via unanimous decision, knocking down Larios two times in the twelve-round bout at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines. The three judges respectively scored the fight 117–110, 118–108, and 120–106.\nOn July 3, 2006, the day after winning the fight against Larios, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo personally bestowed the Order of Lakandula with the rank of \"Champion for Life\" (\"Kampeon Habambuhay\") and the plaque of appreciation upon Pacquiao in a simple ceremony at the Presidential Study of Malacañang Palace.\nPacquiao vs. Morales III.\nPacquiao and Morales fought a third time (with the series tied 1–1) on November 18, 2006. Witnessed by a near-record crowd of 18,276, the match saw Pacquiao defeat Morales via a third-round knockout at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas. After the Pacquiao–Morales rubber match, Bob Arum, Pacquiao's main promoter, announced that Manny had returned his signing bonus back to Golden Boy Promotions, signaling intentions to stay with Top Rank. This prompted Golden Boy Promotions to sue Pacquiao over breach of contract.\nPacquiao vs. Solís.\nAfter a failed promotional negotiation with Marco Antonio Barrera's camp, Bob Arum chose Jorge Solís as Pacquiao's next opponent among several fighters Arum offered as replacements. The bout was held in San Antonio, Texas, on April 14, 2007. In the sixth round, an accidental headbutt occurred, giving Pacquiao a cut under his left eyebrow. The fight ended in the eighth when Pacquiao knocked Solís down twice. Solís barely beat the count after the second knockdown, causing the referee to stop the fight and award Pacquiao a knockout win. The victory raised Pacquiao's win–loss–draw record to 44–3–2 with 34 knockouts. This also marked the end of Solís's undefeated streak.\nPacquiao vs. Barrera II.\nOn June 29, 2007, Top Rank and Golden Boy Promotions announced that they agreed to settle their lawsuit, meaning the long-awaited rematch with Marco Antonio Barrera would occur despite Pacquiao being the top-ranked contender for Juan Manuel Márquez's WBC super featherweight title. On October 6, 2007, Pacquiao defeated Barrera in their rematch via an easy unanimous decision. In the eleventh round, Pacquiao's punch caused a deep cut below Barrera's right eye. Barrera retaliated with an illegal punch on the break that dazed Pacquiao, but also resulted in a point deduction for Barrera. Two judges scored the bout 118–109, whereas the third scored it 115–112.\nIn \"The Ring\" magazine, Pacquiao (45–3–2) remained at the top of the super featherweight division (130 pounds). He had been in the ratings for 108 weeks. On November 13, 2007, he was honored by the World Boxing Council as \"Emeritus Champion\" during its 45th Annual World Convention held at the Manila Hotel.\nOn November 20, 2007, José Nuñez, manager of WBO super featherweight champion Joan Guzmán, accused Pacquiao's handler Bob Arum of evading a match between the two boxers to protect Pacquiao. Guzmán went as far as to directly call out Pacquiao at the post-fight press conference of the Pacquiao–Barrera rematch in front of the crowd at the Mandalay Bay Events Center's media room in Las Vegas.\nPacquiao vs. Márquez II.\nOn March 15, 2008, in a rematch against Juan Manuel Márquez, called \"Unfinished Business,\" Pacquiao won via split decision. The fight was held at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. With the victory, Pacquiao won the WBC, \"The Ring\" and lineal super featherweight titles, making him the first Filipino and Asian to become a four-division world champion, a fighter who won world titles in four different weight divisions. The fight was a close, hard-fought battle, during which both fighters received cuts. Throughout the fight, Márquez landed the most punches at a higher percentage; however, the decisive factor proved to be a third-round knockdown, wherein Márquez was floored by a Pacquiao left hook. At the end of the fight, the judges' scores were 115–112 for Pacquiao, 115–112 for Márquez, and 114–113 for Pacquiao.\nIn the post-fight news conference, Márquez's camp called for an immediate rematch. In addition, Richard Schaefer, Golden Boy Promotions CEO, offered a $6 million guarantee to Pacquiao for a rematch. However, Pacquiao ruled out a third clash with Márquez, saying, \"I don't think so. This business is over.\" The reason that Pacquiao did not want a rematch was because he intended to move up to the lightweight division to challenge David Díaz, the reigning WBC lightweight title holder at that time. Díaz won a majority decision over Ramón Montano that night as an undercard of the \"Unfinished Business\" fight.\nLightweight.\nPacquiao vs. Díaz.\nOn June 28, 2008, at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, Pacquiao moved to the lightweight division and claimed the WBC lightweight title, defeating David Díaz via knockout in round nine. With the victory, Pacquiao became the first and only Filipino and Asian to become a five-division world champion, a fighter who won world titles in five different weight divisions. He also became the first Filipino fighter to ever win a world title at lightweight. During the fight, which Pacquiao dominated, Díaz was cut badly on his right eye in the fourth round. After the bout, Díaz acknowledged Pacquiao's superior hand speed, stating \"It was his speed. It was all his speed. I could see the punches perfectly, but he was just too fast.\"\nBob Arum reported that the fight had made $12.5 million, earning Díaz his best payday of $850,000, whilst Pacquiao earned at least $3 million. Official records revealed an attendance of 8,362 (out of a maximum capacity of 12,000).\nHolding both the WBC super featherweight and lightweight titles following the win, Pacquiao decided to vacate his super featherweight title in July 2008.\nOn August 7, 2008, the members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines issued a House Resolution, sponsored by South Cotabato Congresswoman Darlene Antonino-Custodio, which recognized Pacquiao as a \"People's Champ\" — \"for his achievements and in appreciation of the honor and inspiration he has been bringing... to the Filipino people.\" He received a plaque from the then House Speaker Prospero Nograles.\nWelterweight.\nPacquiao vs. De La Hoya.\nOn December 6, 2008, Pacquiao moved up to the welterweight division to face the six-division world champion Oscar De La Hoya at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in a fight called \"The Dream Match\". Presented by Golden Boy Promotions and Top Rank, the bout was scheduled as a twelve-round, non-title fight contested at the 147-pound welterweight limit. Although Pacquiao went into the fight widely recognized as the leading pound-for-pound boxer in the world, some boxing pundits had speculated that 147 pounds could be too far above his natural weight against the larger De La Hoya. However, due to rehydration after the weigh in, De La Hoya came into the fight actually weighing less than Pacquiao and close to 20 pounds under his usual fighting weight. Pacquiao dominated the fight and, after eight rounds, De La Hoya's corner was forced to throw in the towel, awarding Pacquiao the win via technical knockout.\nPacquiao was ahead on all three judges' scorecards before the stoppage, with two judges scoring the fight at 80–71 and one scoring it at 79–72. Moreover, Pacquiao landed 224 out of 585 punches, whilst De La Hoya landed only 83 out of 402 punches. After the bout, trainer Freddie Roach stated, \"We knew we had him after the first round. He had no legs, he was hesitant and he was shot.\" The fight would be De La Hoya's last, as he announced his retirement from boxing shortly after.\nPacquiao received 15 to $30 million (share of the pay-per-view), plus a guaranteed amount. Tickets reportedly sold out just hours after they went on sale. Moreover, the total gate revenue for the fight was said to be nearly $17 million, making it the second largest gate revenue in boxing history.\nOn December 22, 2008, Pacquiao was decorated with the Philippine Legion of Honor with the rank of \"Officer\" (\"Pinuno\") in a ceremony marking the 73rd founding anniversary of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. As an army reservist, he was given recognition for bringing pride and honor to the country through his remarkable achievements in the ring.\nLight welterweight.\nPacquiao vs. Hatton.\nOn May 2, 2009, Pacquiao fought at light welterweight for the first time against Ricky Hatton at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in a fight billed as \"The Battle of the East and West.\" Pacquiao won the bout via knockout to claim Hatton's IBO, \"The Ring\" and lineal light welterweight titles. In doing so, Pacquiao became the second man in boxing history to become a six-division world champion, a fighter who won world titles in six different weight divisions and the first man ever to win lineal world titles in four different weight classes.\nThe fight was originally placed in jeopardy due to disputes with both camps over the fight purse money. Eventually, the money issue was settled and the fight went on as scheduled. HBO aired the contest.\nPacquiao started the fight strong, knocking down Hatton twice in the first round. A somewhat shaken Hatton beat the count, only to be saved by the bell seconds later. In the second round, Hatton seemed to have recovered, as he stalked Pacquiao for most of the round. However, with less than ten seconds remaining in the round, Hatton was knocked out cold by a sharp left hook, prompting the referee to award Pacquiao the win by knockout at 2:59.\nThe knockout won him \"The Ring\" magazine \"Knockout of the Year\" for 2009.\nReturn to welterweight.\nPacquiao vs. Cotto.\nOn November 14, 2009, Pacquiao defeated Miguel Cotto via technical knockout in the twelfth round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena, in a fight billed as \"Firepower.\" Although the bout was sanctioned as a world title fight in the welterweight division, where the weight limit is 147 pounds, Cotto agreed to fight at a catchweight of 145 pounds.\nPacquiao dominated the fight, knocking Cotto down in round three and round four, before the referee stopped the fight at 0:55 of round twelve. With this victory, Pacquiao took the WBO welterweight title, was awarded the WBO super championship title and became the first seven-division world champion, the first fighter in boxing history to win world titles in seven different weight divisions, as well as the first boxer in history to win major world titles in four of the eight \"glamour divisions\" of boxing (flyweight, featherweight, lightweight and welterweight). Pacquiao also won the first and special WBC diamond championship belt. This belt was created as an honorary championship exclusively to award the winner of a historic fight between two high-profile boxers. After the fight, promoter Bob Arum stated \"Pacquiao is the greatest boxer I've ever seen, and I've seen them all, including Ali, Hagler and Sugar Ray Leonard.\" Cotto said in a post-fight interview: \"Miguel Cotto comes to boxing to fight the biggest names, and Manny is one of the best boxers we have of all time.\"\nThe fight generated 1.25 million buys and $70 million in domestic pay-per-view revenue, making it the most watched boxing event of 2009. Pacquiao earned around $22 million for his part in the fight, whilst Cotto earned around $12 million. Pacquiao–Cotto also generated a live gate of $8,847,550 from an official crowd of 15,930.\nOn November 20, 2009, in a simple rites at the Quirino Grandstand, President Macapagal-Arroyo conferred Pacquiao the Order of Sikatuna with the rank of \"Datu\" (Grand Cross) with Gold distinction (\"Katangiang Ginto\") which usually bestowed upon foreign diplomats and heads of state. It was awarded to Pacquiao for winning his historical seventh weight division world title.\nNegotiations with Floyd Mayweather Jr..\nFollowing the victory against Cotto, there was much public demand for a fight between Pacquiao (the number-one pound-for-pound boxer) and the five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. (the number-two and former number-one pound-for-pound boxer). Pacquiao reportedly agreed to fight Mayweather on March 13, 2010, for a split of $50 million up front and it was later agreed that the venue for the fight would be the MGM Grand Garden Arena. However, the bout was put in jeopardy due to disagreements about Olympic-style drug testing. The Mayweather camp wanted random blood testing by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), whereas Pacquiao refused to have any blood testing within 30 days from the fight, because he thought it would weaken him, but he was willing to have blood taken from him before the 30-day window as well as immediately after the fight. Freddie Roach, on the other hand, commented that he would not allow blood to be taken from Pacquiao one week before the fight. In an attempt to resolve their differences, the two camps went through a process of mediation before a retired judge. After the mediation process Mayweather agreed to a 14-day no blood testing window. However, Pacquiao refused and instead only agreed to a 24-day no blood testing window. Consequently, on January 6, 2010, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum declared that the fight was officially off.\nBecause of Pacquiao's reluctance to submit to random blood testing to the extent requested by Mayweather, despite lack of evidence, the Mayweather camp repeated their suggestion that Pacquiao was using banned substances, which resulted in Pacquiao filing a lawsuit for defamation, seeking damages in excess of $75,000. The lawsuit cited accusations made by Floyd Mayweather Jr., Floyd Mayweather Sr., Roger Mayweather, Oscar De La Hoya and Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer.\nAfter negotiations for the Mayweather fight fell through, other boxers were considered to replace Mayweather as Pacquiao's next opponent, including former light welterweight champion Paulie Malignaggi and WBA super welterweight title holder Yuri Foreman. However, Pacquiao chose to fight former IBF welterweight title holder Joshua Clottey instead.\nPacquiao vs. Clottey.\nOn March 13, 2010, at the Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas, Pacquiao defeated Clottey via unanimous decision to retain his WBO welterweight title. The judges scored the fight 120–108, 119–109, and 119–109, all in favor of Pacquiao. During the fight, Pacquiao threw a total of 1231 punches (a career high), but landed just 246, as most were blocked by Clottey's tight defense. On the other hand, Clottey threw a total of 399 punches, landing 108.\nThe fight was rewarded with a paid crowd of 36,371 and a gate of $6,359,985, according to post-fight tax reports filed with Texas boxing regulators. Counting complimentary tickets delivered to sponsors, media outlets and others, the Dallas fight attracted 41,843, well short of the 50,994 that was previously announced, but still an epic number for boxing. In addition, the bout drew 700,000 pay-per-view buys and earned $35.3 million in domestic revenue.\nPacquiao was named as the Fighter of the Decade for years 2000–2009 by the Boxing Writers Association of America (BWAA). This award was presented by legendary boxer Joe Frazier, who was also a recipient of the award himself back in 1978 for defeating Muhammad Ali. Aside from this prestigious recognition, he was also named as the Sugar Ray Robinson Fighter of the Year for 2009, having received the same honor in 2006 and 2008. The awards ceremony was held at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City on June 4, 2010.\nAfter his victory over Clottey, Pacquiao was expected to return to boxing in late 2010 with a possible matchup against Floyd Mayweather Jr.. It was later reported that Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer and Top Rank Chief Bob Arum worked out a \"super fight\" between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather Jr.. However, complications arose when Mayweather requested Pacquiao undergo random blood and urine testing up until the fight day. Pacquiao responded that he would agree to undergo blood and urine testing up until 14 days before the fight (as requested by Mayweather in the first round of negotiations), stating that giving blood too close to the fight day would weaken him. On May 13, 2010, Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum announced that he had penciled on November 13, 2010, as the date of Manny Pacquiao's next fight, possibly against Mayweather. However, the stumbling block over demands that Pacquiao submit to Olympic-level random drug testing put the fight in jeopardy.\nOn June 12, 2010, the President of Golden Boy Promotions, Oscar De La Hoya, stated during an interview with Univision that the deal for the fight was very close and the negotiation process has been very difficult. On June 30, 2010, Arum announced that the management of both sides had agreed to terms, that all points had been settled (including Pacquiao agreeing to submit to both blood and urine testing) and only the signature of Floyd Mayweather Jr. was needed to seal the deal that could have earned both fighters at least $40 million each. Mayweather was then given a two-week deadline for the fight contract to be signed. Arum also announced that Pacquiao accepted the terms of the random drug testing, blood and urine, leading up to the fight.\nOn July 15, 2010, Bob Arum announced that Pacquiao's camp would give Mayweather until Friday midnight to sign the fight. The next day, the Top Rank website embedded a countdown clock on their website with the heading \"Money\" Time: Mayweather's Decision. On July 17, 2010, Arum announced that there was no word from Mayweather's camp and the deal for a November 13, 2010, fight with Mayweather was not reached.\nOn July 19, 2010, Leonard Ellerbe, one of Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s closest advisers, denied that negotiations for a super fight between Mayweather and Pacquiao had ever taken place. Ellerbe stated that Bob Arum was not telling the truth. Bob Arum responded, questioning that if there was no negotiation, then who imposed the gag order (referring to a gag order about the negotiation allegedly imposed on both camps) and who could there be a gag order from if there were no negotiations. He also criticized Oscar De La Hoya and his Golden Boy Promotions CEO Richard Schaefer for denying that negotiations took place, when De La Hoya himself had previously stated that they were \"very, very close in finalizing the contracts.\" Arum revealed that HBO Sports President Ross Greenburg acted as the mediator between Mayweather's handlers and those of Pacquiao's from Top Rank Promotions.\nOn July 26, 2010, Ross Greenburg said that he has been negotiating with a representative from each side since May 2, 2010, carefully trying to put the fight together and he did in fact act as a go-between in negotiations with the two sides, but they were unable to come to an agreement, contradicting what Arum and the Pacquiao camp had said. Floyd Mayweather Jr., after the second negotiation had been officially declared off, told the Associated Press that he had fought sixty days ago and that he was not interested in rushing into anything and was not really thinking about boxing at the moment.\nLight middleweight.\nPacquiao vs. Margarito.\nOn July 23, 2010, Bob Arum announced that Pacquiao would fight Antonio Margarito on November 13, 2010. The fight for the vacant WBC super welterweight title gave Pacquiao the chance to win a world title in his eighth weight class, the super welterweight division. A catchweight of 150 pounds was established for the fight, although the weight limit for the super welterweight division is 154 pounds. During the pre-fight, Pacquiao weighed in at a low 144.6 pounds, while Margarito weighed in at the limit of 150 pounds. Pacquiao said he was pleased with his weight because he loses too much speed when he gains pounds. During the fight itself, Pacquiao weighed 148 lb, 17 pounds lighter than Margarito's 165.\nPrior to the fight, Pacquiao's team demanded to the Texas officials to test Margarito for banned substances after a weight loss supplement, reportedly Hydroxycut, was found in his locker. It was stated that the officials would undergo testing for both boxers after the fight. In the fight, Pacquiao defeated Margarito via unanimous decision, using his superior handspeed and movement to win his eighth world title in as many divisions. In the penultimate round, Pacquiao implored referee Laurence Cole several times to stop the fight as Margarito had a swollen face and a large cut beneath the right eye, but the referee let the fight continue. Margarito had to be taken directly to the hospital after the fight, where it was discovered his orbital bone had been fractured; he had to undergo surgery.\nOn November 22, 2010, after winning world title in his eighth weight division, Pacquiao was awarded with another Congressional Medal of Distinction during the ceremony at the Philippine House of Representatives.\nBecause Pacquiao had no plans to defend the WBC super welterweight title that he won against Margarito, the WBC Board of Governors voted to declare the title vacant.\nSecond return to welterweight.\nPacquiao vs. Mosley.\nOn May 7, 2011, Pacquiao successfully defended his WBO welterweight title against three-division world champion Shane Mosley via lopsided unanimous decision at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Rapper LL Cool J performed as Mosley first entered the arena, while vocalist Jimi Jamison of the rock band Survivor sang \"Eye of the Tiger\" as Pacquiao approached the ring. Pacquiao knocked Mosley down in the third round using a one-two capped with a left straight. Mosley was left dazed by the knockdown but managed to stand up. Mosley floored Pacquiao in the tenth round with a push, but referee Kenny Bayless inexplicably ruled it a knockdown. None of the judges seemed to have bought it judging from the scores. Replays showed that Pacquiao was throwing a punch off balance, had his right foot stepped on by Mosley's left foot and went down with a little help from Mosley's right hand. Bayless apologized to Pacquiao after the fight for the mistake. Pacquiao gained one-sided verdicts from all three judges 119–108, 120–108, and 120–107. Pacquiao reported that the only thing preventing him from knocking out Mosley was a cramp in his legs. Freddie Roach said that Pacquiao had problems with cramping before but usually in training sessions and not in the middle of bouts. After the fight, there was much controversy over Mosley reportedly telling Floyd Mayweather Jr. that he should have made Pacquiao \"take the test.\"\nBob Arum talked about having Pacquiao's next bout at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on November 5, 2011, or across town at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center on November 12, 2011. Arum listed Juan Manuel Márquez as the first choice and then mentioned Timothy Bradley and Zab Judah as other options.\nPacquiao vs. Márquez III.\nPacquiao's promoter Bob Arum stated that a third meeting with Márquez could happen in November 2011, providing Pacquiao defeated his next opponent Shane Mosley on May 7. On May 10, Márquez accepted an offer from Top Rank to fight Pacquiao for his WBO welterweight title at a catchweight of 144 pounds. On May 18, Márquez signed the deal to fight Pacquiao for the third time on November 12 in Las Vegas.\nOn November 12, Pacquiao defeated Márquez via majority decision 114–114, 115–113, and 116–112. Upon the results being announced, the crowd reaction was largely negative with thousands continuing to boo as Pacquiao spoke with Max Kellerman. Tim Smith of New York's \"Daily News\" wrote that Márquez \"was robbed of a decision by judges who were either blind or corrupt.\" However, ringside punch stats showed Pacquiao landing more strikes, 176 to 138, and landing more power punches, 117 to 100. Michael Woods of ESPN stated that Márquez was not robbed noting the CompuBox stats, all of which favored Pacquiao.\nPacquiao vs. Bradley.\nOn February 5, Bob Arum announced Timothy Bradley as Pacquiao's next opponent on June 9 for his WBO welterweight title, after another failed negotiation attempt with Floyd Mayweather Jr. on Cinco de Mayo. During the final press conference, WBO President Francisco \"Paco\" Valcarcel awarded Pacquiao with WBO Diamond Ring in recognition of Pacquiao as the WBO Best Pound-for-Pound Fighter of the Decade.\nPacquiao lost the bout in a controversial split decision, scoring 115–113, 113–115, and 113–115 from the three judges. The decision was booed by the crowd and criticized by many news outlets who were independently scoring the fight. However, Pacquiao was gracious in defeat and Bradley called for a rematch. Following the decision, many analysts called the decision a sign of corruption in the sport. ESPN.com scored the fight 119–109 for Pacquiao. HBO's unofficial judge, Harold Lederman, also had it 119–109 for Pacquiao. Most ringside media also scored the fight in favor of Pacquiao.\nFour days after the fight, Valcarcel said on June 13, 2012, that, though the WBO did not doubt the ability of the scoring judges, the WBO's Championship Committee would review the video of the fight with five independent, competent and recognized international judges and make a recommendation. On June 21, 2012, the five WBO Championship Committee judges on the review panel announced that Pacquiao should have won, with all five judges scoring the fight in Pacquiao's favor 117–111, 117–111, 118–110, 116–112, and 115–113. The WBO cannot overturn the result of the fight (only the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) would be able to do so), but recommended a rematch between the fighters.\nPacquiao vs. Márquez IV.\nPacquiao fought Juan Manuel Márquez on December 8, 2012. The fight was for the WBO's \"Champion of the Decade\" belt. Márquez knocked down Pacquiao in the third round with a looping right hook. In round five, Pacquiao returned the favor, knocking down Márquez. Pacquiao went on the offensive in the sixth round. While behind the scorecards and with just one second left in the sixth round, Márquez countered Pacquiao's jab with an overhand right, sending Pacquiao face first to the canvas, resulting in a knockout. Pacquiao, who had not been knocked out in over 13 years since his loss to Medgoen Singsurat in 1999, remained unconscious for several minutes. This was named \"The Ring\" magazine's \"Fight of the Year\" and \"Knockout of the Year\" and \"International Fight of the Year\" by the British website BoxRec. Márquez was also named \"International Fighter of the Year\" by the same publication.\nPacquiao vs. Ríos.\nAfter 11 months away from boxing, Pacquiao returned to the ring on November 24, 2013, at The Venetian Macao Hotel &amp; Resort's Cotai Arena in Macau of the Special administrative regions in China against \"The Ring\" ranked No. 6 light welterweight: Brandon Ríos, for the vacant WBO International welterweight title. This was Pacquiao's first fight to be held in China. Pacquiao won the match by unanimous decision.\nPacquiao vs. Bradley II.\nFollowing his victory over Rios, Pacquiao sought out and ultimately got a rematch with the WBO welterweight champion of the world: Timothy Bradley who, following his controversial win over Pacquiao in their first fight in 2012, had defended the title with a victory over Ruslan Provodnikov, followed by a close, but clear split decision verdict over Juan Manuel Márquez. The fight was eventually set for the date of April 12, 2014, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada. In a tough fight, Pacquiao came on the stronger of the two fighters throughout the later rounds of the fight to end up gaining a unanimous decision victory from the judges 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112.\nPacquiao vs. Algieri.\nPacquiao faced undefeated WBO light welterweight champion Chris Algieri in Macau on November 23, 2014, for Pacquiao's welterweight title. Pacquiao dominated the bout and scored six official knockdowns en route to a lopsided victory via unanimous decision 119–103, 119–103, and 120–102.\nPacquiao vs. Mayweather.\nPacquiao fought Floyd Mayweather Jr. in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on May 2, 2015. After years of tumultuous negotiations, the two finally met in the ring, Pacquiao with the intent to be the aggressor and Mayweather with the strategy of diffuse and counter. The fight went the distance and to the official judges' scorecards which read 118–110, 116–112, and 116–112 in favor of Mayweather.\n17 of the 19 reporters ringside for the bout scored in favour of Mayweather.\nPacquiao said \"I had a torn shoulder\" as well as \"I thought I won the fight. He's moving around. It's not easy to throw punches when he's moving around so much. It's not about size. Size doesn't matter. I fought bigger. I thought I caught him many more times than he caught me.\"\nIn the end, the Mayweather vs. Pacquiao match earned a record 4.4 million pay-per-view buys.\nTemporary retirement.\nPacquiao vs. Bradley III.\nTop Rank promoter Bob Arum said Pacquiao's next opponents were to be either Terence Crawford, Lucas Matthysse or Kell Brook. There was also speculation that Amir Khan would be another possible foe.\nBoxing fans were surprised when Pacquiao and his camp chose to challenge Timothy Bradley in a rubber match on April 9, 2016, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas for the WBO International welterweight title. According to Pacquiao, this was to be his last fight as a professional.\nOn February 22, Philippine senatorial candidate Walden Bello asked the Commission of Elections (COMELEC) to cancel Pacquiao's fight against Bradley, because it will give the boxer-politician free publicity, violating the Republic Act 9006 or the Fair Elections Act. The fight will fall in the 90-day national candidates campaign period for the national elections. Arum said in an interview that the fight's cancellation is not yet an option and stated that there is no conflict-of-interest between the fight and Pacquiao's senatorial campaign.\nPrior to this bout, Pacquiao and Bradley were regarded as the two most accomplished and best welterweights in the world by the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, BoxingScene and ESPN and two top-five best pound-for-pound fighters. Pacquiao won the match via unanimous decision to capture the vacant WBO International and lineal welterweight titles. This makes him the only fighter in history to win lineal championships in five different weight classes. In addition, Pacquiao became only the third fighter in boxing history to win three lineal crowns in the divisions alternatively referred to as the \"original\", \"major\" or \"glamour'\" divisions (flyweight, featherweight and welterweight), joining the exclusive club of Bob Fitzsimmons and Henry Armstrong who have won a legitimate world championship in three of the original eight weight divisions. After the match, Pacquiao said, \"As of now, I am retired\" and later shared \"I'm going to go home and think about it. I want to be with my family. I want to serve the people.\"\nComeback.\nOn June 23, 2016, it was reported that Pacquiao would return to boxing ring later that year after a brief retirement. In an interview with BoxingScene, Top Rank president Bob Arum said: \"Well we gotta see. If he will fight this year, then he will fight next year. We are thinking about him fighting in October if he wants to fight. Once I get the opponent that I am working on – we are working on opponents and once I get that, I will fly over to the Philippines and he will see if his schedule in the senate allows him to train for a fight and participate in a fight. I know he wants to continue fighting but the impediment is how labor intensive his work as a Filipino senator is and he is not going to really know that for another week or so. He was just sworn in as a senator yesterday,\" According to Yahoo! Sports, Arum reserved Mandalay Bay for October 15, just in case Pacquiao decides to continue fighting in the ring. Arum said: \"I'm not sure Manny is going to return, but I believe he wants to return. The question is, can he return and yet fulfill his duties as a senator in the Philippines? I don't think even he knows that answer yet, because he's just taken office.\"\nAccording to a BoxingScene report, Arum said that Pacquiao has even brought up with the Senate leadership the possibility of taking a leave of absence to train for a fight: \"He is going to fight. I don't know what the date is. He is working with the President of the Philippines Senate for an appropriate date where he can leave the Philippines for two or three weeks to prepare for the fight.\" There were also reports that a fight between Pacquiao and former four-division world champion Adrien Broner was being negotiated, something embraced by Pacquiao's longtime trainer Freddie Roach. But Arum, for his part, said Broner priced himself out of the fight: \"That is correct (that Broner priced himself out). I was dealing with (Broner's adviser) Al Haymon on making that fight. Al tried but Broner was asking for crazy money that nobody can afford so he is out and Manny is looking for another opponent.\" Arum told in an interview. Other leading candidates for Pacquiao's comeback were WBO welterweight champion Jessie Vargas, WBC welterweight champion Danny García and the winner of the July 23 light welterweight title unification bout between WBO light welterweight champion Terence Crawford and WBC light welterweight champion Viktor Postol.\nOn July 13, Pacquiao responded to rumors that he intends to take a leave of absence from the Philippine Senate for an upcoming bout – as stated by Top Rank Promotions head, Bob Arum. In his official statement; Pacquiao denied such rumors and assured the public that his current priority is to fulfill his duties as a legislator of the Philippines: \"There is no truth to media reports that I'm planning to take a leave from my senate duties just to fight again atop the ring. I want to make it clear – my priority is my legislative works.\nMy next fight has not yet been discussed. Should there be any, I'll make sure it will not interfere with my senate duties. When I ran for senator last May 9 elections, I made a promise to be present in all sessions. I owe it to the people.\nIf ever I decide to fight again, rest assured, it will happen when congress is on recess so there's no need for me to go on leave. The entire training will be done in the Philippines to ensure I can attend sessions even while on training camp.\nBoxing is my only means of livelihood to support my family and to help those who are in need. Politics, to me, is a vocation not a means to eke out a living.\nI want to maintain that belief. I want to keep my dignity intact while in public service.\nMay God continue to guide and bless all our endeavors.\"\nOn July 11, Arum said that Pacquiao will return to the ring sometime in the fall, likely either on October 29 or November 5, in the main event of a pay-per-view card staged in Las Vegas and televised by HBO. Arum said in an interview: \"He now has given us the go-ahead to shop for a venue and an opponent and see if we can do it on a particular date or dates. We've been trying to work out a date that doesn't interfere with his senatorial responsibilities and his ability to train.\" Subsequently, on July 18, Arum confirmed that Pacquiao was set to fight on November 5 at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nSenate President Franklin Drilon expressed his support for Pacquiao's reported plan to go back to boxing, confirming for the first time that the newly elected senator had sought his permission to fight again. Pacquiao adviser Michael Koncz said in a report that the southpaw, while committed to politics, is happiest when he is in the ring: \"Manny's primary concern and obligation is to fulfill his senatorial duties. But he just misses boxing. He misses the training. He misses being in the gym. You can see when he trains it's like a stress reliever for him. His mood changes. It's like he's in happy land. So I am working with Bob and Manny is working closely with the senate president to make sure the dates are okay. We're doing this properly.\"\nPacquiao vs. Vargas.\nOn August 3, Pacquiao's business manager confirmed that WBO welterweight champion Jessie Vargas (27–1) will be the next opponent for Pacquiao on November 5, at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center in Las Vegas, Nevada. Pacquiao made the confirmation after a two-hour meeting with Top Rank's Bob Arum and Canadian adviser Michael Koncz held in Manila on August 7, that he agreed to fight Vargas. \"Yes, the fight is on. I have agreed to a Nov. 5 fight with reigning WBO welterweight champion Jessie Vargas. Boxing is my passion. I miss what I'd been doing inside the gym and atop the ring. My entire training camp will be held here in the Philippines so I can attend to my legislative works. This is my campaign promise and I'm determined to keep it,\" Pacquiao said. He also explained that he has to fight again to earn a living: \"Boxing is my main source of income. I can't rely on my salary as public official. I'm helping the family of my wife and my own family, as well. Many people also come to me to ask for help and I just couldn't ignore them.\"\nOn August 11, it was revealed by Bob Arum that the fight will not be distributed by HBO PPV despite a contract with Pacquiao. HBO reportedly declined to carry the fight because they are already committed to hosting the anticipated November 19 fight between unified light heavyweight champion Sergey Kovalev and former lineal super middleweight champion Andre Ward and certainly the network couldn't handle two PPVs in one month and would prefer for Pacquiao to fight on October 29, along with the Wladimir Klitschko vs. Tyson Fury heavyweight championship match instead. But Arum said Pacquiao has to fight around his Philippine Senate schedule which effectively makes other fight dates impossible. Arum reiterated that if HBO will not produce or distribute the PPV, it will invalidate Pacquiao's contract with the network and make him a free agent: \"In my opinion, they have an obligation to distribute this fight. The fact that they passed means the contract is over, it seems clear to me. They can't pick and choose which fights they are going to distribute. They're either in breach of contract or they've ended the contract. My feeling is, based my legal background, is that the contract is terminated.\"\nHBO, on the other hand, believed that their existing contract with Pacquiao still stands, although they would not publicly comment on the disagreement otherwise. Arum said that HBO has no right to object to the date since he's putting up the money as the promoter while the network bears no risk. He also claims that their contract with the network clearly states that only Pacquiao's opponent has to be mutually agreed upon by both sides, not the date. HBO has televised nearly all of Pacquiao's major fights including 21 pay-per-views since 2003. According to Arum, possible distributor of the fight include cable giants Turner Broadcasting System, ESPN and HBO's rival network Showtime.\nIn a press conference on September 8 held in Los Angeles, California, it was announced by Bob Arum that the fight will be self-distributed by Top Rank PPV. He also revealed that his company will continue to produce and distribute future pay-per-view events without the involvement of HBO. As for the commentating panel, Arum stressed that he plans to put a star-studded announcing team, which will rival the work of HBO's Jim Lampley and Max Kellerman. Arum confided that he is in talks with major boxing analysts, but he declined to name one as he has not worked out any official deals yet. \"I think the commentating team is going to blow everybody's socks off,\" he vowed. According to Arum, Top Rank's initial plans have received a good feedback from its partners and television (TV) companies, which gives him a hindsight that they could pull it off. \"They're all very, very receptive to getting this kind of programming. But right now, this looks like the most likely scenario,\" Arum stated.\nOn September 26, Top Rank unveiled the broadcast team for the November 5 PPV bout featuring sports commentating stars Stephen A. Smith of ESPN, Brian Kenny of MLB Network, Charissa Thompson of Fox Sports and former two-division and five-time world champion Timothy Bradley as the ringside commentating team for the fight. The pay-per-view telecast would also feature WBO super bantamweight champion Nonito Donaire and WBO featherweight champion Óscar Valdez. This marked the first time Pacquiao and Donaire, the two biggest boxing stars to come out of the Philippines, had ever shared the same card.\nFloyd Mayweather Jr. made an entrance and sat ringside with his daughter before the main event began. When asked why he was at the fight, he replied, \"I'm just taking her to the fight.\", whilst pointing to his daughter. In front of 16,132 in attendance, Pacquiao defeated Vargas in a lopsided unanimous decision to win the WBO welterweight title for the third time. In the second round, Pacquiao caught Vargas with a straight left counter, dropping him to the canvas. In the eighth round, an accidental clash of heads opened a deep cut on Vargas’ right eyebrow. However, replays between rounds clearly showed that the cut above Vargas’ eye in the eighth was caused by a left straight punch, which the Nevada Athletic Commission has ruled. In the eleventh round, Vargas went down on a slip, tripping over his feet after he got hit by a right. Vargas went down again in the twelfth round, but Kenny Bayless ruled it another slip. Pacquiao won on all three judges' scorecards 118–109, 118–109, and 114–113. According to CompuBox statistics, Pacquiao landed 147 of 409 of his punches (36%) and Vargas landed 104 of 562 of his punches thrown (19%). Pacquiao was guaranteed $4 million plus a percentage of the revenue of the fight while Vargas was guaranteed $2.5 million. The bout sold 300,000 pay-per-view buys in the United States, earning an estimated $18 million in pay-per-view revenue.\nPacquiao vs. Horn.\nOn February 26, 2017, both Pacquiao and Amir Khan announced on Twitter that they would face each other on April 23 in a \"super fight\". The United Arab Emirates (UAE) specifically Abu Dhabi, were front runners to host the fight worth potentially £30 million, with the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) also being possibilities. Pacquiao was initially in negotiations to fight Jeff Horn in Australia, but held a poll asking the fans who he should fight next. Khan won the poll, thus setting up the fight. The Sevens Stadium in Dubai, Zayed Sports City Stadium and Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi were being considered as the venue. Speaking to Bob Arum on March 1, Pacquiao's adviser Michael Koncz confirmed the fight would take place on May 19 in the United States which means it would be a Friday night PPV and May 20 in the Middle-East. In the early morning of March 2, Bob Arum stated that the date of the fight was not close to being set with Khan's representatives. Later that day, Khan's camp confirmed they had agreed the revised fight date. Bob Arum told ESPN on March 8 that there was never a deal in place for the fight to take place, \"It's kaddish for the UAE deal. It's dead.\" Arum also mentioned that if there was any chance the fight can take place, it would be in the second half of 2017 and that Khan would not be Pacquiao's next opponent.\nOn March 27, Arum told the \"International Business Times\" (\"IBT\") that Pacquiao vs. Horn was back on. A likely date of July 2, 2017, was discussed. On April 1, it was confirmed that Horn had signed the contract at his end and was waiting for Pacquiao, who was believed to have received the contract. He and his team were going over the terms. \"We have to get the contract signed. They’re reviewing the contract and hopefully it will be signed in the next hours or so. On the Australian side, everything is done. Jeff Horn has signed the contract,\" Arum told \"The Star\". Arum later stated that there was no deadline for an agreement to be reached before declaring 'everything is done'. It was reported by \"The Manila Times\" on April 7 that Pacquiao had signed for the fight to take place at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, Australia. It was noted that he would start training in the first week of May. Around 55,000 fans around the world were expected to be in attendance and the event would pump at least $24 million into the local economy. On April 10, Carl Moretti told ESPN the fight was close to being finalized. Bob Arum officially announced the fight on April 10, billed as \"The Battle of Brisbane\". On June 1, it was reported that 40,000 tickets had been sold within over a month left for the fight. On June 19, 2017, it was announced that ESPN and Top Rank finalized a deal that would air the bout live on ESPN. This marked the first time that a Pacquiao fight would not be on pay-per-view since his co-main event fight against Héctor Velázquez on September 10, 2005.\nIn front of 51,052, Pacquiao lost a hard-fought fight via a controversial unanimous decision when the three judges scored it 117–111, 115–113, and 115–113 in favor of Horn. Many pundits, current and former boxers believed Pacquiao had done enough to retain the WBO title. Although Horn was the aggressor and showed determination throughout the fight, it nearly came to an end in round nine when Pacquiao took control and looked for the stoppage. Horn survived the round and was told by referee Mark Nelson, that he needed to show competitiveness or else he would stop the fight. Despite now having lost four of his last nine fights, Pacquiao remained humble, \"I’m professional. I respect the judges.\" It was reported that Horn would receive $500,000 from this fight and Pacquiao was guaranteed at least $10 million. Pacquiao stated he would activate the rematch clause and fight Horn again at the end of 2017. CompuBox stats showed that Pacquiao landed 182 out of 573 punches thrown (32%), whilst Horn landed 92 of 625 thrown (15%).\nPost-fight stats showed that Pacquiao landed almost double the number of punches that Horn landed. Dieter Kurtenbach of Fox Sports described the fight as \"rigged\", and T. J. Quinn of ESPN commented, \"No way in hell Horn won unanimously,\" he tweeted. \"A 117–111 card? Ridiculous. This is a hometown hit job. Manny looked old, but mostly in control\".\nIn regards to the controversial scorecards, ESPN's Dan Rafael scored the fight 117–111 and ESPN analyst Teddy Atlas scored it 116–111, both for Pacquiao. \"The Guardian\" and the \"IBT\" also scored the fight in favor of Pacquiao as well, 117–111. BoxingScene had it 116–112 for Pacquiao, while CBS Sports scored the fight 114–114 even. BoxNation's Steve Bunce scored the fight 115–113 for Horn. In total, 12 of 15 media outlets scored the bout for Pacquiao, 2 of 15 outlets ruled in favor of Horn and 1 scored a draw. Pacquiao claimed Horn got away with numerous dirty tactics in the fight, using illegal blows including elbows and headbutts, causing him to be cut on three different occasions during the fight.\nOn July 6, 2017, the WBO announced that it would re-score the Manny Pacquiao vs. Jeff Horn fight but the result would still stand. The WBO rescored the fight 7 rounds to 5 in favour of Horn. Top Rank CEO Bob Arum said the result of the WBO's review \"doesn't settle anything.\" Arum stated: \"First of all they didn't [rule] that Jeff Horn clearly won the fight. They (WBO) had five judges scoring the fight: three had Horn winning narrowly, one had it a draw, one had Pacquiao winning.\" Pacquiao was 'not surprised' with the re-score and vowed to fight on and continue his professional boxing career.\nPacquiao vs. Matthysse.\nOn January 16, 2018, it was first reported that Pacquiao would return to the ring on the undercard of Terence Crawford vs. Jeff Horn for the WBO welterweight championship on April 21. Arum wanted the card to take place at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas and have the card take place on ESPN PPV. Early rumours indicated he would fight 37-year-old former WBO light welterweight champion Mike Alvarado (38–4). On February 2, after winning the vacant WBA (Regular) welterweight title against Tewa Kiram, Lucas Matthysse (39–4–0–1) stated he was interested in fighting Pacquiao next. Freddie Roach as well as Golden Boy Promotions Eric Gomez liked the idea of the fight happening. Arum was also open to fight taking place, but stated it wouldn't happen next as he was likely to match Pacquiao with Alvarado. On March 1, Pacquiao withdrew from the Crawford-Horn card. According to Aquiles Zonio, Pacquiao's media relations officer, Pacquiao felt it was an insult to have him in a non-main event roll and felt he was the obvious ticket seller for the card, also believing he beat Horn in their fight in 2017. In an interview, Pacquiao told ABS-CBN television he would fight in Malaysia, where he has a group willing to put up the necessary funds, in May or June 2018. It was said that Pacquiao's MP Promotions would promote the event with a confirmed date of June 24. Arum played down the talks and said the fight had not been finalized. Pacquiao started training for the potential bout on March 12. Although the fight wasn't officially announced, the date was pushed back to July 8. Pacquiao explained the reason the date had changed was because June 24 would have fallen 10 days after the Islamic month, Ramadan and more than 60% of Malaysia's population are Muslim.\nOn April 2, the fight was officially confirmed for July 14, US time in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Pacquiao would go into the fight without long-time trainer Freddie Roach and instead be trained by his life-long friend Buboy Fernandez, who had served as an assistant trainer in previous fights. It would mark the first time in 34 fights, since 2001 that Roach would not be in Pacquiao's corner. It was noted that Top Rank would deal with the television distribution of the fight in the United States with the fight taking place on ESPN+, at the time, ESPN's new monthly subscription streaming service. For the fight to take place during primetime hours in the US due to the time difference, the bout would take place on Sunday morning, July 15 in Malaysia. On April 13, it was officially rumored that Pacquiao had parted ways with Roach. However, on April 15, Pacquiao revealed via social media that he had not decided on who would train him for the bout against Matthysse. On May 18, according to sources in Argentina, the fight was in jeopardy and likely to be postponed. However, Pacquiao denied the reports a day later and called the rumours \"malicious and untrue.\" By July 1, there were still doubts about the fight taking place, notably from Bob Arum. However, Pacquiao told Philboxing.com the preparations were in the final stages and the funds would be released to Golden Boy in the coming days. On July 2, Golden Boy and Matthysse confirmed receipt of funds and proposed to fly out to Malaysia the next day.\nThe fight took place at the Axiata Arena. Pacquiao scored his first knockout in over eight years by stopping Matthysse in round seven to win the WBA (Regular) welterweight title. Pacquiao dropped Matthysse a total of three times before the fight was stopped. The knockdowns occurred in rounds three, five and seven. Matthysse took a knee in the fifth round and was decked by a left hook in the seventh, following a combination. Referee Kenny Bayless began the count, stopping the fight at 2:43 after Matthysse spat out his mouthpiece. At the time of the stoppage, all three judges had the bout 59–53 in favor of Pacquiao. Speaking about the game plan, Pacquiao said, \"Matthysse has the power, so hands up all the time and do my best. I'm surprised because Matthysse is a very tough opponent and I knocked him down. I was focused and patient in the fight, and I worked hard in training. We did a good job in training. We were pushing hard.\" Matthysse had no excuses, stating he lost to \"a great fighter and a great champion.\" At the post-fight press conference, Pacquiao confirmed he would continue boxing. According to CompuBox, Pacquiao landed 95 of 344 punches thrown (28%), this included a 44% connect rate on his power punches. Matthysse landed 57 of his 246 thrown (23%), only landing in double figures in round six. On August 2, Matthysse announced his retirement from professional boxing at the age of 35.\nPacquiao vs. Broner.\nAfter Pacquiao signed with Al Haymon in October 2018, reports circulated that Adrien Broner was the front-runner to face him in January 2019. On October 18, 2018, Pacquiao confirmed that the deal was almost complete. On November 19, 2018, a press conference was held in New York City to confirm the fight between Pacquiao and Broner on January 19, 2019, for the WBA (Regular) welterweight title. Pacquiao reunited with long-time trainer Freddie Roach, who supervised the whole training camp, while Buboy Fernandez did the mitts and physical parts of the training due to Pacquiao's concern of Roach's health. The fight took place at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, Nevada and was distributed by Showtime PPV. Pacquiao was guaranteed at least $20 million from the fight, with $10 million being his base purse and the remainder made up from PPV revenue, Filipino TV rights, sponsorship and merchandise. Broner was paid a $2.5 million fight purse.\nPacquiao successfully defended his WBA (Regular) welterweight title against Broner via unanimous decision and never seemed troubled throughout the fight. In the seventh round, Pacquiao trapped Broner against the ropes and unloaded a barrage of punches that prompted Broner to tie him up. Pacquiao then continued his onslaught after the break, but Broner survived the round. Two rounds later, Pacquiao landed a huge left hand that sent Broner reeling backwards. All three judges ruled in favor of Pacquiao 117–111, 116–112, and 116–112. According to CompuBox, Pacquiao landed 82 out of 197 of his power punches (42%) against Broner's 39 out of 180 power punches (22%). Total punch stats were 112 out of 568 (20%) for Pacquiao and 50 out of 295 (17%) for Broner. This marked Broner's career low for total punches landed at 50, his previous low was 90 against Jessie Vargas. During the post-fight interview, Jim Gray asked Pacquiao if a Floyd Mayweather Jr. rematch would happen and Pacquiao answered, \"Tell him to come back to the ring, and we will fight.\" Mayweather, who was ringside, was asked by Gray to nod at the camera if he wanted a rematch with Pacquiao but Mayweather did not give an answer.\nThe fight sold 400,000 pay-per-view buys in the United States, earning an estimated $30 million in pay-per-view revenue. The bout produced a live gate of $6 million from 11,410 tickets sold. The final attendance was reported to be 13,025.\nPacquiao vs. Thurman.\nPacquiao defeated Keith Thurman via split decision for Thurman's WBA (Super) welterweight title on July 20, 2019, in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Late in the first round, Pacquiao caught Thurman with a right hand to the chin after a left to the body and knocked him down as he was moving backwards. The first five rounds were vintage for Pacquiao; he bloodied Thurman's nose and forced him into a very intense fight. Thurman looked to have regained his composure in the middle rounds, adjusted to Pacquiao's offense in the second half of the fight and was able to catch him with some hard shots. But in the tenth round, Pacquiao caught Thurman again; this time, it was a vicious left hook to the body that had him moving around the ring, trying to survive the round. Thurman was visibly hurt by the body shot; he later admitted, \"The body shot was a terrific body shot. I even took my mouthpiece out of my mouth just so I could breathe a little deeper\". Glenn Feldman scored the bout 114–113 for Thurman; Dave Moretti and Tim Cheatham both scored it 115–112 for Pacquiao. Many people, including Pacquiao himself, felt that the first-round knockdown and the tenth-round body shot rightfully secured him the win.\nAccording to CompuBox, Thurman was the more accurate boxer and out-landed Pacquiao. Pacquiao only landed 113 out of 340 of his power punches (33%) against Thurman's 192 out of 443 power punches (43%). Pacquiao was the busier fighter and had a difference of more than 100 punches compared to Thurman. Total punch stats were 195 out of 686 (28%) for Pacquiao and 210 out of 571 (37%) for Thurman. The bout sold 500,000 pay-per-view buys in the United States, earning an estimated $37.5 million in pay-per-view revenue.\nWith the victory, Pacquiao also became the first boxer to become a recognized four-time welterweight champion, breaking his tie with Jack Britton and Emile Griffith. He also became the oldest welterweight champion in boxing history at the age of 40.\nOn January 29, 2021, Pacquiao was stripped of his title due to inactivity, with WBA (Regular) champion Yordenis Ugás being elevated to the status of WBA (Super) champion. Pacquiao himself was designated \"champion in recess\" by the WBA.\nCancelled bout vs. Errol Spence Jr..\nOn May 21, 2021, Pacquiao made an announcement on his social media that he would return to the ring on August 21 in Las Vegas to face undefeated unified WBC and IBF welterweight champion Errol Spence Jr. on Fox PPV. PBC and Fox confirmed the news, and it was reported that both men have signed contracts to face each other. The two men had previously already met more than two years prior on March 16, 2019, in the ring following Spence's unanimous decision victory over Mikey Garcia in Arlington, Texas, when both Pacquiao and Spence indicated they would relish the chance to fight each other. It was officially announced on June 23 that the bout would take place at the T-Mobile Arena.\nHowever, on August 10, it was announced that Spence was forced to pull out of the bout due to suffering an injury to his left eye.\nPacquiao vs. Ugás.\nOn August 10, the bout against Spence was cancelled because of Spence's eye injury and is replaced by Yordenis Ugás, who was supposed to defend his WBA (Super) welterweight title on the undercard against Fabian Maidana. The new opponent meant that Pacquiao would now instead be challenging for the same title he had previously won by defeating Keith Thurman in 2019 and was subsequently stripped of. Pacquiao appeared to relish the opportunity, stating, \"The proper way and the only way to win a world title is inside the ring.\" Prior to the fight, Pacquiao admitted that his bout with Ugás may be the final fight of his career.\nThe bout was a competitive affair, with Ugás using his jab and looping right hand effectively to control the distance. While Pacquiao had moments of success throughout the night, he never truly settled into a rhythm and was noticeably stiffer than usual, not showcasing the deft footwork that he has been known for throughout his career. Pacquiao himself admitted after the fight that his legs were \"tight\". At the final bell, Ugás was awarded a unanimous decision victory with scores of 116–112, 116–112 and 115–113. According to CompuBox, Pacquiao threw over double the number of punches compared to Ugás, but landed fewer, making the latter the far more accurate boxer on the night. Pacquiao landed 130 punches of 815 thrown (16%), while Ugás landed 151 punches of 405 thrown (37.3%).\nIn his post-fight interview, Pacquiao addressed the speculation that he would imminently retire from the sport of boxing: \"I don't know. Let me rest first and relax and make a decision if I fight again.\" He also stated that he would make an announcement in September as to whether or not he would run for President of the Philippines. On August 25, Pacquiao said he was considering the idea of a January 2022 rematch against Ugás: \"Yes, I can come back in January. I will see about it. I know I can rematch him if I want. I'll just need to tell Al Haymon. That would be no problem.\"\nRetirement.\nOn September 19, 2021, Pacquiao announced that he would be running for President of the Philippines in the 2022 Philippine presidential election, after being nominated by a faction of the ruling party PDP-Laban. The following day, he indicated his retirement from boxing, telling Toni Gonzaga in an interview: \"My boxing career is already over. It's done because I've been in boxing for a long time and my family says that it is enough.\"\nOn September 29, 2021, Pacquiao officially announced his retirement from boxing in a post on social media.\nExhibition bouts.\nPacquiao vs. Salud.\nOn August 20, 2002, Pacquiao faced former WBA super bantamweight champion Jesus Salud in an exhibition match in Honolulu, as one of the undercard of Gerry Peñalosa vs. Seiji Tanaka. Pacquiao defeated Salud in the three-round exhibition match.\nPacquiao vs. Yoo.\nOn December 11, 2022, in the Korea International Exhibition Center, Pacquiao fought a 6 round exhibition match against South Korean martial artist, DK Yoo. Pacquiao won the exhibition by unanimous decision.\nPacquiao vs. Buakaw.\nPacquiao was expected to fight Muay Thai fighter Buakaw Banchamek in an exhibition match in January, 2024, but the date was pushed back to April 20, 2024. On July 21, 2023, Pacquiao and Buakaw met in a press conference held in Bangkok, Thailand to promote their exhibition superfight. Their exhibition match is set to take place at a 155 lbs catchweight and will be contested under the international boxing rules. The fight is scheduled for six three-minute rounds, with two-minute break in between rounds.\nPay-per-view bouts.\nPPV home television.\nThe following fights were broadcast on pay-per-view television.\nClosed-circuit theatre TV.\nThe following fight was telecast at American closed-circuit theatre TV venues."

He played at representative level for Yorkshire, and at club level for Wakefield Trinity (Heritage № 218), as a , i.e. number 2 or 5.\nPlaying career.\nJohn Todd made his début for Wakefield Trinity during October 1914, and he played his last match for Wakefield Trinity during February 1921, he appears to have scored no drop-goals (or field-goals as they are currently known in Australasia), but prior to the 1974–75 season all goals, whether; conversions, penalties, or drop-goals, scored 2-points, consequently prior to this date drop-goals were often not explicitly documented, therefore '0' drop-goals may indicate drop-goals not recorded, rather than no drop-goals scored. In addition, prior to the 1949–50 season, the archaic field-goal was also still a valid means of scoring points.\nCounty honours.\nJohn Todd won cap(s) for Yorkshire while at Wakefield Trinity."

The third Kenyan, Asbel Kiprop went to his typical position marking the back of the pack. After a moderate lap, controlling the pace, Kiprop moved forward and the two leaders accelerated to a quick five metre breakaway. In the next half lap, that break expanded to 10 metres with only Kiprop able to bridge the gap. Through the next half lap, three men, led by Filip Ingebrigtsen (NOR), followed by Adel Mechaal (ESP) and Sadik Mikhou (BHR) were able to bridge the gap, with Ingebrigtsen able to reach the trailing Kiprop on the inside at the bell. Ingebrigtsen was able to hold the inside, making Kiprop run to the outside through the penultimate turn. Down the backstretch Mechaal was also able to pass Kiprop, who was struggling. The sweep was broken but Cheruiyot and Manangoi were still in front, Cheruiyot holding the leading inside position. Coming off the turn, Manangoi displayed some of his reputed 46 second (400) speed, running past his teammate and on to a 2-metre victory. Three metres behind, Mechaal made a serious move to try to get ahead of Ingebrigtsen, trying to pass in the narrow space on the inside. He got his shoulders as far as Ingebrigtsen's 10 metres prior to the finish but couldn't get by, both men struggling and falling toward the finish line. Ingebrigtsen leaned for the bronze medal position while Mechaal put his hand out onto Ingebrigtsen's back. Ingebrigtsen fell into a sideways somersault after the finish, both finishing just ahead of a fast closing Jakub Holuša (CZE).\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 3:36.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 10 August in three heats as follows:\nThe first six in each heat ( Q ) and the next six fastest ( q ) qualified for the semifinals.

        "text": "The men's 5000 metres at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the London Olympic Stadium on . This race was announced as the last track race of Mo Farah's career as he intends to focus on marathon running and road racing. Farah had been in every final since 2007, winning three straight since 2011.\nSummary.\nIn the final, Farah (GBR) started faster than normal, after the pack congealed landing in second place behind Paul Chelimo (USA) who ran around the crowd to get to the front. Chelimo took the field through an aggressive 62 second lap. The second lap was a decidedly more relaxed 71 seconds, bringing Andrew Butchart (GBR) to the front, to look at Chelimo then take the point with his teammate Farah in tow. But Butchart didn't increase the pace, instead it slowed slightly to 72 seconds. Muktar Edris (ETH) came forward. After running shoulder to shoulder with Farah for 200 metres, Edris went out into the lead, but the pace didn't quicken. After another slow lap, he slowed and left Farah exposed on the front. 17 year old 2016 World Junior Champion Selemon Barega came from the back of the pack to take the lead. Barega increased the pace opening up several metres on Farah at the head of the pack with a 65-second lap, then he slowed again an Ethiopian leaving Farah exposed on the front of the pack. Another 66 second lap as Chelimo came back to take a turn at the front.\nWith five laps to go Patrick Tiernan ran around the field to take the lead. Tiernan moved the pace up to 64 seconds but the rest of the field didn't chase, letting him break away to a 10-metre lead. The next lap was under 63 seconds, with Yomif Kejelcha (ETH) coming to the front of the pack but leaving Farah to lead the group. Into the last two laps, a time when Farah does not like to get passed, he stayed ahead of Kejelcha, the overall quicken pace overtaking Tiernan with 600 metres to go. Shortly after passing Tiernan, Butchart rushed forward to get on Farah's shoulder to form a British wall similar to the ending stages of the Olympics. Through the turn, Kejelcha fought his way around the outside of the wall and onto the homestretch to take the lead going into the bell with the rest of the Ethiopian team, Edris and Barega lining up on the outside, next to Farah, Mohammed Ahmed (CAN), and Chelimo on the inside. At the bell, Edris was shoulder to shoulder with Farah.\nThrough the penultimate turn, Edris got ahead of Farah and onto the back of Kejelcha. The two Ethiopians opened up a 2-metre lead on Farah on the backstretch, leaving Farah in the unfamiliar position of having to sprint to catch up. But Chelimo had more speed, catching Farah from behind and moving to his outside shoulder as they gained on the Ethiopian duo, effectively leaving Farah boxed in on the curb. Coming off the final turn, Farah was looking for running room, which suddenly materialized in front of him as Kejelcha drifted out. Edris sprinted away from his teammate while Farah was still weaving his way past Kejelcha, with Chelimo going the outside route, both two metres behind Edris. Farah's race was for second place, with Edris expanding his lead to the finish. Farah was able to barely hold off Chelimo for silver. Unlike the spring in his step following his previous string of victories, it was Farah lying exhausted on the track.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nNo records were set at the competition.\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 13:22.60.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 9 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first five in each heat ( Q ) and the next five fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

Paul Rodriguez had been sponsored by Plan B Skateboards, but quit the team out of a desire to have more ownership and control over his career. After Paul's departure from Plan B, he printed and sold a limited run of 500 gold-foil Primitive decks, and due to the strong response, decided to launch an ongoing skateboard company, with the help of Andy and Jubal.\nTen months after Paul Rodriguez's departure from Plan B, Primitive Skateboarding was officially announced on April 10, 2014. The original team was Paul Rodriguez as a pro, with Carlos Ribeiro and Nick Tucker as amateurs.\nCollaborations.\nPrimitive has featured a number of collaborations that featured rappers like Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. along with various anime and cartoon programs such as Dragon Ball Z, Rick and Morty, Naruto, and Sailor Moon."

This was billed to be the final 10,000 metres race of two-time champion Mo Farah. Farah won the race, ahead of Joshua Cheptegei from Uganda with Paul Tanui of Kenya finishing third. The win was Farah's third consecutive World 10,000 metres title, and his fifth consecutive major (Olympic or world) 10,000 metres title.\nSummary.\nJoshua Cheptegei, Geoffrey Kipsang Kamworor and Moses Kurong formed an early breakaway, Kurong taking the lead for a few laps before Cheptegei went back to the front, and nine laps into the race, Kamworor, and then Paul Tanui, took the lead. By 6,000 metres, there was a lead group of 14 runners at the front, but this group gradually got smaller. Farah hit the front just before four laps to go. He let Abadi Hadis resume the lead, and at one point Kamworor had his heels caught by Farah as he cut across in front. Just before two laps to go, Farah went back into the lead.\nDuring the penultimate turn, Tanui clipped the back of Farah's heels causing him to briefly lose his stride. Tanui sprinted through the final turn trying to get even with Farah at the head of the final straight. Farah turned to look at him, then accelerated away, already celebrating his win with ten metres remaining. Cheptegei sprinted around Tanui, but could not catch Farah and took second.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 27:45.00.\nResults.\nThe final took place on 4 August at 21:20.

By 15 kilometres there were still 31 and by half way only another three had started to fall off the back. Then the racing began as a small group went off the front including the entire Kenyan team, a Kenyan Turkish transplant, two Ethiopians, two Eritreans, Alphonce Simbu from Tanzania and Hawkins. Of that group, Geoffrey Kirui, Tamirat Tola and Gideon Kipketer were pushing the pace as a three man pack. Kipketer faltered and it was a two man race with Simbu breaking off the front of the second pack. About 10 kilometres from the finish, Tola tried to break away. But the one breaking was Tola as Kirui came back and then set off on his own. Over the last seven kilometres, Kirui opened up almost a minute and half of daylight, comfortably crossing the line for the gold. Tola struggled to successfully hold off Simbu to keep silver while an inspired Hawkins picked up the pieces and finished a strong fourth just 26 seconds back.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nNo records were set at the competition.\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 2:19.00.\nResults.\nThe final took place on 6 August at 10:54.

She was the Olympic Champion from Rio and the world leader by a huge margin. Defending champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce did not compete as she expected her first child. Returning silver medallist Dafne Schippers did not seem to be in her best shape, while the bronze medallist from 2015, Tori Bowie was expected to be among the medal contenders.\nIn the first semi-final, Marie-Josée Ta Lou won by 0.11 seconds over Dafne Schippers. Elaine Thompson proved why she was the favourite, winning her semi-final in 10.84 seconds, the fastest time of the day, ahead of Rosângela Santos who broke the South American continental record, while Bowie ran 10.91 seconds to win the third semi-final.\nIn the final, Ta Lou established an early lead. Thompson had the slowest reaction to the gun and failed to get into contention. Bowie, who had been closing on the leader, leaned early for her dip at the line, winning and then stumbling to the track. Returning silver medallist Dafne Schippers took bronze. \nBowie's injury at the end of the race caused her to drop out of the 200 metres.\nRecords.\nRecords before the competition:\nRecords set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard for automatic qualification was 11.26 s.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), was:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 5 August in six heats:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next six fastest ( q ) qualified for the semifinals.

Elaine Thompson, this event's silver medallist at the 2015 World Championships and gold medallist at the 2016 Olympics, did not compete. Also missing was Tori Bowie, the world leader and 100 metres gold medallist at these World Championships. Schippers' strongest challengers of the remaining athletes were considered to be Marie-Josée Ta Lou from the Ivory Coast, who won the silver medal in the 100 metres at these championships; Shaunae Miller-Uibo from the Bahamas, who won the gold medal in the 400 metres at the 2016 Olympic Games; and the U.S. athletes.\nIn the final, shorter sprinters like Ta Lou and Dina Asher-Smith from Great Britain were out of the blocks faster. By her fourth stride, Schippers was into her running motion and gaining with fewer strides than her shorter competitors. By the end of the turn, Schippers had a metre lead on Ta Lou and more than a two-metre lead on Asher-Smith. Down the stretch, Ta Lou gained ground on the lead, while behind them the tall Miller-Uibo was moving past Asher-Smith. Still, Schippers' lead held up for the win in 22.05 seconds.

Hellen Obiri (KEN) moved to Ayana's shoulder. Then Sifan Hassan ran around the crowd to take the lead. In control of the front, Hassan didn't speed up, she slowed the pace to a virtual walk. Everyone obliged until the last few metres when Ayana broke free off the front. They passed the first lap in 1:21.77. Ayana's second lap of 1:18.98 didn't improve the pace much, but it separated all three Ethiopians and all three Kenyans to the front. Gezahegne rushed forward to take another temporary lead before fading back through the pack for good. From there it was Ayana setting the pace, but a pack of others, led by Hellen Obiri (KEN) were determined not to let her get away. Ayana accelerated but Obiri stuck to her, creating a ten-second breakaway on the pack led by Hassan. With 300 metres to go, Obiri took off at a pace Ayana could not match, taking the pace from 68 second laps to the last 200 metres in under 30 seconds. Running even faster, Hasan separated from the pack and set off in chase of catching Ayana for silver but arriving two seconds too late.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition, the records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 15:22.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 10 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first five in each heat ( Q ) and the next five fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

Almaz Ayana, also from Ethiopia and the world record holder from the 2016 Summer Olympics, ran her first race of the year.\nThe race began at a leisurely pace, with Ayana hovering near the front, just behind a succession of leaders.

She then broke open the race with a 2:49.18 1000 metres, which was her quickest of the race, and extended her lead to 5.96 seconds at the halfway mark, with Yasemin Can from Turkey in second place. Her lead at 6000 metres grew to 16.84 seconds. Her 46:37 second margin of victory was the largest ever in a women's 10,000 metres at the World Championships. Her final 5000 meters was run in 14:24.94, which only seven women had bettered in a 5000 metres race.\nThe race for the silver medal was competitive among Dibaba, Alice Aprot Nawowuna, and Agnes Jebet Tirop.

Harrison held the lead until she rattled the third hurdle, where Pearson and Manning advanced, about even over the fourth hurdle, with a wall of Harrison, Dutkiewicz, Visser, Harper-Nelson and Alina Talay (BLR) mere inches behind. But Pearson was gaining a little ground at every hurdle as Harper-Nelson edged forward ahead of Manning. By the tenth barrier, Pearson had almost a metre lead, Harper Nelson another half metre on Manning, with Dutkiewicz and Harrison still just inches behind.

        "title": "2017 World Championships in Athletics – Women's 3000 metres steeplechase",
        "text": "The women's 3000 metres steeplechase at the 2017 World Championships in Athletics was held at the London Olympic Stadium on 9 and 11 August.\nSummary.\nSix-time US steeplechase champion Emma Coburn made history by becoming the first American since 1952 to win a world steeplechase title. In the process, the 26-year-old Olympic bronze medalist set a championship record of 9:02.58 and broke her own American record by five seconds. She finished just ahead of her teammate Courtney Frerichs, who ran a personal best of 9:03.77 to capture silver. The 1-2 finish was the first ever by Americans in any world championship distance race. Defending champion and Olympic silver medalist Hyvin Jepkemoi of Kenya took the bronze in 9:04.03.\nCoburn's gold medal performance came against the best field ever assembled for a world steeplechase final consisting of Area champions, World medalists, Olympians, and four of the five fastest women in the world.\nLead up to 2017 London.\nThe women's 3000 metres steeplechase was first introduced at the 2005 Helsinki World Championships. It didn't take long for Kenyan-born women to dominate the event winning two gold, two silver and four bronze medals in ten years. Milcah Chemos was first to strike gold at 2013 Moscow, followed by Hyvin Jepkemoi's world title at 2015 Beijing. The women's steeplechase became an Olympic event in 2008 where Kenyan-born women began to dominate, too. Ruth Jebet took Olympic gold at 2016 Rio and Hyvin Jepkemoi captured the silver medal. At the 2008 Olympics Kenya won silver and followed with a bronze medal performance in 2012.\nKenyan-born women had established record times, too. In just one year leading up to 2017 London, four runners would post times equal to or below the 9-minute mark that would rank them first, second, fourth and fifth on all-time list for fastest women in a 3000 metres steeplechase; Ruth Jebet at 8:52.78, Celliphine Chespol at 8:58.78, Hyvin Jepkemoi at 9:00.01 and Beatrice Chepkoech at 9:00.70.\nWhen the field for the 2017 London final was announced it was not surprising to see the line-up dominated by six Kenyan-born runners, although it was remarkable. The rules allow for a country to have only three entrants; however, Kenya gained a fourth spot for Hyvin Jepkemoi using the wild card entry reserved for defending champions. Running for Bahrain were two Kenyan expatriates; Ruth Jebet, the world record holder and Olympic champion, and 17-year-old Winfred Mutile Yavi. \nThe Kenyan national team featured Beatrice Chepkoech, the number one ranked runner in 2017, fourth-place finisher at the 2016 Olympics and third fastest in the world in 2017; Purity Kirui, 2014 Commonwealth Games champion, and Celliphine Chespol, reigning World U20 champion, who in May 2017 recorded the second fastest time in history for a women's steeplechase winning in 8:58.78 at the Prefontaine Classic in Eugene, Oregon.\n2017 saw a dramatic rise in performances amongst all women steeplechasers with 21 of the 31 fastest times in history run that year. Many races saw winning times well below the 9:42.00 qualifying standard with several victories occurring below 9:15.00. Medal hopefuls knew the 2017 London final would be run at a very fast pace and it would require outrunning the Kenyans. Jebet was the prerace favorite but was expected to be strongly challenged by Chepkoech for the title.\nThere were three preliminary heats at 2017 London in which the first three finishers in each heat qualified for the final plus the next overall six fastest runners. There were three notable athletes who failed to make the final or later withdrew. American Colleen Quigley finished third in the first heat but was later disqualified after the referee ruled an inside border lane infringement. On two separate occasions Quigley stepped on the inside white line that divides the track from the infield while exiting the water jump area. Quigley's disqualification allowed the fourth-place finisher, Kenya's Purity Kirui, to advance to the final. In the same preliminary heat, 2012 Olympic silver medalist Sofia Assefa from Ethiopia failed to qualify. She fell victim to a slow-paced race, finishing sixth, as she was unable to out-kick a six-person sprint to the finish. Assefa's finishing position was upgraded to fifth due to Quigley's disqualification. In the second heat, Ethiopian Birtukan Fente fell while crossing a water jump, injuring herself. Although she qualified, she later withdrew from the final.\nRace Details.\nSource:\nWhen the gun sounded to begin the final, Kenya's Beatrice Chepkoech went to the front and set a fast pace. There is a partial (half) lap at the beginning of all steeplechase races before the runners begin going over barriers. After the partial lap there are seven laps remaining in the race with 28 barriers and 7 water jumps to clear.\nJust one minute and 23 seconds into the race, and after going over the first three barriers, front-runner Chepkoech missed the inside turn for the water jump by continuing to run the track's oval as if it was a non-steeplechase event. A couple of runners started to follow her causing several runners to bump into each other. All but Chepkoech realized the mistake and ran towards the jump. It was only after hearing the reaction from the crowd and her teammate Chespol call to her, did she realize her error. To avoid being disqualified Chepkoech backtracked about 15 metres and cleared the jump, losing seven seconds to the leaders. Out of the chaos, Bahrain's Yavi took the lead followed by the two Americans, Coburn and Frerichs, then Jepkemoi, with Chepkoech now sprinting to catch the field.\nOn lap two, at the 2:12 mark, despite having trailed by 7 seconds, Chepkoech made a strong comeback, caught the field and worked her way into the middle of the pack. Moments later after clearing the second barrier she stumbled badly and fell, causing another runner to fall, and others needing to maneuver around the downed runners. German Olympian and 2015 World bronze medalist Gesa Felicitas Krause was an unfortunate recipient who found herself lying on the track and soon to be in last place. She righted herself to resume the race but would finish in ninth place. The turmoil at the rear of the pack suddenly caused a six-women breakaway to unfold consisting of Yavi, Jebet, Jepkemoi, Chespol, and the two Americans. Kenya's Purity Cherotich Kirui found herself halfway between both groups in seventh position, trailing the leaders by roughly six metres.\nAt 2:41, after crossing the water jump for the second time, Bahrain's Ruth Jebet passed Yavi to take the lead and stepped up the pace. Coburn and Frerichs, accepted the Bahraini's solid pace and settled into the rear of the lead pack occupying the fifth and sixth positions.\nThe first 1,000 metres were covered in 3:02.74.\nMaking her way through the fallen runner turmoil, Chepkoech managed to right herself and once again sprinted to catch the breakaway pack, eventually catching them at the 3:17 mark. By 3:52 she worked her way into fourth place before eventually moving into third. Jebet remained the leader for the next four and one-half laps setting a blistering pace. Only one woman, Chespol, had run under nine minutes in 2017; all eyes were now on the clock.\nThe second kilometre was covered in 3:00.86, with the first 2,000 metres run in 6:03.60.\nThe middle laps were mostly a six-person race as Bahrain's Yavi was dropped by the lead pack at the 4:30 mark.\nAt the 7:10 mark, the American Coburn began closing the gap between herself and the leader Jebet. She went from fifth place into third and would have likely moved to the front, however the other runners picked up on her challenge and held her off by stepping up the pace. At this point, the youngster Chespol, the reigning U20 world champion, could not respond to the fast pace and faded from the group.\nAround the 7:50 mark, Kenya's Chepkoech regained the lead and when the bell rang at 7:54 signaling the final lap, a five-person breakaway remained with Coburn in second place, positioned just off Chepkoech's outside shoulder, followed by Jebet, Jepkemoi, and Frerichs.\nWhen the group traversed the second barrier, with 300 metres remaining, Frerichs made a strong move to become the leader. Going down the back stretch she accelerated and ran should-to-shoulder with Chepkoech and Jepkemoi with Coburn a stride back. The fierce pace caused Bahrain's Jebet, the world record holder and 2016 Olympic champion to fade. With 250 metres to go the lead pack consisted of two Kenyans and two Americans runners.\nAt the 8:26 mark, the leaders crossed over the third barrier with Frerichs and Jepkemoi still running shoulder-to-shoulder followed closely by Coburn and then Chepkoech. The fast pace and energy expended to make up for earlier mistakes in the race was now having its effect on Chepkoech, as she began to slow, unable to keep up with the aggressive push by the Americans to overtake her teammate Jepkemoi.\nAs the three lead runners approached the last water jump Coburn made a decisive move and one which would allow her to capture gold. Coming into the turn, Jepkemoi lined up her approach so that she would go over the center of the water jump. By doing this, she forced Frerichs, who was on Jepkemoi's outside shoulder, to run wide and approach the jump from an outside tact. Seeing this, Coburn cut sharply and took advantage of the shorter, inside path, arriving at the jump just a few tenths of a second ahead of the other two runners. Coburn, known for her superior form and leaping ability, was the first over the jump at 8:40. Frerichs landed second then quickly cut in front of Jepkemoi, who struggled to make her way out of the water pit.\nCoburn, leading for the first time in the race, accelerated around the final turn and headed for the home stretch. She cleared the final barrier at 8:53 and sprinted to the finish, opening up a seven-metre lead over her teammate Frerichs. Coburn crossed the finish line at 9:02.58 for the gold medal. In an exciting duel, Frerichs was able to hold off Jepkemoi over the last 100 metres to take the silver, finishing with a personal best of 9:03.77. Jepkemoi took the bronze in 9:04.03 and Chepkoech finished fourth at 9:10.45.\nIt was the first time Americans, men or women, had ever finished 1–2 in any world championship distance race.\nThe final kilometre was covered in 2:58.98\nCoburn's time set a Continental record, Championship record, American record and was a personal best. Her performance ranks as sixth fastest on the all-time list for the women's 3000-metres steeplechase event; one spot ahead of Frerichs. Four of the five athletes ahead of them on the all-time list finished behind them in this race.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification standard.\nThe standard to qualify automatically for entry was 9:42.00.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 9 August in three heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next six fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

USA and Jamaica had smooth handoffs to Allyson Felix and Natasha Morrison respectively, but the British team had a hesitation on the handoff to Desirèe Henry, losing a slight amount of time. On the backstretch, Henry passed Germany's Lisa Mayer. Felix made a comfortable hand off to Morolake Akinosun slightly ahead of Jamaica's handoff to Simone Facey, GBR handing off to Dina Asher-Smith two steps later. Through the final turn, Germany's Gina Lückenkemper made up a lot of ground as the field tightened. At the final handoff Jamaica's Sashalee Forbes took a quick glance back, USA's Tori Bowie took a more serious look to make sure she got the baton, effectively in handoff style, while Germany to Rebekka Haase and the British to Daryll Neita used the more conventional blind handoffs to pull closer. Onto the straightaway, Bowie had a half metre lead over Forbes and Neita, who were virtually even. Neita looked to stay with Bowie for the first half of the straightaway, separating from Jamaica before Bowie put in some clear separation for the USA win. As Neita tightened, Forbes started to close but not enough for Jamaica to take the silver away from the British.\nRecords.\nBefore the competition records were as follows:\nThe following records were set at the competition:\nQualification criteria.\nThe first eight placed teams at the 2017 IAAF World Relays and the host country qualify automatically for entry with remaining places being filled by teams with the fastest performances during the qualification period.\nSchedule.\nThe event schedule, in local time (UTC+1), is as follows:\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe first round took place on 12 August in two heats as follows:\nThe first three in each heat ( Q ) and the next two fastest ( q ) qualified for the final.

        "title": "1963 NCAA University Division basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1963 NCAA University Division basketball championship game was the final of the 1963 NCAA University Division basketball tournament and determined the national champion in the 1962–63 NCAA University Division men's basketball season. The game was held on March 23, 1963, at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky. The matchup pitted the Loyola Ramblers, who were making their first NCAA tournament appearance, against the Cincinnati Bearcats, the two-time defending national champions. After trailing by 15 points in the second half, Loyola rallied to force an overtime period, and won the game 60–58 on a basket by Vic Rouse with one second left. The Ramblers earned their first championship in men's college basketball.\nBackground.\nCincinnati Bearcats.\nThe 1962–63 Bearcats were coached by Ed Jucker, who was in his third season on the job. In the previous two seasons, Cincinnati won the national championship, defeating Ohio State in the 1961 and 1962 national championship games. The Bearcats were attempting to become the first program ever to win the NCAA Tournament for a third consecutive year. They began the season as the number-one ranked team in the AP Poll. Their first game was a 97–39 win over DePauw on December 1, after which they defeated Virginia by 49 points. Cincinnati won its next three games by double-figure margins, before traveling to Kansas, where the team posted a 64–49 victory at Allen Fieldhouse. In their next contest, Dayton became the first team to avoid a double-digit defeat against the Bearcats, losing 44–37 in Cincinnati's lowest-scoring game of the season.\nAfter three more victories brought the Bearcats' record to 10–0, the team began play in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) with a January 5, 1963 home game against Wichita (now known as Wichita State), the eighth-ranked team in the country. By a 63–50 score, Cincinnati maintained their perfect record. The Bearcats remained undefeated through mid-February; their victories included a 62–53 win at third-ranked Illinois, along with seven MVC games. On February 16, the Bearcats suffered their first and only defeat of the regular season: in a second game against Wichita, the Shockers prevailed by one point, 65–64. Cincinnati won their next four games, ending the regular season with a 23–1 record. The Bearcats remained the top-ranked team in the AP Poll throughout the season, and they won the MVC championship with an 11–1 conference record, four games ahead of second-place Wichita.\nThe Bearcats played conservatively on offense and were the NCAA's leading defensive team statistically, allowing an average of 51.9 points a game to opponents. Their leading scorer was forward Ron Bonham, who averaged 21.0 points per game. Forward Tom Thacker had per-game averages of 15.8 points and 10.0 rebounds, while center George Wilson averaged 15.0 points and a team-high 11.2 rebounds per game. Other regular players included guards Larry Shingleton and Tony Yates, and Ken Cunningham and Dale Heidotting were among the bench players.\nCincinnati received an invitation to the 1963 NCAA tournament, where they were matched up with Texas in the Midwest regional semifinals. After not having to play in the first round, the Bearcats advanced to the regional final with a five-point win. The team then earned a place in the Final Four of the tournament by defeating Colorado 67–60. In the Final Four, they faced Oregon State. After leading by three points at halftime, the Bearcats clinched a berth in the national championship game with an 80–46 victory. Cincinnati held the Beavers to 28.8% shooting for the game, while making 54.9% of their shots; Wilson led the Bearcats with 24 points and made eight of his nine field goal attempts.\nLoyola-Chicago Ramblers.\nThe Ramblers, coached by George Ireland, began the season ranked fourth in the AP Poll. In their first game, against Christian Brothers on December 1, Loyola posted a 114–58 victory. After three more wins by margins of more than 45 points, the Ramblers scored 123 points against Western Michigan, their highest total of the season. A 12-point victory at Indiana followed, after which Loyola defeated 10th-ranked Seattle 93–83. The Ramblers remained undefeated entering 1963, and started the year as the number two team in the country. Their first game in 1963 was a 45-point win over Marshall; the Rambers ultimately won their first 21 games of the season. On February 16, Bowling Green State gave the Ramblers their first loss, by a score of 92–75. After wins in their next three games, Wichita defeated Loyola in the Ramblers' regular season finale, leaving them with a 24–2 record. The Ramblers finished third in the final AP Poll.\nIn contrast to Cincinnati, the Ramblers played an aggressive style of offensive basketball, and their defense frequently pressed the opposition. With an average point output of 93.9 per game, Loyola led the country in scoring. Jerry Harkness posted a team-high 21.4 points per game, and four other regulars—Les Hunter, John Egan, Vic Rouse, and Ron Miller—each averaged more than 13.0 points per game. Rouse was the Ramblers' leading rebounder, with 12.1 rebounds per game.\nLoyola's berth in the NCAA tournament was the first in program history. Unlike Cincinnati, the Ramblers were required to play in the first round; they were placed in the Mideast regional and faced Tennessee Tech. By a 69-point margin, they advanced to the regional semifinals and a matchup with the Mississippi State Bulldogs. At the time, teams from Mississippi were unofficially banned from playing against integrated opponents due to segregation policies in the state. According to \"USA Today's\" Mike Lopresti, the Bulldogs \"had to rush out of Starkville just to get to the tournament\" game in Michigan, which came against a Loyola team with four black starters. The action came despite an injunction in the state, and the resulting contest became known as the Game of Change. The Ramblers advanced with a 61–51 win over Mississippi State.\nIn the regional final against Illinois, the Ramblers gained a spot in the Final Four with a 15-point victory. There, they faced Duke, the second-ranked team in the country. Ireland, noting Duke's lack of experience against teams with African-American players, claimed before the game that \"Any good team with a predominantly Negro lineup could beat them. Behind 29 points by Hunter and 20 from Harkness, Loyola earned a place in the NCAA final by defeating Duke 94–75.\nGame summary.\nThe game took place on March 23 at Freedom Hall in Louisville, Kentucky, before an announced crowd of 19,153 spectators, a sellout. Prior to the championship game, a third-place game was held between Final Four losers Duke and Oregon State. The Blue Devils prevailed by an 85–63 score. Cincinnati had six players compete in the game: Bonham, Heidotting, Shingleton, Thacker, Wilson, and Yates. Loyola featured five players for the entire game: Egan, Harkness, Hunter, Miller, and Rouse. Seven of the 10 starters were African-American; this marked the first time that over half the players in the NCAA championship contest were black.\nLoyola's shooters started the game slowly, missing all but one of their first 14 field goal attempts. Early on, the Bearcats took a 19–9 lead, as picks by Shingleton set up Bonham to score. The Ramblers' poor shooting continued for the rest of the first half, as they missed 26 of 34 shots and Harkness was held scoreless. At halftime, the Bearcats held a 29–21 advantage. \"Sports Illustrated\"'s Ron Fimrite wrote that \"The Bearcats' lead was not so much the product of an impenetrable defense as of a Rambler offense decidedly out of whack.\"\nThe Bearcats extended their advantage at the beginning of the second half. Behind a streak of three consecutive field goals by Bonham, Cincinnati made five of six attempts at one point. Just over six minutes into the second half, the Bearcats held a 15-point advantage, 45–30. However, they were required to make a substitution a few minutes later after Wilson was called for a foul, his fourth of the game; he was briefly benched in favor of Heidotting. The Bearcats suffered from an accumulation of fouls as the second half progressed, as Thacker and Yates picked up four fouls each and neared the point of fouling out. Still, Cincinnati maintained a 48–36 lead into the final eight minutes. In response to the high number of Cincinnati players with numerous fouls, Jucker ordered his team to play more conservatively on offense, stalling to keep their lead intact; they were not required to shoot due to the lack of a shot clock. Hunter later cited this decision as a turning point, saying that it took the Bearcats out of their offensive rhythm. Cincinnati turned the ball over repeatedly, as Loyola made a scoring run that put them back into the game. After more than 35 minutes without a basket, Harkness made two in under 10 seconds, the second following a Bearcats turnover. The Ramblers' 18–3 run brought them to within 48–45. Cincinnati then stretched their lead back to five with 3:42 left in regulation, before the Ramblers made the score 50–48.\nAlthough Loyola had closed their deficit, the Bearcats continued to stall on offense. A field goal by Hunter cut Cincinnati's advantage to one point, 51–50, entering the final minute. The Bearcats came out of their stall and ran a fast break, which was capped by a Thacker basket. With 17 seconds on the clock, Hunter responded by scoring again, bringing the Ramblers back within one point. Harkness fouled Shingleton with 12 seconds on the clock, sending him to the free throw line for two attempts. Making both would put the Bearcats on the verge of winning the NCAA championship, as there were no three-point field goals at the time. After making one free throw, Shingleton was off on his second try, and Hunter secured the rebound for Loyola. Miller received the ball and juggled it briefly; Ireland and Fimrite believed that he had been guilty of traveling, but it was not called a violation on the court. Miller passed the ball to Harkness, who attempted a 12-foot jumper. His shot was good, tying the game at 54–54. Jucker attempted to call a timeout, but the referees did not hear his request due to crowd noise and the clock expired with the game still tied. A five-minute overtime period was required to break the deadlock. Three previous NCAA finals had needed one, including the Bearcats' 1961 title game.\nThe extra period was described as \"a cautious game of cat-and-mouse\" by Mal Florence of the \"Los Angeles Times\". The opening tip of overtime was won by Rouse and controlled by Hunter. Harkness received a pass from Hunter and scored on a layup, giving the Ramblers the lead. Wilson responded with a basket for the Bearcats, before a long-distance shot by Miller restored a two-point lead for the Ramblers. Loyola later had an opportunity to extend their advantage, but missed a field goal attempt; after coming down with the rebound, Thacker made a long pass to Shingleton, and a resulting layup evened the score at 58–58. The game remained tied with under two minutes on the clock, as the Ramblers called a timeout with possession of the ball and subsequently went into a slow-paced offense themselves. Play was stopped with 1:21 remaining, as a jump ball was required to determine possession; Egan and Shingleton jumped against each other. Egan earned possession for Loyola, and the Ramblers held the ball to attempt the last shot of the overtime period. Harkness drove to the basket with about seven seconds on the clock, but elected to pass to Hunter, who attempted a shot. Hunter's effort bounced off the rim, but Rouse rebounded the ball and scored. One second was left on the clock. It expired before Cincinnati could inbound the ball, as the Ramblers won their first national championship in men's basketball, 60–58.\nStatistical summary.\nThe Ramblers won despite shooting around 27% from the field (23 of 84). Hunter led Loyola in scoring with 16 points. Rouse contributed 15 points; both Hunter and Rouse made six of 22 field goal attempts. In addition, Rouse led the Ramblers had 12 rebounds, one more than Hunter. Harkness scored 14 points on 5-of-18 shooting. All five starters for Loyola played the entire game without being substituted.\nCincinnati made 22 field goals in the game, but attempted only 45, 39 fewer than Loyola. Turnovers hindered the Bearcats; the Ramblers' defense forced 16 in the game, many more than Cincinnati typically had and 13 more than the Ramblers committed. Bonham led all scorers with 22 points, making half of his 16 shots. In the final 17 minutes, though, he did not attempt a field goal as the Bearcats went into their stall offense. Thacker added 13 points and a game-high 15 rebounds, while Wilson had 10 points and 13 rebounds. Among the Bearcats' starters, only Wilson was substituted.\nLegacy.\nIn 2013, author Tom Hager listed the 1963 NCAA championship game as the best ever played in the event. The game has received attention as the first national title contest to feature a majority of black starters; according to Ireland, an \"unspoken\" rule existed at the time that led to most teams starting only one or two African-Americans at most. However, over time the 1966 championship game, in which an all-African-American Texas Western team defeated an all-white Kentucky squad, became more widely recognized as a key moment in college basketball history. Regardless, Loyola's Miller later said that he believed the game was significant, as it encouraged college coaches to increase their recruiting efforts to black players. He said that the players of the 1963 title game \"helped a little, [and] maybe gave some people an opportunity that wasn't there prior to that.\"\nThe contest was broadcast on national television on Sports Network Incorporated. It was part of a six-year contract to televise the NCAA championship game annually. In national television ratings, it finished higher than episodes of the shows \"Gunsmoke\" and \"Have Gun – Will Travel\" that aired during the telecast. In the Ramblers' home market of Chicago, however, the game was broadcast on tape delay, after multiple other sporting events.\nThe Bearcats had a 17–9 record in the 1963–64 season, but did not play in the 1964 NCAA tournament. Cincinnati has participated in numerous NCAA Tournaments since 1963, but as of 2020 the program has not reached another national championship game. The team has advanced as far as the national semifinals only once, in 1992. Loyola began the 1963–64 season ranked first in the AP Poll and ended up winning 22 games. The Ramblers were again invited to the NCAA tournament, but their title defense ended in the regional semifinals. They appeared in two more NCAA tournaments in the 1960s, but never advanced past the first round. The Ramblers made it to the Sweet Sixteen in 1985. After a 33-year drought, Loyola reached the tournament in 2018, advancing to the Final Four for the first time since 1963. The 1962–63 Ramblers are the only NCAA Division I men's basketball champions from the state of Illinois."

        "text": "The PGA Championship is televised in the United States by CBS and ESPN. ESPN holds rights to early-round and weekend morning coverage and airs supplemental coverage through its digital subscription service ESPN+ during CBS's weekend broadcast windows. They started in 2020, replacing TNT. CBS holds rights to afternoon coverage of the weekend rounds. ABC had historically broadcast the tournament until 1991, when it moved to CBS.\nBroadcasters by territory.\nThe current broadcasters (correct as of 2019) of the PGA Championship are:\nCoverage overview.\nCBS (1958–1964; 1991–present).\nCBS has long-term deals for the PGA Championship (initially from 1958 to 1964 and again starting in 1991).\nFrank Chirkinian was known as the 'father of televised golf' for the impact he had on golf broadcasting. He came to the attention of CBS after he impressed with his direction of the 1958 PGA Championship. Recruited by the network, who had no one with expertise in the relatively new field of golf broadcasting, he went on to be executive producer of CBS's golf coverage from 1959 to 1996. During his time at CBS, he was nicknamed \"The Ayatollah\" for his brusque, uncompromising approach to directing broadcasts.\nABC (1965–1990).\nABC broadcast golf events for the first time in 1962 when it began televising the Open Championship as part of its anthology series \"Wide World of Sports\". The network later gained the broadcast rights to the PGA Championship in 1965, and the U.S. Open in 1966. Chris Schenkel and Byron Nelson were the initial hosts of the tournament coverage. In 1975, Jim McKay and Dave Marr became the lead broadcast team, while Bob Rosburg joined the network as the first ever on-course reporter, and Peter Alliss joined as a co-anchor.\nBeginning in 1982, ABC adopted its most well-known format of the \"Wide World of Sports\" era. The broadcast operated using anchor teams, in which an anchor and an analyst would call all of the action from the tower at the 18th hole, and the teams would be rotated on coverage after about a half-hour. Meanwhile, the three on-course reporters, which included Judy Rankin and Ed Sneed in addition to Rosburg, would be utilized when prompted by the anchor team. McKay and Marr would be the lead team, with Jack Whitaker and Alliss as the second team. Occasionally, Rosburg or Whitaker would host if McKay was unavailable, while Roger Twibell would take over the secondary team. After his 1986 Masters win, Jack Nicklaus would appear on ABC after the end of his round and served as an analyst for the rest of the telecast.\nIn 1990, Roger Twibell took over as lead anchor, with Dave Marr as his analyst. Peter Alliss became sole anchor of the second anchor team. During this period, ABC acquired the rights to several non-major PGA Tour events, mostly important events such as the Memorial Tournament and The Tour Championship. 1990 would also mark the final PGA Championship to be broadcast by ABC.\nESPN (1982−1990; 2020−present).\nIn 1982, ESPN provided the first cable television coverage of the PGA Championship with three hours on both Thursday and Friday. While there was no cable coverage of the first two rounds in 1984, ESPN returned for weekday coverage the following year and expanded to three and a half hours each day. And then in 1986, ESPN increased their weekday coverage to four hours.\nOn October 10, 2018, it was announced that ESPN had acquired cable rights to the tournament from 2020 to 2030. ESPN will, as with TNT, carry early-round and weekend morning coverage, but will also have the ability to offer supplemental coverage through its digital subscription service ESPN+ during CBS's weekend broadcast windows.\nTurner Sports (1991–2019).\nUntil ESPN regained the rights following the 2019 PGA Championship, TNT had the cable rights to the PGA Championship (with full coverage of the first two rounds and early coverage of the weekend rounds since 1999 after being on sister channel TBS since 1991) under a contract with the PGA of America that runs through 2019.\nWhen TBS took over the cable package for the PGA Championship in 1991, they increased the weekday coverage to 6 hours per day. TBS also added 2 hours of Saturday and Sunday coverage. Because inclement weather stopped play during the third round of 2012 PGA Championship on Saturday, TNT added coverage starting at 8a.m. ET on Sunday.\nFor the 1991 PGA Championship, Bob Neal and Bobby Clampett anchored the TBS coverage. TBS also used golf instructor David Leadbetter, former LPGA player Donna Caponi, and NFL analyst Pat Haden for the 1991 PGA Championship coverage. For the 1992 PGA Championship, TBS installed Leadbetter as its lead analyst. Gary Bender and MLB analyst Don Sutton were also part of the TBS crew.\nBeginning with the 1995 PGA Championship, Ernie Johnson Jr. became the primary golf anchor for Turner. During the 2006 PGA Championship, Verne Lundquist filled in on TNT for Johnson, who was undergoing chemotherapy. During TNT's Sunday coverage of the 2011 PGA Championship, Lundquist once again stepped in for Johnson after Johnson's father died. On both occasions, Lundquist was already on-site as a tower announcer for CBS's coverage.\nDave Marr served as the lead analyst for TBS during their 1995 PGA Championship coverage. By the 1996 PGA Championship, Bobby Clampett once again assumed the lead Turner analyst role. Also for the 1996 PGA Championship, former LPGA player Mary Bryan moved over from CBS to join the TBS team."

Tournament coverage of the first eight holes did not begin until 1995 because of resistance from the tournament organizers, but by 2007, more than 50 cameras were used. Chairman Jack Stephens felt that the back nine was always more \"compelling\", increased coverage would increase the need for sponsorship spending, and that broadcasting the front nine of the course on television would cut down on attendance and television viewership for the tournament. USA Network added first- and second-round coverage in 1982. The Masters has been broadcast every year in high-definition television since 2005, one of the first golf tournaments to hold that distinction. In 2008, ESPN replaced USA as broadcaster of early-round coverage. These broadcasts use the CBS Sports production staff and commentators, although then-ESPN personality Mike Tirico previously served as a studio host (replacing Bill Macatee's role under USA Network).\nCoverage overview.\nCBS (1956–present).\nAs previously mentioned, CBS has televised the Masters Tournament in the United States every year since 1956, when it used six cameras and covered only the final four holes. Because of resistance from the tournament organizers, 18 hole coverage did not begin until 2002 (coverage generally joining with the final group on the fifth or sixth hole all four days), but by 2006, over 50 cameras were used. USA Network added first- and second-round coverage in 1982, which was also produced by the CBS production team.\nThe previously independent USA Sports became part of NBC Sports through NBCUniversal in 2005, meaning the cable and network coverage of the Masters was split between rival companies. However, USA continued to use its own graphics for sports, and CBS continued to produce their coverage of the Masters, an arrangement that lasted through 2007. ESPN, another rival of CBS Sports, took over in 2008. However, ESPN uses CBS graphics and production with the CBS logo.\nIn 2007, CBS broadcast the tournament with high-definition fixed and handheld wired cameras, as well as standard-definition wireless handheld cameras. that same year, CBS also added \"Masters Extra,\" an hour's extra full-field bonus coverage daily on the internet, preceding the television broadcasts. In 2008, CBS added full coverage of holes 15 and 16 live on the web.\nWhile Augusta National Golf Club has consistently chosen CBS as its U.S. broadcast partner, it has done so on successive one-year contracts. Due to the lack of long-term contractual security, as well as the club's limited dependence on broadcast rights fees (owing to its affluent membership), it is widely held that CBS allows Augusta National greater control over the content of the broadcast, or at least perform some form of self-censorship, in order to maintain future rights. The club, however, has insisted it does not make any demands with respect to the content of the broadcast.\nThere are some controversial aspects to this relationship. Announcers refer to the gallery as \"patrons\" rather than spectators or fans (\"gallery\" itself is also used), and use the term \"second cut\" instead of \"rough\" (however, the second cut is normally substantially shorter than comparable \"primary rough\" at other courses). Announcers who have been deemed not to have acted with the decorum expected by the club have been removed, notably Jack Whitaker and analyst Gary McCord. Whitaker referred to the gallery at the end of the 18-hole Monday playoff in 1966 as a \"mob\" and missed five years (1967–1971); McCord last worked on the Masters telecast in 1994, being banned that summer after using the terms bikini wax and body bags in his descriptions. There also tends to be a lack of discussion of any controversy involving Augusta National, such as the 2003 Martha Burk protests. However, there have not been many other major issues in recent years.\nThe final round of the 1994 Masters was the final on-air assignment for Pat Summerall on CBS Sports. CBS had lost the rights to the National Football Conference to Fox (where Summerall and his broadcasting colleague, John Madden would soon move over to) prior to the 1994 NFL season. But much like Vin Scully did in 1982 after calling his final NFL game (the between the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys), Pat Summerall stayed at CBS a couple more months so he could make the 1994 Masters his final broadcast for CBS, where he was a mainstay for over 30 years.\nSummerall signed off the broadcast thus, surrounded by the other CBS commentators that were working the tournament:\nThe 2020 Masters Tournament was delayed until November due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Schedule changes were made because of sunset around 5:24 p.m. and legal end of civil twilight at 5:51 p.m. each day. To accommodate CBS's coverage of the NFL Week 10 games (and, additionally, ensure that play will conclude before sunset), the final round will be scheduled so that coverage can begin at 10:00 a.m. ET (similar to the 2019 Masters final round, which was moved up due to the threat of storms) and conclude around 2:30 p.m. ET. CBS was only assigned late-afternoon NFL games (4:05 p.m. ET starts) for that week. Furthermore, CBS's SEC football game, normally a 3:30 p.m. ET game, was assigned for a 6:00 p.m. ET kickoff so that it could air after the conclusion of third round coverage, which will end before sunset. However, the SEC game was postponed due to COVID-19 cases among one of the participating teams, leading to CBS scheduling only \"College Football Today\" after the conclusion of coverage, and giving the rest of the game's broadcast window back to affiliates and network programming.\nOn November 12, 2020, \"Sports Business Journal\" reported that the conclusion of the final round of the Masters on Sunday, November 15 could be broadcast on ABC, if weather or a playoff extended the action beyond 4 p.m., when CBS would transition to NFL coverage.\nUSA Network (1982–2007).\nThe USA Network began first and second round Masters coverage in 1982, which was also produced by the CBS production team. This was the first cable coverage for one of the golf majors. Initially, the USA Network provided Thursday and Friday coverage for 2 hours live each day along with a prime time replay. In 1995, USA expanded the Thursday/Friday coverage to 2.5 hours each day. In 2003 and 2004, both CBS and USA televised the Masters commercial-free. In 2005, USA increased the Thursday/Friday coverage to 3 hours.\nIn early 2006, it was announced that USA was outbid by Golf Channel for its early-round PGA Tour rights, with USA's final season being 2006. NBC/Universal, parent company of USA Network, traded away the network's Ryder Cup coverage through 2012 to ESPN for the rights to sign Al Michaels. However, USA did renew its Masters contract for one final year. USA would televise the 2007 Masters before being outbid by ESPN. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities.\nESPN (2008–present).\nESPN replaced USA in 2008 as the broadcaster for the early rounds. ESPN originally used Mike Tirico and Curtis Strange as their commentary team inside Butler Cabin. However, Mike Tirico left for NBC Sports in 2016 and was replaced by Scott Van Pelt. ESPN also used Tom Rinaldi for interviews until he left for Fox Sports in 2021.\nEarly round coverage of The Masters continues to be aired by ESPN, however, coverage is produced by CBS and uses CBS announcers and graphics (excluding Van Pelt, Strange, and Rinaldi).\nInternational coverage.\nThe BBC has broadcast the Masters in the UK since 1963, and it also provides live radio commentary on the closing stages on BBC Radio 5 Live. Coverage was also provided by ITV between 1979-1982 and Channel 4 between 1983 and 1985. BBC Sport held the exclusive TV and radio rights through to 2010. The BBC's coverage airs without commercials because it is financed by a licence fee.\nFrom the 2011 Masters, Sky Sports began broadcasting all four days, as well as the par 3 contest in HD and, for the first time, in 3D. The BBC will only have highlights of the first two days' play but will go head to head with Sky Sports, with full live coverage on the final two days of play. From 2020, live coverage moved to Sky on an exclusive basis, with the BBC showing highlights of each days play.\nIn Ireland, Setanta Ireland previously showed all four rounds, and from 2017 until closure in 2021, Eir Sport broadcast all four rounds live having previously broadcast the opening two rounds with RTÉ broadcasting the weekend coverage. Sky Sports now shows the whole event exclusively live in Ireland, like in the UK.\nIn Canada, broadcast rights to the Masters are held by Bell Media, with coverage divided between TSN (cable), which carries live simulcasts and primetime encores of CBS and ESPN coverage for all four rounds, CTV (broadcast), which simulcasts CBS's coverage of the weekend rounds, and RDS, which carries French-language coverage.\nIn Japan, Tokyo Broadcasting System Television is an only broadcaster since 1976.\nPrior to 2013, Canadian broadcast rights were held by a marketing company, Graham Sanborn Media, which in turn bought time on the Global Television Network, TSN, and RDS (except for 2012 when French-language coverage aired on TVA and TVA Sports) to air the broadcasts, also selling all of the advertising for the Canadian broadcasts. This was an unusual arrangement in Canadian sports broadcasting, as in most cases broadcasters acquire their rights directly from the event organizers or through partnerships with international rightsholders, such as ESPN International (ESPN owns a 20% minority stake in TSN).\nIn 2013, Global and TSN began selling advertising directly, and jointly produced their own preview and highlights shows for Canadian audiences (while still carrying ESPN/CBS coverage for the tournament itself).\nIn Australia, the tournament has been broadcast live on the Nine Network since 2018.\nIn Spain, Canal+ held the Masters rights since the 1990s up until July 2015, when they were transferred to Telefónica after the Spanish telecommunications company bought Canal+. Movistar+' premium golf channel Movistar Golf airs the par 3 contest on Wednesday and live tournament coverage for all four rounds. offers partial live coverage in simulcast with Movistar Golf as well as encore coverage shortly after the end of each round. In 2020 and for the first time, Movistar+ will have two separate live broadcasts of the Masters with Movistar Deportes airing live coverage of the Featured Groups, the Amen Corner and the 15th and 16th holes.\nIn France, the Masters is broadcast live on Canal+ and Canal+ Sport."

        "title": "List of Ryder Cup broadcasters",
        "text": "The Ryder Cup matches were always covered by the BBC, whether in Britain or in the United States, even prior to the British team's merger with Europe. In the 1990s, Sky Sports became heavily involved in the Ryder Cup, and has since taken over live coverage, including creating a channel specifically dedicated for the 2014 and 2016 competition. The BBC still screens edited highlights each night.\nUK television coverage.\nThe Ryder Cup was always covered on TV and radio by the BBC from 1927-1971. But in the 1970s, ITV gained the rights to cover the Ryder Cup on TV covering the 1973, 1975 and 1977 cups. ITV was also supposed to show the 1979 cup (the first with a European team) but were stopped from showing it due to the 1979 ITV strike. The BBC continued to cover it on radio.\nIn 1981, the BBC regained the TV rights after an eight year absence covering the 1981, 1983, 1985, 1987, 1989, 1991 and 1993 cups. But beginning in 1995, Sky Sports took over the rights for live coverage and has held them ever since.\nSky Sports created a dedicated channel for the competition beginning with the 2014 cup. It has created a dedicated channel for every cup since this is now a simple rebranding for Sky Sports Golf when the event takes place starting from the week before to the Monday after. But the BBC now has highlights on TV and is still doing live coverage on the radio having broadcast it on the radio since the first cup in 1927 but now has to share radio coverage with Talksport.\nUS television coverage overview.\nABC (1975–1987).\nIn the United States, the Ryder Cup was first televised live at the 1983 matches in Florida, with ABC Sports covering just the final four holes of the singles matches. A highlight package of the 1985 singles matches was produced by ESPN, but no live coverage aired from England. In 1987, with the matches back in the United States, ABC covered both weekend days, but only in the late afternoon. Also in 1987, ABC provided approximately 2½ hours of tournament coverage each on Saturday as well as Sunday. The network also previously covered the Sunday singles of the Ryder Cup in 1975 (with Jim McKay as the lead commentator) and 1979.\nESPN (1985–1987; 2006–2012).\nESPN revamped its graphics and its coverage team in 2010 as well. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger remained the lead booth announcers. Curtis Strange returned as a hole announcer, while Scott Van Pelt moved from the studio host position to become a hole announcer as well. Sean McDonough joined the coverage team as another hole announcer. Andy North, Judy Rankin and Billy Kratzert all returned as on-course reporters. Terry Gannon moved from a hole announcer role to the role of studio host during live coverage, for highlight updates. Tom Weiskopf, who had been a hole announcer, became an analyst for holes Van Pelt was assigned to, and was joined by Peter Alliss in this role for one hour per day at the Open Championship. At the Ryder Cup, Alliss took Van Pelt's place as a hole announcer, while Van Pelt and Weiskopf worked on the studio set. Tom Rinaldi remained the lead interviewer and essayist.\nIn 2012, Gannon's role was eliminated and he joined NBC Sports and the Golf Channel.\n2012 would also be ESPN's final Ryder Cup. The network traded its Friday rights to the 2014 event back to NBC for additional Premier League highlights. NBC then signed a rights deal covering the 2016–2030 editions of the event, ending ESPN's chances of a comeback.\nUSA Network (1989–2010).\nIn 1989, USA Network began a long association with the Ryder Cup, by televising all three days live from England, the first live coverage of a Ryder Cup from Europe. This led to a one-year deal for the 1991 matches in South Carolina to be carried by NBC live on the weekend, with USA Network continuing to provide live coverage of the first day. All five sessions were broadcast for the first time. The success of the 1991 matches led to a contract extension with USA and NBC through 1997, marking a turning point in the competition's popularity. For the European matches, the first two days were taped and aired on delay in the U.S. Another extension with USA and NBC covering the 1999–2003 (later moved to 2004) competitions increased the number of hours of coverage to include the entire first day and most of the second day. Tape delay was still employed for competitions from Europe.\nIn early 2006, it was announced that USA was outbid by Golf Channel for its early-round PGA Tour rights, with USA's final season being 2006. NBC/Universal, parent company of USA Network, traded away the network's Friday Ryder Cup coverage through 2012 to ESPN for the rights to sign Al Michaels. However, USA did renew its Masters contract for an additional year. USA would televise the 2007 Masters before being outbid by ESPN for future coverage. The 2007 Masters was also the final event for USA Sports, which was dissolved into parent NBC Sports after the tournament. All future sports telecasts on USA would use NBC's graphics and personalities.\nThe Ryder Cup contract, which stipulated cable coverage air on USA, was still controlled by NBC even after it granted ESPN the rights to Friday cable coverage (normally the only day of the event covered on cable). However, in 2010, rain on Friday pushed the singles matches to Monday, necessitating that they air on cable. With NBC having granted only Friday rights to ESPN, the singles matches aired on USA, which would be the final golf telecast for the network. Four months later, NBC merged with Golf Channel, making Golf Channel NBC's primary cable outlet for golf.\nNBC (1991–present).\n1993 was first the Ryder Cup played in Europe to be televised live in the United States by a major network, NBC. The 1989 edition was carried by the USA Network on cable, with video provided by the BBC.\nThe U.S. television coverage in 1985 was a highlight show on ESPN in early November, over a month after its completion. NBC took over live weekend coverage in 1991 in South Carolina.\nThe Ryder Cup's increased success led to a landmark contract with NBC (which had recently bought USA Network) to air the 2006–2014 competitions on USA and NBC. It called for a record increase in coverage hours, with the second day now having near-complete coverage. Tape delay was last used for the 2006 event in Ireland. In 2006, ESPN was sub-licensed rights to Friday coverage, as part of a larger transaction between NBC and Disney that also resulted in ABC Sports personality Al Michaels moving to NBC to join their then-upcoming Sunday-night NFL games, ESPN gaining expanded access to highlights from events whose rights are owned by NBC, and Disney acquiring the rights to the cartoon character Oswald the Lucky Rabbit (who was created by Walt Disney in 1927 for a series of animated shorts distributed by Universal Pictures).\nIn 2013, NBC reached a deal to extend its rights to the Ryder Cup and Senior PGA Championship through 2030, with Friday coverage of the Ryder Cup being assumed by Golf Channel.\nThe 2016 Ryder Cup was televised in the United States by Golf Channel and NBC, which planned to provide 170 hours of coverage. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the event was broadcast by Sky Sports; the broadcaster re-branded its Sky Sports 4 channel as Sky Sports Ryder Cup for the week of the event, and planned to broadcast 240 hours of coverage.\nUS television commentators.\nPlay-by-play/anchors.\nThe 33rd Ryder Cup Matches were covered live in the United States for all five sessions. USA Network covered the Friday action, with Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis in the 18th tower. The weekend was covered live by NBC Sports, with Dick Enberg and Johnny Miller in the 18th tower, Dan Hicks calling holes, and on-course reporters Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and John Schroeder. Jim Gray conducted interviews, and on the final day was also used as a fifth on-course reporter. On the weekend, former European Ryder Cup captain Bernard Gallacher was brought in as a guest analyst to provide a European perspective. In the UK, BBC and Sky Sports both had a presence, with Peter Alliss and Ewen Murray being the lead broadcaster for each.\nIn the United States, coverage of 2002's first day was presented on tape-delay by USA Network, but was recorded live. Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis hosted from the 18th tower. On the weekend, NBC Sports presented Saturday's coverage on tape, but recorded live. NBC aired the singles live on Sunday. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, Bob Murphy called holes, while on-course reporters were Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Ed Sneed. To provide a European perspective, NBC used former European team captain Bernard Gallacher and former European team player Nick Faldo as guest analysts. Gallacher had performed the same role for NBC at the previous Ryder Cup.\nIn the United States, live Friday 2004 coverage was provided by USA Network. Bill Macatee and Peter Kostis hosted from the 18th tower. NBC Sports presented live coverage of the Saturday and Sunday matches. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, Bob Murphy called holes, while on-course reporters were Gary Koch, Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Ed Sneed.\nIn the United States, coverage of 2006's first day was recorded live, but presented on tape-delay by USA Network. Bill Macatee hosted from the 18th tower. On Saturday, NBC Sports presented coverage on tape, but recorded live. NBC then aired the singles live on Sunday morning. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, Gary Koch and Bob Murphy called holes, while on-course reporters were Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper. To provide a European perspective, NBC used former European team player Nick Faldo as a guest analyst on the Saturday afternoon session. Faldo had worked in the same role for NBC at the 2002 Ryder Cup, and at the time of the 2006 edition was in between jobs, having worked as an analyst for ABC Sports from 2004-2006,but having signed with CBS Sports for 2007 and beyond.\nAll 2008 matches were covered live in the United States. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Andy North hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange calling holes, and on-course reporters Billy Kratzert and Judy Rankin. With Azinger, ESPN's lead analyst, captaining the U.S. team, North was moved to the booth to fill Azinger's seat. NBC Sports covered the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch and Bob Murphy calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper.\nAll 2010 matches were covered live in the United States, a first for a Ryder Cup in Europe. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange, Peter Alliss, and Sean McDonough calling holes, and on-course reporters Andy North, Billy Kratzert and Judy Rankin. Scott Van Pelt and Tom Weiskopf handled recaps during coverage. Most of ESPN's coverage was rained out on Friday, with a 7-hour rain delay during the middle of the day. NBC Sports covered the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper. USA Network aired coverage of the singles live on Monday morning. The coverage was produced by corporate sibling NBC, with NBC's announcers being used on the telecast.\nAll 2012 matches were covered live in the United States. ESPN handled Friday coverage. Mike Tirico and Paul Azinger hosted from the 18th tower, with Curtis Strange and Sean McDonough calling holes, and on-course reporters Andy North and Billy Kratzert. Scott Van Pelt hosted recaps during coverage. On Saturday, Golf Channel covered the first half-hour of the morning matches with Kelly Tilghman, Brandel Chamblee and Nick Faldo. NBC covered the remainder of the weekend action, with Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosting from the 18th tower, Gary Koch and Peter Jacobsen calling holes, and on-course reporters Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie, and Dottie Pepper. To bring a European perspective to the telecasts, former European Ryder Cup player Colin Montgomerie was utilized as a guest analyst by NBC on Saturday. NBC had previously used guest analysts for the Ryder Cup in 1999, 2002, and 2006.\nIn the US, corporate siblings Golf Channel and NBC televised the 2014 event live, after NBC had traded for complete rights (that it was contractually given the rights to in 2005) back from ESPN, who had televised the previous three Ryder Cups on Friday. Golf Channel televised action on Friday and a half-hour on Saturday, from where NBC took over for the rest of the weekend. In the early-morning sessions, Terry Gannon hosted from the 18th tower alongside Frank Nobilo. Curt Byrum and Tom Abbott served as hole announcers and Jerry Foltz was an on-course commentator. Nick Faldo appeared as a guest commentator on Friday, and sparked controversy after critical comments about Sergio García. For the afternoon sessions and the singles matches on Sunday, the regular NBC golf crew provided coverage. Dan Hicks and Johnny Miller hosted from the 18th tower, with Gary Koch and Peter Jacobsen as hole announcers. On course commentators were Mark Rolfing, Roger Maltbie and Notah Begay III. On the weekend, Colin Montgomerie appeared as a guest commentator to lend a European perspective, a role he previously filled for NBC in 2012."

        "text": "The 2018 PGA Championship was the 100th PGA Championship, held August 9–12 at Bellerive Country Club in Town and Country, Missouri, a suburb west of St. Louis. This was the second PGA Championship (1992) and third major (1965 U.S. Open) held at Bellerive. It was also scheduled to be the last held in the month of August (although the 2020 tournament would later be moved to August due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Just before the 2017 tournament, the PGA announced that the Championship would move to May in 2019.\nBrooks Koepka won his third career major title, finishing two strokes ahead of runner-up Tiger Woods.

The event was first founded in 2010 as \"Rip Curl Pro Portugal\". \nThe defending men's champion is the Californian surfer Griffin Colapinto who won the event in 2022 after the break due to the COVID-19 outbreak.

The Round 5 of the event was done there, then the conditions on Supertubos came back, and the competition returned to its normality.\nIn August 2018, it was announced by the WSL that Peniche will receive once again the women's competition after nine years without it, which they lost to Cascais. Peniche will host both the men's and women's competition.\nNaming.\nSince the birth of this competition it had four different titles due to sponsor deals.\nWinners.\nThe MEO Rip Curl Pro Portugal event gives birth to a new champion each and every year.

        "text": "Ronnie Silas Dawson Jr. (born May 19, 1995) is an American professional baseball outfielder for the Kiwoom Heroes of the KBO League. The Houston Astros selected him with the 62nd overall selection of the 2016 MLB draft. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Astros and Cincinnati Reds.\nAmateur career.\nDawson attended Licking Heights High School in Pataskala, Ohio, where he played baseball and football. He focused on football until his junior year, when he tore his anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee. He had knee surgery before his senior year, and missed the football season. He returned to the baseball team as a senior, in 2013, and had a .576 batting average. \"The Columbus Dispatch\" named Dawson their All-Metro Team Player of the Year. He attended Ohio State University, and played college baseball for the Ohio State Buckeyes. He also played collegiate summer baseball for the Chillicothe Paints of the Prospect League. In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League, and was named a league all-star.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Astros.\nThe Houston Astros selected Dawson in the second round, with the 61st overall selection, of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft. He signed with the Astros, receiving a $1,056,800 signing bonus, and the Astros assigned him to the Tri-City ValleyCats of the Low–A New York-Penn League, where he spent all of 2016, batting .225 with seven home runs and 36 RBIs. In 2017, he played for the Quad Cities River Bandits of the Single–A Midwest League and the Buies Creek Astros of the High–A Carolina League, posting a combined .278 batting average with 14 home runs, 67 RBIs, and an .800 OPS. He began the 2018 season with Buies Creek, and was promoted to the Corpus Christi Hooks of the Double–A Texas League during the season.\nThe Astros invited Dawson to spring training as a non-roster player in 2019. After splitting the 2019 season between Corpus Christi and the Triple-A Round Rock Express, Dawson did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the 2020 Minor League Baseball season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn April 14, 2021, the Astros promoted Dawson to the majors for the first time. He made his major league debut that day as the Astros’ designated hitter against the Detroit Tigers and recorded his first major league hit, a single off of Alex Lange. On April 20, Dawson was removed from the 40-man roster. In his brief stint, Dawson appeared in three games, recording one hit in six plate appearances.\nCincinnati Reds.\nOn December 8, 2021, the Cincinnati Reds selected Dawson from the Astros organization in the minor league phase of the Rule 5 draft. He was assigned to the Triple-A Louisville Bats to begin the 2022 season.\nOn May 4, 2022, Dawson was selected to the 40-man and active rosters after Tyler Naquin and Nick Senzel were placed on the COVID-19 injured list. In his season debut the next day, Dawson went 0-for-3 with two strikeouts in a 10–5 loss against the Milwaukee Brewers. He was returned to Triple-A Louisville a day later. Dawson was again selected to the active roster on May 9 after Mike Moustakas was placed on the COVID injured list. He was again returned to Louisville the next day, this time without making an appearance.\nSpending the remainder of the season with the Bats, Dawson appeared in 116 games, slashing .252/.339/.394 with 11 home runs, 43 RBI, and 11 stolen bases.

In 57 games for Kiwoom, he hit .336/.399/.454 with 3 home runs, 29 RBI, and 9 stolen bases.\nOn December 11, 2023, Dawson re-signed with the Heroes on a one-year contract for the 2024 season.\nPersonal life.\nAs a child, Dawson served as a batboy for the Columbus Clippers of the Triple-A International League."

        "text": "Matthew Barham Luke (born October 29, 1976) is an American football coach and former player who is currently the offensive line coach at Clemson University. \nLuke previously served as the assistant head coach and offensive line coach at the University of Georgia. Luke was also the head coach at the University of Mississippi, amassing a 15–21 record from 2017 to 2019.\nPlaying career.\nLuke was born in Gulfport, Mississippi. He was a standout at Gulfport High School, but he was a walk-on at Ole Miss, where scholarships were limited because of NCAA sanctions. He played center there from 1995 to 1998, graduating in 2000. His father, Tommy Luke, played defensive back at Ole Miss in the 1960s while his older brother, Tom Luke, played quarterback there from 1989 to 1991. As a senior, he played in the 1998 Independence Bowl against Texas Tech.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coach.\nLuke exhausted his eligibility after the 1999 season but joined the coaching staff as a graduate assistant. After graduating from Ole Miss in 2000 with a Bachelor of Business Administration, he took a job with Murray State University as an offensive line coach. Following the 2001 season, he returned to Ole Miss to coach offensive line and tight ends under head coach David Cutcliffe. Ole Miss fired Cutcliffe after the 2004 season, but new head coach Ed Orgeron retained Luke as part of his staff. \nLuke departed Ole Miss in 2006 to be reunited with Cutcliffe at the University of Tennessee, where Cutcliffe was the assistant head coach and offensive coordinator under head coach Phillip Fulmer. Luke coached the offensive line and tight ends at Tennessee for two seasons (2006–2007). \nIn early 2008, Duke University hired Cutcliffe as its new head coach, and Cutcliffe brought several Tennessee assistants with him, including Luke. At Duke, Luke was co-offensive coordinator with responsibility for the running game, while also coaching the offensive line. Luke departed Duke at the end of the 2011 season to rejoin the Ole Miss coaching staff under new head coach Hugh Freeze. At Ole Miss, he had a similar role: co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach.\nHead coach.\nOn July 20, 2017, Luke became the interim head coach at Ole Miss after Freeze was forced to resign. After a late season push to finish 6–6, Ole Miss removed the interim tag on November 26, 2017 and named Luke the 37th head football coach in school history. Ole Miss did not play in a bowl game; it had withdrawn from bowl consideration in response to NCAA rules violations committed when Freeze was head coach. The school and NCAA also imposed additional penalties, including a second post-season ban for the 2018 season (which also allowed athletes near the end of their eligibility to transfer without penalty); three years of NCAA probation; reductions in scholarships; and recruiting restrictions.\nOle Miss finished with losing records in the next two seasons, resulting in Luke's firing on December 1, 2019.\nGeorgia.\nOn December 10, 2019, Luke joined the Georgia football staff as an offensive line coach and associate head coach. He helped guide the 2021 Georgia Bulldogs football team to the national championship. On February 21, 2022, he stepped down from his position, citing a need to spend more time with his family."

        "text": "As of 2020, NBC Sports is the official broadcaster of the U.S. Open, as the result of a 8–year deal with the USGA for exclusive rights to its tournaments through 2027. Coverage is telecast by NBC (over-the-air) and USA Network (cable). Coverage was previously televised by NBC and ESPN through 2014. NBC's most recent period as rights holder began in 1995; ABC held the broadcast rights from 1966 through 1994. Fox held the broadcast rights from 2015 to 2019.\nCoverage overview.\nAmerican coverage.\nFirst NBC era (1954–1965).\nNBC first began televising golf events after it was awarded the television rights to the U.S. Open in 1954. The tournament continued to air on the network through the 1965 event, however NBC rebuffed a long-term deal to broadcast the event when the United States Golf Association (USGA) decided on a true contract in 1966. The network, however, did televise a handful of PGA Tour events over the following decades.\nABC era (1966–1994).\nABC broadcast golf events for the first time in 1962 when it began televising the Open Championship as part of its anthology series \"Wide World of Sports\". The network later gained the broadcast rights to the PGA Championship in 1965, and the U.S. Open in 1966. Chris Schenkel and Byron Nelson were the initial hosts of the tournament coverage. In 1975, Jim McKay and Dave Marr became the lead broadcast team, while Bob Rosburg joined the network as the first ever on-course reporter, and Peter Alliss joined as a co-anchor.\nBeginning in 1982, ABC adopted its most well-known format of the \"Wide World of Sports\" era. The broadcast operated using anchor teams, in which an anchor and an analyst would call all of the action from the tower at the 18th hole, and the teams would be rotated on coverage after about a half-hour. Meanwhile, the three on-course reporters, which included Judy Rankin and Ed Sneed in addition to Rosburg, would be utilized when prompted by the anchor team. McKay and Marr would be the lead team, with Jack Whitaker and Alliss as the second team. Occasionally, Rosburg or Whitaker would host if McKay was unavailable, while Roger Twibell would take over the secondary team. After his 1986 Masters win, Jack Nicklaus would appear on ABC after the end of his round and served as an analyst for the rest of the telecast.\nIn 1990, Roger Twibell took over as lead anchor, with Dave Marr as his analyst. Peter Alliss became sole anchor of the second anchor team. During this period, ABC acquired the rights to several non-major PGA Tour events, mostly important events such as the Memorial Tournament and The Tour Championship. 1990 would also mark the final PGA Championship to be broadcast by ABC.\nIn 1992, Brent Musburger, who had been heavily criticized for his hosting of golf coverage while with CBS, took over as host. Marr was dismissed from the network, while Twibell was reassigned to ESPN's golf coverage, although he occasionally hosted on ABC for a few lower-level tournaments. The format was also reorganized to more emphasize the on-course reporters. Steve Melnyk moved over from CBS to become lead analyst; however, Alliss would anchor for stretches during the telecast. Beyond the team in the booth, all of ABC's other voices were on the course, including Rankin, Rosburg, and newcomer Mark Rolfing.\nIn 1993, ABC used Peter Jacobsen as a lead analyst; however, Jacobsen returned to playing in 1994 and Melnyk returned to the lead analyst position. ABC continued to hold the television rights to select PGA Tour events, with the schedule increasing slightly as a result of a new television deal with the PGA Tour in 1995, however it still mostly emphasized only the important tournament events. The network lost the rights to the U.S. Open following an ugly split from the United States Golf Association (USGA) in 1994. Nicklaus held his position of entering the booth during the major championship telecasts through the period from 1992 to 1996.\nSecond NBC era (1995–2014).\nIn 1995, NBC Sports acquired rights to the USGA championships, including the U.S. Open, from ESPN/ABC. ESPN retained rights to a portion of the weekday coverage, however, NBC was the dominant rights holder, including exclusive coverage of the weekend rounds. This took NBC's coverage to a new level and marked the first time in the modern era of television that the network had televised a major championship. NBC, the Yanni composed theme music, \"In Celebration of Man\", and its lead analyst Johnny Miller (who joined NBC in 1990) became synonymous with the U.S. Open, televising it for the next 20 years, through 2014.\nFox era (2015–2019).\nOn August 6, 2013, Fox Sports announced a 12-year deal to broadcast the three open championships of the USGA: the U.S. Open, Women's Open, and Senior Open, beginning in 2015. Fox succeeded the USGA's long-term relationships with NBC Sports and ESPN. Fox, which had televised just one PGA Tour sanctioned event in its history (the unofficial CVS Charity Classic in 2011), paid $1 billion for full rights to all USGA championships.\nThe Fox network airs the final two days of the U.S. Open, Women's Open, Senior Open, and Amateur, as well as late coverage of the first two days of the U.S. Open. The rest of the coverage airs on Fox Sports 1. Also, the final two days of the U.S. Open air on Spanish-language channel Fox Deportes.\nOn April 23, 2014, Fox Sports announced that Greg Norman would join Joe Buck as its lead golf commentary team. Buck and Norman worked together for the first time at the 2014 U.S. Open, where Fox produced studio programming that aired against ESPN and NBC's studio shows.\nOn November 18, 2014, in advance of its coverage of the Franklin Templeton Shootout, Fox announced the full layout of its golf team.\nIn January 2016, Greg Norman was let go by Fox in response to poor reception towards his performance during the U.S. Open and was replaced by former ESPN analyst Paul Azinger. The network's 2016 U.S. Open team:\nThe network's 2016 U.S. Open team:\nIn 2017, Fox made several changes to the commentator team:\nFor the 2018 U.S. Open, Fox announced that they would be splitting their lead commentary booths into two teams. This was done in an effort to avoid the occasional logjam caused by a three-man booth, which had been Joe Buck with analysts Paul Azinger and Brad Faxon. Therefore, Azinger would now be paired with Buck, and Faxon would be paired alongside Shane Bacon.\nOn June 29, 2020, it was confirmed Fox had withdrawn from their 12-year deal with the USGA, and that NBCUniversal had taken over the remainder of the contract through to 2026.\nThird NBC era (2020–2026).\nHaving reacquired broadcasting rights to USGA championships, NBC was set to air the rescheduled 2020 U.S. Open in September; the tournament had originally been scheduled for June before being postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nInternational coverage.\nIn Australia, from 2015 Fox Sports Australia is the exclusive broadcaster of the U.S. Open until 2018.\nIn the United Kingdom, Sky Sports is the exclusive broadcaster for the U.S. Open.\nIn the past, ITV held the rights from the late 1970s/to 1983. From 1984-85, the event was shown on Channel 4. The BBC took over from 1986-1993."

It took place between 22 and 29 September 2019 in the historic county of Yorkshire, United Kingdom, the fourth to be held in the United Kingdom. The championships are traditionally hosted by a single town or city but, while each event in 2019 finished in the North Yorkshire town of Harrogate, the whole historic county of Yorkshire was the official host. Heavy rainfall caused some of the events to be re-routed and delayed.\nMen and women were split into the categories of elite, under-23 (only men) and junior, competing individually in the two traditional road race and time trial disciplines of road bicycle racing. The 2019 championships saw the introduction of the mixed team relay, a team time trial which was raced together by the elite men and women.

Italy's Matteo Trentin started the sprint but took silver while Stefan Küng of Switzerland took bronze. One of the favourites, Mathieu van der Poel of the Netherlands, had also been in the breakaway but could not follow it on the last lap and finished over ten minutes behind. The day was marred by atrocious, torrential, downpours and bitterly cold, windy weather. This left four men where Italy's Gianni Moscon later lost contact; he finished in fourth place but was unable to help his teammate Trentin. Three-time champion Peter Sagan of Slovakia made a late breakaway from a larger chase group but could not catch the leaders and came fifth, followed by Michael Valgren of Denmark.\nElite women's road race.\nDutch cyclist Annemiek van Vleuten won the race, after a solo breakaway for more than .

The inaugural event was won by one of the favourites, the Dutch team, with the female trio of Lucinda Brand, Riejanne Markus, Amy Pieters, and the male triumvirate Koen Bouwman, Bauke Mollema and Jos van Emden. Germany and the host Great Britain took silver and bronze, 23 seconds and 51 seconds behind.\nUnder-23 events.\nAs usual, there were only under-23 events for men. In the road race, Nils Eekhoff of the Netherlands won the sprint in a seven-man group but was later disqualified for drafting behind his team car for too long after a crash. The gold then went to Italy's Samuele Battistella. Stefan Bissegger of Switzerland was elevated to silver and Tom Pidcock got into the podium with a bronze for the British hosts.\nThe Danish favourite Mikkel Bjerg won his third consecutive gold in the under-23 time trial. The Americans Ian Garrison and Brandon McNulty took silver and bronze one second apart, but 27 seconds behind Bjerg who started as the last rider.\nJunior events.\nBoth junior road races were won by Americans. Quinn Simmons finished solo in the men's race while Megan Jastrab won a sprint for women. The victories contributed to the United States winning the most golds in the 2019 championships, three in total.\nAntonio Tiberi of Italy won the junior time trial for men by 8 seconds. Russia's Aigul Gareeva won for women by four seconds.\nLegacy.\nThe legacy of the Worlds event has been reported with £15 million worth of funding to go towards the construction of 27 off-road racing venues around the country, \"to ensure that every part of Britain has close access to a closed road circuit, velodrome, BMX track or mountain bike trail\".\nExternal links.\n "
