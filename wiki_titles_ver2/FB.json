        "title": "Horse racing in the United States",
        "text": "Horse racing in the United States dates back to 1665, which saw the establishment of the Newmarket course in Salisbury, New York, a section of what is now known as the Hempstead Plains of Long Island, New York. This first racing meet in North America was supervised by New York's colonial governor, Richard Nicolls. The area is now occupied by the present Nassau County, New York, region of Greater Westbury and East Garden City.\nHorse racing remains a popular sport throughout the United States.\nThoroughbred racing.\nThe American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States.\nHorse racing, especially thoroughbred racing, was a sport enjoyed by all during the progressive era. According to Steven A. Reiss \" Thoroughbred racing was the rare sport that was trending with both social and economic elites and the lower classes\". Horse racing was an enamored sport that was popular for its time in all regions of the United States and took a downturn for a while as the economy, gambling reformers and some interest faded. Reiss states that post-Civil War America was the rebirth of the horse racing sport and it relied on the status of men who bred and raced horses and operated jockey clubs and racetracks. \"The powerful alliance between urban machine politicians and racetrack owners enabled thoroughbred racing in New York to flourish for about for forty-five years without interruption\". Horse racing endured several ups and downs throughout the era to include socioeconomic status, political gain, morality imposition or just a mere stronghold for the pleasure of the sport.\nHistory.\nThere were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed. The anti-gambling sentiment prevalent in the early 20th century led almost all states to ban bookmaking. Bookmaking is the process of taking bets, calculating odds, and paying out winnings. This nearly eliminated horse racing altogether. When parimutuel betting was introduced in 1908, the racing industry turned around. Horse racing flourished until World War II. The sport did not regain popularity in the United States until horses began to win the Triple Crown, a series of three races, consisting of the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness Stakes, and the Belmont Stakes.\nEndurance racing.\nContemporary organized Endurance racing began in California around 1955, and the first race marked the beginning of the Tevis Cup This race was a one-hundred-mile, one-day-long ride starting in Squaw Valley, Placer County, and ending in Auburn. Founded in 1972, the American Endurance Ride Conference was the United States' first national endurance riding association.\nQuarter horse racing.\nThe first record of quarter mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County, Virginia. Each race consisted of only two horses and they raced down the village streets and lanes.\nThe Quarter Horse received its name due to the length of the race. The races were indeed \"a quarter\" of a mile, or 400 meters.\nIn 1940, Rillito Park Race track was built on the grounds of the Rukin Jelks stud farm in the heart of Tucson, Arizona and has long been recognized as the birthplace of Quarter Horse racing. The initial track consisted of a 3/8th mile straightaway, which later became the model for the “chute system” used in modern-day quarter horse racing. In 1954, Rillito added a 5/8ths mile oval and has since been the southern Arizona home of Thoroughbred and Quarter Horse racing. In 2012, Rillito Park Race Track was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\nMajor racetracks.\nThe Washington Jockey Club was founded in 1797 by John Tayloe III of The Octagon House and Charles Carnan Ridgely of Hampton. Its first racecourse was 4 blocks from the Whitehouse, it extended from 17th and 20th Streets and extending across Pennsylvania Avenue into Lafayette Park, now the site of Decatur House at H Street and Jackson Place, crossing Seventeenth Street and Pennsylvania Avenue to Twentieth Street, today's Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The course was relocated in 1802 to the Holmead Farm two miles north of the Executive Mansion, to what is now Meridian Hill.\nBelmont Park is part of the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred race course in the world, and it has the sport's largest grandstand.\nOne of the latest major horse track opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It first commenced Thoroughbred racing in 1977, but, since 1976, it is primarily a harness racing venue. The racetrack gave birth to what is now called the Monmouth Cup Stakes, now currently held at Monmouth Park, in 1977.\nOther more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup series of races in 2004.\nThe Thoroughbred horse racing in the United States Hall of Fame is in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\nIn North America, most racehorses are stabled in the backstretch of the racetrack at which their trainers are based. The backstretch has extensive facilities to house the horses and workers.\nTypes of racing.\nIn the United States, Thoroughbred flat races are run on either dirt, synthetic or turf surfaces. Other tracks offer Quarter Horse racing and Standardbred horse racing, or combinations of these three types of racing surfaces. Racing with other breeds, such as Arabian horse racing, is found on a limited basis. American Thoroughbred races are run at a wide variety of distances, most commonly from . The shorter distances are more common but the mid-to-long-distance races tend to be higher in prestige. With this in mind, breeders of Thoroughbred race horses attempt to breed horses that excel at a particular distance (see Dosage Index).\nThe Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack at the Alameda County Fairgrounds is the oldest horse racing track in America, dating back to 1858, when it was founded by the sons of the Spaniard Don Agustin Bernal.\nFlat racing.\nIn 1665, the first racetrack was constructed on Long Island. It is the oldest Thoroughbred race in North America. The American Stud Book was started in 1868, prompting the beginning of organized horse racing in the United States. There were 314 tracks operating in the United States by 1890; and in 1894, the American Jockey Club was formed.\nThe first record of quarter mile length races dated back to 1674 in Henrico County, Virginia. Each race consisted of only two horses and they raced down the village streets and lanes. The Quarter Horse received its name due to the length of the race. The races were indeed \"a quarter\" of a mile, or 400 meters. The breed of horse was developed so they could get off to a quick start, and win the race.\nBelmont Park is part of the western edge of the Hempstead Plains. Its mile-and-a-half main track is the largest dirt Thoroughbred race course in the world, and it has the sport's largest grandstand.\nOne of the latest major horse track opened in the United States was the Meadowlands Racetrack opened in 1977 for Thoroughbred racing. It is the home of the Meadowlands Cup. Other more recently opened tracks include Remington Park, Oklahoma City, opened in 1988, and Lone Star Park in the Dallas–Fort Worth Metroplex, opened in 1997; the latter track hosted the prestigious Breeders' Cup series of races in 2004.\nThoroughbred horse racing in the United States has its own Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York. The Hall of Fame honors remarkable horses, jockeys, owners, and trainers.\nEndurance racing.\nThe length of an endurance race varies greatly. Some are very short, only ten miles, while others can be up to one hundred miles. There are a few races that are even longer than one hundred miles and last multiple days. These different lengths of races are divided into five categories: pleasure rides (10–20 miles), non-competitive trail rides (21–27 miles), competitive trail rides (20–45 miles), progressive trail rides (25–60 miles), and endurance rides (40–100 miles in one day, up to in multiple days). Because each race is very long, trails of natural terrain are generally used.\nThe longest endurance race in the world is the Mongol Derby, which is 620 miles (1000 km) long.\nArabian horse.\nThe Arabian horse was developed by the Bedouin people of the Middle East specifically for stamina over long distances, so they could outrun their enemies. It was not until 1725 that the Arabian was introduced into the United States. Arabians appeared in the United States in colonial times, though were not bred as purebreds until about the time of the Civil War. Until the formation of the Arabian Horse Registry of America in 1908, Arabians were recorded with the Jockey Club in a separate subsection from Thoroughbreds.\nThey must be able to withstand traveling long distances at a moderate pace. Arabians have an abundance of Type I fibers. Their muscles are able to work for extended periods of time. Also, the muscles of the Arabian are not nearly as massive as those of the Quarter Horse, which allow it to travel longer distances at quicker speeds. The Arabian is primarily used today in endurance racing, but is also raced over traditional race tracks in many countries.\nArabian Horse Racing is governed by IFAHR (The International Federation of Arabian Horse Racing Authorities).\nQuarter horse.\nThe ancestors of the Quarter Horse were prevalent in America in the early 17th century. These horses were a blend of Colonial Spanish horses crossed English horses that were brought over in the 1700s. The native horse and the English horse were bred together, resulting in a compact muscular horse. At this time, they were mainly used for chores such as plowing and cattle work. The American Quarter Horse was not recognized as an official breed until the formation of the American Quarter Horse Association in 1940.\nIn order to be successful in racing, Quarter Horses need to be able to propel themselves forward at extremely fast sprinter speed. The Quarter Horse has much larger hind limb muscles than the Arabian, which make it much less suitable for endurance racing. They also have more Type II-b fibers, which allow the Quarter Horse to accelerate rapidly.\nWhen Quarter Horse racing began, it was very expensive to lay a full mile of track so it was agreed that a straight track of four hundred meters, or one quarter of a mile would be laid instead. It became the standard racing distance for Quarter Horses and inspired their name. With the exception of the longer, distance contests, Quarter Horse races are run flat out, with the horses running at top speed for the duration. There is less jockeying for position, as turns are rare, and many races end with several contestants grouped together at the wire. The track surface is similar to that of Thoroughbred racing and usually consists of dirt.\nImportant races.\nThe traditional high point of US horse racing is the Kentucky Derby, held on the first Saturday of May at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. Together, the Derby; the Preakness Stakes, held two weeks later at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland; and the Belmont Stakes, held three weeks after the Preakness at Belmont Park on Long Island, form the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing for three-year-olds. They are all held early in the year, throughout May and the beginning of June.\nThe Breeders' Cup event is held in late October or early November at different race tracks every year. It receives less attention than the Triple Crown series from the general public but is of great importance in determining the American Horse of the Year and annual Eclipse Award divisional winners. It is normally held at a different track every year, though some racetracks have held back-to-back renewals. It currently consists of thirteen races held over two days with total prize-money of $28 million, with the Breeders' Cup Classic being the most prestigious.\nThe richest horse race in the United States is the Pegasus World Cup, held in late January at Gulfstream Park in Florida since 2017.\nThere are also a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Pacers and a Triple Crown of Harness Racing for Trotters, as well as an Arabian Triple Crown consisting of Drinkers of the Wind Derby in California, the Texas Six Shooter Stakes, the Bob Magness Derby in Delaware. Also, the main Standardbred event is the Breeders Crown.\nThoroughbred and Arabian fillies have their own \"Triple\" series, commonly referred to as The Triple Tiara. While there is some disagreement over which three races make up the Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing, the Arabian list is more formal and consists of Daughters of the Desert Oaks in California, the Texas Yellow Rose Stakes, and the Cre Run Oaks in Delaware.\nBetting.\nHorse racing betting is legal in the United States with a unique legal status compared to other forms of gambling. The Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 grants specific exemptions to horse racing from federal anti-gambling laws. American betting on horse racing is sanctioned and regulated by the state the racetrack is located in.\nSimulcast betting almost always exists across state lines with no oversight except for the companies involved through legalized parimutuel gambling. As of February 2024, pari-mutuel betting on horse races is legal in around 32 states. A few states have banned betting on horse racing, including Alaska, Hawaii, Utah, etc. A takeout, or \"take\", is removed from each betting pool and distributed according to state law, among the state, race track and horsemen. On average, 17 percent is withheld from win, place and show pools, with 83 percent being returned to the winning players. A variety of factors affect takeout, namely location and the type of wager that is placed. For example, one regional track circuit in the United States has four different takeout rates for different types of bets with a total blended rate that exceeds 20 percent.\nAdvanced deposit wagering.\nAdvanced deposit wagering is a form of gambling on the outcome of horse races in which the bettor must fund his or her account before being allowed to place bets. ADW is often conducted online or by phone. In contrast to ADW, credit shops allow wagers without advance funding; accounts are settled at month-end. Racetrack owners, horse trainers and state governments sometimes receive a cut of ADW revenues.\nIt typically involves betting on horse or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools."

        "title": "Paraguay at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nParaguay have appeared in the finals of the World Cup on eight occasions, the first being at the very first finals in 1930, where they finished in 9th position. Their last participation in the tournament was in 2010, when they reached the quarter-finals for the first time.\nThe results.\nParaguay competed at three World Cups by 1958, and after a long gap they re-appeared in 1986. Later, they achieved a streak of four participations: South Africa 2010 was Paraguay's fourth consecutive trip to the World Cup final tournament, having previously qualified for the final in 1998, 2002 and 2006. After a poor qualifying campaign, however, Paraguay failed to qualify for the tournament in 2014, missing out on the chance to play in a World Cup hosted on their own continent, in Brazil. Three times they survived the first round of the international football tournament, with the highlight being in 2010 where they reached the quarter-finals.\n1930 FIFA World Cup.\nIn the first round, Paraguay debuted and lost to the United States (0–3), to then defeat Belgium (1–0) with a goal by Luis Vargas Peña. Only one team was to advance from the group stage, and the U.S. left Paraguay behind.\nLinesmen:\nMartin Aphesteguy (Uruguay)\nAnibal Tejada (Uruguay)\nLinesmen:\nJosé Macías (Argentina)\nDomingo Lombardi (Uruguay)\n1950 FIFA World Cup.\nIn their return to the World Cup, Paraguay faced Sweden and Italy in Group 3. Paraguay failed to advance to the next round after a 2–2 draw against Sweden and a 2–0 loss against Italy.\n1958 FIFA World Cup.\nFor the 1958 World Cup, Paraguay surprisingly qualified ahead of Uruguay (beating them 5–0 in the decisive game) with a team that contained a formidable attacking lineup with stars such as Juan Bautista Agüero, José Parodi, Juan Romero, Cayetano Ré and Florencio Amarilla. In their first game in Sweden, Paraguay were 3–2 up against France in a game they lost 7–3. A 3–2 win over Scotland and a 3–3 draw with Yugoslavia saw Paraguay finish third in their group.\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nParaguay ended a 28-year absence from the World Cup in 1986 with a team starring Roberto Fernández in goal; Cesar Zabala, Rogelio Delgado and Juan Bautista Torales in defense; Jorge Amado Nunes and Vladimiro Schettina in midfield; midfield playmaker Julio César Romero and strikers Roberto Cabañas, Ramón Hicks and Rolando Chilavert (older brother of José Luis Chilavert). In first round matches, Paraguay defeated Iraq (1–0, goal Romerito) and then tied Mexico (1–1, goal Romerito) and Belgium (2–2, both goals Roberto Cabañas). They reached the second round where they were beaten 3–0 by England.\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nA new generation of players helped end the World Cup drought in grand fashion, as the Albirroja reached the 1998 World Cup in France by qualifying in second place in South America, behind Argentina. The first round matches were against Bulgaria (0–0), Spain (0–0), and Nigeria (3–1; goals Celso Ayala, Miguel Ángel Benítez and José Cardozo). Paraguay qualified to the second round (round of 16) to be defeated in a thrilling match against hosts and eventual World Champions France. France only scored through Laurent Blanc in the 114th minute, during the second half of overtime (making it the first golden goal scored in a World Cup). Paraguay's central defending duo (Carlos Gamarra and Celso Ayala) and goalkeeper José Luis Chilavert were selected for the all-star World Cup team.\nAssistant referees:\nAchmat Salie (South Africa)\nHussain Ghadanfari (Kuwait)\nFourth official:\nNikolai Levnikov (Russia)\nAssistant referees:\nAristidis Chris Soldatos (South Africa)\nOwen Powell (Jamaica)\nFourth official:\nEsse Baharmast (United States)\nAssistant referees:\nMohamed Al Musawi (Oman)\nMikael Milsson (Sweden)\nFourth official:\nMasayoshi Okada (Japan)\nAssistant referees:\nNimal Wickeramatunge (Sri Lanka)\nLencie Fred (Vanuatu)\nFourth official:\nEsse Baharmast (United States)\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nParaguay returned to the world's greatest stage once more in the 2002 World Cup. In their first match, Paraguay tied South Africa 2–2 (goals: Roque Santa Cruz and Francisco Arce). Paraguay lost to Spain in the second game (1–3) and finally defeated Slovenia (3–1; goals Nelson Cuevas, twice, and Jorge Luis Campos) to qualify for the second round. Germany ended Paraguay's dreams in the World Cup with an 88-minute goal.\n\"All times local (UTC+9)\"\nMan of the Match:\nFrancisco Arce (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nIgor Šramka (Slovakia)\nCurtis Charles (Antigua and Barbuda)\nFourth official:\nHugh Dallas (Scotland)\nMan of the Match:\nFernando Morientes (Spain)\nAssistant referees:\nWagih Farag (Egypt)\nBrighton Mudzamiri (Zimbabwe)\nFourth official:\nMohamed Guezzaz (Morocco)\nMan of the Match:\nNelson Cuevas (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nLeif Lindberg (Sweden)\nVisva Krishnan (Singapore)\nFourth official:\nKim Young-joo (South Korea)\nMan of the Match:\nJens Jeremies (Germany)\nAssistant referees:\nCurtis Charles (Antigua and Barbuda)\nDramane Dante (Mali)\nFourth official:\nHugh Dallas (Scotland)\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nIn 2006, Paraguay qualified for its third World Cup in a row. This time, two early defeats against England and Sweden (both 0–1) sent the team home early. The only consolation was defeating Trinidad and Tobago during the last and final group game by 2–0.\n\"All times local (CEST/UTC+2)\"\nMan of the Match:\nFrank Lampard (England)\nAssistant referees:\nJosé Luis Camargo (Mexico)\nLeonel Leal (Costa Rica)\nFourth official:\nCoffi Codjia (Benin)\nFifth official:\nCelestin Ntagungira (Rwanda)\nMan of the Match:\nFreddie Ljungberg (Sweden)\nAssistant referees:\nRoman Slysko (Slovakia)\nMartin Balko (Slovakia)\nFourth official:\nJerome Damon (South Africa)\nFifth official:\nEnock Molefe (South Africa)\nMan of the Match:\nJulio dos Santos (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nCristiano Copelli (Italy)\nAlessandro Stagnelli (Italy)\nFourth official:\nFrank De Bleeckere (Belgium)\nFifth official:\nPeter Hermans (Belgium)\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nIn their fourth consecutive World Cup appearance, Paraguay eventually reached the quarter-finals. Drawn into Group F along with defending champions Italy, Slovakia and New Zealand, they opened their tournament with a draw against the Italians, in a game where they took the lead thanks to a first-half goal from Antolín Alcaraz but ultimately finished 1-1. In their second match, they beat Slovakia 2–0 with goals from Enrique Vera and Christian Riveros. Their final group match saw a goalless draw with New Zealand, clinching first place in Group F and setting up a date with Japan. Another goalless draw with the Japanese after 120 minutes went to penalties, which Paraguay won 5–3, advancing them for the first time in their history to the World Cup round of eight. In the quarter-finals, they met powerhouses Spain, to whom they lost 1–0 in a game where a goal by Nelson Valdez was controversially called an offside by the referee. The game also featured each team being awarded a penalty, both of which were contained, first by Spain's Iker Casillas and then Paraguay's Justo Villar (both were also team captains for the game).\nThe \"Albirroja\" arrived back from South Africa on Monday, July 5 at 3:30 AM. Upon arrival, they were greeted by over 3,000 fans at the airport and were decorated by the President of Paraguay. Gerardo Martino announced that he would take some time to decide his future, although the Paraguayan Football Association has offered him a four-year contract to continue at the helm. Roque Santa Cruz also announced that this would be his last World Cup, but that he may play one more tournament, the Copa América in Argentina in 2011, which he ended up playing in.\n\"All times local (UTC+02)\"\nMan of the Match:\nAntolín Alcaraz (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nHéctor Vergara (Canada)\nMarvin Torrentera (Mexico)\nFourth official:\nJoel Aguilar (El Salvador)\nFifth official:\nJuan Zumba (El Salvador)\nMan of the Match:\nEnrique Vera (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nEvarist Menkouande (Cameroon)\nBechir Hassani (Tunisia)\nFourth official:\nJoel Aguilar (El Salvador)\nFifth official:\nJuan Zumba (El Salvador)\nMan of the Match:\nRoque Santa Cruz (Paraguay)\nAssistant referees:\nToru Sagara (Japan)\nJeong Hae-sang (South Korea)\nFourth official:\nKoman Coulibaly (Mali)\nFifth official:\nInacio Manuel Candido (Angola)\nParaguay and Japan met at the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria on 29 June 2010. The match was decided by a penalty shootout after the score was locked at 0–0 for 120 minutes. Paraguay won the shootout and progressed to its first ever World Cup quarter-final. The match was a generally unexciting affair, as Japan adopted a defensive posture while Paraguay itself maintained a solid defence. The first half produced the occasional chance on goal with Lucas Barrios having a shot saved shortly before a long-distance shot from Daisuke Matsui hit the crossbar of Paraguay's goal. The second half was similar, with either side producing occasional chances to score rather than periods of dominance. The result of the deadlock was extra time, which continued goalless. A penalty shootout ensued, in which Yūichi Komano missed a spot kick for Japan. Paraguay scored all five of its penalties, clinching the win and passage to the quarter-finals. After the match, Japan head coach Takeshi Okada resigned and Shunsuke Nakamura retired from international football.\nMan of the Match:\nKeisuke Honda (Japan)\nAssistant referees:\nPeter Hermans (Belgium)\nWalter Vromans (Belgium)\nFourth official:\nPeter O'Leary (New Zealand)\nFifth official:\nMatthew Taro (Solomon Islands)\nOn 3 July 2010, Spain defeated Paraguay 1–0 to secure entry to the semi-finals where they would meet Germany. It was the first time that Spain had progressed to the semi-final of a World Cup since 1950; while for the defeated Paraguay, the quarter-final appearance was also the country's best ever performance.\nThe first half of the match finished goalless, although both sides had chances to score and Paraguay's Nelson Valdez had a goal ruled out as offside. The match suddenly became eventful in the second half due to a string of penalty kicks. First, Óscar Cardozo was pulled down by Gerard Piqué in Spain's penalty area and Paraguay was awarded a penalty. Cardozo took the penalty himself but it was saved by Spain's goalkeeper Iker Casillas. Spain soon after launched an attack at the other end of the field, in which David Villa was ruled by the referee to have been brought down by Antolín Alcaraz. Xabi Alonso stepped up to take the penalty kick and seemed to have scored, only for the referee to order it be retaken because of encroachment by a Spanish player into the penalty area before the kick was taken. Xabi Alonso's retake was saved by Paraguayan goalkeeper Justo Villar. As a result, the score remained 0–0 after the three penalty kicks. Spain, however, ultimately managed to take the lead in the 82nd minute: David Villa collected a rebounded shot off the post from Pedro, to score himself off the post. The goal turned out to be the winner for Spain. After the match, Spain coach Vicente del Bosque conceded that his side were not playing at their best and were starved of possession. He also noted his view that Spain's next opponents Germany were the best team at the World Cup. Paraguay coach Gerardo Martino stated he would be leaving his position at the end of his contract.\nMan of the Match:\nAndrés Iniesta (Spain)\nAssistant referees:\nLeonel Leal (Costa Rica)\nCarlos Pastrana (Honduras)\nFourth official:\nBenito Archundia (Mexico)\nFifth official:\nHéctor Vergara (Canada)"

        "text": "Canal Shores Golf Course (formerly known as the Peter N. Jans Memorial Golf Course and the Evanston Wilmette Community Golf Course) is an 82-acre, 18-hole, par 60 golf course located in a suburban residential neighborhood on the east side of Evanston, Illinois, and Wilmette, Illinois. Founded in 1919 on the banks of the North Shore Channel of the Chicago River, the course is 3,904 yards in length, featuring a narrow and tree-lined fairway and two over-the-water holes. Eleven of the holes are located in Evanston, Illinois, and seven holes are in Wilmette, Illinois.\nHistory.\nPeter N. Jans, a golf professional and Evanston civic leader, championed the reclamation of the undeveloped canal banks for a golf course in north Evanston. Todd Sloan, who also laid out the back nine of the Racine Country Club in Wisconsin, is credited as the architect of the present-day Canal Shores Golf Course, which has been renamed several times during the past century. The course was built on the site of the previous location of the Evanston Golf Club, which relocated due to the construction of the North Shore Channel drainage project. The course is built substantially on public property and is managed and funded by the Evanston Wilmette Golf Course Association, a volunteer organization composed of golfers and neighbors in the City of Evanston and Village of Wilmette.\nIn August 2014 Joel Murray hosted the Tour of Duty Golf Classic at Canal Shores, a benefit to assist first responders.\nNorth Shore Open.\nCanal Shores Golf Course, together with Skokie Sports Park, has played host to the annual North Shore Open golf tournament since 2015. The event was founded by Evanston resident Orin Brown, and the winner receives a ceremonial picture taken while sitting in a tire. Dan Skowronski holds the record for the lowest score with a 133, which was accomplished in 2021. The North Shore Channel plays a role on most of Canal Shores' 18-hole layout and the channel runs just east of Skokie Sports Park."

        "text": "The 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the title game of the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2010-11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 4, 2011 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, and featured the West Regional Champion, #3-seeded Connecticut, versus the Southeast Regional Champion, #8 seeded Butler.\nFor the first time since the 1989 National Championship Game, neither a #1 nor a #2 seed participated in the National Championship Game.\nParticipants.\nButler Bulldogs.\nThe Butler Bulldogs had made it back to the national championship for the second year in a row after losing their best player and eventual NBA star Gordon Hayward of the Oklahoma City Thunder. In their opener, they squeaked by Old Dominion 60-58. In the following game, Matt Howard made the game-winning free throw against Pittsburgh to come out on top 71-70. After defeating the Wisconsin Badgers in the Sweet Sixteen 61-54, they took the Florida Gators into overtime, emerging victorious 74-71 to earn a spot in the Final Four. They would defeat the Cinderella of the tournament, VCU, in a closely contested game 70-62 to return to their second consecutive national championship game.\nConnecticut Huskies.\nAfter failing to make the NCAA tournament the previous year, UConn got off to a hot start, winning their first 10 games of the 2010-11 season - including victories over #2 Michigan State and #8 Kentucky in the Maui Invitational - and climbing as high as #4 in the AP poll. However, they went on stumble down the stretch, finishing 9th in the Big East with a 9-9 record in conference play. Nonetheless, they earned a #3 seed in the West Region. After coasting to an easy victory over Buckner 81-52 in the first round, the Huskies defeated the Cincinnati Bear Cats 69-58 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. After fighting past a dangerous San Diego State team that had entered the game with a 34-2 record 74-67, UConn faced off against Arizona in the Elite Eight. Behind the phenomenal play of Kemba Walker, the Huskies beat the Wildcats in a thriller 65-63 to advance to their 4th ever Final Four. They would pull off a 56-55 victory over the Kentucky Wildcats to set up a national championship match up with Butler.\nGame summary.\nFor the first time since 1989 there was not a #1 or #2 seed team in the championship game. Butler was only the second #8 seed to make it the championship game after the 1985 Villanova team, who took down the top-seeded Georgetown 66-64 in the final. The 2011 national championship game was between Butler, a mid-major university team that was a surprise finalist in the 2010 tournament, and The University of Connecticut, a basketball powerhouse which had previously won the tournament twice under coach Jim Calhoun but had had an average regular season, finishing 9th in the Big East before winning the conference tournament with five victories in five consecutive days (never before accomplished in NCAA history). The NCAA championship game was a very defensive contest, with UConn coming out on top 52-41 to win their third-ever national title and Butler scoring the fewest points in a championship game since 1949. The Bulldogs led at halftime 22–19, but suffered in the second half from poor shooting, making only 6 out of 37 shots in the second half. Butler's 18.8 percent shooting for the entire game was the lowest ever in the NCAA final. UConn contributed to Butler's poor shooting by blocking 10 shots, also a championship game record. Butler was led in scoring by junior guard Shelvin Mack with 13 points, while UConn freshman Jeremy Lamb scored 12 points in the 2nd half. The win by the Huskies completed a season-ending 11-game win streak that had begun with the Big East Tournament. The game was widely viewed as a poor-quality final. In reference to the game's first half of play, CBS analyst Greg Anthony said, \"This is the worst half of basketball I've ever seen in a national championship game.”"

During the game, 244 total points were scored (102 scored during overtime), 211 field goals were attempted (103 attempted in overtime), 93 free throws were attempted, 66 fouls were committed, and eight total players fouled out (four from each team).\nThis game was the second-longest in college basketball history and the longest in Big East history.

The opening three tests, United States, Canada and Argentina, coincided with the June international window, whereas the test against South Africa fell outside the international window. This meant players playing outside Scotland at club level were not permitted to be released by their clubs to represent Scotland against South Africa; Scotland effectively picked two separate squads, one for the USA and Canada games, the other for Argentina and South Africa.\nThe tour was the start of Vern Cotter's period in charge. Head coach Andy Robinson had resigned in November 2012, and the Scottish Rugby Union had appointed the subsequent interim coach Scott Johnson as Director of Rugby. Scotland lost their match to South Africa but won all three of their Americas tests.\nSquads.\nOn 20 May, Head Coach Vern Cotter named two squads for the tour; a 27-man squad for the North America leg and a 25-man squad for the Argentina-South Africa leg - 9 players were initially named in both squads. The reasoning was for Cotter to look at as many players as possible. It also meant that players playing outside Scotland at club level, were not selected in the Argentina-South Africa squad, which was predominantly made up of Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby players.\nJack Cuthbert, Matt Scott, Ross Rennie and Ryan Wilson were not considered due to injury.\nHead coach: Vern Cotter\nNorth America leg.\nOn 1 June, Grayson Hart was added to the North America squad, in addition to the Argentina-South Africa squad, to cover the injured Chris Cusiter.

At the time, the World-Cup had one of the highest monetary prizes. Between 1986 and 1989, the prize money per tournament was approximately  DM, with the winner receiving  DM. The BWA organized the World-Cup along with the world governing body, the Union Mondiale de Billard (UMB).\nBetween 1988 and 1993, the UMB no longer hosted any world championships themselves, therefore, for four years, the BWA World-Cup became the default world championship. In 1994 there were disagreements between the two associations. The UMB thus blocked players, including players wives, referees and organizers who took part in the World Cup, from participating in the tournaments of the UMB and CEB (Confédération Européenne de Billard). Thus, between 1994 and 1997, there were two parallel World-Cup championships. The BWA, as usual, played for 3rd place (the only exception was the tournament 1997/7 ), whereas the UMB did not, and therefore had two 3rd-place finishers. (With few exceptions, since the acquisition of the tournament in 1999, this is the rule up to now) .\nAfter settling the disputes, the UMB and the BWA led the tournament together until early 1999 (Berlin Cup). After 1999, Mr. Bayer withdrew from the BWA for health reasons, and the UMB took over the organization of the tournament series from then on and the BWA broke up due to succession problems.\nFrom 1994, the UMB tournaments were organized in collaboration with the European member association “Confédération Européenne de Billard” (CEB). Since 2004, the World-Cup has been organized as UMB/CEB (in Europe), UMB/CPB (in America), UMB/(in Amerika), UMB/ACBC World-Cup (in Asia), and since 2014, as UMB/ACC in Africa. The prize money amounts to approximately  € per tournament. The prize money has been €106,500 per tournament since 2018.\nAll detailed results are listed on the german Three-Cushion World Cup page.\nThe individual results of the World Cup 1997/1 were lost directly following the tournament and, up to now, have been unable to be reconstructed, even through research by the well-known billiards archivists Heinrich Weingartner and Dieter Haase (both editors of the three-volume \"Encyclopedia of Billiards Sports\").\nIn 2012, only three tournaments were held for the overall winner appointment, instead of the required four, thus the year remains the first year without a title award. On 26 January 2013 it was announced that the Greek shipping magnate, Thanos Athanasiou, until 1995 a player himself, would finance a total of five tournaments in the coming three years. These include the three World-Cup tournaments until 2015, as well as the Junior World Championships in 2013 and the Women's World-Cup in 2014. All tournaments will be played in Athens.\nMedia Report Transmission.\nUntil the 2019/20 season, the French billiards portal Kozoom broadcast all UMB tournaments on the Internet and some of them were also taken over by the national broadcasters that hosted them. From the 2021/22 season, this task will be taken over by the Korean partner of Kozoom Five&amp;Six.\nModus.\nInitially, the game was played in a set system of up to 15 points, with two winning sets to be completed in the qualification and then three winning sets in the final round. In 2013 they switched to the points system, with up to 30 points being played in the qualification and up to 40 points in the final round. At the change of season in 2019, the first final round will also be held as a group round (8 ×) of 4 players each.\nPrize money and ranking points.\nDate of issue: 20 December 2017\nTournament records timeline.\nWith the set system, the best individual average (SA) is only counted in the game with 3 winning sets. This also applies to the GA, where at least five games must be played. Since the maximum streak of 15 points was achieved a total of 42 times in the days of the set system, players who have reached this number of points several times are only mentioned with their first streak. The numbers in brackets indicate the frequency.\nThe best Worldcup-Players (by Ranking-Points).\nDate: 4.

This puts the players in the first 98 tournaments at a disadvantage"

        "title": "Golf La Moraleja",
        "text": "Golf La Moraleja is one of Spain's most important clubs. It is the largest Spanish golf club for its number of holes and the largest in Europe located in a metropolitan area. Founded in 1973, it currently has four 18-hole golf courses, all rated par 72, designed by Jack Nicklaus. It also contains a 9-hole short course, 8 tennis courts, 12 paddle tennis courts, 2 squash courts, one covered and three open-air swimming pools, a gym and a spa. Added to these are two clubhouses, a children's chalet and a tennis clubhouse (on 1 and 2 courses), plus a prebuilt modular clubhouse for courses 3 and 4. Courses 1 and 2 are located at La Moraleja residential estate (Alcobendas, Madrid). Courses 3 and 4 are located in the municipality of Algete. It has 6,000 shareholder members. In 2013 it was voted the best golf course in Spain by Deporte &amp; Business and in 2014, La Moraleja 3 was voted the second best golf course in Spain by the American magazine \" Golf Digest\". The club has hosted competitions such as the World Cup of Golf, the Spanish Open and the Paddle Tennis World Championship.\nCourse 1.\nDesigned by Jack Nicklaus, it is the oldest of the Golf La Moraleja courses. Play began on the course in 1975 and it was officially opened in 1976. It is a short course, narrow and very technical. The lakes and the off-limits play a very important role in the strategy of the game on each hole. Only one of the eighteen holes has no off-limits. The greens are small but very rapid on account of their undulations. Most noteworthy is the 18th hole, a short par 5 with an off-limits on the right and, on the left, a lake which defies any attempts to reach green in two shots. There is also a 9-hole short course, in pitch &amp; putt style, for training and practice; a practice range with 20 covered and 22 uncovered booths; a putting-green, a green for short game practice and a practice bunker.\nCard of the Course. Pitch &amp; Putt Course Card. Quadrants map\nCourse 2.\nCourse 2 is an 18-hole course from the drawing board of Nicklaus Design under the direction of Ron Kirby, which was officially opened in 1990. It measures 6,326 metres from the professional tees and also has a practice range with fifteen covered booths, a putting-green, a green for short game play and a practice bunker. The tiered configuration of the terrain around most of the holes allows spectators to follow the game in comfort during competitions. The course is longer than La Moraleja 1 but also wider and with less vegetation, whereby out-of-line shots are not too badly penalized. There are four lakes which affect six holes. The 16th is a particularly outstanding hole for its beauty and strategic complexity, with its green situated on a tongue of land, which at one and the same time encourages and intimidates players who attempt to reach it in two shots.\nCard of the Course. Quadrants Map\nCourse 3.\nCourse 3 is also the work of Jack Nicklaus. The design has transformed a terrain that was originally flat by introducing small hills at different points, of varying significance, in order to achieve a course with multiple play options on almost all the holes. It is configured as a long, classical, parkland-type course, measuring a total of 6,830 metres, a good challenge for holding important tournaments; although also very pleasant for any amateur to play. Its fairways are wide and its greens, in general, are spacious. It has three enormous lakes which affect half of the holes, more than 1,200 trees and 68 bunkers. Strategy here is more important than distance: it obliges one to carefully think out each shot in order to achieve a better option for the following shot. Nicklaus has taken care to make it so, as indeed to favour players capable of achieving powerful fades.\nLa Moraleja 3 was voted the second best golf course in Spain by the American magazine Golf Digest.\nCard of the Course.\nCourse 4.\nCourse 4 of Golf La Moraleja, designed by the Nicklaus Design company, is 6,350 metres long. It is an original course with isles of vegetation, a terrain with slight mounds, lakes with aquatic plants. It also offers different opening shot possibilities from the tee in order to multiply play options and offer different strategies. A prebuilt modular clubhouse services courses 3 and 4, which also provides a practice area for long and short play.\nCard of the Course.\nHistory.\nGolf La Moraleja, S.A. was created in 1973 as a Public Limited Company with the aim of creating facilities for playing golf, for the enjoyment of its 6,000 shareholders. In 1974, grounds were acquired, now occupied by the complex comprising the Clubhouse and Course 1, including the Children's chalet and the maintenance area. The golf course was built between 1974 and 1975, designed and directed by Jack Nicklaus and officially opened in 1976 with a competition in which Valentín Barrios, Sam Snead, Tom Weiskopf and Jack Nicklaus himself took part.\nIn 1989 the grounds where Course 2 now stands were acquired by the company and La Moraleja 2 was opened in 1990. The design of this second golf course came from the drawing board of Nicklaus Designs, under the direction of Ron Kirby. In 2003, negotiations for the sale of a plot of 33 hectares were commenced, which at the time accommodated the Course 2 tennis courts and which the Madrid City Council had reassessed three years previously. The sale endowed Golf La Moraleja with the revenue which the Members Meeting decided was to be used to finance the construction of Courses 3 and 4, which were opened for play in September 2012 and officially inaugurated in April 2013.\nThe singer and actor Bing Crosby died of a heart attack at Golf La Moraleja on the 14th of October 1977, during a golfing holiday to Madrid."

Based on the fact the Maroons and the Wisconsin Badgers had split the two games during the regular season, Coach Raycroft and Wisconsin physical education director Charles P. Hutchins agreed that a title game needed to be played. The game was played in Madison, however, the Maroons came out victorious and were not only awarded the conference title, this also determined who would meet the Quakers of Pennsylvania.\nIt would only take two games for the Maroons to win the series. The first game was played at Bartlett Gymnasium with a final score of 21 to 18. The second game was played in Philadelphia with a final score of 18 to 16. \nBesides the fact that a series of games were played to determine a national champion, the Maroons proved that they were worthy of the title by defeating 23 of the 25 opponents they faced during the season. Meanwhile, with a season that included over 20 games, Pennsylvania met and defeated all of the teams they faced in the east.\nSchedule.\n "

Most notable for their competition recurve bows, which are featured prominently in the Olympics; every gold medalist in individual archery at the 2012 Summer Olympics shot a Hoyt recurve. Hoyt is owned by Jas. D. Easton, Inc.\nHistory.\nHoyt was founded in 1931 in St. Louis, Missouri with Earl Hoyt Sr. and his son producing hand made cedar arrows and wooden bows. In 1983, Hoyt was purchased by California-based sporting goods equipment manufacturer Jas D. Easton Inc., and its headquarters moved to Salt Lake City. Hoyt is currently a division of the Easton-family owned Jas. D. Easton, Inc. which also owns Easton Technical Products, manufacturers of arrows, tent tubing and medical tubing.\nAbout Earl Hoyt Sr.\nEarl Hoyt Sr. was the founder, owner, and president of Hoyt archery and was born in 1911, where he lived in St. Louis, MO. In 1931 he started his company Hoyt Archery. In 1971 Earl married his wife Ann Weber Hoyt, they met many times at exhibition and on a tournament, and started to date around the 1960s. They later had a son, Bright Hoyt, born in 1980. Earl would sit behind Ann during competitions before they began to date.\nTechnology.\nSource:\nZero Torque Hyper Cam: This is a patent-pending design that reduces the torque introduced by the cables. This cam system creates a balanced load by incorporating a split cable system which makes this a smooth, fast, and when the cams rotate they let off the most.\nZero Torque Cable Guard System: This cable guide is mounted reverse to allow the torque introduced by the normal cable guide to be directed in the opposite direction. This means that any torque created by the cams will be neutralized which means it will be easier to tune and align the bow.\nX3 Cam &amp; ½: This Cam system is adjustable by half an inch increments. This cam is available in 65% or 75% let off and has a lighter back wall which makes it smoother than the SVX cam.\nX-Lite Prolock Pocket: The super tight tolerance pocket means the connection between the riser and limbs will make the bow even more accurate and consistent. This is important to have as tight tolerances in this area since it is critical to the accuracy and consistency of the bow. \nX-Act Grip: This grip is designed to allow the user to consistently put your hand in the same and right place. Proper Hand placement is critical to ensure accurate and consistent shots. The engineers at Hoyt shaped the grip to ensure that you get the best hand placement.\nUniform Stress Distribution: These limbs are contoured limbs that as they bend they store more and more energy which at full draw it will produce the most speed and create less stress on the limbs since they become straighter as they are being loaded. \nUltraflex Limb System: This limb system works with the DFX cam system which creates a head position that you can achieve consistently. This system makes a 30.5 inch axle to axle bow feel like a 34-inch axle to axle length bow.\nIn Popular Culture.\nThe Hoyt Buffalo hunting recurve was used by the character Hawkeye in the \"Avengers\" movie, as well as by Katniss Everdeen in \"The Hunger Games\" series. The Hoyt Gamemaster II was used by Hawkeye in '. The Hoyt/Spectra bow was the principal silent weapon used by Sylvester Stallone as John Rambo in ' and \"Rambo III\". In the backstory Rambo had attained skill with a bow since childhood. In the film he uses arrows tipped with explosive warheads."

        "text": "The 2005 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 2005 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2004-05 NCAA Division I men's basketball season The game was played on April 4, 2005, at Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis, Missouri and featured the Chicago Regional Champion, overall #1-seed Illinois and Syracuse Regional Champion, #1-seeded North Carolina. This marked the first time since 1999 that the national championship game was played between two #1 seeds.\nNorth Carolina took off with a 40–27 lead at the half and Illinois failed to mount a comeback win after coming back as much as 15. The Tar Heels won 75–70, for their 4th national championship, and first under Roy Williams. As of 2024, this remains Illinois’ sole appearance in the national championship game.\nParticipants.\nIllinois Fighting Illini.\nIllinois entered the tournament as the #1 seed in the Chicago Regional. In the 1st round, Illinois survived a scare from Fairleigh Dickinson, rolling away with a 67–55 win after leading by just one at halftime. In the 2nd round, Illinois beat Nevada 71-59 for the chance to face Milwaukee in the Sweet 16 and in the Sweet 16, the Illinois backcourt propelled them to a 77–63 win over Milwaukee to advance to the Chicago Regional Finals. In the Chicago Regional Finals, Illinois came back from a 15-point deficit with four minutes remaining to beat Arizona 90–89 in overtime to keep Illinois title hopes alive with a trip to their fifth-ever Final Four. In the Final Four, Illinois dominated Louisville in the 2nd half, outscoring them 41–29. They would go on to win 72-57 and advance to the national championship game.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nNorth Carolina entered the tournament as the #1 seed in the Syracuse Regional. In the 1st round, North Carolina used 73% shooting in the 1st half to claim a 96–68 victory over Oakland. In the 2nd round, Sean May dominated with a double-double with 24 points and 17 rebounds and Marvin Williams also dominated with a double-double with 20 points and 15 rebounds which led to UNC beating Iowa State for a chance to face Villanova in the Sweet 16 and North Carolina would hold off Villanova in the Sweet 16 beating them 67–66 to advance to the Elite Eight. In the Elite Eight, Sean May had a double-double with 29 points and 12 rebounds and Rashad McCants scored 21 points to beat Wisconsin 88–82 to advance to the Final Four. In the Final Four, North Carolina beat Michigan State 87–71 to advance to the title game .\nGame summary.\nNorth Carolina was playing looking for its 4th National Championship while Illinois was playing in its first National Championship. It was a tight contest for much of the first half before an 8–0 run by North Carolina allowed them to take a 35–25 lead. Eventually they would take a 40–27 lead into halftime. North Carolina increased its lead to 15 at one point in the second half. But Illinois began a furious charge. At one point, they would hit seven consecutive shots from the floor to turn a fifteen-point lead back to four. Unfazed, North Carolina would push the lead back up to ten before a 10–0 run by the Illini tied the game at 65-65. Illinois would tie the game at 70–70 on a three by Luther Head. But North Carolina would fight back as freshman Marvin Williams tapped back a Rashad McCants missed shot to put North Carolina back in front. Illinois would get several cracks to take the lead but were unable to convert. Eventually, Raymond Felton was able to steal the ball from Luther Head, forcing Deron Williams to foul. However Felton converted on 1 of 2 free throws giving Illinois one last chance. Head's potential game-tying three pointer bounced high and out and went into the hands of Felton who this time connected on both free throws to give North Carolina a 75–70 victory. Illinois struggled offensively with what had succeeded the rest of the season, converting only 12 of a championship game record 40 three-point field goal attempts. With his stellar post play, North Carolina forward Sean May managed to get Illinois defenders into foul trouble; starting junior forward/center James Augustine fouled out, and his substitute, senior Jack Ingram, quickly amassed four fouls. May scored 26 points as he took the Most Outstanding Player (MOP) of the Final Four.\nFor North Carolina head coach Roy Williams, it was his first national championship. Illinois was denied a chance to set the NCAA record for most wins in a season, instead tying the 1998–99 national runner-up Duke team with 37 (Kentucky has since won 38 games in two different seasons). For almost the entire 2004–05 season, Illinois and North Carolina were ranked #1 and #2, respectively, in all polls, and both teams were the favorites to meet in the national championship game. With its collection of raw talent, North Carolina would go on to field six players in the NBA draft, while four Illinois players would be selected in future drafts, with undrafted Roger Powell, Jr. also playing briefly in the NBA. In 2014, Sports Illustrated voted the 2005 Illinois team as the best team ever to not win a title."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Boston College Eagles men's ice hockey team represented Boston College in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. The team was coached by Jerry York, '67, his twenty-first season behind the bench at Boston College. The Eagles played their home games at Kelley Rink on the campus of Boston College, competing in Hockey East.\nThe Eagles competed in two tournaments during the 2014–15 season. On January 2–3, the Eagles earned a trophy at the Ledyard Bank Classic, also known as the Dartmouth Showcase Tournament, hosted by Dartmouth College. Because the tournament was not bracketed (i.e. the winners of the first games did not face each other in a championship match), the Eagles won by virtue of points earned; they won both of their games, as Denver and Brown both won one and tied the other, and as host Dartmouth lost both of their games. On February 3 and 23, the Eagles played in the 63rd Annual Beanpot Tournament at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts, losing to Northeastern by a score of 3–2 in the first round and winning the consolation game over Harvard 3–2 in OT, the first time since 2008 that the Eagles did not win the Beanpot tournament.\nThe Eagles finished 21–14–3, and 12–7–3 in conference play, good for the 3rd seed and a first-round bye entering the 2015 Hockey East tournament. However, they would lose to the Vermont Catamounts during the best-of-three quarterfinals in three games at home, marking the second year in a row in which the Eagles did not advance to at least the semifinals. The Eagles qualified for the 2015 NCAA tournament and were placed in the east regional at Providence. They lost to Denver 5–2 in the first round.\nPrevious season recap.\nThe Eagles entered the 2014–15 season following a Frozen Four loss to Union College in the NCAA tournament, and a quarterfinals loss to Notre Dame in the Hockey East Tournament. The Eagles did capture three trophies during the 2013–14 season, finishing with a strong 28–8–4 record and 16–2–2 in conference play, good for the Hockey East regular season title, as well as their fifth consecutive Beanpot championship in a 4–1 win over Northeastern. Junior Johnny Gaudreau won numerous accolades including the 2014 Hobey Baker Award after a fantastic league-leading 36 goal, 44 assist, 80 point season. He chose to forgo his senior year of eligibility to enter the NHL with the Calgary Flames.\nOffseason.\nFour Senior Eagles graduated in May: Captain Patrick Brown – F, Assistant Captain Bill Arnold – F, Assistant Captain Isaac MacLeod – D, and Kevin Hayes – F.\nJunior forward Johnny Gaudreau decided to forgo his senior year of eligibility to enter the NHL, signing with his drafted team, the Calgary Flames.\nJunior defensemen Mike Matheson was named Captain, with seniors Quinn Smith and Michael Sit named Assistant Captains for the 2014–15 season.\nOn June 4, sophomore forward Evan Richardson transferred to UConn after receiving limited playing time in his freshman year, joining former BC Assistant Coach, Mike Cavanaugh, head coach of the Huskies.\nOn June 28, goalie Thatcher Demko was drafted 36th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft.\nOn August 12, graduated defenseman Isaac MacLeod signed a contract with the Elmira Jackals of the ECHL.\nOn August 16, York announced that incoming-freshman Sonny Milano decided to forgo an NCAA career at Boston College, opting to sign directly with his drafted team, the Columbus Blue Jackets.\nOn August 20, graduated forward Kevin Hayes signed an entry level deal with the New York Rangers.

The Spartans, led by 20th year head coach Tom Izzo, played their home games at the Breslin Center in East Lansing, Michigan as members of the Big Ten Conference. MSU finished with a record of 27–12, 12–6 in Big Ten play to finish in a three-way tie for third place. They defeated Ohio State and Maryland to advance to the Big Ten tournament championship where they lost to Wisconsin. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 7 seed in the East region. They defeated Georgia and Virginia to advance to the Sweet Sixteen.They defeated Oklahoma and Louisville to advance to the Final Four for the seventh time under Tom Izzo. There the Spartans lost to eventual National Champion, Duke.\nPrevious season.\nThe Spartans finished the 2013–14 season with a record of 29–9, 12–6 in Big Ten play to finish in second place. They won the Big Ten tournament by defeating Michigan and received the conference's automatic bid as a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, their 17th straight trip to the Tournament. They advanced to the Elite Eight, their eighth trip under Tom Izzo, before losing to eventual National Champion, UConn.\nThe Spartans lost Adreian Payne (16.4 points and 7.3 rebounds per game) and Gary Harris (16.7 points per game) to the NBA draft and Keith Appling (11.2 points per game) to graduation (eventually to the NBA) following the season.\nOffseason.\n2014 recruiting class.\nTom Izzo again went big in recruiting for the 2014 season and again was shunned. Michigan State made offers to Cliff Alexander, Tyus Jones, Jahlil Okafor, and Tyler Ulis, but all went to other schools. As a result, MSU signed only one top 100 player, Lourawls Nairn, Jr. Analysts have argued that it is Izzo's unwillingness to cheat that has cost him some of these recruits.\nSeason summary.\nMichigan State was led by seniors Travis Trice (15.3 points and 5.1 assists per game) and Branden Dawson (11.9 points and 9.1 rebounds per game) and junior Denzel Valentine (14.5 points, 6.3 rebounds, and 4.3 assists per game). The Spartans started the season ranked No. 18 in the country.\nThe Spartans had two players transfer to the team. Eron Harris transferred from West Virginia. Under NCAA transfer rules, Harris had to redshirt for the 2014–15 season. Bryn Forbes transferred from Cleveland State. The NCAA granted Forbes a waiver due to family hardship that allowed Forbes to play immediately without having sit out a season.\nMSU began the season with a trip to play Navy in Annapolis, Maryland at the Naval Academy. The Spartans survived a scare to win a close game 64–59. The Spartans then traveled to Indianapolis, Indiana to participate in the Champions Classic, but were unable to outlast Duke (whom they would later meet in the Final Four), losing 81–71. MSU won their next four games, including wins over Santa Clara, Rider, and Marquette in the Orlando Classic. In the championship game of the Orlando Classic, the Spartans fell to No. 11 Kansas 61–56. Despite the loss, MSU moved up to No. 19 in the polls. In the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, MSU could not hold off Notre Dame, losing in overtime 79–78. Wins followed against smaller schools including Oakland and Eastern Michigan before MSU was shocked by Texas Southern at home in overtime. Following the loss, the Spartans went unranked the remainder of the season. They finished the non-conference season at 9–4.\nIn the Big Ten season, the Spartans were swept by Maryland and suffered bad losses to Nebraska, Illinois, and Minnesota in overtime. However, the Spartans rallied late in the season, winning six of their last eight conference games including a win over No. 23 Ohio State and wins at Michigan and at Illinois. MSU finished the season in a three-way tie for third place in conference. The Spartans finished the season with an overall record of 21–10, 12–6 in the Big Ten regular season. The Spartans got hot in the Big Ten tournament beating Ohio State and No. 8 Maryland. They challenged No. 6 Wisconsin for the tournament title, eventually losing the Big Ten tournament Championship in overtime.\nThe Spartans received an at-large bid in the NCAA tournament as a No. 7 seed in the East Region. The bid was MSU's 18th straight trip to the NCAA Tournament. MSU beat Georgia in the First Round and surprised No. 2-seeded and No. 6-ranked Virginia in the Second Round. With the win, the Spartans advanced to their fourth straight Sweet Sixteen and seventh Sweet Sixteen in eight years. In the Sweet Sixteen, they faced No. 3-seeded and No. 13-ranked Oklahoma. MSU defeated Oklahoma by four. Valentine scored 18 points and Trice contributed 24. The win sent MSU to the Elite Eight for the second consecutive year and their fourth trip since 2009. Louisville awaited the Spartans in the Elite Eight. The Spartans were pushed to overtime, but again came up with the victory, earning a trip to their seventh Final Four under Tom Izzo. Trice was named the Regional's MVP. In the Final Four, the Spartans fell to the eventual National Champions for the second straight season, losing a rematch of their Champions Classic game to Duke in the National Semifinal.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten regular season\n!colspan=9 style=|Big Ten tournament\n!colspan=9 style=|NCAA tournament"

Quarterfinal games were played at home team campus sites, while the 'final four' games were played at the Boston Arena in Boston, Massachusetts. By reaching the championship game Clarkson was indeed invited to participate in the 1966 NCAA University Division Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. As runner-up, Cornell received the second bid to the tournament, however, due to a disagreement between the Ivy League and the NCAA on postseason participation the Big Red declined the invitation and were replaced by Boston University.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play, all of which were single-elimination. The top eight teams, based on conference rankings, qualified to participate in the tournament. In the quarterfinals the first seed and eighth seed, the second seed and seventh seed, the third seed and sixth seed and the fourth seed and fifth seed played against one another. In the semifinals, the winner of the first and eighth matchup played the winner of the fourth and fifth matchup while the other two remaining teams played with the winners advancing to the championship game and the losers advancing to the third place game.\nConference standings.\n\"Note: GP = Games played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; Pct. = Winning percentage; GF = Goals for; GA = Goals against\""

        "text": "Joseph Charles Golding (born October 15, 1975) is an American basketball coach and former player. He is currently the head men's basketball coach at the University of Texas at El Paso, having previously served in the same capacity at Abilene Christian University, where he played point guard from 1994 to 1998.\nEarly years.\nGolding grew up in Midland, Texas, before relocating with his family as a teenager to Wichita Falls, Texas, where he graduated from Wichita Falls High School. He then played varsity basketball at Abilene Christian, earning four letters from 1994 to 1998, and graduated from ACU in 1999.\nCoaching career.\nThe beginning of Golding's career was spent at the high school and junior college levels, with assistant coaching positions at South Garland High School, Seminole State College and Collin College. His first head coaching job came in 2002 when, at age 27, he was hired to lead the program at Sachse High School.\nIn 2005, he was hired as an assistant coach at his alma mater, Abilene Christian, spending three seasons with the Wildcats before joining the coaching staff under Steve Shields at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock in 2008. During his final season in Little Rock, Golding helped lead the Trojans to a championship in the Sun Belt Conference tournament and a berth in the 2011 NCAA tournament.\nAbilene Christian.\nGolding's first head coaching job was at his alma mater, when he was hired to lead the program at Abilene Christian in 2011 at age 36. The difficulty of his first two losing seasons with the Wildcats in the Division II Lone Star Conference was compounded when ACU accepted an invitation to join the Southland Conference and make the transition to playing NCAA Division I basketball.\nAfter the transition to Division I, Golding and the Wildcats endured four more losing seasons before making their first postseason appearance with a berth in the CIT following the 2017–2018 season. The next year, the Wildcats won 27 games, captured the title at the Southland Conference tournament and earned the school's first-ever invitation to the NCAA tournament, where they lost to Kentucky in the first round.\nWhile the Wildcats' second consecutive 20-win season in 2019–20 did not produce a postseason appearance because of the COVID-19 pandemic, they returned to the Big Dance in 2021 by winning their second Southland Conference tournament title. As the 14th seed in the East Regional, ACU entered the 2021 NCAA tournament as a heavy underdog in the first round against 3rd-seeded Texas, who had just won the Big 12 Conference tournament. Utilizing a stifling defense that forced 23 turnovers, the Wildcats shocked the Longhorns, 53–52. It was the school's first-ever NCAA Tournament victory and the first win for a 14-seed since 2016. The Wildcats' season concluded two days later, when they were defeated by eventual Final Four participant UCLA in the second round.\nUTEP.\nOn April 14, 2021, Golding was officially introduced as the 20th head men's basketball coach at UTEP in a press conference held at the Don Haskins Center in El Paso.\nFamily.\nGolding's grandfather and great-uncle were brothers, both named Joe Golding, who each left their own athletic legacy. His grandfather, Joseph Lester Golding, was a longtime high school football coach who led Wichita Falls High to four state championships. The field at Wichita Falls' Memorial Stadium was named in his honor and he was posthumously elected to the Texas High School Football Hall of Fame in 1988. His great-uncle, Joseph Griffith Golding, was an All-American halfback at Oklahoma in 1946 before playing for five seasons in the NFL. His sister, Kate, is married to current TCU football coach Sonny Dykes. He and his wife, Amanda, have two sons named Chase and Cason Golding.\nHead coaching record.\n "

        "text": "The 2014–15 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Bruins were led by second-year head coach Steve Alford and played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members in the Pac-12 Conference. The team featured two All-Pac-12 performers in Norman Powell and Kevon Looney. Although the freshman Looney was seen as a potential NBA lottery pick, the senior Powell became the Bruins' most consistent performer. After numerous non-conference losses to start the season, UCLA finished in fourth place (11–7) in the Pac-12. They earned a No. 11 seed in the NCAA tournament, and advanced to the Sweet 16, becoming the lowest-seed UCLA team to ever reach the regional semifinals. The program produced its 49th 20-win season.\nThe Bruins began the season 4–0 and ranked No. 22 before losing two of three games at the Battle 4 Atlantis tournament. According to some pundits, the Bruins had the toughest non-conference schedule in the Pac-12. However, it did not net any signature wins, losing to ranked North Carolina, Gonzaga, and Kentucky. Beginning with their December loss at home to Gonzaga, the Bruins lost five consecutive games, their longest streak since 2009–10. Losses included a 39-point defeat to No. 1 Kentucky—they fell behind 24–0 and trailed 41–7 at halftime—and by 32 points against Utah. After Gonzaga, UCLA went 25 days without a home game, the longest in the school's history since 1972–73. They recovered to win eight of their next 11. After getting swept in a road trip to Arizona, UCLA closed out the regular season with three straight home wins to finish undefeated (9–0) at home in the conference for the first time since 2006–07. However, UCLA had few wins against notable teams during the season, and experts widely predicted that they needed a strong performance in the Pac-12 tournament to qualify for the NCAA tournament. The Bruins went 1–1, and were eliminated by Arizona. Although they were 0–2 for the season against the Wildcats, both games were competitive until the end.\nProving most major projections wrong, UCLA received an invite to the NCAA tournament, earning a No. 11 seed. Selection committee chairman Scott Barnes cited the Bruins' strength of schedule and improved play, even in their tournament loss to Arizona, as factors in their inclusion. In the Bruins' opener, Bryce Alford was credited with the game-winning three-point field goal after a goaltending call with 13 seconds remaining in a 60–59 win over sixth-seeded SMU. He finished with a game-high 27 points and made 9 of 11 three-point attempts. They advanced to the Sweet 16, where they lost again to Gonzaga, 74–62.\nPrevious season.\nThe UCLA Bruins finished the season with a record of 28–9 after advancing to the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. At the Pac-12 Conference tournament, the Bruins defeated the Arizona Wildcats 75–71 for the tournament championship. Kyle Anderson was voted the tournament's Most Outstanding Player after scoring 21 points and grabbing 15 rebounds in the championship game. The Bruins advanced to the Sweet 16 of the 2014 NCAA tournament—their first regional semifinal appearance since 2008—before falling to Florida, who improved to 4–0 all-time against UCLA in the NCAA tournament.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#; color:#;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#;\"| Pac-12 Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#;\"| NCAA tournament\nAwards and honors.\nPac-12 Conference Player of the Week\nAll-Pac-12 Teams\nUSBWA All-District IX Team \nNABC All-District 20 Team\nUCLA Team Awards"

        "title": "Latin Heat Rugby League",
        "text": "The Latin Heat Rugby League is a multi-national rugby league team focused on providing people of Central and South American residency or heritage a chance to play international rugby league and also help kick-start competitions in each individual Central and South American nation. Latin Heat was initially formed from Australian-based Latinos, but has since expanded to incorporate players from across Latin America, USA, UK and New Zealand.\nHistory.\nConcept.\nThe individual who founded the Latin Heat league was an Australian named Robert Burgin, who was inspired by his personal experience. One of Burgin's best friends in childhood was an Argentinian, Maurizio Merollini, and together they watched Argentina win the 1986 FIFA World Cup and the Argentinian Pumas contest the 1987 Rugby World Cup. Burgin then wondered why Argentina did not play rugby league, his favourite sport. During the 1990s and 2000s, Burgin would remain involved in the Australian rugby league scene.\nIn 2008 Burgin quit working for the Queensland Rugby League and took the first of six backpacking trips to Latin America; his first trip included Mexico, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Colombia. His second trip included Peru, Bolivia, Chile (including Easter Island), Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil. During both these early trips he was profoundly influenced by the culture and believed the people would love the sport of rugby league, were it to be introduced. On his third trip to South America in 2012, during a thunderstorm which lasted several days, he showed rugby league videos to Brazilians in the city of Assis Chateuabriand, Parana, who seemed excited by the sport; from there, Burgin believed the sport could be seriously grown in Latin America.\nFormation.\nIn July 2013, back in Australia, Burgin wrote to Rugby League International Federation development officer Tas Baitieri and expressed his interest in helping to develop the sport for Central and South America. He was then put in touch with two other people who had expressed similar ideas - Matthew Brown, a contributor for Rugby League Planet website, and Rafael Attili, a Brazilian from São Paulo who had previously lived in New Zealand.\nOn a coaching course that year, Burgin met an NRL Development Officer, Daniel Sarmiento, who he later found out was Colombian-born and fluent in Spanish. Together they started holding training sessions at Wests Mitchelton Rugby League Football Club for Brisbane's Latino community.\nAfter Attili had to withdraw from further contribution due to rugby union commitments, Burgin, Brown and Sarmiento became the three main figures in the foundation of Latin Heat, and are now commonly credited as the three co-founders.\nThe attendees at the Latin Heat's first training session were Burgin, Sarmiento and two Colombian players - Fernando Villegas and Diego Lopez Pinto.\nGraphic designer Joshua Collins designed the original Latin Heat logo and the foundation sponsors were Guzman y Gomez Mexican Tacquerias, Rumba Latina and Gringo Magazine.\nThe Latin Heat made their debut in a small suburban 9-a-side tournament at Wests Mitchelton in Brisbane on 21 September 2013. Due to more than half the team withdrawing on the eve of the game, the first squad included a lot of non-Latin players; however, six players who played in the tournament were of Latino heritage - Sarmiento, Villegas, Alex Moreno, Josh Gadea-Hellyer, Alejandro Zota Balvin and an Australian-born, Colombian-raised son of missionaries Leighton Johannesen.\nThe Latin Heat experienced their first international match on the Gold Coast on 18 January 2014 in front of approximately 1500 people. They lost to the Philippines 114–0; however, this was their first full-blooded 13-a-side match and the full 17 players were of Latin American heritage, with most not having any previous experience in the sport.\nThey then entered the Cabramatta International Nines in Sydney on 2 February 2014. Former USA Tomahawk and 2013 World Cup participant Kristian Freed was a guest player for the Latin Heat squad in the tournament.\nAfter losses to the Philippines and Portugal, they recorded their first international victory against Japan 22–8. They were eliminated, however, against the Greek national side 18–0 in the quarterfinals.\nIn June 2014 they played against the Thailand Stars, which ended in a 16-all draw after prop Jonathan Espinoza missed a penalty goal from in front during the final minutes at Windsor Sporting Complex in front of a 500-strong crowd. Chilean-born Ernie Tobar was the head coach of the team for the Thailand fixture.\nThe Latin Heat not only improved on the field, but also improved their profile in the public as well. They appeared in various newspapers and news websites in Sydney and Brisbane and also on the NRL, Fox Sports and Courier Mail websites. One Latin Heat player (Brandon Tobar) won Try of the Week on Channel 9's \"The Footy Show\" while playing for Penrith Juniors.\nAfter coach Ernie Tobar stepped aside due to family commitments, Argentinian-born Gabe Keegan became head coach of the Heat.\nThe team welcomed an influx of highly-influential players around the same time, including 130 kg Sean Day (from the Olarte family in Peru), 125 kg Eduardo Wegener (Chilean heritage) and former Guyana Commonwealth Games representative Kevin McKenzie (born in Guyana).\nAfter again participating in the Wests Mitchelton Nines without much success, Latin Heat took on Portugal at Woolahra Oval in Sydney in October 2014 and won 40–6. The team dedicated the victory to Grace Chacone, mother of influential player Grantito Chacone, who had passed away in the weeks before the game.\nIn 2015 in a rematch against the Philippines at Bishop Park, Nundah in Brisbane, the Philippines won 80–4, with Jacob Giuliano scoring the sole try for the Heat.\nMore players of Latin heritage have been identified for the team in New South Wales, Queensland, Perth, and Melbourne.\n2014 squad.\nThe following list comprises players who are in the Latin Heat representative squad for the 2014 season.\nResults.\n21 September 2013 – Mitchelton Nines, Brisbane: Latin Heat lost to Mitchelton Two 16-30 / Latin Heat lost to University of Queensland 10-36 / Latin Heat lost to Aspley 6-30 / Latin Heat lost to Mitchelton One 14–18)\n18 January 2014 – Test versus Philippines, Runaway Bay: Latin Heat lost to Philippines Tamaraws 0–114.\n1 February 2014 – Cabramatta International Nines, Sydney: Latin Heat lost to Portugal 6-18 / Latin Heat lost to Philippines Three 10-12 / Latin Heat defeated Japan 22-8 / Latin Heat lost to Greece 0-20.\n1 June 2014 - Test versus Thailand, Windsor, NSW: Latin Heat drew with Thailand 16-16.\nBenefits of the team and international exposure.\nAlthough an Australian-based organisation, the Latin Heat have helped promote rugby league to Central and South America. Both their international games against Philippines and Thailand were broadcast over the internet live. These were watched by people in Australia and in Central and South America. The team also has connections in several Central and South American nations such as Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and El Salvador, where there are efforts to help kick-start rugby league in each nation.\nMexico has started up rugby league and has a stable domestic competition consisting of four teams and 80 players. The Latin Heat has helped increase Mexico Rugby League's international presence through social media and raising the profile of their organisation.\nThe Latin Heat brand has also expanded to the United States. This is an important move because over 52 million Americans are of Latin American heritage, which is not only beneficial for the Latin Heat team, but for international rugby league as well.\nThe Latin Heat are also attempting to send 1000 rugby league balls to key cities across South America in Spanish and Portuguese through the company Kickstarter. This is to help individuals in each nation who do not know rugby league to learn the game.\nThe team has also allowed players of Latin American origin to reconnect with their heritage. Players such as Jye Sommers, (captain of the Latin Heat and of Peruvian heritage) said that the Latin Heat has allowed him to appreciate and express his Latin American heritage.\nAs of 2015 Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Peru and Uruguay have all been able to field standalone teams in sevens or nines tournaments."

The flame envelops the body of the torch rather than exiting from a hole on the top, like earlier torches. A dynamic, innovative shape was created to develop this concept, which recalls the tip of a ski but also the building that is a symbol of Turin, the Mole Antonelliana.

        "text": "Rugby Cement was the common name for a company based principally in Rugby, Warwickshire, which produced portland cement. With its origins in the early 19th century, the company was founded in 1862 as the Rugby Lias Lime &amp; Cement Company Ltd before being renamed the Rugby Portland Cement Company Ltd in 1872, in 1979 it was renamed the Rugby Group plc. In 2000 Rugby Cement was taken over by the RMC Group, which was itself taken over by the Mexican firm Cemex in 2005. Cement production still continues at the New Bilton site in Rugby under Cemex ownership.\nHistory.\nThe business was first started in 1825 as a small family business by two local businessmen Thomas Walker and his son George Walker when they started producing lime mortar at a site on their land at New Bilton and nearby Newbold-on-Avon, exploiting locally available deposits of what Professor H.B. Woodward described in 1898 as \"the finest inland section of lower lias limestone in the country\".\nThe first public company the \"Rugby Lias Lime &amp; Cement Company Ltd\" was founded in 1862. In around 1870 the company began producing portland cement, and the company was renamed the \"Rugby Portland Cement Company Ltd.\" in 1872.\nThe next milestone in the company's history occurred in 1933 when Sir Halford Reddish became the managing director of the company. The company began to expand its activities, acquiring four plants at nearby Southam in 1934, Rochester in 1937, Gillingham in 1939, and Stockton in 1945. The first two were rebuilt and modernised with the latest technology, but the latter two were soon closed down as they competed with the Southam and Rochester plants.\nIn 1955, the company founded an Australian subsidiary, Cockburn Cement Ltd, in Perth, Australia, which was later merged in 1999 into Adelaide Brighton Cement.\nIn 1965 a 92 km pipeline was opened to transport chalk as slurry from Kensworth Chalk Pit, Bedfordshire to the Rugby plant.\nBy the 1980s the company branched out from its Portland cement base to offer a wider variety of cement types, including sulfate-resistant cements, cements for the offshore oil industry, and quick-drying cements.\nIn 1984 the company bought the Addison Corporation of Atlanta, Georgia, thus entering the American construction market, and also saw it enter the joinery market.\nIn the late 1990s, the plant at Rugby was upgraded at a cost of £200 million to a production capacity of 1.8 million tonnes. At the same time the plants at Southam and Rochester were closed down as production was concentrated at Rugby."

He represented Gloucester on two occasions in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. On 21 June 2015 it was announced that he would leave Gloucester to join their rivals Exeter Chiefs. In the 2019 Premiership final he scored a try as Exeter were defeated by Saracens. The following year Hill started in both the Premiership and European Rugby Champions Cup finals as Exeter defeated Wasps and Racing 92 to complete a League and European double.\nIn December 2021, it was announced that Hill will be joining Sale Sharks for the 2022 season.\nInternational.\nHill represented the England under-20 team twice during the 2014 Six Nations Under 20s Championship and was selected for the 2014 IRB Junior World Championship however an ankle injury prevented his involvement.\nHill was selected in England's 34 man squad for their 2018 summer tour of South Africa and was an unused substitute in the third and final Test. On 31 October 2020 he made his England debut, pairing with Maro Itoje in the second row, in England's delayed final Six Nations match away to Italy, which England won to become the 2020 Six Nations champions. In December 2020 Hill came off the bench for England as they defeated France in extra-time to win the Autumn Nations Cup.

He did not participate in any of the Test series but did score a try in a tour match against the Stormers.\nIn a match against the Wallabies on 2 July 2022, Hill was given a Yellow Card for pulling the hair of his opponent lock Darcy Swain. He was lucky to escape further sanctions by the citing committee despite hair pulling being illegal according to the World Rugby rule book, with one commentator remarking that he \"better keep his suit fresh\", implying a likely judicial hearing. The Wallabies went on to win the match, scoring multiple tries and gaining the lead while Hill was serving his Yellow Card. He was labelled an \"English villain\" in the Australian press as a result of the incident.\nHonours.\nEngland\nClub"

She has also worked with FSN.\nEarly life.\nMurphy was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. She kept to her Chicago roots and attended Northwestern University from 1977 to 1980, acting as a two-year captain for the women's basketball team. During her senior season, Murphy was a finalist for the Wade Trophy as one of the top players in the nation.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from college, Murphy served as a student graduate assistant at the University of Notre Dame for three seasons while earning a master's degree in business administration. She then moved to Notre Dame as an assistant coach for two year. Murphy was hired as head coach at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1986. In 1992 she led the Badgers to their first NCAA Tournament appearance, compiling a 20-9 overall record and a 13-5 conference record in the Big Ten. Over eight seasons Murphy compiled an 87-135 record at Wisconsin. Her time at Wisconsin was not without controversy. At least one player sued Murphy claiming she had caused her emotional harm and caused her to leave the team. The charges were eventually dropped by the courts. After leaving Wisconsin, Murphy became the head coach at Cal State Hayward from 1995 to 1996.\nMurphy left college coaching to become the first head coach and the general manager of the WNBA's Sacramento Monarchs in 1997. Murphy would coach the team for the first 15 games, compiling a 5-10 record, before being fired in the midst of a 5-game losing streak that dropped the Monarchs from first to third in their division.\nBroadcasting.\nUpon being let go by the Monarchs, Murphy was hired by Brian Donlon, Lifetime Television's vice president of sports and executive producer, to be part of its WNBA broadcast team along with Michele Tafoya and Reggie Miller. Murphy started with her own halftime feature, \"Murphy's Law\" before joining Miller and Tafoya as a game analyst. When Lifetime ended its WNBA broadcasts in 1999, Murphy moved to ESPN for women's NCAA tournament games and WNBA broadcasts while FOX would bring her on board to call the Pac-12 women's games on FSN in the early 2000s. Others would follow suit. In 2007 Murphy was hired as one of BTN's announcers, and in 2012 she was hired as an analyst for Pac-12 Network. Today Murphy continues to act as an analyst for first round NCAA women's tournament games on ESPN, girls high school championship broadcasts on Comcast, Monday Night's BTN game of the week, select Pac-12 games, and as color analyst for the Los Angeles Sparks on Spectrum SportsNet."

He has served as head coach of the Carolina Hurricanes and Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL), Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), as well as the Canada men's national ice hockey team.\nEarly life and career.\nPeters was born in Three Hills, Alberta, where he spent the first ten years of his life living on a cattle and grain farm. He then moved \nto Killam, where he began playing both ice hockey and baseball. At age 15, Peters broke his knee when he was run over on his bicycle by a car, an injury that hindered his intention to play professionally. He played two seasons for the Augustana Vikings, and one for the Red Deer College Kings, during which he won the 1989 Alberta Colleges Athletics Conference championship under future mentor Mike Babcock. After this, he began his managerial career coaching Killam's Junior B team at age 24 before moving to Texas for his wife's nursing job. Peters helped open San Antonio's first ice hockey rink, and held hockey schools every summer across the United States and Canada. He also played his only game as a professional in Texas as a last-minute replacement in 1996 for the Central Hockey League's San Antonio Iguanas.\nCoaching career.\nEarly career.\nPeters began his career during the 1989–90 season with his hometown Killam Wheat Kings as head coach.

Nicknamed the \"Maroons\", after the colour of their jersey, the team compete in the annual Women's State of Origin game against arch-rivals New South Wales. Coached by Tahnee Norris and captained by Ali Brigginshaw, the team is administered by the Queensland Rugby League.\nUntil 2017, the team competed in the Women's Interstate Challenge before the game was rebranded as State of Origin in 2018. From 1999 to 2015, the Maroons went on an unprecedented 17-year undefeated streak.\nHistory.\nIn 1999, Queensland played New South Wales for the first time at Brisbane's ANZ Stadium, with the Maroons' winning 18–16. The win started an undefeated streak that would last for 17 years. The team were originally nicknamed the \"Brolgas\".\nIn 2015, Queensland failed to defeat New South Wales for the first time, drawing with them 4–all at Townsville's 1300SMILES Stadium.\nIn 2016, New South Wales defeated Queensland for the first time, winning 8–4 at Cbus Super Stadium.\nIn 2018, the Women's Interstate Challenge was rebranded as State of Origin. On 22 June 2018, New South Wales won the first game under the State of Origin banner, defeating Queensland 16–10 at North Sydney Oval. In 2020, Queensland won their first game under the Origin banner, defeating New South Wales 24–18.\nOn 23 March 2021, Tahnee Norris, who played 13 interstate games for Queensland, was announced as new head coach of the side.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that the one fixture in 2022 would be played at Canberra Stadium on 24 June, and that from 2023 onwards, two Women's State of Origin matches would be played each season.\nPlayers.\nPrior to 2019, the Queensland and New South Wales teams were largely selected under residency rules, meaning a number of players represented both states. Tahnee Norris, who captained Queensland, and Natalie Dwyer, both represented New South Wales before moving to Queensland, while Tarah Westera represented Queensland before moving south.\nIn 2019, the eligibility rules were revised to be more inline with the men's State of Origin rules. The residency rule was removed, which saw New Zealand representatives Maitua Feterika (Queensland) and Nita Maynard (New South Wales) ruled ineligible. Rona Peters was also ruled ineligible as she had previously represented New Zealand. This was later overturned and she was given special dispensation, as she had retired from international rugby league in 2015, before she first represented Queensland in 2016. \nCurrent squad.\nSquad for the two-match series on 1 and 22 June 2023.&lt;br&gt;On 15 May 2023, the QRL announced a squad of 18 players for the first match of the series.

        "text": "Alejandro Villanueva Martín (born September 22, 1988) is a Spanish-American former professional football player who was an offensive tackle for eight seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Army Black Knights and fulfilled his service commitment after graduation, where he reached the rank of captain. Villanueva also served in the 75th Ranger Regiment, earning a Bronze Star. After serving three tours of duty in Afghanistan, he signed a contract with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2014, but was waived prior to the season. He then signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers and played for them for six seasons until signing with the Baltimore Ravens in 2021 for his final season.\nEarly life.\nVillanueva was born on Naval Air Station Meridian in Meridian, Mississippi, to Ignacio Villanueva, a Spanish Naval officer who worked for NATO, and his Spanish wife Matilde Martín. Both his mother and father are over tall. Alejandro is the eldest of the family's four children, including siblings Carmen, Iñaki and Paloma.\nDuring his childhood, he lived in Rhode Island, Spain, and Belgium. In Spain he learned to play rugby, which, for a time, he preferred to football, which he began to play in Belgium. It was while he was attending SHAPE High School in Casteau, Belgium that he was recruited to play American football. Villanueva's childhood friend whom he'd met at SHAPE was recruited to play football for the Army Black Knights and his friend told the Army coaches about Villanueva. They kept in touch and Villanueva told him that he was considering attending West Point, where he later enrolled.\nHis brother Iñaki Villanueva is a professional rugby union player. He plays with the Spain national rugby union team and with the sevens team. He was in the squad that qualified for the 2016 Olympics, and he played in the Olympic tournament.\nCollege career.\nVillanueva played college football for the Army Black Knights at several positions, including left tackle, defensive lineman, and wide receiver. Though originally recruited as a tight end, he played defensive end during his freshman season, mostly on special teams. In his sophomore season offensive line coach John Tice lobbied to have Villanueva converted to an offensive tackle which occurred near the end of his sophomore year. By his junior season he started every game at left tackle. Voted a team captain before his senior year, he reluctantly converted once more to become a wide receiver; a feature story in the Army football program read, \"Already touted as the tallest football player in the country, Villanueva completed the transformation from being an offensive lineman for the past two years, to running routes on the field with the starting offense last Saturday night.\" His height, while reported by Army Football in 2009 to be , was given by the Philadelphia Eagles in 2014 as .\nProfessional career.\nTryouts.\nAlthough he went undrafted in the 2010 NFL draft, he received a tryout with the Cincinnati Bengals as a tight end, but did not make the team and went back into military service. Two years later, he made a second attempt to play in the NFL as a tight end. He was given a tryout and practiced with the Chicago Bears, but was not signed. After finishing his last tour with the 75th Ranger Regiment, Villanueva decided to pursue his NFL career again and began working out at Savannah State University. In March 2014, he paid $245 to attend a regional NFL combine in Flowery Branch, Georgia. During this time, the NFL held 10 regional combines nationwide and had over 3,000 prospects attend. In April 2014, he was one of 240 prospects invited to the NFL super regional combine in Detroit and met with representatives from the Philadelphia Eagles.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nOn May 5, 2014, he was signed to the Philadelphia Eagles for an undisclosed contract to play as a defensive end. His signing marked the second time the Eagles had signed a military veteran in recent years, having previously had Chad Hall, a wide receiver from the Air Force, as a member of the team. Villanueva said that if he did not make an NFL roster, he planned to serve a fourth tour of duty in Afghanistan. He commented, \"I see this as a win-win situation. Obviously, I'm trying to get to a team and contribute. But if I can't, then I can't wait to get back to the Army and serve in the same manner that I have.\" During training camp, Villanueva gained , noting that he is eating a consistent diet, which contrasted with his military career insofar as while in the military, he often did not have time or inclination to eat, whereas with the Eagles, he was getting \"plenty to eat\". It was announced on August 23 that he was one of 14 players cut from the team.\nPittsburgh Steelers.\nOn August 21, 2014, during a pre-season game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Villanueva was spotted by Steelers' head coach Mike Tomlin, who was impressed with his size and athleticism. Eight days after he was waived by the Philadelphia Eagles, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to their practice squad on August 31, 2014. Upon joining his new team, he was immediately changed from a defensive end to an offensive tackle, as it was thought to better suit him. As a defensive end for the Eagles, Villanueva weighed 250 lb. Within a year of becoming an offensive tackle, he rose up to 340 lb.\nThroughout the 2014 season, Villanueva was kept on the practice squad to learn the position, put on more weight, and develop his abilities.\n2015.\nOn January 6, 2015, the Pittsburgh Steelers signed him to a two-year, $960,000 reserve/futures contract. He was able to get reps in training camp and preseason as the second-team swing tackle, after Mike Adams suffered an injury. With Adams unable to recover before the regular season, Villanueva was slated as the Steelers' swing tackle to begin the 2015 season. He made his debut during the 2015 season opener against the New England Patriots, playing five snaps as an extra tackle on goal-line plays. He also appeared on special teams and played a few plays at tight end during this period.\nOn October 18, 2015, Villanueva received his first opportunity at left tackle against the Arizona Cardinals after starting left tackle Kelvin Beachum left the game with a torn ACL.\nThe following week, Villanueva received his first career start at offensive tackle since his sophomore year at Army in 2008 and was tasked with blocking Kansas City Chiefs Pro-Bowl defensive end, Tamba Hali. He allowed a strip sack in the fourth quarter, which aided the Chiefs in defeating the Steelers. With Beachum out for the remainder of the season, Villanueva continued to play left tackle and started the last 12 games of the Steelers' season, including two playoffs games. In his first season as a starter, he was ranked the 48th best offensive tackle by Pro Football Focus with an overall grade of 47.5. He surrendered 39 pressures on 459 pass blocking snaps and ranked as the 11th-worst offensive tackle in pass blocking efficiency with a grade of 93.2 by PFF.\n2016.\nVillanueva was named the starting left tackle position to begin the 2016 season after Kelvin Beachum left via free agency and after outperforming Ryan Harris in training camp. Villanueva struggled early on in the season and surrendered five sacks in the first six games of the season. His run blocking and pass protection greatly improved after Week 7 and he only allowed one sack in the last ten games, helping the Pittsburgh Steelers reach the playoffs. He finished the season ranking as the 23rd best offensive tackle in the league after receiving an 82.4 overall grade from Pro Football Focus. Including the three playoff games, Villanueva allowed 46 pressures and was penalized eight times in 19 starts with 26 of those pressures and five penalties coming in the first six regular season games. From Week 11 to the AFC Championship, he performed well enough to rank as the best offensive tackle in that span.\n2017.\nOn July 27, 2017, Villanueva signed a four-year, $24 million contract extension with the Steelers. Villanueva was credited with creating an audible that included the phrase \"Dilly Dilly\" from a Bud Light television commercial, that quarterback Ben Roethlisberger later used in a live game. On December 19, 2017, Villanueva was named to his first Pro Bowl along with fellow Steeler offensive linemen David DeCastro and Maurkice Pouncey. He became the first service academy graduate to play in the Pro Bowl since Roger Staubach in 1979. Villanueva started all 16 games in received an overall grade of 74.3 from Pro Football Focus. His grade ranked him 24th among all offensive tackles in the NFL.\nNational anthem controversy.\nOn September 24, 2017, prior to a game against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field, the Steelers did not take the field for the national anthem in order to avoid getting caught up in the controversy related to players kneeling or displaying other signs of racial protest around the NFL started by Colin Kaepernick.\nVillanueva was the lone member of the Steelers to appear publicly for the national anthem, standing in front of the entrance tunnel for the performance while the rest of the team remained in the tunnel. Head coach Mike Tomlin stated a wish to simply play the game and not allow for any show of support one way or the other on the issue. Likely as a result of this, Villanueva's jersey became the top selling jersey on the NFL's official store in the 24-hour period after Sunday's games started. The move caught some of his teammates and coach Tomlin by surprise. Later, Villanueva apologized for his appearance saying, \"I see that picture of me standing by myself and I'm embarrassed to a degree, because unintentionally I left my teammates behind.\" At a press conference the day after, he said, \"Unfortunately, I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally...Every single time I see that picture of me, standing by myself, I feel embarrassed.\"\nIn additional comments, he said, \"It wasn't me stepping forward. I never planned to boycott the plan that the Steelers came up with. I just thought there would be some middle ground where I could stand in the tunnel, nobody would see me.\"\n2018.\nOn November 25, 2018, Villanueva caught his first career touchdown pass on a fake field goal from Chris Boswell at the end of the first half in a game against the Denver Broncos.\nHe received an overall grade of 78.1 from Pro Football Focus in 2018, which ranked as the 12th highest grade among all qualifying offensive tackles.\n2020.\nOn September 28, 2020, Villanueva taped Sergeant First Class Alwyn Cashe's name on the back of his helmet, covering the name of Antwon Rose Jr, who was killed by an East Pittsburgh police officer in June 2018 after being involved in a drive-by shooting. Cashe was a US Army non-commissioned officer posthumously awarded the Silver Star ( Later upgraded to the Congressional Medal Of Honor) in 2005 for actions he took in Operation Iraqi Freedom to rescue soldiers from a burning vehicle, during which time he sustained burns over 75% of his body and ultimately succumbed to his injuries. The Steelers team had previously decided to honor Rose. Villanueva stated his actions were intended to support the campaign to upgrade Cashe's award for valor from the Silver Star to the Medal of Honor.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn May 4, 2021, Villanueva signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Baltimore Ravens.\nRetirement.\nOn March 9, 2022, Villanueva announced his retirement from the NFL.\nMilitary career.\nAfter graduating from the United States Military Academy, Villanueva was commissioned into the United States Army on May 22, 2010, as a second lieutenant in the Infantry.&lt;ref name=\"Eagles/army\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Directly after being commissioned he attended various military schools, including the Infantry, Airborne, and Ranger Schools; all located at Fort Benning, Georgia.

His roles within the Battalion have included plans officer, platoon leader, and company executive officer.\nHe has deployed two more times to Afghanistan for a total of eight months between both deployments. In 2015, Villanueva left the army when downsizing efforts meant he would have to wait 18 months for a command position that would last less than 12 months.\nPersonal life.\nVillanueva has spoken publicly about the importance of his Catholic faith in his life and work. In November 2013, he married Madelyn Muldoon in a small ceremony in her parents' backyard. He met her through her brother, Joe Muldoon, with whom he played football at Army, and the two began dating in the spring of 2012. On May 9, 2015, Alejandro and Madelyn had a larger ceremony at the Jesus the Divine Word Catholic Church in Huntingtown, Maryland.\nIn the fall of 2015, Villanueva enrolled in Carnegie Mellon University's Tepper School of Business to earn a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree.

She represented Germany in two editions of the Olympic Games (2004 and 2008), and also often played as a midfielder and an experienced central defender. Bachmann was also a member of the Germany women's national field hockey team who attained a great success in the mid and late 2000s, capturing three gold medals at the 2004 Summer Olympics, 2006 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy, and 2007 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship.\nCareer.\nBachmann started playing field hockey at the age of five under the influence of her father Hans-Gerd Bachmann, a former player for the West German team and 1978 EuroHockey Nations champion. Bachmann began training for the junior squad at HTC Uhlenhorst Mülheim, until she joined the Club Raffelberg Duisburg in 1996. Four years later, she was officially selected to the women's senior national team, and eventually competed in numerous field hockey tournaments across Germany and the rest of Europe. From 2004 to 2008, Bachmann played for Eintracht Braunschweig hockey club. From 2009 to 2014, she played for Dutch club Oranje Zwart.\nBachmann made her official debut at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, where she competed as a member of the German squad in the women's field hockey tournament. Collecting a total of two triumphs, two losses, and six classification points in the group stage, Bachmann helped her squad defeat China in the semifinals through a penalty knock-out, and later, scored a goal of 2–1 to upset the daunting Dutch team for her nation's first ever gold medal in Olympic sporting history.\nAdding to a laundry list of her accomplishments, Bachmann continued a winning streak for the Germans by taking home two more golds in the women's tournament at the 2006 Women's Hockey Champions Trophy in Amstelveen, Netherlands, and at the 2007 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship in Manchester, England.\nAt the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Bachmann qualified for the second time as a member of the German squad and defending champion in the women's field hockey tournament after receiving an automatic berth from the EuroHockey Nations Championships. Unlike the previous Games, she and the rest of the German squad could not capitalize on their last chance for a penalty corner at the final second, and were defeated in the semifinal match against China with a set score of 2–3. In the bronze medal final, Bachmann and her teammates shortened their chances of a medal, as the Germans lost the match to World No. 2 Argentina with a score of 1–3.\nBachmann continued to compete for the German women's senior team until she temporarily retired in 2010. Three years later, she sought her sights to return to the team after being called for its configuration by new coach Jamilon Mülders. On that same year, at the 2013 Women's EuroHockey Nations Championship in Boom, Belgium, Bachmann reclaimed her status in the international hockey stage, as she and the Germans outclassed the Brits for a gold medal through a penalty shootout and a thrilling 4–4 draw in their first final after 22 years. In addition to the prestigious EuroHockey trophy, Bachmann had been elected as the Best Player of the Tournament.\nSince 2014, Bachmann is the head coach of the men's team of Uhlenhorster HC."

        "text": "The 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2014–15 season. They began on April 15, 2015, and ended on June 15, 2015, with the Chicago Blackhawks defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning four games to two in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe New York Rangers made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. They also came back from a 3–1 series deficit for the second consecutive year. The Detroit Red Wings increased their consecutive post-season appearance streak to 24 seasons, the longest current streak at the time and tied for the fourth-longest streak in NHL history. The Winnipeg Jets qualified for the playoffs for the first time since the former Atlanta Thrashers franchise relocated to Winnipeg in 2011; the only time that the Thrashers/Jets franchise made the post-season was in 2007, and the last time that the city of Winnipeg hosted a playoff game was in 1996, the season before the previous Winnipeg Jets team relocated to Phoenix, Arizona, to become the Coyotes. The Ottawa Senators became the first team in the NHL's modern era (since 1942–43) to overcome a 14-point deficit in the standings to clinch a playoff spot. Also, the Calgary Flames returned to the playoffs after a six-year absence. In total, five Canadian NHL teams qualified for the post-season, the most since 2004.\nThe Los Angeles Kings became the first defending Stanley Cup champions since the Carolina Hurricanes in 2007 to fail to make the playoffs. The Boston Bruins failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2007 and became the first reigning Presidents' Trophy winners to miss the post-season since the Buffalo Sabres in 2008 (and the third overall). In addition, the San Jose Sharks failed to make the post-season for the first time since 2003, ending the NHL's second-longest active playoff streak.\nFor the first time since 2000, both the Eastern and Western Conference finals went the full seven games.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning became the first team in league history to face an Original Six team in all four rounds of the playoffs in the same year, as they played against the Detroit Red Wings, Montreal Canadiens, New York Rangers and Chicago Blackhawks, respectively. They also became the fourth team to defeat three consecutive Original Six teams.\nThe Lightning also tied the 1987 Philadelphia Flyers, 2004 Calgary Flames and 2014 Los Angeles Kings for playing the most playoff games (26) in a postseason (later matched by the 2019 St. Louis Blues), all four currently hold the record under a four-round playoff format. The record was subsequently broken by the Dallas Stars during the expanded 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the second year in which the top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the First Round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other two teams from the divisions played against each other, with the second-placed team having home-ice advantage. In the first two rounds, home-ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed; in the last two rounds, it was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (WC1) Ottawa Senators.\nThe Montreal Canadiens finished first in the Atlantic division, earning 110 points. The Ottawa Senators finished as the Eastern Conference's first wild-card, earning 99 points. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams; their only previous meeting was in the 2013 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Ottawa won in five games. Ottawa won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Canadiens won the first three games of the series en route to defeating the Senators in six games. In game one, Brian Flynn scored the game-winning goal at 17:17 of the second period, and recorded two assists as the Canadiens won 4–3. Montreal's P. K. Subban was given a five-minute major and a game misconduct for slashing Ottawa's Mark Stone during the second period, resulting in a microfracture of Stone's right wrist, but did not face any further League discipline. Alex Galchenyuk's goal at 3:40 into overtime gave the Canadiens a 3–2 win in game two. Cameron replaced Andrew Hammond with Craig Anderson as his starting goalie for game three, but Dale Weise tied the game with 5:47 left in the third period, then scored at 3:40 into overtime to give Montreal a 2–1 win. Anderson rebounded in game four, stopping all 28 Montreal shots while Mike Hoffman scored the Senators' only goal to win 1–0. Ottawa then took game five by a score of 5–1 as Anderson stopped 45 of 46 shots, and Bobby Ryan scored two goals. The Canadiens then eliminated the Senators in Game 6 2–0 as goaltender Carey Price stopped all 43 of Ottawa's shots.\n(A2) Tampa Bay Lightning vs. (A3) Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Tampa Bay Lightning finished second in the Atlantic Division, earning 108 points. The Detroit Red Wings earned 100 points in the regular season to finish third in the Atlantic. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Tampa Bay won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Red Wings in seven games. Detroit goalie Petr Mrazek made 44 saves and Pavel Datsyuk recorded a goal and assist in a 3–2 win in game one. Tampa Bay took game two, 5–1, scoring four goals on 18 shots against Mrazek, including two from Tyler Johnson. Mrazek rebounded in game three, stopping all 22 shots in a 3–0 victory. In game four, the Lightning came back from a 2–0 third-period deficit to tie the game after Johnson and Ondrej Palat scored 1:17 apart. Johnson then scored at 2:25 of overtime for a 3–2 Tampa Bay win. Mrazek then recorded another shutout in game five, stopping 28 shots in a 4–0 win. In game six, Johnson scored two goals as the Lightning built a 3–0 second-period lead en route to a 5–2 victory. Although he was not penalized during game six, Detroit's Niklas Kronwall was later suspended one game by the NHL for charging Tampa Bay's Nikita Kucherov late in the second period. In game seven, Lightning goaltender Ben Bishop stopped all of Detroit's 31 shots, Braydon Coburn scored what proved to be the game-winning goal 3:58 into the third period and Anton Stralman scored the empty netter with 1:18 remaining in the game to give Tampa Bay a 2–0 victory.\n(M1) New York Rangers vs. (WC2) Pittsburgh Penguins.\nThe New York Rangers earned the Presidents' Trophy as the NHL's best regular season team, earning 113 points. The Pittsburgh Penguins finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild-card, earning 98 points. This was the sixth playoff meeting between these teams, with Pittsburgh having won four of the five previous series. Their most recent meeting was in the previous year's Eastern Conference Second Round, which New York won in seven games. New York won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Rangers defeated the Penguins in five games. In game one, Derick Brassard and Ryan McDonagh each had goals, while goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stopped 24 out of 25 shots, to help give the Rangers a 2–1 victory. In game two, Sidney Crosby scored two goals in a span of 4:39 to help give Pittsburgh a 3–1 second-period lead, en route to a 4–3 win. The Rangers took game three, 2–1, as they held the Penguins to just 11 shots on goal through the first and second periods, and Lundqvist made 12 out of 13 saves in the third. Rookie centre Kevin Hayes then scored the game-winning goal 3:14 into overtime of game four to give the Rangers another 2–1 victory. The Rangers then recorded a third consecutive 2–1 victory in game five, with Carl Hagelin scoring 10:52 into overtime, to take the series. Hagelin became the first Ranger to accomplish this feat since Stephane Matteau scored a goal in game seven against the New Jersey Devils in 1994. The Penguins were eliminated in the first round for the first time since 2012.\n(M2) Washington Capitals vs. (M3) New York Islanders.\nBoth the Washington Capitals and the New York Islanders finished tied for second in the Metropolitan Division with 101 points, but Washington was awarded home-ice advantage by winning the head-to-head points tie-breaker (6–5). This was the seventh playoff meeting between these teams, with New York having won five of the six previous series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1993 Patrick Division semifinals, which New York won in six games. The teams split the four-game regular season series, with each team winning twice at home.\nThe Capitals defeated the Islanders in seven games. The Islanders took game one, 4–1, led by Brock Nelson's two goals, and Josh Bailey's goal and an assist. In game two, Washington came back from a 3–1 second-period deficit to score three unanswered goals to win, 4–3, despite being forced to start rookie goalie Philipp Grubauer in this match in place of an ill Braden Holtby. Games three and four ended in overtime: John Tavares scored 15 seconds into the extra period to give the Islanders a 2–1 victory in Game 3, and Nicklas Backstrom's goal 11:09 into overtime gave the Capitals a 2–1 victory in game four. Washington then controlled game five with a 5–1 victory, led by Evgeny Kuznetsov's two goals and an assist. The Islanders then took Game 6, 3–1, as Nikolay Kulemin scored at 10:33 of the third period to break a 1–1 tie, and Cal Clutterbuck added an empty netter. Game six proved to be the last playoff game that the Islanders played at Nassau Coliseum (until 2019) before moving full-time to the Barclays Center for three seasons, as Washington's Evgeny Kuznetsov scored the game-winning goal 12:42 into the third period of game seven to help give the Capitals the victory, 2–1.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) St. Louis Blues vs. (WC1) Minnesota Wild.\nThe St. Louis Blues finished first in the Central Division, earning 109 points. The Minnesota Wild finished as the Western Conference's first wild-card, earning 100 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. The teams split the four-game regular season series, with each team winning once at home and once on the road.\nThe Wild defeated the Blues in six games.

The Chicago Blackhawks earned 102 points during the regular season to finish third in the Central Division. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams; their only previous meeting was in the 2010 Western Conference quarterfinals, which Chicago won in six games. Chicago won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Blackhawks defeated the Predators in six games. In game one, Nashville scored three-straight first period goals on Chicago goaltender Corey Crawford, prompting Blackhawks Head Coach Joel Quenneville to put backup Scott Darling in net. Chicago then rallied, scoring three-straight second period goals to tie the game before Duncan Keith scored 7:49 into double overtime to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 victory. Crawford again started in game two, but the Predators scored four unanswered goals on him, including two goals from Craig Smith, to tie the series with a 6–2 win. Darling was named the starter for game three and then stopped 35 Nashville shots, while Chicago scored three second-period goals to grab a 4–2 win. Game four ended at 1:00 into triple overtime when Brent Seabrook's one-timer from the blue line went past Nashville goalie Pekka Rinne into the net, giving the Blackhawks a 3–2 victory.

In game six, Quenneville pulled Darling after giving up three first period goals on 12 Nashville shots. Chicago then rallied behind Crawford, with Keith scoring the game-winning goal 16:12 into the third period to give the Blackhawks a 4–3 win and the series.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (WC2) Winnipeg Jets.\nThe Anaheim Ducks finished first in the Pacific Division, earning 109 points. The Winnipeg Jets finished as the Western Conference's second wild-card, earning 99 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Anaheim won all three games in the regular season series. This series also marked the first appearance of a team representing Winnipeg in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 19 years, as the Jets made the playoffs for the first time since moving from Atlanta, and for the second time in franchise history since their only playoff appearance in 2007 when they were swept in the conference quarterfinals, leaving them entering the 2014–15 season as the only NHL franchise to never record a post-season win. The most recent team to represent Winnipeg prior to this was the original Winnipeg Jets, who lost in the Western Conference quarterfinals in 1996.\nThe Ducks won each of the first three games with third-period comebacks en route to sweeping the series against the Jets. Down 2–1 in the third period of game one, Corey Perry scored twice, Ryan Getzlaf scored once and Sami Vatanen scored once to help give Anaheim a 4–2 win.

The Calgary Flames earned 97 points during the regular season to finish third in the Pacific Division. This was the seventh playoff meeting between these teams with Calgary having won four of the six previous series.

The teams split the four-game regular season series, with each team winning once at home and once on the road.\nThe Flames defeated the Canucks in six games. Calgary rallied from a one-goal deficit in game one, as David Jones tied the game 7:59 into the third and Kris Russell scored the winning goal with 29.6 seconds left to give the Flames a 2–1 win. The Canucks tied the series with a 4–1 win, as goalie Eddie Lack made 22 out of 23 saves and Alex Burrows recorded two assists. With 1:17 left to play, a fight broke out that resulted in 132 penalty minutes, with the Flames' Deryk Engelland given a game misconduct for instigating it, but eventually the league rescinded Engelland's penalty and instead fined Calgary head coach Bob Hartley $50,000 for his responsibility for the incident. Jonas Hiller made 23 saves to help give the Flames a 4–2 win in game three. In game four, Calgary scored three first-period goals out of seven shots off of Lack. Ryan Miller replaced Lack to start the second period, but Hiller made 28 total saves en route to a 3–1 win. Miller then made 20 saves and Daniel Sedin scored the winning goal 1:47 into the third period to help give the Canucks a 2–1 win in Game five. In game six, Hartley pulled Hiller after he allowed two goals on his first three shots, and put Karri Ramo in net. The Flames tied the game in the second period, and then Matt Stajan scored what proved to be the game-winning goal late in the third period. Two empty net goals in the final minute of the game sealed the series victory for the Flames.\nSecond round.\nEastern Conference second round.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (A2) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the third playoff meeting for these teams; the teams had split their two previous playoff series. Their most recent meeting was in the previous year's Eastern Conference First Round, in which Montreal swept Tampa Bay out of the playoffs. Tampa Bay won all five games in the regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Canadiens in six games. In game one, Nikita Kucherov scored 2:06 into double overtime to give Tampa Bay a 2–1 win. This winning goal was controversial because the Lightning appeared to have been offside on the play, but nothing was called by the linesmen. Earlier at 2:56 of the first overtime period, Kucherov's apparent winning goal was waved off after officials ruled that he pushed Carey Price's pad into the net after the Montreal goalie made the initial save. The Lightning also won game two, 6–2, scoring four power play goals. Montreal's Brandon Prust was then fined $5,000 for his postgame derogatory public comments directed toward Referee Brad Watson, which he later apologized for the day afterward. In game three, Tyler Johnson scored with 1.1 seconds left to give Tampa Bay a 2–1 victory. The Canadiens stayed alive in game four, as Max Pacioretty recorded a shorthanded goal and two assists, as Montreal built a 5–0 second-period lead en route to a 6–2 win. Then in game five, P.A. Parenteau scored with 4:07 left in regulation to give the Canadiens a 2–1 victory. In game six, Ben Bishop stopped 18 of 19 Montreal shots, and Kucherov scored two goals, as Tampa Bay won 4–1 to take the series.\n(M1) New York Rangers vs. (M2) Washington Capitals.\nThis was the ninth playoff meeting for these teams, and their fifth in the last seven years; the teams have split their eight previous playoff series. Their most recent meeting was in the 2013 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which New York won in seven games. New York won three of the four games in the regular season series.\nThe Rangers overcame a 3–1 series deficit to eliminate the Capitals in seven games. Joel Ward scored with 1.3 seconds left to give Washington a 2–1 win in game one. The Rangers took game two, 3–2, as Chris Kreider and Dan Boyle recorded first-period goals and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 30 out of 32 shots. In game three, Braden Holtby stopped all of the Rangers' 30 shots, and Jay Beagle's second-period goal helped give the Capitals a 1–0 win. Holtby then made 29 out of 30 saves in game four, while rookie Andre Burakovsky scored his first two postseason goals in a 2–1 victory for Washington. In game five, the Capitals appeared to have scored the icebreaker with 2:09 left in the second period when Matt Niskanen's shot went past Lundqvist, but officials waved off the goal and ruled that Ward interfered with the Rangers goalie. Curtis Glencross would later score the icebreaker for Washington at 10:54 of the third period. But Kreider scored with 1:41 remaining in regulation to tie the game, 1–1, then Ryan McDonagh won it at 9:37 into overtime to give the Rangers a 2–1 victory. Game six saw Kreider score two first-period goals to help the Rangers build a 4–1 lead in the third period before holding off a late comeback by the Capitals to win 4–3. Then in game seven, Derek Stepan scored at 11:24 into overtime on a set play off the faceoff to give the Rangers a 2–1 victory and the 4–3 series win to move on to the Eastern Conference Final for the second time in as many years. This was also the second consecutive playoffs in which the Rangers were able to overcome a 3–1 series deficit, an NHL first. As well, this was only the second time the Rangers overcame a 3–1 series deficit in franchise history, as well as the second series in NHL playoffs history to comprise seven games decided by a one-goal margin, after the Capitals' upset of the Bruins in the first round of the 2012 playoffs. With this series loss, the Capitals fell to 6–5 all-time in series when they lead 3–1, with this fifth loss becoming most among NHL teams.\nWestern Conference second round.\n(C3) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (WC1) Minnesota Wild.\nThis was the third year in a row in which the Blackhawks and Wild had met in the postseason, and their third meeting overall. The Blackhawks won both previous series, their most recent meeting was in the previous year's Western Conference Second Round where Chicago won in six games. Chicago won three of the five games in the regular season series.\nThe Blackhawks swept the Wild. In game one, after Chicago scored three unanswered first-period goals, followed by Minnesota scoring three of their own to tie the game, Teuvo Teravainen scored with 59 seconds left in the second period to help give the Blackhawks a 4–3 win. Patrick Kane then scored two goals in game two to help give Chicago a 4–1 victory. In game three, Corey Crawford stopped all of Minnesota's 30 shots, and Kane's power play goal in the first period helped give the Blackhawks a 1–0 win. Chicago then won game four, 4–3, with four different Blackhawks recording goals, but had to hold off an attempted comeback by Minnesota, who scored two goals 51 seconds apart in the final minutes of the game.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (P3) Calgary Flames.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these teams; their only previous meeting was in the 2006 Western Conference quarterfinals, which Anaheim won in seven games. Anaheim won three of the five games in the regular season series.\nThe Ducks eliminated the Flames in five games. Anaheim took game one, 6–1, scoring three goals apiece against both Calgary starting goalie Jonas Hiller and backup Karri Ramo. Flames coach Bob Hartley then decided to start Ramo for the rest of the series. In game two, Ducks goalie Frederik Andersen stopped all of Calgary's 30 shots in a 3–0 victory. In game three, Anaheim held a 3–2 lead in the third period when Sam Bennett appeared to have tied the game with 6:22 left in regulation, but officials said no goal on the ice and video review ruled that it was inconclusive as to whether the puck completely crossed the goal line. However, with 19.5 seconds remaining in regulation, and the Flames on essentially a 5-on-3 advantage because of pulling their goalie for an extra attacker, coincidental minors against both teams, and a delay of game penalty on Sami Vatanen of Anaheim, Johnny Gaudreau scored to tie the game. Then at 4:24 of overtime, Mikael Backlund scored his first postseason goal on a delayed penalty to give Calgary the win, 4–3. The Ducks responded with a 4–2 win in game four, as a high-sticking double minor penalty on Calgary's Joe Colborne at the end of the second period led to Matt Beleskey's power play goal to give Anaheim a 3–2 lead, followed by Patrick Maroon's empty netter. In game five, Corey Perry scored 2:26 into overtime, giving the Ducks the series win.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(M1) New York Rangers vs. (A2) Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these teams. This was the Rangers' second consecutive Conference finals appearance, and their third overall in the last four years; they defeated the Montreal Canadiens in six games in the previous year. Tampa Bay most recently made it to the conference finals in 2011, where they lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. Tampa Bay won all three games in the regular season series.\nThe Lightning defeated the Rangers in seven games. In game one, Dominic Moore scored with 2:25 left to give the Rangers a 2–1 win. Tyler Johnson then recorded a hat trick, scoring a shorthanded, a power play and an even strength goal, as he led the Lightning to a 6–2 victory in game two. In game three, Nikita Kucherov scored 3:33 into overtime to give Tampa Bay a 6–5 win. The Rangers then responded with a 5–1 win in game four, as Rick Nash scored twice and Henrik Lundqvist stopped 38 out of 39 shots. Ben Bishop shut out the Rangers in game five, stopping all 26 shots in the Lightning's 2–0 win. In game six, Derick Brassard recorded a hat trick and two assists as the Rangers went on to win, 7–3. Game seven, however, saw Tampa Bay record another 2–0 victory to eliminate the Rangers — the first time the Rangers had lost a game seven at home in their history (and the first time they lost an elimination game at home since the 2007 playoffs) — as Bishop stopped all 22 New York shots while the Lightning scored two goals out of their first three third-period shots.\nWestern Conference final.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (C3) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these teams. Anaheim most recently made it to the conference finals in 2007, when they defeated the Detroit Red Wings in six games. This was Chicago's third consecutive Conference finals appearance, and their fifth overall in the last seven years; they were defeated by the Los Angeles Kings in seven games in the previous year. Chicago won two of the three games in the regular season series.\nThe Blackhawks eliminated the Ducks in seven games. Anaheim took game one, 4–1, getting goals from four different players and Frederik Andersen stopping 26 out of 27 shots. Game two was the longest game in Chicago franchise history as Marcus Kruger scored 16:12 into triple-overtime to give the Blackhawks a 3–2 victory. Anaheim defeated Chicago in game three, 2–1, as Simon Despres' first career Stanley Cup playoff goal with 55 seconds left in the second period proved to be the difference. In game four, a total of six goals were scored during the third period. After the period began with a 1–1 tie, the Blackhawks scored two consecutive goals, followed by the Ducks scoring three in 37 seconds, before Patrick Kane's power play goal tied it again at 4–4. The contest ended when Antoine Vermette scored at 5:37 of double overtime to give Chicago a 5–4 victory. The Ducks built a 3–0 first period lead before Chicago scored two in the second to cut the score to 3–2. Patrick Maroon scored at 14:45 of the third period to increase Anaheim's lead to 4–2, but Jonathan Toews scored twice inside the final two minutes of regulation to tie the game and force overtime. This time, Matt Beleskey scored 45 seconds into the extra period to give the Ducks the 5–4 victory. But in game six, the Blackhawks built a 3–0 second-period lead, with Duncan Keith recording an assist in each of those three goals, en route to a 5–2 win. And in game seven, Toews scored twice as Chicago built a 4–0 second-period lead en route to a 5–3 victory.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Both teams won their last appearance in the Finals; Tampa Bay defeated Calgary in seven games in 2004, while Chicago defeated Boston in six games in 2013. This was the Lightning's second appearance in the Finals; the Blackhawks made their thirteenth Finals appearance, and their third in six years. Upon winning the Finals, Chicago had won three Stanley Cups in the past six years. This was also the first Stanley Cup Finals not to have a game go into overtime since 2009.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.\nGoaltenders.\nThis is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played. The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs were the first postseason under Rogers Media' 12-year contract for Canadian television and digital media rights to the NHL. On television, national coverage of playoff games were split between Sportsnet channels and CBC (through \"Hockey Night in Canada\"). French-language coverage of all games was carried by TVA Sports. Selected games were simulcast with Punjabi-language commentary on Omni Television.\nIn the United States, national coverage of playoff games aired on either NBC, NBCSN, CNBC, NHL Network, or USA Network. USA Network broadcast NHL games for the first time since they aired them from 1979 to 1985. During the first round, these national telecasts co-existed with those of regional rightsholders, after which NBC had exclusive rights to the remaining games. Seven first-round games were televised exclusively in the U.S. on NBC.\nIn Canada, first-round viewership improved over the previous season, with one of the games in the Montreal-Ottawa series on CBC seen by 3.76 million viewers. However, following the elimination of Canadian teams from contention and an all-U.S. final, ratings dropped significantly, with Numeris estimating an overall decrease of 8% in average viewership on CBC, and a 14% decrease in average viewership for Sportsnet in comparison to TSN's 2014 playoff coverage. Game six of the Final, facing competition from a Team Canada match in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup on CTV and TSN, and the Toronto Blue Jays (in the midst of a major winning streak) on Sportsnet, was the lowest-rated deciding game since game seven in 2003.\nBy contrast, ratings in the United States were strong for NBC and its cable networks. This also extended to the Montreal-Ottawa first-round series, where it faced no competition from a U.S. regional rightsholder: games six and three of the all-Canadian series on NBCSN ended up being the top and the second-most watched first-round contests on U.S. cable, respectively. Game seven of the N.Y. Rangers-Tampa Bay Eastern Conference finals produced a 2.65 metered market overnight rating, making it NBCSN's second-highest rated non-Final NHL game. Game seven of the Anaheim-Chicago Western Conference finals then generated a 3.27 metered market rating, the highest rated non-Final overnight NHL game on NBC. During the Final, game six was seen by 7.6 million viewers nationally on NBC. Ratings for game six were especially strong in Chicago and Tampa Bay: it was the most-watched NHL broadcast locally in Chicago history, and the second-highest in Tampa Bay. Overall, it was the second-most-watched Stanley Cup Finals since 1995, averaging a 3.2 rating and 5.6 million viewers on NBC and NBCSN, trailing only the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals."

        "text": "The 1912 Giro d'Italia was the fourth edition of Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours, and marked four years since the first race in 1909. The Giro featured 56 riders — all of Italian descent — on 14 cycling teams, starting in Milan on 19 May and finishing in Bergamo on 4 June.\nThe 1912 edition of the Giro d'Italia was unique in that the general classification was a point system that was based on teams rather than individuals as in years past. The organizers limited the entrance of the race to teams of four, which meant there were no independent riders like in previous editions. According to a \"La Stampa\" article, there were six professional teams, six \"incorraggiamento\" teams, and one military team. The professional teams were Bianchi, Peugeot, Senior, Gerbi, Atala, and Legnano. The \"incorraggiamento\" teams were Goerike, Soriani, Soc. Ramella, Favero, Bolgona, and Bergami, while the military team was Stucchi. Each team wore specific, unique colored jersey while racing each day. "

        "text": "The 2015 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) season, and the culmination of the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Western Conference champion Chicago Blackhawks defeated the Eastern Conference champion Tampa Bay Lightning four games to two to win their sixth championship in franchise history, and their third title in six seasons.\nThe Lightning, as the club with the better regular-season record, held home-ice advantage in the series. The best-of-seven series was played in a 2–2–1–1–1 format, with Tampa Bay hosting Game 1, 2, and 5; and Chicago hosting Games 3, 4, and 6. Tampa Bay would have hosted Game 7 had it been needed. The series started June 3 and ended on June 15.\nTyler Johnson and Patrick Kane led the Stanley Cup playoffs in points scored with 23 points each.\nPaths to the Finals.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nThis was Tampa Bay's second Finals appearance after winning the Cup in . Since their win in 2004, the Lightning had lost in the Conference Finals in 2011 in seven games to the Boston Bruins. The Lightning were eliminated in the first round in 2006, 2007, and 2014.\nThe Lightning entered the 2014–15 season with major re-signings during the offseason including centre Tyler Johnson, wingers Ryan Callahan and Ondrej Palat, and goalie Ben Bishop. In free agency, Tampa Bay picked up centre Brian Boyle and defenceman Anton Stralman from the New York Rangers and Brenden Morrow from the St. Louis Blues. The team made two trades to bolster the defence, picking up Jason Garrison at the 2014 draft and Braydon Coburn just before the 2015 trade deadline.\nTampa Bay compiled 108 points (50–24–8) during the regular season to finish in second place in the Atlantic Division. Centre and team captain Steven Stamkos finished second in goal-scoring during the regular season with 43 goals. Earlier in the season, Head Coach Jon Cooper nicknamed the team's second line of Johnson, Palat and winger Nikita Kucherov as the \"Triplets\" because they were so in sync; at the mid-season in January, the three players led the League in plus-minus.\nIn the playoffs, the Lightning eliminated the Detroit Red Wings in seven games, the Montreal Canadiens in six games, and the New York Rangers in the Conference Finals in seven games. They became the first post-1967 expansion team to beat three Original Six teams on the way to the Stanley Cup Finals and the only team in NHL history to face an Original Six team at every stage of the playoffs.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nThe Finals marked Chicago's third Final appearance in six seasons; having won the Cup in both and . This was the team's 13th appearance overall, and they were seeking their sixth overall Cup championship.\nThe Blackhawks entered the 2014 offseason after being eliminated in the Conference Finals in seven games by the eventual Cup champion Los Angeles Kings. Major free agent acquisitions during the offseason included centre Brad Richards and winger Daniel Carcillo from the Rangers. Approaching the NHL trade deadline in early March, Chicago traded for defenceman Kimmo Timonen from the Philadelphia Flyers, centre Antoine Vermette from the Arizona Coyotes, and centre Andrew Desjardins from the San Jose Sharks.\nChicago finished in third place in the Central Division, earning 102 points (48–28–6). Goalie Corey Crawford tied the Canadiens' Carey Price as the William M. Jennings Trophy recipient for allowing a league-low 189 goals during the regular season.\nIn the playoffs, the Blackhawks eliminated the Nashville Predators in six games, swept the Minnesota Wild, and defeated the Anaheim Ducks in the Conference Finals in seven games. They became the only team in NHL history to face a post-1990 expansion team at every stage of the playoffs.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nIn Game 1, Tampa Bay struck first with a deflected goal by Alex Killorn at 4:31 in the first period. The Lightning nursed the lead into the third period with a strong conservative defensive effort, but Teuvo Teräväinen and Antoine Vermette scored 118 seconds apart to win the game 2–1 for the Blackhawks. By assisting on Vermette's goal, Teravainen became the second-youngest player (at 20 years and 265 days) in NHL history, after Jaromír Jágr had two assists in Game 1 of the Finals (on May 15, 1991, at 19 years and 89 days), to have a multi-point game in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame 2.\nJason Garrison's power play goal at 8:49 of the third period proved to be the difference in Tampa Bay's victory in Game 2. Lightning starting goaltender Ben Bishop had left the game moments earlier for reasons that were undisclosed at the time, but was later revealed to be a torn groin. He was replaced with Andrei Vasilevskiy who was credited with his first playoff victory. He also became the first goalie to win a Stanley Cup Finals game in relief of an injured starter since Lester Patrick helped the New York Rangers defeat the Montreal Maroons in overtime of Game 2 of the 1928 Stanley Cup Finals, 2–1.\nGame 3.\nThe series moved to Chicago for Game 3. There was some debate who would start for Tampa Bay, but regular starter Ben Bishop started the game for Tampa Bay. For the third time in a row, Tampa Bay struck first, on Ryan Callahan's slapshot goal at 5:09 of the first. Brad Richards tied it up on a power-play goal and the teams were tied after the first period. The first period was dominated by Chicago, who outshot Tampa Bay 19–7. The second period was dominated by Tampa Bay, which outshot Chicago 17–7, but there was no scoring. In the third period, Brandon Saad gave Chicago its first lead at 4:14, but Tampa Bay countered on the next shift on a goal by Ondrej Palat to tie the score once again. Late in the third period, Victor Hedman led a rush down ice for Tampa Bay and passed to Cédric Paquette who scored to put the Lightning ahead again. The Lightning were able to defend their lead to win the game 3–2 and take a series lead two games to one.\nGame 4.\nThe Lightning chose to rest injured goaltender Ben Bishop for Game 4 in favor of rookie Andrei Vasilevskiy. The Lightning protected Vasilevskiy with tight defensive play, allowing only two shots by the Blackhawks in the first period, which was scoreless. For the first time in the series, the Blackhawks scored the first goal, on a goal by Jonathan Toews at 6:40 of the second. Alex Killorn tied it for the Lightning at 11:47 and the game was tied 1–1 after two periods. In the third, the Blackhawks' Brandon Saad muscled his way to the goal and scored on a backhand past Vasilevskiy at 6:22 to put the Blackhawks ahead. The game's pace picked up as the Lightning tried to tie the score but the Blackhawks goaltender Corey Crawford made several outstanding saves to shut out Tampa Bay the rest of the way. The win tied the series at two games apiece. It was the first time since that the first four Stanley Cup Finals games were all decided by one goal.\nGame 5.\nThe series returned to Tampa for Game 5 and Ben Bishop returned to the net for the Lightning. The Blackhawks scored first for the second consecutive game, this time on a miscue by Bishop and Lightning defenceman Victor Hedman. The two collided and Patrick Sharp skated to the empty net with the puck, scoring at 6:11 of the first, a lead they held until 10:53 of the second when Valtteri Filppula scored to tie the score 1–1. The teams were tied going into the third, but Antoine Vermette scored for the Blackhawks at 2:00 of third and the lead held up as the Blackhawks played tight defence the rest of the way. The Blackhawks took the lead in the series three games to two, to give themselves a chance to win the Cup at home, something the franchise has not done since . For the second time in Finals history and the first since , wherein all five games that had to be played went to overtime, all games of the series through Game 5 have been decided by one goal, with neither team leading by more than one goal.\nGame 6.\nIn Game 6, the teams were scoreless after the first period. In the first period, Steven Stamkos put a shot off the crossbar and was stopped on a breakaway early in the second by Corey Crawford but it was the Blackhawks who scored first on a goal by Duncan Keith on a rebound of his own shot near the end of the second period to put Chicago ahead 1–0 after two periods. In the third period, the Blackhawks' Patrick Kane scored on a pass from Brad Richards and play by Brandon Saad to put the 'Hawks ahead 2–0, the first two-goal lead of the series. The Blackhawks then frustrated the Lightning the rest of the way to win the game 2–0, a shutout for Crawford and the Stanley Cup championship. It was revealed after the game that the Lightning's goaltender Ben Bishop had played with a torn groin muscle since Game 2 and Tyler Johnson was playing with a fractured wrist, injured in Game 1. This was also the first time since 1938, when they beat the Toronto Maple Leafs in the fourth game of a best-of-five Finals at Chicago Stadium, and the first time at the United Center that the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup on home ice.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2015 Stanley Cup was presented to Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Blackhawks' 2–0 win over the Lightning in Game 6. \nThe following Blackhawks players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2014–15 Chicago Blackhawks\nTelevision.\nIn the U.S., the Finals were split between NBC and NBCSN, called by NBC Sports' lead commentary team of Mike Emrick, Eddie Olczyk, and Pierre McGuire; it was originally announced that games two and three were to be broadcast by NBCSN, with the rest on NBC. Game 2 was moved to NBC to serve as a lead-out for its coverage of the 2015 Belmont Stakes in favor of Game 4 on NBCSN. As Olczyk was also a contributor to NBC's Belmont coverage, he missed Game 2.\nIn Canada, all six games were broadcast by CBC Television (through \"Hockey Night in Canada\", as produced by Sportsnet through a brokerage agreement) in English, TVA Sports in French, and Omni Television in Punjabi. These were the first Stanley Cup Finals under Rogers Communications' exclusive national broadcast rights to the NHL in Canada.\nThis was the second-most watched Stanley Cup Finals on U.S. television since 1995, trailing only the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals, with an average 3.2 Nielsen rating and 5.6 million viewers on NBC and NBCSN. Game 6 was seen by 7.6 million viewers nationally on NBC. Ratings for Game 6 were especially strong in Chicago and Tampa Bay: it was the most-watched NHL broadcast locally in Chicago history, and the second-highest in Tampa Bay. By contrast, ratings in Canada dropped significantly, making it the lowest-rated Stanley Cup Finals since 2009. Game 6, facing competition from a Team Canada match in the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, and the Toronto Blue Jays (which had seen increased ratings due to a long winning streak), was the lowest-rated deciding NHL playoff game on Canadian television since the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals."

        "title": "List of riders with stage wins at all three cycling Grand Tours",
        "text": "The Grand Tours are the three most prestigious multi-week stage races in professional road bicycle racing. The competitions are the Giro d'Italia, Tour de France and Vuelta a España, contested annually in that order. They are the only stage races permitted to last longer than 14 days.\nThe Giro d'Italia, Tour de France, and Vuelta a España are collectively known as the Grand Tours of cycling. The oldest of the races, the Tour, began in 1903, while the Giro first started in 1909 and the Vuelta in 1935. The modern editions of the races all consist of 21 days of racing with two rest days spread throughout race calendar, giving riders at most 63 chances to win a stage in a Grand Tour each year.\nWinning a stage in a Grand Tour is a significant achievement and winning a stage in each Grand Tour is a rare feat that only 107 riders have achieved in their careers. Fiorenzo Magni was the first rider to win a stage in each Grand Tour with his victory in the stage 7 individual time trial at the 1955 Vuelta a España. The most recent rider to accomplish this task was Lennard Kämna after he won stage 9 of the 2023 Vuelta a España.\nCyclists are ranked on the basis of their total stage wins in the three Grand Tours. When there is a tie between cyclists they are listed alphabetically. The majority of stage winners across the three tours have come from Europe, however, there have been a few non-European cyclists who have accomplished this feat. Colombian Luis Herrera was the first non-European rider to win a stage in each of the Grand Tours when he completed the triple with his victory in stage 13 at the 1989 Giro d'Italia. The first North American to complete this feat is Tyler Hamilton. American Tyler Farrar became the only other North American to do so with his victory in stage 3 of the 2011 Tour de France. Simon Gerrans became the first person from the Southern Hemisphere to win a stage at each Grand Tour with his victory at the 2009 Vuelta a España in tenth leg. Djamolidine Abdoujaparov is the only Asian cyclist on the list.\nEddy Merckx, with 64 victories, has won the most stages at the Grand Tours. Mario Cipollini is second with 57, Mark Cavendish is third with 54. Merckx and Cavendish have won the most Tour stages with 34, while Cipollini leads the tally for career stage wins at the Giro d'Italia with 42 to his name. Delio Rodríguez has the most stage wins in the history of the Vuelta a España (39 stages) but he failed to win any stages in the Tour de France or Giro d'Italia and is thus not represented in this list.\nList.\nRiders in bold are still active.\nCalendar year.\nAn ever rarer accomplishment is to win a stage at all the Grand Tours in one single calendar year. This feat has only been accomplished by three riders in history. The first rider was Spain's Miguel Poblet who won a total of eight stages at all three Grand Tours in 1956. Two years later, Pierino Baffi won six stages between all three Grand Tours. The third, and most recent, rider was Italian cyclist Alessandro Petacchi who won fifteen stages at the Grand Tours in 2003.\nDoping.\nFour more riders (David Zabriskie, Jan Ullrich, Leonardo Piepoli and Alberto Contador) have won stages in all three Grand Tours, but all were retroactively stripped of stage wins."

        "text": "The National Association of Colored Baseball Clubs of the United States and Cuba was an early professional Negro baseball league that operated on the East Coast of the United States from 1907 to 1910.\nFounding.\nThe league, also called the National Association, was founded by H. Walter Schlichter of the Philadelphia Giants and the promoter Nat Strong. It originally had five member clubs: the Brooklyn Royal Giants, Cuban Giants, Cuban Stars of Havana, Cuban X-Giants, and Philadelphia Giants. Three of these clubs had been members of the multiracial International League of Independent Professional Base Ball Clubs in 1906, though there was apparently no other connection between the two leagues. The Cuban X-Giants folded before play started in 1907.\nAccording to newspaper reports, the National Association was \"modeled on the lines of the National and American League white clubs.\" Its organization \"was made necessary by the financial results of the season of 1906, when every owner of a colored ball club in this vicinity lost money, due to the exorbitant salaries paid to the players and the keen competition among the various clubs.\"\nThe chief aims of the league were \"to place colored baseball on a solid business basis and to protect both players and managers and prevent jumping from one club to another, on the slightest pretext, as was done this last season. It is intended to protect the managers from unscrupulous and unreliable managers of independent clubs who engage the colored clubs and unceremoniously cancel the dates at the last moment if so inclined.\"\nThe Philadelphia Giants won the first pennant in 1907. The Brooklyn Royal Giants were champions in 1908 and 1909. The league appears to have folded in 1910, and that year's champion is uncertain.\nName of league.\nAside from the National Association, this league was also referred to as the International League of Colored Baseball Clubs of America and Cuba or ILBCAC. Similar to the International League of Independent Professional Base Ball Clubs, it was also referred to as the International League. These casual references have led to the two leagues being confused for each other.\nTeams.\nInitially, the Cuban X-Giants were included in the league but folded prior to the inaugural 1907 season. The league's members were otherwise constant for its duration. The Cuban Giants and Cuban Stars were based in New York City at this time.\nChampions.\nComplete records are difficult to locate, but each season appeared to be around 15-30 league games per team, although some teams played only a handful of games. The following teams were declared colored champions:"

The park is situated at the northern end of Pacific Beach, a short distance south of where the sand beach ends and the rocky promontory of La Jolla begins. There are cliffs to the north and south of Tourmaline Surfing Park, but the park itself lies in Tourmaline Canyon, which cuts down through those cliffs to the beach.\nTourmaline Surfing Park is less than 1000 feet west of the point where Tourmaline Street crosses La Jolla Boulevard. Reaching the park involves a steep, palm-lined descent through Tourmaline Canyon to a fairly large parking lot, which is slightly elevated but situated right beside the beach. There are showers and restrooms, as well as railings and places to sit.\nHistory.\nIn the 1960s, the beach was a popular surfing spot, but ocean side property owners complained about the \"rowdy\" presence of the surfers. A town council tried to reconcile the parties by setting up a set of rules regarding surfing on the beach. The decision to create a delimited surf park finally made its way and was completed in 1965 (inaugural date May 25th, 1965). Surf clubs also emerged in the area with members encouraging other surfers to respect the beaches and their surroundings.\nTourmaline Memorial.\nTourmaline Surfing Park also features \"Tourmaline Memorial\" a monument celebrating surfers who have enjoyed the surf at Tourmaline, in the past and the present, including Skeeter Malcolm.\nAlthough surfers have surfed the area since the 1930s, Tourmaline Surfing Park first opened in May 1963; the idea for the memorial was conceived in 2006, and the memorial itself was completed in 2008. The motto is \"Surf Well, Spread Aloha, Share Waves Without Judgment\".\nTourmaline was the country's first surf park.\nList of honorees.\nThe list of honorees on the memorial is as follows:"

The event was won by Sebastian Kienle of Germany and Australia's Mirinda Carfrae. It was the 38th edition of the Ironman World Championship, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978, with an additional race in 1982. The championship was organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) and awarded a total purse prize of $650,000.\nQualification.\nFor entry into the 2014 World Championship race, amateur athletes were required to qualify through a performance at an Ironman or selected Ironman 70.3 series race. Entry into the championship race could also be obtained through a random allocation lottery, through Ironman's Legacy program, or through the Ironman’s charitable eBay auction. The division of athletes is divided into professional, age group, physically challenged, and hand cycle divisions.\nFor professional triathletes, a point system determines which professional triathletes qualify for the championship race. To qualify, points are earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2014 championship race that period was August 31, 2013 to August 24, 2014. The top 50 male and top 35 female pros in points at the end of the qualifying year qualified to race in Kona. An athlete's five highest scoring races were counted in the point totals. At least one Ironman race must have been completed and only three Ironman 70.3 races counted towards an athlete's overall point total. Prior champions of a WTC Championship receive an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they competed in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year. Their entry does not count toward the number of available qualifying spots. Available prize money to professional triathletes for qualifying race ranged from $25,000 to $125,000.\nThe 2014 Ironman series consisted of 29 Ironman races plus the 2013 Ironman World Championship which was itself a qualifier for the 2014 Championship.\nDisabled.\nRacing driver and paracyclist Alex Zanardi completed the 2014 Ironman World Championship in a time of 9:47:14, ranking 272nd overall and 19th out of 247 in the 45- to 49-year-old age group category.

        "title": "UEFA Nations League",
        "text": "The UEFA Nations League is a biennial international football competition played by the senior men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA, the sport's European governing body.\nThe first tournament began in September 2018. The four group winners from League A qualified for the finals, played in Portugal in June 2019. The competition replaces the international friendly matches previously played on the FIFA International Match Calendar, with European national teams engaging in more frequent competitive matches against other European national teams of comparable level.\nAdoption.\nIn October 2013, Norwegian Football Association President Yngve Hallén confirmed that talks had been held to create a third full national-team international tournament for UEFA members in addition to the FIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championship.\nThe concept of the UEFA Nations League would see all of UEFA's member associations' national teams divided into a series of groups based upon a ranking formulated using their recent results, where they would be promoted and relegated to other groups according to their results within the group. The proposed tournament would take place on dates on the FIFA International Match Calendar that were previously allocated for international friendlies and would not affect the FIFA World Cup or UEFA European Championship.\nIn March 2014, UEFA general secretary Gianni Infantino stated that one of the benefits of the proposal would be to help less glamorous national associations arrange games.\nThe Royal Belgian Football Association's general secretary, Steven Martens, said that lower-ranked nations would still benefit financially from the competition, as the television contract with UEFA would be centralised. The UEFA Nations League was unanimously adopted by the 54 UEFA member associations at the XXXVIII Ordinary UEFA Congress in Astana on 27 March 2014.\nFormat.\nOriginal format.\nAccording to the approved format, the 54 UEFA national teams were divided into four divisions (called \"Leagues\"): 12 teams in League A, 12 teams in League B, 14 teams in League C, and 16 teams in League D. In each league, four groups were formed (with three or four teams) and teams played each other both home and away.\nAdjustment starting from 2020–21.\nAfter the completion of the first season, UEFA decided to adjust the format of the Nations League starting from the 2020–21 season. The new league structure comprised 16 teams in Leagues A, B, and C and seven teams in League D.\nThe transition to the new format occurred by making various one-time changes after the 2018–19 season, namely the suspension of relegations in both League A and League B, the promotion of the two best teams per group in both League C and League D (instead of only one team per group), and the promotion of the best third-placed team from League D.\nThis change to the format followed a collective consultation process, whereby all UEFA national associations reiterated their intent to further reduce the number of friendly matches. The number of competitive matches was increased from 142 to 168, thus increasing the commercial value and viewer appeal of the competition. Almost all teams in the same group played their last match simultaneously with the aim of promoting fairness. More matches were played within Leagues A and B, with the two leagues now incorporating competition between the 32 highest-ranked UEFA national associations, instead of the previous system where Leagues A and B together only incorporated 24 of the highest-ranked UEFA national associations.\nFinals, promotion, and relegation.\nIn the top league, League A, the winners of the four groups go on to play in the Nations League Finals, with two semi-finals, a third and fourth-place decider, and a final to decide which team becomes the UEFA Nations League champion. Beginning in 2024–25, the group winners and runners-up of League A advance to a new two-legged home-and-away quarter-final round. In each tie, group winners will face a runner-up from a different group, with the group winner hosting the second leg. The four quarter-final winners advance to the Nations League Finals using the same rules above.\nTeams can also be promoted and relegated to a higher or lower league. Starting in 2020–21, each group winner in Leagues B, C, and D is automatically promoted to the next higher league while the last-placed team in each group in Leagues A and B is automatically relegated to the next lower league for the next tournament. From 2020–21 to 2022–23, the League C teams to be relegated were determined by play-outs among fourth-placed teams, the specific ties being based on the teams' Nations League overall ranking. The teams that won on aggregate over two legs remained in League C while the losing teams were relegated to League D.\nStarting in 2024–25, the two worst-ranked League C teams will automatically be relegated. \nFurthermore, promotion/relegation play-offs were introduced, with the third-placed teams of League A facing the runners-up of League B, the third-placed teams of League B facing the runners-up of League C, and the two best-ranked fourth-placed teams of League C facing the runners-up of League D, with the winners going to the higher league and the losers entering the lower league. In all cases, the higher-ranked team hosts the second leg. If the aggregate score is level, extra time will be played without the away goals rule enforced, and if it is still tied after extra time, a penalty shoot-out will be used to decide the winner, as per guidelines by the UEFA Executive Committee on 16 December 2021.\nUEFA European Championship link.\nThe UEFA Nations League is linked with the UEFA European Championship qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for the UEFA European Championship.\nThere were play-offs for each of Leagues A, B, C, and D in October and November 2020. Each group winner earned a spot in the semi-finals. If the group winner was already one of the 20 qualified teams, rankings were used to give the play-off spot to another team of that league. If fewer than four teams in the entire league remained unqualified, play-off spots for that league were given to teams of the next lower league. This determined the four remaining qualifying spots for the European Championship (out of 24 total). However, starting with UEFA Euro 2024 onward, the now-downsized League D will no longer be given its own path. Instead, if any of Leagues A, B, or C have fewer than four teams that did not qualify directly for Euro 2024, the best-ranked group winner of League D will advance to the play-offs (unless that team already qualified for the final tournament). The remaining spots will be allocated based on the Nations League overall ranking, however, group winners from Leagues B and C cannot face teams from a higher league. Therefore, additional teams from League D can only advance to the play-offs if enough teams from League C qualify directly.\nFIFA World Cup link.\nThe Nations League was linked with European qualification for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, although to a lesser degree than the UEFA European Championship qualifying play-offs. The first round of the 2022 World Cup qualification consisted of ten groups, with each group winner directly qualified for the World Cup. Then, the second round (which followed a playoff format) was contested by the ten group runners-up, plus the best two Nations League group winners (based on the Nations League overall ranking) that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. The playoffs were split into three playoff paths, played in two semi-finals (hosted by the seeded teams) and the final (with the home teams to be drawn), from which an additional three teams also qualified.\nFor 2026, it will be again partially linked with European qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. The first round of the 2026 World Cup qualification consisted of twelve groups, with each group winner qualified directly for the World Cup. Then, in the second round, the twelve qualifying group runners-up and the four best-ranked Nations League group winners who are not qualifying group winners or runners-up will be drawn into four play-off paths of single-leg semi-finals and single-leg finals to determine the last four UEFA teams to qualify for the World Cup.\nIn an interview with the Polish website \"meczyki.pl\", UEFA vice-president Zbigniew Boniek said that all 10 teams from CONMEBOL, the South American Football Confederation, would join the UEFA Nations League from the 2024–25 edition of the competition. The plans, which would have acted as a response to FIFA's biennial World Cup plans, were intended as part of enhanced cooperation between the two organisations following the signing of a memorandum of understanding and the opening of a joint office in London. However, such an expansion was made unlikely after CONMEBOL submitted a request to FIFA to maintain the round-robin qualification format for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. On 25 January 2023, the UEFA Executive Committee confirmed the format for the 2024–25 UEFA Nations League, with no South American teams to be added.\nTrophy.\nThe UEFA Nations League trophy was unveiled during the phase draw in Lausanne, Switzerland. The trophy represents all 55 UEFA National associations and is made of sterling silver. The trophy weighs 7.5 kg and is 71 cm tall.\nAnthem.\nThe official anthem of the UEFA Nations League was recorded with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir, singing in Latin. It is a mix of classical and electronic music, and is played when the players are entering the field of play, in television sequences and for ceremonial purposes. The composers are Giorgio Tuinfort and Franck van der Heijden.\nSeasons.\nEach season of the UEFA Nations League is played in a typical UEFA competition season format: the league phase (or \"group stage\") in the first half of the season from September to November, and the knockout phase in the second half of the season in March (League A quarter-finals and promotion/relegation play-offs), and June (semifinals and finals of League A) respectively, meaning a UEFA Nations League champion is crowned every two years. An exception was made in the 2022–23 season when the league phase was played in June and September 2022, due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup played in Qatar at the end of the year.\nReactions.\nSupport.\nUEFA devised the tournament as a means to eliminate international friendlies – an aim that has been shared by many football clubs and supporters, with the regular football season being interrupted with non-competitive international matches as part of the FIFA International Match Calendar. Furthermore, it gives many countries who have not qualified for a major tournament a fighting chance.\nIn February 2012, it was agreed between UEFA and the European Club Association (ECA) that the international friendly schedule would be reduced from 12 to 9 matches a year with the August round of international friendlies in the UEFA confederation abolished from 2015. The aspiration to eliminate friendlies in favour of a more competitive tournament has been both welcomed and criticised by many football commentators.\nCriticism.\nThe format has been criticised for allowing weaker teams to qualify through the Nations League to compete in the European Championship finals, instead of qualifying through the standard qualification process. However, once the tournament began in 2018, it got applause for \"very high-level matches\" and impressive turnouts in the initial round of fixtures.\nHowever, criticism against Nations League resurfaced again in 2022 when major footballers like Kevin de Bruyne and Virgil van Dijk condemned the Nations League \"unimportant\" and only to glorify some friendlies as well as questioned the calendar due to possibility of injuries. Their stance is also shared by Jürgen Klopp, who called it \"ridiculous\". Croatia international Luka Modrić sparked even wider debate by accusing UEFA and the Nations League format \"inhumane\".\nInfluence.\nShortly after the foundation of the UEFA Nations League, CONCACAF, inspired by its success, announced that a similar competition format, the CONCACAF Nations League, would be established. The first edition was played in 2018. Also inspired by the recent success of the Nations League, the AFC had begun to formalise a similar competition, planned to begin in 2021 before being stalled due to the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAwards.\nPlayer of the Tournament and Goal of the Tournament awards are presented for players' performances in the UEFA Nations League Finals."

        "text": "Handball in Serbia was first played during the Interwar period. Originally, it was played in the form of Czech handball and field handball, forerunners to the modern sport of handball. From 1958, modern handball took primacy over other forms of the game. In November 1948 the first Belgrade handball championship took place.\nThe Handball Federation of Yugoslavia was formed in 1949. From 1953, the Yugoslav championship for men and women began. From 1955, the Yugoslavia national cup began.\nHistory of handball.\nHistory of handball in Serbia has not been sufficiently researched. There are data from official publications, as well as data from some other publications, whose authors are predominantly from the western parts of the former Yugoslavia. There are encountered in the data that suggest that the handball was played in Serbia after World War II. According to these data, the initiative for the development of handball in Serbia, was transcribed to instructors from Board for Handball Gymnastics Association of Croatia. In Youth Work Actions (Samac - Sarajevo 1947. year) instructors were running a school for \"training\" fitness instructors, including instructor for a handball game. In each of the 10 sections along the vast construction site was one handball instructor. In the year of 1948. during the work on the youth line Kučevo - Bodrica, was formed handball company, within the sports brigade, whose manager was Vojislav Vojnovic. With participation in the company of handball, instructors were got the \"legitimacy\" to after return in their own community, they were now able to work on establishing the handball section at their local gyms and gymnastic societies. Later these instructors are throughout Serbia, were founded the first handball clubs and teams in the country.\nThe credit for the development of sport in Serbia, Yugoslavia, later, to a certain degree belong to students who have gained their knowledge abroad. They are after arrival in their homeland, brought with them foreign local culture, features, and sports. Czech handball than later field handball was found its way in Serbia over Slovenia, Croatia and Hungary. Sports were continues to spread across the school organization, school physical education and other ways."

        "text": "Southampton Municipal Golf Course is a 27-hole golf course in Southampton, England. The par 70, 6174yd, 18-hole course is set in mature parkland. It is home to Southampton Golf Club.\nHistory.\nAfter World War I, Sir Sidney Kimber envisaged the council providing leisure activities to the people of Southampton. Until this point, the majority of private clubs were fairly exclusive and ‘the working man’ was not invited.\nThe course was designed by five time Open Championship winner J.H. Taylor, and was completed in 1935. Southampton was hailed as the best Municipal golf course in England when it opened before the outbreak of the World War II. However, it wasn’t until after the war that it became playable throughout the year.\nWhen the game began to boom during the 1980s and 1990s, there were close to 200,000 rounds being played at the golf course each year. However, as more ‘pay as you play’ facilities opened up in Hampshire, the figures dropped to 70,000 per year – although in 2004 the figures rose to 100,000 per year.\nIn June 2010, a £3 million deal was lined up for MyTime Active, a charitable trust, to run the golf course which was estimated to save the taxpayer £350,000 and drive up customer numbers.\nImpact of Covid-19 pandemic.\nCovid-19 struggles.\nDue to the COVID-19 restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, leisure centres were forced to closed for months in line with government guidelines. On 1 April 2021, Southampton City Council took over the management of the golf course after the previous operator had been hit by the pandemic and the expiry of their contract.\nSouthampton City Council and recovery.\nFollowing the change in management to Southampton City Council, essential grounds work was carried out on the golf course to bring it back to use. Plugs of soil were removed from the green and a feed, seed and sand mix was spread to rejuvenate the putting surfaces, whilst irrigation work was also carried out.\nIn late 2021, further work was completed on the golf course, including improvements to the greens, drainage, the playability of the course, paths along with other improvements. The council will also be improving the cottages. However, a recent bat survey revealed the presence of roosting bats within the cottages, which are legally protected, and are working with an ecologist to ensure the refurbishment is carried out correctly and in line with the National England mitigation license that has been granted.\nPost-pandemic.\nOn 19 August 2023, the golf course was vandalised by quadbikers which damaged the club's greens and left part of the course unusable to the club's members. The club's committee member, Matthew Longland, said this was the fourth time the course had been subjected to vandalism in 2023 and it would take until the end of the year for the green to recover."

He is a former coach of the Fiji national rugby 15s team.\nCareer.\nJohn Mckee is a New Zealand-born rugby union coach, who was the head coach of Fiji's 15s national rugby team. John Gregory McKee was born in Wellington, New Zealand, in 1957. McKee has been coaching since the late 1990s in Australia, but left in 2000 to coach French side AS Montferrand \"(now known as ASM Clermont Auvergne)\". In doing so, he led the team to the final of the 2000–01 French Rugby Union Championship, but lost 34–22 to Toulouse. In 2002 he became assistant coach of Connacht under Michael Bradley. McKee and Bradley led Connacht to the Quarter Finals of the 2002–03 Celtic League and the 2002–03 European Challenge Cup, before leading the side to two consecutive Semi Finals in the European Challenge Cup; 2003–04 and 2004–05. He left Ireland in 2005 to take over Cornish Pirates in the 2005–06 National Division One, finishing third behind Bedford Blues and Harlequins.\nIn 2007 he returned to Australia as the head coach of Central Coast Rays in the inaugural and sole Australian Rugby Championship. The Rays finished second behind the in the normal season, but finished on top at the final against Melbourne Rebels, winning 20–12. When the ARC became defunct, McKee travelled with the Pacific Islanders rugby union team on their 2008 European tour as a Specialist Coach. This tour included a record first-ever victory for the side, winning 25–17 against Italy. He furthered his international experience when he was named the Technical Advisor for Tonga in the year leading up to and during the 2011 Rugby World Cup.\nAfter working with Tonga, he took up the role of Programs Coach at the Australian Rugby Union, where he was involved in developing and delivering rugby programs for 18- to 22-year-old players in the ARU National Academy Program. This also meant he was the assistant coach for the Australian Under-20's side in the 2013 IRB Junior World Championship in France, Australia finished seventh.\nHe is an Australian Rugby Union Level 3 coach and has a NZRU-Massey University Diploma of Management. He has an Australian Strength and Conditioning Association Level 1 Coaching certification, and has a Fitness Instructor Certification from Monash University.\nFiji.\nIn November 2013, McKee was appointed as the Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) High Performance Unit general manager with the goal to get Fiji into the top eight of the IRB World Rankings. However, when the then head coach Inoke Male was sacked by the FRU due to financial issues, McKee expressed his desire in succeeding Male in February 2014, hoping that as head coach he could do more to help Fiji into the top eight of the World Rankings. On 2 May 2014, McKee was officially announced as the Flying Fijians head coach, cutting short his three-year contract as High Performance Unit general manager, and would lead the team into the final against the Cook Islands in June 2014.\nIn McKee's first match in charge, he led Fiji to a 25–14 win over Italy, Fiji's first win over a Tier 1 team since their 38–34 win over Wales in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In addition to this, he also led Fiji to first in the Pacific Islands conference of the 2014 IRB Pacific Nations Cup. This included a 45–17 win over Tonga and a 13–18 loss to Samoa. He coached the team to a 108–6 win over the Cook Islands in the 2015 Rugby World Cup Oceania qualification process, thus qualifying for England 2015, joining Pool A. During Fiji's 2014 European tour, McKee led the team to just one victory, coming against the United States winning 20–14. They had lost before this match, losing to France 40–15 and narrowly to Wales 17–13.\nIn 2015, McKee led the team to victory in the 2015 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup, where Fiji beat Tonga 30–22 and Japan 27–22, while also drawing with Samoa 30–30. The Fiji-Samoa game was repeated again in the final, which saw Fiji out score Samoa 5 tries to 3, winning 39–29. McKee later led Fiji into the 2015 Rugby World Cup, where despite only picking up one win, 47–15 win over Uruguay, Fiji was largely competitive in all 4 matches, holding Wales to a 23–13 win and Australia to 28–13. McKee was linked with the Japan post, but McKee dismissed the rumours announcing that he would seek renewal of is contract through to the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nIn 2016, McKee lead Fiji to their third consecutive Pacific Nations Cup title, having beaten Tonga 23–18, after being down 15–0 at half time, and defeating Samoa 26–16. However, on 24 June, Fiji lost against Georgia for the first time, losing 14–3. During their 2016 end-of-year tour, Fiji gained a single win across 3 matches, coming in the final week against Japan 38–25. The other games saw Fiji get defeated by England, 58–15 and the Barbarians 40–7.\nIn June 2017, Fiji was the only Tier 2 nation to play three Tier 1 internationals; Australia, Italy and Scotland. McKee led Fiji to two victories, their homes tests against Italy, 22–19, and Scotland, 27–22. It was the first ever time that Fiji had beaten more than one Tier 1 team in a single calendar year, while also beating Scotland for the first time since 1998. The Australian test saw Fiji lose to Australia in Melbourne 37–14. On 8 July 2017, McKee helped Fiji qualify for the 2019 Rugby World Cup after beating Tonga 14–10 during the 2017 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup. A week later with a 38–16 victory over Samoa saw Fiji retain their PNC title for a third consecutive year. Fiji continued their good form into their End-of-year European tour, narrowly losing Tier 1 sides Italy, 19–10, and Ireland 23–20. Fiji's only victory came in their final test on tour, defeating Canada 57–17, which was a record winning margin for Fiji over the Canadians.\nIn June 2018, McKee led Fiji to their fourth consecutive Pacific Nations title, after beating Samoa 24–22 in the opening round and newcomers Georgia 37–15 in the second round. Despite the winning the PNC title, On 23 June, Fiji lost to Tonga for the first time since 2011 27–19, in a one-off test match outside the PNC. The 2018 November test matches say Fiji win two from three games, including an historic victory over France, winning 21–14. Records continued for Fiji at the start of the 2019 International season, defeating the Māori All Blacks in Suva 27–10 in preparation for the 2019 World Rugby Pacific Nations Cup and World Cup. This was Fiji's first ever win over the Māori All Blacks in 16 matches, dating back to 1957. However the return fixture saw the Māori's win 26–17. During the 2019 PNC, Fiji not only lost their title held since 2015, but they also lost their first game in the competition since 2014; after losing to Japan 34–21 in the opening round. Victories over Canada and Samoa, meant Fiji finished runners-up to Japan.\nWestern Force.\nAfter leaving in January 2020, McKee took up an assistant role later in the year with Super Rugby team Western Force. McKee left the team in September 2021, and was replaced by Paul Tito."

        "text": "A Twenty20 International (T20I) is a form of cricket, played between two of the international members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), in which each team faces a maximum of twenty overs. The matches have top-class status and are the highest T20 standard. The game is played under the rules of Twenty20 cricket. The first Twenty20 International match between two men's sides was played on 17 February 2005, involving Australia and New Zealand. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" reported that \"neither side took the game especially seriously\", and it was noted by \"ESPNcricinfo\" that but for a large score for Ricky Ponting, \"the concept would have shuddered\". However, Ponting himself said \"if it does become an international game then I'm sure the novelty won't be there all the time\".\nThis is a list of India Cricket team's Twenty20 International records. It is based on the List of Twenty20 International records, but concentrates solely on records dealing with the Indian cricket team. India played its first Twenty20 game against South Africa in December 2006, and these records date from that game.\nKey.\nThe top five records are listed for each category, except for the team wins, losses, draws and ties, all round records and the partnership records.

If both sides have completed both their allocated innings and the side that fielded last has the higher aggregate of runs, it is known as a win by runs. This indicates the number of runs that they had scored more than the opposing side. If the side batting last wins the match, it is known as a win by wickets, indicating the number of wickets that were still to fall.\nGreatest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe largest victory recorded by India is during the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup against Scotland when they won by 8 wickets with 81 balls remaining.\nGreatest win margins (by wickets).\nIndia have won a T20I match by ten wicket margin on one occasions.\nNarrowest win margins (by runs).\nThe narrowest run margin victory is by 1 run in T20I's with India winning such games twice.\nNarrowest win margins (by balls remaining).\nThe narrowest winning margin by balls remaining in T20Is is by winning of the last ball which has been achieved 26 times.

Rohit Sharma with 7 ducks has the highest number of such knocks for India.\nBowling records.\nMost career wickets.\nA bowler takes the wicket of a batsman when the form of dismissal is bowled, caught, leg before wicket, stumped or hit wicket. If the batsman is dismissed by run out, obstructing the field, handling the ball, hitting the ball twice or timed out the bowler does not receive credit.\nBest figures in an innings.\nBowling figures refers to the number of the wickets a bowler has taken and the number of runs conceded. \nMost Maidens Overs\nBest career average.\nA bowler's bowling average is the total number of runs they have conceded divided by the number of wickets they have taken.\nAfghanistan's Rashid Khan holds the record for the best career average in T20Is with 12.62.

Chahar during his record breaking spell also recorded the best strike rate for an Indian bowler.\nHat-trick.\nIn cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets with consecutive deliveries. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count.\nWicket-keeping records.\nThe wicket-keeper is a specialist fielder who stands behind the stumps being guarded by the batsman on strike and is the only member of the fielding side allowed to wear gloves and leg pads.\nMost career dismissals.\nA wicket-keeper can be credited with the dismissal of a batsman in two ways, caught or stumped. A fair catch is taken when the ball is caught fully within the field of play without it bouncing after the ball has touched the striker's bat or glove holding the bat, Laws 5.6.2.2 and 5.6.2.3 state that the hand or the glove holding the bat shall be regarded as the ball striking or touching the bat while a stumping occurs when the wicket-keeper puts down the wicket while the batsman is out of his ground and not attempting a run.\nMost career stumpings.\nDhoni also holds the record for most stumpings by a wicket-keeper.\nFielding records.\nMost career catches.\nCaught is one of the nine methods a batsman can be dismissed in cricket. The majority of catches are caught in the slips, located behind the batsman, next to the wicket-keeper, on the off side of the field. Most slip fielders are top order batsmen.\nPartnership records.\nIn cricket, two batsmen are always present at the crease batting together in a partnership. This partnership will continue until one of them is dismissed, retires or the innings comes to a close.\nHighest partnerships by wicket.\nA wicket partnership describes the number of runs scored before each wicket falls. The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed."

        "text": "The 2018 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup was the sixth edition of the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, the biennial international women's youth football championship contested by the under-17 national teams of the member associations of FIFA, since its inception in 2008.\nThe tournament was held in Uruguay from 13 November to 1 December 2018. North Korea were the defending champions but were eliminated by Spain in the quarter-finals.\nThe final took place at the Estadio Charrúa, Montevideo between Spain and Mexico a rematch from the group stage in 2016. Spain won their first title, beating Mexico 2–1.\nHost selection.\nOn 6 March 2014, FIFA announced that bidding had begun for the 2018 FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup. Member associations interested in hosting must submit a declaration of interest by 15 April 2014, and provide the complete set of bidding documents by 31 October 2014.\nThe following countries made official bids for hosting the tournament:\nThe decision on the hosts was originally to be made at the FIFA Executive Committee meeting on 19–20 March 2015, but no announcement was made after the meeting.\nDuring FIFA president Gianni Infantino's visit to Uruguay in March 2016, Uruguay showed interest in organizing the event. The FIFA Council appointed Uruguay as host on 10 May 2016. This was the first FIFA tournament held in the country since the first men's World Cup in 1930, and the first FIFA women's event held in Uruguay.\nQualified teams.\nA total of 16 teams qualify for the final tournament. In addition to Uruguay who qualified automatically as hosts, the other 15 teams qualify from six separate continental competitions. The slot allocation was approved by the FIFA Council on 13–14 October 2016.\nBranding.\nThe emblem was launched on 16 November 2017 at the Palacio Legislativo in Montevideo. The emblem is inspired by the famous beach coastline and its shape of the tournament's trophy. It features the Uruguayan flower ceibo, the Candombe drummer and the sun from the national flag.\nMascot.\nThe mascot named Capi was unveiled on 7 June 2018, she is inspired by a Uruguayan capybara.\nSlogan.\nThe slogan \"Same Game, Same Emotion\" was unveiled on 29 September 2018.\nDraw.\nThe official draw was held on 30 May 2018, 15:00 CEST (), at the FIFA Headquarters in Zürich.

Teams of the same confederation could not meet in the group stage.\nThe identity of the three teams from CONCACAF were not known at the time of the draw, and were seeded based on the rankings of the three best-performing teams from the region in previous editions. They were assigned to the three places reserved for CONCACAF after the qualifying tournament was completed based on their rankings in the seeding formula (instead of their rankings in the qualifying tournament).\nMatch officials.\nA total of 15 referees and 28 assistant referees were appointed by FIFA for the tournament.\nSquads.\nPlayers born between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2003 are eligible to compete in the tournament. Each team has to name a preliminary squad of 35 players. From the preliminary squad, the team has to name a final squad of 21 players (three of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad can be replaced due to serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nGroup stage.\nThe official schedule was unveiled on 8 February 2018.\nThe top two teams of each group advance to the quarter-finals. The rankings of teams in each group are determined as follows (regulations Article 17.7):\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings are determined as follows:\nAll times are local, UYT ().\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, a penalty shoot-out was used to determine the winner (no extra time was played).\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given for the tournament:"

        "title": "1992 Troy State vs. DeVry men's basketball game",
        "text": "The 1992 Troy State vs. DeVry men's basketball game is the highest-scoring men's basketball game in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) history, regardless of division classification. On January 12, 1992, Troy State University, now known as Troy University, defeated DeVry University of Atlanta 258–141 in a game that is considered to have established several unbreakable records. In a 2017 video-essay by Jon Bois, he re-counted the game's score using unedited game footage and argued that the correct score should be 253–141, although the official NCAA box score remains unchanged.\nBackground.\nDuring the 1991–92 college basketball season, Troy State was playing its next to last year as an NCAA Division II school before transitioning to Division I. They were led by head coach Don Maestri, whose unconventional offense-oriented system led to incredibly high-scoring games; that season, Troy State led all of Division II with a 121.0 points per game scoring average (while also giving up 107.8 per game). They attempted an NCAA-record 1,303 three-pointers in 1991–92 and scored on 444 of them. Maestri's philosophy was to unapologetically attempt steals on an opponent's every possession, and if they missed the steal, they allowed the opponent to score as long as they scored quickly. He substituted players regularly and knew that his track-meet style of pressure would eventually wear out the other team. Once tired, his Troy State squads would continue to relentlessly pursue opponents on the defensive end; on offense, no shot was considered a bad shot, and the quicker the attempt, the better. The high-octane offense used by Troy State was modeled after Paul Westhead's Loyola Marymount teams of the era; Maestri even had Westhead mail him Loyola Marymount game tapes to study the plays and methods used by the successful Division I school.\nHeading into the match-up against DeVry University of Atlanta, the Trojans sported a 12–3 record while the DeVry Hoyas had a 3–15 record. DeVry was classified as a National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) Division II school; it struggled to get wins against comparably talented opponents, let alone high-octane, successful NCAA Division II schools. The previous season, Troy State had set the NCAA record for points in a game with 187—also against DeVry of Atlanta. Stacking the odds further against DeVry was that they had only seven players, thus any chance of resting and catching their breath during substitutions was minimal at best.\nThe game.\nAfter tip-off, Troy State scored their first basket after 54 seconds. Player Paul Bryan later said, jokingly, \"It was a little touch and go there early.\" Despite their frenetic pace, the Trojans \"only\" had 15 points after the first three minutes. As the game settled into its soon-to-be record breaking pace, points came steadily; with 3:14 remaining in the first half, Troy eclipsed the 100-point mark. Guard Tommy Davis said, \"When you see one guy hitting, then everybody gets in the act. It becomes contagious.\" At the end of the first half, the score was 123–53. They made 21 three-pointers in the first 20 minutes, and their 123 points had already broken their own NCAA single-half record from the year before (103), also set against DeVry.\nWithin the first three minutes of the second half, the Trojans scored 26 points and had already accumulated 149 overall with 17 minutes remaining. It was not until 6:35 into the second half that Troy State scored their first points of the half that were not three-pointers or dunks. With 10 minutes remaining, Chris Greasham's three-pointer gave Troy 189, eclipsing the previous NCAA single-game scoring record of 187. Then, with 7:53 to go, they surpassed the 200-point mark, becoming the first and only team in college basketball history to surpass this threshold. The scoreboard was not built to display 200-plus points, and so when the moment occurred, it did not display the numbers correctly (the scoreboard operator's solution was to start over at zero). During the second half alone, the Trojans scored 135 points, besting their minutes-old record of 123, and their 30 three-pointers in the second stanza was higher than the NCAA all-time full-game record of 25 (set previously by Troy). Their 51 made three-point field goals more than doubled that record, and their 109 three-point attempts record stood for 31 seasons before being broken in December 2022. Tommy Davis remarked that the game \"reminded [him] of a street game you play in the summer.\" Jack Smith credited their home crowd to giving players the extra energy they needed to maintain the record-shattering pace: \"It seems almost impossible to hit 200 points in a game. It's a great, great feeling. The crowd played a big part in us getting the record. Their hollering gave us the energy we needed.\"\nFor the game, 10 of the 11 Troy State players scored in double figures. Terry McCord, who the following season would be named an NCAA Division II All-American, led the team with 41 points on 16-for-26 shooting. The only player not to score in double figures was Andy Davis, who made the game's first basket and finished 1-for-1. Eight of the 11 Trojans scored at least 20 points, and of those, five scored at least 29. Smith recorded the game's only triple-double, with 29 points, 13 rebounds, and 11 assists. Of the many statistical anomalies to occur in this high-scoring game, one was that only three total free throws were attempted between the teams (Troy attempted, and made, all three). DeVry's Clayton Jones had 19 of the Hoyas' 44 turnovers by himself, while DeVry's Dartez Daniel scored a game-high 42 points on 20-for-30 shooting.\nAftermath.\nThe January 12, 1992, game between Troy State and DeVry remains the highest-scoring single game in NCAA history. Seven statisticians worked for 57 minutes after the game ended to complete its box score. Among records considered unbreakable are total combined points (399), points by one team in one half (135), and three-pointers made (51) by one team in a single game. That season, Troy State compiled a 23–6 overall record while setting many school records along the way, including single-season scoring average (121.0), field goals made and attempted (1,274/2,839), three-pointers made and attempted (444/1,303), and steals (460). They also set single-game records for points (258), points in a half (135), field goals made and attempted (102/190), rebounds (94), assists (65), and total combined points for two teams in a single game. Troy State lost in the first round of the NCAA Division II Tournament. The Trojans have since transitioned to NCAA Division I, and the school changed its name to the current Troy University in 2005; while they have won six conference championships through the 2021–22 season, they have reached the NCAA Division I Tournament just twice. DeVry University, meanwhile, dropped its entire athletics program from its Atlanta campus in the 1990s. Its teams were rarely competitive, and the cost to maintain sports outweighed the returns. The basketball team finished the 1991–92 season with a 3–16 record.\n2017 video analysis.\nOn March 13, 2017, \"SB Nation\"'s Jon Bois published a video in which he argued that the correct final score of the game should have been Troy State 253, DeVry 141. Relying on a single continuous recording of the game posted to YouTube, Bois counted all made baskets and arrived at 253 points for Troy State. He identified two potential scorer's errors: a Troy State dunk that went in after the horn had errantly blown that resulted in a return of the ball to Troy State, and an attempted three-point basket that ended with the ball lodged between the backboard and rim."

        "text": "Icetrack cycling is a bicycle racing sport usually held on 400 m speed skating ice ovals. However, any ice sheet can be used, including ice hockey rinks and frozen lakes.\nHistory.\nThe sport of cycling on ice is probably as old as the sport of cycling. Icetrack cycling has many similarities to track cycling. There are many examples of bikes that have been built or adapted to cope with the hard and slippery surface of ice. Usually practiced in places where a winter freeze turns lakes into inviting sheets of ice, annual events attract all types of ice bikes and competitors. Various ice rinks also host (annual) events. In the Netherlands, icetrack cycling is developing rapidly due to the availability of \"standard\" ice bikes, making the sport more accessible.\nThe term \"icetrack\" is specifically used for cycling on ice suitable for skating on (i.e., not on snow or rough ice).\nEquipment.\nMany types of bike have been tried over the years. The current \"standard\" bikes use one drive wheel at the back, a steering skate at the front and a cornering skate out to the right.\nThe \"drive wheel\" is a 20″ bicycle wheel with derailleur gears. Various tyres can be selected to suit the ice surface. Spikes are not used on a 400 m ice oval.\nThe \"steering skate\" is ground to a profile which ensures the bike turns when the skate is turned - the skate being attached to handlebars operated by the user.\nThe \"cornering skate\" provides the force needed to get the bike round the left hand corners at either end of the ice oval.\nThe user sits in a recumbent position to ensure a low centre of gravity on the slippery ice.\nRace formats.\nIcetrack cycling events fit into two broad categories: timed/individual races and multiple bike races.\n\"Timed races\" use the same format as speed skating events. Various distances between 500 m and 10,000 m are completed against the clock, with a maximum of two competitors on the ice at any one time. Many ice ovals include a wire loop embedded in the ice along the finish line which can detect the passing of a transponder attached to the competitor, thus providing automated timing (often linked to the internet).\n\"Multiple bike\" races of up to 20 bikes use a standing start from a grid with races held over three, five or nine laps. The position on the start grid is decided based on a timed qualifying flying lap.\n\"Keirin\". The bikes are also used to start a Keirin race for speed skating (replacing the Derny in a velodrome). In a keirin for skaters, the bike starts on the opposite side of the oval and the skaters then start from a standing start as the bike passes them. The bike then regulates the speed, which increases over two laps, before slowing and moving to the left. The skaters then sprint the last lap to the finish. Any number of skaters between six and 16 can take part in a race, depending on the local club. Championship races have eight competitors.\nTrack records.\nThe current record for one flying lap of a 400 m ice oval stands at 33.18 s, set on 11 December 2015 in De Bonte Wever Assen NL\nThe ice track hour record stands at 35.258 km, set by Eva Navratilova (CZE) on 14 November 2015 in Thialf (Heerenveen, NL). This record is recognised by the WHPVA."

        "title": "Queensland Suburban Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Queensland Suburban Rugby Union, or QSRU, is affiliated to the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) and runs the rugby competition colloquially known as \"Subbies\" in Brisbane and South East Queensland.\nThe QSRU selects a representative side to play annual matches against NSW Suburban, for the Barraclough Shield. The major \"Subbies\" trophy is the Barber Cup, awarded to the first grade premiers of the first division.\nThe Subbies competition has around 1000 players and 20 clubs competing in three divisions, spread across Brisbane spanning from Redcliffe to Beenleigh, and Wynnum to Ipswich. The competition is for amateur players, and provides another tier of rugby below the Brisbane premier club competition.\nHistory.\nThe earliest predecessors of the sub-districts rugby union in Queensland were the Minor Rugby Union and the Sub-Junior Minor Rugby Union, which were founded in 1888 and 1890 respectively for second and third tier teams.\n1964–1999.\nThe Queensland Sub-District Rugby Union was founded in 1964. Mirror Newspapers donated the Sunday Truth Shield for the competition which was contested by nine teams including the Commonwealth Bank, AMP, Bank of New South Wales, and Law Clerks. The Gold Coast Eagles joined in 1965, winning the competition that year and in 1966, and finishing second in 1967.\nThe competition was restructured after the 1993 season to provide a secondary level of rugby under the Brisbane premiership. Strong district and suburban clubs in Brisbane were grouped into a new suburban competition sponsored by Coca-Cola. Teams in the renamed competition's inaugural season in 1994 included Caboolture and Everton Park to the north, Kenmore and Ipswich to the west, Redlands and Wynnum to the east, and Beenleigh and Logan City to the south.\nMembership of the Subbies competition grew in the 1990s with an increase in corporate and university sides as well as teams formed by ex-students of schools. The growth in population of Brisbane led to the growth in the number of rugby clubs.\nWhen Coca-Cola's sponsorship ended after the 1998 season, the QSRU administered 47 teams representing 30 clubs in seven grades of competition spread across five divisions. Division I was composed of the Norbert Byrne Cup (1st grade), Geoff R. Pegg Cup (2nd grade), and Robert A. Tuckey Cup (Colts) competitions; with the club championship Sydney Cup awarded based on the best all round performance of the Division I clubs. The lower division competitions were the John Barber Cup (Division II), Edinburgh Cup (Division III), Ian Scotney Cup (Division IV), and Darwin V. Normanby Cup (Division V). A number of Division I clubs, however, had begun to experience problems in fielding a colts (under 20s) side.\nFrom 1999 onwards, due to insufficient teams for a stand-alone colts competition, the Subbies clubs began to play their colts sides in the Brisbane or Gold Coast competitions.\n2000–2019.\nThe QSRU competition was reduced to four grades in 2000 when Ipswich and Logan City transferred to the Brisbane competition, Redlands relocated to the Gold Coast competition, and the QUT club folded. Wynnum and Everton Park, as the only former Division I clubs remaining, were merged into the lower division competitions.\nNew clubs, including the Black Rhinos and Brisbane Irish, were added in 2001 and the QSRU competition was restructured into three divisions. There were five grades in total, with the Barber, Pegg, Scotney, Wyatt, and Normanby Cups being contested. Promotion and relegation between the divisions was introduced in 2007.\nIn 2011, an under 19 representative Subbies team was selected to compete in the annual City v Country Carnival, however the QSRU has not been involved in administering colts rugby teams since then.\nThe QSRU had three divisions encompassing five grades of competition in 2014. In Division 2, the first grade Scotney Cup was incorporated into the Brisbane fourth grade competition for the 2014 and 2015 seasons to provide additional opposition teams, but was restored to a Subbies-only contest thereafter. Until 2012, the Wyatt Cup had been contested by the second grade teams in Division 2 but after four seasons without competition from 2013–2016, the trophy was re-purposed for an additional Division 3 competition in 2017.\nIn 2018 the Division 1 clubs were reduced to four in number—Caboolture, Goodna, Springfield and Wynnum—and to provide additional opposition the first and second grades played matches against clubs from the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union in the first half of the season.\nAt the completion of the 2018 season, the two Division 1 Grand Final teams - premiership winners Wynnum and Caboolture announced that they were leaving the QSRU competition, and would join the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union from the start of the 2019 season. The Queensland Suburban Rugby Union then had only one grade of competition within each of the three divisions in 2019 – the Barber Cup in Division 1, Pegg Cup in Division 2 and Normanby Cup in Division 3.\nRecent events.\nThe Pegg Cup was not contested in 2020 and the Division 2 competition for men's teams was replaced by the inaugural women's competition in that year. The Women's Cup competition was played as twelve-a-side. Division 1 men's reserve grade was reinstated in 2021, with the Pegg Cup awarded as its competition trophy.\nCompetition structure.\nThe Queensland Suburban Rugby is made up of three divisions as of 2021, structured as follows:\nTeams.\nClubs competing for the Barber Cup as of 2021, are:\nClubs competing for the Pegg Cup:\nClubs competing for the Women's Cup:\nClubs competing for the Normanby Cup: \nRepresentative team.\nA Queensland Suburban team is selected from players within the competition each year to play against other amateur representative sides.\nUntil the end of the 2011 season, an under 19 representative Subbies team was also selected to compete in the annual City v Country Carnival. An annual interstate match against NSW Suburban for the Barraclough Shield was played from 1966 to 2016."

Their head coach was Kim Anderson, who was in his first year as the head coach at Missouri. The team played its home games at Mizzou Arena in Columbia, Missouri, and played its third season in the Southeastern Conference. They finished the season 9–23, 3–15 in SEC play to finish in last place. They lost in the first round of the SEC tournament to South Carolina.\nPreseason.\nComing off an inconsistent 2013-14 season that saw Missouri finish with a 23-12 (9-9) record and a trip to the NIT there were many changes that took place in the off/preseason. The team lost the likes of Jabari Brown and Jordan Clarkson to the NBA draft and lost Criswell and Ross to graduation. On April 10, 2014 then head coach Frank Haith kicked Zach Price off the team for legal reasons. The following week on April 18 it was announced that Haith was leaving Missouri and had taken the opening as the head coach of Tulsa. Aften ten days of speculation it was announced that Kim Anderson would be returning to his Alma Mater and become the next head coach at Missouri. The team returned two starters (Ryan Rosburg, Johnathan Williams III), five incoming freshmen (Gant, Wright, Allen, Isabell, Gill-Caesar), and one transfer (Shamburger) making this Missouri Tiger team one of the youngest in the Nation.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D; color:#000000;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#F1B82D;\"| SEC Tournament"

After four seasons of college in the United States, Edwards returned to his adoptive home in New Zealand to play for the Canterbury Rams. He won the NZNBL Rookie of the Year in 2014 and later had stints in Australia and England.\nEarly life.\nEdwards was born in Albany, New York to parents Johnathan and Debbie Edwards. At a young age, he moved with his missionary parents to Christchurch, New Zealand. There he attended the basketball-focused Middleton Grange School, where he graduated from in 2007. In 2008–09, Edwards attended Lakeland Senior High School in Lakeland, Florida for a prep season. He went on to earn first-team All-State honors with the Dreadnaughts. He was also honored as the county Player of the Year and the Lakeland Ledger Player of the Year after averaging 17.7 points and 9.5 rebounds per game.\nCollege career.\nFrom 2009 to 2011, Edwards attended Hillsborough Community College. In his two seasons for the Hawks, he was a two-time All-Conference selection. As a freshman, he averaged 16 points and seven rebounds per game, and as a sophomore, he averaged 18.6 points and 6.8 rebounds per game.\nIn 2011, Edwards transferred to Valparaiso University. As a junior in 2011–12, he was a role player for the Crusaders, coming off the bench to record 12 double-figure scoring games. In 30 games, he averaged 9.4 points and 3.1 rebounds in 17.8 minutes per game.\nIn 2012, Edwards transferred to Arizona State University and subsequently sat out the 2012–13 season due to NCAA transfer rules. As a senior in 2013–14, he played just 15 games for the Sun Devils, averaging 2.5 points in 6.7 minutes per game.\nProfessional career.\nOn March 24, 2014, Edwards signed with the Canterbury Rams for the 2014 New Zealand NBL season. In 17 games, he averaged 17.8 points, 5.5 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game. He was subsequently named Rookie of the Year.\nOn October 29, 2014, Edwards signed with the Adelaide 36ers of the Australian NBL as an injury-replacement for Mitch Creek. On November 21, 2014, he was released by the 36ers following Creek's return. In three games, he averaged 1.7 points per game.\nOn February 8, 2015, Edwards re-signed with the Rams for the 2015 season. In 18 games, he averaged 17.7 points, 4.1 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.0 steals per game.\nIn August 2015, Edwards joined the Wellington Saints for their Asian tour, playing in Taiwan at the William Jones Cup and in the Philippines at the MVP Cup.\nOn October 10, 2015, Edwards signed with the Plymouth Raiders of the British Basketball League. However, he was released on November 7 after just two games, with the club citing \"flagrant disregard for club rules, and for serious off court issues\".\nNational team career.\nEdwards became one of the youngest Junior Tall Blacks when he debuted at just 14 years old in 2005. At the 2009 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, he averaged 14.9 points and 7.0 rebounds per game. At the 2011 World University Games, he led New Zealand in scoring and finished third among all tournament players, averaging 20.1 points per game."

Due to the addition of Notre Dame to conference play, a new playoff format was introduced for the 2018 tournament, utilizing campus sites instead.\nFormat.\n2014–2017.\nFrom 2014 through 2017, all six Big Ten teams participated in a single-elimination tournament held over three days at one neutral host site. These four tournaments alternated between Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota and Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan.\nTeams were seeded by the regular-season conference standings. In the quarterfinals on Thursday of the tournament weekend, No. 3 played No. 6 and No. 4 played No. 5. On Friday, No. 2 played the winner of the first game and No. 1 played the winner of the second game (the teams were not reseeded). The two semifinal winners played each other on Saturday in the final.\n2018–Present.\nDue to poor attendance at the neutral site tournaments, and the addition of Notre Dame as a seventh Big Ten team in hockey, a new format was introduced in 2018. The No. 1 team in the regular-season conference standings automatically advances to the conference semifinals, while the remaining teams are seeded into best-of-three quarterfinals to determine the three remaining teams. The remainder of the playoff is single-elimination.\nAll games are held at the home arena of the team with the higher seed, rather than a neutral site. In order to reduce the likelihood of scheduling conflicts at team venues, the semifinals and championship are played as single games (in contrast to other conference tournaments). The 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMembers.\nThere are currently seven member schools, with all seven participating in the men's division."

        "title": "Horse racing in South Korea",
        "text": "Horse racing in South Korea traces back to May 1898, when a foreign language institute run by the government included a donkey race in its athletic rally. However, this type of racing was sponsored for entertainment purposes only. No betting was conducted. It was in the 1920s that 'modern' horse racing involving a betting system made its debut. In 1922, the Chosun Racing Club, the nation's first-ever authorized horse racing club, was established to make horse racing more systematic and better organized. In 1923, the pari-mutuel betting system was officially adopted for the first time in Korea. The Sinseol-dong racecourse opened in 1928 and incorporated racing clubs were allowed to have their own racecourses.\nFinally, in 1933, a Japanese decree on horse racing was promulgated. Under the decree, only incorporated racing clubs were entitled to conduct horse racing. The Chosun Horse Racing Authority was also established in 1933 to coordinate and control incorporated racing clubs across the nation and ensure consistency in their administration. A racetrack named after the one in Florida, Hialeah, was established by the Japanese in Busan. The location was later used as a U.S. military base, Camp Hialeah, but retained the oval shape of a racetrack. It has since been returned to the Republic of Korea.\nIn 1945, the Chosun Horse Affairs Authority was renamed the Korea Racing Authority, and efforts were made to restore the national identity in horse racing. However, the Korean War which broke out in 1950 resulted in great turmoil for Korean society, thus undermining the development of horse racing. Worse yet, during the three-year war, racecourses were requisitioned for military training and horse racing came to an abrupt halt.\nTo keep the tradition of horse racing alive, the Korea Racing Authority worked out a plan to reestablish the racecourse at Ttuksom in Seoul. The construction, which began during the war, was completed in May 1954. With its dedication, horse racing resumed, and the newly constructed Ttksom racecourse served as the hub of Korean horse racing until it was relocated to the modern racecourse in Gwacheon in 1989.\nPari-mutuel bets were tallied manually until 1984. The inefficient management of the pari-mutuel betting system was a major stumbling block to broadening the fan base. To overcome this fundamental obstacle, the computerized pari-mutuel betting system was established in 1984, and at the same time, horse racing came to be televised in color, both on &amp; off-course. These two measures played a decisive role in boosting attendance and turnover. For instance in 1984, the turnover and attendance increased by 67% and 58%, respectively, from the previous year.\nTo form a link in the chain of the program to make the most of the Olympic facilities, the government designated the KRA as the organization exclusively responsible for providing the Olympic Equestrian Park. Accordingly, the KRA secured of the land in Gwacheon area on the southern outskirts of Seoul and began its construction in 1984 till 1988. After the Olympics, the Park was converted into racing facilities named Seoul Race Park, and the first race was held on September 1, 1989. With the opening of the Seoul Race Park, the 36-year-long era of the Ttuksom Racecourse came to an end and the nation's horse racing continued to make great strides.\nAs part of the efforts to preserve the ponies native to Jeju Island, which has been designated as Natural Monument No. 347, the KRA began the construction of the Jeju Racecourse at the foot of Mount Halla in October 1987. Three years later in October 1990, the Racecourse opened for pony racing.\nAs an effort to raise racing quality and promote horseracing nationwide, the KRA started to construct the new thoroughbred racecourse in Busan, the second-largest city in South Korea. The racecourse opened in September 2005. The growth of Korean racing and KRA's internationalization efforts have drawn international attention since the beginning of the 2000s. Led by this, in October 2002, the Asian Racing Federation decided to designate South Korea as the host of the 30th Asian Racing Conference in May 2005. Also, in June 2004, the International Cataloguing Standards Committee included Korea as one of the Part III countries and decided to add seven South Korean Grade Races to the Blue Book list starting from 2005."

        "title": "Kowloon Park Swimming Pool",
        "text": "The Kowloon Park Swimming Pool (), located in Tsim Sha Tsui, Kowloon, is one of the most heavily used swimming pool complexes in Hong Kong, serving over 2,000 swimmers daily. It includes four indoor heated pools, including an Olympic sized 50-metre main pool, two 25-metre training pools, and a 20-metre diving pool. There are also several outdoor leisure pools.\nAs one of the best-equipped swimming pools in Hong Kong, it is the only venue in Kowloon suitable for staging major or international swimming events.\nHistory.\nThe Kowloon Park Swimming Pool was built as part of a greater redevelopment and expansion of Kowloon Park that was completed in 1989 under the sponsorship of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. The swimming complex-cum-indoor games hall was designed by a joint venture between United Kingdom-based Derek Walker Associates and Hong Kong firm Simon Kwan and Associates. It was engineered by BuroHappold, and the main contractor was Shui On. It opened on 12 September 1989 and was originally managed by the Urban Council.\nThe HK$6-million bilingual scoreboard, the \"most sophisticated of its kind in Hongkong\", was custom-built for Kowloon Park Swimming Pool by Omega SA. An integrated timing system allowed the scoreboard to display individual times for each of the competition pool's eight lanes. A special computer terminal could be used to input Chinese characters, which could be displayed along with Latin characters using the scoreboard's 20,000 lamps. The scoreboard drew interest from the sporting community, and a delegation from China visited the swimming pool to view and assess its capabilities.\nOther innovative features employed for the first time in Hong Kong were the depth-adjustable main pool, which allows the water depth to be changed according to the function, as well as the use of ozone disinfection for water treatment to reduce reliance on chlorination.\nIn 2000 the Urban Council was disbanded by the government, and management of the swimming pool became the responsibility of the newly formed Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD).\nFrom 2007 to 2009, major improvement works were carried out. The indoor free form leisure pool was converted into one of the 25-metre training pools, and a trampoline room extension was constructed. The pool hosted the 2009 East Asian Games, and ahead of this event facilities were added for swimming officials, marshals, doping control, first aid, equipment and the media.\nFacilities.\nThe complex has four indoor heated pools. The 50-metre main pool has a spectator stand, digital scoreboard, and electronic timing equipment. The moveable pool bottom allows the depth to be adjusted. The 25-metre training pool on the same level as the main pool was converted from a leisure pool ahead of the 2009 East Asian Games. Another 25-metre training pool, on level 2, is equipped with an accessible ramp, and on certain days of the week is open only to the elderly, persons with disabilities, and those with chronic diseases. There is also a diving pool and trampoline room.\nThe outdoor area has three leisure pools open on a seasonal basis. These are popular in the summer months. The outdoor area also has a circular, shallow pool for young children, toilets, and a sunbathing area.\nCapacity and patronage.\nThe complex can accommodate a maximum of 1530 swimmers at one time, and has an annual attendance of more than 1 million visitors. It is the most heavily visited swimming pool in Hong Kong, with daily attendance of more than 2,000.\nRecent developments.\nIn April 2017, a large fence was built down the middle of the main outdoor leisure pool, separating it in two. The Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LCSD) stated that the fence helped improve safety by improving lifeguard sight-lines, which are partly obstructed by the columns supporting the public footbridge above the pool. Swimmers protested the construction as unnecessary, and said that it diminished the character of the pool as well as its recreational value, as some visitors enjoyed the shade beneath the bridge. Legislative councillor Leung Yiu-chung echoed these sentiments, stating that the fence was excessive and urged the LCSD to find a balance between safety and public amenity.\nParts of the pool complex were refurbished in 2020. The main pool's floating platform (in use since 1989) and starting blocks were replaced, and general maintenance and repairs were carried out."

In 1997, the World Blind Golfers Conference was held in Perth, Australia, where representatives from six countries participated to propose the articles of association and handicap system. In 1998, the proposal was resolved at a meeting held during the 5th Blind Golf World Championship in Florida, US, so that a global governing organization could be established. Handa was elected as the first president, and David Blyth from Australia became the first chairman (responsible in administration).\nThere were eight organizations that took part in the World Blind Golfers’ Conference held in 1997 from 6 countries; Japan, United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\nAs of 2014, International Blind Golf Association has 18 member organizations from 16 countries including 4 associate organizations from 4 countries."

        "title": "Eric Campbell (baseball)",
        "text": "Eric Singleton Campbell (born April 9, 1987), nicknamed \"Soup\", is an American professional baseball utility player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets and Seattle Mariners, and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hanshin Tigers.\nEarly life.\nCampbell was born on April 9, 1987, in Norwich, Connecticut, the younger of two children to Hugh Baird \"Duke\" Campbell and Amy B. Campbell (née Burgess). His father was a school principal at the Norwich Free Academy as well as a baseball and basketball coach, while his mother, a 1977 NFA graduate, served as assistant principal and principal at Hebron Elementary School until her 2015 retirement after previously having spent 27 years working in Preston School District at Preston Veterans School in a variety of roles, including as a onetime principal-designee.\nBaseball career.\nHigh school.\nCampbell attended the Norwich Free Academy and played on the school's varsity baseball team beginning in his freshman year. Campbell played first base his freshman year, then moved to third in tenth grade and to shortstop as a junior, setting himself up for the versatility he would become known for on a professional level. Campbell was part of the 2003 team that won the Connecticut state high school championship. While in high school, Campbell was named to \"Baseball America\"'s preseason All-America and All-Northeast first teams; he also received All-Conference and \"New Haven Register\" All-State accolades. Described by coach John Iovino as a \"complete, and I mean \"complete\"\" player, as a senior, Campbell served as team captain and set Norwich Free Academy career records for hits, home runs, batting average, stolen bases, runs, walks and at bats, hitting nearly .500 on the season in the leadoff spot. Even as a Major Leaguer, Campbell reflected fondly upon his teenage years, saying: \"My favorite memories of playing baseball is playing for NFA, because you are playing with all of your best friends and having fun. That's what this game is about.\" He was a high school teammate of Andrew Carignan.\nCollege.\nAfter being spotted by then-coach Peter Hughes, Campbell was offered a scholarship to play college baseball for Boston College, where he was teammates with Pete Frates, who would later originate the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. As a freshman with the Eagles, Campbell hit .260, batting sixth and starting at third base. He improved his batting average to .350 with 20 doubles and 41 RBI in 52 games as a sophomore. As a junior, he hit .306 with 18 doubles, 43 runs and 41 RBI in 53 games. At Boston College, Campbell gained the appellation \"Soup\" from his teammates, a name which he would later carry into his professional career. Campbell was described by Eagles coach Mik Aoki as a \"good, sarcastic Northeasterner\" with a dry sense of humor, a good teammate and a humble player who could easily blend into any clubhouse environment.\nNew York Mets.\nCampbell was drafted by the New York Mets in the 8th round of the 2008 MLB Amateur Draft, although he attempted to avoid following too closely the media coverage of the event, opting instead to go golfing with his father Hugh. Campbell, who had suspected that he would be chosen before the 15th round, only found out of his being picked by the Mets when he happened to check his computer before leaving for the links.\nCampbell began his professional career in low-A with the Brooklyn Cyclones in 2008, hitting .260 and fielding .949 at third base, his main position. He split 2009 between the Savannah Sand Gnats, where he hit .248, and St. Lucie Mets, with whom he had 6 hits in 22 at-bats. In 2010, he played for the GCL Mets (going 3-for-11 at the plate), St. Lucie (with whom he hit .335 in 46 games) and the Binghamton Mets (with whom he hit .279 in 50 games). With Binghamton in 2011, he batted .247. With Binghamton again in 2012, he hit .297, earning a spot on the Eastern League Mid-Season All-Star team. He reached Triple-A for the first time in 2013, hitting .314 with 25 doubles, eight home runs and 66 RBI in 120 games for the Las Vegas 51s. Regard his big-league aspirations, Campbell told the Norwich Bulletin in 2013: \"You think about it [a promotion] constantly, but you also understand that it's out of your control and the only thing you can do is go out and play hard. I've said it before: Nobody plays baseball to play in Triple-A. Everybody wants to play in the big leagues.\" Campbell was described by his coaches as a cerebral and quiet player who took a while to gain his swing in the minors. After feeling that he had not received enough playing time on the Cyclones, Campbell approached Edgardo Alfonzo, his manager, and volunteered to play the outfield, ushering in a new era of versatility for his professional career. Wally Backman, Campbell's onetime manager in Las Vegas, agreed, saying that Campbell \"didn't care where he played, he just wanted to play.\" As a minor leaguer, Campbell developed a solid work ethic which enabled him to be versatile and yet skilled; he would eat peanut butter sandwiches and drink protein shakes before arriving at the ballpark early each day to practice fielding both on the infield and outfield and to take practice swings in the batting cage. Campbell also honed his hitting technique in the minors, where he learned to quiet his swings, pay attention to his hand position and study opposing pitchers. In one game in 2013, Campbell came in to pitch for the 51s, giving up 4 runs on a walk and 4 hits (including a home run) in one inning, which he ended by striking out Nolan Arenado.\n2014.\nCampbell was promoted to the Mets from Las Vegas on May 10, 2014, in what his father Hugh described as a \"glorious weekend\". He made his debut batting against the Philadelphia Phillies in the bottom of the sixth inning pinch-hitting for Lucas Duda with the bases loaded, hitting a sac-fly to right fielder Marlon Byrd on a 1–0 count driving in Daniel Murphy for his first major league RBI off pitcher Jake Diekman. On May 11, Campbell got his first major league hit, a single in the bottom of the fourth inning off pitcher Cole Hamels. On May 21, he hit his first major league homerun, a two-run home run off Los Angeles Dodgers' pitcher Hyun-jin Ryu.\nOn July 7, during a game between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets at Citi Field, in the bottom of the 9th inning and the game tied at three, Juan Lagares bunted towards third base to advance base runner Eric Campbell to second base. Braves third baseman Chris Johnson fielded the ball and threw to shortstop Andrelton Simmons, who was covering second base. Simmons was in no danger of being hit by the runner, yet the umpires ruled the runner out, calling it was a neighborhood play. Mets manager Terry Collins argued that it could not have been a neighborhood play, since it was a bunt play and recording a double play would be almost impossible. Simmons was moving away from 2nd base, and didn't record an out at 1st, either. Therefore, Collins claimed the only reason Simmons had to come off the base was an errant throw. The umpires accepted the claim and reviewed the play, and after review the out call was overturned. This led to an argument and ejection of Braves manager Fredi González, who later said about the call that it was one of the worst calls he'd seen in his life. The Mets would go on to win the game 4–3 in 11 innings.\nCampbell finished the 2014 season appearing in 85 games with a batting average of .263 in 190 at-bats. He had 50 hits, 16 RBIs, 3 home runs, 17 walks and 16 runs scored, while striking out 55 times.\n2015.\nBefore the 2015 season, Campbell learned how to catch; although he had never previously caught professionally, he said that \"if another position needs to be added, I'm all for it.\" Campbell began the 2015 season with the 51s. On April 15, Campbell was called up to the Mets after David Wright was placed on the disabled list with a strained right hamstring. On May 5, he was demoted to make room for catcher Johnny Monell on the roster. He was recalled to the Mets replacing Dilson Herrera who was placed on the DL due to a fractured tip of his middle finger on May 15. On August 10, he was sent back to the 51s to make room for Michael Cuddyer coming off the 15-day disabled list. He was recalled on September 1 due to expanded rosters.\nCampbell finished the 2015 season appearing in 71 games with a batting average of .197 in 173 at-bats. He had 34 hits, 19 RBIs, 3 home runs, 26 walks and 28 runs scored, while striking out 37 times. \"The Wall Street Journal\" dubbed Campbell \"baseball's unluckiest hitter\" in 2015 based on statistics compiled by Inside Edge which showed that his rate of \"well-hit\" balls was much higher than his actual batting average.\n2016.\nCampbell made the Mets' roster for Opening Day in 2016. On April 12, Campbell was demoted after making three appearances primarily as a Pinch runner and Pinch hitter to make room for Rafael Montero. Campbell was promoted again when Jacob deGrom was placed on the Family Emergency List three days later. On May 3, Campbell teamed up with Mets oufielder Curtis Granderson to read books (such as Green Eggs and Ham and If You Give a Pig a Pancake) to children at Corona, Queens' P.S. 92, following in the footsteps of former readers Wilmer Flores, Daniel Murphy, Bobby Parnell, Sean Gilmartin, Josh Edgin and Kirk Nieuwenhuis. On May 31, Campbell was demoted back to the 51s to make room for newly acquired first baseman James Loney. Campbell was batting .159 with one home run and five RBIs in 30 games. After the conclusion of the Triple-A season, Campbell was called back up to the Major Leagues. He was outrighted off the 40-man roster on November 2, 2016, assigned to the Triple-A Las Vegas 51s; after his outrighting, Campbell declared free agency.\nHanshin Tigers.\nIn December 2016, Campbell signed with the Hanshin Tigers of Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League. Campbell described his decision to go play in Japan one motivated by a need for a \"change of scenery\"; he also commented that his game had become rusty after a few years of irregular playing time in the Mets organization.\n2017.\nCampbell began spring training with the rest of the Tigers on February 1, 2017, but was soon sidelined by an injured wrist in an intrasquad game. Diagnosed with an inflamed left wrist, Campbell began his first season in Japan hurt. He hit .191/.296/.298 with 1 home run and 5 RBI with Hanshin before being released on January 25, 2018.\nMiami Marlins.\nOn February 17, 2018, Campbell signed a minor league contract with the Miami Marlins and was invited to participate in spring training. He was named a Pacific Coast League All-Star. He finished the season second in the league in on-base percentage. In 95 games for the Triple–A New Orleans Baby Cakes, Campbell hit .313/.420/.445 with 6 home runs and 68 RBI. He elected free agency following the season on November 2.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn January 24, 2019, Campbell signed a minor league deal with the Oakland Athletics. Campbell re-signed with Oakland on November 25, 2019. Campbell was invited to spring training with Oakland in 2020. He was added to the team's 60-man player pool in July. He became a free agent on November 2, 2020.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn May 12, 2021, Campbell signed a minor league contract with the Seattle Mariners organization. On May 21, Campbell was selected to the active roster. In the game, Campbell made his first MLB appearance since 2016, notching a single against San Diego Padres starter Chris Paddack in his only at-bat. Campbell went 3-for-11 in 4 games for Seattle before being outrighted off of the 40-man roster on June 2. Campbell retired from professional baseball on July 28, 2021.\nCoaching career.\nOn April 29, 2021, Campbell, a native of Norwich, Connecticut, was hired to be the manager of the Norwich Sea Unicorns of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League for their 2021 season. However he stepped down before ever coaching a game when he was offered a minor league deal by the Seattle Mariners and soon returned to the major leagues.\nSmall Business Owner.\nAs of 2022, Campbell, owns and operates Lumber2Leather, a training facility for Baseball and Softball athletes.\nPersonal life.\nCampbell married his childhood sweetheart, Kristin Hammond."

As a senior, he tied John Drennen for most career home runs in the San Diego section with 47. After the season, he won \"Baseball America\"s High School Player of the Year Award.\nProfessional career.\nSeattle Mariners.\nJackson was highly touted as the best hitter in the 2014 Major League Baseball draft. The Seattle Mariners selected him in the first round, with the sixth overall pick.

        "title": "2015 NBA Finals",
        "text": "The 2015 NBA Finals was the championship series of the National Basketball Association's (NBA) 2014–15 season and the conclusion of the season's playoffs played from June 4 to 16, 2015. It was contested by the Western Conference champion Golden State Warriors and the Eastern Conference champion Cleveland Cavaliers.\nThe Warriors, led by the duo of Klay Thompson and 2014–15 MVP Stephen Curry, won the opening game at home in overtime. However, despite the loss of an injured Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving during most of the series, the Cavaliers, led by LeBron James (in his fifth consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall) managed to take a 2–1 series lead before the Warriors won the last three for their first title since 1975.\nGolden State's Andre Iguodala was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP). Iguodala received 7 of the 11 votes, with LeBron James receiving the other 4. James also became the first player in NBA Finals history to lead both teams in points, assists, and rebounds for the entire series. This is the last NBA Finals to be played on a Thursday–Sunday–Tuesday scheme, with the schedule format being changed beginning the following Finals.\nBackground.\nGolden State Warriors.\nThe Warriors entered the 2014–15 season after replacing Mark Jackson with Steve Kerr as head coach. This was Kerr's first ever head coaching job. After retiring as a player in 2003, he served as a broadcast analyst from 2003 to 2007 and 2010 to 2014, and as general manager of the Phoenix Suns from 2007 to 2010. Revamping Golden State's offense, Kerr employed elements of the triangle offense from his playing days with the Chicago Bulls under Phil Jackson, the spacing and pace of Gregg Popovich from his playing days in San Antonio with the Spurs, and the uptempo principles Alvin Gentry used in Phoenix when Kerr was the GM.\nIn Kerr's first year, the Warriors finished with the best regular season record at 67–15, including an incredible 39–2 in home games. Kerr became the winningest rookie head coach in NBA history, passing Tom Thibodeau and his 62 wins with the Chicago Bulls in 2010–11. Point guard Stephen Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 286, eclipsing his own record set in 2012–13. Curry also won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for the 2014–15 season. He and fellow guard Klay Thompson, known as the Splash Brothers, finished first and second in the league in three-pointers made, respectively, and combined to make 525 threes, surpassing their previous league record for a duo by 41, while also converting an impressive 44% of those shots. During the season, the backcourt mates both started in the NBA All-Star Game and were each named to the All-NBA team, the first time in decades that either has been achieved by guards on the same team. Golden State advanced to the Finals after sweeping the New Orleans Pelicans in the first round of the playoffs, defeating the Memphis Grizzlies in six games during the second round, and eliminating the Houston Rockets in five games in the conference finals.\nCleveland Cavaliers.\nThe Cavaliers entered the 2014–15 season after firing Mike Brown and replacing him with David Blatt as head coach, signing free agent forward LeBron James, and trading for forward Kevin Love. James previously played for Cleveland from 2003 to 2010, leading the Cavaliers to their only previous Finals appearance in 2007. James then played for the Miami Heat from 2010 to 2014, leading the Heat to two NBA championships in 2012 and 2013. During the 2014 NBA draft on June 26, 2014, Cleveland held the first overall pick and used it to select Andrew Wiggins. Later on August 23, a three-team trade was completed involving the Cavaliers, the Minnesota Timberwolves, and the Philadelphia 76ers. As part of the deal, Cleveland dealt Wiggins and Anthony Bennett and received Love.\nJames, Love, and guard Kyrie Irving became known as the Big Three. The Cavaliers got off to a shockingly bad start that led to intense media scrutiny and caused many to question Blatt's job security, going 19–20 in their first 39 games, which included a stretch where they were 2–10 in 12 games, starting with a December 25 road loss to Miami. Injuries to James and \"chemistry issues,\" with James \"still learning how to play with his new teammates and vice versa,\" were considered the primary reasons for the underwhelming start. A number of trades turned the season around. The Cavaliers acquired J.R. Smith and Iman Shumpert from the Knicks in exchange for draft picks while sending Dion Waiters to the Thunder. They then acquired Timofey Mozgov. James's return to the Cavaliers' lineup (following a 2-week layoff) on January 12 completed the turnaround. The Cavaliers closed out the season on a high note, going 34–9 for a 53–29 regular season record and the Central Division title, the second best record in the Eastern Conference behind the Atlanta Hawks. The Cavaliers advanced to the Finals after sweeping the Boston Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, defeating the Chicago Bulls in six games during the second round, and sweeping the Hawks in the conference finals.\nRegular season series.\nThe Cavaliers and Warriors tied the regular season series 1–1, with each team winning its home game.\nGame summaries.\nFor the first time in NBA Finals history, the first two games went into overtime. In Game Four, after Golden State had fallen behind 2–1 in the series, Kerr moved swingman Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup and brought center Andrew Bogut off the bench. The Warriors' small lineup, which came to be known as the Death Lineup, helped turn the series around. Golden State won the series in six games, claiming their first title since 1975 and their fourth in franchise history. They played small ball in the Finals to a greater extent than any prior champion. Combining regular season and playoff games, the Warriors finished 83–20, the third-best record ever behind the Chicago Bulls in 1995–96 (87–13) and 1996–97 (84–17).\nIguodala was named the Finals MVP, becoming the first to win the award without having started every game in the series. He averaged 16.3 points, four assists, and 5.8 rebounds per game in the series. Iguodala was also tasked with guarding Cleveland star LeBron James, who made only 38.1% of his shots when Iguodala was in the game, but still averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists. James received 4 of the 11 votes for Finals MVP even though Cleveland lost by an average of 14 points in the final three games. Stephen Curry was just the sixth player to win his first league MVP and his first NBA title in the same season; the last player to accomplish this feat was Shaquille O'Neal in 1999–2000. Kerr became the first rookie coach to win a title since Pat Riley in 1981–82.\nThe Warriors were the first team since the 1990–91 Bulls to win a title with a roster that did not have any players with Finals experience. James and teammate James Jones made their fifth consecutive trip to the Finals, having qualified the previous four seasons with the Miami Heat, though Jones did not play in the 2011 Finals. It was the first time since 1998 that the Finals did not include the Los Angeles Lakers, the San Antonio Spurs, or the Heat. This was also the first NBA Finals since then not to have featured Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, or Dwyane Wade.\nGame 1.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 108–100 in overtime, taking Game 1 and the 1–0 series lead. The Cavaliers got off to a strong start, opening up a 29–15 lead before settling for a 10-point lead after the 1st quarter. In the 2nd quarter, the Warriors went on a big run and led 46–41. The Cavaliers then went on a 10–2 run to close out the first half, capped off by a J. R. Smith three with .7 seconds left. The Cavaliers led 51–48 at halftime. The second half was a back and forth affair, with neither team able to gain separation. Late in the 4th, Timofey Mozgov hit two free throws to tie the game at 98. The Warriors ran a play for Stephen Curry out of a timeout. Curry beat Kyrie Irving to the basket and went for a go-ahead layup, but Irving blocked the shot, and the Cavaliers called timeout after Smith secured the rebound. \nThe Cavaliers had two chances to win in the final seconds of regulation. James's potential game-winning jumper was off, and then Iman Shumpert got the offensive rebound and threw a shot at the buzzer, but also missed, sending the game to overtime. In overtime, the Warriors dominated with a 10–0 run consisting of 7 free throws and a three-pointer by Barnes. Cleveland's only score in the extra period was James's layup with 9.5 seconds left as the Cavaliers shot 1/12 and committed 3 turnovers in the game's final 5 minutes.\nOnly three players scored for the Cavaliers after halftime: James, Irving, and Mozgov. The trio combined for 83 of the Cavaliers' 100 points. James had a career NBA Finals high of 44 points, while attempting a postseason career-high 38 shots, and Curry led Golden State with 26 points. The Warriors' bench outplayed the Cavaliers' bench, outscoring them 34–9, with all 9 Cavaliers bench points coming from Smith. Andre Iguodala led the Warriors bench in scoring with 15 points. Irving suffered a knee injury in overtime and was forced to leave the game early. The following day, he was diagnosed with a fractured left kneecap that would require surgery and was ruled out for the rest of the Finals, joining Kevin Love, who suffered a dislocated shoulder against the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, and Anderson Varejão.\nGame 2.\nThe Cavaliers defeated the Warriors 95–93 in overtime, tying the series at 1–1 and stealing homecourt advantage heading into Cleveland. For the first time in NBA Finals history, the first two games were decided in overtime, with the Cavaliers winning their first Finals game in franchise history. LeBron James tallied his fifth Finals triple-double with 39 points, 16 rebounds, and 11 assists while moving solely into second all-time in Finals triple-doubles behind Magic Johnson's 8. James, who shot 11-for-35 in the game, played 50 minutes and led all scorers. James either scored or assisted on 66 of Cleveland's 95 points, and his 83 points in the first two games of a Finals was also second all-time to Jerry West's 94 in the 1969 Finals. Klay Thompson led the Warriors with 34 points. Curry added 19, but he struggled mightily against the Cavaliers' defense, shooting 5-for-23 from the floor, including 2–15 from 3-point range. Curry set an NBA record for most missed three-point attempts in an Finals game with 13. Matthew Dellavedova's defense on Curry was huge as Curry was 0–for-8 against him.\nThe margin was close through the first three quarters, with neither team leading by more than 8 points. The Warriors jumped out to a 20–12 lead, but the Cavaliers closed the quarter on an 8–0 run to tie the game at 20. The Warriors led 31–25 early in the 2nd quarter, but the Cavaliers went on a 15–2 run to take a 40–33 lead. They settled for a 2-point lead at halftime, leading 47–45. The third quarter was low scoring, with the Cavaliers scoring 15 points and the Warriors 14 points. Heading into the 4th quarter, the Cavaliers led 62–59. After three tight quarters, the Cavaliers began to pull away, building an 83–72 lead with just over 3 minutes remaining in the fourth. However, the Cavaliers squandered the 11-point lead as the Warriors went on a 15–4 run to tie the game at 87, capped off by a Curry finger roll layup with eight seconds remaining. Out of a timeout, James drove towards the basket as he went for a game winning layup, but he misfired, and the rebound tipback attempt by Tristan Thompson was unsuccessful.\nIn the overtime, Iman Shumpert hit a three-pointer, and James made two free throws, giving the Cavaliers a 92–87 lead. However, Draymond Green answered with back-to-back baskets, and Curry hit two free throws to give the Warriors a 93–92 lead. Out of the timeout, James's go-ahead layup was blocked by Green and recovered by Andre Iguodala, but he threw it out of bounds, giving possession back to the Cavaliers. The ensuing Cavaliers possession resulted in a three-point attempt by James Jones which missed, but Dellavedova grabbed the offensive rebound and was fouled. Dellavedova hit both free throws to give the Cavaliers a 94–93 lead with 10.1 seconds remaining. After a timeout, the Warriors went to Curry, who airballed the potential go-ahead jumper. James rebounded the miss and was fouled.\nJames hit one of two at the line, giving the Cavaliers a 95–93 lead with 4 seconds left in overtime. With no timeouts remaining, the Warriors had to go the length of the court to get off a game-tying or game-winning shot attempt. However, Curry's pass near midcourt was stolen by Tristan Thompson, and the Cavaliers ran out the clock. After getting badly outplayed in Game 1, the Cavaliers' bench outscored the Warriors 21–17 in Game 2. The Cavaliers handed the Warriors their 4th home loss of the season (including the postseason) and were only the second Eastern Conference team to win at Oracle Arena (the Chicago Bulls also won in overtime on January 27). The victory for the Cleveland Cavaliers was their first ever single game Finals victory, having lost Game 1 of this series, and being swept in the 2007 Finals by the San Antonio Spurs.\nFollowing the game, James had dubbed the undermanned Cavaliers as \"The Grit Squad\", due to adopting a slower paced, more physical style of play in the absence of All-Stars Irving and Kevin Love. This new moniker was quickly embraced by Cavaliers fans, in hopes that this new tough style of play would be enough to offset the Warriors' depth advantage.\nGame 3.\nThe Cavaliers led wire to wire as they defeated the Warriors 96–91 and took a 2–1 series lead. The first half was close throughout, with the Cavaliers leading 24–20 after the first quarter. They led 44–37 at halftime. Stephen Curry's struggles in Game 2 carried over to the first half of this game as he was held to 3 points in the first half. In the third quarter, the Cavaliers seized control, outscoring the Warriors 28–18. They led by as many as 20 in the third quarter before taking a 72–55 lead heading into the fourth quarter. The 55 points scored by the Warriors was their lowest scoring output through three quarters all season. However, the Warriors fought back, making it a 1-point game as they cut the deficit to 81–80 late in the fourth quarter. However, Matthew Dellavedova banked in a circus shot as he tumbled to the floor while being fouled by Curry. He made the free throw to put the Cavaliers up 84–80. After Curry committed a turnover, LeBron James hit a three-pointer to give the Cavs an 87–80 lead. Curry hit a handful of three-pointers down the stretch, but the Cavs made their free throws and closed out the win.\nJames led all scorers with 40 to go along with 12 rebounds, 8 assists, and 4 steals. Through 3 games, James scored 123 points, the most points scored by any player in the first three games of any NBA Finals series, surpassing Rick Barry's 122 from the 1967 NBA Finals. Dellavedova scored 20, a playoff career high. Curry led the Warriors with 27 points, 17 of which came in the fourth quarter. This win marks the first time that the Cavaliers held a lead in a Finals series in their franchise history, as well as their first home win in a Finals series in their franchise history.\nGame 4.\nThe Warriors routed the Cavaliers 103–82 in Game 4, evening the series at 2–2 and reclaiming homecourt advantage. Despite stating that there would be no changes to the starting lineup the morning of Game 4, Kerr inserted Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of Andrew Bogut, while moving Draymond Green to the center position. The Cavaliers scored the first seven points of the game and led 16–9, but the Warriors closed out the first quarter on a 22–8 run to lead 31–24. In the second quarter, the Cavaliers got a scare when LeBron James suffered a laceration on his head from a courtside photographer's camera lens after a hard foul on Bogut, but he stayed in the game without any stitches. The Warriors outscored the Cavaliers 23–18 in that period and led 54–42 at halftime. The Cavaliers outscored the Warriors 28–22 in the third quarter as they cut a 15-point deficit down to 3 in two instances. The Cavaliers had it down to 65–62, but Harrison Barnes hit a three-pointer out of the timeout to stop the run.\nWith the Warriors leading 73–70 late in the third quarter, Stephen Curry hit a three to give the Warriors a 76–70 lead heading into the fourth quarter. The Warriors dominated the final period, leading by as many as 23 as they outscored the Cavaliers 27–12. The Cavaliers shot 4-for-27 from behind the 3-point line for the game and were 6–45 outside the paint, a season worst. The 82 points that the Cavaliers scored were a postseason low while the Cavaliers' bench scoring production (7 points) was also a postseason low. Curry and Iguodala led the Warriors in scoring with 22 apiece. Timofey Mozgov led the Cavaliers with 28. After averaging 41 points in the first three games of the Finals, James was held to 20 points on 7–22 shooting. After the game, Kerr admitted to his deception regarding the starting lineup, quipping, \"I don't think they hand you the trophy based on morality.\"\nGame 5.\nComing into this game with the series tied at 2 games apiece, the Game 5 winner had gone on to win the NBA championship in 20 of the previous 28 instances.\nThe Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 104–91 and took a 3–2 series lead heading back to Cleveland.\nThe first three quarters were tight, with neither team leading by more 7. Both teams scored 22 points in the 1st quarter. The Warriors led 51–50 at halftime on a Harrison Barnes' three-point play following a dunk. They took a 6-point lead into the 4th quarter, leading 73–67. The Cavaliers opened the 4th quarter on a 13–6 run. LeBron James' deep three-pointer gave the Cavaliers an 80–79 lead with just over 7:30 remaining in the 4th quarter. However, the Warriors responded with a huge run, outscoring the Cavaliers 25–11 the rest of the way. Curry scored 37 points on 13–23 shooting in the victory, including 7–13 from 3-point range. 17 of his 37 points came in the 4th quarter. \nJames had his second triple-double of this NBA Finals series, posting 40 points, 14 rebounds, and 11 assists. James led all players in points, rebounds and assists, and was responsible for 70 of 91 Cavaliers points (40 scored, 30 assisted). It was his sixth career finals triple double, second all-time behind only Magic Johnson with 8. James also tied Oscar Robertson for most 30–10–10 playoff games with 8. He became the second player in NBA Finals history to score 40 points in a triple double after Jerry West in 1969.\nGame 6.\nThe Warriors finished off the Cavaliers 105–97, winning the series 4–2. The Warriors outscored the Cavaliers 28–15 in the 1st quarter. However, the Cavaliers went on a big run to cut the deficit to 2 at halftime, trailing 45–43. The Cavaliers led 47–45 early in the third quarter, their only lead of the second half. \nHowever, the Warriors outscored the Cavaliers 28–18 in the 3rd quarter, leading by as many 15 before taking a 12-point lead into the 4th, leading 73–61. In the 4th quarter, the Cavaliers cut the deficit down to 7, but the Warriors pushed the lead back to 15.\nThe Cavaliers, led by J.R. Smith, made a late surge to cut it to 4 with under 40 seconds remaining. However, the Warriors hit their free throws and closed out the series, giving the franchise their first title since 1975, and the city of Oakland its first major league sports championship since the Oakland Athletics won the 1989 World Series.\nAndre Iguodala, who did not start for the Warriors until Game 4 of the Finals, was named the Finals MVP for his instrumental defense against LeBron James, who led the Cavaliers with 32 points. Iguodala had the third lowest scoring average of any Finals MVP in NBA history. James became the youngest player to score 5000 career points in the playoffs.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the NBA Finals aired on ABC with Mike Breen as play-by-play commentator, and Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy serving as color commentators.

The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nSweden have been one of the more successful national teams in the history of the World Cup, having reached the top four on four occasions, and becoming runners-up on home ground in 1958. They have been present at 12 out of 21 World Cups by 2018.\nThroughout the World Cup history, Brazil became Sweden's historical rival. The two countries have met each other seven times but Sweden never won, with five victories for the Brazilian side and two draws. Another historical opponent of Sweden in the finals is (West) Germany: four encounters, with three wins for Germany and one for Sweden.\nTop goalscorers.\nWith his five goals in 1994, Kennet Andersson won the shared Bronze Boot at that tournament."

In 2013 Virginia Golf Club celebrated its 85-year anniversary and underscored its place as one of Queensland's oldest and most time honoured courses. Two of its Club Champions from the 1970s would later win major championships – Greg Norman and Wayne Grady.\nHistory.\nIn 1928, the Chief Engineer for the Queensland Main Roads Commission, D.A. Crawford, designed a nine-hole golf course on public land at Virginia. Brothers Jack and Bert Roach were contracted to clear the area of unwanted trees, shrubs and heavy undergrowth. Their only tools were axes, shovels, a plough, and a horse and cart. Volunteers helped clear weeds and build the tees and greens. The course was playable by the end of October 1929 and was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, William Jolly on Saturday 6 December 1930.\nA second nine-hole course was designed by D. A. Crawford and opened on Saturday 2 September 1933.\nIn December 1946, 15-year-old caddie, Leo Lofthouse, won the Courier Mail's Caddies' Cup at Virginia. Not only was his round of 71 a record for amateurs on the course, it was also a better score than any professional who played the course that year.\nThe Club acquired an additional 72 acres of freehold land for the sum of £7,250 in June 1959. The land was purchased by Jim Wilson, a Club member, as it was felt that the original owner of the land would not sell directly to the Club. Wilson took control of the land in April 1958 and subsequently transferred title to the Virginia Golf Club.\nThe new land was cleared during 1963 with Al Howard, a course architect from Sydney, and Norman Von Nida, a three-time Australian Open champion, appointed to design a 27-hole layout. The current clubhouse was opened by the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Clem Jones, in September 1969 and the redesign of the course was fully complete by October 1970. Aside from a few small changes to the third nine which were made in 1992, this layout is still used today.\nBetween 1980 and 1988, the Club converted its greens from couch grass to Tifgreen 328 Bermuda. The grass was chosen because of its fairer putting surface and its long wearing qualities that could cope with a sub-tropical climate.\nIn 2012, Wayne Grady Golf Design was appointed to redesign the current layout. These changes are expected to be made gradually over the next 20 years."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Memphis Tigers men's basketball team represented the University of Memphis in the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, the 94th season of Tiger basketball. The Tigers, led by sixth year head coach Josh Pastner, played their home games at the FedExForum. The 2014–15 season was the second season the Tigers participated in the American Athletic Conference. The Tigers didn't play in a postseason tournament, the first time in 15 years.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2013–14 Memphis Tigers finished the season with an overall record of 24–10 and 12–6 in AAC play to finish in a three way tie for third place in conference. They lost in the quarterfinals of the AAC tournament to eventual national champion UConn. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament's East Region as an 8 seed where they defeated 9 seed George Washington in the second round before losing in the third round to 1 seed Virginia.\nSeason summary.\nThe Tigers entered the 2014-15 season with only one senior, incoming transfer Calvin Godfrey. The young Tigers toured Canada in August 2014 and were thus permitted extra practice time. The Tigers faced teams from the University of Ottawa, Carleton University, and McGill University on the trip in exhibition matches. Immediately before the Canadian tour, guard/forward Damien Wilson then center Dominic Woodson successively announced that they were transferring away from Memphis. However, upon the team's return from Canada, former Vanderbilt point guard Kedren Johnson announced his intention to transfer to Memphis.\nAt the AAC media day on October 29, Memphis was picked to finish third in the league behind UConn and SMU. Shaq Goodwin and Austin Nichols were both named to the preseason all-AAC first team.\nThe Tigers lost their sole exhibition game against Division 2 Christian Brothers, marking the first exhibition game loss for the team since 1996. On November 24, after the team's second game of the season, true freshman point guard Dominic Magee announced his intent to transfer. Magee did not any playing time for the Tigers before his transfer. The Tigers dropped 4 of their first 7 games of the year, starting the year with their worst record since 2000.\nOn January 6, sophomore Kuran Iverson was suspended for the team's next two games against SMU and Houston, marking Iverson's second suspension of the season. After his suspension and subsequent actions, including using Twitter to make negative statements about Coach Pastner, it was reported that Iverson was not expected to return to the team and the University subsequently announced Iverson's dismissal from the basketball program. Junior forward Trahson Burrell was suspended for the team's January 8 game against SMU, reportedly in part for supporting Iverson's actions prior to his suspension.\nOn February 7 against Temple, Austin Nichols injured his ankle and had to be helped off the floor. The Tigers went on to lose the game without Nichols, who was later diagnosed with a moderately sprained ankle which was expected to prevent him from playing for the next two weeks. However, Nichols was able to return on February 19 at home against UConn before injuring the ankle again on February 28 early in the second half against Tulsa. The second ankle injury caused Nichols to miss the remainder of the season. Despite his injury and subsequent absence, Nichols finished the season with 93 blocks, the 5th highest single season block total all time for a Tiger.\nThe Tigers finished the regular season in 5th place in the American. Austin Nichols was named to the All-AAC first team. In the AAC tournament, the Tigers lost their opening matchup to 4 seed Temple.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0C1C8C; color:#8E9295;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0C1C8C; color:#8E9295;\"| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#0C1C8C; color:#8E9295;\"| American Athletic Conference tournament"

        "text": "Christopher Riley Martin (born June 2, 1986) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Colorado Rockies, New York Yankees, Texas Rangers, Atlanta Braves, Chicago Cubs and Los Angeles Dodgers and in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) for the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters.\nMartin played baseball at Arlington High School and McLennan Community College, but gave up on baseball after he suffered a shoulder injury. After working in a warehouse for three years, Martin began playing catch, and felt strong enough to try out for independent league baseball. After he pitched for the Grand Prairie AirHogs in 2010, the Boston Red Sox of MLB signed Martin in 2011. He pitched in Minor League Baseball for the Red Sox organization, until they traded him to the Rockies after the 2013 season.\nMartin made his MLB debut for the Rockies in 2014, and was traded to the Yankees after the season. He signed with the Fighters after the 2015 season, and won the 2016 Japan Series with the Fighters. He signed with the Rangers after the 2017 season. The Rangers traded Martin to the Braves during the 2019 season, and he was a part of the 2021 World Series championship team.\nAmateur career.\nMartin attended Arlington High School in Arlington, Texas, where he pitched for the school's baseball team. In 2004, his senior year, the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association named Martin to its Class 5A All-State team. The Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball (MLB) selected him in the 18th round of the 2004 MLB draft, but Martin did not sign a professional contract.\nMartin enrolled at McLennan Community College, where he played college baseball for the McLennan Highlanders. After his freshman year at McLennan, he received interest from the college baseball programs representing the University of Oklahoma and the University of Texas at Austin. However, he did not have enough course credits to transfer.\nThe Colorado Rockies of MLB selected Martin in the 21st round of the 2005 MLB draft. He returned to McLennan for his sophomore season, with the Rockies following his progress while deciding whether or not to offer him a contract. Martin suffered a shoulder injury while pitching for McLennan as a sophomore, and the Rockies opted not to offer him a contract. Martin was diagnosed with a torn labrum in the shoulder of his pitching arm, and he underwent surgery to correct it.\nProfessional career.\nIndependent leagues (2006–2010).\nMartin was not selected in the 2006 MLB draft. After graduating from McLennan, Martin signed with the Fort Worth Cats of the United League Baseball, which is independent of MLB, for the 2007 season. Though Martin made the team out of their tryout camp, he did not pitch in a game for the Cats due to discomfort in his shoulder. A doctor recommended Martin undergo surgery to repair the labrum and the articular capsule of the humerus. Rather than undergo surgery, Martin quit professional baseball. He went to work loading trucks for UPS at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, moving refrigerators for Lowe's, and stocking washing machines and clothes dryers in an appliance warehouse in Arlington.\nMartin and Jordan Bostick, a coworker in the warehouse and a former high school baseball teammate, began playing catch in the warehouse. Martin noticed that his shoulder felt stronger, and with encouragement from Bostick, he agreed to attempt to play professional baseball again.\nIn 2010, after three years out of baseball, Martin tried out with the Grand Prairie AirHogs of the independent American Association of Independent Professional Baseball. Martin threw fastballs at before he was pulled aside by Pete Incaviglia, the AirHogs manager, and signed to a contract. He made his debut for the AirHogs that night. He had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 1.96 earned run average (ERA) for the AirHogs.\nBoston Red Sox (2011–2013).\nIncaviglia started contacting MLB teams to promote Martin. Before the 2011 season, the Boston Red Sox offered him a tryout during spring training. After practicing at their training facility, the Red Sox signed Martin to a minor league contract. The Red Sox assigned Martin to the Greenville Drive of the Class A South Atlantic League to begin the 2011 season. Later in the year, the Red Sox promoted Martin to the Salem Red Sox of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League and then the Portland Sea Dogs of the Class AA Eastern League. Across the three levels, Martin had a 6–2 win–loss record and 2.55 ERA in 23 appearances.\nThe Red Sox assigned Martin to Portland in 2012. He began the season as a starting pitcher, but was moved back to a relief role later in the season. He ended the 2012 season with a 4.48 ERA. In 2013, Martin worked exclusively in relief. He had a 5–3 win–loss record with a 2.25 ERA and five saves in 42 games pitched, split between Portland and the Pawtucket Red Sox of the Class AAA International League during the 2013 season.\nColorado Rockies (2014).\nAfter the 2013 season, the Red Sox traded Martin, along with pitcher Franklin Morales, to the Colorado Rockies in exchange for infielder Jonathan Herrera. The Rockies insisted on Martin's inclusion in the trade. Martin began the 2014 season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox of the Class AAA Pacific Coast League.\nThe Rockies promoted Martin to the major leagues for the first time on April 25, 2014. Martin made his major league debut on April 26, pitching a scoreless inning against the Los Angeles Dodgers. He pitched a total of innings for Colorado, recording a 6.89 ERA while striking out 14 and allowing 22 hits, before the Rockies demoted Martin to Colorado Springs in June. He pitched the rest of the season for Colorado Springs, where he had a 4.39 ERA.\nDuring the 2014–15 offseason, the Rockies agreed to sign Nick Hundley. The Rockies designated Martin for assignment on January 5, 2015, in order to remove him from their 40-man roster, so that the Rockies could sign Hundley.\nNew York Yankees (2015).\nThe Rockies traded Martin to the New York Yankees on January 13, 2015, receiving cash considerations. Martin competed for a spot in the Yankees' bullpen in spring training, and was named to the Yankees' Opening Day roster.\nOn April 28, 2015, Martin recorded his first career save in a 4–2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Martin began the season with a 0–1 record and a 3.55 ERA in innings pitched across 15 appearances, before he went on the disabled list on May 9 due to tendinitis in his right elbow. The Yankees activated Martin from the disabled list on May 31, and optioned him to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the International League. The Yankees recalled Martin from the minor leagues on June 11 to fill in for the injured Andrew Miller, and optioned him back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre on June 19. He finished the 2015 season with a 0–2 record and a 5.66 ERA in 24 games pitched for the Yankees.\nHokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters (2016–2017).\nAfter the 2015 season, the Yankees sold the contractual rights to Martin to the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters of Nippon Professional Baseball's Pacific League for $750,000. At the time, he had a career 6.19 ERA in innings in MLB and a .318 batting average against.\nMartin succeeded Hirotoshi Masui in the role of closing pitcher for the Fighters in 2016. He made the Pacific League All-Star team, but injured his ankle in September. Martin missed the end of the regular season and the 2016 Japan Series, which the Fighters won. He finished the 2016 season with a 1.07 ERA and 21 saves. He appeared in 52 games, which was a personal single-season best.\nThe Fighters re-signed Martin for the 2017 season for ¥100 million (approximately US$). He had a 1.19 ERA in 40 appearances with the Fighters in 2017. Between his two seasons in Japan, Martin struck out 91 batters and walked 13 in innings. He credited his time with Hokkaido for helping him learn how to prepare himself between appearances with less input from coaches. He also learned how to throw a split-finger fastball from teammate Shohei Ohtani.\nTexas Rangers (2018–2019).\nOn December 15, 2017, Martin signed a two-year, $4 million contract with the Texas Rangers. He recorded a 4.54 ERA in innings pitched in 2018. After the 2018 season, Martin represented MLB in the 2018 MLB Japan All-Star Series from November 8–15. When Rangers' closer Shawn Kelley went on the injured list in May 2019, Martin filled in for him. Martin and José Leclerc received save opportunities when Kelley was injured in July. For the Rangers in 2019, Martin had a 3.08 ERA in 38 appearances; from May 24 to July 30, he had a 1.45 ERA.\nAtlanta Braves (2019–2021).\nOn July 30, the day before the 2019 trade deadline, the Rangers traded Martin to the Atlanta Braves in exchange for Kolby Allard. On September 11, Martin pitched an immaculate inning in the bottom of the seventh against the Philadelphia Phillies. He had a 4.08 ERA with Atlanta in 20 games after the trade, finishing the season with a 3.40 ERA and four saves in 58 total appearances. The Braves included Martin on their roster for the 2019 National League Division Series, but he injured an oblique muscle while warming up in Game 1 and was removed from the roster.\nA free agent after the 2019 season, Martin re-signed with Atlanta on a two-year contract worth $14 million on November 19. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he pitched to a 1.00 ERA in 19 relief appearances spanning 18 innings. In 2021, Martin had a 3.95 ERA in 46 relief appearances. During the 2021 postseason, Martin had a 2.08 ERA in five appearances as the Braves won the 2021 World Series.\nChicago Cubs (2022).\nOn March 17, 2022, Martin signed a one-year contract with the Chicago Cubs worth $2.5 million, with additional achievable incentives.

        "text": "Paul Bernard Thomas (born October 28, 1962) is an American college basketball coach who was most recently the women's basketball head coach at Saint Mary's College of California. He previously served as head coach at Hamline and Cal Poly Pomona.\nOriginally from Creighton, Nebraska, Thomas graduated from Wayne State College in Nebraska and began his coaching career in 1985 as an assistant coach at Wayne State College and a local high school. Thomas had his first head coaching position from 1988 to 1990 at Hamline, a largely unsuccessful stint with only one win in two seasons. He moved to California to be an assistant coach at Cal Poly Pomona for four years before being promoted to head coach, a position he held from 1994 to 2006. Thomas was far more successful at Cal Poly Pomona, leading the Broncos to two NCAA Division II national titles in 2001 and 2002 and five California Collegiate Athletic Association titles.\nFrom 2006 to 2022, Thomas was head coach at Saint Mary's, his first Division I coaching position. Thomas has over 250 wins at Saint Mary's in his first 14 seasons along with 10 consecutive appearances in the Women's National Invitation Tournament from 2010 to 2019.\nEarly life.\nThomas began playing basketball in Creighton, Nebraska. He would attend Creighton High School, where he played forward. While at Creighton, Thomas was made an all-state forward and named the 1981 Bulldogs Most Valuable Player.\nAfter high school, Thomas would spend the next two years at Midland Lutheran College in Fremont, Nebraska, then retired from basketball and transferred to Wayne State College to complete his education and pursue a coaching career. He completed his bachelor's degree in 1986 and master's degree in physical education in 1988. \nCoaching career.\nEarly coaching career (1984–1994).\nAs a student at Wayne State, Thomas began his coaching career in 1984 as an assistant coach for the Pender High School girls' team before serving as an assistant coach for the Wayne State women's basketball team from 1985 to 1988.\nIn 1988, Thomas entered his first head coaching position at Hamline University, an NCAA Division III school in Saint Paul, Minnesota. Hamline went 1–24 in his first season (1–19 MIAC) and 0–25 (0–20 MIAC) in 1989–90.\nThomas became an assistant coach again in 1990 at Cal Poly Pomona, where he would work for the next 16 years. From 1990 to 1994, Thomas was an assistant coach under head coach Darlene May. During that time, Cal Poly Pomona won three California Collegiate Athletic Association (CCAA) tournament titles from 1991 to 1993 and four regular season titles from 1991 to 1994.\nCal Poly Pomona (1994–2006).\nAfter the passing of May, Thomas was promoted to head coach of Cal Poly Pomona in 1994. Over the next 12 years, Thomas would compile a 235–108 record. Thomas would lead the Broncos to five additional CCAA championships and back-to-back Division II national championships (2001 and 2002). He would reach the Division II NCAA Tournament eight out of the 12 seasons with a 14–6 postseason record. He recruited and coached two National Players of the Year, six First Team Kodak All-Americans, four CCAA Players of the Year and 15 First Team All-Conference players all while winning the NCAA Division II National Coach of the Year and NCAA District 8 Coach of the Year in 2002.\nSaint Mary's (2006–2023).\nAfter 12 seasons at Cal Poly Pomona, Thomas resigned in August 2006 to become the eighth women's head coach at Division I Saint Mary's,a member of the West Coast Conference (WCC). Only by his fourth season did Thomas achieve a winning record at Saint Mary's at 21–10. That season was the start of 10 consecutive winning seasons with Women's National Invitation Tournament appearances from 2010 to 2019. In 2010–11, the Gaels finished second in the WCC tournament behind Gonzaga. The 2012–13 Gaels won 23 games and advanced to the 2013 WNIT quarterfinals, the furthest in the WNIT under Thomas.\nIn 2015, after a third-place finish in the WCC, Thomas was selected as one of three WCC co-of the year, along with Pacific coach Lynne Roberts and Gonzaga coach Lisa Fortier. The 2014–15 Gaels again finished the season with 23 wins and made the WNIT quarterfinals for the second time in three seasons. Thomas followed that season with a new career best 24 wins at Saint Mary's in 2015–16.\nHowever, following the 2019 Women's National Invitation Tournament, Saint Mary's had two consecutive losing seasons, finishing the 2019–20 season 12–19. In 2020–21, Saint Mary's was 7–19. As of his 15th season in 2020–21, Thomas has a 275–198 cumulative record at Saint Mary's.\nFollowing a 7–4 start to the 2022–23 season, Saint Mary's suspended Thomas in late December 2022 pending the results of an internal investigation and announced on January 30, 2023 that Thomas would no longer be head coach; assistant coach Allyson Fasnacht became interim head coach immediately.\nPersonal life.\nThomas resides in Concord, California with his wife and their four children. When he coached at Cal Poly Pomona, he and his family lived in the Phillips Ranch community of Pomona. They previously lived in Orinda when Thomas first got the job at Saint Mary's."

        "title": "Penalty shoot-out (field hockey)",
        "text": "A penalty shootout is a method used in field hockey to decide which team progresses to the next stage of a tournament (or wins the tournament) following a tied game. Two methods have been used: the original penalty stroke competition is a best-of-five penalty strokes with sudden death if scores were level after five strokes. An alternate penalty shoot-out competition was introduced at major tournaments in 2011. Sometimes known as a penalty shuffle, the method is similar to penalty shots in ice hockey and consists of one-on-ones between an attacking player and a goalkeeper. Up to 2013, up to two 7.5-minute golden goal periods were played first; that method ceased after.\nPenalty stroke competition (before 2011).\nTo determine matches that end in a tie, a penalty stroke competition was used. Similar to a penalty shoot-out in association football, teams alternately take penalty strokes, subject to the normal rules, to determine the winner. Each team is represented by any five players chosen from the team sheet submitted prior to the match and the order in which they participate is also chosen. Players from each team take alternate strokes in a best-of-five competition until a team has won or 10 strokes have been completed. The goal used is selected by the umpires and the team to take the first penalty stroke is determined by a coin toss. In the result of a tie after 10 strokes, the same players will continue to take strokes in a sudden death format until a winner is established. The order in which players take strokes may change and the team that started first in the shoot-out goes second for the duration of sudden death strokes.\nPenalty shoot-out competition (since 2011).\nSimilar to a penalty shot in ice hockey, the attacker gets a chance to run with the ball in a one-on-one situation against the goalkeeper. The attacker starts on the 23-metre line with the ball and the goalkeeper starts on the goal line. When the whistle is blown, both can move and the attacker has 8 seconds to score a goal. Unlike a penalty stroke or penalty corner there are no restrictions on strokes the attacker may use to score and a goal is scored in the usual way. If the attacker commits an offence, the ball travels outside the field of play, or 8 seconds elapse before the ball crosses the line a goal is not awarded. If the goalkeeper unintentionally fouls the attacker then the penalty shoot-out is re-taken; in the event the foul was intentional a penalty stroke is awarded.\nJust like its predecessor, the penalty shoot-out uses five players chosen from each team against a goalkeeper. It is a best-of-five competition and, if scores are tied at the end of this, it progresses to sudden-death with the same players until a winner is established. Which goal to use is chosen by umpires and which team starts is determined by a coin toss. Sudden-death is started by the team that did not start the shoot-out and players may proceed in a different order from the best-of-five.\nHistory.\nThe first Olympic match to be decided by a penalty stroke competition was during the 1972 Summer Olympics in the 11th-place classification match when Poland defeated France. Following the introduction of women's hockey to the Olympics in 1992, the first Olympic women's penalty stroke competition was at the 1996 Summer Olympics and decided the bronze medal match between Great Britain and the Netherlands. However, penalty strokes had already long been used in the Women's Hockey World Cup which started in 1974; notably, the winner (West Germany) of the 1981 final was determined by this method.\nPenalty shoot-outs using a one-on-one had previously been trialled in the Australian Hockey League since 2001. Alternate tie-breaking methods were also tested; these including a trial in domestic Australian leagues where an extra time situation was used where \"players from both teams are reduced gradually\" after a fixed amount of time—the idea being that this creates space for a goal to be scored. The Euro Hockey League used shoot-outs since its inaugural 2007–08 season and that year's match for third-place was determined using a shoot-out. The International Hockey Federation's view was that the shoot-outs \"better replicate real game situations and tend to require more skill\" and were a better method of tie-breaking.\nIn April 2011, the International Hockey Federation announced that a penalty shoot-out competition would replace the penalty stroke competition and the first major tournament to feature this tie-breaking procedure was the 2011 Women's Hockey Champions Challenge II; the first penalty shoot-out occurred in the 3rd place match with Belarus defeating Chile 3–1 in the shoot-out. The second shoot-out was used to determine the 3rd place match in 2011 Women's Hockey Champions Challenge I. The Champions Trophy is the premier annual hockey tournament and the first time a shoot-out was used in the competition was to determine the winner of the women's 2011 tournament; Netherlands won the shoot-out 3–2 against Argentina. The first Olympics to feature the penalty shoot-out was London 2012; they were not required in the men's tournament but was used once in the women's tournament where the Netherlands progressed from their semi-final against New Zealand."

It was her second Wimbledon title and she lost only one set en route, to Venus Williams in the third round.\nMarion Bartoli was the reigning champion, but retired from professional tennis in August 2013.\nLike at that year's French Open, the tournament was marked by two significant upsets. The top two seeds – Serena Williams and Li Na – both lost in the third round. This marked the first time in the Open Era that neither of the top two seeds at Wimbledon reached the fourth round. Five-time Wimbledon champion Williams' defeat equalled her earliest exit from the tournament (she lost at the same stage in 1998 and 2005). Two-time major champion Li fell to unseeded Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová, in what would be her final professional tennis match before she announced her retirement almost three months later.\nThe final.\nSixth-seeded Kvitová defeated her compatriot and 23rd-seeded Lucie Šafářová, 7–6(8–6), 6–1 in the first semifinal, while 13th-seeded Eugenie Bouchard defeated third-seeded Simona Halep, 7–6(7–5), 6–2 in the other. Bouchard, playing in only her sixth grand slam tournament, advanced to the final without losing a set, becoming the first Canadian tennis player to reach the singles final of a grand slam. The title match was the first grand slam final contested between two players born in the 1990s. In the first set, Kvitová broke in the third game and broke again in the seventh to establish a 5–2 lead. With Kvitová serving for the set, Bouchard broke back, but Kvitová did the same in the following game to take the first set 6–3. The second set saw Kvitová lose only three points on serve as she bagelled Bouchard 6–0. Only 10 other Wimbledon women singles champions lost \"fewer games in the final than Kvitova did\".\nThe victory gave Kvitová her second Wimbledon title and second Grand Slam title overall. After the tournament, Bouchard improved to a career-high World No. 7 in the WTA rankings, surpassing Carling Bassett-Seguso's record of being the highest-ranked Canadian woman of all-time, while Kvitová moved up to World No. 4.\nSeeds.\n Serena Williams \"(third round)\"\n Li Na \"(third round)\"\n Simona Halep \"(semifinals)\"\n Agnieszka Radwańska \"(fourth round)\"\n Maria Sharapova \"(fourth round)\"\n Petra Kvitová (champion)\n Jelena Janković \"(first round)\"\n Victoria Azarenka \"(second round)\"\n Angelique Kerber \"(quarterfinals)\"\n Dominika Cibulková \"(third round)\"\n Ana Ivanovic \"(third round)\"\n Flavia Pennetta \"(second round)\"\n Eugenie Bouchard \"(final)\"\n Sara Errani \"(first round)\"\n Carla Suárez Navarro \"(second round)\"\n Caroline Wozniacki \"(fourth round)\"\n Samantha Stosur \"(first round)\"\n Sloane Stephens \"(first round)\"\n Sabine Lisicki \"(quarterfinals)\"\n Andrea Petkovic \"(third round)\"\n Roberta Vinci \"(first round)\"\n Ekaterina Makarova \"(quarterfinals)\"\n Lucie Šafářová \"(semifinals)\"\n Kirsten Flipkens \"(third round)\"\n Alizé Cornet \"(fourth round)\"\n Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova \"(first round)\"\n Garbiñe Muguruza \"(first round)\"\n Svetlana Kuznetsova \"(first round)\"\n Sorana Cîrstea \"(first round)\"\n Venus Williams \"(third round)\"\n Klára Koukalová \"(second round)\"\n Elena Vesnina \"(second round)\""

        "title": "Xu Xin (table tennis)",
        "text": "Xu Xin (; born 8 January 1990) is a Chinese professional table tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 103 as of May 2023 for men's singles by the International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF). He first reached his career-high singles ranking of world No. 1 in January 2013.\nHe is Vice Chairman of the Asian Table Tennis Federation.\nHe has won 17 World Tour Singles titles and has won the World Championships in men's doubles thrice, mixed doubles twice, and five times in the team event. In addition, Xu Xin along with Ma Long and Zhang Jike won the men's team gold medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nPlaying style and equipment.\nXu Xin is one of the few penhold grip players in China, especially among the younger generation who are mostly shakehand players. He follows the footsteps of other penhold champions such as Wang Hao and Ma Lin.\nWith his long arms and frame, he is able to more easily reach balls hit wide. His long arms enable a graceful, unique forehand loop, with his arm almost fully outstretched. He has also adopted the reverse penhold backhand grip (RPB), a recent development for China's penholders, allowing a two-winged attack. He still uses a traditional penhold (Chinese) backhand to lob and push the ball with the forehand side of his racket. More recently, Xu Xin has been more willing to counter with his RPB, allowing him to maintain aggression in the points on his backhand side.\nXu Xin's main strength is his shot variation and fast forehand loops, often stepping very deep into his backhand corner to use his forehand. He sets these shots up with his extremely spinny and deceptive serves, and has some of the best footwork in table tennis. He is also something of a 'crowd entertainer’, often coming up with wild, and sometimes inappropriate, shots. He has been dubbed the 'show man' in recent years. This is perhaps due to his playful nature and confidence in playing. He admitted that he hopes to try to be more efficient and effective with his shot selection as he matures and carries more responsibilities. More recently, Xu Xin has been called \"XUperman\", referring to his many \"superman-like\" moments. These names have been widely popularized by Adam Bobrow, an ITTF commentator.\nCareer.\n2013.\nIn January 2013, he reached the No. 1 spot in the World Rankings thanks to the points obtained by winning the ITTF World Tour Grand Finals in December 2012.\n2014.\nIn January 2014, Xu Xin defended his title by beating world No. 1 ranked Ma Long in the finals match of the 2013 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals held in Dubai.\n2016.\nIn 2016, Xu Xin defeated world No. 1 ranked and current World Champion Ma Long 4–2 in the semi-finals match of the 2016 Japan Open, but then was beaten by world No. 2 ranked Fan Zhendong in the finals. One week later after the Japan Open, Xu Xin won his third Korea Open title after beating Ma Long again 4–3 in the finals.\nHowever, he was deemed not good enough to be entered into the singles tournament of the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics.\n2017.\nIn late 2017, he had a disappointing German Open, where in doubles Xu and his partner Fan Zhendong were knocked out in the Round of 16, and lost in the Quarterfinals to Lee Sang-su 4–0 in the singles event. In the Swedish Open, he won the doubles event with Fan Zhendong, before defeating Fan, the world No. 2, 4–1 one hour later in the Men's Singles event. At the 2017 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals, Xu Xin was seeded 5th and lost to 3rd seed Fan Zhendong in the quarter-finals.\n2018.\nXu Xin started his 2018 year by participating with teammates Ma Long, Fan Zhendong, Lin Gaoyuan and Yu Ziyang in the 2018 ITTF Team World Cup, beating Japan in the final. During the tournament, Xu only dropped one set.\nXu Xin entered one of the six platinum events of the tour, the Qatar Open, seeking an unprecedented fourth title. He almost suffered a defeat to Zhou Yu winning 4–3, but he was beaten by Fan Zhendong in the semi-finals 4–1. The following day, Xu Xin along with Fan Zhendong beat Jun Mizutani and Yuya Oshima to claim the men's doubles title. One week later at the German Open, Xu was seeded third but lost to fifth seeded Ma Long in the final. Xu Xin partnered Ma Long to claim his second doubles title of the year defeating Lee Sang-su and Jeong Young-sik in the final.\nThe next month, Xu Xin was a part of the winning team China at the 2018 World Team Table Tennis Championships in his tenth appearance at the World Championships. Xu earned the final point for team China during the final, beating Patrick Franziska 3–1 for China to claim the title with a 3–0 win over Germany.\nAt the China Open, Xu Xin was looking for his first World Tour title of the year. However, his ambitions were stopped in his home country by Lim Jong-hoon in the Round of 32. At the next World Tour platinum event, the Korea Open, Xu Xin was seeded 3rd but lost in the Round of 16 to Jang Woo-jin.\nLooking to redeem himself, Xu Xin claimed the title at the Australian Open beating qualifier Liu Dingshuo in the final, Xu Xin's first World Tour title of the year. Right after that, Xu Xin claimed another title at the Bulgaria Open beating Japan's Kenta Matsudaira in the final. Xu Xin claimed his third men's doubles titles with Ma Long at the Bulgarian Open, their second title as a pair in 2018.\nBecause of his lack of participation in the Asian Cup earlier that year, Xu Xin did not participate in the 2018 ITTF Men's World Cup.\nAt the Swedish Open, Xu Xin was looking to defend his title, but lost to top seed Fan Zhendong in the final. Two days later at the Austrian Open, Xu Xin lost in the final to qualifier Liang Jingkun 4–3 after Liang Jingkun had stunningly beat Fan Zhendong 4–2 in the semi-finals. Xu also claimed his first mixed doubles title ever at the Austrian Open, winning with Liu Shiwen over Cheng-I-Ching and Chen Chien-an in the final.\nDue to Xu's appearance in five finals and claiming two of the titles, Xu Xin was seeded first in the 2018 ITTF World Tour Grand Finals, followed closely by Fan Zhendong, Ma Long, and Liang Jingkun. Xu Xin lost to compatriot Lin Gaoyuan in the quarter-finals, 4–2.\n2019.\nXu Xin started off the year at the 2019 Hungarian Open where he reached the semi-finals. Xu Xin lost to the eventual champion Lin Gaoyuan.\nAt the Qatar Open, Xu Xin faced off against his old rival Ma Long in the semi-final stage. Ma Long had just returned from injury and was making his first appearance on the ITTF World Tour since many months before. In a highly anticipated match, Xu Xin eventually lost to eventual champion Ma Long, where he beat Lin Gaoyuan in the finals.\nHeading in as the number 2 seed at the 2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships, Xu Xin was looking to prove himself during this competition. He participated in the men's singles and mixed doubles with Liu Shiwen. After the draw was made, Xu Xin was the only Chinese player in the bottom half of the draw. Because of the seedings, #1 Fan Zhendong, #3 Lin Gaoyuan, #9 Liang Jingkun, and #11 Ma Long were all drawn in the top half of the draw. Much pressure was placed on Xu to help achieve an all Chinese final, but was also a large opportunity for Xu Xin to perform well at a World Championships. Xu Xin won his first round 4–1 against Jan Zibrat and his second round 4–0 over Austria's Stefan Fegerl. However, Xu's road to the final was stopped by Frenchman Simon Gauzy 4–2. Gauzy outperformed Xu and Gauzy is even said to have \"outspinned the spin master\". Xu's shocking defeat meant that for the first time in over 15 years, there would not be an all Chinese final. The last time this happened was at the 2003 World Championships, where Austria's Werner Schlager faced off against Joo Saehyuk in the men's final. In the mixed doubles event, Xu did not falter, where Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen claimed victory 4–1 over Kasumi Ishikawa and Maharu Yoshimura.\nAt the 2019 Japan Open, Xu Xin became the second person in history to achieve a coveted \"triple crown\", the first being Jang Woojin at the 2018 Korea Open. Xu Xin claimed the champion in singles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles. In the men's singles final, Xu Xin defeated Lin Yun-ju, \"the silent assassin\", in a highly anticipated final. Xu Xin claimed doubles titles with Fan Zhendong and Zhu Yuling.\nXu Xin's performance at the Japan Open was enough to place him again at number one in the world, a position that he last held in early 2015. He replaced Fan Zhendong from the position, who had previously held the spot for over a year. Fan Zhendong dropped to #3 in the world rankings.\nThe following week at the Korea Open, Xu Xin once again claimed the singles title in the final, defeating his good-friend Ma Long in the final. Coming into the final, Xu Xin had lost his six previous encounters against Ma Long on the international stage, and Ma was heavily regarded as the favorite to win. After an amazing match, Xu Xin said that \"Winning the title is not the reason I am feeling so happy. It’s because I beat Ma Long\", paying homage to Ma Long's dominance over the past years. Xu Xin again won the men's doubles title with Fan Zhendong, but in the mixed doubles Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen were defeated by Wong Chun Ting and Doo Hoi Kem at the final stage. This marked the first ever loss for the pairing of Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen, recent mixed doubles world champions at the 2019 ITTF World Table Tennis Championships.\nThe next week at the Australian Open, Xu Xin claimed three men's singles championships in a row on the ITTF World Tour, and became the first person to successfully defend a men's singles title at the Australian Open. Xu Xin beat his colleague Wang Chuqin in the final 4–0; Wang Chuqin had defeated Ma Long at the semi-final stage.\nAfter the Australian Open, the first of the T2 Events were played in Malaysia. In this tournament, Xu Xin showed signs of slowness and tiredness, proposed to be due to the many weeks of play on the world tour. Xu Xin made it to the semi-finals, where he lost to Fan Zhendong 4–0 in a rematch of their semi-final match at the Japan Open earlier this year, where Xu won 4–3.\nMany of the Chinese players have vocalized their dislike of many ITTF events being played one after the other, with no real breaks in between. After the final in Australia, Xu Xin responded \"too tired\". Ma Long and other Chinese players also said the same, but it is said that competitions must be played in order to maintain higher world rankings for the Chinese players, all in preparation for Tokyo 2020.\nAt the 2019 Chinese National Championships, Xu Xin and four of his other prominent colleagues, Ma Long, Fan Zhendong, Liu Shiwen, and Ding Ning all pulled out of the competition. Their reasoning was for them to rest up after they had just played several events back to back on the ITTF World Tour.\nXu Xin ended the year as the World No. 1.\nDue to his outstanding performances and showman-like qualities, Xu Xin gained the nickname of \"XUperman\", holding true to his superhuman play. This nickname is one of Xu Xin's many, the others being the Showman and the Cloudwalker, all descriptive of his playing style.\n2021.\nXu Xin was originally slated to play at WTT Doha in March, but along with the rest of the Chinese national team, he withdrew from all international events until the Tokyo Olympics due to pandemic concerns. Xu played in the China National Qualification event in March and the Chinese Olympic Scrimmage in May, where he lost to several lesser known and lower ranked players.\nIn May, Xu was selected to represent China in the team event of the Tokyo Olympics. Xu reached the finals of the second leg of the Chinese Olympic Scrimmage, where he lost 4–3 to Fan Zhendong despite holding an 8-4 and 3–1 lead.\nIn July, Liu Shiwen and Xu Xin won silver in the mixed doubles event at the Tokyo Olympics being upset 4-3 by Japan's Mima Ito and Jun Mizutani despite initially leading 2–0.\nIn September, Xu reached the quarter-finals at the China National Games. After his round of 16 win over Zhou Yu, Xu noted that he had recently been investing more of himself into his family rather than purely table tennis. Xu lost to Liu Dingshuo in the quarter-finals, but went on to win gold in the mixed doubles event later that day.\n2022.\nOn November 3, the 2022 National Table Tennis Championships began on the first day of competition in Huangshi, Hubei. In the men's team group stage competition, Shanghai, which has Xu Xin, Zhao Zihao, Zhou Kai, and Fan Zhendong, defeated Guangxi 3-0 and got a good start.\nIn the third game, veteran Xu Xin came on the field to face Xie Yunxi. This was also a direct dialogue between the old and new generations of straight-ball players. In the first game, Xu Xin saved two game points after falling behind 8-10 and won 13-11. In the rematch, Xie Yunxi made a few mistakes, and Xu Xin quickly took the lead 6-0. In the end, he won again with 11-3. The third game was like a replica of the second game. In the end, Xu Xin secured a good start in the championship for Shanghai with 11-4.\nCareer statistics.\nITTF Major tournament performance timeline.\nSenior career highlights, as of April 2018:\nSummary of Accomplishments\nPersonal life.\nXu Xin married table tennis player Yao Yan in 2016. They welcomed a son in September 2019.\nAs a child he attended a sports school in Jiangsu province. He sat next to badminton player Wang Shixian during his classes."

        "title": "Field hockey pitch",
        "text": "A hockey pitch is the playing surface for the game of field hockey. Historically, the game was played on natural turf (grass) and nowadays it is predominantly played on an artificial turf. The transition to artificial pitches came during the 1970s and was made mandatory for major competitions in 1976. All the lines, markings and goal specifications are outlined by the International Hockey Federation in \"The Rules of Hockey\".\nAll line markings on the pitch form part of the area which they define. For example, a ball on the side line is still in the field of play; a ball on the line of the penalty circle is in the penalty circle; a foul committed over the 23-metre (25-yard) line has occurred in the 23-metre area. A ball must completely cross a boundary line to be out of play, and a ball must wholly cross the goal line before a goal is scored.\nDue to the original formulation of the rules in England, the standard dimensions of a hockey pitch were originally expressed in imperial units. The rules are now expressed explicitly in metric dimensions (since 1998), although the use of the imperial terms remains common in some countries.\nField of play.\nThe hockey pitch is rectangular in shape. The longer perimeter edges are called the \"side line\", the opposing shorter edges are referred to as the \"back line\" and the portion of this between the goal posts is known as the \"goal line\" The side line must measure 91.40 m (100 yd) and the back line should measure 55.00 m (60 yd). There must be a minimum run-off of at the sidelines and at the backlines, which may be a different surface for the final metre. All line markings must be white and wide. In each corner of the pitch, a corner flag of no more than square is attached to a post of height .\nHistorically, the pitch dimensions were imperial and were replaced by metric equivalents in 1998. The first recorded rules represented what London clubs were using at the time. Surbiton Hockey Club's minutes from 1876 stated that pitches were to be \" long and wide\". Rules by the Hockey Association of England in 1886 specified \"100 yards long by wide\". In 1905, the International Rules Board allowed the width of the pitch to be \"up to \" but this decision was reversed in 1909. In 1975, the current width of 60 yards was written into the rules.\nOn artificial surfaces, the field of play should be coloured green, ultramarine blue or signal blue. It is permitted for the run-off portion of the pitch to be an alternative colour. The London 2012 Olympics started a new trend for blue hockey pitches because blue turf helps television viewers to clearly see the ball and markings on the hockey pitch during gameplay. Not all hockey pitches have to be blue, but a yellow ball on blue turf is now the standard for professional field hockey tournaments.\nGoal.\nGoals consist of two upright posts placed equidistant from the centre of the backline, joined at the top by a horizontal crossbar. The inner edges of the posts must be apart, and the lower edge of the crossbar must be above the ground.\nThe goalposts and crossbar must be white and rectangular in shape with width and a depth of .\nThe goal must be at least 1.20 m deep at ground level and at least 0.90 m deep at crossbar level. The goal area must be delimited at ground level by a goal backboard and two sideboards of height . Affixed to these boards, the posts and crossbar is a net to stop the ball.\nHockey nets can come in different dimensions depending on how deep at ground level and at crossbar level the goal is. Typical dimensions for a standard field hockey net are around 3.7m (W) x 2.1m (H) x 1.2m (D).\nThe first hockey goals were \" tall posts placed apart\" but were reduced to apart in the 1886 rules. In 1987, a rule was introduced so that at penalty corners \"the first hit at goal should not cross the goal-line higher than \". This saw the introduction of a sideboard and backboard to the goals which are now mandatory.\nCircle.\nA goal is scored when the ball passes completely over the goal line but only if the ball was played by an offensive player in the \"penalty circle\". Additionally, the circle marks the area a goalkeeper may play the ball with any part of their body and the area where an infringement by a defender results in a penalty corner. The terminology \"circle\" (or \"D\") is widely used although the area is actually formed by a straight line, parallel to the goal line, connected to two quadrant arcs.\nThe 1876 rules stated that \"no goals shall be allowed if the ball be hit from a distance of more than from the nearest goalpost\". A visible \"striking circle\" with \"radius of 15 yards\" was codified in 1886. The radius of the circle was increased to in 1951 for men's hockey and 1968 for women's hockey. Any free-hit within 5 m of the circle has slightly different rules from others concerning other players’ distance; a broken circle 5 m from the penalty circle denotes this location.\nA \"penalty spot\" is centrally positioned directly in front of the goal and used for a penalty stroke. The spot is 150 mm in diameter and its centre is 6.475 m from the outside of the goal line. Penalty strokes were introduced in 1963 for deliberately stopping a certain goal; they were originally taken from goal. In 1973, a stroke could also be awarded for a deliberate foul in the circle and the spot was moved to from goal the following year.\nOther markings.\nA \"half-way line\", parallel to the back line, divides the pitch in two. The start of each period of play and resumption of play following a goal starts with all players in the half they are defending. The line was also used for the obsolete offside rule.\nEach half of the pitch is then divided again by a line, referred to as the \"23 metre line\" or \"25 yard line\", positioned 22.90 m from each back line. Historically, this was first used to resume play after the ball passed over the back line and marked by flags at the side of the pitch. In 1949, deliberate defensive offenses in this area resulted in a penalty corner. From 1961, players on the defensive team who were not involved at the penalty corner stood behind this line (this was then moved to the half-way line two years later). The line was also used for the offside rule between 1987 until the rule was abolished in 1996. Nowadays, there are detailed rules regarding fouls and free-hits in the 23 metre region of the pitch. Since 2015, the \"23 metre line\" has also been used for the attacking team to resume play when it has gone over the back line (this replaced \"long corners\").\nThere are additional markings 300 mm long and perpendicular to the back line that denote distances of 10 m and 5 m from each goal post. These are relevant at a penalty corner; the former is the mark from which the attacking team takes the penalty corner and the latter is the closest position which a defender may stand. These marks had been in earlier versions of the rules. There is a similar mark 5 m from along the side line (from where \"long corners\" were formerly taken) and a mark 14.6 m along the side line indicating the level of the top of the penalty circle. There are also 150 mm long markings where the goal posts are situated.\nArtificial playing surface.\nHistorically, the game was developed on natural grass turf. However, in 1976, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) made artificial pitches mandatory at all major competitions. The 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal was the first of these; however at this time few players had seen or played on synthetic pitches. Although it is still permissible to play on natural turf all national competitions and international matches must be played on an artificial surface. Elite-level competitions, such as the Olympic Games and World Cup, require a water-based playing surface. However, due to water conservation efforts, this is not seen as a long-term sustainable option and alternative elite surfaces that do not require water are being researched.\nThere are three main types of artificial hockey surface:\nOn water-based pitches, shorter fibres and wetted turf reduce friction and increase the speed at which the game can be played. However, these pitches require watering before, during and after the game and maintenance costs are significant. Sand-dressed pitches cost more than sand-filled pitches but are preferable for hockey as there is an absence of sand close to the playing surface. However, a multi-purpose surface suitable for sports including association football and tennis is often required and hockey may not be the predominant sport. There are many different specifications and categorisations for artificial turf including shock absorption, surface rebound, friction, and strength outlined by the International Hockey Federation. Recently, longer-pile \"third-generation\" or \"3G\" pitches have become popular, especially for football, but these do not usually meet the FIH's test criteria; they are often too inconsistent and slow.\nCriticism.\nThe \"World Hockey\" magazine reported on the first hockey tournament played on an artificial pitch in 1975—a trial event in Montreal prior to the Olympics—and said the surface had \"enormous benefits\". Steve Ruskin, of Sports Illustrated, said that \"A slow, analytical game gave way to one of nonstop, true-hop action.\" However, it has been stated that the decision to make artificial surfaces mandatory greatly favoured more affluent Western countries who could afford these new pitches. Before the switch to an artificial surface the Indian men's hockey team were dominant, winning seven of the eight Olympic gold medals between 1928 and 1964. In 1996, Indian hockey player Ajit Pal Singh stated that despite its size \"[India] can afford only 12 or so AstroTurf fields\". Sardara Singh, captain of the Indian men's hockey team, said that \"hockey players in India play on astroturf for the first time at the age of 19 or 20 and find it hard to adapt.\" It is claimed that the Pakistan hockey team have performed well following the change of surface despite the country being worse off economically and having fewer artificial pitches but the Pakistani team has also not reached the Olympic finals except once in 1984. When describing the change of surface, Ruskin said that \"for India it was like starting over, with all nations even in field hockey.\"\nSee also.\nIndoor hockey pitch, as - in winter, at near freezing temperature - the outdoor hockey fields cannot be used anymore, the outdoor competition is interrupted during these months for a short \"indoor (field) hockey\" season, where multi-purpose fields are used where other typical indoor sport disciplines take place s.a. basketball, handball, indoor soccer, etc."

One of their studies focused on the cardiovascular response to cycling underwater, the study found that pedaling cadence and resistance both have significant impact on the cardiovascular response during underwater cycling. Another of their many studies on the subject focused on how the intensity of these exercises impacted respiratory function. This study found that there is actually no large difference in respiratory function until the workout is one of very high intensity, in which the respiratory muscles must work harder. In a third study they looked into the difference between cycling underwater and cycling on land in terms of respiratory and breathing responses. They found that breathing during underwater cycling is actually shallower, which could result in chronic effects on respiratory function if underwater cycling is executed long term "

Although \"The Eagles Of Carthage\" then held reigning champions West Germany to a 0–0 draw, they failed to advance. Tunisia failed to qualify for the FIFA World Cup again until twenty years later.\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nAdel Sellimi's team were beaten 2–0 by England, and 1–0 by Colombia to eliminate them at the group stage. Their only point was in a 1–1 draw with Romania.\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nTunisia reached their second successive FIFA World Cup (and third overall), which was co-hosted by South Korea and Japan. They started with a 2–0 loss against Russia, but a Raouf Bouzaiene free-kick gave them a 1–1 draw against Belgium in their second match. Their final group game resulted in a 2–0 defeat to co-hosts Japan, meaning they were knocked out in the group stages yet again.\n\"All times local (UTC+9)\"\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nTunisia drew their opening game against Saudi Arabia 2–2, but lost their second match to Spain 3–1 and lost their last group match to Ukraine 1–0, ending their 2006 FIFA World Cup campaign.\n\"All times local (CEST/UTC+2)\"\n2018 FIFA World Cup.\nTunisia vs England.\nThe two teams had met in two matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, an England 2–0 victory.\nEngland scored in the 11th minute when Mouez Hassen stopped a John Stones' header from a corner from the left, but could not save a Harry Kane follow-up from close range. Hassen was substituted four minutes later for Farouk Ben Mustapha due to an injury earlier in the game, after he had a collision with Jesse Lingard. Lingard then mishit a volley from Ashley Young's cross to the far post. After 10 minutes, Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Kane had an appeal for a penalty waved away within five minutes of the restart as he was seemingly impeded by a pair of Tunisia players at a corner. In the additional time, Harry Maguire flicked a Kieran Trippier corner from the right into the path of Kane, who headed it inside the goal after being left free at the back post.\nEngland scored more than once for the first time in 10 World Cup matches, since a 2–2 draw against Sweden in 2006. Kane became the first England player to score a brace in a World Cup match since Gary Lineker against Cameroon in 1990.\n&lt;section begin=g2 /&gt;&lt;section end=g2 /&gt;\nBelgium vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had faced each other in three matches, including one game at the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, which ended in a 1–1 draw.\nJust 6 minutes into the game, Syam Ben Youssef's late challenge on Eden Hazard was deemed, with the use of VAR, to have been just inside the area and he stepped up to score the penalty into the bottom-left corner. Ten minutes later, Dries Mertens won possession just inside the Tunisia half before driving forward and passing the ball to Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku then shot a low strike across Farouk Ben Mustapha into the bottom-right corner. Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from the left was met by Dylan Bronn, who flashed a header past Thibaut Courtois. Thomas Meunier found Lukaku inside the area, which he clipped over the onrushing Mustapha. Toby Alderweireld's long pass from defence was taken on the chest by Hazard, who then rounded Mustapha to stroke into an empty net. Michy Batshuayi met Youri Tielemans' cross at the back post with a controlled half-volley to score Belgium's 5th. Khazri scored deep into stoppage time after a swivel in the box.\nLukaku became the first player since Diego Maradona to score back-to-back braces in consecutive world cup games. Hazard's penalty was Belgium's second quickest goal in a World Cup match (5:59), behind only Léopold Anoul's goal against England in 1954, in the fifth minute. For Tunisia, it has registered as their worst defeat ever in their World Cup history.\n&lt;section begin=g3 /&gt;&lt;section end=g3 /&gt;\nPanama vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had never met before. Both teams had already been eliminated from the tournament before the match.\nPanama took the lead in the 33rd minute, after a José Rodríguez shot from outside the penalty area took a deflection off Yassine Meriah and nestle in the back of the net. In the 51st minute, Naïm Sliti found Wahbi Khazri down the right and the latter's low cross was converted by the Fakhreddine Ben Youssef just six yards out. At the 66 minute mark, Khazri finished off a cross from the left by Oussama Haddadi from close range at the back post.\nTunisia won a World Cup match after 40 years, since their 3–1 victory over Mexico in 1978. Panama became the first nation since Serbia &amp; Montenegro and Togo in 2006 to lose each of their first three World Cup games. Panama's goal means this is the first World Cup tournament in which every side has scored at least two goals in the competition. Meriah's own goal was the 50th in World Cup history.\n&lt;section begin=g6 /&gt;&lt;section end=g6 /&gt;\n2022 FIFA World Cup.\nDenmark vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in 2002, a 2–1 win for Denmark in a friendly game.\nDenmark were not able to capitalize in their opening game; although Tunisia failed to score a single goal themselves, they still managed to secure their match without problems, with Aïssa Laïdouni earning the Man of the Match.\n&lt;section begin=D1 /&gt;&lt;section end=D1 /&gt;\nTunisia vs Australia.\nThe two teams have faced each other twice, most recently in Tunisia's 2–0 win at the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nAustralia beat Tunisia 1–0 to secure their first win in a World Cup match since 2010 when they defeated Serbia 2–1. Mitchell Duke became the first player in the history to score in the FIFA World Cup while playing for a second-tier division club, as he represented Fagiano Okayama in the J2 League when the World Cup started.\n&lt;section begin=D3 /&gt;&lt;section end=D3 /&gt;\nTunisia vs France.\nThe two teams had faced each other four times, most recently in a 2010 friendly, a 1–1 draw.\nDespite being eliminated due to Australia's win against Denmark, Tunisia's victory against France marked the first time the nation had ever beaten the current title holders at the World Cup.\nFrench-born Wahbi Khazri scored the only goal of the game as Tunisia upset World Cup holders France 1-0 at the Education City Stadium on Wednesday, 30 November 2022.\n&lt;section begin=D6 /&gt;&lt;section end=D6 /&gt;"

        "text": "Ben Hutton (born April 20, 1993) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman for the Vegas Golden Knights of the National Hockey League (NHL). Hutton was drafted 147th overall by the Vancouver Canucks in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\nHutton played Junior A with the Kemptville 73's and Nepean Raiders of the Central Canada Hockey League before joining the college hockey ranks with the Maine Black Bears of the Hockey East league. Hutton earned All-Hockey East First Team honours during his college career. Internationally, he represented Canada at the 2011 World Junior A Challenge, winning silver, and played for Canada at the 2016 IIHF World Championship in Moscow, winning gold. Hutton won the Stanley Cup with the Golden Knights in 2023.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nHutton played for the Maine Black Bears in the NCAA Men's Division I Hockey East conference. In his second year, Hutton's outstanding play was rewarded with a selection to the 2013–14 All-Hockey East first team.\nProfessional.\nVancouver Canucks (2015–2019).\nHutton was drafted 147th overall by the Vancouver Canucks of the National Hockey League (NHL) in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Following his junior season with the Black Bears, on March 16, 2015, Hutton was signed to a two-year, entry-level contract with the Canucks. He was then assigned to their American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Utica Comets, to finish the 2014–15 season. On October 5, Hutton was named to the Canucks' roster to start the 2015–16 NHL season, despite having been expected to begin the year with Utica. He made his NHL debut on October 7, earning his first career point, an assist, setting up Jannik Hansen for the game's opening goal in an eventual 5–1 win against the Calgary Flames. He scored his first NHL goal on January 17, 2016, against goaltender Jaroslav Halák in a game against the New York Islanders, which the Canucks won 2–1 in a shootout. Hutton finished his rookie season with one goal and 24 assists for 25 points in 75 games played, and was named the team's most outstanding defenceman, recognized by the Babe Pratt Trophy.\nOn November 24, 2016, Hutton signed a two-year, $5.6 million contract extension with the Canucks. On December 3, Hutton appeared in his 100th NHL game, playing against the Toronto Maple Leafs. During the 2017–18 NHL season, Hutton fell out of favour with coach Travis Green, scratching the defenceman and in the following off-season, the Canucks attempted to deal Hutton without success. In his final season with the Canucks, Hutton had 20 points in 69 games and was second on the team in average ice time, averaging 22:21 minutes per game.\nLos Angeles Kings (2019–2020).\nAfter not being tendered a contract by Vancouver during the 2019 off-season, Hutton became an unrestricted free agent. On September 17, 2019, he signed a one-year, $1.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. In 65 games with the Kings during the 2019–20 NHL season, Hutton had 16 points.\nAnaheim Ducks (2021).\nAs a free agent entering the pandemic-delayed 2020–21 season, Hutton belatedly joined the Anaheim Ducks training camp on professional tryout basis. On January 15, 2021, the Ducks signed Hutton to a one-year, $950,000 contract for the remainder of the season. He skated in 34 regular season games with the Ducks, collecting one goal and five points.\nToronto Maple Leafs (2021).\nWith the Ducks well out of playoff contention, Hutton was dealt at the trade deadline to add blueline depth to the Toronto Maple Leafs, in exchange for a fifth-round draft pick in 2022 on April 12, 2021. He played in his first game with the Maple Leafs in a 4–1 victory over the Vancouver Canucks. Hutton would play in four regular season games with Toronto, but was a healthy scratch for the team during the postseason. At the end of the season, Hutton was not offered a contract by the Maple Leafs.\nVegas Golden Knights (2021–present).\nDuring training camp in the off-season, Hutton received another professional tryout with the Anaheim Ducks but failed to make the roster. With the 2021–22 season already started, Hutton remained unsigned as a free agent. With the Vegas Golden Knights depleted through injury, Hutton was signed to a one-year, $750,000 contract with Vegas on October 28, 2021. On March 4, 2022, Hutton registered his 100th career point in a 5–4 win over the Ducks. Hutton then signed a two-year, $1.7 million contract extension on March 5, 2022.\nIn his second season with the Golden Knights, Hutton was in and out of the lineup. He finished the season with 31 games played, scoring three goals and eight points in limited time. Hutton made his playoff debut in Game 5 of the first round in the 2023 Stanley Cup playoffs versus the Winnipeg Jets. The Golden Knights won the game 4–1, eliminating the Jets. He appeared in the second round versus the Edmonton Oilers also playing the game that eliminated the Oilers, but did not play in the Western Conference Finals versus the Dallas Stars or the 2023 Stanley Cup Finals versus the Florida Panthers. Hutton and the Golden Knights won the Stanley Cup, beating the Panthers in five games in the finals. On December 22, 2023, Hutton signed a two-year, $1.95 million contract extension with Vegas.\nInternational play.\nHutton represented Canada East at the 2011 World Junior A Challenge in Langley, British Columbia. He scored a goal and two assists in four games as Canada East won silver, losing to Canada West in the gold medal game.\nHutton represented Canada national team at the 2016 IIHF World Championship, alongside Vancouver Canucks teammate Christopher Tanev. Hutton won a gold medal in the tournament as Canada defeated Finland 2–0 in the final."

        "title": "Wales at the 2014 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "Wales competed at the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow, Scotland. Prior to the games the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales set itself a target of 27 medals, surpassing the 2010 total of 20 medals won in Delhi. After the withdrawal of World champion competitors Helen Jenkins, Non Stanford and Becky James, Chef de Mission Brian Davies conceded that the initial target was optimistic, but the target was actually attained by 30 July, the sixth day of the competition. Wales finished 13th in the overall medal table (ranked in order of the number of \"gold\" medals won), but joint 8th, with Nigeria, in terms of the total medals won.\nWales finished with 36 medals, making the team the most successful Welsh squad in Commonwealth Games history. The country secured five gold medals, won by Francesca Jones (gymnastics), Geraint Thomas (cycling), Natalie Powell (judo), Jazz Carlin and Georgia Davies (swimming). Francesca Jones was the most successful member of the Welsh squad securing six medals, with five silvers to add to her gold. Other multiple medal athletes includes fellow gymnasts Laura Halford and Georgina Hockenhull, swimmer Jazz Carlin and cyclist Geraint Thomas. Gymnastics was the country's most successful sport winning ten medals, but podium finishes were achieved across ten of the 18 sports contested. Wales medal total also included four from para-sport events.\nDuring the closing ceremony Francesca Jones was awarded the David Dixon Award as the outstanding athlete of the Games, reflecting not only her performance as a competitor but also as a role model to her sport and as an ambassador of fair play.\nAdministration.\nThe national body created to select the Wales team at the 2014 Commonwealth Games was the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales (CGCW) ().\nThe CGCW Board is managed by its Council which is made up of members from all sports that can attend a Commonwealth Games. The chair of the board to see Team Wales through the Games is Helen Phillips, who is also the Chair of Wales Gymnastics. The Company Secretary is Sue Holvey while its directors are Deborah Godbold, Nicola Phillips and Ron Davies. The President of CGCW is Anne Ellis while the CEO is Chris Jenkins, the only full-time employed member of the board.\nThe chef de mission for Team Wales is Brian Davies, the first time he has held the position after serving on the team in the previous two competitions. Paralympic world record holding athlete Aled Davies was confirmed as team captain at the official team send-off at the Swalec Stadium in Cardiff on 23 June 2014.\nBuild up to the Games.\nHigh Standards were set in the run up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games for the Wales team, with a target of 27 medals set by the Commonwealth Games Council for Wales. This surpassed the team's total achieved at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. The first major set back for the team was the withdrawal in June of world triathlete champion Non Stanford, who was unable to recover in time from a stress fracture to her ankle. Two weeks later it was announced that double cycling world champion Becky James would also be withdrawing from the Games, also due to an injury. A week before the Games began triathlete Helen Jenkins, another medal hopeful, was forced to leave the Welsh team, again through injury. Other team members forced to withdraw through injury close to the opening of the Games included weightlifter Faye Pittman and judoka Kyle Davies.\nAs well as the athletes who left the squad through injury, several hopefuls' withdrawals were more controversial. On 16 July it was announced that 800m runner Gareth Warburton had been charged with anti-doping rule violations and was unable to be selected, this was followed on the opening day of the Games with the withdrawal of 400m hurdler and team Wales vice captain Rhys Williams again after failing a drug test at a Grand Prix event earlier that month.\nFurther disappointment for Welsh medal hopes came from the boxing team. Olympic silver medalist Fred Evans was unable to compete after long negotiations between the Welsh camp and the Home Office and Games officials resulting in a refusal of accreditation. Earlier in the year Evans had admitted his part in a nightclub assault. A second loss from the boxing team was female fighter Ashley Brace, who was disqualified from taking part in the Games as she was adjudged to have once been a professional kick-boxer and was thus not an amateur fighter.\nThe loss of so many world class athletes led Chef de Mission Brian Davies to conceded that the initial target of 27 medals was now optimistic."

        "title": "EPCR Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The EPCR Challenge Cup is an annual rugby union competition organised by European Professional Club Rugby (EPCR). It is the second-tier competition for clubs based in European leagues behind the European Rugby Champions Cup. From its inception in 1996 to 2014, it was known as the European Challenge Cup and governed by European Rugby Cup (ERC). Following disagreements in the structure of the tournament's format and division of revenue, the English and French leagues withdrew to form the EPCR, which organized the Challenge Cup and the Champions Cup since the 2014–15 season.\nThe Challenge Cup is currently contested between 18 teams; 16 of which qualify from the three main European domestic leagues (Premiership Rugby, Top 14, and United Rugby Championship). \nIn 2023–24, two teams outside of the western Europe leagues had been invited to participate in the tournament. The Cheetahs, a South African team who won the 2023 Currie Cup will play in the cup, using Amsterdam as their home base. Also, for the 2023-24 season, Georgia's Black Lion team will play in the cup, as holders of the third-tier Rugby Europe Super Cup. Many more teams had applied to play in the 2024 season of the .\nFormat.\nQualification.\n18 teams qualify for the EPCR Challenge Cup in 2023–24.\n16 of these teams automatically qualified from the English Premiership Rugby, the French Top 14 and the United Rugby Championship, the 17th and 18th teams are invited to participate.\nContinental Shield.\nUntil 2019–20 the 19th and 20th teams qualified via a Qualifying Competition, organised by European Professional Club Rugby and Rugby Europe.\nFor the 2014–15 season, this took the form of 2 two-legged play-off matches, with the aggregate winner of each taking one of the two Rugby Europe spots in the draw, and it involved the 2 best teams from Italy's Top12, plus a Romanian and Georgian selections.\nAn expanded format, which was expected to feature more matches and more nations, for qualification into the 2015–16 European Rugby Challenge Cup, and subsequent seasons, was expected to be announced 15 September 2014. However, on 5 September 2014, it was announced that no such competition would take place during the 2014–15 season, and negotiations continue to create the new competition as soon as possible.\nSubsequently, on 22 December 2014, EPCR announced negotiations for a new format for the competition had now been completed, and the Qualifying Competition for entry into the 2015–16 Challenge Cup would begin in January.\nThe expanded format includes clubs from Rugby Europe member unions Russia, Spain and Portugal alongside representatives from the Italian Eccellenza, and is being jointly organised by EPCR, Rugby Europe, and the Federazione Italiana Rugby (FIR).\nThe teams in the competition are split into two pools. Each team participates in a pool stage, before the two pool winners compete in a two-legged play-off against the teams currently competing in the Challenge Cup from the previous season.\nThe winners, on aggregate, of these two play-offs will take up the two final places in the Challenge Cup.\nIn 2017, the competition was rebranded as the European Rugby Continental Shield, and introduced a final to be held as part of the main finals weekend and contested by the two play-off winners.\nCompetition.\nGroup stage.\nFor the pool stage there are two pools of ten teams. The teams are ranked based on domestic league performance the previous season, and arranged into three tiers. Teams are then drawn from the tiers into pools at random.\nTeams will play two other teams in their pool twice, both at home and away and match points will be awarded depending on the result of each game. Teams receive four points for a win, and two for a draw. Teams can also earn 1 try bonus point for scoring four or more tries, and 1 losing bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nFollowing the completion of the pool stage, the top six teams in each pool will qualify for the knock-out stage. They are joined in the round of 16 by the teams placed 9th and 10th in each Champions Cup pool.\nKnock-out stage.\nThe eight quarter-finalists are ranked – pool winners from 1 to 5, and runners-up from 6 to 8 – based on performance in their respective pool. The four pool winners with the best pool record receive home advantage for the quarter-finals against one of the four lower-ranked teams, in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6, 4v5 format. Unlike the later formats of the old European Challenge Cup, no teams will drop down into the competition from the Champions Cup.\nThe winners of the quarter-finals will contest the two semi-finals, the semi-final matches will be determined by criteria, and the winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, which is usually held in May.\nTemporary changes to format.\nBecause of the Coronavirus Pandemic the 2020/2021 competition took on a revised format.\n2020–21 European Rugby Challenge Cup\nA similar format remained for the 2021/22 season, however, the number of teams was increased from 14 to 15 and an additional six will join from the Champions Cup.\n2021–22 European Rugby Challenge Cup\nThe format revision was removed from the 2022/23 season, so with the introduction of South African sides to the EPCR, 16 teams now qualify based on domestic league performance, with two further team invited. For the \n2023–24 EPCR Challenge Cup season, the invited teams will be the South African team, Cheetahs, and Black Lion from Georgia.\nFinals.\nThe competition has been dominated by English and French clubs since it was first introduced in 1996, reflecting the historical depth of those two leagues. However, teams from Ireland, Wales and Scotland have all made the final of the Challenge Cup, with the trophy twice being won by Cardiff Rugby from Wales, and once by the Irish provincial side Leinster.\nHistory.\nEuropean Challenge Cup.\n1996–1999.\nEuropean rugby competition began with the launch of the Heineken Cup in the summer of 1995.\nThe Challenge Cup began as the 'European Conference' (later renamed the European Shield) in 1996 with 24 teams from England, France, Italy, Romania, Scotland and Wales divided into four groups of six. All seven of the French teams made it to the quarter-finals with English club Northampton Saints filling the other berth. Predictably, the final was an all-French affair with Bourgoin beating Castres Olympique 18–9 to win the shield.\nThe following year's competition had an increased entry with eight groups of four teams. Colomiers continued the French dominance of the European Shield, defeating Agen 43–5 in the final.\nThe absence of English and Scottish clubs in 1998–99 saw the competition reduced to 21 teams divided into three groups of seven teams with representative sides of Spain and Portugal taking part. Once again, a French team was triumphant, with Montferrand beating Bourgoin 35–16 in the final held in Lyon.\nWith English and Scottish clubs back in the competition in 1999, there were 28 teams split in seven groups of four and London Irish and Bristol reached the semi-finals of the competition, but couldn't prevent another all-French final with Section Paloise crowned champions after a 34–21 defeat of Castres.\n2000–2006.\nThe competition structure remained unchanged for the 2000–01 season, although no team from Romania participated. The semi-final draw was an all-English and all-French affair to leave Harlequins and Narbonne contesting the first final on English soil. Harlequins ended French dominance of the European Shield, defeating RC Narbonne 27–26 after extra time in the final.\nThere was a new sponsor and a name change in 2001. The new \"Parker Pen Shield\" saw 32 teams divided into eight groups of four competing for the title. For the first time there were two Spanish club teams (Valladolid RAC and UC Madrid) and Romania was represented. Only one French club reached the quarter-finals along with five English and two from Wales and for the first time no French club reached the semi-finals after Pau lost to London Irish. For the first time, a Welsh team, Pontypridd, made it to the final but Sale Sharks emerged victorious, coming from behind to win 25–22 at the Kassam Stadium in Oxford.\nThe league format was abandoned in 2002 and the tournament became a knock-out competition. This involved 32 clubs from eight nations, half of them seeded and drawn against an un-seeded team on a home and away basis. The name \"Parker Pen Shield\" was now applied to a reprechage knock-out tournament for those teams that did not qualify for the second round of the Challenge Cup. The Parker Pen Challenge Cup winner now automatically qualified for the Heineken Cup. London Wasps beat Bath 48–30 to win the renamed \"Parker Pen Challenge Cup\" at the Madejski Stadium, Reading.\nIn 2003–04, the Welsh Rugby Union voted to create regions to play in the Celtic League and represent Wales in European competition. Henceforce Wales entered regional sides rather than the club sides which had previously competed. With a reduction from nine professional clubs to just five, there was no Welsh entry in that year's competition. Romania also did not take part in the Challenge Cup. Harlequins won the cup with a 27–26 last-second victory over Montferrand at the Madejski Stadium to become the first side to win the tournament twice.\nSale eased to victory in the 2005 final 27–3 over a disappointing Pau side. In 2006, Gloucester edged out London Irish 36–34 after extra time.\nThe Parker Pen Shield was abandoned in 2005 due to restructuring of the European Challenge Cup. The competition reverted to being a league format followed by knock-out phase with five pools of four teams and home and away matches. Romanian interest returned to the competition in the form of București Rugby who had been formed to represent Romania in European competition, however, there was no representation from Spain or Portugal.\n2006–2009.\nClermont were the first French winners of the title for seven years after they beat Bath in the 2006–07 competition; Clermont also reached the Top 14 final this year after finishing poorly the previous couple of years.\nBeaten 2007 finalists Bath won the 2007–08 tournament after beating fellow English club Worcester Warriors in the final in Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester. Spanish representation resumed in the 2007–08 Challenge Cup when Spanish Champions CR El Salvador took part.\nNorthampton Saints won the 2009 final after beating Bourgoin 15–3 at the Twickenham Stoop; that season Northampton avoided relegation, they finished 2nd in the regular season of the Guinness Premiership, reached the Heineken Cup quarter-finals and won the Anglo-Welsh Cup the next season. Northampton became the eighth English club to win the competition in 9 seasons.\n2010–2014.\nThe competition organiser, European Rugby Cup, announced several changes to the Challenge Cup effective in 2009–10:\nCardiff Blues benefited from the new format in its first year, winning the first ever Challenge Cup for the club and were also the first Welsh Club to win any European club tournament. Cardiff beat Toulon 28–21 in the final at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, which was also the first final to have no English involvement for 10 years.\nEngland made a triumphant return to the final in 2011, with Harlequins defeating Stade Français 19–18. with a try in the last five-minutes by Argentinian wing, Gonzalo Camacho. This meant Harlequins became the first team to win the Challenge Cup three times and with this entered the Heineken Cup. The final was also notable in that it involved two teams that began the season in the Challenge Cup.\nThe 2011–12 competition was dominated by French sides, with all four semi-finalists coming from that country. Biarritz, which had parachuted in from the Heineken Cup, defeated Toulon to claim their first Challenge Cup.\nThe 2012–13 season again saw the Challenge Cup claimed by a team that parachuted in from the Heineken Cup. This time, the victor was Leinster, which became the first team from Ireland to win the Challenge Cup.\nNorthampton Saints won the last edition of the European Challenge Cup in 2014, beating Bath 30–16 in the final.\nEuropean Rugby Challenge Cup.\n2014–2021.\nOn 10 April 2014, following almost two years of negotiations, a statement was released under the aegis of European Professional Club Rugby announcing that the nine stakeholders to the new competition, the six unions and three umbrella club organisations (Premiership Rugby, Ligue Nationale de Rugby and Regional Rugby Wales), had signed Heads of Agreement for the formation of the European Rugby Champions Cup, the European Rugby Challenge Cup and a new, third tournament, called the Qualifying Competition. On the same day, BT and Sky signed an agreement that divided coverage of the new European competitions. Both would split the pool matches, quarter-finals, and semi-finals equally, and both would broadcast the final. BT would receive first choice of English Premiership club matches in the Champions Cup, with Sky receiving the same privilege for the Challenge Cup. Subsequently, BT have signed an exclusive deal for the Challenge Cup between 2018–19 and 2021–22.\nSponsorship &amp; suppliers.\nSponsors.\nFollowing the introduction of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, organisers decided to introduce a Champions League-style sponsorship system, including 3–5 principal partners, in lieu of one title sponsor.\nMedia coverage.\nEuropean markets:\nOther markets:\nFor Australia, Europe (unsold markets), and Southeast Asia, all matches of the EPCR package (both Champions and Challenge Cups) available on Rugby Pass.\nSome games are also livestreamed for free on EPCR TV."

        "text": "The 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup was the first season of the European Rugby Challenge Cup, the annual rugby union competition. It is the 19th season of second tier pan-European club competition in general, as the competition replaces the European Challenge Cup. The competition began with the first round of the group stage, on the weekend of 16 October 2014, and ended with the final on 1 May 2015 at the Twickenham Stoop.\nGloucester became the first ever champions of the newly formatted competition, beating Edinburgh, who became the first ever Scottish team to make a European final, 19–13, with 14 men on the pitch for the final 17 minutes after centre Bill Meakes was sent off because of a dangerous high tackle off the ball on Edinburgh centre Sam Beard.\nTeams.\nTwenty teams qualified for the 2014–15 European Rugby Challenge Cup, based on their performance in their respective domestic leagues the previous season. The distribution of teams is as follows:\nSo far, the following 18 teams have qualified.\nChampions Cup play-off.\nThe following teams took part in the play-off to decide the final team in the Champions Cup. The play-off was held between the seventh-placed teams in the English Premiership and the Top 14. The loser of this play-off entered the Challenge Cup.\nOn 29 April 2014, it was announced that this play-off would take place over two legs, on the weekends of 17/18 May and 24/25 May, with a draw being used to determine home advantage for each leg.\nThe draw took place in Heathrow on 6 May 2014. Following the draw, the fixtures were announced as follows:\nStade Français lost the play-off 35-50 on aggregate, and will play in the Challenge Cup.\nQualifying Competition.\nOn 14 August 2014, EPCR announced the format for the first Qualifying Competition.\nGiven the amount of time until the start of the Challenge Cup, it was announced that this first competition will consist of two ties, played over two legs, with the aggregate winner of each taking a place in either pool. The first legs took place on 20 September, with the return legs taking place on 27 September\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams will be seeded and split into four tiers, seeding will be based on performance in their respective domestic leagues. Where promotion and relegation is in effect in a league, the promoted team will be seeded last, or (if multiple teams are promoted) by performance in the lower tier. So, Lyon – who were Pro D2 champions – will be the seventh Top 14 seed while La Rochelle – who qualified through the Pro D2 play-off – will be the eighth seed.\nAs with the previous European competition, the European Challenge Cup, teams from the same country will be kept apart where possible. However, as 8 teams have qualified from France, 3 pools will contain two French teams – Oyonnax, Lyon and La Rochelle.\nFor the purposes of creating the tiers, the clubs are ranked based on their finishing positions in the Top 14, Aviva Premiership, Pro12 and PRO D2 Leagues, or on their qualification via a play-off.\nTeams will be taken from a league in order of rank and put into a tier. A draw is used allocate two second seeds to Tier 1, the remaining team will go into Tier 2. This allocation then determines which fourth seeded team enters Tier 2, while the others enter Tier 3.\nGiven the nature of the Qualifying Competition, a competition including developing rugby nations and Italian clubs not competing in the Pro12, Rugby Europe 1 and Rugby Europe 2 are automatically included in Tier 4, despite officially being ranked 1/2 from \"that competition\".\nThe brackets show each teams seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team has been seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 10 June 2014, at the Stade de la Maladière in Neuchâtel.\nTeams will play each other twice, both at home and away, in the group stage, that will begin on the weekend of 16/17/18/19 October 2014, and continue through to 22/23/24/25 January 2015, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progress to the quarter-finals.\nFixtures were announced on Thursday 14 August 2014 at 2 pm.\nTeams are awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers are used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nThe eight qualifiers will be seeded according to performance in the pool stage, and compete in the quarter-finals, which will be held on the 3/4/5 April 2015. The four top seeds will host the quarter-finals against the lower seeds, in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals, to be contested by the quarter-final winners, will take place on the weekend of 17/18/19 April 2015.\nThe winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, at The Twickenham Stoop, on the weekend of 1 May 2015."

        "text": "John Clyde Grass (born February 29, 1968) is an American football coach. He is the former head football coach at the Jacksonville State University, a position he held from 2014 until 2021. Grass joined the coaching staff of the Jacksonville State Gamecocks in 2013 as assistant head coach and offensive coordinator under Bill Clark. He previously coached high school football in the state of Alabama for over two decades.\nGrass was born in Ashville, Alabama. Since he was born on February 29 (commonly known as a \"leap year baby\"), his date of birth is recognized as February 28.\nCoaching career.\nGrass was named head coach of the Jacksonville State Gamecocks in 2014 after Bill Clark left to fill a coaching vacancy at UAB. During the 2014 regular season, the Gamecocks went 10–1 and received the No. 3 seed in NCAA Division I Football Championship playoffs. They won the Ohio Valley Conference outright for the first time.\nDuring the 2015 season, the Gamecocks again won the OVC Championship outright. They narrowly lost to Auburn in an overtime game, and went on to play North Dakota St. Bison in the FCS National Championship game, where they lost 37–10. JSU's record finished at 13–2.\nThe 2016 season was also a successful season for Jacksonville State, where they again won the OVC Championship outright, and were granted the No. 3 seed for the FCS playoffs. Grass' third season as head coach finished during the second round of the FCS Playoffs, where they were upset by the Youngstown St. Penguins 40–24 at home.\nGrass resigned as head coach at Jacksonville State on November 8, 2021 with two regular season games left to play. No reason was given, but it was a mutual decision by Grass and the administration. The following month, it was announced that Grass was hired by Clemson in an off-field analyst role. \nEducation and family.\nGrass graduated from Jacksonville State in 1990 with a bachelor's degree in physical education. He received a master's of physical education from Jacksonville State in 1997 and an Ed.S. in administration in 2010 from Lincoln Memorial University.\nGrass married his wife, Jada (née Arnold) in 1995. They have three children: Judd, Jules, and Jayce Cannon."

        "text": "The 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the final game of the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 2013–14 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 7, 2014, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, between the East Regional Champions, seventh-seeded Connecticut, and the Midwest Regional Champions, eighth-seeded Kentucky.\nConnecticut got out to a quick start, leading by 15 points in the first half. Kentucky fought back, narrowing the gap to 35–31 at halftime. In the second half, Kentucky got within one point on several occasions, but never took the lead. Connecticut pulled away in the final minute, winning the game, 60–54.\nOverview.\nThe 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship Game was played on April 7, 2014, at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. It featured the East Regional Champions, seventh-seeded Connecticut (UConn) against the Midwest Regional Champions, eighth-seeded Kentucky. Although Connecticut won the 2011 championship, and Kentucky the 2012 edition, neither team made the 2013 tournament. It was the first championship game since 1966 in which neither finalist was in the previous year's tournament (in 2013, Kentucky participated in the NIT, losing in the first round, while UConn was ineligible for 2013 postseason tournament play due to sanctions imposed on the program for previous years' APR violations). These two teams also met in the Final Four during Connecticut's previous national championship run in 2011, with the Huskies winning 56-55 before beating Butler in the final.\nThe 2014 national championship game featured the highest combined seeds in NCAA history, surpassing 2011's number 8 vs. number 3 match-up. It was the first ever to not feature a number 1, a number 2, or a number 3 seed. It is the third national championship game not to feature a number 1 or a number 2 seed, with the other two being the 1989 national championship game between number 3 Michigan and number 3 Seton Hall, in which Michigan won, 80–79, in overtime, and the 2011 national championship game between number 3 Connecticut and Butler in which Connecticut won, 53–41.\nKentucky was considered the pre-game favorite. The referees for the game were Joe DeRosa, Verne Harris, and Doug Shows; the alternate was Mike Roberts.\nParticipants.\nKentucky Wildcats.\nWith seven McDonald's All-Americans on their roster, the Kentucky Wildcats were ranked first in the preseason AP poll. In non-conference play, they went 10–3, losing to Michigan State, Baylor, and North Carolina. In Southeastern Conference (SEC) play, they went 12–6 and fell out of the AP top 25. They lost the finals of the SEC tournament to Florida.\nKentucky entered the 2014 NCAA tournament as an at-large selection, and were given the number 8 seed in the Midwest Region. They opened the 2014 NCAA Tournament with a 56–49 victory over Kansas State. In the next round of the NCAA Tournament, Kentucky handed Wichita State their only loss of the season, beating them 78–76. In the Sweet 16, they knocked off their in-state rival and defending (vacated) national champion, Louisville, 74–69 to advance to the Elite 8. In the Elite Eight, Aaron Harrison made a three-pointer with the score tied at 72–72 with 2.3 seconds left to beat Michigan and advance to the 2014 Final Four after Nik Stauskas missed a half-court shot which would have sent the game to overtime. In the Final Four, Kentucky faced Wisconsin. With the game tied 71–71 with 16 seconds left, Andrew Harrison fouled Traevon Jackson in the act of shooting. Jackson made two out of three free throws to take a 73–71 lead. With 5.7 seconds left, Aaron Harrison made a three-pointer that put Kentucky up 74–73. Jackson missed a last-second shot and Kentucky advanced to the national championship game.\nKentucky was the third number 8 seed to participate in the national championship game. In 1985, Villanova beat number 1 Georgetown 66–64 in the national championship game. In 2011, Butler lost to number 3 Connecticut 53–41 in the national championship game. The Wildcats were the ninth team to appear in the title game despite being unranked in the final AP poll since the poll began in 1948.\nConnecticut Huskies.\nThe Connecticut Huskies were ranked number 18 in the preseason AP poll and did not have any McDonald's All-American selections on their roster. They started 9–0, rising to #10, but quickly dropped out of the top 25 when they got off to a slow start in the American Athletic Conference (AAC). They ended up 12–6 in conference play and lost to Louisville—who had defeated UConn by 33 points in the final regular season game for both teams—in the AAC tournament finals 71-61.\nConnecticut entered the 2014 NCAA Tournament as an at-large selection and was given the number 7 seed in the East Region. In the second round of the tournament, Connecticut pulled away from St. Joseph's, beating them 89–81 in overtime. In the third round, Shabazz Napier scored 25 points to beat Villanova 77–65. In the Sweet 16, DeAndre Daniels scored 27 points leading UConn to an 81–76 win over Iowa State to advance to the East Regional Finals. In the Elite Eight, Napier's 25 points were enough to outlast Gary Harris's 22 points and beat Michigan State 60–54 to advance to the Final Four. In the Final Four, Connecticut faced Florida, whom they had beaten 65–64 on December 2, 2013, at Gampel Pavilion on a Napier buzzer-beating shot. Florida jumped out to an early 16–4 lead in the rematch, but UConn turned things around and upset number 1 Florida, 63–53, ending Florida's 30-game winning streak. DeAndre Daniels had 20 points and 10 rebounds, becoming only the fourth player to do so in a national semifinal win in the last 25 years. (Carmelo Anthony of Syracuse had 33 points and 10 rebounds in a 95–84 victory over Texas in the 2003 Final Four. Corliss Williamson did it twice for Arkansas, once in 1994 in a 91–82 win over Arizona, and once in 1995 with 21 points and 10 rebounds in a 75–68 win over North Carolina. Chris Webber of Michigan achieved the feat in 1993 in an 81–78 win over Kentucky.)\nConnecticut was the first number 7 seed to reach the national title game. Their 33-point loss to Louisville at end of the regular season is the largest defeat ever suffered by an eventual National Champion.\nGame summary.\nConnecticut scored first, and got out to a quick start, in what \"USA Today\" described as \"a physical, ugly game\". Ryan Boatright and Shabazz Napier combined to score 12 points for an early 19–10 lead. Napier scored five more points as Connecticut jumped out to a 30–15 lead with six minutes to go in the half. Kentucky's James Young made a three pointer and then, Aaron Harrison followed up with the steal-and-dunk to cut the Connecticut lead to 30–20. The Wildcats switched to a zone on defense, which slowed down Connecticut's offensive attacks. Young and Harrison each made a three-pointer to cut the Connecticut lead to 33–26. Kentucky continued the comeback as Julius Randle and Marcus Lee each made baskets in the last minute of the first half to cut the Connecticut lead to 35–31 at the half.\nConnecticut got off to a slow start in the second half, hitting just one of its first ten shots. In the early minutes, Kentucky cut the lead to one several times, but failed to take the lead. Connecticut built their lead to 48–39 with under 11 minutes to go. Then, with 10:40 to play, Young dribbled through three defenders and dunked the ball while being fouled in what was described as the best play of the game. The Wildcats scored the next six, again cutting the lead to one point. During that stretch Boatright turned his ankle on a routine pass but remained in the game. After Aaron Harrison missed an open three with 8:13 left, After a few possessions during which neither team scored, Napier hit a three-pointer at the 6:50 mark that appeared to end Kentucky's momentum. On Kentucky's subsequent possession Julius Randle drove to the basket for a layup to cut the lead back to two, and on the next play Huskies forward Niels Giffey responded with another three-point shot to put the Huskies back up by 5. At the 2:45 mark, DeAndre Daniels hit a short shot to put the Huskies up 58–52. With just under a minute to go and Kentucky down four, they elected not to foul. Near the end of the shot clock, Napier located an open Lasan Kromah who was then fouled as he attempted a short shot. After Kromah, who had the lowest free throw percentage of the Huskies on the court at 67% for the season, made both free throws, Aaron Harrison missed a three pointer and Connecticut dribbled out the clock for a 60–54 win. After the game, Kentucky coach John Calipari remarked, \"We had our chances to win. We're missing shots, we're missing free throws.\"\nThe Huskies were only tied at 2-2 and 6-6 at the beginning of the game and never trailed en route to their fourth National Title. The school is now 4–0 in national championship games. The American Athletic Conference, in its first year of existence, claimed its first title. Connecticut became the lowest seed to win the tournament since Villanova beat Georgetown in 1985 as an 8 seed. Coach Kevin Ollie became the first coach to win the championship in his first tournament appearance since Steve Fisher did it in 1989. The second-year coach credited longtime UConn coach Jim Calhoun for the victory saying \"Coach Calhoun, the greatest coach ever. He paved the way we just walked through it.\" Giffey, Napier, and Tyler Olander, who had been on UConn's 2011 championship team, became the first players in NCAA Division I men's basketball history to win national titles as freshmen and seniors.\nNapier led Connecticut with 22 points, on 8 of 16 shooting, and 6 rebounds. He also had three assists. Ryan Boatright scored 14. Young was Kentucky's top scorer with 20. Randle had 10 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assist. Napier was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four for both his offense and defense (he held Aaron Harrison to 7 points). As a team Connecticut was 10 for 10 from the free throw line, while Kentucky was 13 of 24. Connecticut became the first team to make all their attempts in a title game, and finished the tournament with an 87.8% free throw rate. That surpassed St. John's 87.0% in 1969 for the best percentage in NCAA history.\nThe announced attendance for the game was 79,238, an NCAA record for a Tournament Final.\nAfter UConn's win in the men's division, the following night their women's team beat Notre Dame for a sweep of both the men's and women's Division I basketball championships. UConn also accomplished this sweep in 2004, the only other time the feat was accomplished.\nMedia coverage.\nThe Championship Game was broadcast in the United States by CBS. Jim Nantz was the play-by-play man with Greg Anthony and Steve Kerr providing on-court commentary. Greg Gumbel and Ernie Johnson Jr. were the studio hosts. Charles Barkley, Seth Davis, Grant Hill, Clark Kellogg, and Kenny Smith provided studio commentary. ESPN International owned the broadcast rights outside the United States. Dan Shulman was the play-by-play announcer for the international audience, with Dick Vitale providing commentary. The broadcast averaged 21.2 million viewers and peaked at 24.3 million viewers between 11 pm and 11:30 pm.\nRadio coverage in the United States was provided by Westwood One. The Championship Game was streamed live for free on NCAA.com."

        "text": "The 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 8, 2013, at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia, and featured the Midwest Regional Champion, #1-seeded Louisville, and the South Regional Champion, #4-seeded Michigan.\nLouisville's title was subsequently vacated by the NCAA on June 15, 2017, as the result of a sex scandal involving players on the team, as well as potential recruits. This decision was upheld on February 20, 2018.\nParticipants.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan, who was led by 2013 national player of the year Trey Burke, was a #4 seed in the South Regional of the 2013 NCAA tournament. In the 2nd round, Glenn Robinson III scored 21 points to lead the Wolverines past South Dakota State 71–56. In the 3rd Round, Michigan crushed VCU with a 78–53 win to advance to the Sweet 16 for the 1st time since 1994. Against Kansas, Burke made a long game-tying three-pointer with 4.2 seconds left to send the game to overtime, and Michigan would then win to advance to the Elite Eight. Michigan routed Florida 79–59 to advance to the Final Four for the 1st time since 1993. Against Syracuse, with Michigan leading 58–56 with 19.2 seconds left, Jordan Morgan took the charge and Brandon Triche was called for an offensive foul. Then, Jon Horford made 1 of 2 free throws for a 59–56 lead. With 6 seconds left, Trevor Cooney missed a jump shot and Tim Hardaway Jr. got the rebound, then Caris LeVert threw it all the way to Morgan, who would dunk it in for a 61–56 win over Syracuse and a trip to the national championship game.\nMichigan was competing for its second national championship. This was the Wolverines’ sixth national title game appearance (1965, 1976, 1989, 1992, 1993), and its first since 1993, where the Fab Five-led Wolverines fell to North Carolina.\nLouisville Cardinals.\nLouisville was the #1 overall seed in the 2013 NCAA tournament and was placed in the Midwest Regional. Louisville had no trouble beating North Carolina A&amp;T in the 2nd round with an easy 79–48 win. In the 3rd Round, Russ Smith scored 27 points as Louisville crushed Colorado State 82–56. In the Sweet 16, Russ Smith scored 31 points to beat Oregon 77–69 for a trip to the Elite Eight. Then the Cardinals overcame Kevin Ware's injury to beat Duke 85–63 and advance to the 2013 Final Four. Louisville survived the surprising Wichita State team to advance to the 2013 National Championship Game.\nThis was Louisville's third trip to the National Title Game and it also vied for its third national title, which was later vacated.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nTrey Burke scored seven quick points to get Michigan out to an early 7–3 lead. But then he picked up two fouls and would be forced to sit on the bench. Spike Albrecht, replacing him, made four consecutive three-pointers leading to a 17-point first-half performance and Michigan would be up 35–23. But, Luke Hancock made four consecutive three-pointers to cut the Michigan lead to 38–37 at halftime.\nSecond half.\nThe 2nd half featured several lead changes, then with 5:09 remaining, Trey Burke was called for a controversial foul on a block attempt of a Peyton Siva layup. Siva made both free throws for a Louisville 69–64 lead. With 3:27 left, Luke Hancock made a three-pointer to give Louisville a 76–66 lead. Michigan took the game to an 80–76 deficit with 14 seconds left, but Siva made two free throws to give Louisville an 82–76 win. With 22 points, Hancock was named the 2013 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player.\nThis was the third consecutive loss in the championship game for Michigan, bringing their record in the title game to 1–5.\nAftermath.\nOn February 20, 2018, the NCAA announced that the wins and records for Louisville's 2011–12, 2012–13, 2013–14, and 2014–15 seasons were vacated due to the sex scandal at Louisville, including the 2013 National Championship. Louisville became the first team in college basketball history to vacate a national championship, and the second team overall to vacate a national championship in college sports after USC vacated its 2004 national championship after an investigation into the eligibility of Reggie Bush. Unlike forfeiture, a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win, only with Louisville removing the wins from its own record.\nMichigan would return to the national championship game in 2018, but they would lose to Villanova. This brought the Wolverines' record in the national championship game to 1–6, the worst record among teams that have previously won a national championship."

        "text": "The 1936 United States men's Olympic basketball team competed in the Games of the XI Olympiad in Berlin, representing the United States of America, and was coached by Jimmy Needles of the Amateur Athletic Union's Universal Pictures team. Gene Johnson of Wichita University assisted Needles, while Joe Reilly served as the team's director. 1936 was the first year that basketball was an official medal sport (it had been a demonstration sport in 1904). The U.S. won the first gold medal, defeating Canada, 19–8, in a gold medal match played outdoors on a clay and sand court in the rain. James Naismith, the game's inventor, watched many of the 1936 Olympic basketball matches, and helped award medals at the end of the basketball competition.\nRoster.\nRoster for the 1936 Olympics.\nOlympic trials.\nAs was the custom at the time, the Olympic trials consisted of a tournament between top teams from the Amateur Athletic Union, the YMCA and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. One notably absent team from the tournament was the 1935–36 Long Island Blackbirds, who had just completed a 25–0 season behind stars Jules Bender, Ben Kramer and Art Hillhouse. The largely Jewish Blackbirds team boycotted the trials due to the games being held in Berlin. LIU president Tristram Walker Metcalfe stated: \"Our conviction that the United States should not participate in the Olympic Games since they are being held in Germany has not been altered by the fact that our basketball team is now recognized generally as a possible Olympic representative. Such participation would be indirect, if not direct, contribution of the raising of funds to finance such participation.\"\nOlympic tournament.\nAs the U.S. team arrived, they were made aware of several FIBA rules that were quite different than what the team was accustomed to in the States. There was no three second rule (which had then just been introduced to U.S. play), teams were limited to rosters of seven total players, and all games were to be played outdoors on a surface which was a mixture of sand and clay and which had been that of a tennis court. Needles successfully protested another stipulation – that players had to be 6'2\" or shorter to compete. To get around the seven-player team limit, Needles split the squad into two teams – one featuring the McPherson Globe Refiners players and collegian Ralph Bishop, and one featuring the AAU Universal players – and alternated them for each match.\nTheir first match was won in a forfeit, as their scheduled opponent Spain, in the throes of the Spanish Civil War, never showed up. In the second match, the Universal team routed Estonia, by a score of 52–28. A McPherson-led win over the Philippines landed the Americans in the medal round, where they defeated Mexico, to reach the gold medal game.\nThe gold medal game was played after a day of rain, and the weather conditions put a damper on the Canadian national team's trademark fast break playing style. The two teams were only able to manage a combined total of eight points in the second half of play, due to the downpour, and the U.S. won the gold medal with a 19–8 victory."

        "text": "The 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and it determined the national champion for the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 2, 2012, at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana, and featured the South Regional Champion, #1-seeded Kentucky and the Midwest Regional Champion, #2-seeded Kansas. The two head coaches for this game, Kentucky's John Calipari and Kansas's Bill Self also coached at the 2008 National Championship Game where Bill Self was coaching for Kansas and John Calipari was coaching for Memphis. This was a rematch of a regular season encounter at the 2011 Champions Classic, which Kentucky had won 75–65.\nParticipants.\nKansas Jayhawks.\nKansas entered the tournament as the #2 seed in the Midwest Regional. In the 2nd Round, Thomas Robinson had a double-double with 16 points and 13 rebounds as Kansas beat Detroit 65–50. In the 3rd round against Purdue trailing 60–59, Elijah Johnson got the steal and layup to take a 61–60 lead and with 3 seconds left, Tyshawn Taylor made a dunk for a 63–60 win. In the Sweet 16 against NC State, Jeff Withey blocked 10 shots to survive with a 60–57 victory. In the Elite Eight, Tyshawn Taylor finally got hot with 22 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, and 5 steals as Kansas beat North Carolina 80–67 to advance to the Final Four. In the Final Four, Ohio State got off to a strong start and had a 26–13 lead at one point and then, Kansas managed to control Jared Sullinger to beat the Buckeyes 64–62 and advance to the 2012 National Championship Game.\nKentucky Wildcats.\nKentucky entered the tournament as the #1 overall seed and was placed in the South Regional. The Wildcats dominated Western Kentucky in an 81–66 victory. In the 3rd round, after being up 38–27 at halftime, Kentucky pulled away from Iowa State to advance to the Sweet 16. In the Sweet 16, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scored 24 points to take revenge on Indiana with a 102–90 win. Indiana beat Kentucky on December 10, 2011, at Assembly Hall on a Christian Watford buzzer-beater. The Wildcats managed to beat Baylor in the Elite Eight with an 82–70 win to earn a spot in the Final Four. In the National Semifinal, Anthony Davis had a double-double with 18 points and 14 rebounds to lead Kentucky to the 2012 National Championship Game with a 69–61 win over Louisville.\nGame summary.\n1st Half.\nDespite no points from Naismith Trophy winner Anthony Davis in the 1st 9 and a quarter minutes, Kentucky got off to a hot start with Michael Kidd-Gilchrist scoring 7 of his 11 points, Doron Lamb 6 points, and Marquis Teague and Terrence Jones each 4 points in that same time frame as Kentucky would have a 23–14 lead and Kansas would be forced to call timeout. The Wildcats kept their dominance to lead 41–27 at halftime despite no points from Davis, as Kidd-Gilchrist scored all 11 of his points in the 1st half, Lamb had 12 points, and Teague had nine. For the Jayhawks, Thomas Robinson and Tyshawn Taylor each scored eight points, and Jeff Withey scored 5.\n2nd Half.\nAnthony Davis's 1st point of the night came with a made free throw with 15:30 left to give Kentucky a 44–30 lead. Elijah Johnson scored four points in 15 seconds to cut the Kentucky lead to 46–34 and force a timeout. But, with Kentucky up 48–38, Doron Lamb made two three-pointers on 40 seconds for a 54–38 lead. Davis's 1st field goal of the night came with a made jump shot with 5:14 left to give Kentucky a 59–44 lead. Then, Tyshawn Taylor scored six points in one minute, and Thomas Robinson made a pair of free throws to cut the lead to 59–52. Kansas kept its comeback effort going with an Elijah Johnson three-pointer and Robinson making a pair of free throws, cutting their deficit to 62–57. Kentucky was able to hold on when Davis made a free throw, and Marquis Teague and Lamb each made a pair of free throws for a 67–59 victory."

        "text": "The 2014–15 Mount St. Mary's Mountaineers men's basketball team represented Mount St. Mary's University during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Mountaineers played their home games at Knott Arena, a 3,500-seat facility on the university's campus in Emmitsburg, Maryland. For the 26th season, the team was a member of the Northeast Conference.\nThe team was led by third-year head coach Jamion Christian, who prior to the season was given a contract extension to coach the team through the 2018–19 season.\nNewcomers to the team included Chris Martin and Andrew Smeathers, transfers from Marshall and Butler, respectively. Martin joined the team at the beginning of the season; however, due to NCAA transfer rules, Smeathers was unable to join the team until the December 20 game against American, the first game after the end of the fall semester. Other incoming players included freshmen Troy Henderson, Chris Manning, Lamont \"Junior\" Robinson, Mawdo \"Mo\" Sallah and Chris Wray. At 5-foot-5, Robinson was the shortest player in Division I men's basketball for the 2014–15 season.\nThe Mountaineers finished the season 15–15, 11–7 in NEC play, to finish fourth in the conference. They lost in the quarterfinals of the 2015 NEC tournament to St. Francis (PA).\nPrevious season.\nThe 2013–14 Mountaineers finished the regular season with a record of 13–16 (9–7 in the Northeast Conference) and qualified for the conference tournament as the #4 seed. They defeated St. Francis Brooklyn at home in the first game before winning road games against Wagner and Robert Morris to win the conference championship for the fourth time.\nWith a record of 16–16, the Mountaineers were seeded in the 2014 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament as a co-16 seed in the South Region and played Albany in a First Four game. The Mountaineers were defeated by the Great Danes, 71–64, and finished the season with a 16–17 record.\nIncoming freshmen.\nChris Wray, a 6-foot-8 forward who attended Fishburne Military School in Waynesboro, Virginia, announced his intention to play for Mount St. Mary's in September 2012 while he was a senior at Shelby High School in North Carolina. As a junior at Shelby High prior to his commitment, he averaged more than 11 points and 6 rebounds.\nLamont \"Junior\" Robinson, a 5-foot-5 point guard from Mebane, North Carolina, announced in June 2013 that he was giving a verbal commitment to Mount St. Mary's. Robinson averaged 22 points and 5.3 assists per game in his senior year at Eastern Alamance High School, and was named to North Carolina's all-state team.\nMawdo \"Mo\" Sallah, a 6-foot-8 center, announced his commitment to Mount St. Mary's in October 2013. A native-born Gambian, Sallah came to the United States as a teenager and attended Broadfording Christian Academy in Hagerstown, Maryland, before going to Fishburne Military School as a post-graduate. In his senior year at BCA, Sallah averaged 18 points, 14.8 rebounds and 4.5 blocked shots.\nChris Manning, a 6-foot-7 forward from Randallstown, Maryland, committed to Mount St. Mary's in May 2013. Troy Henderson, a 6-foot-9 forward from Gastonia, North Carolina, joined the Mountaineers after a senior season at Gaston Day School during which he averaged 12 points, 8 rebounds and 4 blocks. Both Manning and Henderson were redshirted for the 2014–15 season by Mount St. Mary's.\nIncoming transfers.\nChris Martin, a 6-foot-0 shooting guard from Upper Marlboro, Maryland, transferred to Mount St. Mary's from Marshall in April 2013. Pursuant to NCAA transfer rules, Martin sat out the 2013–14 season and joined the team in 2014–15. In two seasons with Marshall, Martin appeared in 41 games and averaged 2.3 points per game.\nAndrew Smeathers, a 6-foot-8 forward from Bargersville, Indiana, announced in December 2013 that he would be transferring to Mount St. Mary's from Butler. During his two seasons at Butler, Smeathers scored just 63 points. Because of the timing of his transfer, Smeathers had to sit out the Mountaineers' first eight games of the 2014–15 season before he was eligible to play.\nPre-season.\nDespite having advanced to the NCAA tournament in the 2013–14 season as winners of the 2014 NEC tournament, the Mountaineers were ranked fifth of the 10 teams in the conference in its preseason poll. This was due in part to the team having lost its three leading scorers from the previous season (Julian Norfleet, Rashad Whack and Sam Prescott) to graduation.\nThe website Big Apple Buckets, which covers college basketball in the Northeast, named Chris Martin to its Preseason NEC All-Conference Third Team, saying that he \"may struggle during the Mount’s insanely difficult non-conference schedule, but by the time NEC play rolls around, we expect the Marshall transfer to lead his team in scoring and be a pest defensively. His ability to score a variety of ways will help temper the loss of the graduating Big Three.\"\nOn November 1, the team played a scrimmage against Division III Randolph–Macon College.\nRegular season.\nNon-conference play.\nNovember.\nMount St. Mary's began the season on November 14 with a 78–55 loss on the road against the #2-ranked team in the nation, Arizona. The Mountaineers were within seven points with 11 minutes to play before fading down the stretch.\nThe Mountaineers dropped their home opener against Maryland Eastern Shore, 53–41, to fall to 0–2 on the season. Byron Ashe led the Mountaineers with nine points as the team shot just 29.8 percent (14 of 47) from the field.\nThe Mountaineers got their first win of the season with a 73–69 win on the road against Bucknell. Gregory Graves led the way with 16 points and seven rebounds.\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, the Mountaineers suffered a 34-point loss to ACC opponent Wake Forest to fall to 1–3 on the season. Walk-on player Liam MacManimon led Mount St. Mary's with 10 points.\nDecember.\nMount St. Mary's fell to 1–4 on the season a 23-point loss to Seton Hall on December 2. The Pirates took a 30–19 lead in the game's first 12 minutes and never looked back.\nIn the 170th meeting of a rivalry dubbed the Catholic Clash, the Mountaineers defeated Loyola. With the win, in which the Mountaineers shot 11-of-19 from three-point range, Mount St. Mary's took a 98–72 all-time lead in the series.\nMount St. Mary's then faced their second ranked opponent of the season, #25 Notre Dame, and fell to 2–5 with a 93–67 loss. Chris Martin led the Mountaineers with 19 points, including 5-of-9 from three-point range.\nThe Mountaineers got their first home win of the season on December 13 with a 67–64 overtime victory over Norfolk State. Taylor Danaher sealed the win by blocking a three-point shot in the waning seconds.\nAmerican defeated the Mountaineers 46–45 on December 20 on a last-second tip-in, dropping the Mountaineers to 3–6 on the season. Mount St. Mary's outrebounded the Eagles 35–27, but they shot only 34 percent (17-of-50) from the field.\nThe Mountaineers nearly lost a home game to one of the worst teams in Division I, Binghamton, before escaping with a 69–68 win. The game marked the home debut of transfer Andrew Smeathers, and he hit two free throws with 2.9 seconds to play to give the Mountaineers the win.\nOn December 29, the Mountaineers were defeated 69–35 by Conference USA's Old Dominion to finish non-conference play with a record of 4–7. In the game, the Mountaineers shot just 22 percent from the field (including 3-of-23 from three-point range) and had more turnovers (14) than field goals made (11).\nNortheast Conference play.\nJanuary.\nThe Mountaineers started conference play with two consecutive losses: a 70–45 loss to Robert Morris and a double-overtime loss to Wagner. The team soundly defeated Central Connecticut, 82–51, on January 8 for its first conference win of the season. Another home victory, over conference-leading St. Francis Brooklyn, followed two days later.\nThe Mountaineers' winning streak continued with a 20-point road victory over Fairleigh Dickinson and a 61–54 defeat of LIU Brooklyn in the Barclays Center, during which the Mountaineers overcame a 21-point first-half deficit. The winning streak was halted by a 63–59 overtime loss to Robert Morris, who completed a season sweep of the Mountaineers with the victory.\nAfter beating Saint Francis (PA) on January 24, the Mountaineers were defeated in overtime in their rematch with St. Francis Brooklyn. They then defeated Sacred Heart on January 31 to finish the month with a 6–4 conference record, 10–11 overall.\nFebruary.\nThe Mountaineers fell to 6–5 in conference play February 5 when their late comeback fell short and they lost to Bryant, 55–53. For the third consecutive time, however, the team followed a loss with a victory, defeating Central Connecticut for the second time on the season, 63–46.\nIn their return home after a four-game road trip, the Mountaineers were defeated by Sacred Heart, 62–55, on February 12. Two days later, led by a career-high 24 points from Byron Ashe, the team got a victory at home over Bryant, 75–68. On February 19, the Mountaineers got 54 points off their bench and improved to the .500 mark (13–13) for the first time on the season with an 82–65 win over LIU Brooklyn. On February 21, Mount St. Mary's pulled into a three-way tie for second place in the conference at 10–6 after defeating Fairleigh Dickinson, 75–64.\nOn February 26, despite a loss on the road to Saint Francis (PA), the Mountaineers clinched a home game in the first round of the conference tournament. On February 28, Mount St. Mary's beat Wagner, 74–64, to finish the regular season with a record of 15–14 (11–7 in conference play).\nConference Tournament.\nMount St. Mary's qualified for the NEC tournament as the No. 4 seed. Big Apple Buckets ran 10,000 simulations of the conference tournament prior to its start, giving the Mountaineers a 27% chance of reaching the championship game and an 11% chance of winning the title.\nIn the quarterfinals at Knott Arena on March 4, the Mountaineers lost 73–58 to Saint Francis (PA), the No. 5 seed, and were eliminated from the tournament. It marked only the third time Mount St. Mary's lost an NEC Tournament game at home, and the first time since 2006. In addition, it was the first time the Mountaineers lost to Saint Francis (PA) at the Knott Arena since 2004.\nSpeaking after the game, Christian said \"I think a little bit of our inexperience did hit us.\"\nPostseason.\nThree teams from the NEC were given bids to postseason tournaments; however, Mount St. Mary's was not one. Robert Morris went to the NCAA tournament as winners of the conference tournament; St. Francis Brooklyn went to the NIT as regular-season NEC champions; and Saint Francis (PA) was awarded a bid to the CIT.\nMartin transferred again following the season, this time to Savannah State University. Smeathers also left the program after the season, citing injuries.\nAwards.\nOn March 3, the Northeast Conference officially named Byron Ashe and Gregory Graves to its All-Conference Third Team, saying Ashe's \"emergence as a legitimate scoring and outside shooting threat gave Mount St. Mary's the spark it needed this season as the team looked to fill the void left by the graduation of three 1,000-point scorers\" and Graves was a \"much-improved offensive contributor this season (who) handles much of the dirty work inside for the Mount and its \"Mayhem\" approach.\" Junior Robinson, who \"already has proven to be a big time player for the Mount after assuming the starting point guard spot from game one\", was named to the All-Conference Rookie Team.\n\"Big Apple Buckets\" also named Ashe and Graves to its NEC All-Conference Third Team, saying Ashe \"emerged as a better player and the Mount’s go-to-scorer, posting double-digit point totals in nine of his last 10 games\", while Graves displayed \"dominance on the boards, as he impressively grabbed 9.6% and 21.2% of the offensive and defensive rebounds.\" The site also named Robinson to its NEC All-Conference Rookie Team, saying he \"utilized his elite speed and quickness to post double-digits in scoring for half of his conference games.\"\nAshe was also named Second Team All-District by the National Association of Basketball Coaches.\nMedia.\nMountaineers home games and select road games were broadcast on WTHU 1450 AM in Thurmont, Maryland. Play-by-play was by Adam Pohl, with color commentary by Roy Sigler.\nLive streaming video of all conference games and out-of-conference home games was available at www.necfrontrow.com.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=11 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Northeast Conference tournament\nStatistics.\nPlayers.\nNEC Leaders.\nScoring\nRebounding\nField Goal Percentage (minimum 3 made per game)\nAssists\nSteals\n3-Point Field Goal Percentage (minimum 1 made per game)\n3-Point Field Goals Made\nBlocked Shots\nAssist/Turnover Ratio (minimum 3 assists/game)\nOffensive Rebounds\nDefensive Rebounds\nMinutes Played\nTeam.\nThe Mountaineers finished the season ranked ninth of the 10 teams in the Northeast Conference in points scored per game (63.1), and third of the 10 teams in fewest points allowed per game (64.8).

        "text": "The Oceanian section of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification acted as qualifiers for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Russia, for national teams which are members of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC). A total of 0.5 slots (i.e. 1 inter-confederation play-off slot) in the final tournament was available for OFC teams.\nThe 2016 edition of the OFC Nations Cup once again doubled as the second round of the OFC qualifying competition for the 2018 FIFA World Cup (similar to the 2012 OFC Nations Cup and the OFC qualifying competition for the 2014 FIFA World Cup). Unlike in 2012, however, the team that won the qualifying competition and advanced to the intercontinental play-off, New Zealand, was the same team that also won the OFC Nations Cup and represented the OFC at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nFormat.\nThe qualification structure was as follows:\nThe OFC had considered different proposals of the qualifying tournament. A previous proposal adopted by the OFC in October 2014 had the eight teams divided into two groups of four teams to play home-and-away round-robin matches in the second round, followed by the top two teams of each group advancing to the third round to play in a single group of home-and-away round-robin matches to decide the winner of the 2016 OFC Nations Cup which would both qualify to the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup and advance to the inter-confederation play-offs. However, it was later reported in April 2015 that the OFC had reversed its decision, and the 2016 OFC Nations Cup will be played as a one-off tournament similar to the 2012 OFC Nations Cup.\nEntrants.\nAll 11 FIFA-affiliated national teams from the OFC entered qualification. The four lowest ranked teams (based on FIFA World Ranking and sporting reasons) entered the first round, while the other seven teams entered the second round.\nSchedule.\nThe schedule of the competition was as follows.\nThe inter-confederation play-offs were scheduled to be played between 6–14 November 2017.\nFirst round.\nThe match schedule was revealed on 30 July 2015, following a draw held at OFC Headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand.\nSecond round.\nThe draw for the second round was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nKnockout stage.\nWhile the results of the OFC Nations Cup knockout stage matches have no effect on the teams qualified for the third round of World Cup qualifying, for statistical purposes these matches are considered part of World Cup qualifying, with FIFA counting goalscorers in the qualifying statistics, and cards given may contribute to suspensions in the third round of World Cup qualifying (similar to the setup for 2014 World Cup qualifying).\nThird round.\nThe draw for the third round was held on 8 July 2016, 11:00 NZST (), at the OFC headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand.\nFinal.\nThe draw for the final (which decided the order of legs) was held on 15 June 2017, 16:00 NZST (), at the OFC headquarters in Auckland, New Zealand.\nThe winner of the final advanced to inter-confederation play-offs. Dates were set for the two-legged final as being between 28 August and 5 September 2017.\nNew Zealand defeated Solomon Islands 8-3 on aggregate and advanced to the OFC-CONMEBOL play-off\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe draw for the inter-confederation play-offs was held as part of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Preliminary Draw on 25 July 2015, starting 18:00 MSK (), at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg.

        "text": "The 2015 Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Sunday May 24, 2015. It was the premier event of the 2015 season of the Verizon IndyCar Series. Juan Pablo Montoya won his second Indianapolis 500, followed in the finish by Will Power, Charlie Kimball, polesitter Scott Dixon, and Graham Rahal.\nFor the second year in a row, the month of May activities opened with the Grand Prix of Indianapolis over May 7–9. Practice opened on May 11, and time trials were held on May 16–17. Rain interrupted and eventually washed out time trials on May 16, and all qualifications were held on Sunday May 17.\nThe victory capped off a successful return to Indy car racing for Montoya. The 1999 CART champion and 2000 Indy 500 winner had left American open-wheel racing for Formula One for 2001–2005. He then switched to the NASCAR Cup Series, and also competed in Grand Am. Out of Indy car racing for thirteen seasons, Montoya surprisingly signed with Team Penske for 2014, and finished 5th in the 2014 race, only his second Indy 500 start. Later that year he won the Pocono 500, and by winning the 2015 Indy 500, set a record for most years between two victories - fifteen years (2000 and 2015).\nThe 2015 race saw the debut of unique aero kits from Chevrolet and Honda, respectively, outfitted for the Dallara DW12 chassis. As part of the ICONIC project, aero kits were originally planned for 2012, but a series of delays due to cost issues put off their homologation and implementation until 2015. During practice, three Chevrolet entries suffered major crashes that resulted in flip-overs. The crashes raised safety concerns around the paddock, and series officials delayed time trials for several hours in order to address the situation with rule and procedural changes, removing qualifying from its status as a points-paying event.\nDuring a practice session on May 18, IndyCar's Holmatro Safety Team was lauded for a life-saving effort in their rescue of driver James Hinchcliffe. During the run, Hinchcliffe was involved in a major crash, and was impaled by a suspension member. The rapid response by the medical crews was credited with likely saving his life, and nine days later he was released from Methodist Hospital, expected to make a full recovery. Hinchcliffe was able to drive the IndyCar two-seater at a promotional event in August at the Golden Gate Bridge, then made his first competitive laps in a Dan Wheldon Memorial karting event in September.\nSchedule.\nTrack activities began on Sunday May 3, with Opening Day, featuring the debut of oval aero kits. A full-field open test and rookie orientation took place on the oval from 9:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. During the week, the track was reconfigured to the road course configuration. After the Grand Prix was concluded, the track was closed on Mother's Day, unlike 2014. On Sunday May 10, the track was converted back to the oval configuration, meanwhile, teams had the day to convert the cars from road course to oval set-up.\nThe track re-opened in oval configuration starting Monday May 11. A second session of rookie orientation was reserved for the track on Monday (if needed), with veterans taking to the track in the afternoon. Practice on Tuesday through Friday was held from 12 noon to 6 p.m. For the second year in a row, a post-qualifying practice session was held on the Monday after pole day. For the second year in a row, time trials were conducted with a combined two-day format. The 33 cars that comprised the field was determined on Saturday, while the starting lineup was set on Sunday.\nTesting and Rookie orientation.\nRookie Orientation / Refresher tests – Sunday May 3.\nThe track was reserved for rookie orientation from 10:45 a.m. to 12 p.m. The 40-lap rookie test consists of three phases, demonstrating car control, placement, and a consistent driving pattern. Phase one consists of 10 laps at 205-210 mph, phase two consists of 15 laps at 210-215 mph, and phase three requires 15 laps at over 215 mph. Series rookie Gabby Chaves completed all three phases, while Stefano Coletti was out of the country and completed the test on May 11.\nRefresher tests were completed by Bryan Clauson, Simona de Silvestro, Oriol Servià, Pippa Mann, Justin Wilson, James Jakes, Conor Daly and Sage Karam. Davey Hamilton came out of retirement to drive the Dreyer &amp; Reinbold/Kingdom Racing entry to shake down the car as a substitute for Townsend Bell, who was competing in the IMSA Monterey Sports Car Championships at Laguna Seca.\nPromoter's open test – Sunday May 3.\nOpening day featured a full-field open test on Sunday May 3, concentrating on the new oval aero kits. The track was available for veteran drivers from 9:30 a.m. to 10:45 a.m., then for all drivers from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. A total of 28 cars completed 1,845 laps without incident. Juan Pablo Montoya led the speed chart with a top lap of 226.772 mph. A total of 21 drivers exceeded the fastest lap from opening day of 2014. Though Montoya was the over fastest for the day, Hélio Castroneves reportedly ran the fastest single lap without a tow.\nPractice.\nMonday May 11.\nThe first day of practice was scheduled for Monday May 11. The day opened with rookie orientation and refresher tests. J. R. Hildebrand and Townsend Bell led the early speeds during the refresher tests, while Stefano Coletti completed his rookie test. Heavy rain halted track activity at about 1:45 p.m. The track re-opened at 4:15 p.m. for full-field practice. At 4:32 p.m., James Jakes's crew suffered a broken inertial starter, which in-turn, threw debris and injured a crew member. At 6:15 p.m., Stefano Coletti did a half-spin in pit lane, but did not make contact. A total of 30 cars completed 1,094 laps, with Sage Karam (225.802 mph), the fastest overall for the day. Karam's Ganassi teammate Scott Dixon posted the fastest \"no-tow\" lap at 224.443 mph\nTuesday May 12.\nThe second day of practice was scheduled for May 12. At 2:07 p.m., Simona de Silvestro's car started smoking in the exit of turn two. Down the backstretch, a small fire broke out under the engine cover, and de Silvestro stopped the car near the warm up lane at the end of the backstretch. The car quickly became engulfed in flames, and de Silvestro quickly exited the car, uninjured. It was determined the fire was caused by a fuel leak in the refueling buckeye. Later in the day at 4:30 p.m., James Jakes car came to a stop at the entrance to the pit area with smoke pouring from the engine, and about 20 minutes later, Jack Hawksworth pulled into the grass in turn two with brake failure. The track closed five minutes early at 5:55 p.m. when Justin Wilson's engine blew going down the main stretch. Hélio Castroneves set the fast lap of the day, both overall (227.514 mph) and \"no-tow\" (225.315 mph). Several teams, including Andretti Autosport, Schmidt Peterson Motorsports, and Team Penske, went out together in groups, conducting drafting practice, ostensibly concentrating on race day set-ups.\nWednesday May 13.\nTwo single-car incidents marred the third full day of practice. At 12:45 p.m., Hélio Castroneves' car stepped out in turn one. He did a half-spin, and hit the outside wall in the south short chute with the left side of the car. Sliding backwards, the car became airborne and did a flip, landing upright in turn two. Castroneves walked away uninjured. In the final hour, Pippa Mann went high through the exit of turn four, and spun at the north end of the main stretch. The car slid and hit the inside wall, then hit the attenuator at the end of the pit wall. The car violently spun back on to the main stretch, and came to rest against the outside wall. Mann was not seriously injured.\nTrack activity was highlighted by Carlos Muñoz, who turned the first 230 mph lap of the month. His lap of 230.121 came during \"Happy Hour\" with about six minutes left in the day. After the crew worked during the afternoon to prepare his back-up car, Hélio Castroneves was back out on the track turning laps after his wreck earlier in the day. Scott Dixon (226.411 mph) posted the fastest \"no-tow\" lap.\nThursday May 14.\nThe second major crash in turn one in as many days occurred on Thursday. At 5:18 p.m., Josef Newgarden lost control in turn one, did a three-quarter spin, and hit the outside wall in the south short chute with the nose. The car flipped over, and slid to a rest upside-down near the entrance to turn two. Newgarden was uninjured, and the crash appeared vastly similar to Hélio Castroneves' a day earlier. The two accidents prompted officials to re-evaluate an optional Chevrolet aero kit rear wheel cap that had been installed on both cars.\nSimon Pagenaud led the speed chart both overall (228.793 mph) and on the \"no-tow\" list (227.628 mph). By the end of the day Thursday, a total of 34 car/driver combinations have been on the track, including Buddy Lazier, who made his first track appearance of the month (under INDYCAR rules, Lazier's program, a single-race program, is not permitted on the track until the Thursday of the week). The last hour of the track saw heavy activity, with over 20 cars on the track at once, conducting race simulations and drafting practice. Three-wide passes and aggressive dicing was observed.\nAside from the potential issues regarding the optional Chevy wheel caps, the Chevy teams also were on the track Thursday without the chassis wicker bill. Officials informed the manufacturers that the centerline chassis wicker would be deemed optional. Chevrolet technicians informed their teams to remove them, while Honda kept them on. Meanwhile, some Honda teams were running Thursday with a modified, single-element, rear wing configuration.\nFast Friday — Friday May 15.\nSimon Pagenaud led the speed chart on \"Fast Friday,\" the final day of practice before qualifications. It was the second day in a row Pagenaud was the top driver of the day, and it was the fastest lap turned thus far of the month. Hot and windy conditions kept the speeds down from expected. Teams were allowed increased turbocharger \"boost\" for Friday, and Scott Dixon set an early \"no tow\" speed of 230.655 mph during the first hour. No incidents were reported, however, many cars stayed off the track for most of the afternoon. Only 1,055 laps were completed all day, approximately half of previous days. A total of 33 out of 34 cars completed at least one lap over 225 mph.\nTime trials.\nFirst Day — Saturday May 16.\nThe first day of time trials was scheduled for Saturday May 16. Hélio Castroneves (233.474 mph) turned the fastest lap during the morning practice session, the fastest single lap at the track since 1996. Three cars (Carlos Huertas, Ryan Hunter-Reay, and Scott Dixon) got out onto the track to begin qualifying, but it began to rain during Dixon's run. Dixon had just completed his first lap at 231.357 mph. The rest of the day was washed out, and officials rescheduled time trials for Sunday. The three runs from Saturday were erased.\nSecond Day — Sunday May 17.\nThe second day of time trials was scheduled for Sunday May 17. After the rainout on Saturday, originally, the schedule for Sunday was to include practice, first round qualifying, and the annual Fast Nine Shootout. However, during the morning practice session, Ed Carpenter suffered a serious crash in turn two. The car did a half spin and hit the outside wall at the exit of turn two. Sliding backwards, the car flipped over, and slid to a stop upside-down. It was the third blowover crash by a Chevrolet for the week. Series officials postponed qualifying, and huddled with participants to address safety concerns. After a lengthy delay, rules were tweaked for qualifying. Cars were required to qualify in race trim, and the increased turbocharger \"boost\" for qualifying was eliminated. Each car would get one attempt, and the Fast Nine Shootout was scrapped. Time permitting, there would be a final row \"shootout\" amongst the four slowest cars to determine positions 31-33, as well as the lone car to be bumped.\nScott Dixon, who had his Saturday attempt interrupted by rain, was the third car out to qualify. His speed of 226.760 mph wound up being the fastest of the day. It held up all afternoon, as the rest of the field had to qualify in less-than-ideal track conditions. The entire qualifying line was completed without incident.\nDue to the last minute rule changes, championship points were not awarded for Indy 500 time trials results as planned. Tristan Vautier qualified the #19 car in substitution for James Davison, a pre-planned arrangement. Davison was racing in the Pirelli World Challenge event at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park the same weekend. Davison was set to take over the car on race day, and per series rules, the car would move to the rear of the field.\nLast row shootout.\nFour cars participated in a 45-minute \"shootout\" for the final three positions. Jack Hawksworth and KVSH Racing teammates Stefano Coletti, and Bryan Clauson completed runs, filling the field. Buddy Lazier, who was not able to make an attempt during the first round, was the only other car eligible. Because of INDYCAR rules, Lazier had limited practice laps for the month, and his first attempt was well short at 219.438 mph. The team made some drastic wing adjustments, and scrambled to get the car to the qualifying line in the final minutes. His second attempt was faster, but still shy of bumping his way into the field.\nPost-qualifying practice.\nMonday May 18, James Hinchcliffe life threatening incident.\nA post-qualifying practice session was scheduled for Monday May 18 from 12:30 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. Also on-track was the Indy Lights, coming off a weekend high-speed oval compatibility test at Chicagoland Speedway. The practice was marred by a massive crash around 12:45 p.m. involving James Hinchcliffe. Going into turn three, Hinchcliffe was drafting behind Juan Pablo Montoya. Suddenly the car suffered a right front suspension failure, and the car veered into the outside wall. The right side of the car was disintegrated, and the car slid through the north short chute, tilting up on one side, and coming to rest in turn four. Hinchcliffe was awake and alert, but was pinned in the cockpit and needed assistance from the car. One of the suspension pieces had penetrated the cockpit tub, and punctured Hinchcliffe's thigh, causing profuse bleeding. He was taken to Methodist Hospital for surgery to remove the debris from his thigh, and the quick response work by IndyCar safety crews was credited in likely saving his life. The track was closed while series officials made repairs to the SAFER Barrier, and investigated the cause of the crash. Up to the time of the crash, Simon Pagenaud (225.260 mph) had turned the fastest lap.\nThe schedule for the day was retooled, with Indy Lights practice moved up, and a second IndyCar practice session scheduled for two hours beginning at 4 p.m. Sage Karam (227.831 mph) set the fastest lap of the second session and overall for the day. The only other incident of the day belonged to Jack Hawksworth, who had an engine failure.\nSpecial Test - Thursday May 21.\nWith James Hinchcliffe out for the season due to his injuries, veteran Ryan Briscoe was named as a driver replacement in the #5 car. Briscoe (a full-time driver in 2014) had not driven any laps during the month thus far, and also had not yet driven an Indy car outfitted with the 2015 aero kits. IndyCar officials arranged a special one-hour refresher session for Briscoe to acclimate himself with the new aerodynamic specifications.\nCarb Day — Friday May 22.\nCarb day opened with news that Carlos Huertas had not been medically cleared to race due to an inner ear condition. Tristan Vautier was named to replace him in the number 18 car and was moved to the rear of the field for the race. Vautier had driven in a substitution role for James Davison during time trials, but was scheduled to fly to Silverstone for an endurance race. Vautier was at O'Hare International Airport waiting for his plane when he got a telephone call to return to Indianapolis.\nThe Carb Day practice session saw Will Power set the fastest lap of the day with a lap of 229.020 mph.

As the field pulled away for parade laps, Alex Tagliani remained stationary with issues getting the car into gear. The problem was eventually resolved and Tagliani resumed his spot in the starting lineup.\nAs the field continued the parade laps, fire erupted from underneath the car of Conor Daly. Daly pulled the car to a stop at the North short chute, his day was done before the race even began.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nScott Dixon led the field into turn one. As the field rounded turn one, the first incident of the day occurred when Sage Karam squeezed Takuma Sato into the turn 1 wall. Ryan Briscoe also spun trying to avoid the incident. Karam was out of the race, while Sato and Briscoe were able to effect repairs and continue.\nUnder caution, behind the pace car, as the field came around for the restart on lap 7, Simona de Silvestro rear-ended Juan Pablo Montoya, damaging de Silvestro's left-front wing and Montoya's right-rear bumper, which detached just before Montoya entered pit lane for repairs, causing an extended caution period to clear the debris. After two more restart attempts, the race finally went green on lap 13. The race became a three-way battle for the lead between Scott Dixon, Tony Kanaan, and Simon Pagenaud, with the three swapping the lead regularly. The first round of green flag pit stops briefly promoted Montoya, who had refueled during his stop for repairs, into the lead. When he pitted, Dixon resumed the lead.\nSecond quarter.\nThe second caution of the race came on lap 64, when Bryan Clauson drifted wide in turn four and hit the outside barrier. During yellow flag pit stops, Simon Pagenaud was able to jump ahead of the Chip Ganassi Racing teammates and take the lead.\nThe race restarted on lap 71, and the battle between Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan continued from where it left off. Another round of green flag pit stops came, during which Hélio Castroneves briefly inherited the lead. When stops were cycled through, Pagenaud emerged the leader again.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nThe third caution of the race came on lap 113, when Ed Carpenter clipped Oriol Servià and sent both into the wall in turn one. During this caution, an incident involving all three of the Dale Coyne Racing cars occurred on pit lane. James Davison was released just as his teammate Pippa Mann was passing his pit stall. The two made contact, and Davison slid into the car and crew of his other teammate, Tristan Vautier. Two crew members from Vautier's team were hit, and one suffered a broken ankle. Both Vautier and Davison retired from the race due to the incident.\nThe race restarted on lap 122, with Will Power joining Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan in the battle for the lead.\nFourth quarter.\nGreen flag pit stops again came with roughly 50 laps left in the race. As the pit stop cycle neared completion, the fourth caution of the race came on lap 153 as Tony Kanaan, fresh off a wing adjustment, lost control of his car in turn three and crashed. Alex Tagliani briefly held the lead, but surrendered it to make his pit stop.\nThe race restarted on lap 160 with Juan Pablo Montoya joining the battle for the lead, having finally recovered from the early race mishap. 7 laps later, the fifth caution of the day came out for a piece of debris that had come off of the car of Takuma Sato. The leaders made their last stops of the race during this caution, with Will Power coming out in front. Andretti Autosport teammates Justin Wilson and Carlos Muñoz elected to stay out during this sequence, with Muñoz inheriting the lead.\nThe race was restarted on lap 173, with Wilson and Muñoz quickly shuffled back by cars with fresher tires. As the field worked around the Andretti Autosport drivers on lap 176, Simon Pagenaud clipped the rear of Justin Wilson, causing front wing damage to Pagenaud's car and causing him to drop rapidly through the field. Only three turns later, a three-car crash occurred in turn 4 when Jack Hawksworth lost control of his car and hit Sebastián Saavedra from behind. Saavedra's car continued sliding back across the track and into the path of Stefano Coletti, who slammed into the front end of Saavedra's car. Saavedra needed assistance in climbing from his car and was later diagnosed with a foot contusion.\nThe race was restarted on lap 184 with Power in the lead. The last 13 laps saw the lead exchange hands four times between Dixon, Power and Montoya. With four laps remaining, Montoya slip-streamed around the outside of Power into turn one and took the lead. With clean air, Montoya was able to fend off Power for the remaining three laps and win the second Indianapolis 500 of his career.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe Grand Prix of Indianapolis and the Indianapolis 500 were broadcast live in the United States on ABC. Allen Bestwick was the anchor for the second year in a row. Jon Beekhuis joined the crew as pit reporter for the first time since 1999.\nThe Time Trials were originally scheduled to air on ABC.

Dave Furst reported from the center pits, and during the second half of the race, also reported from the garage area and medical center. Kevin Lee reported from the north-center pits, then in the latter stages of the race, moved towards the south end to help focus on some of the leaders. Doug Rice was stationed at the north end of the pit area, but focused nearly the entire race on the pit of eventual race winner Juan Pablo Montoya. After the race, Nick Yeoman interviewed the winner in victory lane.\nAfter featuring Paul Page's signature \"Delta Force\" theme music in 2014, the traditional \"The 500\" song was reprised for 2015. Among the guests interviewed in the booth was future Vice President of the United States and current Indiana Governor Mike Pence. Sponsor guests included Dan Ammann (GM), Jim Doyle (Panasonic), Dale Herrigle (Firestone), and James Verrier (BorgWarner).

        "text": "Naia (designated as HN5/48) is the name given to a 12,000 – to 13,000-year-old human skeleton of a teenage female who was found in the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico. Her bones were part of a 2007 discovery of a cache of animal bones in an underwater chamber called Hoyo Negro (Spanish for \"Black Hole\") in the Sistema Sac Actun. At the time of Naia's death, the cave system was mostly dry, and she likely died falling into Hoyo Negro.\nThe remains have been described as the \"oldest, most complete and genetically intact human skeleton in the New World\".\nGenetic testing.\nThe original report stated that \"HN5/48 is among the small group of Paleoamerican skeletons, a group that is morphologically distinct from most Native Americans but within the natural variation of Asian-Pacific populations.\"\nGenetic testing indicated a genetic link between Paleoamericans and modern indigenous peoples of the Americas as testing found MtDNA haplotype D1. Haplogroup D (mtDNA) is believed to have arisen in Asia. D1 is also found in Central Asia and is one of the founding lineages in the Americas. Subhaplogroup D1 occurs in 10.5% of extant Native Americans, with highest frequency of 29% in indigenous people from Chile and Argentina.\nThe report concluded that \"HN5/48 shows that the distinctive craniofacial morphology and generalized dentition of Paleoamericans can co-occur with a Beringian derived mtDNA haplogroup. This 13–12 ka Paleoamerican skeleton thus suggests that Paleoamericans represent an early population expansion out of Beringia, not an earlier migration from elsewhere in Eurasia. This is consistent with hypotheses that both Paleoamericans and Native Americans derive from a single source population, whether or not all share a lineal relationship ... the differences in craniofacial form between Native Americans and their Paleoamerican predecessors are best explained as evolutionary changes that postdate the divergence of Beringians from their Siberian ancestors.\"\nEvidence from full genomic studies suggests that the first people in the Americas (both Paleoamericans and later contemporary Native Americans) diverged from Ancient East Asians about 36,000 years ago and expanded northwards into Siberia, where they encountered and interacted with a different Paleolithic Siberian population (known as Ancient North Eurasians), giving rise to both Paleosiberian peoples and Ancient Native Americans, which later migrated towards the Beringian region, became isolated from other populations, and subsequently populated the Americas.\nImpact on the American skull morphology debate.\nA report published in the \"American Journal of Physical Anthropology\" in January 2015 looked again at craniofacial variation focusing on differences between early and late Native Americans and explanations for these based on either skull morphology or molecular genetics. Arguments based on molecular genetics have in the main, according to the authors, accepted a single migration from Asia with a probable pause in Berengia, plus later bi-directional gene flow.\nStudies focusing on craniofacial morphology have argued that Paleoamerican remains have \"been described as much closer to Polynesian and Australo-Melanesians populations than to the modern series of Native Americans\", suggesting two entries into the Americas, an early one occurring before a distinctive East Asian morphology developed (referred to in the paper as the \"Two Components Model\").\nA third model, the \"Recurrent Gene Flow\" [RGF] model, attempts to reconcile the two, arguing that circumarctic gene flow after the initial migration could account for morphological changes. Noting that the original report on the Hoyo Negro skeleton supported the RGF model, the authors disagreed with the conclusion that the skull shape did not match those of modern Native Americans, instead arguing that the \"skull falls into a subregion of the morphospace occupied by both Paleoamericans and some modern Native Americans.\""

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball single-game runs batted in leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a run batted in (RBI) is awarded to a batter for each runner who scores as a result of the batter's action, including a hit, fielder's choice, sacrifice fly, sacrifice bunt, catcher's interference, or a walk or hit by pitch with the bases loaded. A batter is also awarded an RBI for scoring himself upon hitting a home run. Sixteen players have batted in at least 10 runs in a single Major League Baseball (MLB) game to date, the most recent being Mark Reynolds of the Washington Nationals on July 6, 2018. No player has accomplished the feat more than once in his career and no player has ever recorded more than 12 RBIs in a game. Wilbert Robinson was the first player to record at least 10 RBIs in a single game, driving in 11 runs for the Baltimore Orioles against the St. Louis Browns on June 10, 1892.\n, every team that has had a player achieve the milestone has won the game in which it occurred. These games have resulted in other single-game MLB records being set due to the prodigious offensive performance. Robinson, for example, also amassed seven hits in that same game, setting a new major league record that has since been tied by only one other player. Mark Whiten hit four home runs to complement his 12 RBIs for the St. Louis Cardinals on September 7, 1993, tying the single-game records in both categories. By attaining both milestones, he became one of only two players to hit four home runs and drive in 10 or more runs in the same game, with Scooter Gennett being the other. Tony Lazzeri, Rudy York, and Nomar Garciaparra hit two grand slams during their 10 RBI game, equaling the record for most grand slams in one game. Norm Zauchin has the fewest career RBIs among players who have 10 RBIs in one game with 159, while Alex Rodriguez, with 2,086, drove in more runs than any other player in this group and hit the third most in major league history.\nOf the eight players eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have batted in 10 runs in a game, four have been elected and one was elected on the first ballot. Players are eligible for the Hall of Fame if they have played in at least 10 MLB seasons, and have either been retired for five seasons or deceased for at least six months. These requirements leave three players ineligible who are living and have played in the past five seasons and two—Phil Weintraub and Zauchin—who did not play in 10 seasons.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

This season marked the 115th season of basketball at Indiana University.\nThe Hoosiers went 20–14 overall and 9–9 in the Big Ten Conference to finish in a tie for seventh place. Much of the Hoosiers' difficulties were caused by a lack of defense and post presence. The Hoosiers improved over last season, where they didn't appear in any postseason tournament, by being selected to play in the NCAA tournament as a #10 seed in the Midwest region. They made an early exit as #7 Wichita State knocked them off in the second round.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoosiers finished the season with an overall record of 17–15, with a record of 7–11 in the Big Ten regular season, tying for eighth place. After not being selected to play in the NIT, Indiana chose not to accept an invitation to the CBI claiming, \"We're Indiana. We don't play in the CBI\".\nPreseason.\nThe Hoosiers began the preseason with a five-game trip to Canada in August. They finished 4–1, shooting 42% from three-point range. James Blackmon, Jr. and Troy Williams were the leading scorers, with 18.8 and 18.4 ppg.\nRecruiting class.\nIn addition to the six incoming freshmen recruits, Indiana is also adding Nick Zeisloft, a graduate transfer from Illinois State.

The event was held in the Dubai Club for the Disabled.\nThis proved to be the final event branded as the \"IPC Powerlifting World Championships\". On 30 November 2016, the International Paralympic Committee, which serves as the international federation for 10 disability sports, including powerlifting, adopted the \"World Para\" brand for all 10 sports.

Held at the Dubai Club for the Disabled, the competition was attended by more than 330 athletes representing 60 countries, surpassing the number of entrants for the 2012 Summer Paralympics held in London. Twenty lifting events were contested, with ten categories for both female and male competitors. Medals were given for first, second and third place.\nFive countries dominated the results: Nigeria, Egypt, China, Iran and Russia. These five countries took home 41 of the total 60 medals, including 14 golds. Although Egypt led the medal table from day three, Nigeria finished atop the table with five golds after Precious Orji won the final women's event, the over 86 kg category. Egypt won the most medals at the competition, with a total of 12, followed by Russia with 9.\nOver the 20 events, 15 world records were equaled or surpassed. Some events saw world records broken multiple times, including both heaviest categories. Precious Orji broke her own world record three times to eventually lift 151 kg, while in the men's event Siamand Rahman of Iran broke his own world record three times lifting 285.5 kg. In the lower weights Egypt's Sherif Othman, in the -54 kg category, surpassed the old world record of 181 kg four times, finishing with a lift of 205 kg."

The team played its home games in Lexington, Kentucky, United States for the 39th consecutive season at Rupp Arena, with a capacity of 23,500. The team was led by sixth-year head coach John Calipari. The team was a National semifinalist in the NCAA tournament, competed in the school's 17th Final Four. It was Calipari's fourth Final Four appearance at Kentucky. The team finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history. For six years, they had been the last unbeaten team to enter the NCAA tournament until Gonzaga in 2021. Their 38 wins is tied with the 2012 Kentucky team for the most in men's Division I history. Their 38–1 record (.974 winning percentage) is the best by a team that did not finish undefeated.\nAfter finishing as the National Runner-up in the 2014 NCAA tournament, the expectations for this team were high. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2013–14 team including starting power forward Julius Randle and starting small forward James Young, who were first-round draft choices in the 2014 NBA draft. Returning were starting point guard Andrew Harrison, starting shooting guard Aaron Harrison, and starting center Dakari Johnson. Former McDonald's All-Americans Marcus Lee and Alex Poythress also returned to school. Willie Cauley-Stein opted to return to school after his leg injury in the 2014 NCAA tournament. John Calipari once again produced another top recruiting class that was highlighted by Karl-Anthony Towns.\nThe Wildcats were led by 2015 Consensus All-Americans Cauley-Stein and Towns.\n2014–15 newcomers.\nIn November, Kentucky signed another top recruiting class. John Calipari announced four players for his 2014 class during the early signing period on November 14. Trey Lyles (Indianapolis), Karl-Anthony Towns (Metuchen, N.J.), Devin Booker (Grand Rapids, Mich.) and Tyler Ulis (Chicago Heights, Ill.) all signed national letters of intent to play basketball at the University of Kentucky, starting in the 2014–15 season.\nKarl-Anthony Towns was the first commitment for the class when he verbally committed on December 4, 2012.

Buffalo led by 5 at halftime, but Kentucky used a 9 to 0 run to start the second half to regain the lead. Two nights later Kentucky traveled to Indianapolis to face No. 5 Kansas in the annual Champions Classic. Kentucky defeated Kansas 72 to 40 which was Kansas' lowest number of points scored since 1962.

After a week off Kentucky traveled to Chicago to play UCLA in the inaugural CBS Sports Classic. Kentucky defeated the Bruins in dominating fashion, 83 to 44. The Wildcats were leading 24 to 0 before UCLA scored their first point with 12 minutes left in the first half. Kentucky led 41 to 7 at halftime. It was the lowest point total in a half for UCLA and the fewest by a Kentucky opponent since December 1943. After the UCLA game the team took a week off for the Holidays. Upon their return they traveled to the KFC Yum! Center for their first road test of the season against in-state rival No. 4 Louisville. Ulis had a career game, scoring career-best 14 points off the bench to defeat the Cards 58 to 50. This was Kentucky's seventh victory in eight games against Louisville with Calipari as head coach.\nJanuary.\nKentucky opened the SEC portion of their schedule on January 6 at home against Ole Miss. After looking dominant in November and December, the Cats were taken to the wire by the Rebels. UK needed overtime to outlast Ole Miss 89 to 86. Unfazed by trailing Kentucky 12 to 0 and 18 to 5, Ole Miss' Emmanuel Moody helped the Rebels regroup to mount runs of 10 to 0 and 7 to 0 to get within 23 to 22 before eventually taking a 30 to 26 lead with 7:01 left in the half. The Rebels led 38 to 36 at the break behind 50 percent shooting before Kentucky opened the second half with a spurt that put them by as many as six before Mississippi battled back. Wildcats guard Aaron Harrison thwarted the Rebels' quest by scoring 26 points, including two big free throws with 1:29 remaining in overtime to put Kentucky ahead to stay. After the scare Ole Miss put into Kentucky, they rebounded on January 10 at Texas A&amp;M behind Booker's 18 points to a 70 to 64 victory in double-overtime. The Aggies rallied in the final minutes to tie it in regulation. Lyles made two foul shots with six seconds left in the first overtime for Kentucky, and Texas A&amp;M took its time before missing a long 3 at the buzzer. Down 66 to 63, Texas A&amp;M's Kourtney Roberson made one of two free throws before a turnover by Lyles gave the Aggies the ball back with 26.9 seconds left. A&amp;M's Danuel House missed a 3-pointer with 16 seconds left and Kentucky's Johnson made two free throws to seal the game. Kentucky returned home on January 13 to defeat Missouri 86 to 37. Aaron Harrison scored 16 points including five 3-pointers to lift Kentucky to their first SEC win in regulation. Cauley-Stein added 13 points and Towns 12 points with 10 rebounds as Kentucky shot 48 percent from the field. The Wildcats also held Missouri to a season-low 27 percent and outrebounded the Tigers 46 to 27 including 30 defensive boards.\n On January 17 Kentucky traveled to Tuscaloosa to defeat Alabama 70 to 48. Kentucky used two big runs to take a 35 to 17 lead by halftime. Alabama trimmed the lead in half with a 13–4 run coming out of the locker room, when the Wildcats missed their first five shots. The rally was short-lived, and then it got worse for the Tide. The Wildcats reclaimed control with 10 straight points en route to a 16–2 run that featured two 3-pointers by Ulis, one by Booker and a powerful dunk by Cauley-Stein. Freshman Devin Booker scored 13 points and remained solid from the perimeter. On January 20 Kentucky defeated Vanderbilt 65 to 57 at Rupp Arena. The Wildcats didn't lead by double digits until early in the second half, and that 45 to 33 advantage lasted briefly as the Commodores began answering from the perimeter to stay within reach. Five combined 3-pointers by Vanderbilt's Riley LaChance (16 points) and Matthew Fisher-Davis (13) helped Vanderbilt pull within 58 to 54 with 2:36 left. The Commodores never got closer as the Harrisons closed it out for the Wildcats. On January 24 Kentucky traveled to Columbia to defeat South Carolina 58 to 43. In the season prior, Kentucky lost 72 to 67 on this same floor only weeks before their run to the National Championship game. However, the Wildcats turned up the defense to make sure that didn't happen this time after South Carolina's Sindarius Thornwell hit a 3-pointer for a 24 to 23 South Carolina lead with 4:31 left that sent the fans into a frenzy. Ulis started the comeback for Kentucky with a steal and basket before Booker made two fouls shots and a dunk and the Wildcats were on their way. Booker scored seven points in Kentucky's 14 to 0 run that spanned both halves, closing the surge with a 3-pointer that put the Wildcats ahead 37 to 24 with 18:28 remaining. On January 29 the Wildcats again traveled to Columbia, this time to defeat Missouri 69 to 53. The Tigers looked game for most of the first half. Milking the clock with crisp ball movement, Missouri was able to crack Kentucky's long and lean front line for easy baskets. Missouri's Keanau Post started it with a rim-rattling dunk a few minutes in, and a pair of dunks by Ryan Rosburg had the fans in Mizzou Arena on their feet. Another dunk by Jakeenan Gant late in the half allowed the Tigers to close within 32 to 25. The Wildcats struggled some more early in the second half, throwing up a series of ugly jumpers and missing a couple shots at the rim. Missouri struggled to take advantage, but did close within 38 to 32 on Clark's basket with 14:25 to go. Foul trouble began to set in, though, with Missouri's Namon Wright and Montaque Gill-Caesar each picking up their fourth with more than 15 minutes left in the game. The Wildcats, with more quality depth, were able to capitalize on their absences and put together a 10 to 2 run to gain control. The Harrison twins led the way. Aaron knocked down a jumper, and after Andrew did the same, he proceeded to the foul line on the next four trips down the floor. Wright fouled out with 8:52 to go. Gill-Caesar joined him less than a minute later. And by the time the Wildcats had hit those free throws, their lead had swelled to 56 to 36. On January 30 Kentucky faced off against Alabama for the second time this season at Rupp Arena, defeating the Crimson Tide 70 to 55. Towns scored all 12 of his points in the first half to put Kentucky ahead. Cauley-Stein snapped out of a mini-slump with 12 points and four rebounds, Booker added 11 points with three 3-pointers and Aaron Harrison had 10. Kentucky quickly rolled to a double-digit lead and positioned itself to blow out Alabama before settling for a 37 to 24 advantage at the break. Kentucky controlled the paint 28 to 14 while their bench dominated the Tide 31 to 8. Kentucky also committed just five turnovers while forcing Alabama into 13 mistakes that resulted in 20 points.\nFebruary.\nOn February 3 Kentucky hosted Georgia at Rupp Arena, defeating the Bulldogs 69 to 58. The Bulldogs were without leading scorer and rebounder Marcus Thornton, who was out due to a concussion. Andrew Harrison scored 23 points and combined with Towns for key baskets down the stretch that helped Kentucky pull away. Harrison's layup with 3:58 remaining provided a 62 to 54 lead before baskets by Georgia's Yante Maten and Nemanja Djurisic pulled the Bulldogs to 63 to 58 with 2:06 left. Towns' short jumper with 1:33 left got the lead to seven, and Tyler Ulis and Harrison each added two free throws in the final minute for the Wildcats. On February 7 Kentucky traveled to Gainesville to face arch-rival Florida. Florida swept all three meetings in 2014, winning in Lexington, in Gainesville and in the SEC tournament. Both teams advanced to the Final Four in 2014, but had gone in different directions in 2015. Florida entered the game one game over .500 and struggling mightily through the beginning of SEC play. Aaron Harrison scored 23 points, Towns added 19 and the Wildcats remained unbeaten with a 68 to 61 victory over the Gators before a national television audience on ESPN's College GameDay. Florida led by nine in the first half and used a 6 to 0 run to go up 44 to 42 midway through the second half. However, Cauley-Stein's dunk proved to be the turning point. Florida's Devon Robinson turned the ball over on one end, and Cauley-Stein was the beneficiary on the other. He caught a pass in transition near the foul line, took two steps and then slammed it over Robinson. He was fouled on the play and made the free throw to put Kentucky ahead for good. Free throws were huge down the stretch, too. Kentucky closed out the game from the charity stripe and finished 21 of 22 from there. On February 9 traveled to Baton Rouge face LSU before another national television audience on ESPN. Frustrated by the way his team was playing, coach Calipari told them he hoped they'd lose. They almost did. Towns redeemed himself after drawing a technical foul for hanging on the basket and the ire of his coach by hitting a go-head jump hook with 1:30 left and grabbing a clutch offensive rebound against LSU in the final minute to help Kentucky stay unbeaten, defeating the Tigers 71 to 69. Calipari explained that he wanted to make sure his team won't lose elimination games in March over senseless fouls, so even as his assistants pleaded with him to call timeout, he just watched and joined in the ear-ringing frenzy at the sold out Pete Maravich Assembly Center during a stunning 21 to 2 LSU run that gave the Tigers a 66 to 60 lead. LSU's Keith Hornsby had a shot to win it for LSU in the final seconds, but his off-balance 3 bounced off the outside of the rim, and Kentucky was victorious. On February 14 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against South Carolina for the second time this season. After holding South Carolina to 27 percent shooting in last month's meeting, Kentucky limited the Gamecocks to just 13 of 55 from the field (24 percent) this time. Kentucky had a strong start that put South Carolina in a hole that steadily deepened. The Wildcats led 26 to 6 with 8:21 left in the first half and never eased off in overwhelming South Carolina on both ends. It was 43 to 18 at halftime, and Kentucky poured it on against a Gamecocks squad looking to build off a five-point win over Missouri. On February 17 Kentucky traveled to Knoxville to face arch-rival Tennessee. Booker had 18 points and seven rebounds as Kentucky picked up its defense in the second half and pulled away for a 66 to 48 victory over the Volunteers. The victory set a new record for the historic program as they became 26–0 for the first time, though the Wildcats finished the 1953–54 season with a 25–0 mark. On February 21 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to defeat Auburn 110 to 75. Towns scored 19 points to lead six Kentucky players in double figures. The Wildcats recorded their highest scoring total since 2002 in the blowout win over the Tigers. The victory also extended their best start ever and equaled the 1995–96 squad's school-record 27-game winning streak. At halftime Kentucky hoisted legendary player Tony Delk's #00 jersey in the rafters. On February 25 Kentucky traveled to Starkville to face Mississippi State. Kentucky looked slightly mortal for most of the first half, letting a 14-point lead evaporate to 33 to 27. Ulis hit a 3-pointer just before the halftime buzzer to push the Wildcats' advantage to 36 to 27. They had a few more careless defensive moments early in the second half, which helped Mississippi State briefly make things interesting. Mississippi State's Craig Sword's pass to a wide-open Roquez Johnson led to an easy layup, pulling the Bulldogs within 41 to 37 with 15 minutes remaining. Kentucky responded with the next six points by pounding the ball into the paint and using its significant size advantage to pull away for the win. Lyles scored 18 points, and Kentucky was victorious 74 to 56. On February 28 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face off against nationally ranked Arkansas. The Razorbacks entered the game ranked No. 16/18 in the AP and USA Today Coaches polls. This was the first ranked opponent since they defeated Louisville in late December. Arkansas also entered the game on a three-game win streak over Kentucky. The Wildcats seized the tempo from the start with a quick pace that knocked the Razorbacks on their heels. Lyles started things off with a lob dunk from Towns (eight points, five rebounds), who followed with a putback basket. Aaron Harrison (nine points, seven rebounds) soon added a 3-pointer to get a sellout crowd into the game, and Kentucky had plenty more in an energetic if chippy first half by both teams. Arkansas went 0 for 9 from long range and shot 30 percent overall while getting outrebounded 24 to 18 through 20 minutes as Kentucky built a 42 to 26 halftime lead. At one point in the second half the lead swelled to 31 points. The Wildcats clinched the Southeastern Conference regular-season title defeating the Razorbacks 84 to 67.\nMarch.\nOn March 2 Kentucky traveled to Athens to for its second meeting with Georgia. Facing the largest second-half deficit of its so-far perfect season, Kentucky clamped down defensively, ripped off a 14 to 0 run and defeat Georgia 72 to 64. Georgia's Yante Maten tipped in a miss of his own shot on the second attempt to put the Bulldogs up 56 to 47 with just over 9 minutes remaining. Towns and Aaron Harrison were huge down the stretch, combining for 12 of the 14 points during the decisive run. Towns had seven, including a three-point play with 2:53 left that put Kentucky ahead to stay. Harrison chipped in with five, and Cauley-Stein came up with a huge dunk off a missed free throw to give the Wildcats a four-point play on one possession. On March 7 Kentucky returned to Rupp Arena to face Florida on senior night in the regular season finale. Kentucky embraced its milestone following the 67 to 50 victory over the Gators. The Wildcats gathered at midcourt and donned their blue T-shirts with \"31-0 Not Done Yet\" in white. Kentucky became the first team from a Power 5 conference to achieve a perfect record during the regular season in over twenty-five years.\nSEC tournament.\nKentucky entered the 2015 SEC tournament as the top-overall seed and bye until the quarterfinals. The SEC tournament took place at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. On March 13 Kentucky met Florida for the third time of the season with the right to go to the semifinals of the SEC tournament. In the day prior, Florida defeated Alabama in the second round to advance to the quarterfinals. Aaron Harrison and Towns each scored 13 points and Kentucky shut down Florida in the second half to pull away for a 64 to 49 victory. The height advantage helped Kentucky outrebound Florida 39 to 33, including a 16 to 11 edge offensively that created extra chances and earned frequent trips to the free-throw line. Towns also had 12 boards. On March 14 Kentucky met Auburn in the semifinals of the SEC tournament. In the day prior, Auburn upset LSU in overtime. Kentucky poured it on against an Auburn squad that lost two players in less than 24 hours. Auburn forward Jordon Granger was suspended for fighting in Friday's quarterfinal win over LSU, and the school announced just before the tipoff that forward Cinmeon Bowers had been suspended for a potential rules violation. Cauley-Stein scored 18 points and Andrew Harrison added 15 to help Kentucky improve to 33–0 in a 91 to 67 victory over the Tigers and advance to the finals of the SEC tournament. The win broke the school-record winning streak of 32 games set from December 5, 1953, to January 8, 1955. On March 15 Kentucky met Arkansas in the finals of the SEC tournament. The Razorbacks defeated Georgia in the semifinals the day prior. Cauley-Stein scored 15 points and grabbed 10 rebounds, and Kentucky never trailed in beating No. 21 Arkansas 78 to 63 for the program's 28th SEC tournament title. Kentucky scored the first eight points as Andrew Harrison hit two 3s early. Arkansas had not trailed in this tournament, yet against Kentucky the best the Razorbacks could do was tie the game four times with the last at 19-all on a 3-pointer by Qualls with 7:59 left. By the time the Razorbacks worked the ball inside against Kentucky's blue wall, they struggled to knock down shots. After Qualls' 3, they didn't score another field goal the rest of the half. Kentucky scored seven straight as part of a 16–4 run to finish the half with a 41 to 25 lead.\nNCAA tournament.\nKentucky entered the NCAA tournament as the number one overall seed in the Midwest region. The top four seeds within the region included Kentucky, Kansas, Notre Dame, and Maryland. The semifinals and finals of the region were held in Cleveland.\nRound of 64.\nOn Selection Sunday it was announced that Kentucky would play its opening round games in Louisville at the KFC Yum! Center against the winner of a play-in game between Hampton and Manhattan. Hampton defeated Manhattan 74 to 64 on March 17. On March 20 Kentucky played Hampton, and defeated the Pirates 79 to 56. Towns bounced back from a mini-slump with 21 points and 11 rebounds, Andrew Harrison added 14 points and the Wildcats rolled to an opening game victory.\nRound of 32.\nOn March 20 8th-seeded Cincinnati and 9th-seeded Purdue squared off in the game prior to Kentucky and Hampton playing. The Bearcats outlasted the Boilermakers 66 to 65 in overtime. On March 22 Cincinnati and Kentucky met in Louisville for a berth to the Sweet 16. This was the first meeting between the two programs since the 2005 NCAA tournament in which Kentucky won. The game was not as easy for the Wildcats like it was in the opening round game against Hampton. Kentucky shot just 37 percent and was outrebounded 45 to 38 yet always seemed in control because of timely baskets and rebounds that Cincinnati failed to get. The physical, pesky Bearcats made the Wildcats work hard for every shot and rebound in an intense contest. Yet the Wildcats succeeded by making life difficult on both ends for Cincinnati, holding the Bearcats to 32 percent shooting including just 24 percent in the second half. Kentucky blocked six shots after halftime and nine overall while also coming up with key rebounds. Kentucky outlasted Cincinnati's physicality, defeating the Bearcats 64 to 51 en route to the Sweet 16.\nMidwest Regional semifinals.\nOn March 21 4th-seeded Maryland faced off against 5th-seeded West Virginia. The Mountaineers defeated the Terrapins 69 to 59 to set up a match-up against Kentucky in the Sweet 16 in Cleveland. Prior to the game on March 26, West Virginia guard Daxter Miles Jr. guaranteed that the Mountaineers would hand the Wildcats their first loss of the season, claiming the Wildcats were going to be 36–1. The comment by Miles made ESPN's SportsCenter prior to the game and created a lot of commentary prior to the game about the Mountaineers chances against the Wildcats. The commentary by the West Virginia player only fueled the Kentucky players. Within the first eight minutes, Kentucky built an 18 to 2 lead. Rendering West Virginia's full-court pressure wholly ineffective, UK committed just 10 turnovers for the game and shot a scalding 60.9 percent from the field in building an insurmountable 44 to 18 lead. The Mountaineers, meanwhile, were flummoxed on offense. They shot 24.1 percent from the field for the game and at one point had made just 5-of-37 attempts. All told, they managed just 0.582 points per possession and their 39 points were a season low. UK, meanwhile, blocked seven shots. Six players combined for UK's 13 assists on 24 made field goals, while more good passes helped lead to the Cats' 31 free-throw attempts, of which they hit 26. Trey Lyles hit 6-of-7 tries from the line in pacing UK with 14 points, while Andrew Harrison scored nine of his 13 points at the line. Kentucky defeated West Virginia 78 to 39, tying the largest margin of victory ever in a regional semifinal.\nMidwest Regional Finals.\nOn March 26 3rd-seeded Notre Dame faced off against Wichita State for a berth to the Elite Eight. Notre Dame defeated Wichita State 81 to 70 to set up a meeting with Kentucky two nights later. On March 28 Kentucky and Notre Dame met for a berth to the Final Four. In a game that was considered one of the greatest in NCAA tournament history, Kentucky defeated Notre Dame 68 to 66. Kentucky needed its players to step up in a big game with such high stakes. Towns was foremost among players stepping up when it mattered most. The 6-foot-11 forward played through foul trouble to score nine of his career-best 25 points over that final stretch, including the game-tying basket in the post with 1:12 left. The big 3 came with 3:15 on the clock. The Cats, in the midst of a rally after previously trailing by six points with 6:14 to go, trailed by just two when Aaron Harrison pulled up from the right wing. With six seconds left in an Elite Eight matchup with Notre Dame, Andrew Harrison drove and drew a foul on Notre Dame's Demetrius Jackson. Following a timeout called by the Fighting Irish, he toed the line in a 66–66 game and sank two free throws to give Kentucky a 68 to 66 lead. The margin remained intact as Notre Dame's Jerian Grant missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired. The game between Kentucky and Notre Dame was the highest rated college basketball game on cable of all time.\nNational semifinal.\nOn March 26 1-seeded Wisconsin defeated 2-seeded Arizona 85 to 78 for a berth to the Final Four. This set up a re-match between Kentucky and Wisconsin at the Final Four, this time in Indianapolis. On April 4 Kentucky and Wisconsin faced off for a berth to the National Championship game against Duke. The Wildcats, once trailing by nine points in the first half and eight early in the second, were poised to close out another opponent in the final minutes, this time in the Final Four. With an 8 to 0 run and their defense holding Wisconsin scoreless for more than six minutes, the Cats grabbed a 60–56 lead with less than five minutes remaining. The Badgers reeled off an 8 to 0 run of their own that Sam Dekker started. Next, Nigel Hayes tied the game with a put-back. It was the last of Wisconsin's 12 offensive rebounds and 13 second-chance points. The Badgers' 71–64 upset victory increased the perfect season drought to 39 years.\nResults.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#005DAA; color:white;\"| SEC regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"text-align: center; background:#005DAA\"|SEC tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"text-align: center; background:#005DAA\"|NCAA tournament\nStatistics.\nThe team posted the following statistics:\nHonors.\nWatch lists.\nWillie Cauley-Stein and Karl-Anthony Towns were two of four SEC players (with Jordan Mickey and Bobby Portis) named to the 30-man Naismith College Player of the Year midseason watchlist.

        "title": "Connor Brown (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Connor Brown (born January 14, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger for the Edmonton Oilers of the National Hockey League (NHL). Brown was selected by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the sixth round, 156th overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft. Brown played for the Erie Otters in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) from 2011 until 2014, then for the American Hockey League (AHL)'s Toronto Marlies for the better part of two seasons before joining the Toronto Maple Leafs full-time in the 2016–17 season. He played for two more years with Toronto before he was traded to the Ottawa Senators in 2019. Brown spent three seasons with the Senators where he was an alternate captain. He was traded to the Washington Capitals heading into the 2022–23 NHL season.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nBrown grew up playing youth hockey in the Toronto area. He played first for the West Mall Lightning mite select team, in the North York Hockey League, where his father was the head coach. The Lightning team later morphed in the GTHL Toronto Marlboros team for players born in 1994. The core of the team won ten-straight city championships and included seven players who would go on to be selected at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft: Brown, Scott Laughton, Matt Finn, Adam Pelech, Scott Kosmachuk, Jake Paterson and Matia Marcantuoni.\nBrown was selected in the 13th round, 251st overall, by the Ontario Hockey League (OHL)'s Erie Otters in the 2010 OHL Priority Draft. He spent the 2010–11 season playing Junior \"A\" hockey for the St. Michael's Buzzers in the Ontario Junior Hockey League (OJHL).\nBrown joined the Otters for the 2011–12 season and led the team in points (53), goals (25) and assists (28), and was named to the OHL's All-Rookie Team. However, he recorded a plus-minus of –72, a jarring statistic that was also the worst plus-minus of any player in the OHL (second-worst was teammate Kris Grant with –61). The plus-minus was primarily a result of an Otters team that finished last in the OHL, resulting in the franchise drafting first overall in the OHL draft and selecting future NHL star Connor McDavid. Brown entered the 2012 NHL Entry Draft and was selected in the sixth round, 156th overall, by his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs. Brown's offensive talent lead the Maple Leafs to select him, but his small stature and historically bad plus-minus caused the pick to be called a \"gamble\".\nBrown returned to the Otters for the 2012–13 season, serving as the captain of the team.\nBrown spent the 2013–14 season on a line with Connor McDavid, scoring 45 goals and 83 assists for 128 points in 68 games. He went on to score 8 goals and 10 assists in 14 games during the playoffs to cap off what was the best season in the team's history. Brown was awarded both the Jim Mahon Memorial Trophy as the OHL's top scoring right winger, and the Eddie Powers Memorial Trophy as the top scoring player in the OHL. At the time of his departure, he held the Otters franchise record for most points in a single season; his record has since been passed by former line-mate Dylan Strome, who surpassed it by one point the following season.\nProfessional.\nToronto Maple Leafs.\nOn November 22, 2013, Brown signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Maple Leafs. In his first year with the Maple Leafs' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, he won the AHL rookie scoring title, finishing the regular season with 21 goals and 40 assists. Brown played for the Marlies until his call-up to the Maple Leafs in March 2016.\nBrown almost made the Maple Leafs' NHL roster out of training camp for the 2015–16 season, but was assigned to the AHL to further his development. However, he would be called up to the team late in the season as part of an initiative by the team to give AHL rookies some late season experience. Brown made his NHL debut on March 17, 2016, against the Florida Panthers, and scored his first NHL goal on March 24 against future teammate Frederik Andersen of the Anaheim Ducks.\nBrown made the Maple Leafs full-time for the 2016–17 season. However, a deep presence of forward depth meant Brown was playing on the fourth line with Matt Martin, though he saw time on the penalty kill. After five games in a limited role, Maple Leafs veteran forward Milan Michálek was placed on waivers in order to make room and give Brown a larger role on the team. Former Maple Leaf Ben Smith rejoined the team via waivers in order to take Brown's former spot. Brown played the rest of the year mostly on a line with Nazem Kadri and Leo Komarov, collecting 20 goals and compiling 36 points.\nOn August 26, 2017, as a restricted free agent, Brown signed a new three-year, $6.3 million contract with Toronto worth $2.1 million annually. During the season, Brown scored 8 goals and 29 points in 82 games.\nOttawa Senators.\nOn July 1, 2019, Brown was traded (along with Nikita Zaitsev and Michael Carcone) to the Ottawa Senators in exchange for Cody Ceci, Ben Harpur, Aaron Luchuk and a third-round pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft. In Ottawa, Brown saw an expanded role after falling down the depth chart in Toronto. He made his debut for the Senators on opening day of the season versus Toronto. He finished the season second on the team in scoring, with 16 goals and 43 points.\nOn October 22, 2020, Brown re-signed as a restricted free agent with the Ottawa Senators, for three years at an average annual value of $3.6 million. During the season, Brown set the Senators franchise record for consecutive games with a goal with seven, set on April 10, 2021. On April 20, 2021, Brown scored two goals in a 4–2 win over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 21 goals in 56 games. During the season, Brown scored only 10 goals and 39 points in 64 games.\nWashington Capitals.\nFollowing his third season with the Senators, Brown was traded on the opening day of free agency on July 13, 2022, to the Washington Capitals in exchange for a second-round draft pick in 2024. After only playing four games with the Capitals in the season, Brown suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury which required surgery. Capitals coach Peter Laviolette announced Brown would likely miss the rest of the year.\nEdmonton Oilers.\nAs a free agent at the conclusion of his contract with the Capitals, Brown was signed to an incentive laden one-year, $4 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers for the season on July 1, 2023.\nPersonal life.\nBrown became engaged to his long-time girlfriend in January 2020. They married in August 2021. Brown and his wife have one child."

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup, sometimes called the Football World Cup, but usually referred to simply as the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946 due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nSwitzerland have appeared in the finals of the World Cup on twelve occasions. They have reached the quarter-finals three times, in 1934, 1938 and 1954.\nWorld Cup record.\nSwitzerland's record at FIFA World Cups:\nMatch records.\n1934 FIFA World Cup.\nThe group stage used in the first World Cup was discarded in favour of a straight knockout tournament.\n1954 FIFA World Cup.\nSwitzerland hosted the tournament in 1954 and reached the quarter-final for a third time, where the team was beaten 7–5 by neighbouring Austria.\n1962 FIFA World Cup.\nAfter missing out on the previous tournament, Switzerland qualified for the 1962 edition, held in Chile. Unfortunately, they finished at the bottom of Group 2 without a single point, having lost all their matches.\n1966 FIFA World Cup.\nDespite securing back-to-back qualification for the FIFA World Cups, Switzerland's performance in the 1966 edition was far more abysmal. They lost all of their matches once more, including a 5-0 walloping by eventual runners-up West Germany in their opening game. To date, this remains as Switzerland's worst performance.\nThis was also Switzerland's last FIFA World Cup campaign in 28 years, as their next appearance at the tournament would come in the 1994 edition.\n1994 FIFA World Cup.\nNote: Switzerland's fourth goal is also credited to Georges Bregy.\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nThe World Cup 2006 in Germany was the first World Cup for Switzerland since their participation at the World Cup 1994. After finishing second behind France in qualifying group 4, they defeated Turkey in the play-off round 2–0 and 4–2 to qualify for the main tournament.\nIn the group stage, they played again against France. The game played in Stuttgart ended in a goalless draw. After defeating Togo 2–0 in Dortmund and South Korea also 2–0 in Hannover, they finished first in group G and qualified for the knockout stage. In the second round of the tournament, they faced Ukraine in Cologne. The game had to be decided in a penalty shootout since no goal was scored after 120 minutes. Ukraine won the shootout 3–0. Switzerland was the only team in tournament not to have conceded a goal during regulation time in their matches. Switzerland's top scorer at the tournament was Alexander Frei with two goals. When Switzerland lost 3–0 on penalties, that was the first time that a team lost on penalties without scoring a single goal in the penalties.\n\"All times local (CEST/UTC+2)\"\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nSwitzerland were the only team to beat eventual world champion Spain, by a 0–1 victory in the group stage. In spite of this, they did not survive the first round.\n2014 FIFA World Cup.\nAt the 2014 FIFA World Cup, Switzerland were drawn in Group E along with Ecuador, France, and Honduras. They opened their campaign with a 2–1 victory over Ecuador in Brasilia. However, in their next match, they suffered a 5–2 defeat to France. Despite the initial setback, a 3–0 victory in their final game against Honduras, courtesy of a hat-trick by Xherdan Shaqiri sent them into the round of 16, where they faced the two-time world champions and eventual runners-up Argentina.\nThe game was goalless and nearly heading to penalties when Ángel Di María scored a 118th-minute extra time goal to send Argentina into the quarter-finals. Despite being eliminated in the round of 16, it was Switzerland's best performance in eight years.\n\"All times local: five matches are in Brasília official time (), while Honduras v Switzerland, played in Manaus, is in the Amazon time zone ().\"\nTop goalscorers.\nWith six goals at Switzerland's home tournament in 1954, Josef Hügi won the shared Silver Boot - the only individual FIFA World Cup award ever received by a Swiss player."

It was inaugurated on 4 June 1928, and it took a long time until a second indoor pool was opened in Finland. The pool is located in the Kamppi area of Helsinki at Yrjönkatu 21b, and is owned by the city of Helsinki.\nThe hall building was designed by architect Väinö Vähäkallio and represents the Nordic Classicism style. It was inspired by the Centralbadet swimming hall in Stockholm. The hall was originally privately owned, but was transferred to the Finnish Sports Federation in 1954 and to the city of Helsinki in 1967. The hall was renovated from 1997 to 1999.\nThe Yrjönkatu Swimming Hall's first floor contains a 25 × 10 metre pool, two saunas and dressing closets at the edges of the pool. The second floor contains resting cabins, saunas and a café. The hall sells two kinds of tickets, providing access either to the first floor only or to both floors. Traditionally, people swam naked in the pool, but since 2001, the wearing of a swimsuit has been permitted. Men and women have separate days for swimming. In March 2012, the hall reported it was switching its original 1928 wooden sauna stove to a new one to cut down on the smoke damages to the Forum building. The new wooden sauna stove became operational in August 2013. It is 2.8 metres high and is thought to be one of the largest wooden sauna stoves in Finland."

        "text": "Christopher Charles Samuel Hill is a veteran tennis player and professional tennis coach based in South Wales.\nPersonal life.\nBorn in 1957 in Abertillery, Monmouthshire, Hill still lived in the area as of 2015. Hill is a strong advocate of tennis and the personal, social and sporting benefits associated with the game.\nPlaying career.\nHill started tennis at a very early age at his local “Six Bells” tennis club and was trained by Bob Wallace, the former Secretary of the Welsh Lawn Tennis Association (LTA).\nHis playing career continued in much the same vein through senior tournaments. He was a multiple Welsh Doubles Championship finalist, a Wales international player and captained his county side.\nBy 2015 he had been a Wimbledon Champion and achieved over 75 Wales and Great Britain title wins.\nCoaching career.\nHill’s first venture into coaching came at just 16. It continued for more than 30 years on a part-time basis alongside full-time employment in the steel industry. Redundancy gave him the freedom to take up professional coaching. \nIn 2011, Hill was shortlisted by “Tennis Wales” for Welsh Tennis Coach of the year. That same year he coached Special Olympics tennis player Shain Lewis who went on to win two bronze medals at Athens. Lewis was selected from the competing 6000 athletes to give the closing ceremony speech."

        "title": "2018–19 UEFA Nations League",
        "text": "The 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was the inaugural season of the UEFA Nations League, an international association football competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of UEFA. The league phase of the competition was played between September and November 2018, with the finals tournament for the group winners from League A taking place in Portugal in June 2019. Team performances in the league phase were used to seed teams for the qualifying group stage of UEFA Euro 2020, and awarded berths in the play-offs, which decided four of the twenty-four final tournament slots.\nFormat.\nThe format and schedule of the UEFA Nations League was formally approved by the UEFA Executive Committee on 4 December 2014. According to the approved format, the 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four divisions (called \"leagues\"): 12 teams in League A, 12 teams in League B, 15 teams in League C, and 16 teams in League D. For the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League, teams were divided according to their UEFA national team coefficients after the conclusion of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers (play-off results were not included), with the highest-ranked teams playing in League A, etc.\nEach league was divided into four groups of three or four teams, so each team played four or six matches within their group (using the home-and-away round-robin format), on double matchdays in September, October and November 2018.\nIn the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals in June 2019, which was played in a knockout format, consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off, and final. The semi-final pairings, along with the administrative home teams for the third place play-off and final, were determined by means of an open draw on 3 December 2018. Host country Portugal was selected among the four qualified teams on 3 December 2018 by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions.\nTeams also competed for promotion and relegation to a higher or lower league. In each league, the four group winners (except League A) were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group (except League D) were initially to be relegated; the exception was in League C, where due to different-sized groups, the three fourth-placed teams and the lowest-ranking third-placed team were initially to be relegated. However, due to a revamp of the format for the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, no teams were eventually relegated, and some second-placed and third-placed teams were also promoted.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:\nTo determine the worst third-placed team in League C, the results against the teams in fourth place were discarded. The following criteria were applied:\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings were established according to the following criteria:\nIn order to rank teams in leagues composed of different-sized groups, the following procedure is applied:\nThe ranking of the top four teams in League A was determined by their finish in the Nations League Finals (first to fourth).\nCriteria for overall ranking.\nFor the purposes of the European Championship qualifying group stage draw and the European qualifying play-offs, overall UEFA Nations League rankings were established as follows:\nUEFA Euro 2020 qualifying.\nThe 2018–19 UEFA Nations League was linked with UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying, providing teams another chance to qualify for UEFA Euro 2020.\nThe main qualifying process began in March 2019 instead of immediately in September 2018 following the 2018 FIFA World Cup and ended in November 2019. The format remained largely the same, although only 20 of the 24 spots for the finals tournament were decided from the main qualifying process, leaving four spots still to be decided. The 55 teams were drawn into 10 groups after the completion of the UEFA Nations League (five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams, with the four UEFA Nations League Finals participants guaranteed to be drawn into groups of five teams), with the top two teams in each group qualifying. The draw seeding was based on the overall rankings of the Nations League. The qualifiers were played on double matchdays in March, June, September, October, and November 2019.\nFollowing the qualifying group stage, the qualifying play-offs took place in October and November 2020. Unlike previous editions, the participants of the play-offs were not decided based on results from the qualifying group stage. Instead, 16 teams were selected based on their performance in the Nations League. These teams were divided into four paths, each containing four teams, with one team from each path qualifying for the final tournament. Each league had its own play-off path if at least four teams were available. The Nations League group winners automatically qualified for the play-off path of their league. If a group winner had already qualified through the conventional qualifying group stage, they were replaced by the next best-ranked team in the same league. However, if there were not enough teams in the same league, then the spot would go to the next-best team in the overall ranking. However, group winners could not face teams from a higher league.\nEach play-off path featured two single-leg semi-finals and one single-leg final. The best-ranked team hosted the fourth-ranked team, and the second-ranked team hosted the third-ranked team. The host of the final was decided by a draw, with semi-final winner 1 or 2 hosting the final. The four play-off path winners joined the 20 teams which had already qualified for UEFA Euro 2020.\nSchedule.\nBelow was the schedule of the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 24 January 2018 following the draw.\nSeeding.\nAll 55 UEFA national teams were eligible to compete in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League. The 55 members at the time were divided into the four \"Leagues\" (12 teams in League A, 12 teams in League B, 15 teams in League C, and 16 teams in League D) according to their UEFA national team coefficients after the conclusion of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers (not including the play-offs), with the highest-ranked teams playing in League A, etc. The seeding pots for the draw were announced on 7 December 2017.\nThe draw for the league phase took place at the SwissTech Convention Center in Lausanne, Switzerland on 24 January 2018, 12:00 CET.\nFor political reasons, Armenia and Azerbaijan (due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict), as well as Russia and Ukraine (due to the Russian military intervention in Ukraine), could not be drawn in the same group. Due to winter venue restrictions, a group could contain a maximum of two of the following teams: Norway, Finland, Estonia, Lithuania. Due to excessive travel restrictions, only one of Andorra, Faroe Islands, or Gibraltar could be drawn with Kazakhstan, while Gibraltar could not be with Azerbaijan if they had Kazakhstan.\nOverall ranking.\nThe overall ranking after the league phase was used for seeding in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group stage draw.\nPrize money.\nThe prize money to be distributed was announced in March 2018, with a total of €76.25 million in solidarity and bonus fees due to be distributed to the 55 participating national teams. However, in October 2018, the solidarity fees and bonus payments for group winners were increased by 50%, while the bonuses for the teams appearing in the Nations League Finals also increased, resulting in a total of €112.875 million in prize money.\nThe solidarity fees per team were scaled by league:\nIn addition, the group winners of each league received the following bonus fees:\nThe four group winners of League A, which participated in the Nations League Finals, also received the following bonus fees based on performance:\nThis meant that the maximum amount of solidarity and bonus fees was €10.5 million for a team from League A, €3 million for a team from League B, €2.25 million for a team from League C, and €1.5 million for a team from League D.\nEuro 2020 qualifying play-offs.\nTeams who failed in the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying group stage could still qualify for the final tournament via the play-offs. Each league in the UEFA Nations League was allocated one of the four remaining UEFA Euro 2020 places. Four teams from each league who had not already qualified for the European Championship finals competed in the play-offs of their league, which were played in October and November 2020. The play-off berths were first allocated to each group winner, and if any of the group winners had already qualified for the European Championship finals, then to the next best ranked team of the league, etc."

It began airing on July 16, 2010 on CTS channel after \"Pandamen\".\nSynopsis.\nGrowing up together, Bai Qian Rui (Godfrey Gao) and Xin Hai Jing (Annie Chen) never saw one another as more than friends. So it's no wonder when Hai Xing called upon Qian Rui to help out the volleyball team, Qian Rui tried everything to wiggle out of it. He was more interested in romancing the beautiful Jia Kai Lin (Cindy Song) than sweating it out with his best pal. Yet, joining the team was exactly what they needed to turn their long-time friendship into something more.\nMultimedia.\nVolleyball Lover did not release any soundtrack. However, there are songs used in the series. In particular, the series had ten songs from different artists, released in their respective albums. The opening theme song used is \"My Flower\" by Freda Li while the ending theme song used is by You Xuan entitled \"I Promise You\".\nRatings.\nThe viewer ratings was conducted by AGB Nielsen."

        "title": "Denmark at the FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nThe first time Denmark entered the tournament was for the 1958 edition in Sweden. However, they lost all four of their qualifying matches to England and the Republic of Ireland.\nDenmark qualified for the first time in 1986, where they won all three of their group stage matches including a 2–0 victory against title contenders West Germany, but were eliminated by Spain in the next round. Since then, the Danish national team has regularly qualified for FIFA World Cup finals and made their sixth and most recent appearance at Qatar 2022. Their best performance was in 1998, where they reached the quarter-finals.\nFIFA World Cup match records.\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nDenmark made their first World Cup appearance in the 1986 World Cup, and with the attacking duo of Michael Laudrup and Preben Elkjær. In their first match against Scotland, Denmark won 1–0 with the only goal coming from Preben Elkjær after he burst into the penalty area before shooting left-footed low into the right corner of the net. The team surprised the world, sweeping the group, including a 6–1 thrashing of Uruguay. In the second round, Denmark faced Spain losing 5–1 on the strength of four Emilio Butragueño goals; the first Spain goal was caused by a miss-timed backpass by Jesper Olsen to Butragueño, an unfortunate action subsequently coined as \"a real Jesper Olsen\" (\"en rigtig Jesper Olsen\"). The phrase would live on for 13 years and was repeated by the Danish TV commentators in 1999, when an identical backpass was carried out by Jesper Grønkjær to Filippo Inzaghi on the former's debut for Denmark.\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nUnder coach Bo \"Bosse\" Johansson, the 1998 FIFA World Cup saw the revival of the Danish team, starring both Laudrup brothers in their last international campaign. After beating Saudi Arabia 1–0, drawing with South Africa and losing 2–1 to later champions France in mediocre games, the Danish team qualified to the knockout stages as second in the group. In the next game however, Denmark played some of the best football of the entire tournament, beating Nigeria 4–1 in a fantastic game. In the quarterfinal against Brazil, the Danes went out with a beautiful 2–3 defeat to the later silver medalists, in a very close and emotional game.\n2002 FIFA World Cup.\nDenmark qualified for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, but despite impressive results in the group stage, especially the 2–0 win against reigning World Cup winners France, Denmark didn't manage to advance any further as they were defeated with a 0–3 score in the round of 16 against England.\n\"All times local (UTC+9)\"\n2010 FIFA World Cup.\nAt the 2010 World Cup, Denmark was grouped with Japan, Cameroon and the Netherlands. Denmark lost the first match 2–0 to Netherlands, but then had a vital 2–1 victory against Cameroon, which enabled further advancement in case of victory over Japan, the final match of the group stage. Denmark, however, lost 3–1, thereby failing to reach their goal of advancing to the round of 16 for the first time.\n\"All times local (UTC+02)\"\nJapan opened the scoring in the 17th minute from a direct free kick taken by Keisuke Honda – only the second goal scored from a free kick in the tournament. Honda, standing to Danish goalkeeper Thomas Sørensen's left, kicked the ball with great force; Sørensen initially moved to his left, and as the ball sailed past the wall, he shifted direction, but could not recover in time to make the save. Japan's second goal came thirteen minutes later, also from a direct free kick, this time by Yasuhito Endō. Standing outside the penalty area directly in front of the Danish goal, he curled the ball around the wall. Sørensen had been standing on the right side of his goal and could not move to his left fast enough. Endō almost scored from yet another free kick early in the second half. This time, Sørensen appeared to have difficulty judging the path of the ball, and was only able to palm it away at the last second, where it caromed off the goalpost.\nDenmark needed to win this game in order to advance and increased their attacks accordingly. Late in the second half, Christian Eriksen put his shot over the goal and Søren Larsen hit the goalpost. They were finally able to score in the 82nd minute. When Makoto Hasebe was adjudged to have fouled Daniel Agger inside the penalty area, Denmark were awarded a penalty kick. Jon Dahl Tomasson took the shot, which was saved by Eiji Kawashima; the goalkeeper, however, was unable to control the rebound, which fell to Tomasson, and he was able to put it in the goal. Japan scored their final goal in the 87th minute. Honda dribbled into the penalty area, forcing Sørensen to attempt to block a potential shot, but Honda passed it to substitute Shinji Okazaki, who merely had to put the ball into an empty net.\nThe victory was Japan's second World Cup tournament victory on foreign soil, and only their second against a European team. Japan finished group play in second place with six points, and advanced to the knockout round for the second time in their history, and the first time on foreign soil. Denmark ended in third with three points. This was the first time Denmark failed to get past the group stage in the World Cup.\nAwards and records.\nAwards\nRecords"

        "text": "Birkenhead Park Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Birkenhead Park in the Wirral on Merseyside, England. The club was founded in 1846 and has one of the oldest cricket pavilions in the country.\nThey are currently members of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The club runs four senior Saturday teams as well as junior sides at U11, U13, U16 and U21 age groups.\nTheir 1st and 2nd XI play on the front pitch with the 3rd XI competing on the back pitch which is commonly known as Cannon Hill.\nHistory.\nThe majority of historical information included on this page is adapted from the 1996 book Birkenhead Park Cricket Club 1846-1996 by Chris Elston. The post-96 era is written by former club scorer and archivist Craig Kell.\nFormation.\nIn 1846, Birkenhead Park Cricket Club was formed on Park Drive, based in the park itself. At the time, it was a very exclusive club in which all the members were Old Boys of the top public schools. Because there were so few clubs in the area, the members arranged matches between themselves, such as married vs. singles. From the start, the ground was enclosed by railings and initially had a tent used as the pavilion. This was later followed by a wooden structure which was then replaced by the present club house that still stands to this very day.\nEarly years (19th Century).\nOne of Park's first ever fixtures came against Bootle Cricket Club though unfortunately the result is unknown. However this was to mark the beginning of their long rivalry which still continues today. 1847 saw them take on another historic opponent in Liverpool for which both teams celebrated victory in the two games played that season.\nThe following year saw Park bowled out for 18 by Liverpool which is officially their lowest ever score.\nDuring the first thirty years of their formation, Park played MCC at Lords, Surrey at the Oval and Cambridge and Oxford Universities as well as touring Ireland and Scotland. Perhaps the most significant game of that era was when they played Lancashire in 1864. Staged in Warrington, it was the Red Rose's first ever fixture and ended in a close draw. A return game was later played back in Birkenhead.\nDuring the period, Park also had two amateur players who would tour Australia with England and play one test each. They were Sandford Schultz, born in Birkenhead, and Reginald Wood, born in Woodchurch.\nIn 1877, George Dunlop scored the club's first double century as he made 201 in a fixture against Rock Ferry. The team's total of 508 is Park's highest and still stands to this day.\n1881 saw one of Park's greatest players Cecil Holden make his debut against Southport Cricket Club. Over the next fifty years, he was to dominate the club, first as a player and then as its President. He played first class cricket for Lancashire on several occasions and also represented the Liverpool &amp; District and Cheshire sides. During his prolonged Park career, he ended up compiling almost 20,000 runs and took over 650 wickets.\nOne of Holden's biggest contributions came in 1898 when he and William Barnes forged a new competition opening partnership record of 278 in a two-day evening game at Oxton.\nHolden also struck the club's second double century (202) in a home match against Northern. The hosts had been reduced to 83 for 9 when Holden and number eleven batsman C E Steen put on a club record 178 run partnership for the final wicket as Park eventually finished up on 261 all out.\n1892 brought about the formation of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition after a Liverpool newspaper began publishing a weekly table in order to create more interest in the game.\nPark were one of eleven senior clubs to make up the original table with the other teams being Bootle, Formby, Huyton, New Brighton, Northern, Ormskirk, Oxton, Rock Ferry and Sefton.\nThe century ended with the 3rd XI being formed in 1898.\nEarly 20th Century.\nThe 1900s began with the club converting the ladies pavilion into a public stand which was then later replaced by a lounge. At the time, women were not allowed into the clubhouse until the 1950s.\n1908 saw Park win the unofficial Liverpool Competition for the first time. A year later, all-rounder K D R Morrice made history for them by taking all eleven wickets in a twelve a-side match versus Western. He would also go on to make over 1000 runs in that season at an average of 61.8.\nNo cricket was played between 1915 and 1918 owing to World War I. The club had suffered great loss during that period with some members having laid down their lives for their country in active service.\nIn 1931, Park tied with local rivals Wallasey for the championship which was made possible by the acquisition of fast bowler Jack Bartley who took 67 wickets at an average of 10.37. During two spells with the club between 1931 and 1936, Bartley would take over 400 wickets for which two of those seasons would see him snare over 100 dismissals. He became the second 1st XI bowler to take all the wickets in a match as he claimed 10-37 against New Brighton in 1935.It was in that particular year that saw Park celebrate winning the championship again. It was a second title success for captain Arthur Cooke who was to take charge of the 1st XI on three separate occasions (1929-1932, 1934-1936 and 1938-1939).\nAnother standout name from that period was batsman John Rogers who amassed an incredible 1228 runs (in all competitions) at an average of 55.8 during the 1933 season. This Park record wouldn't be broken until 70 years later.\n1936 would see the club play their first friendly fixture against Tranmere Rovers F.C., a tradition that would carry on until the end of the century.\nThe following year saw Park High School student Noel Overend become a member. His involvement with Park would make a big difference many years later when he would go on to become the club's most successful captain.\nThe first recorded hat-trick from a Park bowler came from M E White who claimed three dismissals in a row in a home win against Ormskirk in 1938.\n1939 saw the cricket season overshadowed by the arrival of World War II, over twenty years since the end of the previous conflict. The pavilion was taken over by the military with various club portraits and scorebooks stored away safely. During the war, the council decided to remove the railings surrounding the ground as part of the war effort but they were never used as they contained the wrong metal content.\nPost-war period.\nFollowing the end of World War II, the president confirmed that several club members had been killed in action. They were G A Bone, E S Locke, G A Hosking, JM Kerr and H E Rogers. The pavilion had also been affected after it had sustained damage which was to be later paid off by the war damage commission.\nThe return of cricket proved frustrating for Park particularly in 1948 when they failed to win a single game all season and ended up finishing bottom of the table.\nThe following season marked the arrival of Jamaican-born wicket-keeper Clovis Roach who was to be the club's first overseas player. A key member of Noel Overend's dominant title-winning team of the 1960s, Clovis was to be a regular fixture in the 1st XI for many years and would even go on to be awarded an MBE for his work as a probation officer. He also went on to skipper the 2nd XI as well as serve two terms as club president.\nIn 1950, 56 year old Rex Bloor became captain of the 1st XI again which made him the second man after Arthur Cooke to have skippered the club on three separate occasions. That same year saw bowler Colin Tomkinson make his debut for the club. He would become the first Park player to represent the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th elevens over the course of 45 years.\nIn 1951, J R Dobie became the second 1st XI player to take a hat trick during a fixture against Hightown.\nThe following season saw M Finlay lead the 2nd XI to their first ever championship win. That year also proved a significant one for the club as Bill Edgar and the great Tony Shillinglaw made their first team debuts.\nAlong with David Hope, the three players were part of the title-winning team of 1955. Captain Alf Liggins played a pivotal role by scoring over 800 runs as Park sealed their championship triumph on the final day of the season.\nIn 1956, Bill Edgar took four wickets in four balls against St Helens Recs, the only Park player to have achieved that remarkable feat.\nAway from the cricket, the club began to improve its facilities which included the installation of flush toilets and the construction of their present scorebox. 1958 saw women finally being allowed into the clubhouse for the first time, albeit half an hour after the close of play.\nThe Noel Overend title-winning era.\n1959 saw Noel Overend take over as 1st XI captain which would lead to Park dominating the Liverpool Competition for the next few years. One key factor in that successful period was the acquisition of leg spinner Brian Jameson from Wavertree. A member of the club for seven seasons, Jameson took over 500 competition wickets which would make him one of Park's greatest ever players.1960 marked the club's first of five title wins in six years as Jameson and Shillinglaw dominated the bowling and batting performances. One of their most memorable victories that season came when Shillinglaw smashed a 52-minute century in an away success at Ormskirk.\nJameson was instrumental again with the ball during the 1961 campaign when he took 80 wickets as Park retained the title. However it was wicket-keeper Clovis Roach who took the plaudits by claiming 50 victims behind the stumps, which still remains a post-war Competition record. Elsewhere the 3rd XI triumphed in the Alderman Dawson Knock-Out Cup but they would have to wait forty years before landing their next trophy.\n1962 saw the first team clinch a third consecutive championship with 14 victories achieved during that season. Jameson claimed another 63 wickets to his name including a last over hat trick against Chester Boughton Hall. That was then followed by his season-best tally of 83 dismissals as Park made it four title triumphs on the trot in 1963.\nThe 1964 campaign was to be the most successful of that period as Park clinched the double of the championship and the John Summers Knockout Cup. Remarkably, Jameson was overshadowed by new addition Ray Digman who would take 87 wickets. Following that season, Overend retired as 1st XI captain thus bringing down the curtain on the greatest period in Birkenhead Park's cricketing history.\n1965 saw Tony Shillinglaw become the new skipper but the team's title-winning reign came to an end as they were pipped to the championship by local rivals Neston. The crucial departure of Jameson was another key blow although he could not be faulted after his significant contributions to the club in the previous few years. However one important name to make his 1st XI debut that season was Andy Hurworth who would go on to become one of the most prolific batsmen in the Liverpool Competition's history.\nIn the same year that England won the World Cup, Park managed to regain the championship with captain Shillinglaw and the Reverend Max Wigley taking over 50 wickets in the season. However the club would have to wait 20 years before becoming league champions again.\nIn the meantime, there was another cup success for Shillinglaw and his first team in 1967 as they secured the John Summers Knockout Cup for the second time in three years. The following year would see future Cheshire Cup-winning captain Ken Crofton make his 1st XI debut.\nThe silent 70s.\nFollowing a quiet end to the 1960s, Park had an inconsistent time during the 1970s. This was mostly down to their lack of success in the league although the 2nd XI celebrated two championship wins in 1971 and 1977.\nUnder Terence Steele, the first team made an excellent showing in the National Knockout Competition for which they reached the quarter-finals during the 1972 season. They achieved this even without Shillinglaw who had opted to play for Sefton Park, the only year he was away from the club.\nHowever he would come back the following season as captain and would produce the best bowling performance of his career in a memorable win at Neston. He became only the third Park bowler to take all the wickets in a game as he finished with extraordinary figures of 10-28.\n1974 saw Bill Stott repeat Shillinglaw's remarkable feat as he took all ten wickets for the second team in a game against Ormskirk. That same year also saw bowler John Carpenter take a hat trick for the first team against Wallasey.\nIn 1975, Park reached their first Cheshire Cup final but lost by four wickets to Brooklands.\nTwo years later, future 1st XI captain and club president Dave Turner led the Under 21s to victory in the H S Brown Cheshire Cup.\nThe decade ended with Andy Hurworth leading the first team to their only 20/20 cup success as they defeated Odyssey in the final of the Liverpool Echo Knockout. However they were pipped to the championship title by Southport.\nSuccess in the 80s.\n1980 marked a 1st XI debut for young batsman Ian Platt who would go on to become a regular fixture in the Park team over the next thirty years.\nSix seasons after their first Cheshire Cup final appearance, it was second time lucky for Park as Ken Crofton led to them to an eight wicket win over local rivals New Brighton. One of the standout players in that game was left arm spinner Ian McCormick who claimed three dismissals. He and his brother Stuart McCormick were to play a pivotal role for Park during the next two decades.\nIn 1984, the first team reached their third Cheshire Cup final but lost out to Elworth in what was Hurworth's second spell as skipper. Almost twenty years after leading the 1st XI to title success, Tony Shillinglaw managed to repeat the feat with the second eleven as they sealed their fourth title win.\n1986 proved to be one of the most successful seasons in Birkenhead Park's history as their first and second teams won their respective league championships. Under captain Peter Carlton, the 1st XI had clinched the title with a month of the season to play with key performances coming from the likes of Shillinglaw, Andy Hurworth, Graham Steele, Adrian Cairns and the McCormick brothers. Another individual to play a significant role was West Indian all-rounder George Codrington who was Park's first overseas signing in many years. Dave Turner's stern captaincy had been vital in helping the 2nd XI to their league triumph for which they would repeat the feat a year later.\nHowever the 1st XI were unable to do the double as they suffered their third Cheshire Cup final defeat at the hands of Cheadle. This was then followed by another failure the year after when they lost their last three wickets for two runs in a one-run loss to Stalybridge.\n1988 saw Dave Turner promoted from 2nd to 1st XI captain but Park initially struggled to get some momentum going. However some key performances from bowler Andy Cross helped them win eight of their last nine games as Park snatched the championship title by one point. Despairingly though, they slumped to their third consecutive Cheshire Cup final loss when they suffered an eight wicket defeat to local rivals Oxton.\nEnd of the 20th Century.\nThe 90s began with the club making plans to build an indoor cricket school, as envisioned by Tony Shillinglaw many years earlier. The school, commonly referred to as the nets, was eventually finished in 1993 and was officially opened by the former West Indies and Lancashire captain Clive Lloyd. There was also a new cricket square erected on the section of the Park known as Cannon Hill, based between the clubhouse and neighbours Birkenhead St Marys. This would finally lead to the formation of the fourth team.\nIn 1991, left-arm spinner and captain Gareth Evans led Park to a thrilling one wicket win over Neston in the final of the Kidson Impey Knockout Cup. By then, young players like future skipper Chris Foran and batsman Ian Cooper were starting to break into the team and would make significant contributions over the next two decades.\nTwo years later, former skipper Dave Turner had the unique fortune of taking hat-tricks in consecutive games against St Helens Recs in the league and then Rainford in the Liverpool Echo Knockout.\nAnother remarkable performance from that decade came from Alistair Cairns, son of former 1st XI player Adrian. His incredible spell of 8 overs, 7 maidens, 1 run, 1 wicket helped the second team clinch the Second Eleven Knockout Cup with victory over Bootle.\n1996 marked the 150th anniversary of Birkenhead Park Cricket Club's existence as the 1st XI pulled off their second Cheshire Cup triumph by beating the holders Poynton by two runs in a thrilling final. Having restricted Park to an underwhelming 112 for 8, Poynton ended up collapsing from 52-0 to 110 all out with the final wicket coming via a run out from Dave Williams. However, Gareth Evans' team were unable to make it a cup double as they lost a close game to Chorley in the Regional Final of the National Knockout Cup.\nThat same year also saw history being made as the Under 11 side clinched the Wirral Junior League with future 1st XI skipper Chris Stenhouse amongst the players involved. Another historic occasion saw three women, Gill Steele, Lindsay Tierney and Carol Nuttall, play for the 4th XI during that season. This led to the formation of the women's team which lasted for a few years before dissolving after 2000.\n1997 proved to be an important year for Park albeit for different reasons. Having finished 22nd out of 25 in the now-expanded league, the club made the bold decision to resign from the Liverpool Competition after competing in it for over 100 years. They were to join fellow clubs Oxton, Neston and Chester Boughton Hall in the newly reformed Cheshire County Cricket League for the following season.\nSettling down in Cheshire.\nThe transition from the Liverpool Comp to Cheshire would provide plenty of ups and downs for the Park over the next fourteen seasons.\n1998 saw them finish mid-table under Martin Smith with the standout match coming against Alderley Edge when Chris Foran and Edge skipper Stuart Bolton both took hat-tricks in the same game.\nWith the Millennium just around the corner, there was a change of captaincy for the 1999 campaign as 24 year-old Foran took charge of the first team thus becoming the youngest captain in the club's history. It proved to be a master-stroke as he led them to Premier League promotion with key contributions coming from Australian batsman Anthony Smith (800 runs) and former skipper Gareth Evans (67 wickets).\nBut preparations for the club's first season in the top flight were complicated when Foran found work in London which resulted in Evans becoming captain for a third spell. Unfortunately, Park had one of their worst ever campaigns as they were relegated by early August and only managed one win which came in the penultimate weekend against Neston. Their points tally of 122 remains a record for teams finishing bottom of the Cheshire County Premier League.\nEvans carried on as skipper and helped the club secure a top half finish in 2001 before handing over the reins to wicket-keeper David Smith for the 2002 season. By then, Park were continuing to develop promising young players which included batsman Tommy Hunter, all-rounder Chris Stenhouse and bowlers Carl Ainsworth and John Costain.\nHowever, the club suffered their second relegation in three years as they had the misfortune of finishing with the worst points tally in Division One. Smith kept his role for 2003 as the club brought in a new overseas professional in the form of New South Welshman left-hander Damon Livermore. The Australian made a crucial difference with the bat as he scored an incredible 1,352 runs (including four centuries) which remains the highest tally by a batsman in Cheshire County Division Two. Along with the excellent bowling of John Costain, Park secured promotion back to the First Division though they narrowly missed out on winning the league. The 2nd XI went one better by landing the title under the captaincy of Jason Rioux.\nLivermore contributed again the following year with over 800 runs as Park endured a topsy-turvy season which saw them go from relegation contenders in August to finishing an ambitious fourth place in Division One. However, 2004 ended with David Smith relinquishing the captaincy after three years at the helm while Livermore returned to Australia and Gareth Evans retired.\nFor the 2005 season, the club were able to appoint Chris Foran as captain again as he brought in a new overseas player in the form of Pakistani leg-spinner Shahid Mahmood. The 1st XI initially struggled early on and found themselves mid-table in June but ended up going unbeaten for the remainder of the season. Promotion and the title was confirmed on the final day when they beat local rivals Upton in front of their home supporters, less than a week after England had defeated Australia in the Ashes. Mahmood finished up with 70 league wickets which included 9-28 against Upton in the reverse fixture though there were vital combinations from various players including Martin Smith, Stephen Potter, Ian Platt, Chris Stenhouse, Carl Ainsworth and new batsman Andrew Gibson.\nThe Cheshire County decline.\nThe success of 2005 would prove to be the last major high point for Park in Cheshire as they found themselves struggling over the next few years. Long distance travelling and overs cricket was starting to have an effect on them.\nHoping to avoid a repeat of their disastrous top flight campaign in 2000, Park started 2006 well with two wins in three but they soon capitulated when they suffered nine defeats in ten games to fall into the relegation zone. One of those losses came in an extraordinary game at Hyde which saw Park chalk up a mammoth 321-4. Shahid Mahmood was to score the quickest century in Cheshire County League history as he brought up his ton off just 29 balls. However all that hard work was extinguished as Hyde chased the total down to win by two wickets in the final over. Once again, Park could only last one season in the highest tier as they were relegated on the final day of the season. Foran stepped down as captain with Andrew Gibson stepping into the breach though the club suffered the blow of losing key players like Mahmood and Chris Stenhouse.\nGibson's bid to freshen the team up with younger players failed to improve things as Park endured another woeful campaign in which they managed only one win in eighteen prior to the final month of the First Division season. With back-to-back relegation looking imminent, they finally turned things around in remarkable fashion as they won their remaining four games to pull off the Great Escape. Tommy Hunter and departing bowler John Costain both performed crucially in those matches with the latter taking five wickets in his final appearance.\n2008 proved to be a bizarre one as Park yet again found themselves in another basement battle and only managed two wins all season. While they struggled for form in the league, they ended up dominating the Cheshire Shield competition as they crushed Marple in the final by 125 runs. However just three weeks later, they suffered their second relegation in three years after losing a low scoring game at fellow strugglers Cheadle.\nWith Gibson departing, Tommy Hunter took over the captaincy but life in Division Two was no better as Park had yet another difficult campaign. They were strengthened by the return of all-rounder Chris Stenhouse but once again, survival was only secured on the final day of the season when they beat Mobberley to stay up. That same year also saw Mark Evans take charge of the 2nd XI for which he would go on to become their most successful captain.\nChris Foran then became only the fourth man to captain Park on three occasions as he took charge again for the 2010 season. An early highlight came in a home draw against Mobberley in which Ian Cooper and Australian batsman Adam Watson both scored centuries in the same innings, a record previously made almost 100 years earlier. However, it ended up being another tough year as Park managed just four wins which seemed to be enough to keep them up with a month to go. Unfortunately, they lost their final five games which resulted in them losing their place in the Cheshire County Cricket League after thirteen seasons.\nNow playing in the Meller Braggins Cricket League, Park had lost the services of Foran and bowler Carl Ainsworth but had a new skipper in Chris Stenhouse. The rebuilding process continued to be affected by some disappointing results early in the 2011 season as they slumped towards the bottom two in June. However, crucial news came that month when the club decided to apply for a return to the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The move was granted which helped the 1st XI turn their fortunes around as Stenhouse produced some incredible bowling performances to ensure Park ended their time in Cheshire with a top 6 finish. Mark Evans also landed his first trophy as 2nd XI skipper as his team won the Meller Braggins 2nd XI Division.\nComing home to the Comp (2012-present).\nPark's return to the Comp was welcomed by many other clubs as all four teams prepared for a fresh start in 2012.\nThings could not have gone any better for them when the first, second and third teams all won their respective leagues in what proved to be one of the most successful seasons in the club's history. The 1st XI held on to top spot in Division Two from June onwards with Stenhouse instrumental with the ball again as he took 70 wickets, a feat which saw him later named the Liverpool Comp Bowler of the Year. However it was his batting that clinched the title as his unbeaten half century helped Park beat Burscough on the final day of the season. The 2nd XI also strolled to their second consecutive title victory while the 3rd XI finally ended their 50-year hunt for trophy success as they won their league under former first team captain Ken Crofton. The Under 20s also performed well making it to the final of the Liverpool Comp Under 20 Knockout Cup only to lose a close game to Rainhill.\nWith the Premier League in their sight, Park's ambitions were made clear in 2013 when they welcomed back former players Chris Foran, Mike Barnes and Adrian Kinsey. However the key signing of experienced spinner Robbie Houghton was to prove crucial in what turned out to be another lucrative year for the club.\nThe first team went from strength to strength as they produced some excellent results to help them stay top of the First Division. While the likes of Barnes, Kinsey and Adam Liu contributed useful runs, Stenhouse and Houghton forged a dynamic bowling partnership as the pair shared 139 wickets over the course of the league season. Park also performed well in the Cheshire Cup as they reached the semi-finals for the first time since 1996 only to suffer a heavy ten wicket defeat against old adversaries Chester Boughton Hall.\nBack-to-back promotion was then clinched with two games to go as Stenhouse claimed eight dismissals against Liverpool to lead his team to the Premier League. The championship was then secured on the final day when Houghton struck a stunning century to help his team to victory at Wigan. The 2nd XI made it a hat-trick of title wins under Mark Evans though the 3rd XI narrowly missed out on winning their division.\nPark's first season in the Liverpool Comp Premier League saw them finish in a satisfactory seventh place. However they would find themselves being overshadowed by the remarkable effort made by the second team as they landed a fourth championship success on the bounce by clinching the 2nd XI Premier Division. They were unable to make it a double as they lost the Chester Cup final to local rivals Wallasey. History was made by the 4th XI as they landed their first trophy success by winning the First Division title.\nDespite their respective mid-table position, the first team lost the services of Stenhouse whose four-year reign as captain ended with him moving to Bootle. Batsman Chris Davies took charge for the 2015 season and managed to bring in quality players like Luke Camden and the Sri Lankan all-rounder Ian Daniel. The latter showed his class with both bat and ball as he scored over 900 runs in all competitions and took 50 wickets. Park were involved in some thrilling games that year which included a memorable away win at National T20 champions Chester Boughton Hall in the Liverpool Echo Knockout Competition. They also pulled off their highest ever run chase victory as they chased down Lytham's total of 258 to seal a sensational win. Records continued to tumble in the final game of the season as the departing Rob Houghton pulled off the remarkable feat of taking his 1000th Liverpool Comp wicket in a defeat by Highfield. Despite that loss, Park finished up in a commendable sixth place.\nUnfortunately the loss of key players like Houghton and Daniel left Park in dire straits throughout 2016 as they suffered one of their worst seasons to finish bottom and be relegated from the Premier League. They will look to bounce back quickly in 2017 when they compete in the First Division.\nClub records.\n1000 runs in a season\nHighest individual scores\nBest bowling figures"

In 2003, Billy Casper Golf took over the contract.\nAvon Field is located in North Avondale and borders Norwood. The course is the oldest municipal course west of the Alleghenies. City records cannot be found for the original course designer. The Donald Ross archival website lists Avon Fields as one of his designs. Others suggest it was designed by a member of the Spaulding family, later famous for sporting goods.\nWhile records show that renowned architect William Langford a revision of the design in 1925.\nAvon is a par 66 18-hole golf course consisting of 12 par 4s and 6 par 3s and a full service driving range. The front and back nines were switched in the 1960s, when construction of the Norwood Lateral provided the impetus to reduce some of the steepest hills and to rework this vintage course"

        "text": "The 2014 World Snooker Championship (officially the 2014 Dafabet World Snooker Championship) was a professional snooker tournament that took place from 19 April to 5 May 2014 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. It was the 38th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship had been held at the Crucible. The tournament was also the last ranking event of the 2013–14 snooker season. The event was sponsored by Dafabet for the first time. A qualifying tournament was held from 8 to 16 April 2014 at the Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield for 16 players, who met 16 seeded participants at the main championships.\nRonnie O'Sullivan was the defending champion, having won the previous year's event by defeating Barry Hawkins in the final. Mark Selby won the 2014 event to capture his first world title by defeating O'Sullivan 18–14 in the final. This was Selby's fourth ranking title, also completing the Triple Crown of World Championship, UK Championship, and Masters titles. Neil Robertson compiled the highest of the tournament, a 140, and scored his 100th century break of the season in his quarter-final win over Judd Trump. The event featured a prize fund of £1,214,000, the winner receiving £300,000.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 World Snooker Championship featured 32 professional players competing in one-on-one snooker matches in a single-elimination format, each match played over several . These 32 players for the event were selected through a mix of the snooker world rankings and a pre-tournament qualification round. The first World Snooker Championship took place in 1927, with the final held at Camkin's Hall in Birmingham, England, and the title was won by Joe Davis. Since 1977, the event has been held at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. , Stephen Hendry and Ronnie O’Sullivan are the event's most successful participants in the modern era, having both won the championship seven times. The defending champion was Ronnie O'Sullivan, who had won the 2013 event, defeating Barry Hawkins in the final to take his fifth title. The winner of the 2014 championship received £300,000, from a total prize fund of £1,214,000. The event was organised by World Snooker in partnership with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA).\nFormat.\nThe 2014 World Snooker Championship was a professional snooker tournament played from 19 April to 5 May 2014 at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield, England. This was the 38th consecutive year that the World Snooker Championship was held at the Crucible Theatre. Of the 32 participants, 16 players qualified for the event from the snooker world rankings, and 16 from a four-round qualifying event held at Ponds Forge International Sports Centre in Sheffield, England. The event was the last of twelve ranking events in the 2013–14 snooker season on the World Snooker Tour. The tournament was sponsored by sports betting company Dafabet for the first time, replacing previous sponsors Betfair.\nPrize fund.\nThe total prize money for the 2014 World Snooker Championship was £1,214,000, a raise from the previous year's £1,111,000. The winner received £300,000, an increase of £50,000 over the previous year. The breakdown of prize money for the 2014 event is shown below:\nTournament summary.\nQualifying.\nFour former world champions lost in the qualifying rounds. Six-time champion Steve Davis was defeated by Craig Steadman, a match Davis needed to win to retain his place on the World Snooker Tour. Two-time champion Mark Williams lost to Alan McManus in the final qualifying round 8–10 and failed to play at the main championship for the first time since 1996. Graeme Dott lost to Kyren Wilson 7–10, whilst Peter Ebdon lost 8–10 to Robin Hull. The loss for Ebdon meant that he ended 22 consecutive appearances at the event since his debut in 1992. Two previous runners-up also did not qualify. Six-time finalist Jimmy White lost in the second qualifying round to Ian Burns 10–4, whilst two-time runner-up Matthew Stevens lost to Tom Ford.\nFor the first time, no Welsh player automatically qualified to play at the Crucible. Three Welshmen, Dominic Dale, Michael White, and Ryan Day, won places in the first round through qualification. At the age of 44, 1997 champion Ken Doherty defeated Dechawat Poomjaeng 10–5 in qualifying to become the oldest player to reach the main stage. Kyren Wilson, Michael Wasley, Xiao Guodong, and Robbie Williams all made their debuts in the competition by coming through qualifying.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was played as best-of-19 matches held over two between 19 and 24 April 2014. Defending champion Ronnie O'Sullivan drew world number 122 Robin Hull in the first round, and won 10–4. The 2010 World Snooker Championship winner Neil Robertson won his first round match against Robbie Williams, leading 7–2 after the first session, and won 10–2. In his victory, he compiled breaks of 102, 102, 103, 132, and the tournament's highest of 140 to take his season total of century breaks to 97. The 2005 champion Shaun Murphy trailed 5–7 behind against Jamie Cope, before the pair played a deciding frame at 9–9. Murphy took the frame 65–49 to win the match. Third seed Mark Selby also won a deciding frame, as he defeated Michael White 10–9.\nFourth seed Ding Junhui had previously won five ranking events in the season, a record he jointly held with Stephen Hendry. In his first round match he was defeated 9–10 by debutant Michael Wasley, and so failed to set a new record for tournament wins in a season. Ken Doherty won the last seven frames of his match against sixth seed Stuart Bingham to win 10–5, recording his first victory at the event since 2006. Alan McManus achieved his first Crucible win since 2005 by defeating fellow Scot John Higgins 10–7, while Dominic Dale won his first Crucible match since 2000 by defeating 13th seed Mark Davis 10–5. The final frame of Ricky Walden's first-round match against Kyren Wilson lasted 73 minutes 13 seconds, just under two minutes short of the Crucible record of 74 minutes 58 seconds that Stephen Maguire and Mark King set in 2009. Walden won the frame to clinch a 10–7 victory. Qualifier Ryan Day defeated tenth seed Stephen Maguire 10–9.\nDuring the first round, a \"Ladies' Day\" at the tournament featured events designed to encourage greater female participation in the sport. The day was also used to raise money for the Bluebell Wood Children's Hospice in Rotherham.\nSecond round.\nThe second round was played as best-of-25 frame matches over three sessions between 25 and 28 April 2014. O'Sullivan trailed Joe Perry throughout the first two sessions of their match, but ultimately won 13–11. O'Sullivan described the encounter with Perry as \"probably my most exciting match ever at the Crucible.\" McManus played Doherty and won six frames in a row from 4–3 ahead to lead 10–3, and later won 13–8. This was McManus' first quarter-final appearance since 2005, when he also beat Doherty in the second round. Murphy led Marco Fu 9–7 after the first two sessions, before winning four of the next five frames to win 13–8.\nDale defeated Wasley 13–4 to reach his first World Championship quarter-final since 2000. In defeating Mark Allen 13–7, Robertson added two more century breaks to bring his season total to 99. In the last two frames he made breaks of 94 and 92, narrowly missing his 100th century of the season. Barry Hawkins met Walden in a repeat of the previous year's semi-final. Hawkins won again, this time 13–11, to reach his second Crucible quarter-final. Selby led Ali Carter 9–7 after the first two sessions, and won three frames in a row to lead 12–7. Carter won the next two frames before Selby won the 20th frame by 82 points to 19 to win 13–9. In the last second round match, seventh seed Judd Trump defeated Day 13–7.\nQuarter-finals.\nThe quarter-finals were played as best-of-25 frame matches across three sessions between 29 and 30 April. Selby and McManus only completed seven of the scheduled eight frames in the first session of their match as they ran out of time, with Selby leading 4–3. Selby won eight of the nine in the second session to lead 12–4, and won the second frame of the final session to win 13–5. Having trailed 0–2 and needing three snookers in the third frame, O'Sullivan won 13 of the last 14 frames to defeat Shaun Murphy 13–3, ending the match with a .\nHawkins opened up a 6–2 lead over Dominic Dale in the first session, and extended his lead to 11–5 after two sessions. In the final session, Dale fought back to win seven frames in a row and take the lead 12–11, but Hawkins captured the last two frames to win the match 13–12. Neil Robertson trailed Judd Trump 2–6 after the first session, and 6–9 after the second, before he won seven of the last nine frames to win the match 13–11. In the 22nd frame, Robertson compiled his 100th century break of the 2013–14 snooker season.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played as best-of-33 frame matches over four sessions on 2 and 3 May. O'Sullivan and Hawkins contested the first semi-final, a rematch of the previous year's final. O'Sullivan led at 10–2, but Hawkins won three of the next four to trail overnight 11–5. O'Sullivan made breaks of 76, 55, 103 and 84 and later won the match 17–7 in the final frame of the third session. This was the first time in ten years that a player had won two matches with a session to spare in the same event, having done so himself previously in 2004. That year, O'Sullivan won the championship one frame into the final session.\nIn the second semi-final, a match that lasted 12 hours and 4 minutes, Selby defeated Robertson 17–15 to reach his second World Championship final. Selby had previously reached the final once before in 2007. During the match, Robertson extended his century break record to 103, but his defeat meant that he lost his world number one position.\nFinal.\nThe final was played on the 4 and 5 May 2014 between Ronnie O'Sullivan and Mark Selby as best-of-35 frames, held over four sessions and was refereed by Brendan Moore. This was the first time that Moore had presided over a World Championship final. In the first session on Sunday afternoon, O'Sullivan took a 5–3 lead, which he extended in the evening session to 8–3 and 10–5. Selby took the last two frames of the day to leave O'Sullivan with a 10–7 overnight lead. O'Sullivan's highest break on the first day was a 131 in the 14th frame, while Selby's highest break of the day was just 62.\nThe third session concluded after just six of the scheduled eight frames. Selby won five of the six frames to go into the final session with a 12–11 lead. He then won three of the first four frames of the evening session, extending his lead to 15–12 at the mid-session interval, before winning the final 18–14 to capture his first world title. In all, Selby won 13 of the last 17 frames, and scored his two highest breaks of the match in frames 30 and 31 to increase his lead from 15–14 to 17–14. This was Selby's fourth ranking title, and made him the ninth player to win all three Triple Crown events, reinstating him as the world number one.\nO'Sullivan said \"I want to congratulate Mark on a fantastic tournament. He's been the best player over 17 days... In the end I was numb as he was too strong and tough.\" Selby dedicated the title to his late father, who died two months before he turned professional.\nMain draw.\nThe draw for the first round took place on 17 April 2014, one day after the qualifying, and was broadcast live on World Snooker's YouTube channel at 12 pm BST.

        "text": "Timothy Blake Taylor (March 26,1942April 27,2013) was an American ice hockey head coach. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts and grew up in South Natick, Massachusetts. He was the long-time head coach of the Yale Bulldogs from 1976-77 until his retirement in 2005-06 season. He twice took leaves of absence from his collegiate duties to coach the US Olympic Team (1984 and 1994) as well as serving as Team USA's head coach for the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships and the 1991 Canada Cup. At the time of his retirement Taylor had served as Yale's head ice hockey coach for longer than anyone else, earning more wins (337) and losses (433) for the Bulldogs than all others. The respect Taylor had earned over his career was exemplified by ECAC Hockey renaming its annual coaches award in his honor shortly after his retirement as well as the NCAA renaming its national rookie-of-the-Year award after him a few months after his death. In 2015 he was posthumously awarded the Legends of College Hockey Award, by the Hobey Baker Memorial Award Committee.\nCareer.\nPlayer.\nTim Taylor began his collegiate hockey career as a center for Harvard eventually rising to become captain in his senior season and leading the Crimson to its first ECAC regular season and conference tournament championships in 1963. After graduating with a degree in English, Taylor sought a spot on the 1964 US Olympic Team to defend its first Gold medal, but was ultimately cut from the roster shortly before the games began. After the disappointment, Taylor joined the Waterloo Blackhawks of the USHL (then a semi-professional league), suiting up for them from 1964 thru 1969, excluding a brief stint for the 1965 US National Team and the Warroad Lakers later that year. During the 1968–69 season, Taylor made his way back to the Northeast, briefly playing for the Manchester Blackhawks of the New England Hockey League before accepting an assistant coaching position with his alma mater.\nCoach.\nHis first coaching job didn't last very long as Taylor left Harvard after the 1969-70 season to continue his playing career. Two years later he returned to coaching for good, helping the newly appointed Bill Cleary reach the frozen four in both 1974 and 1975. A year later, after recording the two worst records in Yale's history, Paul Lufkin was relieved of his duties and Taylor was tabbed as his successor.\nBehind the bench for his alma mater's arch-rival, Taylor swiftly returned Yale to respectability, shepherding the team to a winning season by his third year. Though Taylor had no postseason success through his first seven campaigns he was nonetheless invited to join Team USA's staff for the 1984 Winter Olympics. Taylor turned over his position at Yale to Mike Gilligan for the 1983-84 season to help team USA defend its second gold medal. The '84 team, however, was not able to capture the same magic as their predecessors and finished a disappointing 7th. Taylor returned to Yale the following year and the Bulldogs responded by playing two of the best years for the school since World War II posting 19- and then 20-win seasons, including Yale's first ever postseason victory in the 25th year of the ECAC Tournament. While the Bulldogs' fortunes declined after that, Taylor was asked to be the head coach for Team USA at the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships. Once again, the Americans' had a poor showing, finishing 6th out of 8 teams. Despite the lack of international success, Taylor was behind the bench less than two years later for Team USA, this time in the 1991 Canada Cup, where the Americans had a much better fate as runners-up to the champion Canadian team.\nOnce again Yale's records improved after Taylor's international showing, posting winning seasons for the two years after the Canada Cup before Taylor took a second season off from Yale, this time to be the head coach of the US Olympic Team at the 1994 Winter Olympics. With Dan Poliziani standing in for him in New Haven for 1993-94. Taylor was able to get Team USA into the championship round with a 1-1-3 record, but they were soundly defeated by eventual Bronze medalist Finland in the quarterfinals. After 1994 Taylor remained exclusively with his collegiate position until his retirement. 1997-98 ended up being his best season as he earned the only regular season crown of his career and only NCAA berth (Yale lost 0–4 to Ohio State in its first game).\nThough Taylor retired from his position at Yale following the 2005–06 season, he remained active in hockey, serving as an assistant coach for Team USA's under-18 squads in 2008 and 2010 as well as team manager for the World Junior Championship teams in 2011 and 2012.\nTaylor's health began to decline in later years and he was eventually diagnosed with cancer. He died on April 27, 2013, but not before he was able to witness Yale, the team he had coached for almost three decades, win its first national title under former assistant Keith Allain, which it was able to do two weeks before Taylor's death."

        "text": "The National Rugby Championship, known as NRC, was an Australian rugby union competition. It was contested by eight teams, seven from Australia and one from Fiji. The tournament ran from 2014 until 2019 before being disbanded in 2020 following the change of the Australian rugby TV broadcasting deal from Fox Sports, who had funded the competition, to Stan Sport. The 2020 competition was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFormat.\nThe National Rugby Championship was usually held between late August and early November. A round-robin tournament was scheduled first where each team played all others once. The top four teams progressed to the championship playoffs consisting of two semi-final knockout matches and a grand final to determine the champion team and winner of the NRC Trophy, nicknamed 'The Toast Rack'.\nDuring the round-robin section of the tournament, teams would also play for the Horan-Little Shield, a challenge trophy put on the line by the holders when a challenge match was accepted or mandated according to the Shield rules.\nTeams.\nThe teams that competed in the National Rugby Championship were. \nTelevision coverage and streaming.\nTwo of the NRC matches each weekend were broadcast live via Fox Sports, with the remaining matches shown on the Fox Sports streaming platform. Discussion of the NRC competition was included on Fox Sports' review show NRC Extra Time on Monday nights, and the Kick &amp; Chase program on Tuesday evenings.\nHistory.\nIn December 2013, the ARU announced that Australia would get another tier of competition under Super Rugby in line with South Africa’s Currie Cup and New Zealand's Mitre 10 Cup (then known as ITM Cup). Eleven bids were tendered from teams wanting to participate in the tournament, with nine being accepted. Applicants that were not successful were advised that they could bid again as the competition matured, as early as 2015.\nThe National Rugby Championship followed a previous national competition, the Australian Rugby Championship, that was abandoned after the first season in 2007 due to financial losses.\nThe construction company Buildcorp was the inaugural naming rights sponsor for the NRC competition, with other partners including Intercontinental Hotels, Qantas, and Allianz also signed. ASICS was the official apparel supplier for the first two seasons. Matches were played under approved law variations, intended to increase the speed of the game.\nA new broadcasting deal agreed in 2015 secured the funding and future of the competition until the end of the 2020 season. The competition was reduced from nine teams to eight when the ARU did not renew the NRC licence for the Sydney Stars in 2016, citing insufficient player talent to support four competitive teams in New South Wales.\nA team from Fiji, the Fijian Drua, joined the competition for the 2017 season. For the 2018 season, the Greater Sydney Rams were dropped from the competition, leaving Sydney with just one team, the Rays.\nSponsorship.\nThe tournament is run by Rugby Australia with the sponsorship of Foxtel which provides television coverage on its Fox Sports channels. Gilbert is the official supplier of all rugby balls.\nPlayer selection.\nAustralia's Super Rugby players participate in the NRC under a capped allocation to ensure that all NRC teams have a mix of players from local development squads and club competitions, as well as those with Super Rugby experience. Australian national team players are required for Test match rugby during the NRC season, but each player is allocated to one of the NRC teams and is able to play if released from national duty."

        "text": "The 2014 NAIA Division II Men's Basketball national championship was held in March at Keeter Gymnasium in Point Lookout, Missouri. The 21st annual NAIA basketball tournament featured thirty-two teams playing in a single-elimination format. The championship game was won by Indiana Wesleyan of Marion, Indiana over Midland University of Fremont, Nebraska by a score of 78 to 68.\nTournament field.\nThe 2014 tournament field was announced March 5, 2014. The field featured defending champion and top seed Cardinal Stritch University as well as runner-up William Penn University. Two conferences, the Crossroads League and The Sun Conference garnered four bids apiece, while four other conferences received three bids each. The field included five first-time attendees: Cincinnati Christian University, Northern New Mexico College from Española, New Mexico, Northwest Christian University from Eugene, Oregon, Reinhardt University of Alpharetta, Georgia and Southeastern University of Lakeland, Florida.\nCollege of the Ozarks, who received an automatic bid as the host team, leads the field in total invitations with eighteen, while Bethel College of Mishawaka, Indiana leads the field with three national championships. Defending national champion Cardinal Stritch of Milwaukee, Wisconsin earned an automatic berth as regular-season champions out of the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference, the Wolves eleventh championship appearance overall and fifth-straight. They entered the championship as the top ranked team in each of the last seven Coaches' Polls.\nHighlights.\nFirst round.\nThe first round was fairly typical, with higher seeded teams winning most games with only a couple of exceptions. Unseeded William Penn from Oskaloosa, Iowa and sixth seed Dordt College of Sioux Center, Iowa played a memorable double-overtime game. The teams combined for two hundred and thirty-four points, besting the old mark for most combined points in a game (two hundred twenty-two) set by Cornerstone University from Grand Rapids, Michigan and Bethel in 1999. With less than a minute in the second overtime, Kelly Madison hit a step-back three to put the William Penn Statesmen on top one hundred eighteen to one hundred sixteen for the win over the Defenders. Madison recorded the tournaments highest individual scoring performance with thirty-eight points while teammate Alex Schwab scored twenty-seven. Blake Walker managed a triple-double with ten points, eleven rebounds and ten assists. For Dordt, Austin Katje put in thirty-three points, tying for the third most three-pointers made with eight and three-pointers attempted with eighteen. Nathan Rindels tallied a triple-double as well, with twenty-one points, eleven rebounds and fourteen assists. Two other Defenders, Kyle Lindbergh (twenty, ten) and Dalton Franken (twenty-five, ten) achieved double-doubles. Dordt played the entire second overtime with just one starter (Lindbergh) on the floor due to fouls.\nThe Thursday evening session began with the first overtime game of the day as Demarko Nash of Robert Morris hit a three-pointer with two seconds left in regulation put the game into overtime. Robert Morris continued to defeat number fourteen Saint Francis sixty-nine to sixty-three.\nThe big upset of the day came as the Bobcats from host school College of the Ozarks shot sixty-one per cent from the field while using their home-court advantage and huge games from junior Alex Santiago and Nathan Simniok to upset the number two-seeded College of Idaho Yotes. In another close game, St Thomas Bobcats’ guard Kevin Hincapie knocked down a three-pointer from the left win as time expired to propel his team to victory over Union.\nSecond round.\nWhile the first round was quiet, the second round of the 2014 tourney was filled with upsets as the three remaining top-four seeds went down. Unseeded Southeastern University from Lakeland, Florida, led by a twenty-nine point, eight for eight from the field (four for four from beyond the arc) performance by Jake Hodges, needed a three pointer from Dwayne Johnson with two tenths of a second left to take down top seed and defending champion Cardinal Stritch. After ten lead changes in the last eight minutes, Stritch had a two-point lead with less than five seconds remaining. Johnson brought the ball the length of the floor and fired a three at the buzzer for a one-point Fire win.\nIn spite of a twenty-one point performance by Vernon Payne, the unseeded Robert Morris Eagles made a 7-0 run to finish the game and eliminated the three seed Indiana University Southeast Grenadiers, 71-66. Fourth seeded Cornerstone met their match in unseeded Friends. Friends came out shooting and cruised to an eighteen-point lead behind NAIA player of the year Joe Mitchell, ultimately winning the game seventy-nine to sixty-nine. When the round was over, the only seeded teams remaining were number five Indiana Wesleyan, number nine Davenport, and number ten, Midland.\nElite Eight.\nAfter scoring two-hundred and twenty-two points in the first two rounds, the William Penn Statesmen's run was brought to an end by Robert Morris (Illinois) in a seventy-nine to seventy-eight contest. The Statesmen scored the first eight points of the game, but the Eagles turned to Harry Singh off the bench for three three-pointers and Jarrell Turner for a two to gain the lead at 29-28. William Penn regained the lead on a three by Demarko Nash and held a narrow lead until layups by Blake Walker and Alec Schwab brought the margin to one point with just over a minute left. Neither team was able to score for the rest of the contest, leaving Robert Morris to advance to the Fab Four by virtue of a one-point victory. First-time guest Southeastern continued its run of victories over higher-seeded teams with a three-point win over Davenport, while the Indiana Wesleyan Wildcats continued its streak of double-digit wins with a ninety-five to seventy-nine win over Friends. The fourth semifinal position was claimed by the Midland Warriors with a seventy-six to seventy win over three-time champion Bethel College.\nFab Four.\nAs befits a tournament of upsets, three of the four teams were in their first-ever Fab Four appearance. In the first semifinal game, Indiana Wesleyan took off to an early lead over the Southeastern Fire. A Jake Hodges free throw for Southeastern tied the game at eight, but IWU answered right back and never trailed again, although the Fire would pull back within three just before the half on a layup by Dana Thomas. Indiana Wesleyan used disciplined offense and unrelenting defense to gradually pullaway to a ninety-eight to seventy-seven victory. Jordan Weidner scored twenty-nine points for the Wildcats and was joined in double figures by brothers R.J. Mahurin and Lane Mahurin, Nathan Bubash and Zac Vandewater. For the Fire, Dwayne Johnson led with 28 points, followed by Hodges and Thomas with eleven and Timothy Mitchell with ten.\nOn the other half of the bracket, Midland recorded an impressive one hundred to sixty-one shellacking of Robert Morris. In what was to become the widest Fab Four margin of victory in tournament history, Midland jumped to a sixteen to two lead over Robert Morris just three minutes into the game. Ben Imig led Midland with twenty-seven points, while Alex Starkel and Galen Gullie added fourteen and thirteen respectively. Jarrel Turner led Robert Morris with fourteen points while Sean Montgomery added ten points. Courtney Bell grabbed eleven boards for Robert Morris.\nChampionship game.\nThe fifth-seeded Indiana Wesleyan Wildcats became the first team in the history of the tournament to win all of its contests by double digits as they defeated the Midland Warriors by ten points for the crown. IWU never trailed in the game, building a ten-point lead just seven minutes into the game. Midland closed to within one point on a three pointer by Avery Langford, but baskets by Zac Vandewater and Lane Mahurin quickly put IWU back up by five. In the second half, Indiana Wesleyan took control, ultimately winning the game by a score of seventy-eight to sixty-eight. Jordan Weidner led the Wildcats in scoring with twenty-one. He was joined in double figures by RJ Mahurin with nineteen, Lane Mahurin with eleven and Zac Vandewater with ten. Vandewater led all teams in rebounding with ten. For Midland, Ben Imig led in scoring with seventeen, along with a team leading six assists. He was closely followed by Franklin Marcus with fifteen and Alex Starkel with ten. Starkel added nine rebounds, while Brandon Williams grabbed seven.\nEpilogue.\nOnly two players who made it to the tournament Fab Four, Jordan Weidner of Indiana Wesleyan (who was named the tournaments Most Outstanding Player), and Dwayne Johnson of Southeastern were named to the NAIA All-America team. The post-season coaches poll on the other hand was heavily influenced by the outcome of the tournament, as Indiana Wesleyan and Midland wound up in first and second place respectively, while Southeastern and Robert Morris wound up third and fifth. Cardinal Stritch fell to fourth in the rankings. Indiana Wesleyan head coach Greg Tonagel was honored as the NABC Division II Men's Basketball Coach of the Year and Todd Eisner of Midland (Neb.) was named the NAIA Division II Men's Basketball Coach of the Year. Mitchell Wiggins of Southeastern was drafted by the Harlem Globetrotters."

Situated north of Iloilo City, it spans a area of plain and rolling hills in Barangay San Sebastian in Santa Barbara. It is considered the first golf club in the Philippines and the oldest existing golf course in Southeast Asia.\nIt was the first Philippine golf club to be accepted as an affiliate of one of the oldest and most prestigious golf clubs in the world, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, based in Scotland.\nHistory.\nThe golf course was established as the Santa Barbara Golf Course in 1907 by a group of Scottish expatriates involved in building the Panay line of Panay Railways, completed the same year. It opened to the public in 1913 as a basic 9-hole course. Initially, the club was exclusive to English and Scottish migrants, but by the late 1920s, wealthy Filipino landowners gained entry, including Mariano Cacho, Oscar Ledesma, Tomas Confesor, William Gemperle, and the brothers Eugenio and Fernando Lopez. With the establishment of the Philippine Commonwealth in 1935, more Filipinos became involved in government and business, further enhancing Iloilo’s mestizo elite to acquired economic power.\nThe Santa Barbara Golf Course became a prominent golfing hub, attracting enthusiasts not only from the Visayas but also from Manila. Its skilled caddies produced talented professionals sought after by clubs in Manila, including Siodina, Nadales, Rates, Pinet, and Sinfuego, reflecting the course's significant influence. Notable American and British golfers like Gene Sarazen and Jug McSpaden frequented Santa Barbara during their visits to the Philippines.\nAfter World War II, returning migrants, together with members of the now-destroyed Polo Golf Club in Polo, Arevalo, Iloilo City, reestablished the club as the Iloilo Golf and Country Club in 1947.\nThe National Historical Institute (NHI) validated the club's history and designated it a national historical site in 2007, marking its centenary year. The unveiling of its historical marker was attended by former President Fidel V. Ramos, an avid golfer himself, NHI Director Ambeth Ocampo, British Embassy dignitaries, members of the Iloilo elite, and participants of the Mayor’s Cup."

        "text": "Lord Hawke selected a cricket team of ten amateurs and two professional players to tour Australia and New Zealand from November 1902 until March 1903. After an opening game in San Francisco, the tour began of eighteen matches - seven of them considered first-class - in New Zealand followed by three further first-class games in Australia. Hawke's team was the first to tour Australasia with New Zealand as the primary destination and, as was the norm at the time, was privately run and funded. The Australian leg of the tour was a \"profit making venture\", however the games in New Zealand were scheduled at the behest of the New Zealand Cricket Board in order to raise the profile of cricket in the country. Two of them were against a New Zealand cricket team, before its international Test status. The inclusion of such games on the tour were considered \"a sign that cricket in New Zealand was starting to be taken more seriously, and a move towards official international status was possible.\"\nHawke's team was a strong one, including Pelham Warner, Bernard Bosanquet and Frederick Fane, and it was victorious in all eighteen matches of the New Zealand tour, though it was defeated in two of the three matches in Australia.&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in Australia, 1902/03 Victoria v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\" Lord Hawke's XI in Australia, 1902/03 New South Wales v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in Australia, 1902/03 South Australia v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nHawke's team.\nHawke had intended to captain the team, but was unable to make the tour after breaking his collarbone the day before the team left England. Hawke asked Warner to captain the team, which was referred to throughout as \"Lord Hawke's team\".\nThe team was as follows: Warner opened the batting; his opening partner was Cambridge University alumni and MCC cricketer Cuthbert Burnup, a right-handed batsman and useful right-arm slow bowler; Fane, a right-handed batsman for England and Essex; Tom Taylor, a Yorkshire right-hand batsman and wicketkeeper; Edward Dowson, of Surrey; leading all-round cricketer Bosanquet; George Thompson of Northamptonshire and John Stanning of the MCC; Randall Johnson of the MCC; Arthur Whatman who also kept wicket; Albert Leatham and Sam Hargreave. Nat Williams, who was living in New Zealand at the time, played in seven of the minor matches in New Zealand when members of the original team were injured or otherwise unavailable.\nThe tour.\nThe team stopped in California in the United States on their way to New Zealand, playing against a California XI at the Presidio Athletic Ground in San Francisco in front of five-hundred spectators. A non-first-class game, California were entitled to play eighteen players, with Bosanquet taking 11 of the wickets to fall as the hosts were dismissed for 125. Hawke's team made it to 155/8 thanks to half-centuries from Bosanquet and Warner, having been allowed to bat on beyond the winning total.\nNew Zealand.\nHawke's team landed in New Zealand and played their opening first-class game against Auckland on 19 December. Hawke's team took an innings victory, with Fane scoring 82 in their first innings total of 321 all out. Auckland, with scores of 120 and 72 following on, fell to a heavy defeat.&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in New Zealand, 1902/03 Auckland v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Five minor provincial matches followed: Taranaki, North Taranaki, Wanganui, Manawatu and Hawke's Bay all played the touring team and were all defeated, with Bosanquet scoring a century in the last of these matches. Wellington cricket team then played Hawke's XI on 15 January, posting 243 in their first innings that Hawke's team could only move 46 runs clear of before being dismissed. Wellington, however, fell to 140-all out thanks to 7/51 by George Thompson, with Warner and Cuthbert Burnup reaching the target of 95 without loss.&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in New Zealand, 1902/03 Wellington v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Wellington match drew 15,000 spectators, and takings of 650 pounds, a record for a cricket match in New Zealand at the time.\nFour more minor provincial games followed: Wairarapa, Marlborough, Nelson and Westland. Then Hawke's team defeated Canterbury by 133 runs on 6 February, with half-centuries for Warner and Burnup,&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in New Zealand, 1902/03 Canterbury v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and then Otago by an innings and 230 runs on 13 February, with a five-wicket haul for Burnup and a double-century for Warner.&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in New Zealand, 1902/03 Otago v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There was controversy during the Canterbury match. Bosanquet was the fourth bowler used in by Hawke's team during the second innings and with his third ball, it looked as if he had bowled Walter Pearce behind his legs as he attempted a big hit. However, both umpires were unsighted and the non-striker Arthur Sims, who also had his view obscured, urged Pearce not to leave the middle. The tourists' wicket keeper, Arthur Whatman, Bosanquet and other English players surrounded the umpire, who decided Pearce was not out. Bosanquet then turned to Sims and said: \"You're a nice cheat. I bowled him round his legs. Anybody could see that.\" Sims responded that there was reasonable doubt, but Whatman began to swear and call him a cheat. The English team were severely criticised in the press and Sims' employers refused to release him for any further matches unless Bosanquet apologised. Bosanquet wrote letters of apology to Sims and to the Canterbury Cricket Association, and Sims later told him to forget about it, but Sims' employers would not let him take part in the remaining games.\nAfter victory in a minor match against Southland, South Island were defeated by an innings on 21 February, with a century made by Tom Taylor.&lt;ref name=\"Lord Hawke's XI in New Zealand, 1902/03 South Island v Lord Hawke's XI\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nAfter defeating South Canterbury in a minor match on 25 February, Hawke's team played two games against New Zealand. New Zealand were dismissed for 164 in the first innings of the first of these two games, which began on 27 February. Thompson took 6/38. Fane then scored 124 runs of Hawke's 304 all out, and then Thompson (4/74) and Bosanquet (4/44) restricted New Zealand to 214, leaving Hawke's team 75 runs to get. They reached the target for the loss of only three wickets. The second match on 4 March saw a century from New Zealand's Daniel Reese, and another for Warner, before Burnup's 5/8 from 4.5 overs handed Hawke's team an innings victory.\nAustralia.\nHawke's victorious team landed in Australia later in March, and played the opening game of three matches on 13 March at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hawke's XI had greater difficulty contending with the Australian Sheffield Shield teams, and were defeated by Victoria. They managed to draw their match against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 20 March with Albert Trott taking 6/88 and Reggie Duff scoring 194. Bosanquet also took 6/153 during the match, including the wicket of Victor Trumper, the leading Australian batsman and one of the best in the world at the time. He delivered two conventional leg breaks followed by a googly, later described by Bosanquet as the first bowled in Australia, which bowled Trumper. Many critics were impressed by the wicket-taking potential of googly bowling on hard pitches, and Warner later described Bosanquet's bowling as causing a sensation.\nOn 27 March at the Unley Oval, South Australia defeated Hawke's XI by 97 runs despite centuries from Burnup and Taylor. In the second innings Henry Hay took 9/67 for the host team."

The West Indies played against the New Zealand Max Blacks on December 3, losing the game. They then faced New Zealand 'A' on December 5, and Auckland on December 10, with both matches drawn. The first Test match began on December 16, with the West Indies following their first innings score of 365 - featuring centuries by openers Adrian Griffith and Sherwin Campbell - with 97 all out thanks to a seven-wicket haul by Chris Cairns. Former West Indian fast-bowler criticised the West Indian performance as \"second rate.\" Cairns finished the two-Test series with 17 wickets at a bowling average of 9.94.&lt;ref name=\"West Indies in New Zealand, 1999/00 Test Series Averages\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nNew Zealand proceeded to reach 518 in the first innings of the second Test with Mathew Sinclair scoring a double-century, and the West Indies batted twice for 179 and 243, losing by an innings and 105 runs. The home team went on to win the ODI series 5:0. The first match was rain-affected, with New Zealand taking a three-wicket victory on Duckworth Lewis. Victory margins of seven wickets, four wickets, eight wickets and twenty runs followed in the remaining four games. Nathan Astle scored 320 across the series, with four half-centuries, while Daniel Vettori took nine wickets.&lt;ref name=\"West Indies in New Zealand, 1999/00 ODI Series Averages \"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;"

        "text": "The 2016 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament to determine the men's National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college basketball national champion for the 2015–16 season. The 78th edition of the Tournament began on March 15, 2016, and concluded with the championship game on April 4 at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas. This was the first NCAA tournament to adopt the NCAA March Madness branding, including fully-branded courts at each of the tournament venues.\nUpsets were the story of the first round of the Tournament; No. 15 seed Middle Tennessee upset No. 2 seed Michigan State in the biggest upset, just the eighth ever win for a No. 15 seed over a No. 2. At least one team seeded #9 through #15 won a first-round game for the third time ever and the first time since 2013.\nIn the Final Four, Villanova defeated Oklahoma, while North Carolina defeated Syracuse (the \"Cinderella team\" of the tournament). Villanova then defeated North Carolina to win the championship on a three-point buzzer beater by Kris Jenkins. Pundits called the game one of the best in tournament history, going on to say this was one of the most competitive finals ever.\nSchedule and venues.\nPreviously, the round of 64 was known as the second round since the 2011 edition, but it was reverted to the moniker first round for this coming tournament. The first four was previously named the first round.\nFirst four\nFirst and second rounds\nRegional semifinals and finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nQualifying and selection procedure.\nOut of 336 eligible Division I teams, 68 participate in the tournament. Of the total, 15 Division I teams were ineligible due to failing to meet APR requirements, self-imposed postseason bans, or reclassification from a lower division.\nOf the 32 automatic bids, 31 were given to programs that won their conference tournaments. For the final time, the Ivy League awarded its NCAA Tournament bid to the team with the best regular-season record and did not hold a tournament (unless playoffs games were needed to resolve tied champions). The Ivy League will hold a postseason tournament for the first time after the 2016–17 Ivy League season. The remaining 36 bids were granted on an \"at-large\" basis, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee to the teams it deems to be the best 36 teams that did not receive automatic bids.\nEight teams—the four lowest-seeded automatic qualifiers and the four lowest-seeded at-large teams—played in the First Four (the successor to what had been popularly known as \"play-in games\" through the 2010 tournament). The winners of these games advanced to the first round (round of 64). The Selection Committee also seeded the entire field from 1 to 68.\nAutomatic qualifiers.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2016 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's automatic bid:\nBracket.\nAll times are listed as Eastern Daylight Time ()&lt;br&gt;\nFirst Four – Dayton, Ohio.\nThe First Four games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.\nFinal Four.\nDuring the Final Four round, regardless of the seeds of the participating teams, the champion of the top overall top seed's region (Kansas's South Region) plays against the champion of the fourth-ranked top seed's region (Oregon's West Region), and the champion of the second overall top seed's region (North Carolina's East Region) plays against the champion of the third-ranked top seed's region (Virginia's Midwest Region).\nNRG Stadium – Houston, Texas.\nFinal Four.\nThe Villanova–Oklahoma result was not only the most one-sided in the tournament so far, but also in the history of the men's Final Four. The Wildcats shot 71.4% for the game, surpassed in Final Four games only by the Wildcats' 78.6% performance in the 1985 final against Georgetown. The 44-point margin was also greater than the combined margin of defeat in Oklahoma's seven previous losses in 2015–16. In addition, the 2016 semifinals were the first since 2008 to both be decided by double-digit margins, and the combined 61-point margin broke a men's Final Four record set in 1949.\nNational Championship.\nThe Wildcats' Championship run was the 3rd most dominant in NCAA Tournament history, with a total point differential of +124 (breaking the 2009 record set by the North Carolina Tar Heels of +121), behind the 1996 Kentucky Wildcats (+129) and the 2024 UConn Huskies (+140).\nTournament notes.\nAmerica East Conference champion Stony Brook and WAC champion Cal State Bakersfield made their first NCAA Tournament appearances in school history.\nYale made its first NCAA appearance since 1962 as winners of the Ivy League, which, for the final time, did not stage a conference tournament. Of those that do hold a tournament, Horizon League champion Green Bay made its first appearance since 1996 and Oregon State made its first appearance since 1990.\nYale also earned its first Tournament win in school history with a 79–75 win over Baylor. Hawaii likewise earned its first NCAA Tournament win by defeating California 77–66. Arkansas-Little Rock won its first Tournament game in 30 years and Middle Tennessee won its first Tournament game in 27 years.\nIn the Midwest Region, No. 15 seed Middle Tennessee upset No. 2 seed Michigan State for just the eighth ever win for a No. 15 seed over a No. 2. More than one-third of ESPN Tournament Challenge brackets predicted Michigan State to make the Final Four.\nIn the East Region, No. 14 seed Stephen F. Austin upset No. 3 seed West Virginia, marking the fourth straight tournament in which a No. 14 seed upset a No. 3 seed.\nBy winning the Midwest Regional final, Syracuse became the first No. 10 seed in history to advance to the Final Four. However, six lower seeds, all No. 11 , have advanced to that stage (in 1986, 2006, 2011, 2018, 2021, and 2024.\nKansas extended its streak of consecutive tournament appearances to 27 in a row, making every NCAA Tournament dating back to 1990. This tied the record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances held by North Carolina (1975–2001).\nThis Tournament marked the first championship for Villanova in 31 years. It was also the first championship by a school without a Division I FBS football team since Connecticut in 1999. Villanova fields a Division I FCS football team, as did UConn before 2002.\nUpsets.\nPer the NCAA, \"Upsets are defined as when the winner of the game was seeded five or more places lower than the team it defeated.\" The 2016 tournament saw a total of 11 upsets; 8 of them were in the first round, 2 of them were in the second round, none in the Sweet Sixteen, and one in the Elite Eight.\nMedia coverage.\nTelevision.\nCBS Sports and Turner Sports held joint U.S. television broadcast rights to the Tournament under the \"NCAA March Madness\" brand. Beginning in 2016, rights to the Final Four and championship game began to alternate between Turner and CBS, with Turner networks broadcasting the 2016 Final Four and championship; a conventional telecast aired on TBS, accompanied by \"Team Stream\" broadcasts on TNT and TruTV which featured commentary and coverage focused on each participating team. Turner employed this multi-channel presentation of the semifinals in 2014 and 2015, but this was the first time it was used for the final. It marked the first time in tournament history that the national championship game aired on cable channels, and ended CBS' streak of broadcasting 34 consecutive National Championship games. However, Turner allowed the tournament's closing theme, \"One Shining Moment\", to be played for the 30th year in a row. To date, the song is still played in this manner, no matter which network airs the National Championship game.\nFor 2016, the selection show on CBS was expanded into a two-hour broadcast—a move which proved unpopular with viewers due to the decreased speed at which the participating teams were unveiled. These issues were exacerbated by a leak of the full bracket shortly into the broadcast, which spread on Twitter. Although ratings for the selection show had steadily decreased over the past four years, the 3.7 overnight rating for the broadcast was the lowest in 20 years. CBS Sports chairman Sean McManus admitted that the extended special was a failure, stating that \"we haven't had any specific discussions but I think we all agree it would serve all of us well including the fan to release the brackets in a little more timely manner\".\nRadio.\nWestwood One had exclusive radio rights to the entire tournament.\nInternet.\nThe games were streamed on the NCAA March Madness Live website and app, with streams for Turner games also available on the Bleacher Report website and Team Stream app, and CBS games available on the CBS Sports website and app.\nGames on TBS were available on Watch TBS app. Games on TNT were made available on Watch TNT app. Games on TruTV were available on Watch TruTV app. Westwood One's radio broadcasts, including a \"National Mix\" channel consisting of whip-around coverage during the first and second rounds, was available on its website and on the TuneIn app.\nThe games were also viewable on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita and Xbox One video game consoles via the PlayStation Vue (PS3/PS4; all games), Sling TV (XB1; TBS, TNT, TruTV games) and TuneIn (Vita/XB1; all games) apps."

        "text": "Gregory Paul Bird (born November 9, 1992) is an American professional baseball first baseman for the Charros de Jalisco of the Mexican League. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees.\nSince Bird’s 2015 debut season, his career has been plagued by a variety of injuries. Bird missed the entire 2016 campaign and played a mere 173 games with the Yankees and their respective minor league affiliates, between 2017 and 2019.\nAmateur career.\nBird attended Grandview High School in Aurora, Colorado, where he played for the baseball team as a catcher and formed a battery with pitcher Kevin Gausman. Bird was named the Colorado Gatorade Baseball Player of the Year as a senior. He committed to attend the University of Arkansas to play college baseball for the Arkansas Razorbacks.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nBird was drafted by the New York Yankees in the fifth round of the 2011 Major League Baseball Draft. Bird signed with the Yankees, receiving a $1.1 million signing bonus and bypassing his commitment to Arkansas. He was drafted as a catcher but was moved to first base.\nBird made his professional debut for the Gulf Coast Yankees in 2011. He finished the season playing in four games, going 1 for 12. In 2012, he played in only 28 games due to injuries. He finished the season hitting .337/.450/.494 with two home runs. Bird started the 2013 season with the Charleston RiverDogs of the Single–A South Atlantic League. He finished the season, hitting .288/.428/.511 with 20 home runs and a minor league leading 107 walks. He won the Kevin Lawn Award as the Yankees Minor League Player of the Year.\nIn 2014, Bird began the season with the Tampa Yankees of the High–A Florida State League, where he batted .277 with seven home runs and 32 runs batted in before he was promoted tor the Trenton Thunder of the Double–A Eastern League, where he batted for a .253/.379/.558 triple slash to go along with seven homers and 11 RBI to create a full season equaling .271/.376/.472 slash line, 14 homers, and 43 RBI in 102 games. After the season, the Yankees assigned Bird to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League (AFL). He hit a home run during the AFL Fall Stars Game. Bird led the AFL with six home runs was named the AFL Most Valuable Player.\nBird started the 2015 season with Double-A Trenton and was promoted to the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Triple–A International League during the season. In May, he experienced a shoulder injury.\nMajor leagues.\n2015: Rookie season.\nOn August 13, 2015, the Yankees announced that they would promote Bird to the major leagues, serving as a backup to Mark Teixeira at first base and Alex Rodriguez at designated hitter. He made his major league debut that night, going 0-for-5. He collected his first hit on August 15, a single off of Toronto Blue Jays reliever LaTroy Hawkins. Teixeira injured his leg during a hit-by-pitch on August 17, which was later diagnosed as a season-ending shin fracture. As a result, Bird became the Yankees' starting first baseman for the rest of 2015.\nOn August 19, Bird hit his first two MLB home runs off of Minnesota Twins pitcher Ervin Santana. On September 7, Bird hit a go-ahead three-run home run in a game against the Baltimore Orioles. On September 22, Bird hit a game winning three-run home run against the Toronto Blue Jays in the top of the tenth inning. He finished the season with a .261 batting average and a .343 on-base percentage. In 46 games and 157 at-bats, Bird hit 11 home runs with 31 RBIs.\n2016.\nBird suffered a recurrence of his right shoulder injury during the 2015-16 offseason, which was diagnosed as a torn labrum. Bird underwent successful surgery, and was ruled out for the entire 2016 MLB season. After not playing during the regular season, Bird recovered from his shoulder injury in time to be assigned to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League in October 2016.\n2017.\nIn spring training, Bird showed a full recovery from his season-ending shoulder surgery, hitting eight home runs, tied for the most with Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper. He also led the league in extra-base hits (16), on-base percentage (.556), slugging percentage (1.098) and OPS (1.654). During an exhibition game against the Atlanta Braves, Bird hit the first-ever home run in SunTrust Park.\nOn May 2, Bird was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a bruised right ankle. His performance was hampered due to an injury he sustained after fouling a ball of his foot at the end of Spring Training, batting .100 in 19 games. In July, Bird was diagnosed with an injury to the os trigonum in his right foot; he would have surgery to remove the bone. On August 26, Bird was activated off the 60-day DL after missing 103 games and went 1-for-2 with two walks in a game that afternoon. Since his return from injury, Bird batted .253 and hit 8 home runs. In 48 games played in 2017, Bird batted .190 with 9 home runs and 28 RBI.\nIn Game 3 of the ALDS, Bird hit a solo home run off of Cleveland Indians reliever and former Yankee Andrew Miller, only the second home run Miller had allowed on a fastball to a lefty in the last three seasons. It was the only run scored in the game as the Yankees won 1–0. Bird served as the final out in Game 7 of the ALCS against the Houston Astros, flying out to center fielder George Springer to eliminate the Yankees from World Series contention. In the postseason, Bird slashed .244/.426/.512 with three home runs and 6 RBIs; he was also thrown out at home plate twice.\n2018.\nOn March 26, 2018, it was revealed that Bird would undergo ankle surgery, ruling him out for six to eight weeks. He underwent successful surgery the next day, and it was revealed to be a small bone spur. A coin-sized calcium deposit was also removed from the ankle. This was the second time Bird had ankle surgery; a different problematic bone was removed from the ankle the previous summer. Bird returned from his ankle surgery on May 26, 2018. Bird struggled in 2018 batting .199/.286/.386 with 11 home runs and 38 RBIs and lost his starting job to Luke Voit late in the season.\n2019.\nOn April 16, Bird was placed on the 10-day IL with a left plantar fascia tear, prompting the Yankees to call up first baseman Mike Ford. He was transferred to the 60-day IL on May 12. Bird would go on to miss the rest of the 2019 season. Bird finished the season hitting .171 in 35 at bats.\nOn November 20, 2019, the Yankees designated Bird for assignment. He became a free agent on November 27.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn February 4, 2020, Bird signed a minor league deal with the Texas Rangers.\nOn July 31, 2020, Bird was brought back to MLB once he was recalled by the Texas Rangers. Bird suffered an injury before he could appear in a game, and was designated for assignment on August 11 without ever playing as a Ranger. Bird elected free agency on August 14 after being outrighted to the minors.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn September 15, 2020, Bird signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies organization.\nColorado Rockies.\nOn February 11, 2021, Bird signed a minor league contract with the Colorado Rockies organization that included an invitation to Spring Training.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nOn March 10, 2022, Bird signed a minor league contract with the Toronto Blue Jays.

        "text": "The 2013–14 Rugby-Bundesliga was the 43rd edition of this competition and the 94th edition of the German rugby union championship. In the Rugby-Bundesliga, twenty-four teams played in, initially, four regional divisions, the first stage of the competition, followed by a championship round of sixteen clubs and, finally, the play-offs consisting of twelve teams. The season started on 24 August 2013 and finished with the championship final on 21 June 2014 in Pforzheim, interrupted by a winter break from 8 December to 22 February. The regular season finished on 19 April and the play-offs started on 3 May, with the German championship final held on 21 June 2014, which was contested between TV Pforzheim and Heidelberger RK. Heidelberg won its fifth consecutive national championship when it defeated Pforzheim 43–20 in the final.\nThe defending champions were Heidelberger RK who defeated SC Neuenheim in the 2013 final to take out its ninth championship and fourth in a row. Heidelberger RK remained unbeaten throughout the 2013–14 regular season, as it had been all throughout the 2012–13 Rugby-Bundesliga season, having last lost in the Bundesliga on 1 November 2011, when \"HRK\" was beaten 26–24 by TV Pforzheim.\nOverview.\nThe league saw only minor changes compare to the previous season, playing at full strength of 24 clubs in 2013–14 instead of only 22. Promoted to the league were 08 Ricklingen/Wunstorf, TuS 95 Düsseldorf and Veltener RC while RC Luxembourg had withdrawn from the competition.\nThe first stage of the competition, the \"Vorrunde\", saw four six-team groupes in which each team played the other five just once. This stage finished in late September after which the second stage started, the \"Qualifikationsphase\", in which the top teams each from the southern and the western group play each other in one group while the top teams from the north and east play each other in another. A new addition compare to the previous season was that the fourth placed team from each division would play the fifth placed in the opposite group to determine the last two places in the second round. The six teams not qualified for the \"Qualifikationsphase\" entered the \"DRV-Pokal\", the German rugby union cup, together with the top eight teams of the 2nd Bundesliga. The 2nd Bundesliga teams not qualified for the \"DRV-Pokal\" in turn played for the \"Liga Pokal\".\nIn the second stage the teams within a group would play each other in a home-and-away format, with the teams that already played each other in the first stage carrying over those results. Of the sixteen clubs the best six in each group now qualified for the knock-out stage. The knock-out stage was played in a single-game format with the higher seeded team enjoying home advantage and the winner advancing to the next round.\nBundesliga tables &amp; results.\nFirst stage.\nIn the first stage twenty-four clubs played in four groups. Within each group each team played the other just once. The best three teams advanced directly to the second stage while the teams placed fourth and fifth had to play a qualifying decider.\nNorth.\nThe division table:\nEast.\nThe division table:\nWest.\nThe division table:\nSouth.\nThe division table:\nQualifying matches.\nFour qualifying matches were held to determine the last four clubs to enter the second stage. The fourth placed club in the southern division played the fifth placed team in the western division and the fourth placed western club the fifth placed southern team. The same system applied to the northern and eastern division. The winners of the four games advanced to the second stage while the losers had to enter the \"DRV-Pokal\".\nSecond stage.\nIn the second stage sixteen clubs played in two groups of eight clubs each. Within each group each team played the others home and away except for the match-ups that already had been played in the first round. The results of those were carried over. The best six teams in each group qualified for the play-offs and were seeded according to the final standings.\nNorth-East.\nThe division table:\nSouth-West.\nThe division table:\nPlay-off stage.\nIn the play-offs the twelve qualified teams played four rounds. The best two clubs in each division received a bye for the first round and entered in the quarter-finals stage. The first round was played on 26 April, with one game held a week later. The quarter finals were held on 3 May, except one game which was held on 10 May. The semi finals were held on 17 May, followed by a break of over one month before the final was played on 21 June:\n\"DRV-Pokal\" tables &amp; results.\nThe eight worst clubs in the first stage of the Bundesliga entered the \"DRV-Pokal\" for 2013–14, together with the eight best clubs from the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga. The \"DRV-Pokal\" ranks as a second tier to the German championship but also functioned as a qualifying competition for the 2014–15 Rugby-Bundesliga. The modus for the \"DRV-Pokal\" was the same as for the German championship, with a second stage with two divisions of eight teams, followed by the play-offs made up of the best twelve teams, with the top two in each division receiving a bye for the first round.\nGroup stage.\nNorth-East.\nThe division table:\nSouth-West.\nThe division table:\nPlay-off stage.\nThe 2013–14 final was played on 28 June 2014 in Rottweil. The play-offs for the \"DRV-Pokal\" started on 10 May 2014.

        "title": "Swimming With Dolphins (band)",
        "text": "Swimming With Dolphins is an American electronica band from Minneapolis, Minnesota. The band formed in 2008 by Austin Tofte and Owl City frontman Adam Young. The name of the band was derived, according to Tofte, from \"some old Jacques Cousteau documentaries from the 80s\". The group is fronted by Tofte, while Young performed synths and programming for the act and additionally served as the producer of the group.\nFor the act, Tofte and Young created trademark outfits. Tofte took on the appearance of a submariner wearing a classic scuba suit and Young donned a pilot's mask (which would later become Sky Sailing's trademark look).\nHistory.\nThe band made its debut with the release of their 2008 EP, \"Ambient Blue\". The EP was produced by Young and sold over 9,000 digital copies. The song \"Silhouettes\", off the release, featured Breanne Düren. In addition to the main release, the band also put out a cover version of Tracy Chapman's \"Fast Car\" as B-sides single to the EP. \nYoung departed the band in late 2008 as Owl City's popularity began to increase. Alone, Tofte signed Swimming With Dolphins on to Tooth &amp; Nail Records in June 2010. Recording for the album began in the summer of 2010 where it was produced by Aaron Sprinkle in Seattle. The album finished production in Atlanta with help from producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount. The debut album titled, \"Water Colours\" was set to be released in March 2011 but was pushed two months back. It was officially released on May 17, 2011. On August 5, 2011, Swimming With Dolphins uploaded the official music video for the first single off the record, \"Sleep To Dream\", via YouTube.\nAfter Young's departure, Tofte was joined by Sarah Beintker and Torrie James as part of his live band. Beinker contributed her vocals to the songs \"Holiday\" and \"Sleep To Dream\" off \"Water Colours\". The release also featured the artists Sunsun and Mod Sun. Swimming With Dolphins joined Abandon Kansas on a Spring Tour that began in March 2011. In support of his album, \"Water Colours\", he joined Family Force 5 for the Tourantula tour during April and May 2011.\nAfter the release of his debut album, Tofte had parted ways with Tooth &amp; Nail and started to release music independently. In August 2013, Tofte launched an Indiegogo campaign to fund the project's upcoming album, \"Catharsis\". The funding needed $12,000 in mixing and mastering the album, as well as creating an album cover art, among many more. In September 2013, Tofte announced that the campaign had been successful and would begin working on the album. That same month, Tofte did an interview with Chris Herlihy's weekly syndicated radio show and talked about the release. In a separate interview with Blue Freedom, Tofte stated that, \"\"Catharsis\" is a cleansing and redemptive effort.\" He also believed he had \"missed the mark\" with his previous album release. Also in September, Swimming With Dolphins released a preview of the new album in the form of a single instrumental track, entitled \"Tromsø\", via SoundCloud. Swimming With Dolphins also posted a video for \"Tromsø\" via Vimeo around the same time. \nAccording to Tofte in 2014, the album was very near completion. On August 21, Tofte stated that the track listing for the album would be revealed shortly. On August 29, Tofte released the raw rough draft of the track listing for the album as well as the cover art for a single entitled \"Summer Skin\", which is to be on the album. On September 23, \"Summer Skin\" was released to Swimming With Dolphins' SoundCloud. On December 18, Tofte announced that a big update on \"Catharsis\" was to be released soon. On May 1, 2015, Tofte revealed the album art for \"Catharsis\" as well as its release date of August 4, 2015. Tofte instead released the single \"Iron Lungs\" instead, saying he needed to \"take a step back to recalibrate and determine a new release date\" due to the premature announcement.\nOn January 11, 2016, to celebrate \"Iron Lungs\" hitting 5,000 streams on SoundCloud, Tofte released a reworked version of \"Summer Skin\" for the final version of \"Catharsis\". On May 6, he released a new single, \"Let You Love.\" On April 1, 2018, after an over year-long hiatus from making music, Tofte released a sample of \"Roller Dancer\", which will be released on \"Catharsis\". As of January 2023, the album still has no release date.\nBesides Swimming With Dolphins, Tofte was also a member of Owl City's live touring band in 2008.\nMusical style and influences.\nSwimming with Dolphins' music has been described as ambient, electropop, indie-pop and synth-pop. Their debut EP, \"Ambient Blue\" is a lot more experimental as the group works with synthesizers and features upbeat dance songs. Their debut studio album, \"Water Colours\", was influenced by 80s' synth-pop music.\nAccolades.\n\"Cross Rhythms\" named \"Water Colours\" as one of the 20 best albums of 2011.\nBand members.\nCurrent members\nFormer members\nFormer touring musicians"

        "title": "2014 Maria Sharapova tennis season",
        "text": "The 2014 Maria Sharapova tennis season officially began on 30 December 2013 with the start of the 2014 WTA Tour. Sharapova began the season, having only played one match since the previous June due to a shoulder injury, at the Brisbane International. After failing to defend her points during the winter and spring hard court season, Sharapova almost dropped out of the Top 10. She rebounded by dominating the clay court season which saw her win Stuttgart, Madrid and the French Open. Her only loss on clay came to a resurgent Ana Ivanovic. She then won her first hard court title since the 2013 BNP Paribas Open at the China Open. Her season ended on 24 October 2014 following her elimination from the round robin stage at the 2014 WTA Finals in Singapore. She ended the year ranked no. 2 behind Serena Williams.\nYear in detail.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nBrisbane International.\nSharapova began her season at the Brisbane International, having pulled out of the event in the previous two seasons. Her comeback began with a straightforward 6–3, 6–0 win over Caroline Garcia. She then received a walkover before her second round match with home favourite Ashleigh Barty, with Barty citing a left adductor tear as reason for her withdrawal. In the quarterfinals, Sharapova played world #30 Kaia Kanepi and prevailed in three sets, having lost the opener to the Estonian. Sharapova's run ended in the semifinals with a 6–2, 7–6 (7) defeat to world #1 Serena Williams. The defeat was Sharapova's fourteenth consecutive defeat to Williams, a run stretching back to 2004. Despite the defeat, Sharapova's world ranking climbed slightly to world #3, overtaking Li Na.\nAustralian Open.\nSharapova's next tournament was the first major of the year, the Australian Open, an event she had previously won in 2008. She was seeded third and was defending heavy points from the previous years semifinal, which she lost in straight sets to Li Na. Sharapova began her title bid against American Bethanie Mattek-Sands and prevailed 6–3, 6–4. She then faced Italian Karin Knapp in the second round and ultimately won 6–4, 4–6, 10–8, in a match that lasted for almost three and a half hours. Following the match, the tournament was criticized from some quarters, for allowing the match to continue under the closed roof on Rod Laver Arena, despite play being stopped on all other courts due to the tournaments Extreme Heat policy. Sharapova later played down the complaints stating \"I think you just get numb to [the heat], it just doesn't faze you any more. I'm happy – these are the matches that you work for.\" Next, Sharapova had a much easier time in the third round, defeating French 25th seed Alizé Cornet in straight sets 6–1, 7–6. Her run however came to an end in the fourth round, when she lost in three sets to the Slovakian 20th seed (and eventual finalist) Dominika Cibulková. Sharapova had won the first set 6–3, but then lost the next two sets to be eliminated from the competition. Sharapova's ranking fell two places to world #5 after the tournament.\nParis Open GDF Suez.\nFollowing defeat at the Australian Open, Sharapova entered the Premier level Open GDF Suez in Paris as the top seed. Her confectionery venture \"Sugarpova\" was one of the tournaments primary sponsors. She began the event with a straightforward 6–0, 6–1 victory over world #31 Daniela Hantuchová, her ninth consecutive win over the Slovak after losing their opening meeting in 2004. She then progressed through the quarterfinals with a 6–2, 6–2 win over Kirsten Flipkens, before losing to compatriot and eventual champion Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the semifinal match. Sharapova had again won the first set, before Pavlyuchenkova came back to win in three, to claim her first career victory over Sharapova. Sharapova's ranking remained steady at world #5 after the event.\nBNP Paribas Open.\nAfter not playing during the month of February, Sharapova returned to action at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California. She was the defending champion at the event, having beaten Caroline Wozniacki 6–2, 6–2 in the 2013 final. As the fourth seed, Sharapova received a bye in the first round and thus began her title defence in the second round, facing German world #86 Julia Görges. Sharapova made short work of her opponent, winning 6–1, 6–4. In the third round, Sharapova faced 22-year-old qualifier Camila Giorgi for the first time in her career. Despite being the heavy favourite to progress, Sharapova was stunned by Giorgi in three sets, losing the defence of her title 3–6, 6–4, 5–7. The early defeat proved costly for Sharapova's ranking, which dropped two further places to world #7 after the event.\n2014 Sony Open Tennis.\nAfter her early loss at Indian Wells, Sharapova looked to bounce back at the Sony Open Tennis event in Key Biscayne, Florida. Sharapova entered the tournament having been the beaten finalist on five previous occasions, including the last three editions of the competition, losing against Victoria Azarenka, Agnieszka Radwańska and Serena Williams respectively. Despite her ranking having dropped to #7, she entered the tournament as the fourth seed and again received a bye to the second round. There, Sharapova played her first career meeting with Japan's Kurumi Nara and won in straight sets 6–3, 6–4, to set up a third round match against world #26 Lucie Šafářová. Though Sharapova failed to convert two match points in the second set (and eight overall), she eventually overcame her Czech opponent on her ninth match point, winning 6–4, 6–7, 6–2 to advance to the fourth round. She next faced Kirsten Flipkens, and despite never previously losing a set to her opponent (including at their previous 2014 meeting in Paris), she lost the first set 3–6. However, Sharapova then regrouped and won the following two sets 6–4, 6–1 to advance the quarterfinals. There, Sharapova earned her first top ten victory of the year, seeing off world #8 Petra Kvitová 7–5, 6–1, to set up a semifinal rematch against Serena Williams. However, despite making a strong start, Sharapova once again fell foul of the world #1, losing 6–4, 6–3. The defeat was Sharapova's third semifinal loss of 2014, each to the eventual winner of the tournament. Sharapova again dropped slightly in the rankings to world #9, her lowest position since returning to the top 10 in 2011.\nSpring clay court season and French Open.\nPorsche Tennis Grand Prix.\nSharapova began her clay court season at the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart, Germany. She entered the tournament having never previously lost at the event, and as the two-time defending champion following her victories over Victoria Azarenka and Li Na in the 2012 and 2013 finals respectively. Seeded sixth, Sharapova began her campaign facing Lucie Šafářová for the second time in 2014, and their match proved just as dramatic as their previous encounter in Key Biscayne, with Sharapova ultimately prevailing in three hours and twenty four minutes, 7–6, 6–7, 7–6, having previously being two points from defeat in the final set. The second round proved to be far more straightforward for Sharapova, as she beat Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6–4, 6–3 to avenge her earlier defeat to the Russian in Paris. In the subsequent quarterfinals, Sharapova beat top seed and world #3 Agnieszka Radwańska in straight sets, and then advanced to her third consecutive Stuttgart final by comfortably beating Sara Errani 6–1, 6–2 in the semifinals, setting up a title decider with world #12 Ana Ivanovic. The match was the first final to be contested between the pair since the 2008 Australian Open, won by Sharapova. Ivanovic started the final strong, winning the first set 6–3 and taking a 3–1 lead in the second, however Sharapova then recovered, winning 11 of the remaining 13 games to claim her third consecutive title at Stuttgart with a 3–6, 6–4, 6–1 win. The victory secured Sharapova's first title of the year, and the first since her previous visit to the event. Stuttgart is the first title that Sharapova has ever won on three occasions in her career.\nMutua Madrid Open.\nNext, Sharapova traveled to Spain, for the Mutua Madrid Open, a Premier Mandatory event. She entered the tournament as the eighth seed, defending finalist points after her defeat to Serena Williams in the 2013 title decider. Following a comfortable first round victory over Klára Koukalová, Sharapova was forced to rally from a 1–4 deficit in the final set against Christina McHale in the second round, eventually prevailing 6–1, 4–6, 6–4. In the third round, Sharapova continued her dominance over Australian Samantha Stosur, earning a 6–4, 6–3 victory, her twelfth over Stosur in fourteen career meetings. Sharapova was once again involved in a narrow three setter in her quarterfinal match, beating world #2 Li Na 2–6, 7–6, 6–3. She then beat Agnieszka Radwańska 6–1, 6–4 in the semifinal, to earn a berth in the Madrid final for the second time in a row. This time she faced world #5 Simona Halep for the title, but started slowly, losing the first set 6–1. From there however, Sharapova slowly regained her dominance in the game, and eventually came out the victor, earning her first Madrid title and her second overall in 2014 with a 1–6, 6–2, 6–3 victory. Following the match, Sharapova's world ranking recovered slightly back to world #7. She remains unbeaten on clay in 2014 and is currently on an eleven match winning streak.\nInternazionali BNL d'Italia.\nAiming for her third consecutive title, and to keep her unbeaten clay court record alive, Sharapova went to Italy to contest in the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, a Premier 5 tournament. As she entered the tournament as the eighth seed, she had a bye in the first round. Sharapova struggled through her second round match against Monica Puig, coming back from a 2–1 deficit in the first set and a 4–1 deficit in the second to win the match 6–3, 7–5. In the third round, Sharapova faced eleventh seed Ana Ivanovic, who she defeated in Stuttgart. Despite Sharapova winning their last six meetings, she lost to Ivanovic 1–6, 4–6.\nFrench Open.\nSharapova was seeded seventh at this year French Open. She played Ksenia Pervak, Tsvetana Pironkova and Paula Ormaechea in the opening rounds, and dominated all three matches in straight sets, including a \"double bagel\" over Ormaechea. In round four Sharapova played Australian 19th seed Samantha Stosur. She dropped the first set and found herself 3–4 down in the second, before improving and winning all nine of the remaining games. In the quarter-final, Sharapova faced Garbiñe Muguruza who had knocked out Serena Williams in the second round. Sharapova started slowly, losing the first set 1–6 and being broken in the second set. However, she again made a late comeback and came out the 1–6, 7–5, 6–1 winner, to set up a fourth consecutive French Open semifinal. Here, she played Eugenie Bouchard, the 18th seed. For a third consecutive match, she came from a set down to win the match 4–6 7–5 6–2. In the grand final, her opponent was Romanian 4th seed, and Grand Slam final debutante, Simona Halep. In what was later described as one of the best Grand Slam finals in years, Sharapova claimed the first set 6–4, before losing the second set tiebreak to Halep. Despite struggling early in the third set, Sharapova's experience prevailed and after over three hours, she emerged victorious with a 6–4, 6–7, 6–4 win, claiming her fifth Grand Slam title, and second at the French Open. After the tournament, Sharapova's ranking improved to World #5, and she also claimed top spot in the WTA's \"Road to Singapore\" leaderboard. Following the early end to her 2013 season, Sharapova additionally only has 101 points to defend until the end of the year.\nGrasscourt Season.\nWimbledon.\nSharapova was seeded fifth at this year Wimbledon, defending second round points after her shock defeat to Michelle Larcher de Brito in 2013. She quickly improved on her previous result, with quick wins over local wildcard Samantha Murray and qualifier Timea Bacsinszky. She then continued her strong start over grass-court specialist Alison Riske 6–3, 6–0 to set up a fourth round clash with world #7 Angelique Kerber to whom she lost 6–7 6–4 4–6 after saving six match points in the final set.\nUS Open Series &amp; US Open.\nRogers Cup.\nSharapova began the 2014 US Open Series at the Rogers Cup, where she gained a top 4 seeding for the first time since the Sony Open in March, by virtue of Li Na's withdrawal from the tournament with a knee injury. Receiving a bye through the first round, Maria opened up her campaign against Garbiñe Muguruza, whom she had defeated in the quarterfinals of Roland Garros earlier in the year. Following a quick start by her opponent, which saw Sharapova fall behind a set and a break, Maria broke back in the fourth game of the second set and won eleven of the last thirteen games to win the match 4–6, 6–3, 6–1. In her third round match, Sharapova faced Muguruza's doubles partner Carla Suárez Navarro. Another slow start saw Sharapova fall into a quick 0–5 deficit in the first set and although she was able to hold and break Suárez Navarro's serve for 2–5, Carla broke to win the first set 2–6. Sharapova was twice a break down in the second set at 0–2 and 1–3 but she broke back both times and leveled the match by winning the set 6–4. The match had been littered with rain delays and the final one of the match saw Sharapova come out to another slow start in the third set, which Sharapova consequently lost 2–6. This was Maria's first loss to Suárez Navarro, tying their head-to-head at one apiece.\nWestern &amp; Southern Open.\nSharapova next participated at the tournament in Cincinnati, where she was previously the champion in 2011. Sharapova was seeded fifth, and advanced to the quarterfinals with wins over Madison Keys and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. She then earned her third win of 2014 against world #2 Simona Halep in a lengthy three set match. In the semifinals, Sharapova met Ana Ivanovic for the third time in the year. Despite coming back from a set down, Sharapova missed two match points in the final set and went on to lose 2–6, 7–5, 5–7.\nUS Open.\nSharapova was seeded 5th at the final Grand Slam of the year. She comfortably dispatched of compatriot Maria Kirilenko in the first round, before advancing again, this time in three sets over Romanian Alexandra Dulgheru. In the third round, Sharapova defeated 26th seed Sabine Lisicki in straight sets to set up a fourth round tie against tenth seed Caroline Wozniacki, but lost there to the eventual finalist, 4–6, 6–2, 2–6.\nAsian hard court season.\nWuhan Open.\nAfter almost a month of inactivity, Sharapova returned to the tour at the inaugural tournament at Wuhan. As the fourth seed, she received a bye in the first round, before facing Svetlana Kuznetsova for the first time in over three years, defeating her compatriot in three sets. Her run at the tournament came to an abrupt end in the next round, when she was stunned by world #61 Timea Bacsinszky in two close sets.\nChina Open.\nSharapova next played at the China Open in Beijing, her first return to the event since defeat at the hands of Victoria Azarenka in the 2012 final. She quickly advanced to the quarterfinals without dropping a set, defeating Kaia Kanepi, Elina Svitolina and avenging her Montreal defeat to Carla Suárez Navarro. She then defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova for the second time in two weeks, this time at the loss of only four games, to claim a semifinal berth against Ana Ivanovic. Despite enduring a lengthy final service game that contained three aces and four double faults, Sharapova emerged in straight sets 6–0, 6–4, to tie her 2014 rivalry with Ivanovic at two wins apiece. In the final, Sharapova faced world #3 Petra Kvitová. She was broken in the very first game of the match, but rebounded to claim the first set 6–4. Kvitová then upped her game to claim the second set, but Sharapova rebounded in the final set, claiming a 6–4, 2–6, 6–3 victory and her fourth tournament win of the year. The victory, her first at Beijing, was her first tournament victory on a hard court since Indian Wells in 2013, and her four titles of the year represented her best haul since winning five titles in 2006.\nWTA Finals.\nSharapova's final event of the year came at the 2014 WTA Finals, held in Singapore for the first time. As the second seed, she was placed in the White Group alongside Petra Kvitová, Agnieszka Radwańska and Caroline Wozniacki. Sharapova started the tournament poorly, losing in three sets to Wozniacki before being pushed to the brink of elimination after a straight sets defeat to Kvitová. In spite of losing her first two matches, Sharapova entered her final match against Radwańska still able to qualify for the semifinals, provided that she won in straight sets, while Wozniacki did the same against Kvitová. Despite taking a commanding 7–5, 5–1 lead against Radwańska, Sharapova was unable to convert three match points and ultimately lost the second set on a tiebreak, eliminating her from the tournament. She went on to win the deciding set to earn her first round-robin win, but the result wasn't enough to see her into the semifinals. In the following match, Wozniacki beat Kvitová 6–2, 6–3, meaning that Sharapova would have progressed had she won the second set. In spite of the round-robin elimination, Sharapvoa retained her ranking position, finishing 2014 ranked second behind Serena Williams.\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by number of wins"

        "text": "\"Stan's World Cup Song\", also known as \"Aye Aye Ippy The Germans Bombed Our Chippy\", is a song by English comedian Stan Boardman. It is set to the tune of \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\" and the Dambusters March. It was released to coincide with the 2006 FIFA World Cup.\nHistory.\nBoardman came up with the idea of writing his own World Cup song because he thought that some of them were \"lousy\". He then wrote the song and designed a CD cover for it and contacted a friend of his to help record it. The song was first performed in Liverpool on 28 April 2006. Boardman stated that if the song made it to no. 1 in the UK charts, he would donate half of the profits to charity. The song's line \"The Germans bombed our chippy\" was based on a real incident when Boardman's local fish and chip shop was destroyed by a bomb dropped by the Luftwaffe in the Liverpool Blitz.\nCharts.\nThe song was released in late May 2006. It made its debut in the UK Singles Chart at 19 before rising to 15 the next week. The song initially placed above England's official World Cup song World at Your Feet. In the UK Indie Chart, the song reached number 1 in the week beginning 5 June 2006.\nReception.\nThe Football Association received the song negatively because they didn't want to support any song perceived as \"anti-German\". It was reported that Liverpool players Jamie Carragher and Steven Gerrard with former Liverpool player, Michael Owen sang the song during an England national football team training camp coach. Singer Tony Christie described the song as \"just a vehicle for Stan and his German 'jokes'\". In 2010, Boardman released an updated version of Stan's World Cup Song entitled \"Stan's World Cup Song – Africa 2010\" for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with the CD sales going to Help for Heroes."

        "title": "Ladies' Scottish Climbing Club",
        "text": "The Ladies' Scottish Climbing Club was founded by Jane Inglis Clark, her daughter Mabel, and Lucy Smith at a boulder near Lix Toll, Perthshire in 1908. It now has about 120 members and is the oldest active climbing club exclusively for women. The club has sent numerous expeditions abroad and made the first all-woman climb of a major peak in the Himalayas.\nFounding.\nThe club was founded by three experienced climbers: Jane Inglis Clark, her daughter Mabel, and Lucy Smith. Miss Smith was the daughter of a president of the Scottish Mountaineering Club and Mrs Inglis Clark's husband William Inglis Clark was secretary, but as women they were not allowed to join the all-male club. The Ladies' Alpine Club had been formed in London in 1907 and so, while sheltering by a large boulder at Lix Toll on 18 April 1908, the three decided to form a similar club in Scotland. A committee meeting was held in May which established the club's constitution and purpose: \"to bring together Ladies who are lovers of mountain-climbing, and to encourage mountaineering in Scotland, in winter as well as in summer.\" The first president of the club was Mrs Inglis Clark while Lucy Smith was treasurer, Miss Inglis Clark was secretary, and Ruth Raeburn the librarian.\nDevelopment.\nIn its first year, the club had fourteen members. Its equipment included alpine rope which had been fixed to the Cobbler and the Salisbury Crags in Edinburgh where the members trained. To qualify, members had to ascend four peaks of at least 3,000 feet with two snow climbs and two rock climbs. They then went on bold climbs of mountains such as the Beuckle (\"Buachaille Etive Mòr\") and Suilven. To be decent, they would start their climbs in long skirts but, when no men were around, would often discard these to climb in knickerbockers. They attracted climbers from Glasgow too and the total membership in the early years was about 70. In 1947, the club took a lease on its first climbing hut—Blackrock Cottage near Glencoe—and the second was added in 1963—Milehouse Cottage near Kincraig. From these and other bases, numerous Scottish mountains were climbed and member Annie Hirst was the first woman to climb all the Munros—the 282 Scottish peaks higher than 3,000 feet.\nExpeditions.\nIn 1928, a club expedition to the Alps was organised. Subsequent expeditions were made to other climbing regions abroad such as the Caucasus and Yosemite. In 1955, the club made the first all-woman team expedition to the Himalayas, made up of Monica Jackson, Evelyn McNicol and Elizabeth Stark, where they were the first to climb a 22,000-foot peak in the Jugal Himal which they named Gyalgen \"Peak\". Since then many club expeditions have been made including: Greenland in 1970 &amp;1998, regular Alpine trips since the mid 1990's, the Himalayas in 2000 and Bolivia in 2008. \nAnniversaries.\nIn 1958, the first secretary made a speech upon the club's 50th anniversary as its president. Mabel Jeffrey was now married and brought her grandchildren to the celebrations at the site of the club's founding at the boulder at Lix Toll.\nIn 2008, the centenary was celebrated with a party of the membership in period costume on top of the Beuckle. President Helen Steven recalled the youngest founder, \"I knew Mabel and remember her as very warm, rosy-cheeked and welcoming – she came into a room like a burst of sunshine. But she was hard as old nails. They were all characters...\" The Club returned to Lix Toll and the boulder now surrounded by trees to more celebrations. "

The team played its home games in Ann Arbor, Michigan for the 48th consecutive year at the Crisler Center, which has a capacity of 12,707. This season marked the program's 99th season and its 98th consecutive year as a member of the Big Ten Conference. The team was led by 8th year head coach John Beilein, who was voted 2014 Big Ten Coach of the Year by the Big Ten media. The 2013–14 team was Big Ten champion, earning the school's first outright title since 1986. The program entered the season coming off its winningest two-year stretch, having won 59 games in the two previous seasons. The team was also coming off four consecutive NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament appearances.\nThe 2014–15 team needed to replace the losses of Nik Stauskas, Mitch McGary and Glenn Robinson III to the 2014 NBA draft and Jon Horford and Jordan Morgan to graduation.

Guard Caris LeVert was named a preseason All-American according to numerous media outlets and preseason All-Big Ten according to the Big Ten media.

On April 25, Mitch McGary declared for the draft. He was facing a season-long NCAA suspension after testing positive for marijuana after the Wolverines' NCAA tournament win over Tennessee, a game for which he dressed but was not able to play. When all three players were drafted, it marked the first time Michigan had at least three draft picks since the 1990 NBA draft.\n2014–15 team recruits.\nAfter Stauskas and Robinson declared for the NBA, Michigan signed Muhammad Ali Abdur-Rahkman on April 19. On April 28, Michigan signed Aubrey Dawkins, son of former Duke Naismith College Player of the Year, National Basketball Association point guard and Stanford head coach Johnny Dawkins.\nFuture recruits.\nOn August 6, Duncan Robinson announced that he would transfer to Michigan with three years of eligibility remaining and sit out the 2014–15 season after Division III Williams College head coach Mike Maker announced his departure to coach at Marist.

Sports, 14 by Bleacher Report, 17 by ESPN, 18 by \"USA Today\", 20 by NBC Sports and CBS Sports. Following the April 27 NBA draft entry deadline, revised predictions had Michigan a little lower: 19 by Bleacher Report, 24 by ESPN and NBC Sports, unranked by CBS Sports and \"USA Today\". Despite the projected rankings the Las Vegas 2015 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament betting lines showed only 11 schools with shorter odds than Michigan who was in a 6-way tie for 12th place at 33:1 on April 29.\nOffseason.\nOn May 12, LeVert underwent surgery to repair a stress fracture in his foot. He was expected to be sidelined for 8–10 weeks, but be available for the team's August trip to play in Europe. Beilein announced on June 3 that Max Bielfeldt had undergone hip surgery and was expected to miss most of the summer. On August 6, D. J. Wilson was sidelined for 4–6 weeks following surgery on his pinky finger. This announcement came prior to the team's August 15 departure for its summer trip to Italy.\nThe team participated in a four-game exhibition tour of Italy that included stops in Rome, Verona, Vicenza, Venice and Lake Como from August 15–24. On August 28, Beilein became the 2013–14 recipient of the NCAA's Bob Frederick Sportsmanship Award, which honors \"an NCAA member institution coach or administrator who exhibits a lifelong commitment to sportsmanship and ethical conduct, leading by example and promoting positive fan involvement in and out of competition.\"\nPreseason.\nMichigan began the season ranked number 23 in the Coaches' Poll and number 24 in the AP Poll.

Athlon Sports and \"Blue Ribbon College Basketball Yearbook\" ranked Michigan 23 in their preseason rankings. Bleacher Report listed Michigan at number 20.\nCaris LeVert was a preseason All-Big Ten selection.

Prior to the season LeVert and Spike Albrecht were named co-captains.\nRoster.\nIn July, the team reclassified Max Bielfeldt from a redshirt junior to a senior, which freed up Bielfeldt's scholarship for the Class of 2015, implying Bielfeldt would play his final year of eligibility elsewhere. In November, Beilein announced that the team would redshirt Andrew Dakich so that he could play a fifth year somewhere else. However, a pair of January backcourt injuries caused Dakich's services to be needed and he played instead of redshirting. D. J. Wilson missed most of the season due to a knee injury and was redshirted.\nSchedule.\nMichigan played the 2014–15 Arizona Wildcats on the road at McKale Center as part of their home-and-away that had begun at home against the 2013–14 Wildcats. Michigan played a home-and-away with the 2014–15 and 2015–16 SMU Mustangs with the 2014 game being played on December 20, 2014, at Crisler Center, and trip in December 2015 to face the 2015–16 Mustangs in Dallas. On July 15, the non-conference schedule was announced. On August 21, the team announced the conference schedule, which included three ESPN Super Tuesday broadcasts.\nOn November 10, Michigan won an exhibition game against . The biggest storyline was that Austin Hatch scored for the team.

After raising its 2014 Big Ten Championship banner on November 15, Michigan opened its season with a 92–68 victory over Hillsdale College. The game was the first time the team had had three 20-point scorers (Derrick Walton-22, Zak Irvin-21, and Caris LeVert-20) since the 2011–12 team defeated the Oakland Golden Grizzlies on December 10, 2011, behind Trey Burke, Tim Hardaway Jr. and Evan Smotrycz. On November 17, the team opened the Progressive Legends Classic at home against Bucknell. The game was highlighted by Max Bielfeldt's career-high 18-point performance and Irvin's second consecutive 20 plus-point performance. In the second home game of the Legends Classic on November 20, Michigan faced a Detroit Titans team that was led by Juwan Howard, Jr.—the son of former Michigan star Juwan Howard. Detroit led at the half and tied the score with 5:39 remaining before Michigan went on to win 71–62 despite 24 points and 8 rebounds from Howard. In the semifinals of the Legends Classic at the Barclays Center on November 24, Michigan defeated Oregon. The next day, Michigan lost to (#12 AP Poll/#11 Coaches Poll) Villanova in the championship game. This was the first meeting between the two teams since the quarterfinals of the 1985 NCAA tournament, which Villanova also won. Villanova went on a 9–0 run to end the first half, and led by as many as 13 points early in the second half. Michigan cut the lead to 35–31 following an 11–2 run. Michigan led by as many as eight points with just under six minutes left in the game, before Villanova came back to retake the lead for good with 13 seconds remaining.

On November 29, the team defeated Nicholls State as five players scored in double figures.\nOn December 2, Michigan defeated Syracuse in an ACC-Big Ten Challenge game that went down to the wire. After blowing a 10-point second half lead Michigan needed a three point shot from Albrecht with 31 seconds remaining for the victory. On December 6, Michigan suffered its first home loss of the season to the New Jersey Institute of Technology by a 72–70 margin, despite a career-high 32 points by Levert. With the loss, Michigan's 30-game home win streak versus unranked opponents was snapped. NJIT shot 11-for-17 on its three-point shots in the game. The team lost its three subsequent games to Eastern Michigan, (#3) Arizona, and SMU. The loss to Eastern Michigan, which is separated from the University of Michigan by a 6-mile stretch of Washtenaw Avenue, ended a Big Ten-high 59-game streak without consecutive losses. Eastern Michigan was led in assists (6) by Michael Talley, son of Michigan Basketball point guard and alum Michael Talley, Jr. The December 9 80–53 loss to #3 ranked Arizona was one point shy of being the largest defeat of the Beilein era. The December 20 SMU game marked the first career start by Ricky Doyle. On December 22, the team snapped its 4-game losing streak with a victory over Coppin State who was coached by Michael Grant, the brother of former Wolverine and Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year Gary Grant. One of the game's big storylines was the first regular season point by Austin Hatch. Doyle's game-high 16 points marked the first time he led the team in scoring. Michigan won its Big Ten Conference home opener against Illinois in overtime on December 30 on the day it announced Jim Harbaugh would become the new Michigan Wolverines football head coach. Aubrey Dawkins, who had a career total of 15 points entering the game, scored a game-high 20-points.\nMichigan lost to Purdue on January 3, by making only 4 second half field goals after taking an 8-point half time lead. The team defeated Penn State on January 6 with Albrecht in the starting lineup in place of Chatman. On January 10, the team wore throwback uniforms honoring the 1988–89 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team that won the 1989 NCAA tournament. Michigan was down 49–40 with less than nine minutes remaining, before coming back to defeat Minnesota by a margin of 62–57. Michigan lost to (Receiving votes/#25) Ohio State on January 13. On January 17 Michigan defeated Northwestern, but lost LeVert for the season after he reinjured the foot that he had had surgery on the prior May. In the game, Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made his first start (in place of an ailing Albrecht) and made the game winning three-point shot. At the time of his injury, LeVert led Michigan in scoring (14.9), rebounds (4.9), assists (3.7), steals (1.7) and minutes (35.8). Nonetheless, the team defeated Rutgers in its first game without LeVert and with Dawkins making his first start. With LeVert absent, Walton scored 10 of the team's 15 points as it rallied from a 42–37 deficit to assume a 52–44 lead with just 32.5 seconds left. On January 24, Michigan fell to (AP #6/Coaches #5) Wisconsin in overtime after Walton, who had a team-high 17 points, scored Michigan's final seven points, including a game-tying three-point shot with 1.3 seconds remaining in regulation. The game had been the featured \"College GameDay\" game of the week. On January 27 with Walton and Mark Donnal sidelined Michigan defeated Nebraska, as Irvin recorded his first career double-double, leading the team with 14 points and a career-high 12 rebounds. Eventually, Walton missed final 12 of the season due to a toe injury. Due to the backcourt injuries, Dakich burned his redshirt season. Michigan finished the first half of its conference schedule with a 6–3 record.\nMichigan began February with 5 consecutive Big Ten Conference losses. On February 1, the team lost a rivalry game in overtime to Michigan State, despite career-high 18-point performances by Albrecht and Abdur-Rahkman and a career best 9-rebound performance by Max Bielfeld. On February 5 and February 8, Michigan lost to Iowa and Indiana. February 5 marked the return of Donnal to the lineup. On February 12 against Illinois, Michigan lost in overtime after surrendering a 7-point lead with a little more than 3 minutes remaining.

On February 28, Michigan ended February with a loss to (#14/#14) Maryland in the first Big Ten Conference game between the two teams and Senior night for Maryland.\nOn March 3, Michigan tied a school record with its fifth overtime game of the season (the first multiple overtime game since March 20, 2006) against Northwestern on Northwestern's Senior night. Michigan gave up last second game-tying three-point shots by Tre Demps in both regulation and the first overtime before losing in double overtime, despite career-high 28-point and 21-point performances by Irvin and Dawkins, respectively. Irvin posted his own and the team's second double-double of the season. On March 7, Michigan won its Big Ten Conference finale against Rutgers to finish the regular season at 15–15 (8–10 Big Ten).

        "text": "The 2014–15 EuroLeague Women season was the 19th edition of EuroLeague Women under its current name. Including the playoffs, the season ran from 11 November 2014 until 12 April 2015. Fifteen teams across eight countries were divided into two groups, with the top four from each group advancing to the postseason. Dynamo Kursk won Group A with a 10–2 record, while Fenerbahçe won Group B with an 11–3 record.\nIn the best-of-three quarterfinals, Dynamo Kursk beat CJM Bourges Basket, UMMC Ekaterinburg beat Nadezhda Orenburg, ZVVZ USK Praha knocked off CB Avenida, and Fenerbahçe beat Galatasaray OdeaBank. In the first semi-final, Praha upset Fenerbahçe 62–49. Ekaterinburg beat Dynamo Kurst 81–70 in the second semi-final, avenging two previous losses to Kurst on the season.\nPraha, which hosted the Final Four, got off to a quick start in the final and led 17–12 after the first quarter. Ekaterinburg fought back in the final minutes of the second quarter, narrowing the lead to 32–28 at the half. Praha started the third quarter strong and held a double-digit lead through much of the quarter, ending it with 50–40 advantage. Ekaterinburg made multiple runs in the fourth quarter, narrowing the deficit to as few as four points. However, a basket by Danielle Robinson with 2:23 left extended the lead to 11. A furious comeback effort in the final minute cut the margin to two points with 6 seconds remaining before Jana Veselá hit two foul shots to provide the final margin of 72–68. In the third-place game, Kurst defeated Fenerbahçe, 67–58.\nFormat.\nFor the 2014–15 season, fifteen teams took part in the regular season. Participants were divided into two groups – one with eight teams and one with seven teams. The regular season began on 11 November 2014 and ended on 18 February 2015.\nThe top four teams of each group during the regular season advanced to the quarterfinal playoffs, which were played in a best-of-three format from 3 March until 11 March. The winners advanced to the Final Four, which were single elimination, with games taking place on 10 April and 12 April.\nTeams.\nFifteen clubs entered the draw at Munich's Kempinski hotel on 6 July 2014. A potential 16th club could have been added with 24 hours, but was not.\nTwo countries had three clubs each (Russia and Turkey) and three countries had two teams each (Czech Republic, France, and Poland). The draw was structured such that Russia had two teams in one group and Turkey two teams in the other. The other multi-team countries had one team in each group.\nRegular season.\nWhen teams had the same record at the end of the regular season, tiebreakers were applied in the following order:\nGroup A.\nDynamo Kursk won Group A over fellow Russian team UMMC Ekaterinburg on a tiebreaker after both teams finished with a 10–2 record. USK Prague finished third with a 6–6 record. Galatasaray claimed the final playoff spot on the basis of a 2–0 record against Wisła Can-Pack after both clubs finished with a 5–7 record. Wisła's season, while disappointing overall, included a victory against Dynamo Kursk. Basket Lattes won three of their first four games, but recorded just one win the rest of the season to finish at 4–8. Lattes finished dead last in rebounding in the EuroLeague, but had the highest field-goal percentage and lowest points allowed of any team to miss the playoffs. Good Angels Košice finished last in the group with a 2–10 record. The team struggled to score, but did manage to sweep defending champion Galatasaray.\nGroup B.\nFenerbahçe won Group B with an 11–3 record. Nadezhda Orenburg finished in second place with a 10–4 record, winning the tiebreaker over Avenida on the basis of head-to-head point differential. Bourges Basket took the final playoff spot with a 9–5 record. Abdullah Gül Üniversitesi got off to a slow start, winning just one of their first five games. They finished strong, but a late loss to Nadezhda left them outside the playoffs with a final record of 7–7. Employing an aggressive style of play, the team finished first in most fouls drawn. BF Schio lost star player Chiney Ogwumike early in the year to injury, but still managed some impressive wins. The team scored 72.9 points per game, but also gave up the third most points per game in the league. In their inaugural EuroLeague season Toruń had three wins on the year, but were 1–9 in their last ten. They finished first in the league in steals, but gave up the second-most points per game. Brno did not win a single game on the season, and only kept the final margin in single digits once. They had the league's worst defense.\nFinal four.\nBids to host the 2015 Final Four were accepted until 19 February. On 9 March, it was announced that USK Prague had held selected as the host club. It was the first time the club ever hosted the event, but not the first time it was held in the Czech Republic – Brno has hosted the tournament three times (1999, 2006, and 2008).\nFinal.\nThe starting five for UMMC Ekaterinburg were Kristi Toliver, Deanna Nolan, Alba Torrens, Candace Parker, and Sandrine Gruda. USK Prague started Laia Palau, Danielle Robinson, Jana Veselá, Sonja Petrovic, and Kia Vaughn. Although the game was held in Prague, Ekaterinburg was considered the favorite.\nPraha used a series of fast breaks and efficient three-point shooting to get off to an early 17–10 lead. A layup by Silvia Dominguez made the score 17–12 at the end of the first quarter.\nIn the second quarter, Prague quickly extended its lead to nine points. After a basket by Veselá again put Prague up by nine, 27–18, with 3:27 left in the quarter, Ekaterinburg scored the next six points to get within three. The final 1:40 of the quarter saw several scores by both teams, ending with two free throws by Toliver that made the score 32–28 in favor of Prague at the halftime break. Gruda led all players with 11 points, while Parker led with 6 rebounds. Veselá led Prague with 9 points. Ekaterinburg won the rebounding battle 23–16, but failed to make a three-pointer (0/7). Prague was 4/6 on three-point attempts.\nEfficient offensive by Prague, and especially Robinson who scored 10 points in the third quarter, allowed Prague to build a double-digit lead. Prague's defense was also good in the period, not allowing a single fast-break point. At the end of the quarter, the score was Prague 50–40.\nThe \"beautiful\" fourth quarter saw a comeback effort by Ekaterinburg led by Parker and Gruda. With six minutes to go, a Parker basket and subsequent foul shot cut the lead to four. However, two quick baskets by Prague pushed the lead back to nine. A Veselá steal and layup, described by FIBA as the game's most crucial play, and a basket by Robinson with 2:23 to play gave Prague a 67–56 lead and seemingly put the game out of reach. However, a furious comeback effort by Ekaterinburg ensued. Parker made back-to-back baskets while drawing fouls. She missed the free throw on the second one, but got the rebound and a basket, resulting in 7 total points between the two possessions. Prague missed several foul shots, leaving the door partially open for Ekaterinburg. A steal and basket by Nolan with six seconds left cut the gap to two points. However, Veselá hit two foul shots to seal the victory and provide the final 72–68 margin.\nVaughn scored 18 points (12 in the second half) and grabbed 12 rebounds. She was named MVP of the Final Four thanks in part to a strong semi-final performance. Robinson scored a team-high 24, while also recording 4 rebounds and 3 assists. Parker led all players with 27 points and 14 rebounds in a losing effort. Gruda added 19 points and 9 rebounds, and Torrens scored 12. The rest of the team scored just 10 points on 4/24 shooting. As a team, Ekaterinburg was just 1/16 on three-pointers compared to 5/9 for Prague.\nThe win gave Natália Hejková her fifth Euroleague title as a coach and made her the first coach to lead three different clubs to a title. She previously coached Ružomberok to the title in 1999 and 2000 and Spartak Moscow to the title in 2007 and 2008. She has never lost a final game. Veselá claimed her third title as a player, all with different teams, becoming the sixth player to win at least three Euroleague Women titles.\nStatistical leaders.\nAlba Torrens of UMMC Ekaterinburg was named Player of the Year.\nStatistical leaders include the postseason are sorted on a per game basis.\nPoints.\nSource: FIBA Europe\nRebounds.\nSource: FIBA Europe\nAssists.\nSource: FIBA Europe"

Joel's XI cricket team in South Africa in 1924–25 was a team of English cricketers which toured South Africa between November 1924 and February 1925 and played 14 first-class cricket matches and seven other games. The tour was an unofficial one: an official tour of Australia organised by the Marylebone Cricket Club took place at the same time.\nThe tour was financed by the South African cricket authorities with assistance from the wealthy Anglo-South African financier, Solomon Joel; at the time, it was generally referred to as \"the Hon. L. H. Tennyson's XI\" after the team captain, Lionel Tennyson.\nThe team.\nMost of the players had Test cricket experience before or after the tour: only Bartley, Jameson and Nicholas did not play Test cricket. Astill, who was coaching in South Africa, was not in the touring team but played in two of the matches against South Africa.\nThe tour.\nThe 14 first-class matches (some of them scheduled for only two days) were as follows:\nThe South African captain, Vivian Neser, was the top scorer on either side, with 80 in the first innings. Buster Nupen took 5 for 54 and 5 for 33 for South Africa.\nTed Bowley scored 118 and Nupen took 5 for 65 in S. B. Joel's XI's first innings; Herbie Taylor scored 112 and Ewart Astill took 5 for 65 in South Africa's. Nupen also took 7 for 46 in the second innings; Alec Kennedy took 5 for 51 for S. B. Joel's XI. Nupen took 22 wickets for 198 in the first two matches.\nGeorge Geary took 6 for 37 and 4 for 42. Alf Hall took 6 for 62 in S. B. Joel's XI's first innings. The highest scorer on either side was Jack Russell, with 54 in S. B. Joel's XI's first innings.\nThere was no play on the final day, when South Africa were chasing a target of 211 to square the series. Nupen took 3 for 73 and 5 for 51. The highest scorer on either side was Jack Russell, with 80 in S. B. Joel's XI's first innings.\nThe highest scorer on either side was Bob Catterall, with 86 in South Africa's second innings. For South Africa, Hall took eight wickets, Nupen seven; for S. B. Joel's XI, Geary took eight wickets, Kennedy seven. The series ended 2–2.\nLeading players.\nThe series was dominated by four bowlers. For South Africa, Nupen took 37 wickets despite missing the third match, and Hall took 27. For S. B. Joel's XI, Geary took 32 wickets, and Kennedy 21. The only two centuries were scored in the second match."

The University of Cincinnati visited Bradley University on December 21, 1981, and defeated them 75–73 after 75 minutes of game time. Little-used bench player Doug Schloemer scored on a 15-foot jump shot with one second remaining to propel the Bearcats to victory.\nAt the end of regulation, which was two 20-minute halves, the score was tied at 61 apiece. Both teams played keep-away throughout each overtime period; only once, during the fifth overtime, did a team take more than a two-point lead. In the 35 additional minutes of playing time, Cincinnati only scored 14 more points while Bradley only mustered 12. The shot clock had not yet been introduced in NCAA basketball. Nine players recorded 60 or more minutes of playing time. Two players—Bradley's center Donald Reese and Cincinnati's guard Bobby Austin—each played 73 minutes, jointly setting the NCAA all-time single game minutes played record.\nThree other times has an NCAA Division I men's basketball game reached six overtime periods: Niagara defeated Siena 88–81 in 1953, Minnesota defeated Purdue 59–56 in 1955, and most recently Syracuse defeated Connecticut 127–117 in 2009."

The NCAA has officially recorded scoring statistics since it first sponsored women's basketball. Official scoring leaders are based solely on per-game average, not total points. While the NCAA maintains a ranked list of players by total points within each season on its official website, it does not include seasonal leaders in total points in its printed record books.\nUnlike for men's basketball, the NCAA does not keep records of the top scorers (by total points) for a single season. Records of the top scorer (by average points per game) for each season and scorers with more than 900 points in a season are however available.\n[[Patricia Hoskins]] holds the single-season scoring record on a per-game basis with a mark of 33.6 points per game (ppg) set in 1988–89, during her senior season at [[Mississippi Valley State Devilettes basketball|Mississippi Valley State]]. \nThe majority of per-game scoring leaders are seniors. In 1983–84, [[Delta State Lady Statesmen basketball|Delta State]]'s [[Deborah Temple]] became the first junior to lead NCAA Division I in scoring. The 1995–96 season saw [[Maine Black Bears women's basketball|Maine]]'s [[Cindy Blodgett]] become the first sophomore and first underclassmen to lead in scoring. [[Kelsey Mitchell (basketball)|Kelsey Mitchell]] (2014–15) and [[Caitlin Clark]] (2020–21) are the only freshmen to lead Division I in scoring. \nClark (2020–21, 2021–22, and 2023–24) is the only player to lead Division I women's basketball in scoring three times. Six other players have led Division I women's basketball in scoring twice. [[Andrea Congreaves]] (1991–92 and 1992–93) was the first to accomplish this feat, followed by Blodgett (1995–96 and 1996–97), [[Jackie Stiles]] (1999–2000 and 2000–01), [[Alysha Clark]] (2008–09 and 2009–10), [[Jerica Coley]] (2012–13 and 2013–14), and [[Megan Gustafson]] (2017–18 and 2018–19).\nIn regards to total points, Caitlin Clark currently holds the single-season scoring record for [[NCAA Division I]] of 1,234 points, set during her final season at [[Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball|Iowa]] in [[2023–24 Iowa Hawkeyes women's basketball team|2023–24]]. She is also the only NCAA Division I women's basketball player who scored more than 1,000 points in more than one season (2022–23 and 2023–24).\nIn the tables below, all schools are listed with their current athletic brand names, which do not always match those used by a team in the relevant season.\nReferences.\n[[Category:NCAA Division I women's basketball statistical leaders|Scoring, season]]"

Athletic Director Ed Carroll's plan was to drop as many minor sports as possible (diving, golf, &amp; men's tennis were dropped) to increase the funding for the football program. A.D. Ed Carroll tried to drop the women's tennis program in a closed secret meeting. However, the board of regents did not agree and the women's tennis program was not discontinued. Newly hired Titans Women's Tennis Coach, Brad Allen, found out about the attempted elimination of the program when he read it in the school newspaper. Coach Allen was hired in December 1985 four weeks prior to the start of the 1986 season and the team had no coach for the previous six months because the athletic department hoped the program would be discontinued.\nThe first year for Coach Allen was extremely difficult because the team budget was $5,000 and his competitors had a $50,000 budget. The first-year team budget paid for the team to buy enough tennis balls for practice, home matches, and uniforms, but no money was left for travel, equipment, or scholarships. The team lost almost all of their matches that first year. Allen had a (48–55) career record over four seasons with 20 of those losses coming in that first year. \nCoach Allen was able to save and promote the tennis program through record fundraising of about $11,000 a year and unknown to the players, he wrote scholarships from his own checkbook. Allen and the team sold fireworks, beer at UCLA football games, held tennis clinics and USTA sanctioned tournaments, and more to raise money. Now, with the increased budget through fundraising Allen was able to add more talented players. Since the 1987 season, Allen's Titans squad held the team record for most victories in a season with 15 wins and had the first winning season in the Titan's Division 1 history. During the years 1986–1989, the Titans had winning seasons three years in a row.\nThe Titans highlights were wins over Loyola Marymount, Nebraska, Cornell, Cal State Los Angeles, and conference wins over San Jose State, UNLV, UC Irvine, UOP, and Long Beach State. Another highlight came in 1989 against Harvard University when Kelli Moore and Caroline Sporer split sets against the #2 ranked doubles team in the nation. Harvard won the first set 6-4 and the Titans won the second set 7-6 and had the momentum. The Harvard team already had enough points to win the overall team match and the Harvard coach refused to play the third and final doubles set out of fear of her players losing the match and dropping their national #2 ranking. Coach Allen said, \"In my opinion, Kelli Moore and Caroline Sporer were one of the best doubles teams in the country!\"\nCoach Allen was fired in 1989 by A.D. Ed Carroll after Allen filed a grievance against the athletic department based on his annual salary of $4,800 and a team budget of $5,000 a year. Coach Allen won the grievance after it was decided his firing was obvious retribution for filing the grievance. Coach Allen laughingly said, \"Firing a coach that set school records for wins, fundraising, the number of student-athletes on the Honor Roll, and positive media coverage, including being on the front page of the Los Angeles Times Sports section would have been impossible to prove.\" Allen won his job back and could have returned as head coach at a significantly higher salary. However, Coach Allen declined the offer because he had already moved out of state, purchased a new home, and was preparing for his upcoming marriage. Coach Allen stated, \"I'll never forget my time at Fullerton and especially I loved my time on the tennis courts with the team. I will forever be proud of the outstanding team members. They gave their all on the tennis courts and the entire team was always on the Honor Roll as well. I love them all and I am grateful for the opportunity I had to work with and to know such fine young ladies.\"\nPrior to joining the Titans Women's Tennis Program and Coach Brad Allen's squad for the 1988 season player Nicole Brechtbuhl won the 1986 California Junior College State Doubles Individual title her freshmen year and in 1987 Brechtbuhl won the California Junior College State Singles Individual title in her second year.\nStandout Titan individual women's tennis performers in singles and doubles under Coach Brad Allen tenure:\nCoach Bill Reynolds years (1989–2013).\n Coaching record (24 Years/Seasons, 178 Wins–391 Losses) \nIn 1992 Titans Roseann Alva '94 with her performance came out of nowhere to get into the finals in the number No. 1 flight singles championship round of The Big West Conference Women's Collegiate Tennis Championship Tournament only to lose to her competitor from UC Santa Barbara (2–6, 2–6) in the final, coincidentally in the 1992 season the Titans women's tennis team never won a match all season. The year before in 1991 Alva '94 and Titan teammate Kelli Moore '91 made Big West First Team Doubles All-Conference as a result from the successful season performance for the doubles pair.\nThe women's team has enjoyed much success over the years as a member in the Big West Conference since the 1988.

        "title": "History of the Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The Giro d'Italia (; Tour of Italy) is an annual stage race bicycle race primarily held in Italy, while also occasionally passing through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1909 to increase sales of the newspaper \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\"; however it is currently run by RCS Sport. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1909, except when it was stopped for the two world wars. As the Giro gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened, and the peloton expanded from primarily Italian participation to riders from all over the world.\nThe first edition of the race was won by Italian Luigi Ganna who had the fewest total points at the end of the race; the same format was used for the next two years and also resulted in an Italian cyclist winning. The 1912 Giro saw the general classification contested by teams, which Atala–Dunlop won by ten points. The following year they reverted to the original system, before switching to the aggregate time model in 1914. Alfredo Binda won five editions of the race over a period of nine years, before Gino Bartali and Fausto Coppi consistently asserted their superiority in the Giro d'Italia. Italians dominated the race for forty years before the first non-Italian, Hugo Koblet, in 1950.\nAfter Koblet became the first foreigner to win the Giro, the Italians won the majority of the races held until 1968. In 1968, the Belgian Eddy Merckx won his first Giro d'Italia, which were soon followed by four more victories. Bernard Hinault won the first of his three Giros d'Italia in 1980. Ireland's Stephen Roche won the 1987 race en route to winning the Triple Crown of Cycling. Spanish rider Miguel Induráin won two consecutive Giros d'Italia, in 1992 and 1993, with his victories being followed by wins by Evgeni Berzin, Tony Rominger, and Pavel Tonkov. The next ten editions of the race were won by Italian riders, including the likes of Marco Pantani, Paolo Savoldelli, and Gilberto Simoni.\nSpain's Alberto Contador won the 2008 Giro d'Italia en route to completing the rare Giro-Vuelta double for the season. The 2009 race celebrated the hundredth year since the first edition of the Giro d'Italia and was won by the Russian Denis Menchov. The following year saw Ivan Basso win his second overall race. Contador originally won the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but after a positive drug test result was found, his victory was stripped and given to Michele Scarponi. Vincenzo Nibali, the winner of the 2013 race, led the event from the race's eighth stage and on.\n1908–1909: The idea and first race.\nThe idea of the holding a bicycle race that navigated around Italy was first suggested when \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" editor Tullo Morgagni sent a telegram to both the paper's owner, Emilio Costamagna, and cycling editor, Armando Cougnet, stating the need for an Italian tour. At the time \"La Gazzetta\"'s rival, \"Corriere della Sera\" was planning on holding a bicycle race of its own, after the success they had gained from holding an automobile race. Morgagni then decided to try and hold their race before \"Corriere della Sera\" could hold theirs, but \"La Gazzetta\" lacked the money. However, after the success \"La Gazzetta\" had with creating the Giro di Lombardia and Milan–San Remo, the owner Costamagna decided to go through with the idea. Their bike race was announced on August 7, 1908 in the first page of that day's edition of \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\". The race was to be held in May 1909. The idea of the race was inspired by the Tour de France and the success that \"L'Auto\" had gained from it.\nSince the organizers lacked the funds, 25,000 lira, needed to hold the race, they consulted Primo Bongrani, an accountant at the bank Cassa di Risparmio and friend of the three organizers. Bongrani proceeded to go around Italy asking for donations to help hold the race. Bongrani's efforts were largely successful, he had procured enough money to cover the operating costs. The money that was to be given out as prizes came from a casino in San Remo after Francesco Sghirla, a former \"Gazzetta\" employee, encouraged it to contribute to the race. Even \"Corriere\", \"La Gazzetta\"'s rival, gave 3,000 lire to the race's fund.\nOn 13 May 1909 at 02:53 am 127 riders started the first Giro d'Italia at Loreto Place in Milan. The race was split into eight stages covering . A total of 49 riders finished, with Italian Luigi Ganna winning. Ganna won three individual stages and the General Classification. Ganna received 5325 lira as a winner's prize, with the last rider in the general classification receiving 300 lira. The Giro's director received only 150 lira a month, 150 lira fewer than the last-placed rider.\n1910–1953: Italian domination.\nDuring these years, and up until 1950, the winners of the Giro d'Italia were exclusively of Italian descent. The inaugural race was such a success that the organizers added two more stages and over to the race. In addition, the organizers restructured the point distribution to determine the overall leader; the stage winner would get one point for finishing first, second place got two points, and so on until the 51st and up finishers, who would just receive 51 points. The first non-Italian stage winner, Jean-Baptiste Dortignacq, came in the 1910 edition of the race; he won the second stage of the race. Carlo Galetti led from stage two until the finish. The 1911 Giro d'Italia was the first Giro to not have the start or finish of the race in Milan. The start and finish for the race was moved to the Italian capital Rome to celebrate Italy's 50th anniversary of unification. This race also saw the first foreign rider to lead the race, the Frenchmen Lucien Petit-Breton, as well as the first repeat winner of the race in Carlo Galetti.\nThe 1912 Giro d'Italia saw some big changes to how the general classification was to be run; the race was to be centered around the team instead of the individual, meaning that the leader of the race would be a single team. Teams were allowed only four riders for each squad and were awarded points towards the general classification based on stage placings. The changes to the general classification were met with strong opposition from the start. Fourteen teams lined up at the start in Milan. Atala–Dunlop, which consisted of Luigi Ganna, Carlo Galetti, Eberardo Pavesi, and Giovanni Micheletto, led the race in all but one stage. Ganna was the only member of Atala–Dunlop that didn't finish the race, as he dropped out during the fifth stage. Galetti became the first three-time winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nThe following year's race was the last Giro to be run with a points system. The race saw the first appearance of Costante Girardengo, who won the sixth stage, and would come to dominate the Giro in the future. Carlo Oriani — who had just gotten out of serving the Italian military in the Italo-Turkish War — won the event by six points over the second-place finisher, Eberardo Pavesi. The 1914 Giro d'Italia saw the calculation of the general classification shift from a points system to a time based system. In the new system, every rider's finishing time for each stage is totaled together and the rider with the lowest total time is the overall leader. Out of the eighty-one riders entered the race only eight of them finished. The grueling race was won by Alfonso Calzolari, who won by almost two hours over the second-place finisher. A Giro was planned for 1915, but the plans were scrapped when Italy entered World War I.\nAfter the Great War ended, the race resumed in 1919. This edition of the race navigated through the ruined parts of Northern Italy, which made it hard for the organizers and riders. Costante Girardengo — the eventual winner — became the first rider to lead the Giro from start to finish. En route to winning overall, Girardengo won seven of the ten stages that composed the event. In addition, the Belgian Marcel Buysse became the first foreigner to finish on the podium; Buysse finished third overall, over an hour slower than Girardengo. The following year's Giro began with close to fifty riders and finished with ten. The first stage of the 1920 Giro d'Italia briefly went into Switzerland, which was the first time that the Giro had ever left its home country of Italy. Girardengo came into the race the favorite, but injuries sustained from crashing in the second stage forced him to withdraw. During the second stage, Gaetano Belloni capitalized on Girardengo's, race leader Giuseppe Olivieri's, Carlo Galetti's withdrawal to win the second stage and take the lead. Belloni, known by many as \"the Eternal Second, went on to win the Giro and proved he could win a race.\nCostante Girardengo won the first four stages of the 1921 Giro d'Italia and was leader after the fourth day. During the fifth stage, Girardengo was involved in a crash, and when Gaetano Belloni saw this, he attacked. Girardengo chased for before quitting. Belloni was then the new leader after stage 5's conclusion. After the fifth stage, Giovanni Brunero was the only rider close to Belloni. Brunero attacked during the race's seventh stage to win the day and take the overall lead by fifty-two seconds, which proved enough to last until the race's conclusion in Milan. The 1922 Giro d'Italia saw some controversy amongst the general classification contenders. In the race's first stage, Giovanni Brunero received an illegal wheel change – Brunero took a wheel from his teammate Alfredo Sivocci – which he was penalized 25 minutes for. Costante Girardengo and Gaetono Belloni, along with their respective teams Maino and Bianchi, wanted Brunero to be expelled from the Giro for the incident. Both the Bianchi and Maino squads eventually withdrew from the Giro due to their outrage with the organizer's decision to only give Brunero a 25-minute penalty. Brunero went on to win the Giro d'Italia, the second one of his career.\nThe 1923 Giro d'Italia was dominated by Costante Girardengo, who won eight out of the ten race's stages. Despite the large number of stage victories, Girardengo's margin of victory was thirty-seven seconds over the second-place finisher Giovanni Brunero. This was Girardengo's second career Giro victory. Girardengo, Brunero, and Gaetano Belloni didn't start the 1924 edition due to an argument over their compensation. Their decision not to participate gave the other general classification hopefuls a bigger chance to win the Giro. After the event's eighth leg that saw awful road and weather conditions, Giuseppe Enrici emerged as the overall leader and eventual winner. In addition, this Giro saw the first and only woman ever to compete in the race's history in Alfonsina Strada. She was eliminated from the race after the seventh stage; however, the organizers allowed her to continue the race thought she wouldn't be included in the general classification. Strada made it all the way to the event's finish in Milan and finished around twenty hours slower than the winner Enrici.\n1925–1935: The Binda years.\nThe 1925 Giro d'Italia saw the emergence of a new star, Alfredo Binda. Despite winning six legs of the event, Costante Girardengo did not win the race. Binda gained the lead after the fifth stage, after he and a few other general classification contenders attacked while Girardengo was repairing a flat tire. Binda won the Giro in his first attempt. Reigning champion Binda started off the following year's race with a crash in the first stage, which cost him much time. Due to the crash, Binda worked as a domestique for his teammate Giovanni Brunero. With Binda's aid, Brunero won the whole event, while Binda won six stages.\nBefore the 1927 Giro d'Italia, the organizers made some changes: the stage winner now received a one-minute time bonus and stages were now occasionally run on consecutive days, where before they had at least one rest day before each stage. The event witnessed Alfredo Binda win twelve stages and lead the race from start to finish en route to his second overall victory. Binda's record of twelve stage wins in a single Giro still stands. Binda returned the next year to win six of the twelve stages, along with the race as a whole. He first captured the lead after the fourth stage, where he significantly distanced himself from his competitors. Binda became the second person to win three Giro d'Italias in their career. In addition, the event saw a record number of participants at 298 riders, of which 126 finished the race.\nIn 1929 Alfredo Binda won a record eight consecutive stages on the way to his third consecutive, and fourth career, Giro d'Italia victory. This Giro began in Rome, which was the second time that the Giro had not started in Milan in the history of its running. When Binda came to the finish in Milan, he was booed by some of the spectators. The next year, Binda was paid 22,500 lire — the same amount of money the winner of the Giro would get — not to participate in the Giro. Binda's absence left the field open for everyone else. The eventual winner, Luigi Marchisio, gained the lead after winning the third stage of the race. Marchisio held a slim fifty-two second lead for the last six stages of the race to the finish in Milan. Marchisio became the youngest rider to win the Giro at 21 years, 1 month, and 13 days; his record stood for ten years before being broken by Fausto Coppi.\nThe famed race general classification leader's pink jersey () was introduced in 1931. The color pink was chosen for the leader's jersey because La Gazzetta dello Sport printed its news on pink paper. The maglia rosa was first worn by Learco Guerra, who won the first stage of the race. Alfredo Binda returned to the Giro after his absence the year before, but withdrew while leading during the sixth stage. The eventual winner, Francesco Camusso, attacked during the eleventh stage to claim the lead of the race. Binda came into the 1932 Giro d'Italia in poor form, so he decided to work for his teammate Antonio Pesenti. During the seventh stage of the race, Pesenti gained the lead of the race by winning the stage by means of a solo attack and went on to win the event as a whole.\nThe mountains classification and the individual time trial were both introduced in the 1933 Giro d'Italia. The mountains classification awarded points to the riders who crossed certain mountains on the race route first and the rider with the most points was the leader. In addition, the organizers also expanded the total number of stages to seventeen, it had been around twelve the few preceding years. Alfredo Binda gained the lead after the second stage, but lost it to Jef Demuysere after the fifth stage. After the eighth stage, Binda regained the lead and had a six-minute advantage over Demuysere. Binda won the next three stages and went on to win the race as a whole. Along with winning the general classification, Binda won the inaugural mountains classification. By winning this edition of the Giro, Binda became the first five-time winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nLearco Guerra won ten of the seventeen stages that comprised the 1934 Giro d'Italia. After Alfredo Binda abandoned the race because of injuries sustained from being hit by a police motorcycle, Guerra's biggest competitor was Francesco Camusso. Camusso gained the lead after his stage thirteen performance. The race's fourteenth stage was a time trial and Camusso lost over four minutes to Guerra because of his poor performance on the day. The two riders battled all the way to Milan, but Guerra won by a margin of fifty-one seconds. The 1935 edition of the Giro saw some changes to how it was run: the organizers removed the time bonuses for winning stages and began to make use of half stages — which is when two legs are held in the same day. This race was the last time Alfredo Binda competed and the first time future great Gino Bartali participated. The eventual winner, Vasco Bergamaschi, originally came to the Giro to work for his teammate, the great Costante Girardengo. However, he gained the lead for a day after the first stage and regained it again after the sixth day of racing.\n1936–1953: Bartali and Coppi battle for supremacy.\nDue to Italy's political stance at the time, the 1936 Giro d'Italia saw no foreign participation. The organizers of the race included the first uphill individual time trial in the Giro's history, which traveled up to the summit of Monte Terminillo. Gino Bartali took the lead of the race by attacking on the final climb of the hilly ninth stage and held that lead to the event's conclusion. In addition to the general classification, Bartali won his second consecutive mountains classification title. For the 1937 Giro d'Italia the organizers decided to include the Dolomites and a team time trial for the first time. The team time trial lasted and was won by Legnano, the team of the eventual winner Gino Bartali. Bartali displayed his dominance in the mountains and gained the lead after the uphill stage 8a time trial. Bartali carried the pink jersey all the way to Milan and won his second consecutive Giro d'Italia.\nGino Bartali, the winner of the past two editions, was ordered by the Italian government to race the Tour de France instead of the Giro in 1938. Giovanni Valetti took the lead of the 1938 Giro d'Italia after the mountainous ninth stage. Valetti had a lead of a minute and a half after that stage and built upon that as the Giro went on, finishing almost nine minutes ahead of the second place rider Ezio Cecchi. The 1939 Giro d'Italia was a battle between Gino Bartali and Giovanni Valetti. Valetti took the lead after the stage 9b individual time trial. Bartali became the leader after he had attacked on the Passo Rolle during the fifteenth stage. Bartali lost the lead to Valetti because he crashed and had several flat tires throughout the sixteenth stage. Valetti won his second consecutive Giro d'Italia, while Bartali left the Giro with his fourth mountains classification title.\nBartali came to the 1940 Giro d'Italia with a strong Legnano team and high ambitions to win the overall crown; however his hopes were derailed when he crashed in the race's second stage and lost time. Fausto Coppi was promoted to the new team leader after Bartali's misfortunes. Coppi donned the general classification leader's pink jersey after attacking on the Abetone in the race's eleventh stage and managed to keep the lead all the way to the event's finish in Milan. Coppi became the youngest rider to ever win the Giro at 20 years, 8 months and 25 days old, breaking the record that was held by Luigi Marchisio. World War II brought the Giro's annual running to a halt after the 1940 edition.\nBenito Mussolini, Italy's dictator at the time, tried to keep the bicycle races going while Italy was involved in the Second World War. The Giro consumed so much gasoline, food, and other supplies that it would hinder Italy's efforts towards the war, so the normal Giro was not run. The government created a new \"point series\" Giro that was composed of the major one day races that were run in Italy, where the riders would earn points based on their placing in each race. Some of the notable races that comprised this \"Giro\" were the Milan–San Remo and the Giro di Lombardia. The new \"point series\" Giro was first won by Gino Bartali in 1942. The 1943 edition of the government's Giro was interrupted after Allie forces landed in Sicily and was subsequently Mussolini deposed. With Mussolini's reign over, bicycle racing came to a complete stop in Italy.\nThe Giro resumed its annual running in 1946. The organizers added the \"maglia nera\" () for the last rider in the overall classification. Bartali and Coppi returned to the Giro now on separate teams. Coppi was put into difficulty in stage nine, where he lost a good deal of time. The twelfth stage was set to pass through Pieris on the way to Trieste; however, in Pieris there were some Yugoslavs who threw stones at some armed Italian guards. Gunfire erupted, the stage was cancelled, and close to twenty riders were escorted to Trieste. In addition, there were riots that took place in Trieste because both Yugoslavia and Italy claimed the city as part of their territory. Bartali gained the lead after the thirteenth stage of the race and went on to win the event without winning a stage.\nThe 1947 Giro d'Italia was the first Giro to have all competing riders be a part of a trade team, rather than some riders competing as independents. Fausto Coppi, Gino bartali, and Aldo Ronconi broke away during the fourth leg while climbing the Abetone and rode into Prato where Coppi won the stage and Bartali took the overall lead. Bartali held that lead until the sixteenth stage when his chain dropped on the climb of the Falzarego when Coppi saw this he attacked. On the descent of the Falzarego, the same misfortune struck Coppi, which allowed Bartali to rejoin him. Later, Coppi attacked on the Passo Pordoi and Bartali could not keep up. Coppi took the stage and the overall lead, which he held all the way to race's finish. Fiorenzo Magni won the 1948 Giro d'Italia by a margin of eleven seconds — the smallest margin of victory in the history of the race — over Ezio Cecchi. Magni gained significant time after being a part of a successful breakaway in the race's ninth day of racing. Magni's lead over race favorites Coppi and Bartali was near thirteen minutes. Cecchi briefly gained the lead of the race for two stages; however, Magni took the lead after the seventeenth stage which saw riders cross the Pordoi Pass. Coppi and his team suspected that Magni received help from the spectators, which the organizers gave Magni a two-minute penalty for. The penalty to Magni wasn't enough to prevent him from winning the race, but he did so by the slimmest of margins.\nAfter the ninth stage of the 1949 edition, Fausto Coppi was close to ten minutes behind the race leader Adolfo Leoni in the general classification. Coppi gained over nine minutes on Leoni during the tenth stage, but Leoni remained in the lead. The race's seventeenth leg went over five major climbs before finishing in Pinerolo. Coppi attacked off the start and was the first over all the climbs and the finish line in Pinerolo; his efforts gained him the race lead and a sizable lead over his rival Gino Bartali. Coppi went on to win the Giro, his third such victory. Coppi came into the 1950 Giro d'Italia as the favorite to win the general classification; however, bad luck struck as he broke his pelvis in the race's ninth day. In the eighth leg, Hugo Koblet attacked on the Pian delle Fugazze to win the stage and gain the overall lead. Koblet kept the lead all the way to the Giro's finish in Milan and in doing so he became the first foreigner to win the Giro d'Italia. In addition, Koblet won the mountains classification.\nAlmost three years after his first Giro d'Italia victory, Fiorenzo Magni won the Giro d'Italia again. Magni's major rival in the 1951 edition was the Belgian Rik Van Steenbergen who performed very well in the Dolomites. Magni took the lead after descending successfully down the final climb of the eighteenth stage and then protecting the lead all way to the race's finish. The 1952 Giro d'Italia featured one of the first deaths by a rider in the Giro in Orfeo Ponsin who died from complications after crashing into a tree on the descent of the Merluzza. Fausto Coppi took the race lead upon the tenth stage's finish, but the following day he attacked on the Passo Pordoi and rode the rest of the stage by himself to increase his lead. Coppi won two stages after gaining the overall lead, which further cemented his lead in the race.\nThe Swiss rider Hugo Koblet gained the lead of the 1953 Giro d'Italia after the race's stage eight individual time trial. Koblet defended the successfully lead from Fausto Coppi up until the twentieth stage that contained the Stelvio Pass. The night before the twentieth stage, Koblet overused amphetamines, which made him uneasy throughout the stage. Kolbet marked an attack on the ascent of the Stelvio while showing signs of weakness. Coppi heard of Koblet's drug use and attacked. Koblet was unable to match Coppi's move and Coppi went on to win the stage and take the race lead. The time gap proved to be enough and Coppi won a record tying five Giro d'Italia.\n1954–1967: Italian supremacy challenged.\nThe tensions at the start of the race in 1954 were high because the organizers paid Fausto Coppi a large sum to participate in the race The transaction angered the peloton and led to the race being not highly contested; this was extremely evident on the twenty-first stage when the riders took over nine hours to complete the stage. Eventual winner Carlo Clerici attacked during the sixth leg and gained enough of a time advantage over the rest of the peloton and win the Giro d'Italia. Fiorenzo Magni led the majority of the first half of the 1955 Giro d'Italia before losing the lead to another rider. During the twentieth leg, Magni attacked with Fausto Coppi when his fellow competitors had stopped to change their tires. Magni's efforts gave him the race lead and ultimately his third Giro d'Italia victory.\nThe 1956 edition of the Giro was without much drama until the twenty-first stage that stretched from Merano to the summit finish on Monte Bondone, a mountain in the Dolomites. The stage was bitterly cold with temperatures near that forced over sixty riders to abandon the race including the race leader Pasquale Fornara. Charly Gaul attacked during the stage and won the stage, while also gaining enough time to take the lead. After the Gaul crossed the stage's finish, he was taken to the hospital because his jersey was stuck to his skin. Gaul won the race and became the first Luxembourgian rider to win the Giro d'Italia. Gaul returned to the race in 1957 and regained the after the sixteenth leg. During the eighteenth stage, Gaul stopped to urinate which led his fierce rival Louison Bobet to initiate an attack with Gastone Nencini and Miguel Poblet. Gaul lost to Nencini; however, Gaul took out his frustration by aiding Nencini with his bid to win just to spite Bobet. With Gaul's help, Nencini went on to win the event by nineteen seconds over Bobet.\nItalian Ercole Baldini took the lead of the 1958 Giro d'Italia after winning the mountainous, fifteenth stage to Bosco Chiesanuova. He won one more stage en route to his overall victory. The 1959 Giro d'Italia was headlined by the favorites Jacques Anquetil and Charly Gaul. Anquetil held the lead of the race going into the penultimate stage. Before the stage, Gaul stated openly that he was going to attack on the slopes of the Piccolo San Bernardo which caused Anquetil to mark him for most of the stage. Gaul stayed true to his word and attacked as the riders made their way up the Piccolo San Bernardo. Anquetil — who had eaten poorly during the stage — was unable to counter his later attacks. Gaul got away, won stage, and gained close to ten minutes on Anquetil that was sufficient enough to win him the event.\nJacques Anquetil captured the lead of the 1960 Giro d'Italia after dominating the lengthy stage 14 time trial from Seregno to Lecco. Anquetil's lead shrunk because of bike issues which prevented him from countering attacks while climbing the Gavia Pass during the penultimate stage. Anquetil retained a twenty-eight second lead that proved to be enough to last to the race's finish, making him the first French winner of the Giro d'Italia. Arnaldo Pambianco captured his lone Giro victory after his efforts in a breakaway on the 1961 edition's fourteenth stage gave him the race lead.\nThe 1962 edition of the Giro d'Italia was marred by severe weather conditions. The fourteenth stage was shortened following a violent storm which prevented the climbing of the last two scheduled mountain passes and the stage finished atop the Passo Rolle. Angelino Soler won the race's sixteenth stage, with Franco Balmamion finishing second on the stage and taking the race lead. Balmamion successfully defended the lead all the way to the race's finish in Milan. Balmamion repeated as champion the next year after gaining the lead after the nineteenth stage that contained six difficult climbs.\nJacques Anquetil took the race lead at the 1964 Giro d'Italia after the stage five individual time trial. Despite the best attempts of Franco Balmamion and Italo Zilioli, Anquetil managed to keep his lead until the race's conclusion to win his second Giro d'Italia. The 1965 Giro d'Italia saw the introduction of the \"Cima Coppi\" — in honor of Fausto Coppi — which is the title given to the highest mountain in each Giro and gives more points towards the mountains classification than any other climb. Vittorio Adorni won the stage 13 individual time trial and gained a significant time advantage over the rest of the riders. Adorni held on to the race lead for the rest of the race and won his first Giro d'Italia.\nIn 1966 the points classification was introduced, which was to be awarded the most consistent high finishing riders in the peloton, specifically the sprinters. Jacques Anquetil came to the race with aspirations to win, but after losing time early on, he decided to ride for his teammate Gianni Motta. With Anquetil's help, Motta rode well through the mountains, gained the lead after the fifteenth leg, and went on to win the event as a whole. In addition, Motta also won the inaugural points classification. During the 1967 edition's twentieth stage, Felice Gimondi attacked on the slopes of the Tonale and race leader Anquetil was not able to match his move. Upon the stage's conclusion, Gimondi had gained the race lead by over three minutes. Gimondi raced into Milan the next day and won his first Giro d'Italia victory.\n1968–1996: Foreign domination.\nThe 1968 Giro d'Italia saw two important firsts: the first tests for drug use and the first prologue. A total of eight riders tested positive during the Giro. Belgian Eddy Merckx won his first Giro d'Italia after winning the twelfth stage's finish atop the Tre Cime di Lavaredo and also regaining the race lead. En route to the overall victory, Merckx won four stages. Merckx returned in 1969 and was leading the race after the sixteenth stage that ended in Savona. Merckx tested positive for a banned substance after the stage and was subsequently disqualified from the race; to this day Merckx still proclaims his innocence. Felice Gimondi took the lead after Merckx's dismissal and held it all the way to the race's conclusion.\nMerckx came back the following year to liking of his sponsor. Merckx took the lead after stage five and never relinquished it; he dominated the lengthy stage nine time trial. Merckx went on to win the Tour de France and in doing so became the third rider to win two Grand Tours in a single calendar year. In 1971, reigning champion Merckx decided to ride the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré instead. Felice Gimondi lost substantial time early on in the race to put him out of contention, while fellow Italian and teammate Gianni Motta tested positive for banned substances and was dismissed from the Giro. Swedish cyclist Gösta Pettersson gained the lead after the race's eighteenth stage and held it all the way to the finish. Pettersson became the first Swedish cyclist to win a Grand Tour.\nMerckx returned to the Giro in 1972 and resumed his domination. He grabbed the lead after a long solo attack during the race's seventh stage and never let go of the lead. Merckx led the 1973 Giro d'Italia from start to finish; a feat that had not been done since Alfredo Binda did in 1927. José Manuel Fuente gained the lead early on in 1974 and held it all the way up to the Giro's fourteenth stage. Fuente had forgotten to eat properly during the fourteenth stage and suffered because of it; he lost over ten minutes to Merckx. Merckx would go on to win his fifth and final Giro d'Italia by just 12 seconds, joining the likes of Alfredo Binda and Fausto Coppi as the only five-time winners of the Giro d'Italia. Merckx success continued on into the season as he won the Tour de France and the men's road race at the World Championships and became the first rider to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling – which consists of winning two Grand Tours and the men's road race at the World Championships in one calendar year.\nWith the absence of Merckx from the 1975 edition due to illness, the competition increased between the other riders. Fausto Bertoglio and Francisco Galdós battled during the latter half of the race. The final stage of the race had a summit finish on the Stelvio Pass where Bertoglio fended off the attacks of Galdós to seal his overall victory. Johan de Muynck was in the lead of the 1976 Giro d'Italia when he crashed during the twentieth stage. Muynck's injuries prevented him from performing well in the next day's individual time trial. Felice Gimondi capitalized on Muynck's woes and took the lead on the final day of racing and went on to win his second Giro d'Italia. This was the last Giro that Merckx raced; he finished eighth overall.\nFreddy Maertens and Francesco Moser dominated the early portion of the 1977 Giro d'Italia. Belgian Michel Pollentier took the lead from Moser when the race hit the high mountains near the end of the race. Pollentier went on to win the penultimate stage en route to his lone Grand Tour victory of his career. Johan de Muynck first grabbed the lead of the 1978 Giro d'Italia after escaping during the third stage and soloing to victory. He then successfully defended his slim lead throughout the rest of the race and won the Giro. The 1979 edition featured less climbing than normal and a total of five time trials. Francesco Moser grabbed the early lead of the race after winning the first two time trials of the race. Giuseppe Saronni took the lead after the third time trial which ended in San Marino. Saronni then rode into Milan with over a two-minute lead over Moser to win the Giro.\nBernard Hinault's Giro d'Italia was in 1980. Up until the twentieth stage, the race was being dominated by the Italian competitors. During the twentieth stage, Hinault and teammate Jean-René Bernaudeau distanced themselves from the general classification contenders on the slopes of the Stelvio Pass and rode into Sondrio for the stage win. Bernaudeau won the stage, but Hinault took a sizable lead over the rest of the field – which he then held to the race's conclusion in Milan. The 1981 Giro d'Italia was hotly contested, with four riders being 30 seconds apart after twenty days of racing. Stage 20 saw the finish atop the Tre Cime di Lavaredo. Giovanni Battaglin took the lead by almost a minute over the second place rider after doing well on the climb of the Lavaredo. Battaglin won the Giro after putting in a solid performance in the race's final stage, an individual time trial.\nBernard Hinault returned to the Giro in 1982. Hinault dominated the race with stage wins in every time trial stage and stage wins atop the Campitello Matese and the Montecampione en route to the overall victory. Hinault would go on to win the Tour de France that year as well and complete the coveted Giro-Tour double. The 1983 Giro d'Italia featured few hard stages in the mountains and four time trials. The winner of the race, Giuseppe Saronni, gained the lead after the race's seventh stage that finished in Salerno. From there, Saronni won two more stages and successfully guarded his lead all the way to Milan to win his second Giro d'Italia.\nThe 1984 Giro d'Italia was a battle between Italian Francesco Moser and Frenchman Laurent Fignon. Moser was leading the race up until the mountainous stage twentieth stage that finished in Arabba. Fignon took the lead after riding into Arabba over two minutes ahead of Moser. Moser dashed through the course setting a blistering pace on the roads, he won the stage and the Giro due to his performance in the final stage. Bernard Hinault raced the Giro again in 1985. The race was led early on by Italian Roberto Visentini. However, after the stage twelve time trial, Hinault was in control of the race and went to win his third Giro d'Italia.\nGiuseppe Saronni led the 1986 Giro d'Italia for the majority of the race before losing it to Roberto Visentini in the Alps. Visentini then fought off attacks from the challengers in the Dolomites en route to his first Giro d'Italia general classification victory. The 1987 edition was highlighted by the controversy between 's two general classification riders Roberto Visentini and Stephen Roche. Roche led the race early on but lost the lead to Visentini after crashing during the thirteenth stage. Roche attacked on the race's mountainous fifteenth stage despite orders from Carrera team management not to. Roche took the lead and wound up winning the Giro. Roche's success would not stop there during the 1987 season, he would go on to win the Tour de France and the men's road race at the World Championships to complete the Triple Crown of Cycling.\nThe 1988 Giro d'Italia is remembered for the fourteenth stage that contained very poor weather throughout the stage and most notably on the slopes of the Passo di Gavia. Franco Chioccioli led the race at the start of the fabled fourteenth stage. On the slopes of the Gavia, Andrew Hampsten and Erik Breukink rode away from their fellow riders; Breukink would go on to win the stage, but Hampsten would take the overall lead. Hampsten went on to win the race and became the first non-European to win the Giro d'Italia.\nDutchman Erik Breukink gained the lead of the 1989 Giro d'Italia after winning the stage 10 individual time trial. Breukink lost the lead after the fourteenth stage that contained five major passes. The Frenchman Laurent Fignon took the lead of the race from Breukink and then held it all the way to the finish in Florence. This was also the year the intergiro classification was introduced to the Giro d'Italia – the calculation for the intergiro is similar to that of the general classification, in each stage there is a midway point that the riders pass through a point and where their time is stopped and then totaled up after each stage. Jure Pavlič was the first winner of the intergiro classification. Gianni Bugno dominated the 1990 edition after gaining the lead after the first stage. Bugno led the race from start to finish – a feat that had only been done three times before in the history of the Giro d'Italia.\nFranco Chioccioli reigned supreme at the 1991 Giro d'Italia. Chioccioli led the race for all but two stages. He cemented his lead and the eventual overall victory by winning the seventeenth stage that contained a summit finish on the Passo Pordoi and winning the penultimate stage which was an individual time trial. Miguel Induráin became the first Spanish rider to win the Giro d'Italia in 1992 Indurain first gained the lead of the race after the hilly third stage that led into Arrezo and then held it all the way to the finish in Milan. He separated himself from his competitors during the race's two individual time trials, both of which he won. Indurain would go on to ride the Tour de France in July and win it, and in doing so completed the rare Giro-Tour double.\nIndurain returned in 1993 to defend his crown. The only rider that could compete with Indurain was the Latvian Piotr Ugrumov, who attacked Indurain repeatedly throughout the race. Indurain won two stages – both time trials – en route to his second Giro d'Italia victory. He would go on to complete the Giro-Tour double for the second consecutive year, a feat which had never been accomplished before. The 1994 Giro d'Italia saw Russian Evgeni Berzin gain the overall lead after winning the fourth stage, featuring a summit finish on Campitello Matese. Berzin consolidated his lead with victories in the race's final two time trials en route to the overall victory. In doing so he spoiled Indurain's hopes for a three peat.\nTony Rominger came to the 1995 Giro d'Italia in great form. Rominger gained the lead after the stage two time trial and never gave it up. His opposition came from the returning champion Berzin and teammate Piotr Ugrumov who attacked each other repeatedly, which greatly hurt their chances. In addition to the general classification, Rominger also won the points and intergiro classifications. The 1996 Giro d'Italia celebrated the centenary of the founding of \"La Gazzetta dello Sport\" by holding the first three stages in the Greek capital of Athens. Eventual winner Pavel Tonkov first gained the race lead after the mountainous thirteenth stage that ended in Prato Nevoso. Tonkov lost his slim lead to the Spaniard Abraham Olano for a two-stage period, before regaining it after stage 21, which contained five climbs of high severity. Tonkov rode into Milan the next day winner of the Giro d'Italia.\n1997–2007: Italians resume conquest.\nPavel Tonkov returned to the Giro in 1997 with ambitions of repeating as winner. Tonkov first led the race after winning the stage three time trial and up until the fourteenth stage's conclusion. During the fourteenth stage, Italian Ivan Gotti attacked and soloed his way to take the stage win in Breuil-Cervinia and the race lead. Gotti extended his lead after performing well in the mountainous nineteenth stage and went on to win the Giro three days later. Swiss rider Alex Zülle was the first rider to lead the 1998 Giro d'Italia and he led for the most part of the race. Zülle was leading the race as it entered the Dolomites. Italians Giuseppe Guerini and Marco Pantani were at the head of the race during the race's mountainous seventeenth stage; the two riders worked together to get to the stage finish in Selva di Val Gardena. Guerini won the stage while Pantani took the overall lead. Pantani went on to win the Giro and subsequently the 1998 Tour de France, thus completing the rare feat of winning the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France in the same calendar year.\nPantani returned to the Giro in 1999 while in peak physical form. Pantani gained the lead after the race's fourteenth stage and as the race hit the high mountains, he extended his lead with three stage wins. On the morning of the twentieth stage, Pantani was dismissed from the Giro after having hematocrit levels above 50%. 1997 victor Ivan Gotti, who was second place at the time, subsequently took the lead and wound up winning the Giro for the second time in his career. Francesco Casagrande took the lead in the 2000 Giro d'Italia after a long solo attack during the race's ninth stage. Fatigue set in with Casagrande as the race wore on and on the penultimate stage he lost the lead, and ultimately the Giro, to Stefano Garzelli.\nDario Frigo took the lead in the 2001 Giro d'Italia after the race's fourth stage. Frigo defended the lead until the thirteenth stage, when the race went over some major passes in the Dolomites. During the thirteenth stage, Gilberto Simoni attacked and his labor bore fruits as he took the race leader's \"maglia rosa\" when the stage was over. Frigo gained some time back in the stage fifteen time trial, but it wasn't enough to overcome Simoni's lead. Simoni went on to win the Giro d'Italia by a wide margin after Frigo's withdrawal. Stefano Garzelli took the early lead after winning the 2002 Giro d'Italia's second stage, but soon tested positive for probenecid – a banned substance – and was forced to leave the Giro. In the final major mountain stage of the race, stage seventeen, Paolo Savoldelli attacked with around nine kilometers to go in the stage and managed to take the lead and go on to win the Giro.\nAlessandro Petacchi was the first rider to lead the 2003 Giro d'Italia after winning the opening stage. Petacchi lost the lead to Stefano Garzelli after he won the stage seven summit finish on the Monte Terminillo. Garzelli then lost the lead to Gilberto Simoni after the tenth stage. Simoni went on to win the Giro after expanding his lead through stage wins on the Monte Zoncolan and the Alpe di Pampeago The 2004 Giro d'Italia saw a battle between Damiano Cunego, Serhiy Honchar, and Gilberto Simoni. Simoni gained the lead after the third stage and held it to the seventh stage where he lost it to Cunego. Cunego held the lead until the lengthy stage twelve individual time trial when Yaroslav Popovych took the lead. Cunego regained the lead after the sixteenth stage and went on to win the race, while fellow Italian Alessandro Petacchi won nine out of the 21 stages.\nThe 2005 Giro d'Italia saw the race lead change hands multiple times within the first week of racing. Ivan Basso gained the lead after the eleventh stage, which finished in Zoldo Alto. Two days later, Paolo Savoldelli gained the lead after the thirteenth stage that finish in Urtijëi. Savoldelli went on to win his second Giro d'Italia while fending off the attacks of Gilberto Simoni and José Rujano. Ivan Basso won the 2006 Giro d'Italia in a convincing fashion. Basso gained the lead after winning the race's eighth stage that featured a summit finish on the Passo Lanciano. He won two more stages after taking the lead of the race en route to his overall victory.\nThe race leader's pink jersey changed hands five times in the first week of racing in the 2007 Giro d'Italia. Andrea Noè took the lead away from Marco Pinotti after the race's tenth stage. Noè lost the lead to Danilo Di Luca after he won the twelfth stage into Briançon. Di Luca was not seriously challenged after taking the race lead in stage 12, and comfortably won the Giro in Milan with a two-minute gap over Schleck in second.\n2008–2019: International Firsts.\nThe 2008 Giro d'Italia was led for many days by Giovanni Visconti who had gained the lead after participating in a breakaway. Eventual winner Alberto Contador first took the lead of the race after the second mountain stage, to Marmolada, by finishing nearly fifteen minutes ahead of previous race leader Gabriele Bosisio – who had just gained the lead the stage before. In the race's final week, Contador faced stern challenges from Riccò and defending Giro champion Danilo Di Luca; however, their efforts bore no fruits as Contador went on to win the race. Russian Denis Menchov won the 2009 centennial edition of the Giro, after having taken the lead in a long time trial in stage 12, and defended it vigorously against attacks from his closest challenger, Danilo Di Luca, during the mountain stages of the final week. Di Luca came in second, 41 seconds behind the winner, and won the points classification. Subsequent to the Giro, both he and third-place finisher Franco Pellizotti became embroiled in doping scandals, were given bans, and had their results stripped.\nThe 2010 Giro d'Italia saw the lead change hands eight times during the race. Spanish rider David Arroyo was leading the race as it headed into the final mountain stages of the race. Arroyo lost the race lead to Ivan Basso after the nineteenth stage where he lost over three minutes to Basso. Basso fended off attacks and performed adequately in the final time trial to secure his second Giro d'Italia victory. Alberto Contador returned to the Giro in 2011 and was seen as the favorite for the overall victory on what many saw as a very difficult course.\nOn stage 3 of the 2011 Giro d' Italia, Wouter Weylandt had a fatal crash. The next stage was neutralized, with his Leopard Trek team and friend Tyler Farrar allowed to pass the finish line first.\nContador assumed the race lead after winning the ninth stage to Mount Etna. Contador continued to increase his advantage by riding well in the remaining stages and winning the stage 16 individual time trial, which allowed him to win his second Giro d'Italia championship. Contador raced the 2011 Giro despite having an ongoing trial about his possible use of clenbuterol, a banned substance. On 6 February 2012 the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided that Contador should lose his 2010 Tour de France title and his results since that race, which included his Giro victory in May 2011, and receive a two-year ban. After Contador's conviction, runner up Michele Scarponi was then delegated the overall victory.\nThe 2012 Giro d'Italia saw a battle between Canadian Ryder Hesjedal and Spaniard Joaquim Rodríguez. Hesjedal first took the lead after finishing well on the seventh stage that featured a summit finish to Rocca di Cambio. Rodríguez snagged a narrow lead over Hesjedal after winning the tenth stage into Assisi. Hesjedal regained the lead after the mountainous fourteenth stage; however, Rodríguez took it back the next day. Rodríguez held that lead all the way to the final stage, which he came into with a 31-second buffer over Hesjedal. Hesjedal rode and manage to finish with a time 47 seconds better than Rodríguez, giving him the overall victory in the Giro. This made him the first rider from Canada to win a grand tour and the second North American, after Andy Hampsten in 1988, to win the Giro. In 2013 Vincenzo Nibali took the lead after the race's eighth stage. Nibali would go on to win the race after he expanded his lead through performing well in the early mountain stages and winning both the stage 18 individual time trial and the penultimate stage of the race. 2014 saw the first ever Colombian grand tour winner, and Giro d'Italia winner from South America in Nairo Quintana.\nTom Dumoulin won the 100th Giro in 2017, the first time ever that a Dutch cyclist won the Giro. He was also the first Dutchman to win the overall in a Grand Tour since Joop Zoetemelk won the 1980 Tour de France. A year later, Chris Froome won the 2018 Giro, becoming the first British rider to win the overall race. The 2019 Giro d'Italia champion was Richard Carapaz, who became the first Ecuadorian to win the Giro.\n2020–2022: Recent years.\nThe 2020 Giro d'Italia was due to start in Hungary for the first three stages, the first Grand Tour stages to take place in that country, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, 2020 marked the first time in the race's history that it was held in October instead of May or June. This edition ended up as a slugfest, because in the last four days of the race four different riders wore the Maglia Rosa in João Almeida, Wilco Kelderman and Jai Hindley before Tao Geoghegan Hart won the race on the final time trial. The 2021 edition was won by Egan Bernal who dominated the race for the most part with only underdog and career long Domestique Damiano Caruso finishing inside +2:00 of him. The 2022 Giro d'Italia saw a battle between Richard Carapaz and Jai Hindley in which Hindley took over the lead on the final mountain stage and defended it in the final time trial becoming the second Australian to win a grand tour and the first to win the Giro."

        "text": "The 2016 Super Rugby season was the 21st season of Super Rugby and the first season featuring an expanded 18-team format. It was also the first season that teams outside Australia, New Zealand and South Africa featured, with the Jaguares from Argentina and the Sunwolves from Japan taking part. This season also saw the return of the Kings, who competed just once before, in the 2013 Super Rugby season.\nThe round-robin games took place every weekend from 26 February to 16 July 2016 (with a break for international matches during June), followed by the finals series at the end of July and culminating in the final on 6 August.\nThe Hurricanes won their first championship after repeating their efforts of 2015 by finishing first in the regular season and hosting the final at Westpac Stadium, but this time they won, beating the Lions 20–3. Unlike 2015, where the Hurricanes looked likely to finish the regular season first with a number of rounds to go, they were sitting in seventh going into the final week of the regular season and while guaranteed a play-off spot, they required a number of upset results to elevate them to first. In particular the Lions losing to the Jaguares and scoring no match points after sending an under-strength side to Argentina, thereby losing their chance to host the final.\nCompetition format.\nThe 18 teams were grouped geographically in two regional groups, each consisting of two conferences: the Australasian Group, with five teams in the Australian Conference and five teams in the New Zealand Conference and the South African Group, with six South African teams, one Argentinean team and one Japanese team split into a four-team Africa 1 Conference and a four-team Africa 2 Conference.\nIn the group stages, there were 17 rounds of matches, where each team played 15 matches and had two rounds of byes for a total of 135 matches.\nTeams played six intra-conference matches; in the four-team African Conferences, each team played the other three teams in their conference at home and away, while in the five-team Australasian Conferences, each team played two teams home and away and once against the other two teams (one at home and one away). The other nine matches were a single round of matches against each team in the other conference in their group, as well as against each team from one of the conferences in the other group. For 2016, the teams in Africa 1 played the teams in the Australian Conference, while the teams in Africa 2 played the teams in the New Zealand Conference.\nThe top team in each of the four conferences automatically qualified to the Quarter Finals. The next top three teams in the Australasian Group and the next top team in the South African group also qualified to the Quarter Finals as wildcards. The conference winners were seeded #1 to #4 for the Quarter Finals, in order of log points gained during the group stages, while the wildcards were seeded as #5 to #8 in order of log points gained during the group stages.\nIn the Quarter Finals, the conference winners hosted the first round of the finals, with the highest-seeded conference winner hosting the fourth-seeded wildcard entry, the second-seeded conference winner hosting the third-seeded wildcard entry, the third-seeded conference winner hosting the second-seeded wildcard entry and the fourth-seeded conference winner hosting the top-seed wildcard entry.\nThe Quarter Final winners progressed to the Semi-Finals, where the highest seed to reach the Semi-Finals hosted the lowest seed and the second-seeded semi-finalist hosted the third-seeded team.\nThe winners of the Semi-Finals progressed to the Final, at the venue of the highest-seeded team.\nMatches.\nThe fixtures for the 2016 Super Rugby competition were released on 28 September 2015: The following matches were played during the regular season:\nFinals.\nThe four conference winners advanced to the Quarter Finals, where they had home advantage against four wildcard teams, which consisted of the third to fifth-ranked teams in the Australasian Group and the third-ranked team in the South African Group.\nThe final seedings of these teams were:\nThe play-off fixtures were as follows:\nPlayers.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named for the 2016 Super Rugby season:\nPlayer statistics.\nThe top ten points scorers during the 2016 Super Rugby season are:\nReferees.\nThe following refereeing panel was appointed by SANZAAR for the 2016 Super Rugby season:"

Since 2009, Jones has had consistent yearly stints in the New Zealand NBL, largely due to gaining New Zealand citizenship in 2012. He also played consistently in the Persian Gulf region between 2017 and 2022.\nHigh school career.\nJones attended Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California, where he was a four-year letterman for head coach Gary McKnight. As a sophomore in 2001–02, he averaged 8.4 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. As a junior in 2002–03, he averaged 10.8 points and 5.3 rebounds per game, helping Mater Dei to the CIF title with a 35–2 record. As a senior in 2003–04, he averaged 20.0 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.4 assists per game, helping Mater Dei to a 24–5 record and the Sierra League title. He finished his high school career as a three-time All-CIF and All-Sierra League honoree.\nCollege career.\nAs a freshman at Oregon State in 2004–05, Jones played in 21 games with five starts and averaged 3.9 points and 1.9 rebounds in 9.8 minutes per game. He posted season highs of 14 points and 32 minutes, as well as eight rebounds, against Georgia.\nAs a sophomore in 2005–06, Jones was one of only two players to appear in all 31 games (starting 21), averaging 9.2 points in 28.3 minutes.\nAs a junior in 2006–07, Jones led the team in scoring (15.3 points, eighth in the Pac-10) and steals (1.5, fourth in the Pac-10), and finished second in rebounding (5.7, 15th in the Pac-10). He was one of two players to start all 32 games and registered 1,000 minutes exactly (31.3 per game). His 49 steals were the most by a Beaver since 1999–00, and he had a stretch of 20 straight games with a steal. He scored a career-high 35 points against Northern Colorado, becoming the first Beaver to score at least 30 points in a game since January 2000. Following the season, Jones put his name on the early-entry list for the 2007 NBA draft, but decided to return for his senior season.\nJones was the only senior player on the 2007–08 Beavers roster. During the season, he became just the 34th Beaver to score 1,000 career points, finishing his career with 1,166. In 30 games, he averaged 10.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.1 assists per game.\nProfessional career.\n2008–09 season.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2008 NBA draft, Jones played for the Chicago Bulls in the Orlando Summer League, where he averaged 4.6 points and 3.6 rebounds in five games. On November 7, he was selected by the Iowa Energy in the fourth round of the 2008 NBA Development League Draft. On December 24, he was waived by the Energy after appearing in just two games. He went on to play for the Manawatu Jets during the 2009 New Zealand NBL season, earning Player of the Week honors for Round 8 and averaging 27.3 points (second in the league), 9.8 rebounds, 1.6 assists and 1.6 steals in 16 games.\n2009–10 season.\nAfter initially signing in Germany, Jones joined Finnish club Kauhajoen Karhu. He appeared in seven games for Karhu in October before having a one-game stint with Espoon Honka on November 7. He then had a five-game stint with Hungarian club Falco KC Szombathely between November 21 and December 19.\nOn March 4, 2010, Jones signed with the Everton Tigers for the rest of the 2009–10 British Basketball League season. The Tigers went on to win the BBL play-offs. In 14 games, he averaged 5.8 points and 2.4 rebounds per game.\nOn May 28, 2010, Jones signed with the Wellington Saints as injury cover for Eric Devendorf. In five games during the 2010 New Zealand NBL season, he averaged 7.2 points and 2.6 rebounds in 12.8 minutes per game.\n2010–11 season.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, Jones played in Syria for Al-Wahda. He lived in the Syrian capital of Damascus and said he was fortunate to play there before civil war broke out. Jones regularly played in front of 4,000 fans, including military personnel, at home games. In eight games for the club between November 26 and January 3, he averaged 12.8 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game.\n2011–12 season.\nOn August 26, 2011, Jones signed with HKK Zrinjski Mostar of Bosnia for the 2011–12 season. In 24 Bosnian League games, he averaged 14.0 points, 8.0 rebounds, 1.3 assists and 2.2 steals per game. He also averaged 15.2 points, 13.0 rebounds, 1.0 assists and 2.2 steals in nine Balkan League games.\nOn April 20, 2012, Jones played for the Manawatu Jets as an injury replacement for Dustin Mitchell. He was thrown into a starting role for the Jets and he provided them with the spark they needed to beat the Otago Nuggets 103–79, recording 22 points, 12 rebounds and seven assists. While it was his first game for the Jets, he had arrived in New Zealand in March, a mere three days after playing in his final game for Zrinjski. However, he was unable to play for the Jets because they already had their quota of two imports playing in Mitchell and Josh Pace. He appeared in five games for the Jets between April 20 and May 4 before Chris Hagan permanently replaced Mitchell on May 5. Jones was relegated to the sidelines due to his citizenship application still being processed. On May 20, with import duo Hagan and Pace being rested, Jones was able to play in the Jets' regular-season finale, scoring a game-high 25 points in a 78–69 loss to the Hawke's Bay Hawks. In six games for the Jets, he averaged 22.3 points, 9.8 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 1.7 steals per game.\n2012–13 season.\nIn July 2012, Jones signed with BCM U Piteşti of Romania for the 2012–13 season.

Despite having gained New Zealand citizenship, he had to play as an import for the Jets due to a league rule which allows only one naturalized New Zealand player per team; team captain Nick Horvath already filled that spot. In his season debut on May 4, Jones scored 13 points in 32½ minutes in a 107–77 loss to the Wellington Saints. In 13 games for the Jets in 2013, he averaged 20.2 points, 7.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists and 1.1 steals per game.\n2013–14 season.\nOn August 27, 2013, Jones signed with Pallacanestro Cantù of Italy for the 2013–14 season.

He also played in 16 Eurocup games, averaging 6.3 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.\nOn May 1, 2014, Jones signed with the Canterbury Rams for the rest of the 2014 New Zealand NBL season.

On October 28, he parted ways with Biella after appearing in four games. He subsequently joined Bashkimi Prizren of the Kosovo Basketball Superleague in November. In seven league games for Bashkimi, he averaged 22.9 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 2.3 steals per game. He also played in seven Balkan League games, averaging 21.6 points, 8.0 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.6 steals per game.\nOn February 27, 2016, Jones signed with the Canterbury Rams for the 2016 New Zealand NBL season, returning to the club for a second stint. In the team's season opener on March 11, Jones recorded team highs of 22 points and 11 rebounds in a 100–86 win over the Nelson Giants.

He returned to action for the team's next game on March 25, recording 13 points, six rebounds and three assists in a 98–94 win over the Southland Sharks.

He subsequently earned Player of the Week honors for Round 9. On May 19, he recorded 22 points and a season-high 15 rebounds in a 71–65 win over the Mountainairs. Jones helped the Rams claim the minor premiership with a first-place finish and a 13–5 record. In their semi-final match-up, the Rams were outclassed by the fourth-seeded Super City Rangers, losing 104–85 despite a 17-point effort from Jones. In 17 games for the Rams in 2016, he averaged 23.1 points, 9.5 rebounds, 1.8 assists, 1.4 steals and 1.1 blocks per game. He subsequently won the NBL's Kiwi MVP, Most Outstanding Forward and Most Outstanding Kiwi Forward/Centre, and earned NBL All-Star Five honors.\n2016–17 season.\nOn October 23, 2016, Jones signed with Sigal Prishtina of the Kosovo Superleague, returning to the league for a second stint.

In 10 games for Helios, he averaged 15.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 1.4 assists and 1.0 steals per game.\nIn March 2017, Jones re-joined the Canterbury Rams ahead of the 2017 New Zealand NBL season. In the Rams' season opener on March 18, Jones had 22 points and eight rebounds in a 114–107 loss to the Super City Rangers. The following day, he recorded game highs of 33 points, 10 rebounds and four steals in a 99–87 overtime win over the Hawke's Bay Hawks. On April 25, he recorded a season-high 41 points and 12 rebounds in a 106–89 win over Hawke's Bay. In late May, coach Mark Dickel changed the makeup of his starting five by relegating Jones to a bench role. Dickel's decision was defensive-minded as he looked to morph the team into a more balanced outfit ahead of the playoffs. The Rams finished the regular season in fourth place with a 10–8 record, and lost to the first-seeded Wellington Saints 94–73 in their semi-final match-up. Jones scored 10 points in the loss.

        "text": "The 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball championship game was the finals of the 2007 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament and determined the national champion for the 2006–07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta, Georgia between the South Regional Champion and the overall No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and the Midwest Regional Champion and defending national champion, the No. 1-seed Florida Gators. Florida won 84-75, to successfully defend their national championship, becoming the seventh school to repeat as national champions, and were the last to accomplish such a feat until Connecticut in 2024.\nFor the second time in three years, the national title game was played between two No. 1 seeds. This game was a rematch of the game at O'Connell Center on December 23, 2006, which was won by Florida who defeated Ohio State in an 86–60 victory. This game featured the same two teams that participated in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game marking the first time (and only current in Tournament history) that the same two schools were competing for the football and basketball national championships which saw Florida beat Ohio State 41–14 to be the national champions of college football.\nParticipants.\nOhio State Buckeyes.\nOhio State entered the South region of the tournament as the overall No. 1 seed. In the first round, Greg Oden had a double-double to beat Central Connecticut State 78–57. In the second round, Ohio State overcame a late deficit for a 78–71 overtime win over Xavier. In the Sweet 16, Oden blocked a last second shot by Ramar Smith to beat Tennessee 85–84. In the Elite Eight, Ohio State used Oden's 17 points to beat Memphis 92–76 for a trip to the Final Four. In the Final Four, Oden's 13 points were six points short of Roy Hibbert's 19 points but it was Ohio State who got the victory beating Georgetown 67–60 for a trip to the National Championship Game for the first time since 1962.\nFlorida Gators.\nDefending champion Florida entered the tournament as the No. 1 seed in the Midwest Region. In the first round, Florida played a dominant second half against Jackson State outscoring them 71–34 in the 2nd half to take a 112–69 win. In the second round, Florida beat Purdue 74–67 to stay alive in their quest for a 2nd straight national title. In the Sweet 16, Florida took another step closer to becoming the first team to win back-to-back championships since the 1991–92 Duke Blue Devils with a 65–57 win over Butler. In the Elite Eight, Florida beat Oregon 85–77 to advance to the Final Four. In the national semi-final, Florida beat UCLA 76–66 to advance to the championship game.\nGame summary.\nIn a rematch of a regular season meeting which had been won 86–60 by Florida in Gainesville, the Gators survived 25 points and 12 rebounds from Buckeyes center Greg Oden with stellar play from guards Lee Humphrey and Taurean Green with inside contributions coming from Al Horford (18 points) and tourney Most Outstanding Player Corey Brewer. Billy Donovan became the third-youngest coach (at age 41) to win two titles. Only Bob Knight (at Indiana) and San Francisco's Phil Woolpert both won two titles at the age of 40.\nThe Gators are the first team ever to hold the NCAA Division I college football and basketball titles in the same academic year (2006–07) and calendar year (2006 and 2007). Coincidentally, Florida also beat Ohio State (by a score of 41–14) in the College Football Championship, the first time in college sports history that identical match-ups and results have occurred in both football and basketball championships. This was also the first time in NCAA D-I men's basketball history that exactly the same starting five were able to win back-to-back titles (Joakim Noah, Corey Brewer, Lee Humphrey, Al Horford, Taurean Green). Florida's Lee Humphrey also set the all-time NCAA Tournament record for three-point field goals made with 47. Humphrey surpassed Bobby Hurley's record of 42."

        "text": "The 2014 Belmont Stakes was the 146th running of the Belmont Stakes. It was run on June 7, 2014, and was televised on NBC. California Chrome had a chance to complete the third leg of the Triple Crown after his victories in the 2014 Kentucky Derby and the 2014 Preakness Stakes. However, it was Tonalist who won the race. Commissioner placed second and Medal Count took third. California Chrome finished in a tie for fourth with Wicked Strong.\nThe purse money for the Belmont was $1,500,000, an increase of $500,000 from the 2013 race. Attendance of 102,199 was the third highest in Belmont Stakes history. The 2014 race set a record for the New York Racing Association (NYRA) for the amount of money bet, with an on-track handle of $19,105,877 and all-sources handle of $150,249,399. It had the second-highest television viewership to the 2004 broadcast.\nField.\nThe only three horses to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown were Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner California Chrome, Ride On Curlin, and General a Rod. Returning from the Kentucky Derby, having skipped the Preakness, were Commanding Curve (who was second in the Derby), Wicked Strong, Medal Count, and Samraat. \"New shooters\" who had not run in either of the previous Triple Crown races included Tonalist, Matterhorn, Matuszak, and Commissioner. Tonalist and Commissioner had run first and second at Belmont Park in the Peter Pan Stakes. Matterhorn had run fourth in that race.\nDerby runners Danza and Intense Holiday were anticipated to run but for various reasons did not. Preakness runners Kid Cruz and Social Inclusion were other possible runners who were not entered.\nRace description.\nMorning line favorite California Chrome stumbled slightly out of the gate and bumped with another horse in his bid to become the first horse to win the Triple Crown since 1978. Commissioner and General a Rod challenged for the early lead and jockey Victor Espinoza elected to ease California Chrome into third place at the first rail. California Chrome stayed back, falling to fourth then fifth as the race went on. Entering the final turn, he went outside of a surging Tonalist as the race went four horses wide. Espinoza pressed the horse, but California Chrome was unable to gain ground.\nEntering the home stretch Commissioner was still in the lead. However, Tonalist continued to surge and beat Commissioner to the line by a head, with a winning time of 2:28.52. A slight surge brought California Chrome into a dead heat for fourth with Wicked Strong, but left him 1.5 lengths behind the winner. Medal Count placed third, a length back from Tonalist. Most of the crowd had hoped to see California Chrome win and sat quietly when the race ended. Winning jockey Joel Rosario said the win was bittersweet as he had been rooting for California Chrome to win the Triple Crown. Tonalist had last raced in the Peter Pan Stakes on May 10, a race he won at Belmont Park, and was making just his fifth career start. He became the first horse to win the Peter Pan/Belmont double since A.P. Indy in 1992.\nCalifornia Chrome's loss extended the longest Triple Crown drought in history. He became the twelfth straight horse to fail in the Belmont after winning the first two legs of the contest. (A thirteenth horse, I’ll Have Another, did not compete in the Belmont due to injury.) Espinoza felt that something wasn't right with California Chrome when the horse didn't break boldly, and he held the horse back a bit instead of going to the lead. Midway through the race he took the horse to the outside to give him running room, but the horse did not unleash his usual burst of speed. \"As soon as he came out of the gate, he wasn't the same\", Espinoza remarked after the race. Initial post-race analysts thought that California Chrome had stepped on his own feet, or \"grabbed a quarter\" in equestrian parlance, as he had some blood on his right front heel. Further review of the video and photos of the race showed that the horse next to him, Matterhorn, accidentally stepped on California Chrome as both horses broke from the gate. As a result, he had run the race with a \"chunk\" of tissue taken out of his right front heel, and also had a cut on his tendon that was not serious. Trainer Art Sherman said that both injuries would heal, probably in two or three weeks, but after that, he wanted to turn out California Chrome on pasture for a rest period of six or seven weeks, adding \"Hey listen, we'll be here to fight another day, I'm just happy he's all in one piece.\"\nAfter the race, California Chrome co-owner Steve Coburn said the horses who had not taken part in the Kentucky Derby or Preakness Stakes took \"the coward's way out\". He predicted he would not see another Triple Crown winner in his lifetime due to fresh horses coming in at each stage of the contest; including Tonalist, six of the last eight Belmont winners did not compete in the first two legs of the Triple Crown. Two days later, he apologized for the remarks, saying he wanted to tell the owners of Tonalist, \"Congratulations, you've got a fantastic horse ... He won the race fair and square. He deserved to win.\"\nOther horses and their connections generated assorted pre- and post-race drama. Dale Romans, trainer of third-place finisher Medal Count, expressed concern that General a Rod, who finished seventh, was late to the test barn prior to the race, and that trainer Michael Maker had given the horse an unfair advantage by doing so. Romans thought the late arrival should have been penalized by the horse being scratched. However, New York Racing Association officials found that General a Rod completed all pre-race testing and had no unfair advantage. Further, spotty cell phone service and other communication glitches contributed to the confusion. Ride On Curlin, who was one of the other horses to contest all three legs of the Triple Crown, was eased in the stretch because he began bleeding from his lungs; he did not finish the race. Trainer Billy Gowan later said the severity was a \"three out of 10\", and that the horse recovered from the race eating well and with sound legs, but that he would give the horse a rest for at least 30 to 45 days.\nAttendance, entertainment, and betting handle.\nAttendance of 102,199 was the third highest in Belmont Stakes history, topped only by 2002 and 2004. The 2014 race day featured a total of 10 stakes races and set a record for the New York Racing Association (NYRA) for amount of money bet, with an on-track handle of $19,105,877 and all-sources handle of $150,249,399. The previous record for Belmont Park was set at the Breeders' Cup when it was held there on October 29, 2005, with on-track wagering of $14,742,520 and $124,009,593 for all sources. The previous record for Belmont Stakes day was set in 2004 with 14,461,402 on track and $110,994,390 from all sources.\nEntertainers for the day included Frank Sinatra, Jr., singing \"New York, New York\" live in the post parade, with additional performances by LL Cool J and Dee Riscoli, from the cast of \"Wicked\".\nThe three living jockeys who have won the Triple Crown—Ron Turcotte, Jean Cruguet, and Steve Cauthen—all attended, the first time all of them had appeared together in a very long time. They signed autographs, and collectively gave entrants the command \"Riders up!\" at the saddling paddock.\nPayout.\nThe 146th Belmont Payout Schedule\nFull chart.\nThe following table includes the result information:\nNotes:\n Favorite\n† Dead heat\n‡ Eased\nRace Information:"

        "text": "The 1970–71 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team was head coach Adolph Rupp's second to last team. While not as successful as his past Wildcats teams, would go reach the Sweet Sixteen, finishing the season with a 22–6 record (16–2) and a Southeastern Conference regular-season championship.\nIntegration on UK basketball team.\nThe integration process at the University of Kentucky was a lengthy process to fully complete. Starting with a teenager named Charles Eubanks; he applied to the College of Engineering, but, was denied because of his skin color. Eubanks was denied because of the Kentucky Day Law; which didn't allow black and white students to attend the same school. The lawsuit led to the creation of the \"separate but equal\" program at the Historically Black College and University of Kentucky State University. The University of Kentucky became integrated in 1949. Lyman T.Johnson was the first African-American to enroll at Kentucky; making the class of 1949 the first integrated class. In 1954, admissions at the university fully opened to undergraduate black students. Adolph Rupp was the head coach of the UK basketball team during the time of segregation within the basketball team. Rupp didn't sign a black player until 1969, even though all of the Universities athletic teams were officially desegregated. Adolph did recruit black players, but they had to be the best of best and carry no flaws. The SEC, which Kentucky played conference basketball in, didn't all black players to play; making it very difficult for black players. Rupp finally signed a black player, Tom Payne, during his second to last season; integrating the University of Kentucky basketball team.\nAdolph Rupp.\nAdolph Rupp's career at Kentucky was legendary and he is considered one of the greatest coaches in college basketball history. Rupp coached 41 seasons at UK and his record included coaching 32 All-Americans, 52 All-SEC players, 44 NBA draft picks, 2 National players of the year, 7 Olympic Gold medalists, and 4 Naismith Memorial basketball hall of fame members, However, Rupp had a lot of controversy during his career including the point-shaving scandal, lack of integration, racism, and a demanding coaching style. The 1951 point-shaving scandal, occurred while Rupp was the head coach; it involved four basketball players who were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to \"shave points\" during the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers. The NCAA voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year; canceling their 1952–53 season. Adolph Rupp was one of the early innovators of the fast break and set offense and \"guard around\" plays. His coaching style was composed of repetition, as a result, he was demanding of his players; berating his players and putting maximum pressure on them. Adolph Rupp was forced into retirement when he was 70; he later went on to coach in the ABA and later became a vice-president within the ABA.\nNCAA appearance.\nThrough the 1970s, Kentucky had the fifth-best winning percentage throughout all collegiate basketball teams in the nation. The University of Kentucky represented the Mideast division in the NCAA tournament of the 1970–71 season. Their first opponent of that year was facing the independent school of Marquette University whose record that year was 28–1 and was led by head coach, Al McGuire. Their next opponent and last would be Western Kentucky, led by John Oldham in the Sweet Sixteen; the Hilltoppers would make history that year by being the first non-historically black Kentucky college to start all black players. WKU beat UK, subsequently ending their 1970–71 basketball season.\nBreakout players.\nThe University of Kentucky basketball team didn't accomplish their end goal of winning a national championship, but they did have two breakout players and an undefeated freshman team. Mike Casey was \"Mr. Basketball\" in Kentucky and averaged 18 points per game and led the team in free-throw shooting. After the, UK he went on to be drafted by the Chicago Bulls. Larry Steele started all three of his college years and averaged 13 points, 6 rebounds, and 3.9 assists per game. Steele was selected 1st team All-SEC twice, co-caption, MVP, Leadership, and hustle awards. He later went on to be drafted by the Trail Blazers in the NBA and the Kentucky Colonels, but ultimately played for Portland and won an NBA championship in 1977. During Adolph Rupp's time as head coach, he played the freshman on a separate team from the upperclassmen. The University of Kentucky also had an undefeated freshman basketball team that year."

This event was last run at the 1956 Winter Olympics, as bobsleigh was not part of the 1960 games.\nThe winning athletes were those who posted the shortest total time over four separate runs. Canada were surprise gold medal winners, having first entered a bobsleigh team in a competitive event only 8 years previous. Favourites for the event were the Italians who finished in 3rd and 4th. Second place Austria never had an individual run which was quicker than third best, but their consistency earned them the silver medal."

The winners of the Eredivisie are recognised as the Dutch handball champions.\nCompetition format.\nIn the first phase of the season, the top 6 teams of the previous season participate in the BENE-League competition. They are joined by the top 6 teams from Belgium. At the same time, the remaining 12 teams, participate in a national competition. In the second phase, the 4 best ranking Dutch teams of the BENE-League, who automatically qualified for next season's BENE-League, compete in a 2-round system for the national title. The first round is a full competition among those 4. In the second round the 2 teams which ended on top, decide in a best-of-three who wins the title. In the final ranking, these teams end up on ranks 1 to 4. The 2 lowest ranking Dutch teams of the BENE-League, together with the 2 best ranking teams of the national competition, compete in full competition, for 2 spots in next season's BENE-League. In the final ranking, these teams end up on ranks 5 to 8. The teams which ended 3 to 10 in the national competition play a 3-round system to decide their final ranking (ranks 9 to 16). Something like a knock-out system with the major difference that losing a match doesn't mean you get eliminated but you continue for the lower ranks, where winning means you continue for the better ranks. So the teams winning in the first round continue for the final ranks 9 to 12 and those losing for the ranks 13 to 16. The same principle is repeated in the second round and final ranks are decided in the third round. Last but not least, the 2 teams who ended at the bottom of the national competition, together with 4-period winners of the Eerste Divisie compete in a 2-round system for 1 spot in next season's Eredivisie. In the first round, the 6 teams are split into 2 groups of 3 in such a way that the 2 Eredivisie teams are never in the same group. In each group, the 3 teams play a full competition. The winners of both groups decide in a best-of-two who plays next season in the Eredivisie. The final spot in the Eredivisie is taken by the champions of the Eerste Divisie.\n2020–21 season.\nThe following 16 clubs compete in the Eredivisie during the 2020–21 season.\nEHF coefficient ranking.\nFor season 2017/2018, see footnote"

        "title": "2014–15 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2014–15 Dayton Flyers men's basketball team represented the University of Dayton during the 2014–15 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Flyers, led by fourth year head coach Archie Miller, played their home games at the University of Dayton Arena and were members of the Atlantic 10 Conference. They finished the season 27–9, 13–5 in A-10 play to finish in a tie for second place. They advanced to the championship game of the A-10 tournament where they lost to VCU. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they defeated Boise State in the First Four and Providence in the second round before losing in the third round to Oklahoma.\nWhen the Flyers were selected to play at home in the First Four, they became the first team since 1987 to play an NCAA Tournament game in their home arena. The NCAA made a rule in 1989 that no team could play a tournament game in their home arena. However, with UD Arena always hosting the First Four, Dayton is the only exception to the rule.\nPrevious season.\nThe 2013–14 Dayton Flyers finished the season with an overall record of 26–11, with a record of 10–6 in the Atlantic 10 regular season for a tie for a fifth-place finish. In the 2014 Atlantic 10 tournament, the Flyers were defeated by Saint Joseph's, 70–67 in the quarterfinals. They received an at-large bid to the 2014 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament which they upset Ohio State, Syracuse and Stanford in second and third rounds and the sweet sixteen before falling to Florida in the elite eight to end their Cinderella run.\nSeason synopsis.\nThe Flyers entered the season with three players capable of playing as centers, but by the start of 2015, none of the three were available to the team. First, the NCAA declared incoming freshman Steve McElvene a \"partial qualifier\", rendering him ineligible for the entire 2014–15 season. Then, in December 2014, starting center Devon Scott and intended backup Jalen Robinson were dismissed from the team after allegedly being caught committing theft in a campus dormitory. Two other players were sidelined by injuries. Junior college transfer Detwon Rogers was lost for the season to a knee injury, and graduate transfer Ryan Bass quit basketball on medical advice due to post-concussion symptoms.\nThese departures and injuries left Dayton with arguably the most limited roster, in both depth and physical size, in Division I. The Flyers played the bulk of their season with only six players who started the season on scholarships. In January 2015, Bobby Wehrli, who had begun the season as a walk-on, was given a scholarship, but only for the spring of 2015. No one left on the active roster, whether on scholarship or not, was taller than 6'6\" (1.98 m). CBS Sports journalist Gary Parrish had this to say about the Flyers' roster limitations (emphasis in original):\"To put this into perspective, consider that Kentucky has \"seven\" scholarship players taller than \"6-8\", and that UK's starting \"backcourt\" (Andrew Harrison and Aaron Harrison) is just as tall as Dayton's starting \"frontcourt\" (Dyshawn Pierre and Kendall Pollard).\"\nDespite these limitations, the Flyers remained in contention for the A10 title for most of the season, ultimately finishing second in the regular-season standings, and advanced to the A10 tournament final, losing there to VCU.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C40023; color:white;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C40023; color:white;\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C40023; color:white;\"| Atlantic 10 regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C40023; color:white;\"| Atlantic 10 tournament\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#C40023; color:white;\"| NCAA tournament\nSee also.\n2014–15 Dayton Flyers women's basketball team"

        "title": "Belgium at the UEFA European Championship",
        "text": "The UEFA European Championship is the main football competition of the men's national football teams governed by UEFA (the Union of European Football Associations). Held every four years since 1960, in the even-numbered year between World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the UEFA European Nations Cup, changing to the current name in 1968. Starting with the 1996 tournament, specific championships are often referred to in the form \"Euro 2008\" or whichever year is appropriate. Prior to entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process.\nBelgium have participated in six UEFA European Championships finals, those held in 1972, 1980, 1984, 2000, 2016, and 2020, which was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of 2 July 2021, they have played 22 matches: eleven wins, two draws and nine losses.\nOverview.\nOverall record.\n Champions   Runners-up   Third place   Fourth Place\nEuro 1972.\nBelgium hosted the European Championship twice, as they were chosen amongst the four semi-finalists to host the event, and ended third by beating Hungary.\nEuro 1980.\nUnder the guidance of manager Guy Thys, Belgium achieved their best European result at the 1980 edition in Italy. After finishing first in the group phase, before football nations Italy, England and Spain, Belgium stood in the final against West Germany. After the German opener from Horst Hrubesch and the penalty equalizer from René Vandereycken, the match seemed to go in extra time. Two minutes before the end of the regular playing time, Hrubesch's second goal ended the Belgian dream of winning a first major (non-Olympic) tournament.\nKnockout stage.\nFinal\nEuro 1984.\nAt UEFA Euro 1984 the road to the knockout stage seemed open after taking a 2–0 lead in their last group match against Denmark, but the Red Devils could not prevent \"Danish Dynamite\" to turn the tide in their favour.\nEuro 2000.\nThe Belgian team was one of the major disappointments of the 2000 edition with a first-round exit. This early exit was fairly unexpected since during the eight preparational friendlies for Euro 2000 under Robert Waseige Belgium played well, winning three times convincingly and losing only once (2–1 against England). At Euro 2000, Belgium first won against Sweden 2–1 via goals from Bart Goor in the 43rd minute and Émile Mpenza in the 46th minute against Sweden's one by Johan Mjallby in the 53rd minute after a terrible error of goalkeeper Filip De Wilde. In the second match, Belgium lost 2–0 against the eventual tournament runners-up Italy by a header from Francesco Totti in the fifth minute and Stefano Fiore's goal of the tournament (according to the United Kingdom's \"Match of the Day\" television programme) in the 66th minute. In the crucial match where Belgium needed one more point to move ahead to the quarter-finals, they lost 2–0 against Turkey (two goals from Hakan Şükür in the 45th after another error of goalkeeper Filip De Wilde, and 70th minute). In the 83rd minute of that last group match, De Wilde even ended his tournament, being sent off for attacking Arif Erdem outside the penalty area.\nEuro 2016.\nJust like in Belgium's previous Euro tournament in 2000, they lost 2–0 to Italy in the group phase. In spite of winning with broad margins against the Republic of Ireland (3–0) and Hungary (4–0) at UEFA Euro 2016, Belgium's second very talented generation disappointed with a quarter-final exit. As during the tournament's qualifiers, Wales got the better of Belgium, with a 3–1 win.\nKnockout phase.\nRound of 16\nQuarter-finals\nEuro 2020.\nKnockout phase.\nRound of 16\nQuarter-finals"

The team was led by future Basketball Hall of Fame head coach Larry Brown.\nThe Americans were favored to win the gold medal, after winning the tournament the previous three Olympics. However, the team won bronze, while losing three games against its opponents, the most games ever lost by a U.S. men's Olympic basketball team.\nThe team lost its opening game to Puerto Rico by 19 points, which stands as the largest margin of defeat for the U.S. in the Olympics. It ended their 24-game Olympic winning streak since 1992, when National Basketball Association (NBA) players were first allowed to compete. The team also lost a group stage game to Lithuania and the semi-final game to Argentina.\nIn addition, the team lost a friendly preparation game prior to the Olympics, against Italy, by a score of 95–78. This was the second time that Team USA won the bronze medal, having also done so at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul.\nRoster.\nAfter the United States finished in sixth place in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, the Americans overhauled their roster for the 2003 FIBA Tournament of the Americas in Puerto Rico, where they needed to qualify for the 2004 Summer Olympics. The team cruised to a first-place finish at the Americas Championship, and earned a spot in Athens, Greece, the following summer. However, the only players from the 2003 squad to compete in the Olympics were Tim Duncan, Allen Iverson, and Richard Jefferson; the rest of the team opted out. Newcomers to the team included young players LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwyane Wade, and Emeka Okafor. The team featured just one All-NBA selection (Duncan) and two All-Stars (Duncan and Iverson) from the prior NBA season, which are both all-time lows for a U.S. Olympic team since NBA players were first allowed in 1992. Team USA was coached by Larry Brown, who was coming off a championship in the 2004 NBA Finals.\nSummary.\nThe United States struggled with its outside shooting, finishing the tournament ranked last in three point field goals made (5.5 per game) and 11th in percentage (31.4) out of 12 teams. They also struggled defensively.\nThe team's loss to Puerto Rico was just the third in U.S. Olympic men's basketball history. Their two previous losses were both to the Soviet Union (1972 and 1988), with six having been the largest margin of defeat."

        "text": "Joseph Andrew Ross (born May 21, 1993) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Washington Nationals. The San Diego Padres selected Ross in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft (25th overall). He made his MLB debut in 2015 with the Nationals.\nCareer.\nSan Diego Padres.\nThe San Diego Padres selected Ross in the first round of the 2011 Major League Baseball draft (25th overall) out of Bishop O'Dowd High School in Oakland, California. He had committed to attend the University of California, Los Angeles, but signed with the Padres.\nHe made his professional debut for the Arizona League Padres. Prior to the 2012 season he was ranked by Baseball Prospectus as the 95th best prospect in baseball. In 2012, he pitched for the Fort Wayne TinCaps of the Class-A Midwest League but ended up missing most of the season on the disabled list with right shoulder inflammation after being unable to make a May 10 start against the South Bend Silver Hawks due to tightness.\nRoss returned for the 2013 season in Fort Wayne.\nHe started the 2014 season with the Lake Elsinore Storm of the Class-A Advanced California League. He was promoted to Double-A during the season.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn December 19, 2014, the Padres traded Ross and a player to be named later, Trea Turner, to the Washington Nationals as part of a three-team trade, in which the Padres traded Jake Bauers, Burch Smith, and René Rivera to the Tampa Bay Rays, and Washington traded Steven Souza and Travis Ott to Tampa Bay.\nOn June 6, 2015, Ross was called up to the majors for the first time and he made his major league debut that day as a starting pitcher. Ross outdueled Jimmy Nelson and A. J. Burnett in his second and third starts, respectively, earning wins for the Washington Nationals. He struck out 11 batters in his third appearance, snapping an eight-game winning streak by the Pittsburgh Pirates. On August 6, manager Matt Williams announced Ross would remain in the rotation and veteran starter Doug Fister would move to the bullpen, in recognition of the rookie's strong performance since his promotion. Ross' promotion lasted barely a month before Williams said on September 8 that reliever Tanner Roark would take over his spot in the rotation and Ross would move to the bullpen in an effort to keep him from exceeding an undisclosed \"innings limit\" for the season.\nAlthough Ross started the 2016 season in the Nationals' rotation, he lost much of the season due to right shoulder inflammation. He was placed on the disabled list on July 3, 2016, and was activated again on September 18. Upon returning from the disabled list, Ross struggled to pitch deep into games, more than once forming a tandem with rookie right-hander Reynaldo López to pitch the first few innings of a game before López took over in long relief. Ross started game 4 of the 2016 NLDS with the Nats up 2–1 in the series giving up 4 runs on 55 pitches in 2.2 innings.\nRoss was an up-and-down contributor for the Nationals in the first half of the 2017 season. He started the year pitching for the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, but after Nationals starter Jeremy Guthrie was shelled for 10 earned runs in less than an inning in what would be his only appearance of the season, Ross was called up. Upon struggling in the early going, he was optioned back to Syracuse on May 1 in favor of Jacob Turner. Ross returned to the major league rotation on May 23, pitching well against the Seattle Mariners. Through the first half of the season, Ross received more run support than any other pitcher in the major leagues, with the Nationals averaging more than 10 runs in games Ross started. Out of 13 starts by Ross at the major league level in 2017, the Nationals scored at least 10 runs in eight of them. However, in the last of these starts, against the Atlanta Braves on July 9, Ross exited in the fourth inning as the velocity of his fastball dipped so low into the mid-80s that the stadium radar gun was registering them as changeups. On July 15, 2017, medical tests confirmed that his elbow was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral ligament. It was further announced that he would undergo ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction (\"Tommy John\") surgery, ruling him out for the remainder of the season and at least part of the 2018 season. In 2017 he was 5–3 with a 5.01 ERA.\nAfter recovering from his surgery, Ross attempted to make his first MLB start in 14 months on September 7, 2018, facing the Chicago Cubs on a rainy evening at Nationals Park. The game began after a 1-hour 21-minute delay, but the teams played for only 23 minutes before the game was stopped again with two outs in the top of the second inning and the score tied 0–0. Another 2-hour 54-minute delay ensued before the game was postponed. In his -inning outing, Ross threw 24 pitches, gave up one single and hit one batter, but retired the other five Cubs he faced, and his fastball was clocked consistently at 95–96 mph, occasionally reaching 97 mph, which was better than his pre-surgery velocity. In 2018 in three games he was 0–2 with a 5.06 ERA.\nIn 2019 he was 4–4 with a 5.48 ERA. Ross started game 5 of the 2019 World Series for the Nationals in place of Max Scherzer, who was dealing with a back injury. He allowed 4 runs in 5 innings and was credited with the loss as the Astros won 7–1. Ross received a World Series ring for his efforts after the Nationals defeated the Astros in 7 games.\nOn June 29, 2020, Ross announced he would not play in the shortened 2020 season during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn August 17, 2021, Ross was placed on the injured list after suffering a partial tear of his ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow. On May 31, 2022, it was announced that Ross would require Tommy John surgery, ending his 2022 season.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nOn January 30, 2023, Ross signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants organization. He became a free agent following the season. \nMilwaukee Brewers.\nOn December 12, 2023, Ross signed a one-year deal with the Milwaukee Brewers.\nPersonal life.\nRoss has an older brother, Tyson Ross, who pitched in MLB from 2010 to 2019. His father is a pediatrician and his mother an emergency room nurse in Oakland. His sister, Frankie, is a pediatrician and played soccer at Portland State University."

Johnson was placed on administrative leave at Louisville shortly after the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal and FBI investigation into the college basketball program in September 2017 that also resulted in the firing of Pitino, athletic director Tom Jurich and assistant coach Jordan Fair. Johnson was officially fired in November 2017.\nLa Salle University hired Johnson in May 2018 to serve under the new men's basketball coach Ashley Howard. On May 11, 2020, after being named in a Notice of Allegations regarding providing benefits to a recruit at Louisville, Johnson was fired from La Salle.\nJohnson next was an assistant coach at Rhode Island under head coach Archie Miller from 2022 to 2024.

In 2014, he led his team to capture the OHL Cup and was awarded the Tim Adams Memorial Trophy as OHL Cup's most valuable player.\nMcLeod was drafted by the Mississauga Steelheads of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) in the first round (fifth overall) of the 2014 OHL Priority Selection, and played for them beginning with the 2014–15 OHL season. McLeod was named an alternate captain during the 2015–16 OHL season and named the fifth captain of the Steelheads in the following 2016–17 season.

On February 5, 2024, the London Police Service announced that McLeod had been charged with two counts of sexual assault.\nInternational play.\nMcLeod was selected as the 13th forward to the Canada national junior team for the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. After an injury to Mitchell Stephens, McLeod took his place on the active Canada roster. He was one of seven returning players for the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships.\nPersonal life.\nMcLeod is the older brother of Ryan McLeod, who is a member of the Edmonton Oilers organization after being drafted by them in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. His other brother, Matt McLeod, plays for the Belfast Giants of the British Elite Ice Hockey League. He is close friends with former Steelheads and Devils teammate Nathan Bastian."

With 8:30 remaining with a 47-46 deficit, Derrick Rose got the show going with 10 points in the next 4 minutes to take a 56-49 lead. After Robert Dozier made a pair of free throws to give Memphis a 60-51 lead with 2 minutes remaining, Kansas began a furious comeback. It started with Darrell Arthur making a 2-point jumper and Sherron Collins making a 3-pointer to cut the Memphis lead to 60-56. A pair of Mario Chalmers free throws and a Darrell Arthur basket cut the Memphis lead to 62-60. With 10 seconds left, Derrick Rose missed the first of his two free throws and made the second to give Memphis a 63-60 lead. With 2.1 seconds left, Mario Chalmers made a 3-pointer to tie the game at 63. Robert Dozier had a chance to win it, but his desperation halfcourt heave bounced off the backboard, and the game went to overtime for the seventh time in the national title game's history, and the first time since the 1997 National Title Game, when Arizona beat Kentucky 84-79 in overtime.\nOvertime.\nIn the first two and a half minutes of overtime, Brandon Rush, Darrell Arthur, and Darnell Jackson each made a basket to give Kansas a 69-63 lead. In the next minute and a half of overtime, Chris Douglas-Roberts scored 5 points to cut the Kansas lead to 71-68 with one minute remaining. Mario Chalmers and Sherron Collins each made a pair of free throws to give Kansas a 75-68 overtime victory over Memphis and Kansas' first national championship since 1988.\nAftermath.\nMemphis would have its entire season vacated due to problems with Derrick Rose's SATs. On March 30, 2009, John Calipari became the head coach at Kentucky. \nKansas would return to the national championship game in 2012, but they would narrowly lose to Kentucky. The Jayhawks would win their next national title in 2022."

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the men's national teams of the members of \"Fédération Internationale de Football Association\" (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nBulgaria has appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on seven occasions, the first being at the 1962 tournament. They appeared in the FIFA World Cup subsequently in 1966, 1970, 1974, 1986, 1994 and 1998. Their best performance was in 1994, where they finished in fourth place. They have failed to qualify for a FIFA World Cup since 1998.\nRecord at the FIFA World Cup.\nBulgaria's first appearance at the World Cup was at the seventh edition of the tournament in 1962. Between 1962 and 1974, they participated at four consecutive World Cup tournaments but did not survive the first round. Their best result followed in 1994, where they reached the semi-finals.\nTournament Summary.\n1970 FIFA World Cup.\nAll times local (UTC−6)\nAssistant referees:\nAbel Aguilar Elizalde (Mexico)\nYoshiyuki Maruyama (Japan)\nAssistant referees:\nGuillermo Velasquez (Colombia)\nAntonio Saldanha Ribeiro (Portugal)\nAssistant referees:\nTofiq Bahramov (Soviet Union)\nLaurens van Ravens (Netherlands)\n1986 FIFA World Cup.\nBulgaria qualified for the World Cup in Mexico by finishing second in Group Four, behind France with 11 points, but worse goal difference, ahead of the teams of Yugoslavia, East Germany, and Luxembourg. This was their fifth World Cup appearance. They were drawn in Group A with Italy, Argentina, and South Korea. In the opening match of the World Cup, the Bulgarians held the defending champions Italy to a 1–1 draw. Alessandro Altobelli gave the Italians the lead, but an 85th-minute equalizer by Nasko Sirakov gave the Bulgarians the point. The next match was another 1–1 draw against South Korea with the goal for Bulgaria coming from Plamen Getov in the 11th minute. They lost the final match of the group 2–0 against Argentina, who ended up winning the tournament. Despite not recording a win, the Bulgarians advanced to the knockout stage by being the third-best third placed team. That way, Bulgaria and also Uruguay became the first nations to qualify for the knockout stage without winning a game in the first round. In the Round of 16, they faced World Cup hosts Mexico and lost the match 2–0. Ivan Vutsov was the manager of the team.\n1994 FIFA World Cup.\nCertainly one of the most important dates in Bulgarian football history is 17 November 1993, when Emil Kostadinov scored two goals to beat France in Paris, allowing Bulgaria to qualify for the World Cup in the United States in 1994. Under the management of Dimitar Penev, the Bulgarians, led by players such as Hristo Stoichkov, Yordan Letchkov, and Krasimir Balakov — along with a multitude of other talented players remembered in Bulgaria as the \"Golden Generation\" — made a strong impression by reaching the semi-finals. They entered Group D with Argentina, Nigeria, and Greece. Before that, the Bulgarians hadn't won a single match in five World Cup finals appearances. The first match ended with a 3–0 defeat by Nigeria. Despite the bad start, the team won 4–0 against World Cup-debuting featherweights Greece and 2–0 against Argentina. Argentina had actually been winning the group going into injury-time. A 91st-minute strike from Nasko Sirakov, however, meant that they dropped two places and finished third. Bulgaria continued to the next round, where they faced Mexico. The match ended 1–1 and after no goals were scored in extra time, penalties would decide which team would go through. Team captain Borislav Mihaylov made a good performance saving two of the penalty kicks. Bulgaria won 3–1 on penalties with Mihaylov becoming the hero for the Bulgarian team. In the quarter-finals, Bulgaria faced Germany. Lothar Matthäus scored from a penalty. The Bulgarians, however, managed to turn the game over with two goals by Hristo Stoichkov and Yordan Letchkov, giving them a 2–1 win and recording one of the most memorable wins for the team. Millions of Bulgarians celebrated this win in the Bulgarian capital city of Sofia and other Bulgarian cities. Having reached the semi-finals, this was the best Bulgarian performance in the World Cup. In the semi-finals, they lost 2–1 to Italy. The third-place match was lost to Sweden, 4–0, and Bulgaria eventually finished in fourth place. Hristo Stoichkov was awarded the Golden Boot as the top scorer in the tournament with six goals (shared with Oleg Salenko). Krasimir Balakov was named in the all-star team along with Stoichkov.\nStarting 11: GK-Mihaylov(c); RB-Kiryakov/Kremenliev, CB/SW-Hubchev, CB-Ivanov, LB-Tsvetanov; DM-Yankov, CM-Lechkov, CM-Balakov, AM/CF-Sirakov/Borimirov; CF/RW-Kostadinov, CF/LW-Stoichkov.\n\"All times local (EDT/, CDT/, PDT/)\"\nAssistant referees:\nGordon Dunster (Australia)\nEugene Brazzale (Australia)\nFourth official:\nAli Bujsaim (United Arab Emirates)\nAssistant referees:\nAbdulla Al Ghattan (Bahrain)\nRaimundo Calix Garcia (Honduras)\nFourth official:\nArturo Angeles (United States)\nAssistant referees:\nTapio Yli-Karro (Finland)\nEl Jilali Rharib (Morocco)\nFourth official:\nLim Kee Chong (Mauritius)\n1998 FIFA World Cup.\nBulgaria qualified for the World Cup in France by finishing first in the Group 5, followed by Russia. They entered the competition with a new manager Hristo Bonev, since Dimitar Penev was sacked after Euro 1996. Bulgaria drew Spain, Nigeria, and Paraguay in Group D. The first match ended in a 0–0 goalless draw against Paraguay. In the second match, the Bulgarians lost 1–0 for a second-straight World Cup to Nigeria. The final match ended with a disappointing 6–1 defeat to Spain. Following the bad results, Bulgaria finished fourth in the group, with only one point, and didn't go through the next round.

        "text": "The Arkansas Razorbacks women's basketball team represents the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas, United States in NCAA Division I women's basketball competition. The school's team currently competes in the Southeastern Conference.\nThe basketball team plays its home games in Bud Walton Arena on the University of Arkansas campus under fourth-year head coach Mike Neighbors.\nHistory.\nWomen's basketball has been a part of the fabric of the University of Arkansas for almost a century. Teams of female students took to outdoor courts and peach baskets just after the turn of the century. While the women waited until 1976 for the first varsity team to officially represent the University, these early photos show how the game captured what was then deemed “the fairer sex” in action.\nArkansas' women's basketball history can be definitively traced to the 1976-77 season when the University began keeping records. Since that time, the Razorback women's basketball team has made two SWAIAW Regional appearances, one AIAW Sweet 16 appearance, 8 NWIT and WNIT appearances, and 11 NCAA Tournament appearances including reaching the Final Four in 1998 and winning the WNIT in 1999, beating Wisconsin 67-64.\nSWC Title.\nArkansas was the first team to beat Texas and the first team to win a share, then later an outright, Southwest Conference championship besides the Lady Longhorns. In 1991, Arkansas also ended the Texas’ dominance of the SWC tournament by defeating Texas Tech for the title. These three trophies— the 1990 and 1991 regular season championships and 1991 SWC Classic tournament title—are the only SWC women’s basketball trophies in captivity outside the state of Texas.\nNCAA Final Four.\nIn 1998, Arkansas made NCAA Tournament history as the lowest seed -- #9 in the West—to advance to the Final Four. They were the first unranked team in women’s basketball history during the modern era to reach the Final Four. And, they were the lowest finishing team in conference play—tied for sixth in the SEC—to reach the Final Four. Arkansas spent two weeks in the Bay Area. Along the way, the Razorbacks beat three conference champions—WAC, Pacific, Ivy and ACC—and three ranked teams—Hawai’i, Kansas and Duke—to face conference rival Tennessee at Kansas City.\nArkansas played all four of its pre-Final Four games on late night TV, earning the nickname of Good Morning America’s team. Every member of the team contributed to the run, starting with a 24-point effort by Karyn Karlin in the opening round win over #20 Hawai’i, 76-70. Then it was freshman Wendi Willits’ turn with a near-NCAA record six three-pointers to blow open Arkansas’ second round contest with Harvard, 82-64. In the opening round games held at Stanford, Calif., Christy Smith had zero turnovers and 16 assists.\nAt the West Regionals in Oakland, junior Sytia Messer stepped to the front as Arkansas’ leading scorer in both wins, earning herself the honor as the most outstanding player at the West Regional. Messer had 23 points as Arkansas used an impressive 54-point second half to dispatch Kansas, 79-63, in the Sweet 16. Fellow junior Treva Christensen announced herself with 14 points off the bench against Duke to earn all-tournament selection. Junior Tennille Adams was 6-of-9 with 14 off the bench including the go-ahead bucket in the closing minutes against Duke.\nSmith calmly sank four free throws in the final seconds to send Arkansas to the Final Four for the first time with a 77-72 win over ACC champion Duke.\nPostseason.\nWNIT.\nSource\nOvertime period - *\nAIAW Division I.\nThe Razorbacks made one appearance in the AIAW National Division I basketball tournament, with a combined record of 0–1."

North Carolina won the game 89–72, as Tyler Hansbrough's 18 points, Wayne Ellington's 19 points, and Ty Lawson's 21 points all led to the rout of Michigan State to win the national championship.\nBy beating Michigan State by 17, North Carolina became the 1st team since Duke in 2001 to win all their NCAA Tournament games by double digits. Also, their +121 point differential during the 2009 NCAA Tournament was the 2nd highest since the tournament expanded to 64 teams in 1985, trailing Kentucky who had a +129 point differential during the 1996 NCAA tournament."

        "text": "Brian O'Driscoll is an Irish rugby union player who has 141 caps to his name; 133 for Ireland and 8 for the British &amp; Irish Lions. He is currently the fourth most capped player in the world behind Richie McCaw, Sergio Parisse and Alun Wyn Jones. He earned his first Irish cap playing against Australia on the 12 June 1999 at Ballymore Stadium in Brisbane, before ending his international career on the 15 March 2014 against France at the Stade de France. In his 133 caps for Ireland, he has only played once of the bench; against Romania on 15 October 1999. In total, he has represented Ireland on 65 occasions in either the Five or Six Nations Championship, and have played in 4 Rugby World Cup tournaments, playing in 17 matches. He has scored 46 tries for his national side, a current record for the Irish team, and with his 5 drop goals, he has scored 245 points for Ireland.\nIn addition to Ireland, he also represented the British &amp; Irish Lions on four tours. He earned his first Lions cap against Australia as part of the 2001 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia, where he played in every test match. He was named captain for the 2005 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, but was injured just minutes into the opening test against the All Blacks. He made a formidable partnership with Welsh Centre Jamie Roberts on the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa, playing in the opening two tests of the test series. Despite the expected retirement of O'Driscoll at the end of the 2012–13 season, O'Driscoll was selected for his fourth British and Irish Lion for the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. On this tour, he played in the opening two test against the Wallabies, but was dropped for the final test, which led to much criticism for head coach Warren Gatland."

He was a fourth round selection of the Flames, 108th overall, at the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Arnold played four seasons of college hockey for the Boston College Eagles between 2010 and 2014, and was a member of the school's 2012 national championship team.\nPlaying career.\nCollege.\nA native of Needham, Massachusetts, Arnold attended and played high school hockey at Noble and Greenough School and the Boston Junior Bruins program before joining the USA Hockey National Team Development Program for the 2009–10 season. At the U-17 level, Arnold was team captain of a select team that participated in a five nation tournament in Slovakia; he was named the tournament's most valuable player. At the 2010 IIHF World U18 Championships, Arnold recorded three points in six games as National Team Development Program, representing the United States, won the gold medal. At the 2010 National Hockey League (NHL) Entry Draft, Arnold was selected in the fourth round, 108th overall, by the Calgary Flames.\nArnold committed to play college hockey at Boston College, where he joined the Eagles program in 2010. As a freshman in 2010–11, he recorded 20 points in 39 games. In his sophomore season, he joined the US National Junior Team for the 2012 World Junior Championship. Arnold recorded three goals and three assists in six games for the seventh place Americans. En route to a 36-point season with the Eagles, Arnold scored the winning goal in overtime to defeat Boston College's rival Boston University Terriers and win the 60th annual Beanpot tournament. He then capped his season with a national championship as Boston College won its final 19 games, culminating in a 4–1 victory over the Ferris State Bulldogs to win the 2012 Frozen Four tournament.\nFollowing a 35-point season in 2012–13, Arnold completed his senior season on a line with close friends Johnny Gaudreau and Kevin Hayes. Arnold was praised by both his linemates and coach, Jerry York. They lauded him as being a player who excelled in all three zones of the ice, and who sacrificed personal stats for the benefit of his linemates. Arnold finished his college season with 14 goals and 53 points. For his college career, he recorded 159 points in 144 games.\nProfessional.\nFollowing Boston College's 5–4 loss in the 2014 Frozen Four semifinal to the Union Dutchmen, Arnold joined Gaudreau – who was also a Flames draft pick – in signing their first professional contracts. Arnold signed a two-year contract worth an average of $900,000 per season. He made his NHL debut in the Flames final game of the season, a 5–1 loss to the Vancouver Canucks on April 13, 2014. Arnold thus earned him a spot on the list of players who played only one game in the NHL.\nArnold spent the entirety of the 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons playing for Calgary's AHL affiliate. He produced 24 goals and 60 points in 113 games over both seasons."

The next were Toowoomba Golf Club in August 1896 and a few months later Brisbane Golf Club in November 1896. Other clubs quickly followed: Ipswich in 1897; Bundaberg, Rockhampton and Victoria Park (in Brisbane) in 1898, and Gladstone in 1899.\nThe Queensland Golf Union was formed in 1914.\nGolf Queensland was established in July 2007 from the merger of Queensland Golf Union and Women's Golf Queensland."

        "text": "Andrey Makarov (born 20 April 1993) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender. He played one game in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Buffalo Sabres.\nPlaying career.\nMakarov played major junior hockey with both the Lewiston Maineiacs of the QMJHL and the Saskatoon Blades of the WHL. He also played with the Russia men's national junior ice hockey team at both the 2012 and 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, winning silver and bronze respectively. On 14 September 2012, the Buffalo Sabres of the National Hockey League (NHL) signed Makarov as an undrafted free agent to a three-year entry-level contract, but assigned him to continue his play in the WHL with the Saskatoon Blades. Playing with the Blades during the 2012–13 season, Makarov was awarded the Hap Emms Memorial Trophy as the most outstanding goaltender at the 2013 Memorial Cup. In 115 career WHL games with Saskatoon, Makarov went 66-38-7 with a .916 save percentage, a 2.80 goals against average (GAA), and nine shutouts.\nMakarov made his professional debut on 1 November 2013 with the Fort Wayne Komets of the ECHL where he played 31 games during the 2013–14 season to post a record of 15-11-4 with a .906 save percentage and a 2.79 GAA. He was recalled to the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL) on 17 March 2014, where he played 6 games before receiving his first NHL call-up, on 8 April 2014, to join the roster of the Buffalo Sabres.\nMakarov opted to leave for the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) for the 2016–17 season. Among the factors for his decision to leave the Sabres organization was that he believed Tim Murray, the Sabres' general manager, held a bias against Russian players; Makarov noted that, at the time of his departure, he was the only Russian in the Sabres' entire farm system, after Murray had traded away fellow Russians Mikhail Grigorenko and Nikita Zadorov. Makarov signed a two-year deal with HC Spartak Moscow.\nBefore appearing in a game with CSKA, Makarov was acquired by Chinese entrant, HC Kunlun Red Star on 5 July 2017. He appeared in their inaugural season, posting a .912 save percentage in 29 games in the 2016–17 regular season. On 10 May 2017, Makarov was returned to CSKA before he was swiftly traded to HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk in exchange for financial compensation.\nIn his second season with Nizhnekamsk in 2018–19, earning just one win in six games, Makarov left the club to sign with Avtomobilist Yekaterinburg on 23 November 2018."

        "title": "History of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup",
        "text": "The ICC Men's T20 World Cup (earlier known as ICC World Twenty20) was first held in 2007. It was first decided that every two years an ICC T20 World Cup tournament is to take place, except in the event of an ICC Cricket World Cup being scheduled in the same year, in which case it will be held the year before. The first tournament was in 2007 in South Africa where India defeated Pakistan in the final. Two Associate teams had played in the first tournament, selected through the 2007 ICC World Cricket League Division One, a 50-over competition. In December 2007 it was decided to hold a qualifying tournament with a 20-over format to better prepare the teams. With six participants, two would qualify for the 2009 World Twenty20 and would each receive $250,000 in prize money. The second tournament was won by Pakistan who beat Sri Lanka by 8 wickets in England on 21 June 2009. The 2010 ICC World Twenty20 tournament was held in West Indies in May 2010, where England defeated Australia by 7 wickets. The 2012 ICC World Twenty20 was won by the West-Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka at the finals. For the first time, a host nation competed in the final of the ICC World Twenty20. There were 12 participants for the title including Ireland and Afghanistan as 2012 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. It was the first time the World Twenty20 tournament took place in an Asian country. Pakistan was the only team to reach the last four in the first four editions of the tournament. 2014 saw the expansion to 16 teams featuring three teams making their debuts. Sri Lanka yet again made it to the Finals this time winning after their two other appearances in previous finals. The ICC Men's T20 World Cup has had five champions from six tournaments.\nBackground.\nWhen the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup ended in 2002, the ECB needed another one day competition to fill its place. Cricketing authorities were looking to boost the game's popularity with the younger generation in response to dwindling crowds and reduced sponsorship. It was intended to deliver fast-paced, exciting cricket accessible to thousands of fans who were put off by the longer versions of the game. Stuart Robertson, the marketing manager of the ECB, proposed a 20 over per innings game to county chairmen in 2001 and they voted 11–7 in favour of adopting the new format.\nRegional tournaments.\nThe first official Twenty20 matches were played on 13 June 2003 between the English counties in the Twenty20 Cup. The first season of Twenty20 in England was a relative success. The first Twenty20 match held at Lord's, on 15 July 2004 between Middlesex and Surrey, attracted a crowd of 27,509, the largest attendance for any county cricket game at the ground other than a one-day final since 1953.\nSoon after with the adoption of Twenty20 matches by other cricket boards, the popularity of the format grew with unexpected crowd attendance, new regional tournaments such as Pakistan's Faysal Bank T20 Cup and Stanford 20/20 tournament and the financial incentive in the format. West Indies regional teams competed in what was named the Stanford 20/20 tournament. The event was financially backed by billionaire Allen Stanford, who gave at least US$28,000,000 funding money. It was intended that the tournament would be an annual event. A spin-off tournament, the Stanford Super Series was held in October 2008 between Middlesex and Trinidad and Tobago, the respective winners of the English and Caribbean Twenty20 competitions, and a Stanford Superstars team formed from West Indies domestic players. On 1 November, the Stanford Superstars played England in what was expected to be the first of five fixtures in as many years with the winner claiming a US$20,000,000 in each match.\nIndian Premier League (IPL) is a Twenty20 cricket tournament where 8 city based franchise teams from India participate for the title. The tournament started in 2008 and from then it usually takes place every year in the months of April to June. IPL is the most-watched Twenty20 cricket league in the world and also known for its commercial success. During the sixth IPL season (2013) its brand value was estimated to be around US$3.03 billion. Live rights to the event are syndicated around the globe, and in 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on YouTube.\nTwenty20 Internationals.\nOn 17 February 2005 Australia defeated New Zealand in the first men's full international Twenty20 match, played at Eden Park in Auckland. The game was played in a light-hearted manner – both sides turned out in kit similar to that worn in the 1980s, the New Zealand team's a direct copy of that worn by the Beige Brigade. Some of the players also sported moustaches/beards and hair styles popular in the 1980s taking part in a competition amongst themselves for \"best retro look\", at the request of the Beige Brigade. Australia won the game comprehensively, and as the result became obvious towards the end of the NZ innings, the players and umpires took things less seriously – Glenn McGrath jokingly replayed the Trevor Chappell underarm incident from a 1981 ODI between the two sides, and Billy Bowden showed him a mock red card (red cards are not normally used in cricket) in response.\nInaugural tournaments.\n2007.\nThis was the first World Twenty20, where 12 teams participated, divided into four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. Besides the 10 full members, Kenya and Scotland were the other two teams participating in this tournament that was played on three different grounds, Wanderers, Kingsmead and Newlands. The tournament was a huge success. It had everything required for top quality entertainment, including the world's best players and packed out stadiums. The tournament got underway with a stunning display of power hitting from Chris Gayle against South Africa. He clouted 117 off 57 balls, including 10 sixes. Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini- nobody was spared. If this wasn't enough, Yuvraj Singh achieved cricketing nirvana by hitting England's Stuart Broad for six sixes in an over, during a barnstorming and unlikely 12-ball fifty. It wasn't entirely all batsmen-led action however, as Brett Lee claimed the first hat-trick in Twenty20 internationals, for Australia against Bangladesh. The breathless tournament culminated in a final that thrilled from start to finish, as India and Pakistan battled it out for the trophy. The match went down to a final-over thriller, with Pakistan needing six from the last four balls. But India eventually triumphed as Misbah-ul-Haq's attempted scoop off Joginder Sharma landed in the hands of Sreesanth at short fine-leg. Mathew Hayden was the top run getter with 265 runs and Umar Gul took the most wickets, 13. Craig McMillan hit 13 sixes in the tournament, highest by any player.\n2009.\nFormat in this tournament was same as the first one: four groups of three, then two groups of four in quarter-finals; top two into semi-finals. This competition was played in London, Lord's and Oval, and Nottingham. Out of the 10 full members, Zimbabwe withdrew its participation. Ireland, Netherlands and Scotland qualified for the tournament. It was full of surprise victories, as favourites fell at the hands of underdogs. The hosts, England, set the ball rolling in the first match of the tournament as they were embarrassed by Netherlands in a final-ball thriller. Australia were dominated by West Indies, largely thanks to a thunderous innings by Chris Gayle, as he hit 88 off 50 balls, including some of the largest sixes seen in England. Australia were then defeated by Sri Lanka, who bowled tightly and batted with dominance, including quick-fire half centuries from Tillakaratne Dilshan and Kumar Sangakkara. Ireland beat Bangladesh in the Group stage to qualify for the Super Eight. Previous champions, India, lost all its matches of the Super Eight Stage. South Africa hadn't lost a group stage match going into the semi-finals against Pakistan, but Shahid Afridi produced a match winning performance with both bat and ball. He blasted his way to 51 and bagged two wickets for 16 runs to secure victory. The final at Lord's was a repeat of a group stage match between Sri Lanka and Pakistan; the latter lost the previous encounter. Pakistan managed to remove Dilshan, the Player of the Series for his 317 runs, without scoring, which had a big impact on the Sri Lanka innings. Sangakkara put up a fight scoring an unbeaten 64, but a target of 138 wasn't going to be easy to defend. Afridi proved this to be correct, hitting an unbeaten 54, which helped Man of the Match Pakistan win the trophy with 8 balls to spare.\nUmar Gul was the top wicket taker with 13 wickets, a repeat performance of 2007 edition. Yuvraj Singh hit the most sixes in the tournament.\n2010.\nThe West Indies hosted the third World Twenty20 a little over eight months after the previous tournament. The format in this tournament too same as in the previous two. The 12 teams consisted of the ten full members and two associates. England proved the surprise package, winning their first major limited-overs trophy with a comprehensive victory over Australia in the final. The Australians had provided amazing fireworks in the semi-final when Pakistan appeared on course for a second final only for Michael Hussey to smash 26 from five deliveries (in a 24-ball 60 not out) to win the game with a ball to spare. The significant strugglers were India and South Africa; one disturbed by the short ball, the other unable to pace a run chase. In this edition too, India lost all the three matches of the Super-8 stage. To the frustration of the commercial gurus in the game, India's elimination before the semi-finals again meant lost revenue. The two Associates – Ireland and Afghanistan – far from disgraced themselves. Mahela Jayawardene scored 302 runs, maximum in this edition of World T20. Dirk Nannes, the Dutch bowler who later qualified for Australian selection was the highest wicket taker with 14 wickets. Cameron White with 12 sixes topped the number of sixes chart.\nExpansion to 16 teams.\n2012.\nThe 2012 edition was to be expanded into a 16 team format however this was reverted to 12. It was the first time the tournament took place in an Asian country, hosted by Sri Lanka in three cities; Colombo, Pallekele and Hambantota. It was played by the same 12 teams that played in the 2010 tournament, Ireland and Afghanistan and the ten full members. For the first time, a host nation managed to get on to the knock-out stage of the ICC World Twenty20. However the tournament was won by the West Indies, by defeating Sri Lanka by 36 runs. It was by the virtue of the power packed 78 scored by Marlon Samuels the followed some tight bowling by the slow bowlers. Ironically West Indies qualified for the Super-8 stage without winning even a single match in the initial round. Pakistan and Australia were the losing semi-finalists, with Pakistan making into last four on all the occasions and Australia missing only in 2009. India won both the matches of the first round becoming the only team not to lose even a single first round match in the first four editions of the ICC World Twenty20. Shane Watson topped the run charts with 249 runs. Chris Gayle struck 16 sixes, maximum by any player. Ajantha Mendis topped wickets chart with 16 wickets, including an all-time best performance of 6 for 8 against Zimbabwe\n2014.\nThe 2014 tournament, held in Bangladesh was the first to feature 16 teams including all ten full members and six associate members who qualified through the 2013 ICC World Twenty20 Qualifier. However the top eight full member teams in the ICC T20I Championship rankings on 8 October 2012 were given a place in the Super 10 stage. The remaining eight teams competed in the group stage, from which two teams advance to the Super 10 stage. Three new teams (Nepal, Hong Kong and United Arab Emirates) made their debut in this tournament. The tournament was won by Sri Lanka, who convincingly beat India by 6 wickets with 13 balls to spare. Imran Tahir of South Africa and Virat Kohli of India were the highest wicket taker and run scorer respectively."

        "text": "Vladimir Eduardovich Tkachev (; born October 5, 1995) is a Russian professional ice hockey left winger who currently plays for Avangard Omsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).\nPlaying career.\nTkachev was drafted by Avangard Omsk in the third round, 73rd overall, in the 2012 KHL Draft. He then began his career playing for the club's MHL affiliate, Omskie Yastreby. The following year, at the age of 17, he was selected by the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in the first round, 39th overall, in the 2013 CHL Import Draft. He soon after made his professional hockey debut with Avangard Omsk during the 2013–14 KHL season, playing two games with the club before being returned to Omskie Yastreby. Partway through the 2013-14 season, an IIHF transfer agreement was made between the CHL and the KHL for Tkachev to play with the Moncton Wildcats. Roger Shannon, the Director of Hockey Operations for the Wildcats, stated that it was to be \"an exciting day to see this young superstar in a Wildcats jersey.\"\nJunior hockey.\n2013–14 season.\nTkachev debuted with the QMJHL's Moncton Wildcats on January 23, 2014. He scored four points that night and was named the game's first star in a 7-4 victory against the Chicoutimi Saguenéens. Wildcats coach Darren Rumble identified him as an \"elite player\" after his debut. He finished the 2013-14 QMJHL season with 10 goals and 20 assists for 30 points in 20 games. In his first QMJHL playoff campaign he scored 7 goals and 2 assists in 6 games.\nEdmonton Oilers contract annulment.\nAs an 18-year-old player, Tkachev was eligible for the 2014 NHL Entry Draft but went undrafted despite being listed 60th overall on the NHL Central Scouting Services' final 2014 North American skaters list. He was, however, invited to the Edmonton Oilers' training camp later that year. His performance in their training camp impressed the Oilers, and he was quickly signed to a three-year entry-level contract with the team. Oiler fans immediately anointed him \"Vladdy Hockey\" as a direct comparison to \"Johnny Hockey\" Gaudreau, a star player who plays for rival Calgary. The National Hockey League, however, rejected the contract, informing the Oilers that Tkachev was ineligible to be signed by any NHL team until the 2015 off-season because the Collective Bargaining Agreement stated that CHL players needed to play a full season in North America to be eligible if undrafted. The Oilers admitted not realizing that this clause existed, and Tkachev remained unsigned. He promptly returned to the Moncton Wildcats to continue his QMJHL career.\n2014–15 season.\nThe 2014-15 season began with great success for Tkachev as he scored nine points in his first five games, more points in that timeframe than anyone who was drafted in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft. After 13 games in the 2014-15 season he had accumulated 16 points, but on November 4, 2014, he suffered an injury and subsequently missed a month of action. Upon his return, Tkachev was traded to the Quebec Remparts for Taylor Burke in addition to a 7th and 8th round pick in the 2015 QMJHL Entry Draft. The decision was made on the basis that the Wildcats needed to readjust their roster for the future and to allow Tkachev an opportunity to play in the 2015 Memorial Cup, as the Quebec Remparts were slated to host the event. The Wildcats' Roger Shannon expressed his gratitude to Tkachev for \"adding a spark\" to the organization and thanked him for his time as a member of the team. In January 2015, the NHL's Central Scouting Services ranked him 121st overall with questions looming regarding his height and small 163-lb frame.\nWith the Quebec Remparts, Tkachev scored 12 goals and 21 assists in 33 games to help the team qualify for the 2015 QMJHL playoffs. During the playoffs, Tkachev scored six goals and 10 assists for 16 points in 21 games. The Remparts reached the QMJHL Final against the Rimouski Oceanic but were ultimately defeated in the seventh game of the seven-game series. As the host team for the 2015 Memorial Cup, the Remparts automatically qualified for that event. In the Memorial Cup, the Remparts were defeated in the semi-final against the Kelowna Rockets.\nThe NHL Central Scouting Services ranked Tkachev 159th overall in its final April 2015 rankings.\nProfessional.\nTkachev opted to return to his native Russia to resume his professional career after his KHL right's were traded by Avangard to SKA Saint Petersburg on September 12, 2015. He later agreed to a two-year playing contract with SKA ten days later on September 22.\nAt the conclusion of his second productive season with Salavat Yulaev Ufa in 2018–19, Tkachev while in need of a new contract could not agree to terms with Ufa. On June 3, 2019, his rights were traded from Salavat back to SKA Saint Petersburg in exchange for the rights to Nikita Soshnikov. He was later signed to a two-year contract through 2021 with SKA on July 10, 2019.\nOn May 29, 2021, Tkachev as a free agent left SKA, and signed a one-year, entry-level contract with the Los Angeles Kings of the NHL. In his first professional North American season, Tkachev made the Kings opening night roster for the season out of training camp. He made his long awaited NHL debut registering 2 assists in a season opening 6-2 victory over the Vegas Golden Knights on 14 October 2021. Tkachev made 3 further appearances with the Kings before he was re-assigned to AHL affiliate, the Ontario Reign, for the remainder of the season, collecting 7 goals and 29 points through 41 games.\nWith limited opportunity with the Kings, in the off-season Tkachev's KHL rights were traded from SKA Saint Petersburg back to original club, Avangard Omsk, in exchange for financial compensation. He was signed to a two-year contract to rejoin Avangard Omsk on 20 June 2022."

The competition got underway on the weekend of 17 October 2014 with the first round of the pool stage, and ended with the final on 2 May 2015 at Twickenham Stadium, London, England.\nToulon were the champions having beaten Clermont 24–18 in a repeat of the 2013 Heineken Cup Final.

Following the draw, the fixtures were announced as follows:\nWasps won the play-off 50–35 on aggregate and qualified for the Champions Cup.\nTeam details.\nBelow is the list of coaches, captain and stadiums with their method of qualification for each team.\nSeeding.\nThe 20 competing teams were seeded and split into four tiers; seeding was based on performance in their respective domestic leagues.\nFor the purpose of creating the tiers, Aviva Premiership clubs were ranked only according to their finishing positions in the League table, and not based on performance in the knockout phase of the season, while Top 14 and Pro12 clubs were ranked based on their League performances and on their qualification for the knockout phases of their championships, so a losing quarter-finalist in the Top 14 would be seeded below a losing semi-finalist, even if they finished above them in the regular season.\nTeams were taken from a league and put into a tier; a draw was used to allocate two second seeds to Tier 1, the remaining team went into Tier 2. This allocation then determined which fourth seeded team entered Tier 2, while the others entered Tier 3.\nAs with the previous European competition, the Heineken Cup, teams from the same country were kept apart where possible. However, as 7 teams qualified from England, 2 pools would by necessity contain two English teams and as 6 French teams qualified, there would be one pool with two French teams. Sale Sharks and Wasps would be drawn into pools which contained one other Aviva Premiership club, and Toulouse would be drawn into a pool which contained one other Top 14 club.\nThe brackets show each team's seeding and their league (for example, \"1 Top 14\" indicates the team was seeded 1st from the Top 14).\nPool stage.\nThe draw took place on 10 June 2014, at the Stade de la Maladière in Neuchâtel.\nFixtures were announced on Thursday 14 August 2014 at 2 pm.\nTeams played each other twice, both at home and away, in the group stage, that began on the weekend of 17/18/19 October 2014, and continued through to 23/24/25 January 2015, before the pool winners and three best runners-up progressed to the quarter-finals.\nTeams were awarded competition points, based on match result. Teams receive 4 points for a win, 2 points for a draw, 1 attacking bonus point for scoring four or more tries in a match and 1 defensive bonus point for losing a match by seven points or fewer.\nIn the event of a tie between two or more teams, the following tie-breakers were used, as directed by EPCR:\nKnock-out stage.\nThe eight qualifiers were seeded according to performance in the pool stage, and competed in the quarter-finals, which were held on the weekend of 3–5 April 2015. The four top seeds hosted the quarter-finals against the lower seeds, in a 1v8, 2v7, 3v6 and 4v5 format.\nThe semi-finals were played on the weekend of 18–19 April 2015.\nThe winners of the semi-finals will contest the final, at Twickenham Stadium, on 2 May 2015."

        "title": "WrestleMania 31",
        "text": "WrestleMania 31 was the 31st annual WrestleMania professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It took place on March 29, 2015, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California. Nine matches were contested at the event, including two matches on the Kickoff pre-show.\nIn the main event, Seth Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank contract as the scheduled match between defending champion Brock Lesnar and Roman Reigns was in progress, and won the resulting impromptu triple threat match to capture the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. In other prominent matches, The Undertaker (in his first on-screen appearance since the previous year's event) defeated Bray Wyatt and John Cena defeated Rusev to win the WWE United States Championship. The event was also notable for Sting's debut match in WWE, as well as his only WrestleMania match, in which he was defeated by Triple H.\nDespite criticism for its build-up, the event received highly positive reviews from fans and critics alike; some critics called it one of the greatest WrestleManias of all time. Praise was focused on the quality of a vast majority of the matches, as well as the ending of the main event. Another point of praise were the lack of matches considered to be \"filler\" and making the most of their time, while the women's tag team match was subject to this very criticism. Retrospective criticism has been focused on Triple H's win over Sting, which was viewed as an unnecessary ode to WWE winning the Monday Night War. WWE reported that the show was the highest grossing WWE event ever, drawing a revenue of $12.6 million. The company also claimed an attendance figure of 76,976. This was also the first WrestleMania to incorporate WWE's current logo that was originally used for the WWE Network.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nWrestleMania is WWE's flagship pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event, having first been held in 1985. It was the company's first pay-per-view produced and was also WWE's first major event available via livestreaming when the company launched the WWE Network in February 2014. It is the longest-running professional wrestling event in history and is held annually between mid-March to mid-April. It was the first of WWE's original four pay-per-views, which includes Royal Rumble, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event has been described as the Super Bowl of sports entertainment. Much like the Super Bowl, cities bid for the right to host the year's edition of WrestleMania. Announced on December 9, 2013, WrestleMania 31 was scheduled to be held on March 29, 2015, at Levi's Stadium in the San Francisco Bay Area city of Santa Clara, California. It was the first WrestleMania event to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area, the sixth to be held in the state of California (after 2, VII, XII, 2000, and 21) and the sixth to be held in an open-air venue (after IX, XXIV, XXVI, XXVIII, and 29).\nThe logo for the event included a red \"play\" button. According to a \"San Jose Mercury News\" article, Vince McMahon explained that the play button highlighted the technical prowess of Silicon Valley. There were two theme songs for the event. The main theme was \"Rise\" by David Guetta featuring Skylar Grey, while the secondary theme was \"Money and the Power\" by Kid Ink. The event included live musical performances from Skylar Grey, Kid Ink, Travis Barker, and Aloe Blacc. Grammy Award winner LL Cool J appeared in the opening video package for the event.\nTravel Packages for the event went on sale on September 29 with the exclusive California Dreamin' Travel Package ranging from $5,500. The VIP Package, Platinum Premium Package, Gold Package and Silver Package was available on October 6 with prices starting from $3,250, $1,650, $1,150 and $900 respectively including tickets to WrestleMania, hotel accommodation, airfare, and other activities through WrestleMania Axxess. Individual tickets went on sale on November 15 ranging from $35 to $1,000.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised nine matches, including two on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nAt the Royal Rumble, Brock Lesnar successfully defended his WWE World Heavyweight Championship against John Cena and Seth Rollins in a triple threat match. Rollins was also the holder of the Money in the Bank briefcase, guaranteeing him a future title match at a time of his choosing. Meanwhile, the 2015 Royal Rumble match was won by Roman Reigns, granting him a main event match for Lesnar's title at WrestleMania, but also a bad reception from almost all the WWE fans, even bigger than the winner of the last Royal Rumble, Batista. On the February 2 episode of \"Raw\", due to this uncomfortable atmosphere, Reigns agreed to put his #1 contendership on the line in a match at Fastlane. Later in the night, Daniel Bryan (the biggest fan-favorite to win the Royal Rumble and face Lesnar for his title at WrestleMania) defeated Rollins to face Reigns at the event. But at Fastlane, Reigns defeated Bryan to ensure his title shot against Lesnar at WrestleMania, enraging even more almost all the WWE fans. Reigns had only two face-to-face interactions with Lesnar prior to WrestleMania, with his title match described as \"being built on whether or not he is even worthy of being in the match in the first place\". Reigns was also described as having \"experienced no adversity on his journey\", as he \"chatted with (Lesnar's manager) Paul Heyman one week, got a shirt and then, played tug o' war\" with Lesnar (a reference to the final in-ring confrontation between Lesnar and Reigns on the March 23 episode of \"Raw\" in which the two grappled with the WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt). It was acknowledged in the storyline that Lesnar's contract was set to expire not long after WrestleMania, but less than a week before the event, amid speculation that he would be returning to UFC, Lesnar signed a new WWE contract and retired from MMA.\nOn the March 2 episode of \"Raw\", Paige defeated Divas Champion Nikki Bella by disqualification in a title match after Brie Bella attacked Paige; therefore, Nikki retained the title. Brie and Nikki then continued to attack Paige in the ring until AJ Lee returned from injury and saved Paige. On the March 5 episode of \"SmackDown\", AJ defeated Brie after Paige kept Nikki from interfering in the match. On March 9, AJ and Paige were scheduled to face The Bellas at WrestleMania.\nAt Survivor Series, Sting made his first WWE appearance in the main event Survivor Series elimination match, attacking Triple H and aiding Dolph Ziggler in pinning Seth Rollins, giving Team Cena the win and causing The Authority to be out of power, which was a secondary stipulation of the match. On the January 19 episode of \"Raw\", Sting made his \"Raw\" debut, appearing backstage during the main event, a 3-on-1 handicap match between Cena and the team of Big Show, Kane, and Rollins. The lights in the arena darkened as Sting entered the stage and gestured to The Authority at ringside. The distraction allowed Cena to pin Rollins for the win, which reinstated the jobs of the recently (kayfabe) fired Ziggler, Ryback, and Erick Rowan. On January 26, Triple H challenged Sting to a \"face-to-face\" confrontation at Fastlane. On the February 9 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H again called Sting out to accept his challenge. The lights went out, and a group of Sting impersonators appeared around the arena and inside the ring, illuminated by spotlights, while a video message of Sting accepting Triple H's challenge played on the TitanTron. At Fastlane, the two brawled until Sting got control of Triple H. Sting then pointed to the WrestleMania sign in the rafters with his signature baseball bat, issuing a challenge, which Triple H accepted. Later that night, the match was confirmed.\nOn the February 23 episode of \"Raw\", a second annual André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal was scheduled for WrestleMania. Over the following month, The Miz, Curtis Axel, Ryback, Fandango, Adam Rose, Zack Ryder, Jack Swagger, Titus O'Neil, Darren Young, Big Show, Kane, Erick Rowan, Sin Cara, Damien Mizdow, Goldust, Heath Slater, Mark Henry, and The Ascension were announced as participants. On March 26, the match was set for the Kickoff pre-show. That same day, Hideo Itami won a NXT tournament at WrestleMania Axxess to earn a spot in the match.\nOn February 26, Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett was scheduled to defend his title in a multiple-man ladder match at the event, in which a storyline was made when several contenders stole the title, claiming that they won it. Between the March 2 episode of \"Raw\" and the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", R-Truth, Dean Ambrose, Luke Harper, Dolph Ziggler, Stardust, and Daniel Bryan were added to the match.\nAt Fastlane, Rusev defeated John Cena to retain the United States Championship after hitting Cena with a low blow (while the referee was distracted with Lana) and making him pass out to the \"Accolade\" submission hold. In the following weeks, Cena challenged Rusev to a rematch, which Rusev declined. On the March 2 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie McMahon decreed that Cena would not compete at WrestleMania unless Rusev agreed to a match. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", after Rusev defeated Curtis Axel, Rusev made several insulting remarks towards the US, drawing the ire of Cena. Following the insults, Cena went into the ring and placed Rusev in the \"STF\" submission hold until Rusev passed out. Cena then picked up a bottle of water, used it to revive Rusev and then placed him into the \"STF\" again. Although Rusev submitted, Cena refused to break the hold until Lana granted Cena a title rematch at WrestleMania on Rusev's behalf.\nAt Fastlane, Bray Wyatt challenged The Undertaker to a match at WrestleMania after sending messages to the Undertaker weeks prior. On the March 9 episode of \"Raw\", The Undertaker accepted Wyatt's challenge to a match at the event.\nOn the October 20 episode of \"Raw\", The Authority members Randy Orton, Kane, and Seth Rollins defeated Cena and Ambrose in a 3-on-2 handicap street fight. Immediately after the match, Rollins performed a \"Curb Stomp\" on Orton after dissension between the two. On the October 27 episode of \"Raw\", Orton performed an RKO on Rollins, thus directly defying The Authority's orders. On the November 3 episode of \"Raw\", after increasing frustration, Orton attacked Rollins during his Intercontinental Championship match against Ziggler. Orton then demanded a match with Rollins to settle their dispute, which Triple H granted in order to keep Orton on The Authority's side. Rollins won the match, and Orton then attacked the Authority before Rollins Curb Stomped him, causing a (kayfabe) injury which forced Orton to miss several months of competition. At Fastlane, Orton returned to WWE and attacked The Authority. Over the next weeks, Orton teased a renewed alliance with The Authority, before attacking Rollins after a handicap match against Reigns. On the March 12 episode of \"SmackDown\", Orton challenged Rollins to a match at WrestleMania. On the March 16 episode of \"Raw\", Rollins accepted the challenge.\nAt Fastlane, Tyson Kidd and Cesaro (with Natalya) defeated The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) (with Naomi) to win the WWE Tag Team Championship. On March 23, the new champions were scheduled to defend their titles against Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) (with El Torito), The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Big E) (with Xavier Woods), and The Usos in a fatal four-way tag team match on the WrestleMania 31 Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nBroadcasters.\nThe WrestleMania 31 Kickoff Show was hosted by Renee Young, with Booker T, Corey Graves, and Byron Saxton as analysts, while Tom Phillips and Lita served as social media correspondents. English commentators for the event were Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler, and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield. Spanish, German, French, and Italian commentators also called the matches at ringside. Lilian Garcia and Eden Stiles served as the ring announcers.\nCelebrities.\nAs is tradition, WrestleMania featured numerous appearances by celebrity guests – such as \"E! News\" host Maria Menounos, who served as a backstage interviewer. The pay-per-view broadcast was opened by Aloe Blacc performing \"America the Beautiful\". The event saw another musical performance as Skylar Grey, Travis Barker, and Kid Ink performed a medley of the two WrestleMania 31 theme songs – \"Rise\" and \"Money and the Power\". Arnold Schwarzenegger also was featured at the event, first as part of the \"Terminator Genisys\" themed grand entrance of Triple H, and later being recognized as part of the 2015 WWE Hall of Fame class as a celebrity wing inductee.\nPre-show.\nTwo matches were contested on the WrestleMania Kickoff pre-show. The first was a fatal four-way tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship between the champions Tyson Kidd and Cesaro (with Natalya), The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Big E) (with Xavier Woods), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando) (with El Torito), and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) (with Naomi). Kidd and Cesaro retained their titles after Big E suffered a Samoan splash from Jimmy Uso, followed by Cesaro throwing Uso out of the ring and scoring the pin. Also of note, Jey Uso would suffer a shoulder injury during the match, putting him out of action for several months.\nThe second pre-show match was the second annual Andre the Giant Memorial Battle Royal. Big Show won the 30-man contest by last eliminating Damien Mizdow after Mizdow had turned on and eliminated his tag team partner The Miz.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the seven-man ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship where champion Bad News Barrett defended the title against Daniel Bryan, R-Truth, Dean Ambrose, Luke Harper, Dolph Ziggler, and Stardust. Bryan won the match after he and Ziggler exchanged headbutts at the top of the ladder, causing Ziggler to fall backward and allowing Bryan to claim his first Intercontinental Championship.\nNext, Seth Rollins faced Randy Orton. During the match, both men kicked out of their finishers. Orton eventually won the match after a second \"RKO\", which was given additional elevation as Orton countered Rollins' \"Curb Stomp\" by propelling Rollins up into the air.\nAfter that, Sting and Triple H competed in a No Disqualification match. This was Sting's first official match in WWE. Midway through the match, Sting locked Triple H in his Scorpion Death Lock submission hold, which prompted Triple H's D-Generation X (DX) allies to enter the ring and attempt to interfere in the match. Sting knocked down Billy Gunn, Road Dogg, and X-Pac, countered Triple H's Pedigree and threw him to the outside, and then launched himself from the top rope onto all four men. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Sting for a near-fall and retrieved a sledgehammer from under the ring, which prompted the three original New World Order (nWo) members (Hulk Hogan, Kevin Nash, and Scott Hall) to interfere on Sting's behalf. The nWo members took out DX and Sting dropped Triple H with his Scorpion Death Drop for a near-fall. Sting then locked Triple H in another Scorpion Death Lock. Triple H tried to grab his sledgehammer, but Hogan pulled it out of his reach, causing another brawl between both factions while Triple H was still locked in Sting's submission hold. Shawn Michaels then appeared and executed Sweet Chin Music on Sting. Triple H went to pin Sting only for Sting to kick out. Triple H grabbed his sledgehammer from Gunn, while Hall tossed a Baseball Bat to Sting. A standoff ensued between Triple H and Sting as they both held weapons. Sting struck Triple H in the gut with his bat and struck Triple H's sledgehammer which snapped in half. Sting then trapped Triple H in the corner and landed his Stinger Splash. When Sting went for another Stinger Splash, however, Triple H struck Sting with the sledgehammer to win the match. After the match, Triple H and Sting shook hands in the ring while the commentary team speculated that the rivalry between WWE and WCW had finally been put to rest.\nDaniel Bryan was then interviewed backstage by Maria Menounos regarding his Intercontinental Championship victory, and was joined in celebration by former Intercontinental Champions Pat Patterson, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, Ricky \"The Dragon\" Steamboat, Ric Flair, and Bret Hart, who all congratulated Bryan by performing Bryan's \"Yes!\" chant together until Ron Simmons broke up the celebration with his Damn! catchphrase.\nIn the fourth match, The Bella Twins (Brie Bella and Nikki Bella) faced AJ Lee and Paige. Paige and Nikki began the bout. Most of the match saw The Bellas isolating Paige and preventing her from tagging in Lee – who the Bellas would frequently knock off the ring apron onto the floor – until Paige landed a somersault plancha to both Bellas on the outside. Paige finally tagged in Lee, who applied her \"Black Widow\" hold to Nikki, but Brie saved her sister from defeat. Paige then ran in with a big boot on Brie but was soon pushed outside the ring. Brie tripped Lee as she ran off the ropes, allowing Nikki to perform a Forearm Smash on her for a near-fall. In the climax, Paige slammed Brie into the ring steps, allowing Lee to apply the \"Black Widow\" on Nikki, who submitted.\nAfter the match, the 2015 Hall of Fame class was introduced; The Bushwhackers, Larry Zbysko, Alundra Blayze, Tatsumi Fujinami, Rikishi, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Kevin Nash were presented to the crowd, while posthumous inductees \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and Connor \"The Crusher\" Michalek were represented by family members.\nAfter that, Rusev (accompanied by Lana) defended the United States Championship against John Cena. Rusev dominated the majority of the match and overpowered Cena throughout, but Cena was able to make a comeback. The end of the match came when Lana climbed onto the ring apron and was accidentally knocked off by Rusev, who then suffered an \"Attitude Adjustment\" for Cena's pin and the title. This was Rusev's first pinfall loss in WWE since he debuted in the main roster in April 2014.\nIn the next segment, The Authority (Triple H and Stephanie McMahon) announced that WrestleMania had set a new Levi's Stadium attendance record of 76,976 and began to gloat about their accomplishments and Triple H's victory over Sting earlier in the night, which prompted The Rock to enter the ring. After a verbal exchange, McMahon insulted the Rock and slapped him across the face, taunting that he would not retaliate because he dare not hit a woman. Rock then brought UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion Ronda Rousey (who sat up front) into the ring. After Rousey told McMahon that she \"owns every ring she's in\" Rock attacked Triple H and Rousey then threw both McMahon and Triple H from the ring, first teasing an armbar on McMahon.\nIn the penultimate match, The Undertaker faced Bray Wyatt. This was Undertaker's first appearance since WrestleMania XXX. It was reported that Wyatt legitimately injured his ankle earlier in the day while preparing for the match, resulting in both men working at a slow pace. While Wyatt largely controlled the offense, Undertaker was able to execute most of his signature moves such as \"Old School\", the big boot, and \"Snake Eyes\". Late in the match, Wyatt kicked out of a \"Tombstone Piledriver\", while Undertaker kicked out of \"Sister Abigail\". In the end, Undertaker executed a second \"Tombstone Piledriver\" to win the match, extending his record to 22-1.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar (with Paul Heyman) defended the WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Roman Reigns. Within the first minute, Lesnar performed a German Suplex and an F-5 on Reigns. Lesnar also suffered two minor cuts (first on one cheek and later on the chin) after his clash with Reigns, but went on to dominate the next ten minutes with knee strikes and various Suplexes (Fisherman, German, Overhead Belly-to-Belly, Vertical and Snap), leading to Lesnar screaming \"Suplex City, bitch!\" (giving birth to his nickname \"The Mayor of Suplex City\" as well as the \"Suplex City!\" chant). Lesnar performed a second F-5 on Reigns for a nearfall. Lesnar removed his MMA gloves and slapped Reigns four times, causing him to bleed a little from the mouth. Lesnar performed three more German Suplexes and a third F-5 on Reigns for a nearfall. After a long domination from Lesnar, a turning point came around the twelve minute mark, when both men were at ringside: Reigns shoved Lesnar into a ring post, causing him to bleed from the forehead. Back to the ring, after Lesnar barely avoided a pinfall, Reigns performed three Superman Punches and two Spears for a nearfall. After Reigns attempted a fourth Superman Punch, Lesnar reversed it into a fourth F-5, but failed to follow up with a pin.\nWhile both men were still down, Seth Rollins ran down to the ring with his Money in the Bank briefcase and cashed in his contract, making the Singles match a Triple Threat match and the first time in history a Money in the Bank contract was cashed in during a match. Rollins kicked Reigns out of the ring and performed a Curb Stomp on Lesnar. After Rollins attempted a second Curb Stomp, Lesnar reversed it into an F-5 attempt, but Reigns performed a third Spear on Lesnar, saving Rollins. As Lesnar rolled out of the ring, Rollins performed a Curb Stomp on Reigns for a pinfall, winning his first WWE World Heavyweight Championship, the first world championship of his career and becoming the third heel to win in a WrestleMania main event. Aftermath, Rollins ran up to the entrance stage with his WWE World Heavyweight Championship belt and celebrated, while WWE dubbed this victory as \"The Heist of the Century\".\nReception.\nWWE claimed that the show was the highest-grossing WWE event ever at the time, drawing revenue of $12.6 million. WWE also claimed an attendance figure of 76,976. However, Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" reported an attendance of 67,000, and said during the second main card match that there were \"actually a lot of empty seats all over the stadium\", mostly in the upper deck.\nThe event received acclaim from fans and critics alike. John Powell of Canadian Online Explorer gave the event a perfect 10 out of 10-star rating, calling it \"the best Mania ever\", with the main event between Brock Lesnar, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins rated 8.5 stars out of 10. Sting vs. Triple H received the highest rating of 9 stars out of 10, and Undertaker vs. Bray Wyatt was rated 8 stars out of 10.\nIn his live report from the event, Dave Meltzer of the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" described the event as \"one of the best shows I've ever seen. Several great matches, a killer angle and very little that wasn't good\". He also praised the involvement of Ronda Rousey. Overall, he stated that WrestleMania 31 was \"one of the more balanced WrestleManias in history because there was not a bad match. But it also didn't have anything close to a match of the year or a candidate for best Mania match\".\nJack De Menezes of \"The Independent\" said, \"It will go down as one of, if not the greatest WrestleMania of all time. From NWO's reunion, to The Rock teaming up with Ronda Rousey and Randy Orton's incredible 'RKO outta nowhere', nearly every match delivered a spectacle fitting of the Grandest Stage of Them All\".\nAftermath.\nDave Meltzer reported that members of Roman Reigns' family were legitimately upset at the finish of the main event, writing that especially his father Sika was furious to the point that there was \"nearly a bad scene\".\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar wanted to invoke his WWE World Heavyweight Championship rematch clause, but was denied by new champion Seth Rollins. Lesnar responded by attacking Rollins, who escaped. Lesnar then attacked Rollins' cornermen J&amp;J Security (Jamie Noble and Joey Mercury), a cameraman, and the broadcast announcers (Booker T, John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield, and Michael Cole). As a result, Lesnar was suspended and fined by Stephanie McMahon in storyline. Byron Saxton and Jerry Lawler immediately replaced them in the broken announcer table. Tom Phillips also replaced Michael Cole as lead announcer for two weeks on the following Thursday on \"'SmackDown\".\nRollins returned later during the show, where Randy Orton requested a title shot due to beating Rollins the night before. Orton and Rollins then had a Steel Cage match for the title at Extreme Rules, where Rollins retained after interference from Kane. Due to Rollins not winning cleanly, a fatal four-way match was scheduled for Payback where Roman Reigns, Dean Ambrose, and Orton went for the title. Ambrose and Reigns were given title shots after beating Rollins on consecutive \"Raw\" shows. Rollins then defended the title against Ambrose at Elimination Chamber due to Ambrose stealing the title two weeks before the event. Rollins again retained at Money in the Bank after being demanded by The Authority to win without any form of assistance. The following night on \"Raw\", Brock Lesnar would then return to face Rollins in the main event of Battleground, and their match ended with Lesnar winning by disqualification after interference from The Undertaker. On November 4, during a match against Kane at a WWE live event in Dublin, Ireland, Rollins tore the ACL, MCL, and medial meniscus in his knee while attempting to execute a sunset flip powerbomb. The injury required surgery and it was expected to take Rollins out of action for approximately six to nine months. As a result, Rollins vacated the WWE World Heavyweight Championship the next day, ending his reign at 220 days.\nOn the \"Raw\" after WrestleMania 31, Bryan defeated Dolph Ziggler for his first successful title defense; however, after the match, Bryan and Ziggler were attacked by Barrett only for Sheamus to return and chase off Barrett before attacking Bryan and Ziggler. Bryan faced Sheamus on that week's \"SmackDown\" and lost the match by count-out when Barrett interfered. During the match, Bryan hit his head on the announce table and suffered an unplanned cut on his forehead which caused him to bleed and later acquired stitches for the wound. Two weeks later on \"SmackDown\", Daniel Bryan teamed up with United States Champion John Cena and defeated WWE Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Tyson Kidd via submission in what turned out to be Bryan's final televised match. Following the April 14 \"SmackDown\" taping, WWE pulled Daniel Bryan from wrestling on the remainder of WWE's touring of Europe as a \"precautionary measure\". Bryan's scheduled title defense at Extreme Rules on April 26 against Bad News Barrett was later cancelled as Bryan was \"medically unable to compete\". Less than a week later, WWE stopped advertising Bryan from all future live events or television tapings.\nAfter about a month off television, Bryan returned on the May 11 episode of \"Raw\". However, he announced that after having undergone an MRI, he would be out for an unknown period of time, and could possibly have to retire; the nature of his injuries were not revealed. Therefore, he relinquished the Intercontinental Championship. Ryback won Bryan's vacated WWE Intercontinental Championship at Elimination Chamber on May 31. In July, Bryan revealed that his injury was concussion-related and claimed that he had been cleared to return to the ring by external medical professionals and was waiting for WWE to clear him. After receiving further diagnostic information that convinced him retirement was necessary, Bryan announced his retirement prior to the February 8, 2016, episode of \"Raw\". On March 20, 2018, after more than two years of evaluations, reviews of his medical history and neurological and physical evaluations, Bryan was cleared by three external independent neurosurgeons, neurologists, and concussion experts, in addition to Joseph Maroon, to return to WWE in-ring competition.\nOn April 3, 2015, five days after winning at WrestleMania 31, AJ Lee retired from in-ring competition with WWE. On the April 13 episode of \"Raw\", Paige won a battle royal to become the number one contender to Nikki Bella's Divas Championship at Extreme Rules. After the match, Naomi attacked Paige, turning heel, and injuring Paige in storyline.\nIn 2017, at WrestleMania 33, Brock Lesnar defeated Goldberg to become the Universal Champion, on the same night where Roman Reigns became the second person to defeat The Undertaker at WrestleMania. On the post-WrestleMania 33 episode of \"Raw\", Paul Heyman teased a match between Lesnar and Reigns for the Universal Championship since they were the only two men to have defeated The Undertaker at WrestleMania. Over the following year, Lesnar retained the Universal Championship in various matches, including a fatal four-way match at SummerSlam against Braun Strowman, Samoa Joe, and Reigns, who Lesnar pinned to retain.\nAt Elimination Chamber in February 2018, Reigns defeated Strowman, Elias, John Cena, The Miz, Finn Bálor, and Rollins in the first-ever seven-man Elimination Chamber match to become the number one contender for the Universal Championship. In April, Lesnar had two successful, albeit controversial, televised title defenses against Reigns, first at WrestleMania 34 and then Greatest Royal Rumble inside a steel cage. Reigns eventually defeated Lesnar at SummerSlam in August, to win his first Universal Championship. On the October 22, 2018, episode of \"Raw\", however, Reigns relinquished the championship due to leukemia, a disease which he has been battling since 2007.\nFour years following WrestleMania 34, Reigns and Lesnar would clash for the third time at WrestleMania 38 in the second night's main event, for both the WWE Championship and the WWE Universal Championship to crown an Undisputed Champion and unify both titles, albeit with Lesnar portraying a fan favorite and Reigns a heel with Heyman in his corner. Reigns would win following four Spears and become the first Undisputed World Champion in WWE since Jon Moxley (then under the name Dean Ambrose) in 2016."

        "text": "The official 2014/2015 snooker world ranking points for the professional snooker players on the World Snooker Main Tour in the 2014–15 season are based on performances in ranking and minor-ranking tournaments over a two-year rolling period. Following an overhaul of the world rankings it is the first season where the tariffs are based on prize money. Rather than being awarded points according to tariffs preset by the governing body as in previous seasons, the players are now ranked by their prize money earnings in tournaments that carry ranking status. The only exception to this is when a player loses their first match: for the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons only half the money earned for the event counts towards the player's ranking,&lt;ref name=\"2013/2014 points schedule\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and for the 2014/2015 season a player will not receive any points at all for that tournament. Due to the transition to the new ranking system, the start ranks of the 2014/2015 season for the top 64 players are incongruent with the ranks of the players at the end of the previous season.\nThe rankings at the start of 2014/2015 season are determined by prize money earned in the 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 seasons and updated after every tournament carrying ranking status. As points are earned from tournaments throughout the current season, the points from the corresponding tournaments from two seasons previous are dropped. The rankings set the official seedings at the start of the season and at six further stages. The total points accumulated by the cut-off dates for the revised seedings are based on all the points up to that date in the 2014/2015 season, all of the points from the 2013/2014 season, and the points from the 2012/2013 season that have not yet been dropped. The total points from the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons set the rankings at the start of the 2015/2016 season."

        "text": "Rusty's Real Deal Baseball was a free-to-play baseball video game published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 3DS eShop. It was released in Japan in August 2013 and in North America in April 2014; the game was not released in Europe. \nThe game and its minigames are no longer available to download due to the Nintendo eShop closure on Nintendo 3DS. \nGameplay.\nThe game features baseball themed minigames, which can be purchased individually at Rusty Slugger's store, called \"Rusty Slugger's Sport Shack\". The player is given a free demo of one of the minigames, but will eventually need to pay for them. While each minigame is paid through microtransactions, players can haggle with Rusty to purchase the games for a lower price. Playing the minigames will reward players with items that can be used to haggle with Rusty, which Rusty will accept and use to fix his life problems. One of Rusty's children will tell you if the price can not be lowered any further, and if a player chooses an ineffective option of dialogue, they can reset Rusty's mood with a donut for a better approach. Players can compare minigame score with other player via StreetPass.\nThe game will intentionally keep players from trying to purchase the games for full price, but can still be purchased after multiple warnings. When a player pays for full price, Rusty's past mentor Pappy Van Poodle will give him the items awarded from the minigames instead.\nAfter the Nintendo 3DS eShop closure, you cannot buy the minigames anymore, but you can see the story in game for free.\nDevelopment.\n\"Rusty's Real Deal Baseball\" was announced in a Nintendo Direct in 2014. According to Satoru Iwata, the concept of the game was created with the theme of \"good feelings\". The game's release date was announced via Twitter, and released in Japan in August 2013 and in North America in April 2014.\nReception.\nThe game received generally favorable reviews, scoring a 74/100 on Metacritic.\nThe game was praised for the characters and humorous writing. Scott Thompson from \"IGN\" called the game \"uncharacteristically dark\" and \"surprisingly funny\". Chris Carter from \"Destructoid\" liked Rusty's unique dialogue and multiple choices of writing during haggling portions of the game. He appreciated Rusty's characteristics and storyline, and believed the game had \"awkward silliness\"."
