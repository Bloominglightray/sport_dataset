        "title": "P-class sailing dinghy",
        "text": "The P-Class is a type of small single sail dinghy, popular as a training boat for young people in New Zealand. This class is famous for being the sailing trainer vessel for many new entrants into the sport, and virtually every famous New Zealand yachtsman, including Dean Barker and Russell Coutts, learnt to sail in one. The P-Class was for many years the most common sailing boat in New Zealand.\nOrigin.\nThe P-Class was designed by New Zealand civil engineer Harry Highet as a simple vessel in which children and young people could learn to sail. It is a 2.13 metre long, slab sided, v bottom single hull, single sail Bermuda rigged dinghy, and is designed to be sailed by one person. The low aspect ratio Bermudan rig took over from a gunter rig in the 1950s. The boom overhangs the stern of the boat. It has a small deep cockpit with the rest of the hull making water tight buoyancy compartments. When capsized the boat floats very high in the water. The hull has a minimum weight of 90 lbs so is very solid. Even 40-year-old boats can be bought in good condition.\nThe first example appeared at Onerahi near Whangarei on New Year's Day, 1920. However it was not until Highet and his family moved to Tauranga in 1923 that the full potential of his design became apparent. Soon a fleet of a dozen or so boats were racing each weekend on Tauranga Harbour. The P-Class was initially known as the \"Tauranga Class\". Boats carried the letter \"P\" on their sails, to indicate they were primary trainers.\nBy 1940, an Inter-Provincial Competition had been established for the P Class, but this was held only in 1940 and 1941, before lapsing for the rest of World War Two. The competition resumed in 1945, with sailors racing for the Tanner Cup, a trophy donated by Mr George Tanner. A separate Inter-Club competition for the Tauranga Cup began at about the same time. Both competitions are still held annually.\nOriginally built of solid wood, plywood was introduced in 1956 and fibreglass hulls were allowed in 1975. Aluminium spars were introduced in 1976 and carbon fibre - composite masts, in 1998. The class is a one design class with tight building restrictions ensuring that hulls spars sails and foils are very similar in weight and dimensions. \nA beginner's boat sells for $300 NZ and a top racing boat about $3000–5000NZ. Racing boats have a full range of double sided sail controls with masts and foils made of carbon fibre, and at least 2 quality sails for different wind strengths.\nThe P class is generally sailed by boys and girls from 11 to 15. Because of its short length it is difficult to sail down wind in waves, giving the boat a tendency to nose-dive. So children develop advanced sailing skills at a young age."

        "text": "Chris Stewart (born October 30, 1987) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward. He played in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Colorado Avalanche, St. Louis Blues, Buffalo Sabres, Minnesota Wild, Anaheim Ducks, Calgary Flames, and Philadelphia Flyers. He played junior hockey with the Kingston Frontenacs of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Stewart is the younger brother of Anthony Stewart, who also played in the NHL.\nEarly years.\nStewart was the second of seven children—he has five younger sisters—born to his mother, Sue, and his father, Norman, who came from a combined Jamaican and Irish background. Stewart grew up quite poor but he still loved to play hockey and was noted for his tenacity even before reaching his full size. He and Anthony played with the North York Jr. Canadiens, and thanks to a representative of the team, his hockey was paid for entirely. He also liked football and seriously considered playing it throughout his high school years at West Hill Collegiate Institute. Growing up, Stewart became friends with fellow Toronto native hockey player Wayne Simmonds.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nPrior to the 2004–05, Stewart's older brother Anthony, who was the captain of the Kingston Frontenacs, put his reputation on the line when he asked Frontenacs General Manager Larry Mavety to give Chris the chance to try out with the Frontenacs as an undrafted free agent. Mavety complied, and Stewart made the team in training camp, allowing the brothers to play together on the same team. Initially given the position with the Frontenacs as an energetic fighting role player, Stewart took advantage of his increased playing time and had a solid rookie season, scoring 18 goals and 30 points in 64 games. Stewart played in his first OHL game on September 26, 2004, getting no points in a 4–3 loss to the Brampton Battalion. Stewart scored his first goal in the League on October 3, 2004, beating Sudbury Wolves goaltender Patrick Ehelechner in a 6–4 loss. The Frontenacs failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing in ninth place in the Eastern Conference.\nIn 2005–06, Stewart had a breakout season, as he was named as an assistant captain, while scoring 37 goals and 87 points in 62 games to finish second in team scoring, helping Kingston to a playoff berth. In six playoff games, Stewart had two goals, as the Frontenacs lost to the Sudbury Wolves in the first round of the playoffs.\nThat summer, Stewart was drafted 18th overall in the first round of the 2006 NHL Entry Draft by the Colorado Avalanche.\nOn October 13, 2006, the Frontenacs revealed Stewart as the new captain of the team for the 2006–07 season at the Kingston Memorial Centre before a game against the Guelph Storm. Stewart had another solid season with Kingston, as he had 36 goals and 82 points in 61 games, finishing second in team scoring once again. In the post-season, Stewart had four goals and six points in five games, as the Frontenacs lost to the Oshawa Generals in the opening round of the playoffs.\nProfessional.\nColorado Avalanche.\nStewart made his professional debut with the Albany River Rats of the American Hockey League (AHL) at the end of the 2006–07 season. He played his first game with the team on April 4, 2007, getting no points in a 3-2 loss to the Springfield Falcons. Stewart recorded his first point, an assist, on April 6, 2007, as Albany defeated the Binghamton Senators 7-3. He then scored his first professional goal on April 14, 2007, as Stewart scored on Corey Crawford of the Norfolk Admirals in a 6-5 loss. In the playoffs, Stewart appeared in one game, getting no points, as the River Rats lost to the Hershey Bears in the first round.\nIn 2007–08, the Avalanche moved their AHL affiliate to Cleveland, Ohio, and renamed the team to the Lake Erie Monsters. Stewart spent the entire season with Lake Erie, scoring a team-high 25 goals, while finishing third in points with 44. Lake Erie, however, missed the playoffs. Stewart recorded a hat-trick on November 17, 2007, scoring three times on Toronto Marlies goaltender Justin Pogge in a 5–3 Monsters victory.\nStewart began the 2008–09 season with the Monsters, appearing in 19 games, scoring five goals and 11 points. He was then called up to the Colorado Avalanche on December 5, 2008.\nStewart played in his first NHL game that same night, getting no points and a –1 plus-minus rating in 7:29 ice time in the Avalanche's 2–1 shootout loss to the Dallas Stars. On December 9, 2008, Stewart scored his first career NHL goal, a shorthanded goal against Jason LaBarbera of the Los Angeles Kings, and added an assist in a 6–1 victory. On January 21, 2009, he earned his first ever Gordie Howe hat trick, which is a goal, an assist and a fight in the same game, in a 6–5 loss to Los Angeles. Stewart finished the 2008–09 season with 11 goals and 19 points in 53 games with Colorado, though the team failed to qualify for the 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nStewart saw very little time with Lake Erie in 2009–10, appearing in just two games with the Monsters, earning no points. He spent the majority of the season with the Avalanche, and on December 2, 2009, Stewart had another Gordie Howe hat trick while recording his first three-point game in a 6–5 shootout loss to the Florida Panthers. On March 6, 2010, Stewart recorded his first career hat trick against the St. Louis Blues in a 7–3 win, scoring two goals against Chris Mason, followed by a penalty shot goal against Ty Conklin, while adding an assist to finish with a career-high four points in a game. He finished the season leading the Avalanche with 28 goals, while finishing second in team scoring with 64 points, helping the club into the 2010 playoffs. Stewart played in his first Stanley Cup playoff game on April 14, 2010, scoring a goal with 50 seconds left in the game against Evgeni Nabokov of the San Jose Sharks in a 2–1 Colorado win. Stewart finished the playoffs with three goals in six games as the Avalanche eventually lost to the Sharks in the first round of post-season.\nIn the off-season, Stewart signed a two-year contract with the Avalanche, and began the 2010–11 season with Colorado. On October 28, 2010, he earned his second career hat trick in a 6–5 Avalanche win over the Calgary Flames, scoring all three goals against Henrik Karlsson. On February 19, 2011, the Avalanche traded Stewart, Kevin Shattenkirk and the Avalanche's second-round draft pick in 2011 to the St. Louis Blues for Erik Johnson, Jay McClement and the Blues' first-round pick in 2011. He finished with 13 goals and 30 points in 36 games with Colorado.\nSt. Louis Blues.\nStewart finished the 2010–11 season with the St. Louis Blues and made an immediate impact in his debut with the team on February 19, 2011, scoring two goals against Timo Pielmeier in a 9–3 rout over the Anaheim Ducks. He finished with 15 goals and 23 points in 26 games with the Blues, though St. Louis failed to qualify for the 2011 playoffs.\nDuring the following 2011–12 season, Stewart struggled to reproduce his scoring prowess for the Blues. Unable to adjust to the defensive tactics of renowned Head Coach Ken Hitchcock, he was increasingly subject to trade rumours whilst used in a diminished checking role and relegated as a healthy scratch during parts of the 2012 playoffs. Stewart finished with 15 goals and 30 points in 79 games before he opted to re-sign to a one-year deal in hopes to rebound with the Blues.\nWith the commencement of the 2012–13 NHL lockout, Stewart signed a one-month contract, alongside childhood friend Wayne Simmonds, to play with the Eispiraten Crimmitschau of the 2nd Bundesliga in Germany on September 24, 2012. Becoming the most established NHL players in ETC Crimmitschau history, Stewart scored five goals and 11 points in nine games before he and Simmonds declined to extend their optional stint. Whilst opting to remain in Europe alongside Simmonds, Stewart signed to another lockout contract in the more competitive Czech Extraliga with HC Bílí Tygři Liberec on October 23, 2012. With the intention of playing alongside Simmonds and former NHLer Petr Nedvěd failing to materialize, and after five unfruitful games with Liberec, Stewart decided to return to Crimmitschau for the remainder of the lockout on November 13, 2012. Just under a month later, with new-found optimism of the lockout's end in sight and on advice to prevent injury, Stewart was released on his request from the remainder of his contract on December 7, 2012. He returned to North America having scored 20 points in just 15 games for the German club.\nIn the 2013–14, Stewart was named First Star of the Week on December 23, 2013, for his performance in the week ending December 22, after earning six goals and one assist.\nBuffalo Sabres, Minnesota Wild and Anaheim Ducks.\nThe Blues traded Stewart on February 28, 2014, along with Jaroslav Halák, William Carrier, a first-round draft pick in 2015, and a conditional draft pick in 2016, to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Ryan Miller and Steve Ott.\nOn March 2, 2015, minutes before the 2015 NHL trade deadline, Stewart was traded to the Minnesota Wild in exchange for a second-round pick in 2017 NHL Draft.\nA deadline rental for the Wild, Stewart was released to free agency and on July 12, 2015, signed a one-year, $1.7 million deal with the Anaheim Ducks.\nReturn to Minnesota and Calgary Flames.\nOn July 1, 2016, Stewart signed a two-year, $2.3 million deal with the Minnesota Wild.\nDuring the 2017–18 season, having been placed on waivers by the Wild approaching the trade deadline, Stewart was claimed by the Calgary Flames on February 26, 2018. He appeared in 7 regular season games scoring 3 points as the Flames missed out on the post-season.\nLater career.\nAs a free agent from the Flames, Stewart was un-signed over the summer, before opting to continue his professional career in Europe agreeing to a one-year deal with Slovakian club, HC Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) on September 26, 2018. Stewart however never featured with Slovan, after he was initially reported missing by the club as a consequence of failing to attend the introductory press conference on October 3, 2018. He was later found and immediately announced his retirement from professional hockey citing family concerns.\nAfter returning to Canada, Stewart was later announced to have signed for the 2018–19 season with semi-professional outfit the Hamilton Steelhawks, to compete for the Allan Cup on October 18, 2018.\nOn January 3, 2019, Stewart ended his brief retirement and signed for the Nottingham Panthers of the EIHL following in the footsteps of his elder brother who played there during the NHL lock-out in 2012. In the 2018–19 season, Stewart added a physical presence up front to the Panthers, notching 13 points in 23 games.\nReturning to North America in the off-season as a free agent, on July 17, 2019, Stewart was signed by former Wild and current Philadelphia Flyers general manager Chuck Fletcher to a professional try-out contract to attend the Flyers 2019 training camp. He signed a one-year contract with the Flyers on October 15, 2019.\nOn June 8, 2020, Stewart became an inaugural executive board member the Hockey Diversity Alliance, whose goal is to address intolerance and racism in hockey. On September 27, 2020, Stewart announced his retirement after 13 professional seasons on Twitter. Remaining in hockey, Stewart continued within the Flyers organization remaining with the club as a player development coach.\nInternational play.\nStewart played with Canada at the 2011 IIHF World Championship held in Slovakia, where in seven games, he recorded two goals and four points.

        "title": "Milt Thompson (baseball)",
        "text": "Milton Bernard Thompson (born January 5, 1959), is an American former professional baseball outfielder, pinch hitter, and , who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, St. Louis Cardinals, Houston Astros, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Colorado Rockies. He returned as the Cincinnati Reds’ minor league hitting instructor, for the season. Over his MLB career, Thompson compiled a batting average of .274.\nMajor league career.\nThe Atlanta Braves drafted Thompson in the 2nd round (29th overall) of the 1979 draft, out of Howard University. He made his big league debut, five years later, in . After two years in Atlanta, as a part-time left fielder, the Braves traded Thompson, along with Steve Bedrosian, to the Phillies, for Ozzie Virgil and Pete Smith. Thompson continued to impress, batting .251, .302, and .288, respectively, in his three seasons in Philadelphia.\nOn December 16, 1988, Thompson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals, for Steve Lake and Curt Ford, where he spent four years and posted his highest batting average ever, .307, in . Following the season, Thompson was granted free agency and elected to return to the Phillies.\nAs a key component in the Phillies’ unexpected, last-to-first 1993 National League Championship team, Thompson platooned in left field with Pete Incaviglia, in the World Series, against the Toronto Blue Jays. He remained an ever-popular fan favorite, while having another stellar season.\nPerhaps Thompson's greatest MLB performance came on April 29, 1993. That day, the Phillies left fielder really \"brought his 'A' Game\" to the San Diego Padres’ Jack Murphy Stadium. He had already gone 3-for-4 at the plate (3 singles), with 2 runs batted in (RBI), and one run scored. Then, crowning his day — and quite possibly his big league career: With the game on the line and the Phillies ahead 5-3, in the bottom of the eighth inning and two out, the Padres had the bases loaded, bringing their slugging right-handed catcher, Bob Geren, to the plate. David West, the Phillies’ left-handed relief pitcher, delivered a choice fastball that took a long ride, sailing over from home plate, and above the wall in left-center field. The fleet-footed Thompson arrived just in time, planted his feet, and made a surreal leap – seemingly sensing in some sort of inexact prayer, where the ball was – and cradled it into his glove's web, retiring the side and preserving another Phillies win, in that magical 1993 season, high-fiving center fielder Lenny Dykstra all the way to the visiting dugout.\nOn July 31, 1994, Thompson was traded by Philadelphia, to the Houston Astros, for pitcher Tom Edens. Again, following the season, Thompson was granted free agency, after being with the Astros for only a short time. As a free agent, he elected to re-sign with Houston, for another year. After the season, Thompson was again a free agent, and signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers; on June 27, 1996, he was selected off waivers by the Colorado Rockies. His career with the Rockies lasted just over 5 weeks, as Thompson received his unconditional release on August 2, 1996, thus ending his big league playing career.\nCoaching.\nIn 1997, Thompson became the minor league outfield/base-running coordinator in the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization. In 1998, he joined the Phillies as a minor league coach. Thompson lasted there for two seasons, until taking 2000 off, then returned as a minor league base-running/outfield coordinator, again in the Phillies farm system.\nIn 2004, Thompson joined the major league Phillies staff as first base coach. The next year, he became the team's hitting coach, where he remained for five-plus seasons. During Thompson's tenure as batting coach, the Phillies have led the league twice in runs scored, even though they have alternated between only 2nd and 3rd place in their respective division due to pitching difficulties. He was one of the few coaches not fired by the organization in 2005. As the hitting coach of the 2008 World Champion Philadelphia Phillies, Thompson earned the first World Series ring of his long career in baseball. He would return to the World Series in 2009, where the Phillies lost to the New York Yankees, in six games.\nHaving played for the 1993 National League Champions, Thompson joined Larry Bowa and John Vukovich as the only Phillies in franchise history to go to the World Series as both a player and coach for the club.\nOn Thursday, July 22, 2010, Thompson was relieved of his duties as the Phillies’ hitting coach, being replaced by former Minor League hitting coach Greg Gross. Thompson was hired by the Astros that November, as their minor league outfield/base-running coordinator. He became a coach for the Kansas City Royals’ Class A affiliate, the Wilmington Blue Rocks, in . Thompson joined the Reds organization, as a minor league hitting instructor, in .\nPersonal life.\nThompson has four daughters. He resides in Washington Township, Gloucester County, New Jersey, with his family."

        "title": "2001 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2001 UEFA Champions League final was a football match that took place at San Siro in Milan, Italy, on 23 May 2001, to decide the winner of the 2000–01 UEFA Champions League. The match pitted German side Bayern Munich against Spanish side Valencia. The match finished in a 1–1 draw, but Bayern clinched their fourth title by winning 5–4 on penalties. This was also their first European Cup title in a quarter-century, also representing Valencia's second consecutive final defeat (2000 and 2001). As all the goals in the match were scored from penalties, with also Bayern Munich missing a penalty in normal time and a penalty shoot-out was required to decide the winner, this UEFA Champions League match became an \"all-penalty\" final. The 2001 final was a meeting of the two previous seasons' losing finalists – Bayern Munich lost to Manchester United in 1999 and Valencia lost to Real Madrid in 2000.\nThis was the sixth European Cup final to be decided on penalties, and the second under the Champions League format. This was Ottmar Hitzfeld's second Champions League title after he won it with Borussia Dortmund in 1997, making him the second coach in European Cup history, after Ernst Happel, to win the competition with two clubs. Meanwhile, it was Héctor Cúper's third consecutive European final defeat; he lost the 1999 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final with Mallorca, before losing the 2000 Champions League final with Valencia.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThis final would come to be known for the goalkeeping heroics of Bayern keeper Oliver Kahn.\nValencia opened the score early on with a Gaizka Mendieta penalty in the third minute after a prostrate Patrik Andersson was deemed to have handled the ball in the penalty area. Only a few minutes later, Bayern Munich were awarded a penalty after Jocelyn Angloma fouled Stefan Effenberg in the penalty box, but Santiago Cañizares saved Mehmet Scholl's kick with his legs. Bayern were awarded another penalty early in the second half, this time after Amedeo Carboni handled the ball while competing for a header with Carsten Jancker. This time, Stefan Effenberg took the penalty kick and sent Cañizares the wrong way to level the scores at 1–1. The scores remained level for the remainder of normal time and throughout the 30 minutes of extra time, so the match went to penalties.\nAgain, Valencia took the lead early on as Paulo Sérgio put the first kick of the shoot-out over the bar before Mendieta sent Oliver Kahn the wrong way. Hasan Salihamidžić, John Carew and Alexander Zickler then traded penalty goals before Kahn saved Zlatko Zahovič's kick to tie the scores at 2–2 after three kicks each. The next kick from Patrik Andersson was also saved by Cañizares, and then Kahn stretched out a hand to tip Amedeo Carboni's shot onto the crossbar. Both Rubén Baraja and Stefan Effenberg then scored to take the shoot-out to sudden death. Bixente Lizarazu and Kily González both scored their clubs' sixth kicks of the penalty shoot-out, and then Thomas Linke scored for Bayern to set Mauricio Pellegrino up for the game-deciding kick. Kahn guessed the right direction and saved Pellegrino's kick, winning the cup for Bayern Munich.\nKahn also won the UEFA Fair Play Award for consoling his heartbroken rival, Valencia's Santiago Cañizares after the penalty shoot-out."

        "title": "Rugby union in the Cook Islands",
        "text": "Rugby union in the Cook Islands is a popular sport. It is a tier three rugby playing nation. They began playing international rugby in 1971 and have yet to make the Rugby World Cup. They are currently rated 55th, with 2,258 registered players and 21 clubs.\nGoverning body.\nThe Cook Islands Rugby Union was founded in 1948, and affiliated to the IRFB in 1995. The Cook Islands Rugby Union are also members of the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance.\nHistory.\nAs with many Pacific Island nations, rugby has been the main sport since the early 20th century. Visiting ships from Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Japan, have kept the game going. However, Cook Island rugby has mostly taken the form of an informal folk sport until recently. In the 1990s, Anthony Turua played a major part in formalising the situation, and getting the national side up to standard. Although they did not manage to get into the Rugby World Cup, the Cook Islands have done well in a tough rugby region, and managed to beat Papua New Guinea. As with several of the Pacific Nations, the Cook Islands have tended to do best at rugby sevens.\nThe Cook Islands have suffered a problem common to many other surrounding nations such as Samoa; with potential players opting to play for bigger nations. Both brothers Graeme and Steve Bachop were eligible to play for the Cook Islands but chose to play for their country of birth New Zealand.\nNational team.\nThe Cook Islands national rugby union team began playing international rugby union in 1971. Thus far, the Cook Islands have not made an appearance at any of the Rugby World Cups. They are very far from the level of Fiji, Samoa and Tonga. They can also supply players for the Pacific Islanders team."

        "title": "2002 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2002 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2002 World Cup, the 17th edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at the International Stadium in Yokohama, Japan, on 30 June 2002, and was contested by Germany and Brazil. The tournament comprised hosts Japan and South Korea, holders France, and 29 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Germany finished first in Group E, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Paraguay in the round of 16, the United States in the quarter-finals and South Korea in the semi-finals. Brazil finished top of Group C with three wins, before defeating Belgium in the round of 16, England in the quarter-final, and Turkey in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 69,029 supporters, with an estimated 1.1 billion watching on television, and was refereed by Pierluigi Collina from Italy.\nAfter a goalless first half, Brazil took the lead through Ronaldo on 67 minutes, scoring after what German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn called his \"only mistake in the finals\". They extended their lead twelve minutes later when Kléberson ran towards the German penalty area before passing towards Rivaldo. He let the ball pass through his legs and it reached Ronaldo, who used his first touch to take the ball away from German player Gerald Asamoah, and then shot the ball into the bottom corner of Kahn's net. The final score was 2–0 to Brazil.\nBrazil's win was their fifth World Cup title, which remains a record . Ronaldo was named the man of the match, while Kahn was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. Brazil's manager, Luiz Felipe Scolari, expressed \"the joy of knowing we did our job\", while noting that it was \"full of very hard work\". His German counterpart Rudi Völler said, \"When you lose a game, the disappointment is great, of course. But it is no shame to lose against a team like Brazil.\" At the next World Cup in Germany in 2006, Brazil were eliminated in the quarter-final by France while Germany reached the semi-final stage on home soil and eventually finished third.\nBackground.\nThe 2002 FIFA World Cup was the 17th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held in Japan and South Korea between 31 May and 30 June 2002. The national teams of Japan and South Korea qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, as did France as the winners of the previous World Cup in 1998. The remaining 29 spots were decided through qualifying rounds held between March 2000 and November 2001, organised by the six FIFA confederations and involving 193 teams. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out stage. World Cup holders France were eliminated in the group stage in 2002, losing games against Senegal and Denmark as they finished bottom of Group A.\nThe game was played at the International Stadium in Yokohama, where three other matches in the World Cup were previously held. The stadium was the largest in the tournament as well as the largest in Japan, seating over 70,000 spectators. The aggregate attendance across all World Cup matches at the stadium was 260,000.\nThe match ball for this game was the Adidas Fevernova, which was specifically made for the World Cup. Its design was different from the normal \"Tango\" type of three-pointed shapes connecting each hexagon, instead introducing a different, triangle-like shape on four hexagons. This look and colour usage was based on Asian culture. It was manufactured using a syntactic foam layer and Adidas said should give the ball a \"more precise and predictable flight path\". Adidas said the ball was smaller and heavier than the average permitted circumference and weight, but several players criticised it for being too large and too light. Italian goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon called the ball \"a ridiculous kiddy's bouncing ball,\" while Brazil's Edílson criticised the ball as being \"too big and too light\".\nIn the previous World Cup in 1998, Germany had reached the quarter-final stage, in which they were eliminated by Croatia. The team suffered several injuries prior to the 2002 World Cup finals including a knee issue for Sebastian Deisler, who was ruled out two days before the team departed for the tournament with an injury sustained in a friendly match against Austria. Midfielder Mehmet Scholl and defenders Christian Wörns and Jens Nowotny also missed the tournament due to injury. Brazil had reached the final of the 1998 tournament, where they lost 3–0 to France. Between that defeat and 2002, Brazil went through a series of managers. The first was Vanderlei Luxemburgo, whose contract was terminated after the team lost another FIFA final at the Confederations Cup against another host of the tournament at the time Mexico in the final and were eliminated at the quarter-finals of the 2000 Olympic football tournament. He was followed by Émerson Leão, who was dismissed in 2001 after winning four of eleven games in charge and with Brazil at risk of not qualifying for the World Cup for the first time. The incumbent going into the tournament was Luiz Felipe Scolari, who favoured a different style of football from his predecessors which he called \"bullyboy soccer\". In describing the style, \"Soccer America\" Scott French said \"the object is to disrupt and destroy, foul and waste time\". The two teams had met previously in several friendlies as well as the 1980 World Champions' Gold Cup, the 1993 U.S. Cup and the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup – their most recent meeting, which resulted in a 4–0 Brazil win – but the 2002 final was their first meeting at a World Cup.\nRoute to the final.\nGermany.\nGermany were drawn in Group E at the World Cup, along with Cameroon, the Republic of Ireland and Saudi Arabia. In their opening match against Saudi Arabia at the Sapporo Dome in the Japanese city of Sapporo they won 8–0, their biggest win in a World Cup. Miroslav Klose scored a hat-trick and was one of six players on the German team to score. In their next game against the Republic of Ireland, Klose gave Germany a 1–0 lead which they held throughout much of the game. However, Ireland equalised through Robbie Keane in second-half stoppage time. This would prove to be the only goal conceded by Germany prior to the final. Needing a win to finish first in their group, Germany entered their final match against Cameroon at Shizuoka Stadium in Fukuroi, Japan, one point ahead of the Republic of Ireland in the group. Germany went on to beat Cameroon 2–0, with goals from Marco Bode and Klose – his fifth goal of the tournament – although Germany did suffer a setback when Carsten Ramelow was sent off. Germany finished top of Group E with seven points (two wins and a draw), and advanced to the knockout round.\nIn the round of 16, Germany faced Paraguay, the runner-up in Group B, at Jeju World Cup Stadium in the South Korean city of Seogwipo. The first half ended goalless and it remained so until the 88th minute when Oliver Neuville scored, securing a 1–0 win for Germany. In their quarter-final match, Germany faced the United States who had more shots on goal, but Germany won the game 1–0 with Michael Ballack scoring in the 38th minute. In the semi-final, Germany faced co-hosts South Korea at the Seoul World Cup Stadium. Like the game against Paraguay, there were no goals until late in the game, until Ballack scored the winner, hitting the rebound into the goal after goalkeeper Lee Woon-jae had saved his winner shot. Four minutes before scoring, he had been shown a yellow card for a foul on Lee Chun-soo and was suspended for the final for receiving his second booking.\nBrazil.\nBrazil were drawn into Group C, along with China, Costa Rica and Turkey. Their first game was on 3 June against Turkey. In stoppage time at the end of the first half, Turkey's Hasan Şaş scored. In the second half, Brazil's Ronaldo levelled the match at 1–1 in the 50th minute. Four minutes before the end of regular time, the referee awarded Brazil a penalty after Turkish defender Alpay Özalan fouled Brazilian striker Luizão, with Alpay also receiving a red card. Rivaldo scored from the penalty spot and the match finished 2–1 to Brazil. During the game, Turkish defender Hakan Ünsal kicked a ball towards Rivaldo which struck his thigh, but Rivaldo fell to the ground clutching his face. The referee sent the Turkish player off with a second yellow card. In their second game against China at the Ulsan Munsu Football Stadium in Ulsan, South Korea, Brazil won 4–0 with Roberto Carlos, Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo all scoring. In their final game against Costa Rica, Brazil completed a 5–2 win. Ronaldo scored two goals, with Edmílson, Rivaldo and Júnior scoring the others. Brazil finished in first place in their group with nine points and eleven goals.\nIn the round-of-16, Brazil faced Group H runners-up Belgium at the Kobe Wing Stadium in Kobe, Japan. The game remained goalless until he 67th minute, when Rivaldo scored for Brazil. Ronaldo added a second goal in the 87th minute, to complete a 2–0 win for Brazil. Brazil faced England in the quarter-finals, with their opponents taking the lead through a goal by Michael Owen in the 23rd minute. The scores were levelled in first half stoppage time, when Rivaldo scored. Following half-time, Ronaldinho scored for Brazil, putting them in the lead. Ronaldinho was sent off by referee Felipe Ramos Rizo seven minutes later, which meant he was suspended for the semi-final. Although they played with ten men, the Brazilians were able to prevent an equaliser from England and advanced into the semi-finals. There, Brazil faced Turkey for the second time, at the Saitama Stadium 2002 in Saitama, Japan. The game was goalless until the 49th minute, when Ronaldo scored what proved to be the only goal of the match, running in the penalty area and hitting it with his toe past goalkeeper Rüştü Reçber, as Brazil won 1–0.\nMatch.\nPre-match.\nWith the exception of the suspended Ballack, who was replaced by Jens Jeremies, the remainder of the team that started the semi-final against South Korea were available and selected for the final. For Brazil, Ronaldinho returned to the team following his suspension in the semi-final. He replaced Edílson, whom BBC Sport described as having been a \"poor replacement\" for Ronaldinho and \"almost anonymous throughout\". Brazil's team was otherwise unchanged from the team which beat Turkey.\nBrazil were considered the favourites to win the match by bookmakers, with odds of 2–5 compared with 7–4 for Germany. Previewing the match, BBC Sport said that \"both teams [had] had problematic passages to the final\" but noted the two teams' experience at this level, highlighting Brazil's record number of titles as well as Germany's status as the most successful European team. The report focused on Ronaldo, who it said was \"nearing redemption\" having been \"a shadow of his usual self after he played just a few hours after suffering a fit\" in the 1998 final. It also noted that the Germans could take solace in the performances of goalkeeper Oliver Kahn, who had conceded only one goal up to that point in the tournament.\nPierluigi Collina of Italy was selected to referee the final. He was described prior to the match by Stephen Wade of the Associated Press as being \"regarded as game's finest referee\", and he is regarded by many observers as the greatest of all time. Describing his preparation for the game, Collina said that he was \"very interested in the tactics\" of the two teams, so that he would be \"ready to read the game\". He described his selection as \"unbelievable\", saying that \"I try to keep my feet on the ground but it is very difficult\". The assistant referees for the game were Leif Lindberg of Sweden and England's Philip Sharp, while Hugh Dallas from Scotland was the fourth official.\nFirst half.\nBrazil kicked off the game at 8pm local time (11am UTC), in front of an attendance of 69,029 with an estimated global television audience of 1.1 billion. The weather at Haneda Airport, from the stadium, was recorded as cloudy at the time of kick-off, with a temperature of and 88% humidity. Germany were described by \"The Guardian\" Scott Murray as \"well on top\" in the first fifteen minutes, and they had an opportunity to score when Bernd Schneider ran with the ball past Gilberto Silva before crossing into the penalty area towards Klose, where it was cleared behind by Edmílson. However, it was Brazil who had what Murray described as the \"first real chance of the game\" on 18 minutes. Ronaldinho passed upfield to Ronaldo, who was one-on-one with Kahn. Ronaldo hit a shot with his left foot, but it went wide of the goal. Schneider passed to Bode in the Brazilian penalty area on 29 minutes, but Bode was unable to control the ball. On 30 minutes Ronaldinho made another pass through to Ronaldo, who found himself with only Kahn to beat for a second time. He was unable to put enough power on the shot under pressure from Thomas Linke, and Kahn saved.\nShortly before half-time, Torsten Frings sent a cross into the Brazilian penalty area from the right towards Klose, but it evaded all players and was retrieved by Neuville on the opposite side of the pitch. He passed the ball to Jeremies outside the penalty area, who attempted a curling shot from , but it went high and wide of the goal. Kléberson then had two chances to score, putting the first wide in the 42nd minute, and hitting the bar from long range two minutes later. Lúcio had an opportunity when he received the ball in the penalty area and turned with it at his feet, but his shot was blocked. Ronaldo then missed his third scoring chance, in stoppage time, when a Roberto Carlos pass reached him after evading all the German defenders. Kahn saved Ronaldo's shot with his outstretched foot.\nSecond half.\nOne minute into the second half, Jeremies had a chance to give Germany the lead when Neuville found him in an unmarked position from a corner kick, but his header was blocked by the foot of Edmílson. They had another opportunity in the 50th minute, when Neuville struck a free kick from long range towards the corner of the goal, but Brazilian goalkeeper Marcos tipped the shot onto the post. Three minutes later, Roberto Carlos crossed into the penalty area where Gilberto Silva met the ball with a header, but Kahn was able to make the save. Ronaldo then hit a shot at the German goal which was blocked by Ramelow, before Klose passed to Frings at the other end and he hit his attempt over the crossbar. A shot two minutes later from Dietmar Hamann also went over the goal. Then, in the 62nd minute, Schneider sent a ball into the Brazilian penalty area which Neuville was unable to reach.\nBrazil took the lead in the 67th minute with a sequence that started with Ronaldo winning the ball from Hamann in the German half of the pitch. He passed to Rivaldo, who struck a low shot towards goal. Kahn attempted to catch the shot, but he was unable to take it cleanly and it rebounded into play. Ronaldo, who had followed Rivaldo's shot, took advantage of Kahn being off balance, scoring the rebound into the bottom corner before Kahn could recover. The Brazilians scored their second goal twelve minutes later, after a run from Kléberson from just beyond the halfway line led to Brazil having four attackers against Germany's three defenders. Kléberson passed towards Rivaldo, who was in the centre of the pitch just outside the German penalty area. Rivaldo let the ball go through his legs, and the pace on Kléberson's pass found Ronaldo. German player Gerald Asamoah attempted to block the shot, but Ronaldo used his first touch to take the ball away from him, and struck the ball into the bottom corner of Kahn's net with his second. Germany had another chance in the 83rd minute when Oliver Bierhoff, who had come on as a substitute, hit a first-time shot towards goal from the penalty spot, but Marcos was able to save the shot. Christian Ziege had a final shot for Germany in the third minute of stoppage time, but it was saved by Marcos and the game finished 2–0 to Brazil.\nDetails.\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nThe win marked Brazil's fifth World Cup title, which remains the record, ahead of Germany and Italy with four titles each. Despite being at the match, the Japanese emperor Akihito did not join the ceremony of presenting the winners the World Cup trophy as it was against Japanese customs. FIFA president Sepp Blatter and former Brazilian World Cup winner Pelé gave the trophy to Brazilian captain Cafu on the pitch stage. Ronaldo was named as the official man of the match, while Kahn was awarded the Golden Ball for the best individual player of the tournament as a whole – the only goalkeeper to receive that award. He also received the Lev Yashin Award (known since 2010 as the Golden Glove) for best goalkeeper at the tournament. After the tournament, FIFA conducted a video review of the incident in the first Brazil–Turkey game involving Ünsal and Rivaldo and decided to fine the Brazilian 11,670 Swiss francs for deceiving the referee.\nScolari expressed his pleasure at the result after the match, as well as noting the happiness of the Brazilian population, saying they had \"the joy of knowing we did our job, but it was full of very hard work. Brazil back as world champions – that is not something we can forget.\" Ronaldo said \"The goals crowned my work and the work of the whole team. I worked for two years trying to recover from that injury and today God reserved this for me and the Brazilian team. I am very happy.\" Speaking about his role in Brazil's opening goal, Kahn said \"It was my only mistake in the finals. It was 10 times worse than any mistake I've ever made. There's no way I can make myself feel any better or make my mistake go away.\" Völler exonerated Kahn, however, saying \"He has played a dream World Cup. He has made sensational saves, which no one could have expected\". Regarding Germany's defeat, he said \"When you lose a game the disappointment is great of course. But it is no shame to lose against a team like Brazil.\"\nAt the next World Cup in 2006, Germany – the hosts of that tournament – reached the semi-final where they were eliminated by eventual-winners Italy. Brazil failed in the defence of their title, being eliminated in the quarter-final by France. The next World Cup meeting between the two sides took place at the semi-finals of the 2014 tournament, which was held in Brazil. In a game described by Simon Burnton of \"The Guardian\" as being \"of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament's history\", Germany won the game 7–1. They went on to win the 2014 World Cup, their sole tournament victory since the 2002 final while for Brazil, 2002 remains their most recent World Cup title as of 2024.\nOver 200 nations and territories broadcast the final over radio and television. In total, 232 television channels broadcast the match, which was a new record for a World Cup Final (only later to be broken in 2006). The final had the highest television audience of the entire tournament, attracting over 63 million viewers in Nielsen-measured countries. Germany's match against South Korea was a close second, as with much of the host nation viewing the game. It was the highest-viewed non-finals match in World Cup history."

        "text": "The 1998 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 1998 FIFA World Cup, the 16th edition of the quadrennial football competition organised by FIFA for the men's national teams of its member associations. The match was played at the Stade de France in Paris, France, on 12 July 1998, and was contested by Brazil and France. The tournament featured France as the hosts, Brazil as the winners of the previous World Cup and 30 other teams who emerged from the qualification tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Brazil finished first in Group A, with two wins and one defeat, after which they beat Chile in the round of 16, Denmark in the quarter-finals and the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-finals. France finished top of Group C with three wins, before defeating Paraguay in the round of 16, Italy in the quarter-final, and Croatia in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 75,000 supporters, with an estimated 1.3 billion watching on television, and was refereed by Said Belqola from Morocco.\nBefore the match, speculation surrounded the fitness of striker Ronaldo, who was initially left out of Brazil's starting line-up, only to be restored to the team before kick-off. France took the lead shortly before the half-hour mark, when Zinedine Zidane outjumped Leonardo to connect with a header from an in-swinging corner from the right taken by Emmanuel Petit. Zidane scored again, with another header from a corner, shortly before half-time to give France a 2–0 lead. Petit then added a third goal in second-half injury time, striking the ball low into the net following a pass by Patrick Vieira, to complete a 3–0 win for France.\nFrance's win was their first World Cup title, as they became the seventh different nation to win the tournament. Zidane was named the man of the match, while Ronaldo was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. Following the win, hundreds of thousands of French supporters celebrated in Paris throughout the night, before assembling along the Champs-Élysées the following day for an open-top bus tour by the French players. France followed up their victory by winning their next major tournament at UEFA Euro 2000. Ronaldo's fitness for the match and his initial omission and later reinstatement on Brazil's teamsheet became a subject of ongoing journalistic interest following the match, with analysis continuing more than 20 years later.\nBackground.\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the 16th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for men's national teams, held in France between 10 June and 12 July 1998. The finals featured 32 teams for the first time, up from 24 in the 1994 World Cup. Both France and Brazil qualified automatically for the tournament – France as hosts and Brazil because they had won the tournament in 1994. The remaining 30 spots were decided through qualifying rounds held between March 1996 and November 1997, organised by the six FIFA confederations and involving 168 teams. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out stage. The game was played at the Stade de France, in the northern Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, an 80,000-capacity stadium which was purpose-built for the 1998 FIFA World Cup because there were no previously existing venues large enough to accommodate the final.\nBrazil had won the previous World Cup in the United States in 1994, defeating Italy in a penalty shoot-out in the final after the match had finished 0–0 after extra time, the first ever goalless final. They began the 1998 tournament as favourites with Mário Zagallo, their manager, having been involved with all four previous Brazilian wins – as a player in 1958 and 1962, as manager in 1970 and assistant manager in 1994. France did not qualify for the 1994 tournament because they were eliminated in their qualifying group, finishing behind Sweden and Bulgaria. However, they had followed this up with a run to the semi-finals at UEFA Euro 1996, in which they were beaten in a penalty shoot-out by the Czech Republic. France's midfielder Zinedine Zidane had been tied for third place in the 1997 FIFA World Player of the Year contest and was labelled by former Brazilian forward Pelé as \"one of the players to watch\" at the 1998 World Cup. Before the tournament, Aimé Jacquet, the manager of France, told reporters that his team were \"here to win the World Cup, nothing less\". The two teams had met twice previously in the World Cup – in the semi-final of the 1958 tournament, which Brazil won 5–2, and the quarter-final in 1986 when France won in a penalty shoot-out after the game finished 1–1 after extra time. Their most recent meeting was in the 1997 Tournoi de France, in a game which finished 1–1.\nThe match ball used at the tournament was the Adidas Tricolore, which was specifically made for the World Cup. The tricolour flag and Gallic rooster, traditional symbols of France were used as inspiration for the design. More than 20 drafts had been proposed by the Adidas design team before the definitive version was approved.\nRoute to the final.\nBrazil.\nBrazil were in Group A at the World Cup, in which they were joined by Morocco, Norway and Scotland. Their first game was the tournament opener at the Stade de France, on 10 June against Scotland. Brazil took the lead after four minutes when César Sampaio received the ball in the penalty area from a corner taken by Bebeto, and headed the ball past Jim Leighton in the Scotland goal. Scotland equalised through a penalty scored by John Collins, after Kevin Gallacher had been fouled in the penalty area. Brazil took the lead again in the second half when a volley by Cafu was saved by Leighton but rebounded off Scotland's Tom Boyd for an own goal. Scotland appealed for a second penalty in the final minute, claiming that Dunga had handled the ball, but it was not given and Brazil won 2–1. Their second game was against Morocco, on 16 June at the Stade de la Beaujoire in Nantes. Ronaldo gave Brazil the lead with his first World Cup goal nine minutes into the game, with Rivaldo and Bebeto also scoring to give Brazil a 3–0 win. Brazil were already confirmed as winners of the group before their third game, against Norway, but Zagallo nonetheless picked most of his first-choice team, leaving out only Aldair, who had received a yellow card against Scotland and risked suspension should he receive another, and Sampaio, who was already suspended. Brazil took the lead through Bebeto on 77 minutes. Norway responded with two goals in the last ten minutes – Tore André Flo scoring the equaliser and then winning a penalty when he was fouled by Gonçalves. Kjetil Rekdal scored from the penalty spot to give Norway a 2–1 win.\nBrazil's opponents in the round of 16 were Chile; the match was played on 27 June at the Parc des Princes in Paris. Brazil took the lead on 11 minutes when a Dunga free kick was met by Sampaio, who was unmarked and headed the ball past goalkeeper Nelson Tapia. Sampaio doubled Brazil's lead on 27 minutes when he shot into the corner of the net following a long-range Roberto Carlos free kick. Ronaldo added a third from a penalty in first-half injury time, after he had been fouled by Tapia. Marcelo Salas pulled a goal back for Chile in the second half, but Ronaldo then scored again to seal a 4–1 Brazilian win. In the quarter-finals they played Denmark at the Stade de la Beaujoire on 3 July. Denmark scored the first goal two minutes into the game through Martin Jørgensen, with Bebeto equalising eight minutes later. Brazil then took the lead with a goal by Rivaldo on 27 minutes, completing a move involving Dunga and Ronaldo. Brian Laudrup levelled the scores five minutes into the second half, but Rivaldo scored again 30 minutes before the end to seal a 3–2 win for Brazil.\nBrazil's semi-final was against the Netherlands at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille. Ronaldo gave Brazil the lead shortly after half-time, but Patrick Kluivert equalised for the Netherlands three minutes before the end. The game went to extra time, with the golden goal rule in effect. There was no further scoring, however, and the game was settled by a penalty shoot-out. The two sides took their kicks alternately with Brazil kicking first and the first five penalties were all scored, giving Brazil a 3–2 lead. Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel then saved penalties from Phillip Cocu and Ronald de Boer with Dunga scoring again for Brazil, which meant Brazil won the shoot-out 4–2 and progressed to the final.\nFrance.\nFrance were drawn in Group C at the finals, alongside Denmark, Saudi Arabia and South Africa. They began their campaign on 12 June against World Cup debutants South Africa at the Stade Vélodrome. In a match which Richard Williams of \"The Guardian\" said they \"dominated throughout\", France won 3–0 with a goal in the first half from Christophe Dugarry, a 77th minute own goal by South Africa's Pierre Issa and a last-minute strike by Thierry Henry.\nTheir second game was against Saudi Arabia at the Stade de France on 18 June. Henry gave France the lead in the first half, scoring from a cross by Bixente Lizarazu, before France scored three goals in the final fifteen minutes through David Trezeguet, Henry again and Lizarazu to complete a 4–0 win. Both sides had a player sent off – Mohammed Al-Khilaiwi in the 18th minute for Saudi Arabia and Zidane for France on 70 minutes for a stamp on Fuad Anwar. Zidane was suspended for the next two games. With progression to the knockout stage assured, Jacquet made eight changes to his team for the final game against Denmark at the Stade Gerland in Lyon on 24 June. France took the lead on 13 minutes when Youri Djorkaeff converted a penalty after Jes Høgh fouled Trezeguet. Denmark then won a penalty shortly before half-time for a Vincent Candela foul on Jørgensen which was scored by Michael Laudrup. In the second half, Emmanuel Petit scored with a low shot into the corner of the Danish goal to seal a 2–1 victory and first place in the group.\nFrance's round-of-16 opponents were Paraguay, at the Stade Félix-Bollaert in Lens on 28 June. In a match labelled a \"real stinker\" by Williams, with France described as \"extraordinarily inept\", there were no goals during the 90 minutes of normal time and the first period of extra time. With six minutes remaining, France broke the deadlock, Laurent Blanc scoring the FIFA World Cup's first ever golden goal to seal a 1–0 win and a place in the quarter-finals. There, they met Italy, the losing finalists from 1994, at Stade de France on 3 July. There were no goals during normal time and no golden goal, so the game was decided by a penalty shoot-out. With France taking the first penalty, both sides scored their openers, before goalkeepers Gianluca Pagliuca and Fabien Barthez saved a penalty each, from Lizarazu and Demetrio Albertini respectively. The next five were all scored to leave France 4–3 ahead with one Italian penalty remaining. Luigi Di Biagio struck the crossbar with his kick and France advanced to the semi-finals with a 4–3 shoot-out win. They returned to the Stade de France on 8 July for a semi-final against Croatia. After a goalless first half, there were two goals in quick succession shortly after half-time as Davor Šuker gave Croatia the lead before Lilian Thuram equalised for France. Thuram then gave France the lead on 70 minutes and, despite Blanc being sent off five minutes later for violent conduct towards Slaven Bilić, France held on for a 2–1 win and a place in the final. Blanc's red card was the only one he received in his entire career, and meant that he was suspended for the final. Bilić's reaction implied that Blanc had struck him on the head in the incident, but video replays showed that the impact had been to his chest or chin, and the incident is often cited as one of the most controversial in the competition's history.\nPre-match.\nBrazil was considered the favourites by bookmakers before the match, with odds of 4–6 for them to win the tournament, compared with 6–5 for France.\nMatch officials.\nSaid Belqola of Morocco was selected to referee the final. An amateur referee who worked as a customs officer professionally, he had begun officiating in 1983 before being selected to referee international matches in 1993. Prior to the 1998 World Cup he had refereed two matches each at the 1996 and 1998 African Cup of Nations, including the final of the latter tournament, between South Africa and Egypt. At the 1998 World Cup he had refereed the Argentina vs Croatia and Germany vs United States group games. The assistant referees were Mark Warren of England and Achmat Salie of South Africa, while Saudi Arabia's Abdul Rahman Al-Zaid was the fourth official.\nTeam selection.\nIn what was later described by writers for BBC Sport as the \"great World Cup final mystery\", Ronaldo was omitted from the official teamsheet which Zagallo presented to FIFA at 7:48 p.m. local time (5:48 p.m. UTC), 72 minutes before kick off, with Edmundo named in his place. Reporters for the BBC and other media received the news shortly after 8 p.m. and had not expected this development, with John Motson describing scenes of \"absolute mayhem and chaos\" in the commentary box. At 8:18 p.m., however, Brazil submitted a modified teamsheet with Ronaldo's name reinstated. It was revealed several years later that Ronaldo had suffered a convulsive fit on the afternoon of the final, had lost consciousness and spent three hours in hospital, but decided shortly before the match began that he still wished to play.\nWith the exception of Cafu, who had been suspended for Brazil's semi-final match and returned in place of Zé Carlos, Brazil therefore named an unchanged side with Edmundo on the substitutes' bench. Blanc was suspended following his semi-final red card and his place in the French team was taken by Frank Leboeuf. Otherwise, France named an unchanged team.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nFrance kicked off the match at 9 p.m. local time, in front of an attendance of 75,000 and an estimated global television audience of 1.7 billion. The weather at Charles de Gaulle Airport, from the stadium, was recorded as fair at the time of kick-off, with a temperature of and 50% humidity. France had a chance to score in the opening minute, when the ball was passed upfield towards Stéphane Guivarc'h, who attempted a bicycle kick which went over the cross bar and landed on the top of the Brazilian net. Guivarc'h had another opportunity three minutes later, when he received a pass from Zidane on the edge of the penalty area and was one-on-one with Taffarel, but his shot under pressure from Júnior Baiano was stopped by the goalkeeper. On 5 minutes, Rivaldo hit a long cross to the far corner of the penalty area towards Leonardo, who could not reach it; the ball went out for a goal kick. France won a free kick a minute later when Cafu fouled Lizarazu, which Zidane curled into the penalty area. It reached Djorkaeff, who was unmarked; he attempted to score with a header, but it went high and wide of the goal. On 17 minutes, Djorkaeff hit a long-range shot from the right-hand side, but it went wide of the Brazilian goal. Five minutes later, Ronaldo received the ball near the touch-line and started running towards goal; from the left-hand edge of the penalty area he passed it to his right. Barthez almost tipped the ball into his own goal but was able to catch it before it crossed the line. Brazil won a corner on 23 minutes, which was taken by Leonardo into the penalty area. Sampaio directed a powerful header towards the goal, but it was aimed straight at Barthez who saved it.\nZidane gave France the lead just before the half-hour mark, outjumping Leonardo to connect with a header from an in-swinging corner from the right taken by Petit. Four minutes later, Ronaldo received the ball following a long pass from Dunga, but Barthez punched his shot clear. Ronaldo and Barthez collided with each other during the incident; both needed assistance from medics but were able to continue the game. Baiano received the first yellow card of the match on 33 minutes for a foul on Djorkaeff. French captain Didier Deschamps was then shown a yellow card four minutes later for a diving challenge on Rivaldo. On 41 minutes, Petit had a chance to score from when a pass forward by Christian Karembeu rebounded to him in space after hitting the back of Baiano's feet. Baiano recovered, however, to deflect the Frenchman's shot wide of the goalpost. Shortly before first-half injury time, Thuram sent the ball upfield from deep within his own half, which was missed by the Brazilian defenders and reached Guivarc'h, one-on-one with Taffarel. The goalkeeper blocked his shot behind for a corner, however. France won another corner a minute later, which was taken on the left by Djorkaeff into the penalty area, where Zidane once again headed the ball into the goal, through the legs of Roberto Carlos, to give France a 2–0 half-time lead.\nSecond half.\nThe second half began with a Brazil substitution as Denílson replaced Leonardo. Marcel Desailly received a yellow card in the 49th minute for dissent, after the referee had penalised him for a foul on Cafu. On 51 minutes, Bebeto took a corner from the right-hand side which reached Denílson, who fell down as his attempted shot went wide of the goal while Deschamps was also challenging for the ball. Brazil's players appealed for a penalty, but Belqola did not award it. A minute later, Dunga had a shot from outside the penalty area which went wide of Barthez's goal. Karembeu was shown a yellow card on 55 minutes for a foul from behind on Cafu. Rivaldo took the resulting free-kick short towards Roberto Carlos, who ran to the left edge of the penalty area before crossing it in, where it reached Ronaldo. He shot from close range but Barthez saved. On 57 minutes, France made a change when Alain Boghossian came on in place of Karembeu. Three minutes later, Roberto Carlos took a long throw-in from the left-hand side, which Barthez failed to catch near the edge of his penalty area, allowing Bebeto to take a shot, but Desailly blocked it.\nOn 63 minutes, Guivarc'h was one-on-one with Taffarel following what FIFA commentators described as a \"mistake\" by the Brazilian defence, but he fired his shot wide of the goal. Three minutes later Guivarc'h was taken off, as Jacquet brought on Dugarry in his place. On 68 minutes, Desailly made a sliding tackle on Cafu which was given as a foul by the referee. Belqola showed him a second yellow card, which meant he was sent off and France had to play the last 20 minutes with only 10 men. After 74 minutes, Edmundo was brought on by Zagallo, replacing César Sampaio. A minute later, France made a defensive substitution, bringing on Patrick Vieira in place of Djorkaeff. On 82 minutes, Dugarry was through on goal with only Taffarel to beat, but his shot went wide of the goal. Brazil had a chance to score in second-half injury time when Denílson's shot hit the crossbar. Two minutes later, France created a final chance on the counterattack when Dugarry cleared Denílson's corner kick and found Vieira open on the left. Vieira then put his Arsenal teammate Petit through on goal with a first-touch through ball, and Petit finished low to Taffarel's left. Petit's goal was the 1000th in French national team history and was the final kick of the game, sealing a 3–0 victory.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Final\" /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nFrance's win was their first World Cup title, becoming the seventh out of – – eight different countries to win the tournament. They also became the sixth team to win the competition as hosts and the first since Argentina in 1978. It was only the second time Brazil had lost a World Cup final, with the first being their 2–1 upset loss to Uruguay at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro in the final match of 1950 known as the \"Maracanaço\" (similarly, this marked Brazil's first World Cup final loss in a knockout format). The 3–0 scoreline was also Brazil's largest loss in the World Cup until their 7–1 defeat to Germany in the 2014 World Cup semi-final at the Mineirão in Belo Horizonte.\nFrench president Jacques Chirac, the International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio Samaranch, the newly-elected FIFA president Sepp Blatter and his outgoing predecessor João Havelange, UEFA president Lennart Johansson, and co-president of local organizing committee Michel Platini were among those present at the stands during the awards ceremony. President Chirac handed the trophy to French captain Deschamps. \nMillions of French supporters celebrated their team's victory in Paris throughout the night, with an estimated 1.5 million on the Champs-Élysées alone as players' names and faces along with celebratory messages were projected onto the Arc de Triomphe. It was reported that such scenes had not been seen there since Paris' liberation from Nazi German occupation in late August 1944 during World War II, including Charles de Gaulle's parade down the same avenue on 26 August. \nThe next day, the Champs-Elysées was also packed with fans as the French players made an open-top bus tour down the avenue. The celebrations continued through to Tuesday, France's national Bastille Day holiday, with Chirac inviting the team to a garden party at the Élysée Palace following the Bastille Day military parade and praising the nation's solidarity during a speech there. The day after the final, \"L'Équipe\" led its front page with the banner headline \"Pour L'Éternité\" (For Eternity), with that 13 July edition becoming and remaining the most-sold edition in the newspaper's history with over 1.6 million copies sold.\nRonaldo's fitness for the match and his initial omission and later reinstatement on Brazil's teamsheet became a subject of ongoing journalistic interest following the match, with analysis continuing more than 20 years later. A number of conspiracy theories regarding the incident emerged, including an allegation by striker Edmundo (who had been set to play in Ronaldo's place) that Brazil's team sponsor Nike had pressured Zagallo to reinstate the player. Zagallo also said that the decision was his and the player's, saying \"if there had been interference, I would have resigned\". A government inquiry into Nike's involvement with Brazil was launched by politician Aldo Rebelo and interviewed numerous players, officials and team doctors, but it cleared Nike of any wrongdoing. Another theory, promulgated in Brazilian newspaper \"Folha de S.Paulo\", was that Ronaldo had a nervous breakdown during the tournament, and some players also said that team doctor Lidio Toledo had cried about Ronaldo's condition when he encountered him in the dressing room. Toledo did not sign him off as unfit however, later saying \"imagine if I stopped him playing and Brazil lost, at that moment I'd have to go and live on the North Pole.\"\nFrance followed up their victory by qualifying for and winning the UEFA Euro 2000 held in the Netherlands and Belgium. Brazil took the Copa América title in 1999, and then won the next World Cup in Japan and South Korea in 2002. France were eliminated in the group stage at the 2002 tournament, becoming the first World Cup holders to be eliminated without reaching the knockout stage since Brazil in 1966. They returned to the final in 2006, losing to Italy and being eliminated at the group stage again in 2010, before winning their second World Cup in 2018 with Deschamps as coach."

        "title": "1994 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1994 FIFA World Cup final was a soccer game that took place at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, United States, on July 17, 1994, to determine the winner of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Brazil beat Italy 3–2 on penalties to claim their fourth World Cup title when the game finished 0–0 after extra time; this was the first new FIFA World Cup Trophy for Brazil, as their previous three trophies were secured as Jules Rimet Trophy.\nIt was the first, and to date, only World Cup final to be scoreless both in regular and extra time and to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. Silver Ball winner Roberto Baggio missed the decisive penalty for Italy. Brazil had previously beaten Italy in the 1970 final, marking the 1994 final as the second time that the same teams had met in two different World Cup finals, after Argentina and Germany met in 1986 and 1990. Played at 12:30 pm local time, this was the most recent World Cup final to be played in a broad daylight.\nFIFA awarded the final game of the tournament to the famous college sports stadium near Los Angeles on June 30, 1992; the Rose Bowl was the largest stadium used for the tournament. With over 94,000 spectators, the 1994 Final is the most recent World Cup Final to have an attendance of 90,000 or more as of 2022.\nThe Brazilian team dedicated their win to the late triple Formula One motor racing world champion Ayrton Senna, who had died in an accident at that year's San Marino Grand Prix in Italy two and a half months before. With Italy finishing as runners-up, Franco Baresi became the sixth player in history to win gold, silver and bronze medals at the FIFA World Cup. Previously this result was attained in 1974 by five German players: Sepp Maier, Franz Beckenbauer, Wolfgang Overath, Jürgen Grabowski and Horst-Dieter Höttges.\nBackground.\nThe 1994 FIFA World Cup was the 15th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's competition for national teams, held in the United States between June 17 and July 17, 1994. The finals featured 24 teams, with the United States qualifying for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, along with Germany as the 1990 winners. The remaining 22 spots were decided through qualifying rounds held between March 1992 and November 1993, organized by the six FIFA confederations and involving 147 teams. In the final tournament, the twenty-four teams were divided into six groups of four with each team playing each other once within the group in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group along with the four best third-placed sides advanced to a knock-out phase.\nThe game was played at the Rose Bowl, in the city of Pasadena, California, part of the Los Angeles metropolitan area. With a capacity of 102,000, it was the largest of the venues selected for the World Cup and had previously hosted the gold medal match at the 1984 Summer Olympics and five Super Bowls, as well as the annual Rose Bowl Game in college American football. The ball for this game was the Adidas Questra, which was introduced at the start of the World Cup. The ball was lighter than those previously used. Canadian journalist Scott McKeen described it as having been \"engineered to created more excitement for soccer, in a land where there has been little soccer excitement\". The ball's controllability was praised by strikers in the tournament, but goalkeepers criticized what they said was its unpredictable tendency to deviate in flight.\nBrazil had won the title three times before, in 1958, 1962 and 1970, while Italy had also recorded three wins in the 1934, 1938 and 1982 tournaments. The winner would therefore be the first nation to record a fourth World Cup win. The two teams had met four times previously in the World Cup with two wins each – in the semi-final of the 1938 tournament, which Italy won 2–1; the 1970 final, which Brazil won 4–1; the third-place playoff in 1978, won 2–1 by Brazil, and four years later in the group stage, where Italy won the game 3–2.\nBrazil began the tournament as favorites, with both pundits and bookmakers regarding them as the most likely team to win. Commentators cited the team's star players such as Raí and Romario, as well as the hot weather conditions, which they said would favor Latin American teams. Italy was also listed before the tournament among the teams likely to win the competition, although some commentators thought they might face difficulties based on poor recent performance and a failure to adapt to manager Arrigo Sacchi's preferred attacking style of play. In the 1990 World Cup, Brazil had been eliminated in the round of 16, losing to Argentina, while Italy finished third in the tournament, on home soil, beating England in the third-place playoff game after losing to Argentina in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final.\nRoute to the final.\nBrazil.\nBrazil was in Group B at the World Cup, in which they were joined by Cameroon, Russia and Sweden. Their first game was the tournament opener at Stanford Stadium in California, on June 20 against Russia. Brazil opened the scoring on 26 minutes, when Romário evaded his marker following an in-swinging corner and hit the ball into the goal. Brazil scored again on 52 minutes, when Raí converted a penalty following a foul by Vladislav Ternavsky on Romário, and they went on to complete a 2–0 win. Their second game was against Cameroon on June 24, once again at Stanford. Romário gave Brazil the lead on 39 minutes after receiving a pass from Dunga and hitting it past goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell. In the second half, Cameroon defender Rigobert Song was sent off for a foul on Raí, before Márcio Santos and Bebeto added two further goals to complete a 3–0 win for Brazil. The result meant that Brazil had qualified for the round-of-16 with one game to spare. Brazil's final group game was against Sweden at the Pontiac Silverdome in Michigan on June 28. Kennet Andersson gave Sweden the lead on 23 minutes, following a long pass by Tomas Brolin, before Romário equalized for Brazil with his third goal of the tournament shortly after half time. The game finished 1–1, which was sufficient for Brazil to finish as group winners.\nBrazil faced the United States in the round of 16, playing the hosts on July 4, their Independence Day. Brazil's performance through most of the game was described by \"The Guardian\" Paul Wilson as \"wholly unconvincing as aspiring champions\", until Bebeto scored the game's only goal on 72 minutes. Both teams finished the game with 10 players after Brazil's Leonardo was dismissed for a violent foul while American Fernando Clavijo was sent off for a second bookable offense. In the quarter-finals, Brazil played the Netherlands at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas on July 9. After a goalless first half, Romário gave Brazil the lead from a Bebeto pass on 53 minutes, before Bebeto himself scored a second ten minutes later. The Dutch players disputed the second goal, saying that Romário had been caught by their offside trap when Branco passed forward to him in the build-up, but the goal stood. Rob Witschge of the Netherlands later said that the linesman was \"absolutely blind\". The Netherlands pulled a goal back a minute later through Dennis Bergkamp, and then equalized with 14 minutes remaining, through Aron Winter. Brazil scored again on 81 minutes when Branco hit a free-kick from to seal a 3–2 win. Brazil's semi-final was against the Sweden at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California on July 13. Sweden defended deeply throughout the game and was reduced to 10 players when Jonas Thern was sent off in the 63rd minute for a foul on Dunga. Brazil had much of the possession and several chances throughout the game, but they did not score until the 81st minute when Romário headed the ball into the Swedish goal from a Jorginho cross. Brazil won 1–0 and earned a place in the final.\nItaly.\nItaly was drawn in Group E at the finals, alongside Mexico, Norway and the Republic of Ireland. They began their campaign on June 18 against the Republic of Ireland at the Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Italy was one of the pre-tournament favorites to win the World Cup, but the crowd was predominantly Irish, many of them Irish Americans. Ireland won the game 1–0 through an 11th-minute goal by Ray Houghton, a result later described by \"The Irish Post\" as \"one of Ireland's greatest ever sporting moments\". Italy's second game was against Norway on June 23, once again the Giants Stadium. Goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off after 22 minutes for a professional foul, but Italy recovered to win the game 1–0, Dino Baggio scoring the winner after 69 minutes. Their final group game, against Mexico at the RFK Stadium in Washington, D.C., began with all four Group E teams level on points. The Italian supporters were again outnumbered by the opposition, but their team took the lead shortly after half-time through a low shot by Daniele Massaro. Massaro almost added a second on 56 minutes, but then Mexico equalized a minute later through Marcelino Bernal. The game finished 1–1, while Norway and the Republic of Ireland also drew, leaving all four teams on 4 points with identical goal difference. With the most goals scored, Mexico was 1st in the group, while Norway was bottom with fewest goals. Italy and the Republic of Ireland both had two goals each, but Ireland took second place through their win over Italy. Italy qualified for the next round, however, as one of the better-performing third-place teams, with their progress confirmed when Cameroon was defeated by Russia later that day.\nItaly's round-of-16 opponent was Nigeria, at the Foxboro Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, on July 5. Nigeria took the lead on 25 minutes, when Finidi George took a corner which bounced off Italian defender Paolo Maldini before being struck into the goal by Emmanuel Amunike. On 75 minutes, Italy's Gianfranco Zola, who had come on as a substitute, was sent off for a foul on Augustine Eguavoen, immediately after he had been denied a penalty. Despite this setback, Italy equalized on 88 minutes when Roberto Baggio hit a low shot past the Nigerian goalkeeper. With the score at 1–1, the game went to extra time and the game was decided when Roberto Baggio scored his second goal on 102 minutes, sealing a 2–1 Italian win. Their quarter-final game was against Spain in Foxborough on July 9. Dino Baggio gave Italy the lead on 25 minutes, before Spain's José Luis Caminero equalized shortly before the hour mark. For the second game in a row, Roberto Baggio scored on 88 minutes, scoring from a tight angle following a run into the penalty area and Italy won 2–1. They returned to the Giants Stadium on July 13 for a semi-final against Bulgaria. Bulgaria had defeated previous champions Argentina and Germany en route to the match, but Italy started strongly, Roberto Baggio scoring twice in the first half hour to give them a 2–0 lead. Bulgaria's Hristo Stoichkov pulled a goal back through a penalty shortly before half time, and protested about two denied penalty claims in the second half, but Italy held on for a 2–1 win and place in the grand final.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nBrazil's Mazinho was booked in the fourth minute for a foul on Nicola Berti. In the 13th minute, Romario had a chance to score with a header from close range, following a cross by Dunga, but his header went straight to the goalkeeper. Four minutes later, Romario passed the ball through to Bebeto on the left side of the penalty area. Instead of shooting, Bebeto attempted a cross but it deflected behind off Paolo Maldini. Italy then had one of their best chances of the game when Daniele Massaro beat two defenders and was one-on-one with Taffarel, but his shot was directed straight at the Brazilian goalkeeper. On 21 minutes, Brazil's Jorginho had to be leave the game following an injury sustained a few minutes previously and was replaced by Cafu. Italy made a replacement on 34 minutes, bringing Luigi Apolloni on for Roberto Mussi, moving Maldini to the left-back position. Roberto Baggio attempted a pass through to Antonio Benarrivo late in the first half but Aldair was able to intercept it. Late in the half, Brazil had two further opportunities, first from Romario, whose shot was parried by Gianluca Pagliuca without falling to a Brazilian player, and then through Branco whose free kick was saved. The free kick resulted from a foul by Apolloni on Romario, for which Apolloni received yellow card, while Italian defender Demetrio Albertini was also booked for not being sufficiently far from the ball during the free kick. The first half concluded with the score at 0–0.\nIn the second half, Cafu hit a shot that went across the face of the Italian goal, after which Bebeto attempted to score with a header which was saved by Pagliuca and was also flagged for offside. Roberto Baggio had a chance for Italy, when he received a pass from Dino Baggio and was able to run at the Brazilian goal, but Marcio Santos tackled him and kicked the ball out, ending his run. Silva attended a top-spin shot from distance which bounced off the goalpost, after which Mazinho also had a chance but Pagliuca was able to stop the ball. Other than that, the second half was largely devoid of scoring chances, as Brazil was unable to break through the center-back pairing of Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini. The lack of attacking play in the game was down to strong holding midfield play by Dino Baggio for Italy, and by both Dunga and Mauro Silva for Brazil.\nAs extra time began, chances would become more plentiful, as Brazil began to dominate play. Romário had another chance early in extra time after Pagliuca made an ill-advised decision to come for a cross, leaving the goal exposed, but Bebeto was unable to find him. Roberto Baggio, who had been quiet for most of the game having picked up an injury earlier in the tournament, had his only sight of goal in the entire game in the first half of extra time, hitting a shot from around 25 yards, but Taffarel pushed the shot over. Zinho had a chance on the stroke of halftime in extra time, hitting his shot well from inside the area, but Pagliuca saved well at his near post. In the second half of extra time, Romário missed a golden chance to hand Brazil the trophy, as Cafu had found him inside the six yard box. With Pagliuca at least four yards away from him on the other side of the goal, and the entire goal to aim at, the off balance Romário put his shot wide of the post.\nThis was the first time the World Cup would be decided on penalties. Italian captain Baresi took the first penalty and blazed his penalty over the bar. Brazilian center-back Márcio Santos went next, but Pagliuca saved the Brazilian defender's effort low to his right. Demetrio Albertini went next for Italy, scoring his penalty into the top corner. Romário was next for Brazil, and he scored his penalty, placing it so far in the corner that it went in off the post, tying the score at 1–1. Alberico Evani went third for Italy, he scored, putting his penalty high and in the middle, as Taffarel dove to the right. Branco went next for Brazil, and he scored in the bottom left corner. Massaro, who had scored twice in the Champions League Final less than two months previously, went next for Italy, but he was unable to put the ball in Taffarel's net just as he had been unable to do in the game, as the Brazilian keeper saved to his left. Brazilian captain Dunga was next, and he comfortably placed his shot into the bottom left corner, making it game point. With Italy needing to score to keep their dreams alive, talisman Roberto Baggio stepped up to take the penalty. In what would become an infamous moment in World Cup History, Baggio blazed his penalty over the bar, in similar fashion to Baresi, and this gave Brazil their fourth title.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nGame rules\nPost-match.\nU.S. Vice President Al Gore, UEFA president Lennart Johansson and FIFA president João Havelange were among those present at the stands during the awards ceremony.

        "title": "1990 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 1990 FIFA World Cup final was a football match played between West Germany and Argentina to determine the winner of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. The game took place on 8 July 1990 at the Stadio Olimpico in Italy's capital and largest city, Rome, and was won 1–0 by West Germany, with a late penalty kick taken by Andreas Brehme being the game's only goal.\nThe match marked several firsts in World Cup history. This was the first rematch of a final and, to date, the only back-to-back rematch, as Argentina defeated West Germany in the previous final. Argentina became both the first team to fail to score in a World Cup final, and the first defending champion to reach the final and lose. West Germany's victory over Argentina marked the first time a UEFA side defeated a CONMEBOL side in a final (all previous finals between the two continents were won by South Americans).\nWest Germany became the first team to play in three consecutive finals (they played in the 1982 and 1986 finals), a feat only repeated by Brazil in 1994, 1998, and 2002. It was West Germany's last World Cup match; the team played three more games before a unified German team was formed later in 1990, as a result of the reunification of the country after more than 40 years.\nMatch.\nNotable spectators.\nItalian president Francesco Cossiga, FIFA president João Havelange, FIFA secretary general Sepp Blatter, West German president Richard von Weizsäcker and chancellor Helmut Kohl, as well as the International Olympic Committee (IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch, IOC member Fahad Al-Sabah, and UEFA honorary president Jacques Georges, were among those attended the final. President Cossiga later handed the FIFA World Cup Trophy to West German captain Lothar Matthäus.\nSummary.\nThe 1990 final is often cited as one of the most cynical and ugliest World Cup finals. It was an ill-tempered game, notable for the first two sendings off in a World Cup final. Ian Morrison wrote \"the game did little for football but there was one consolation: Had the Argentines lifted the World Cup – with two wins and five goals in their seven matches – it would have been a catastrophe for the game. At least their awful approach to Italia '90 had gone unrewarded.\"\nThe West Germany team attacked relentlessly from the beginning of the match. In the 3rd minute, Rudi Völler, who had been forced off with a leg injury in the semi-final against England, had the first clear-cut opportunity to score from close range following a free-kick cross by Andreas Brehme, but his off-balance toe punt went off target. West Germany won another free kick in a more dangerous position two minutes later when Pierre Littbarski was fouled in the penalty arc. Brehme's shot hit the wall and Klaus Augenthaler's follow-up long-range strike was saved by Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea. In the 8th and 12th minutes, Völler's header and Littbarski's curl shot went high and wide of the goal, respectively. In the 13th minute, Völler failed to receive Brehme's outswinging cross, and the ball supposedly struck the arm of the Argentina defender Oscar Ruggeri. The Mexican referee Edgardo Codesal refused to award a penalty kick despite Jürgen Klinsmann's appealing for handball. Five minutes later, Völler appeared to be taken down in the Argentine penalty area, but Codesal indicated to play on. In the 23rd minute, West German captain Lothar Matthäus's cross found Völler and his header was again wide of the target. In the 38th minute, Argentina gained a dangerous free kick when José Basualdo was fouled by Guido Buchwald. Argentina's captain Diego Maradona's kick went up and over the wall but couldn't dip back to be on target. At half-time, the score was still level at 0-0.\nThe West Germans had a few chances at the start of the second half. Littbarski cut inside, dribbling past three South American defenders, but his shot from outside the box went just wide. Later, Thomas Berthold and Rudi Völler, respectively, failed to capitalize from dangerous free kicks taken by Andreas Brehme. In the 58th minute, Argentine goalkeeper Sergio Goycochea appeared to take down Klaus Augenthaler inside the penalty area, but the referee Edgardo Codesal again refused to award a penalty kick. Pedro Monzón had the distinction of being the first player to be sent off at a FIFA World Cup final, after being shown a straight red card for a reckless studs up challenge on Jürgen Klinsmann; FIFA had warned its officials to enforce the rules and Monzón had raised his foot during the tackle, a foul that Klinsmann claims left a gash on his shin. In the 78th minute, after an incorrectly given corner kick, West German captain Matthäus lost the ball inside his own penalty area and then appeared to trip Gabriel Calderón. Codesal once again said to play on, amid penalty shouts from the Argentinian midfielder.\nSix minutes from full time, Codesal incurred the wrath of the Argentinians after awarding West Germany a questionable penalty kick for Roberto Sensini's sliding tackle on Völler. Regular penalty taker Matthäus had been forced to replace his boots during the match and did not feel comfortable in the new ones, so Andreas Brehme took his place and converted the spot kick with a low, right-footed shot to the goalkeeper's right.\nGustavo Dezotti, already cautioned in the first half, received a straight red card late in the match when he hauled down Jürgen Kohler with what \"The New York Times\" described as a \"neck tackle right out of professional wrestling\", after Kohler refused to give-up the ball in an alleged attempt to waste time. After dismissing Dezotti, Codesal was surrounded and jostled by the rest of the Argentinian team, with Maradona receiving a yellow card for dissent. At the final whistle, Maradona, who was man marked by Guido Buchwald for almost the entire match, burst into tears and blamed the referee for the loss. Argentina entered the game with four players suspended and ended it with nine men on the field, overall losing over half their squad due to injury or suspension.\nIn total, West Germany had 16 scoring chances out of 23 shots. German head coach Franz Beckenbauer said \"There were no doubts whatsoever who was going to win. For 90 minutes we attacked Argentina and there was no feeling of any danger that a goal would be scored against us. As I saw it, we outplayed them from beginning to end.\" Beckenbauer said that the penalty \"was not the key to the game because in any case we would have scored, even if it had taken overtime... 1–0 by a penalty doesn't give a fair idea of this game. We could have won, 3–0. I don't remember a single chance Argentina had to score a goal.\"\nArgentina became the competition's first finalist not to score, with only one shot on goal. The South Americans failed to put together a coherent attacking strategy and lost the ball frequently. Instead, they focused on defending at all costs, knowing they would have the advantage if they managed to reach the penalty shoot-out, as they had already advanced twice in the tournament by this means. At the time, the 1990 final was the lowest-scoring final in the history of the competition—although this record was broken four years later, when Brazil beat Italy on penalties after 120 goalless minutes.\nThe 1990 victory gave West Germany their third FIFA World Cup title, also making them the team to have played in the most FIFA World Cup finals at the time (three wins, three defeats), as well as avenging their defeat at the hands of Argentina in the previous final. It also meant that Germany coach Franz Beckenbauer became the only person to have won both silver and gold medals at the World Cup as a player (1966, 1974) and as a coach (1986, 1990), and he also won a bronze medal as a player (1970). Having won on penalties against England in the semi-finals, West Germany became the first team to have won by that method en route to the title. This was repeated by Brazil (1994), France (1998), Italy (2006), and Argentina (twice in 2022, including the final).\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:"

A hit batsman is awarded first base, provided that (in the plate umpire's judgment) he made an honest effort to avoid the pitch, although failure to do so is rarely called by an umpire. Being hit by a pitch is often caused by a batter standing too close to, or \"crowding\", home plate.\nThis is a list of the top 100 Major League Baseball pitchers who have the most hit batsmen of all time.\nGus Weyhing (277) holds the dubious record for most hit batsmen in a career.

Stages 3, 10 and 22 were all two-part stages with the first half being a regular stage and the second half being a team or individual time trial. It was the only Tour de France to include a mid-stage climb to the Alpe d'Huez ski resort. The race was eventually won by Jacques Anquetil following an epic shoulder-to-shoulder battle with Raymond Poulidor during stage 20.\nTeams.\nThe 1964 Tour started with 132 cyclists, divided into 12 teams of 11 cyclists.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe main favourite was defending champion Jacques Anquetil. He had won the 1964 Giro d'Italia earlier that year, and was trying to win a Tour-Giro double, which at that moment had only been done by Fausto Coppi.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1964 Tour de France started on 22 June, and had one rest day in Andorra. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the Cime de la Bonette loop road on stage 9.\nRace overview.\nAnquetil, who was looking for his fifth Tour victory, was superior in the time trials, of which he won all three. But Raymond Poulidor dominated in the mountains, and Anquetil was close to losing.\nThe ninth stage finished in Monaco, where the riders would ride one extra lap, crossing the finish line twice. When the first group, including Poulidor and Anquetil, reached the finish line for the first time, Poulidor had forgotten the extra lap, and sprinted in avail for the victory. When the group reached the finish line for the second time, Anquetil won the sprint, and one minute of bonification time.\nIn the second part of the tenth stage, the time trial, Anquetil won. Poulidor finished in second place, losing 36 seconds, with a flat tire costing him some time.\nIn the rest day between the thirteenth and the fourteenth stage, Anquetil had joined a lamb barbecue, and in the fourteenth stage he was immediately dropped. His team director gave him a bottle of champagne, which washed away the indigestion, and then Anquetil was able to get back to Poulidor. Poulidor then broke a spoke, the repair cost him some time, even more because a team mechanic, trying to help him gain speed, made him fall.\nPoulidor attacked in the fifteenth stage, and stayed away. He won the stage, and in the general classification climbed to third place, nine seconds behind second-placed Anquetil.\nAnquetil won the time trial of stage 17, and became the leader; Poulidor was in second place, only 56 seconds behind. In the twentieth stage, Poulidor did not have the right bicycle for the climb, but did not tell it to his team director. Poulidor dropped Anquetil in the climb, but the margin was not big enough for him to take over the lead, and Anquetil remained leader of the race by 14 seconds.\nIn the final time trial, Anquetil was the favourite, being the specialist. Poulidor rode as fast as he could, and with all other cyclists but Anquetil finished, had the best time. Anquetil was the last rider to ride the time trial, and was five seconds slower at the intermediate time check, which gave Poulidor hope that he could emerge as winner. However, Anquetil was clearly faster in the second part, and won the time trial. Anquetil won the Tour by only 55 seconds, which was at that moment the smallest margin in history.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1964 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after certain stages to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Henry Anglade won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass a point by his final residence, the \"Villa Mia\" in Beauvallon, Grimaud, on the French Riviera on stage 10a. This prize was won by André Darrigade."

        "title": "1963 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1963 Tour de France was the 50th instance of that Grand Tour. It took place between 23 June and 14 July, with 21 stages covering a distance of . Stages 2 and 6 were both two part stages, the first half being a regular stage and the second half being a team or individual time trial.\nThe Tour organisers were trying to break the dominance of Anquetil, who had won already three Tours, by reducing the time trials length to only , so that the climbing capabilities would be more important.\nNonetheless, the race was won by Anquetil, who was able to stay close to his main rival Federico Bahamontes in the mountains, one time even by faking a mechanical problem in order to get a bicycle that was more suited for the terrain. Bahamontes finished as the second-placed cyclist, but won the mountains classification. The points classification was won by Rik Van Looy.\nTeams.\nThe 1963 Tour started with 130 cyclists, divided into 13 teams. The IBAC–Molteni team was a combination of five cyclists from and five from , each wearing their own sponsor's jerseys.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe main favourite before the race was Jacques Anquetil, at that moment already a three-time winner of the Tour, including the previous two editions. Anquetil had shown good form before the Tour, as he won Paris–Nice, the Dauphiné Libéré, the Critérium National and the 1963 Vuelta a España. Anquetil was not sure if he would ride the Tour until a few days before the start; he had been infected by a tapeworm, and was advised not to start. Anquetil had chosen to ride races with tough climbs, to prepare for the 1963 Tour de France.\nThe major competitor was thought to be Raymond Poulidor, who had shown his capabilities in the 1962 Tour de France.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1963 Tour de France started on 23 June in Paris, and had one rest day, in Aurillac. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 16.\nRace overview.\nIn the first stage, four men escaped. One of them was Federico Bahamontes, the winner of the 1959 Tour de France. Bahamontes was known as a climber, so it was unexpected that he gained time on a flat stage. The third stage saw another successful breakaway. Seamus Elliott won the stage, and became the new leader in the race; it was the first time that an Irish cyclist led the Tour de France.\nThe time trial in stage 6b was won by Anquetil, with Poulidor in second place. Gilbert Desmet became the new leader. The situation did not change much in the next stages until the stages in the Pyrenees, starting with the tenth stage. Bahamontes lead the first group, but Anquetil was able to stay in that first group, which was a surprise. Anquetil stayed in that first group until the finish, where he outsprinted the rest to win his first mountain stage.\nIn the other two stages in the Pyrenees, Anquetil was able to stay in the first group, lost little time on his competitors, and kept getting closer to Desmet, who was still leading the general classification.\nThe fifteenth stage was the first in the Alps. Bahamontes won this stage, and in the general classification jumped to second place, three seconds ahead of Anquetil. In the sixteenth stage, Fernando Manzaneque won, eight minutes ahead of Bahamontes and Anquetil who stayed together. Because Desmet was further behind, Bahamontes became the new leader of the race, with a margin of three seconds on Anquetil.\nThe race was decided in the seventeenth stage. The rules in 1963 did not allow cyclists to change bicycles, unless there was a mechanical problem. Anquetil's team director, Raphaël Géminiani, thought that Anquetil could use a different bicycle on the ascent of the Col de la Forclaz, so he advised Anquetil to fake a mechanical problem on the start of that climb; Géminiani cut through a gear cable, and claimed that it snapped. Anquetil could thus use a light bicycle with lower gears, especially suited for a climb, which gave him an advantage on his competitors. Bahamontes reached the top of the Forclaz first, and only Anquetil had been able to follow him. After the top, Anquetil got his regular bicycle back, and rode to the finish together with Bahamontes. Anquetil won the sprint, and the bonus time made him the new leader. As expected, Anquetil won some more time in the time trial in stage 19, and became the winner of the 1963 Tour.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1963 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. The organisation had categorised some climbs as either first, second, third, or fourth-category; points for this classification were won by the first cyclists that reached the top of these climbs first, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time. The riders in the team that led this classification wore yellow caps. and the combined team IBAC-Molteni did not finish with three or more cyclists, so they were not included in the team classification.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, Rik Van Looy won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists.\nAftermath.\nAnquetil, who had been criticized that he just a time trial specialist, showed that he was also capable of mountain stages, and everybody agreed that Anquetil was the best cyclist overall.\nAnquetil was the first cyclist to win a fourth Tour de France. In the next year, he set the record sharper by winning his fifth Tour.\nThe French public had expected much from Raymond Poulidor, but Poulidor only made the eighth place. Normally, Poulidor was more popular than Anquetil even when Anquetil won, but this time Poulidor received \"contemptuous whistles\" at the finish in the Parc des Princes, while Anquetil received a standing ovation.\nAfter Anquetil and Géminiani had shown that the rule that bicycle changes were not allowed was easily circumvented by faking a mechanical problem, this rule was removed for the next year."

In 1954, Texas went 4–5–1, its first losing season in 15 years. After capping off three losing seasons in a row with a 1–9 season, the worst record in school history, Price tendered his resignation in 1956. He stayed on at Texas, first in the physical education department and later as assistant dean of students. Price died on March 1, 1976, at his home in Austin, Texas."

        "title": "Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show",
        "text": "The Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show, known through corporate sponsorship as the Super Bowl XXXVIII AOL TopSpeed Halftime Show took place on February 1, 2004, at the Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, as part of Super Bowl XXXVIII. It featured Janet Jackson, Justin Timberlake, P. Diddy, Nelly, Kid Rock, and Jessica Simpson.\nThe halftime show was produced by MTV, and the show was centered on the network's Choose or Lose campaign (the year 2004 was a presidential election year in the United States).\nImmense controversy arose from an incident during the show in which one of Jackson's breasts—adorned with a nipple shield—was exposed by Timberlake.\nBackground and development.\nIn 2002, \"Entertainment Weekly\" reported that Jackson was the original choice to perform at the halftime show for Super Bowl XXXVI; however, the NFL ultimately decided to select U2 to headline it after a group of NFL owners and officials attended the band's concert in New York City shortly after the September 11 attacks. In September 2003, the NFL announced that Jackson would be the headline performer of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show. Because the event was occurring during an election year, MTV, who was tasked with producing the show, decided that the theme would heavily focus on the network's \"Choose or Lose\" campaign, which encouraged younger viewers to be politically active and register to vote. AOL Topspeed spent $10 million to sponsor the show.\nPrior to the halftime show, Jackson and Timberlake had a friendship and working relationship. Timberlake attended Jackson's \"Rhythm Nation Tour\" as an adolescent, and Jackson's energetic dance routines and daring performing style made a deep impression on him. While Timberlake was a member of pop group 'N Sync, Jackson selected the boy band as the opening act for many dates of her blockbuster \"Velvet Rope World Tour\", which helped promote and introduce the then-relatively unknown group and Timberlake to the public worldwide. While on the tour, Jackson further promoted the group by performing with 'N Sync on several dates, including joining the group for a live a cappella duet of Stevie Wonder's \"Overjoyed\". Following the tour, Timberlake and Jackson became \"good friends\", with Jackson also praising Timberlake. When asked who he thought was \"the sexiest woman on the planet\", Timberlake said \"I've thought Janet Jackson has nothing but sex appeal, so I'd probably say her.\" Timberlake later asked Jackson to sing backing vocals on \"(And She Said) Take Me Now\", a song from his debut solo album \"Justified\".\nThe performance's sound engineer Patrick Baltzell complained of the acoustics in the stadium during the performance, recounting: “It was a disaster. You couldn’t understand a single lyric.” He stated that the shape of Reliant Stadium and its P.A. system produced a muffled sound, and stadium ownership as well as the NFL refused to allow Baltzell to place temporary speakers in locations that might block any fan's view of the stadium's video screens.\nSynopsis.\nThe performance was preceded by Sway Calloway introducing the show and its lineup in a voiceover, followed by a video montage encouraging people to vote. The montage featuring celebrities such as John Elway, Beyoncé, Tony Hawk, Jennifer Lopez, Elijah Wood, Chris Rock, Julia Roberts, Muhammad Ali, Jay-Z, Tom Cruise and others declaring things people can \"choose\", concluding with an urging that viewers choose to vote. The performance then began with a brief introduction by Jessica Simpson who shouted, \"Houston, choose to party!\". This was followed by a joint performance of \"The Way You Move\" by the University of Houston \"Spirit of Houston\" marching band and the Texas Southern University \"Ocean of Soul\" marching band.\nJackson then took stage to perform \"All for You\". At the start of the song, she descended in a stage elevator. \nFollowing this, lights dimmed and P. Diddy took stage on a secondary stage, located elsewhere on the field, emerging from a cloud of stage fog. He proceeded to perform \"Bad Boy for Life\". He was then joined by cheerleaders who performed a version of the song \"Mickey\", which substituted \"Diddy\", and later \"Nelly\", for \"Mickey\". Nelly then entered in a car, joining Diddy on stage to perform \"Hot in Herre\", during which the cheerleaders proceeded to remove articles of their clothing. Diddy then performed \"Mo Money Mo Problems\".\nFollowing this, Kid Rock took stage on yet another secondary stage, located elsewhere on the field, and performed \"Bawitdaba\" followed by \"Cowboy\". He did so wearing an American Flag as a poncho.\nJackson then took stage on the main stage again performing \"Rhythm Nation\" with the song's music video choreography. She donned mostly the same outfit she had during \"All for You\", with some differences, such as different skirt than before. Timberlake joined her, and performed \"Rock Your Body\" with her, at the end of which song he tore off a part of her top, revealing her breast (baring a nipple shield).\nThe show ended with voiceovers, again, declaring things to \"choose\", including getting involved.\nSetlist.\nSources:\nControversies.\n\"Nipplegate\".\nMajor controversy arose from the exposure of Jackson's right breast, which was adorned with a nipple shield. Jackson and Timberlake both denied the incident was intentional, with Timberlake characterizing it as a \"wardrobe malfunction\". The controversy had a long-lasting impact on media and popular culture.\nOther controversy.\nKid Rock received criticism from Veterans of Foreign Wars and Senator Zell Miller for wearing the American flag with one slit in the middle as a poncho during his performance. Kid Rock was accused of \"desecrating\" the flag."

        "title": "Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League",
        "text": "Paris Rugby League, doing business as Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League or PSG Rugby League, was a French professional rugby league football team that operated between 1995 and 1997, as a member of the Super League, Europe's highest tier.\nPSG RL played its first official game against Sheffield Eagles on 29 March 1996, which also marked the first game in Super League history. Built on an unconventional template, the team did not prove financially viable and disbanded after two seasons. The Super League re-entered the French territory in 2005, this time opting for a traditional market team, the Catalans Dragons, which has been considerably more successful.\nHistory.\nFrance Rugby League and Super League.\nIn 1994, veteran rugby union executive Jacques Fouroux, who had lost his political allies at the French Rugby Federation, switched codes and announced the creation of France Rugby League, a summer rugby league tour for regional selects teams that ran between seasons of the historic French championship, and aimed to grow the sport outside of its traditional markets, a move that shared similarities—albeit on a more modest scale—with Rupert Murdoch's projected European Super League. Rugby Football League CEO Maurice Lindsay voiced his support for the project, and in February 1995 mentioned Fouroux as the ideal entrepreneur to lead an expansion of the Super League to France. \nPSG partnership.\nAs a former rugby union executive, Fouroux had an existing relationship with top execs at TV channel Canal+, the parent company of Paris Saint-Germain F.C., which at the time was attempting to establish itself as a multisports club in the mold of Stade Français or Racing Club de France, having already endorsed basketball, team handball and volleyball sections. Due to its notoriety and ready-made connections with the broadcasting world, he quickly saw the PSG brand as the ideal vehicle for his provisionally named Paris Rugby League club. A second team based in Toulouse was also considered, before it was decided to focus the French game's limited resources on Paris. The choice of the capital was resented by the leadership of some traditional southern clubs. With the Super League expanding beyond the Channel, France Rugby League was re-positioned as a developmental circuit for the new Paris team.\nParis Rugby League, now renamed Paris Saint-Germain Rugby League, was officially announced as PSG's newest department on 23 December 1995. France Rugby League's Paris–Île-de-France selects team took the name PSG Espoirs Île-de-France ('PSG Île-de-France Prospects'). The alliance also yielded a watershed three-year broadcasting agreement with Canal+.\nFounder Jacques Fouroux was appointed as team president. Tas Baitieri, a France-based Australian player-turned-executive with a long experience serving as a go-between between his adopted country and the game's Anglo-Saxon authorities, was named as the team's football manager. Baitieri was allowed to work for Paris despite also being employed by the Australian Rugby League, at the time embroiled in a bitter rivalry with the Super League. The entire PSG RL organization came together in short order, taking only eight months to go from the drawing board to its competitive debut, a hectic schedule which Baitieri negatively compared with the three years typically afforded to an ARL expansion franchise.\nInaugural season.\nThe initial plan was to run the Paris team, coached by former French national coach Michel Mazaré, on the same model as the teams of France Rugby League: a select squad drawing its players from existing French championship clubs, albeit one whose territory would encompass the entire French rugby league membership rather than a single region. However it soon became clear, due to the French game's decline over the preceding decades, as well as overlap between the final stretch of the French championship and the early weeks of Super League, that additional players would need to be recruited. Halfway into the season, the team lost founding figures Fouroux and Baitieri (the former unexpectedly returning to rugby union and the later fulfilling his obligations to the ARL), leaving various RFL and French federation executives to wrestle for control of the team as the logistical and financial challenges of Fouroux's initial plan were fast becoming apparent. Despite several foreign additions throughout the season, PSG only barely escaped relegation, finishing in 11th place only two points ahead of last-place Workington Town. This was, however, in line with management's own pre-season projections.\nReorganization and second season.\nFor the second season, the team abandoned the selects concept entirely, and relied on full-timers. The coaching job went to Australian Peter Mulholland (who was replaced by Englishman Andy Goodway after a slow start), while the share allocated to domestic players greatly decreased under both the RFL's pressure for better results, and an increasing lack of cooperation from more storied French clubs, who resented loaning their talent to a propped-up Paris side. The team's mounting financial issues lead its parent organization to temporarily strip it of the PSG name in the middle of the season, and further negative attention arose when it was publicized that many of its imports were salaried in the U.K. rather than France, as part of a tax avoidance scheme. The results marginally improved to 6 wins, although the team again finished in 11th place. In addition to the Super League, PSG RL also played in the Challenge Cup, the reborn World Club Challenge and an expanded Premiership Trophy that season, without notable results.\nDisbanding.\nWhile the team managed to avoid relegation on the field, its peculiar business model and lack of history in the market stood in the way of profitability, and it was disbanded at the end of the season . Former PSG member Laurent Lucchese assessed: \"I understand why Jacques Fouroux at the start wanted a team in Paris, to promote the sport and get the TV coverage in Charléty, but I think we should have moved the club [...] to be closer to supporters and play in different spots in the south of France. A club without any roots can’t live long.\"\nBusiness model.\nFollowing in the footsteps of France Rugby League, PSG attempted to grow the sport past its traditional demographics, and was entirely geared towards a casual audience. The spectator experience was hyped up as much as the on-field product, with a pre-game show that featured pyrotechnics and musical performances. In order to further maximize the team's reach, most tickets were distributed for free (traveling fans from the U.K. still had to pay for admission), and were offered as an incentive for sponsors, who could distribute them as customer rewards. The spectacle of generous crowds, amplified by the thorough television coverage expected from PSG parent Canal+, was supposed to create a virtuous circle, attracting more corporate sponsors and pushing the team into the black.\nBased on spectacular attendance figures at early games, the strategy was praised, with Bradford chairman Chris Caisley crediting Paris as the only club other than his own \"who really tried\" to live up to the Super League's mainstream aspirations. However, by its own admission, the hastily thrown together team had launched without any significant corporate sponsor attached to its name. Beyond a prestigious name, the Paris Saint-Germain alliance did not bring much financial security either, as the big club did not actually own the team, and the ancillary support it provided was in line with what rugby union's Stade Français was receiving despite not bearing the PSG name. With only peripheral involvement, Canal+ had little incentive to put all its weight behind rugby league, and the vaunted broadcasting deal rarely amounted to more than highlights packages.\nIn the end, PSG RL never developed the requisite network of corporate partners, with many tickets disseminated via public institutions, while Murdoch and the RFL were left to absorb most of its losses. By the end of the second season, RFL chairman Rodney Walker—a political rival of RFL CEO and PSG cheerleader Maurice Lindsay—had enough. In late October 1997, he declared, \"We have decided we can no longer offer to subsidize the Paris club. They have to find ways to generate income, which they have not done to date.\" With little hope of surviving on its own, the team was wound up shortly after.\nPartway into the 2023–24 Ligue 2 season, soccer's Paris FC, also playing out of Charléty Stadium, announced that it would transition to a similar free admission scheme in hopes of boosting its sagging attendance at the notoriously unpopular venue.\nLegacy.\nFrench Rugby League Federation president Jean-Paul Ferré vowed to come back with a new team as part of a proposed 1999 expansion. Paris was briefly considered, however the more likely location this time was Toulouse. Neither happened, but the door eventually re-opened in 2002, when French clubs were invited by to tender for a place in the Super League. While some again viewed Toulouse Olympique as the favorite at the beginning of the selection process, Perpignan's Catalans Dragons were ultimately chosen, making their debut in 2006.\nThe professional experience brought back by PSG players to their French league clubs was credited for making the Dragons' transition to Super League a smoother one. \"LeMonde.fr\" also named Fouroux's aggressive promotional tactics at PSG as a precursor to union team Stade Français' more widely recognized marketing efforts under president Max Guazzini. The club also earned notice for being the first in the RFL system to entrust a managerial position to a woman, Rebecca Cove."

        "title": "Lacrosse in England",
        "text": "Lacrosse in England is an amateur sport played mainly by community based clubs and university teams. Field lacrosse was introduced to England in 1876 by William George Beers and other Canadians who toured the country playing exhibition matches. A second tour was arranged in 1883; by then England had 60 clubs playing regular fixtures in Cambridgeshire, Cheshire, Lancashire, Middlesex and Yorkshire.\nThe first national governing body for the men's game, the English Lacrosse Union, was formed in 1892. A Ladies' Lacrosse Association followed in 1912. The separate men's and women's organisations merged in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association, which was renamed England Lacrosse in 2019. England Lacrosse oversees both the men's and women's national teams.\nMen's lacrosse.\nMen's club lacrosse in England is divided into parallel northern and southern leagues generally running from late September to early April. Each league also organises its own knockout competition known as 'Flags', which culminate in their respective 'Flags Finals' at the close of each season. In addition to the regular season, English clubs host a number of internationally popular tournaments, including Bath 8s, Bluesfest, and the Nick Kehoe International.\nNorthern clubs are governed by the North of England Men's Lacrosse Association (NEMLA), which was formed in 1897 when 10 clubs began playing regular fixtures. NEMLA now comprises a Premiership and four further senior divisions.\nThe South of England Men's Lacrosse Association (SEMLA) formed on 15 March 1882 and governs clubs across southern England and Wales. As of the 2019/20 season the League consists of the Premier Division, two further senior divisions (Division 1 and Division 2), and three regional feeder divisions. For the 2018/19 season SEMLA created a new Local League to run alongside the main league to boost the number of competitive fixtures while reducing the travel commitment.\nThe winner of the play-off between northern and southern league champions goes forward to compete against other European league champions for the Ken Galluccio Cup in Ghent, Belgium each year. English clubs are the most successful in the tournament to date with eight out of eleven titles. Stockport are the most successful club in the tournament's history with four titles, while Hampstead, Poynton, Spencer, and Wilmslow have each won one title.\nThe main focus of men's lacrosse popularity in England is in Manchester and the North West. Greater Manchester has hosted the World Lacrosse Championship in 1978, 1994, and 2010. A second centre is in the South East, especially in and around London.\nMen's lacrosse is a common minority sport in universities, which along with club-based youth programs, provide the majority of newcomers with their first experience of the sport. In 2008, a men's BUCS league was introduced, providing greater support and recognition to the men's university teams.\nThe University of Cambridge has the distinction of being the oldest university lacrosse club in the UK having formed in 1882 and have contested the Varsity Match with the University of Oxford every year since 1903, excluding during the world wars. Oxford lead the series 60-39-5.\nWomen's lacrosse.\nMcCrone credits lacrosse's limited popularity with Victorian men for its adoption by many girls' public schools in the 1890s. In 1905 former students from Wycombe Abbey, Roedean and Prior's Field schools formed the first women's lacrosse club in England, the Southern Ladies' Lacrosse Club. The club played against sides from public schools and was captained by Audrey Beaton, an Old Roedeanian. In 1912 Beaton led the establishment of the Ladies' Lacrosse Association, which included school teams; Beaton became honorary secretary and Penelope Lawrence, Roedean headmistress, was its first president.\nThe LLA expanded rapidly and established a national team in March 1913. A rivalry with field hockey developed when some girls' schools replaced hockey with lacrosse, but lacrosse remained a more minor sport.\nA close relationship between the LLA and the men's English Lacrosse Union was consolidated with a merger in 1996 to form the English Lacrosse Association. Today, club women's lacrosse is governed by the South East Women's Lacrosse Association (SEWLA), South West Women's Lacrosse Association (SWWLA), and North Women's Lacrosse Association (NWLA).\nYouth.\nLacrosse is often introduced to boys and girls with a soft stick and ball version of the game called pop lacrosse. Since 1982, the English Lacrosse Association has brought over one thousand coaches from outside the U.K. to teach young players the game.\nInternational.\nEngland, Scotland and Wales compete as separate teams in international competitions. In the men's 2006 World Lacrosse Championship England finished in 5th place and in the Women's Lacrosse World Cup in 2005, England finished 3rd. In the men's 2007 World Indoor Lacrosse Championship England finished in 4th place.\nIn the 2008, 2012 and 2016 European Lacrosse Championships England successfully defended their title in the Men's competition, and came second in the Women's competition.\nThe 2010 World Lacrosse Championships were held in Manchester, England from 16 to 24 July at the Manchester University Sports Ground, The Armitage Centre. The England team finished the tournament in 5th place."

        "title": "2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage",
        "text": "The knockout stage was the second and final stage of the 2006 FIFA World Cup, following the group stage. The top two teams from each group (16 in total) advance to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament. A match was played between the two losing teams of the semi-finals to determine which team finished in third place.\n\"All times local (CEST/UTC+2)\"\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the eight groups qualified for the knockout stage.\nRound of 16.\nGermany vs Sweden.\nGermany progressed thanks to two goals from Lukas Podolski inside the opening 12 minutes. His first was in the fourth minute; German captain Michael Ballack sent a pass to Miroslav Klose, who was tackled by goalkeeper Andreas Isaksson, only for an onrushing Podolski to turn the ball in. Eight minutes later, a pass from Klose found Podolski, who scored his second goal. On 35 minutes, Teddy Lučić received a second yellow card for a foul on Klose. In the 52nd minute, Henrik Larsson won a penalty for Sweden when he was challenged by Christoph Metzelder, only for Larsson himself to shoot the ball over the crossbar. Germany held out for a 2–0 win.\nSwitzerland vs Ukraine.\nDespite their early elimination, Switzerland became the first team in the history of the FIFA World Cup to leave an edition of the tournament without conceding a single goal.\nQuarter-finals.\nGermany vs Argentina.\nArgentina took the lead through Roberto Ayala early in the second half, but the South Americans’ goalkeeper Roberto Abbondanzieri was injured after the goal and his replacement Leo Franco was unable to stop Miroslav Klose from equalizing with ten minutes left in regulation time. The match went to extra time. With no goals scored, the semifinal spot came down to penalties, during which German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann was seen looking at a piece of paper kept in his sock before each Argentinian player would come forward for a penalty kick. Lehmann had researched the penalty taking habits of seven players on the Argentinian team. However, only two players on his list ended up taking a penalty that day. On the attempts by those two players, Lehmann saved one and came close to saving the other. He then had to guess on Esteban Cambiasso's kick since he did not have any information written on his list about Cambiasso. However, he derived an educated guess from the videos he had studied and pretended to read the piece of paper and nodded his head before putting it away, implying to Cambiasso that he did in fact have information on the kicker. Lehmann guessed correctly and saved the penalty, thus winning the shootout for Germany. \"Lehmann's list\" became so popular in the annals of German football history that it is now in the Haus der Geschichte museum.\nBrazil vs France.\nDefending world champions Brazil went out in the quarter-finals after Zinedine Zidane found an unmarked Thierry Henry from a free kick, the striker having been given a free run at the ball after his marker, Roberto Carlos, stopped to tie his shoe.\nSemi-finals.\nGermany vs Italy.\nThis was the fourth time that Italy defeated the host nation of tournament, after France in 1938, Mexico in 1970 and Argentina in 1978.\nThird place play-off.\nThis was the third time that Portugal lost to the host nation of tournament, after England in 1966 and South Korea in 2002.\nFinal.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;"

        "text": "Ice hockey is a sport that is contested at the Winter Olympic Games. A men's ice hockey tournament has been held every Winter Olympics (starting in 1924); an ice hockey tournament was also held at the 1920 Summer Olympics. From 1920 to 1968, the Olympics also acted as the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the two events occurred concurrently. From 1920 until 1984, only amateur athletes were allowed to compete in the tournament, and players from the National Hockey League (NHL) were not allowed to compete. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. In 1970, after a disagreement over the definition of amateur players, Canada withdrew from the tournament and did not send a team to the 1972 or 1976 Winter Olympics. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided to allow professional athletes to compete in the Olympics, and starting in 1998, the NHL allowed its players to participate. Women's ice hockey was added in 1992 and the first tournament was held at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Both events have been held at every Olympic Games since.\nIn women's hockey, Canadians Jayna Hefford and Hayley Wickenheiser hold the record for total medals (five), having won four gold and one silver. Their team mate Caroline Ouellette also won four gold medals. Five other athletes have won four medals: three Canadians – Becky Kellar, Jennifer Botterill, and Marie-Philip Poulin with three gold and a silver – and three Americans - Angela Ruggiero, Jenny Potter (each with one gold, two silver and one bronze) and Julie Chu (three silver and one bronze).\nEight male athletes have won four medals: Russians Vladislav Tretiak (three gold, one silver) and Igor Kravchuk (two gold, one silver, one bronze), Czech Jiří Holík (two silver, two bronze) and five players from Finland, each with one silver and three bronze: Teemu Selänne, Kimmo Timonen, Saku Koivu, Jere Lehtinen and Ville Peltonen. Six have won three gold medals (all from Russia): Tretiak, Anatoli Firsov, Viktor Kuzkin, Andrei Khomutov, Alexander Ragulin and Vitali Davydov.\nFrom 1920 to 1952, teams from Canada dominated the men's tournament, winning six gold and one silver medal. Canada's dominance was broken only by Great Britain in 1936. The Soviet Union began competing at the Olympics in 1956 and won nine straight Olympic medals, including seven gold. The USSR's dominance was only broken by the United States in 1960 and 1980. The Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, and in 1992, a Unified Team composed mainly of former Soviet players won gold. Since then, the competition has been more even, with Canada winning three times, Sweden twice and the Czech Republic, Russia and Finland once each. Teams from Canada have won the most medals, with fifteen, including nine gold. As of the 2018 Winter Olympics, 90 medals (30 of each color) have been awarded to teams from 14 National Olympic Committees.\nMen.\nIndividuals who have been inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame (including announced members awaiting induction) are indicated as follows:\nWomen.\nIndividuals who have been inducted to the Hockey Hall of Fame (including announced members awaiting induction) are indicated as follows:\nNotes.\nNote 2.

        "title": "USA Gymnastics",
        "text": "United States of America Gymnastics (USA Gymnastics or USAG) is the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States. Established in 1963 as the U.S. Gymnastics Federation (USGF), USA Gymnastics selects and trains the men's and women's national teams for the Olympic Games and World Championships. USAG sets the rules and policies that govern the sport of gymnastics, promotes the sport at all levels, and serves as a resource center for members, clubs, fans and gymnasts.\nThe programs governed by USAG are:\nThe women's artistic program holds multiple nationally televised competitions each year.\nThe USAG was central to the largest sex-abuse scandal in sports history. In 2016, two decades of widespread sexual abuse of athletes, mostly minors, by coaches and other people overseen by USAG came to light. This led to federal and state investigations and prosecutions, and the resignations of the USAG president and board. In 2018, the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) began to decertify the USAG as a national governing body but put the process on hold after USAG declared bankruptcy; it ultimately decided not to act in 2021, citing the organization's reform efforts. More than 500 athletes sued USAG and USOPC, alleging that the organizations were partially culpable for their sexual assaults; in 2021, the organizations settled the lawsuits for $380 million.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nUSAG was established in 1963 as the U.S. Gymnastics Federation.\nThe need for a governing body had begun to appear at the 1959 Pan American Games, when friction developed between the games' organizers, the Amateur Athletic Union, and the Olympic Gymnastics Committee. The NCAA was dissatisfied as well, and asked the National Association of Gymnastics Coaches to begin planning for a new national governing body. The U.S. Gymnastics Federation was established in 1963. But resistance by the AAU, which was loath to relinquish control over gymnastics, and other factors meant that the new federation was not internationally recognized as the governing body of U.S. gymnastics until 1970.\nThe organization renamed itself USA Gymnastics in 1993.\nSex abuse scandal.\nIn 1990, USA Gymnastics began to keep a list of people permanently banned from coaching for sexual abuse and other reasons. \nFor example, the list includes Robert Dean Head, a USAG coach in Kentucky who in 1992 pled guilty to raping a 12-year-old, and Don Peters, the national coach for the 1984 Olympic team, who was banned in 2011 after two former gymnasts accused him of sexual abuse. USAG began requiring background checks for coaches in 2007.\nYet by 1996, and possibly much earlier, USAG officials had begun a pattern of concealing and enabling sexual assaults on gymnasts by coaches and others.\nUSAG leaders routinely dismissed complaints and warnings about coaches. For example, USAG received complaints about coach Mark Schiefelbein long before he was convicted in 2003 of molesting a 10-year-old girl. USAG officials would admit under oath in 2013 that allegations of sexual abuse were routinely dismissed as hearsay unless they came directly from a victim or victim's parent.\nEven when USAG leaders believed the accusers, they sometimes allowed coaches to continue coaching for years. For example, they waited four years before telling the police that they had received credible allegations of sexual assault by Marvin Sharp, who became a USAG coach in 2010 and was jailed in 2015 on state and local charges of misconduct with a minor and possession of child pornography.\nUSAG leaders even permitted coaches and others who were convicted of crimes to remain in the sport for years afterward. Documents released in the prosecution of Georgia coach William McCabe revealed how USAG responded to sexual misconduct allegations made against coaches from 1996 to 2006. One letter says a USAG regional chair spoke to the organization's president in support of allowing a convicted sex offender to keep his membership. Other documents include sexual abuse complaints filed against 54 coaches, many of whom were convicted of crimes yet allowed by USAG to continue in the sport for years.\nHundreds more alleged sexual assaults came to light in 2016, when the \"Indianapolis Star\" began publishing the results of a nine-month investigation into the sexual abuse of gymnasts and the role that USAG had played in them. The \"Star\" found that the abuses were widespread because \"predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight, or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnastics-certified gyms\".\nUSAG CEO Steve Penny was forced to resign in March 2017, but received a $1 million severance package. Among other actions, Penny had waited weeks to notify the FBI of sexual abuse allegations against Larry Nassar, the national team doctor through four Olympic cycles. Penny was arrested the following year on charged of destroying or hiding documents related to Nassar’s activities at the Karolyi Ranch. The charges were ultimately dismissed due to lack of evidence, but led to several reforms of the law by Congress. USAG placed Penny on its \"permanently ineligible\" list of members.\nUSAG hired a former federal prosecutor to develop recommendations to reform its policies related to sexual misconduct. In June 2017, Deborah J. Daniels released a report with 70 recommendations, including removing the \"athlete representative\" from the Olympic selection committee, so athletes would be less afraid to report abuses.\nUSA Gymnastics cut ties with the Karolyi Ranch in the wake of the scandal, after several gymnasts said they had been abused by Nassar on the premises. The ranch, operated by Béla Károlyi and his wife, former national team coordinator Márta Károlyi, had been the official US Women's National Team Training Center since 2001. Marta was replaced in 2016 by Valeri Liukin, a Soviet Olympic medalist and owner of World Olympic Gymnastics Academy; Liukin would resign two years later due to his own involvement in the sex abuse scandal.\nIn 2018, Nassar pleaded guilty to sexually abusing over 300 female athletes, including Olympic gold medalists Aly Raisman and Jordyn Wieber. Following his sentencing, the United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOPC) threatened to decertify USA Gymnastics unless the entire board resigned. USA Gymnastics complied and all 21 board members resigned on January 26. Olympic medalist McKayla Maroney has filed a lawsuit alleging that USA Gymnastics paid her to keep silent about Nassar's abuse. Gymnasts have called for those who protected Nassar, including in the USOPC and USA Gymnastics, to be held accountable for their actions.\nIn September 2018, USA Gymnastics fired its elite development director for women, Mary Lee Tracy, who was heavily criticized for initially defending Nassar. USOPC's new CEO Sarah Hirshland said that it was \"time to consider making adjustments in the leadership\" of USA Gymnastics; two days later, USA Gymnastics president Kerry Perry was forced to resign. \nOn November 5, 2018, the USOPC announced that it was starting the process to decertify USAG as the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States. One month later, USA Gymnastics filed for bankruptcy. In February 2019, the USOPC halted its decertification efforts, citing USAG's bankruptcy.\nOn February 19, 2019, USA Gymnastics appointed a new president and CEO: Li Li Leung, a former gymnast who had most recently served as a vice president at the National Basketball Association (NBA). Leung said she \"was upset and angry to learn about the abuse and the institutions that let the athletes down. I admire the courage and strength of the survivors, and...will make it a priority to see that their claims are resolved.\"\nIn 2020, Congress passed and U.S. President Donald Trump signed the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic and Amateur Athletes Act, which gave athletes more protections from sexual and other abuse by coaches and employees in Olympic and Paralympic sports and more representation in decision-making roles. The Act increased federation funding for the U.S. Center for SafeSport to $20 million, gave the USOPC exclusive authority to respond to sexual abuse and sexual allegations of misconduct within the USOPC and national governing bodies, established a bipartisan committee to do a review of the USOPC, and empowered the Congress to dissolve the USOPC and decertify NGBs if they fail to follow through on reforms.\nOn February 25, 2021, the U.S. state of Michigan charged former USA Gymnastics coach John Geddert with 24 felonies including human trafficking and forced labor, first degree sexual assault, second degree sexual assault, racketeering, and lying to police. Geddert was the U.S. national team coach at the 2012 London Olympics and was closely affiliated with Nassar. Geddert died by suicide the same day.\nIn 2021, the USOPC decided not to decertify USAG as national governing body, citing the organization's reform efforts. That same year, USOPC and USAG settled the sex-abuse lawsuits for $380 million.\nPrograms.\nWomen's Artistic programs.\nThe Women's Artistic programs includes the vault, uneven bars, balance beam, and floor exercise events.\nElite Program.\nThe Elite Program consists of regional and national training programs and competitions designed for athletes aspiring to represent the United States in international competition. Athletes participate at Developmental, Open, Pre-Elite, and National Team training camps. Only athletes at the National Team level are called \"elite gymnasts\". There are two Elite groups: Junior Elite (ages 11–15) and Senior Elite (ages 16+).\nAnnual elite-level competitions include the American Cup, U.S. Classic, and U.S. Championships, as well as multiple National Qualifying Meets throughout the year. Junior and Senior National Teams are selected based on performance at the U.S. Championships. These athletes then compete at the World Championships. In Olympic years, elite gymnasts compete at the Summer Olympics.\nTo get to the elite level, a gymnast must pass the elite compulsory and optional qualifiers. In elite compulsory qualifiers, gymnasts compete a basic routine designed by organizers to demonstrate that the gymnast has all the basic skills, including twists, handsprings, jumps, leaps, kips to cast handstand, giants, turns, and more. In elite optionals, the gymnast is evaluated for advanced skills and moves, such as pak saltos, releases, complex dismounts, multiple tucks/twists, double layouts, twisting vaults, and more. In optionals, gymnasts create their own routines.\nTalent Opportunity Program.\nThe Talent Opportunity Program (TOPs) seeks to identify talented female gymnasts aged 7–10 for training up to the elite level. State and regional evaluations are followed by a national test of physical abilities and basic gymnastics skills in October of each year. This is followed by a national training camp in December for those who qualify.\nOlympics Hopefuls program.\nThe Olympics Hopefuls program (HOPEs) is a program to identify talented gymnasts, generally aged 11–14, and train them to an advanced level. In order to qualify for HOPEs, a gymnast must pass both the elite compulsory and optional qualifiers, and get a certain minimum score. HOPEs Elite gymnasts compete at elite meets, but not as a Junior Elite.\nWomen's Development Program.\nThe Women's Development Program (previously the Junior Olympic program) provides training, evaluation, and competition opportunities to allow developing gymnasts to safely advance at their own pace through specific skill levels. Most competitive gymnasts advance through this system.\n Since August 1, 2013, the levels are:\nSkills are grouped by degree of difficulty and given the letter ratings A–E, with A denoting the easiest skills. Levels 6–8 have difficulty restrictions, in that a gymnast competing at one of these levels may not attempt skills above a certain level of difficulty (for example, level 6 and 7 gymnasts may only include A and B skills in their routines). Levels 9 and 10 have no such difficulty restrictions, although level 9 gymnasts may include only one D or E skill in any single routine.\nIn addition to demonstrating the necessary skills, gymnasts must reach a minimum age to advance to the next level. For example, level 8 and 9 gymnasts must be at least 8 years old; level 10 gymnasts must be at least 9 years old. Regardless of age, all beginning gymnasts enter the program at level 1 and may advance through more than one level per year. Competitions for gymnasts at level 7 culminate in State Championships, level 8 at Regional Championships, level 9 at Eastern or Western Championships, and level 10 at Junior Olympic National Championships.\nOriginally, the developmental levels were numbered 1–4, the compulsory levels 5–6, and the optional levels 7–10. One August 1, 2013, the old levels 1 and 2 were combined into the new level 1; level 7 was split into the new levels 6 and 7; and levels 3–6 were shifted down one level.\nXcel Program.\nThe Xcel Program provides training and competition experience for gymnasts outside of the traditional Junior Olympic program. Its stated purpose is \"to provide gymnasts of varying abilities and commitment levels, the opportunity for a rewarding gymnastics experience.\" Participants compete in individual and team competitions in Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, and Diamond divisions, based on age and ability level.As of August 2023, a new Sapphire division has been added in hopes to \"provide additional growth opportunities our athletes, clubs, and coaches.\"\nGymnastics for All (GfA).\nThe Gymnastics for All (GfA) discipline consists of five independent programs: Group Performance, Gym for Life Challenge, TeamGym, Acrobatics and Tumbling Development, and HUGS (Special Needs). Local and regional meets are held throughout the year and a \"GFA National Championships and GymFest\" is hosted in the summer season for the competitive programs with non-competitive showcase opportunities. The discipline is managed by a program committee and a USA Gymnastics technical director, currently Lori Laznovsky.\nThe discipline also provides opportunities for international performance and competition through the non-competitive World Gymnaestrada and the competitive \"World Gym For Life Challenge\".\nTeamGym.\nTeamGym, formerly Power TeamGym, is a competitive sport in which teams of 6 to 12 gymnasts, called squads, perform Tumbling, Trampet, and Floor routines. These routines are scored by judges and summed to determine rankings. Squads can compete in levels 1 through 10. Until 2024, gymnasts competed in separate male, female, and mixed groups.\nTumbling and Trampet routines are set to music and consist of a number of passes in which gymnasts perform skills one after another in quick succession, commonly referred to as \"streaming\". Tumbling is competed on an inflatable air track and Trampet is competed in two sections: Vault and Mini-tramp.\nThe Floor exercise is a timed performance in which the squad of gymnasts complete choreographed elements in synch on a spring floor."

        "text": "Charles William Moore Jr. (born June 21, 1953) is a former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily as a catcher and outfielder (1973–1987). He played 14 seasons with the Milwaukee Brewers, and one season with the Toronto Blue Jays.\nEarly years.\nMoore attended Minor High School in his hometown of Birmingham, Alabama, and in June 1971 was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fifth round of the 1971 MLB draft. He played in the Brewers' minor league system from 1971 through 1973, with the short season Class A Newark Co-Pilots (1971), Single-A Danville Warriors (1972), Double-A Shreveport Captains (1973), and Triple-A Evansville Triplets (1973).\nMajor league career.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nMoore made his major league debut with the Brewers on September 8, 1973, during a 15–1 loss to the New York Yankees. He appeared in a total of eight games late in the 1973 season, batting 5-for-27 (.185) with three RBIs. During the 1974 and 1975 seasons, Moore played 72 games (batting .245) and 73 games (batting .290), respectively. He played defensively at catcher through August 1975, then mostly as a left fielder through May 1976, at which time he returned to catching. During the 1976 season, he appeared in 87 games, batting .191 with three home runs and 16 RBIs. On October 3, 1976, at Milwaukee County Stadium, Moore was the last runner batted in by Hank Aaron, crossing the plate on Aaron's sixth-inning single in the Brewers' 5–2 loss to the Detroit Tigers.\nMoore's playing time then increased, as he appeared in 138 games in 1977 (batting .248), 96 games in 1978 (batting .269), and 111 games in both 1979 and 1980 (batting .300 and then .291). Moore hit for the cycle on October 1, 1980, in a Brewers 10–7 win over the California Angels. He also had two stolen bases in the game, becoming the only MLB player to have two steals in a game while also hitting for the cycle.\nDuring the strike shortened 1981 season, Moore appeared in 48 games, batting a career-high .301. He batted 2-for-9 (.222) in the 1981 ALDS, which the Brewers lost to the Yankees, 3 games to 2. Moore played 133 games in 1982, batting .254 and had 13 outfield assists, in his first year playing predominantly in right field. He hit 6-for-13 (.462) in the 1982 ALCS, and made an important defensive play in the fifth inning of the final game, throwing out Reggie Jackson at third base from right field, as the Brewers defeated the Angels, 3 games to 2. Moore then hit .346 (9-for-26) with three doubles and two RBIs in the 1982 World Series, which the Brewers lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.\nMoore continued to play in right field during the next two seasons; in 1983 he played in a career-high 151 games, batting .284, and in 1984 he played in just 70 games while batting .234. During his final two seasons with Milwaukee, Moore returned to catching, playing in 105 games and batting .232 in 1985, and playing in 80 games and batting .260 in 1986. In November 1986, Moore became a free agent. The Brewers offered him a one-year contract, but with a significant pay cut (20 or 30 percent) as he only would have played in about 40 games; Moore called the offer \"disgusting and insulting\".\nIn his 14 seasons with the Brewers, Moore appeared in 1283 regular season games, batting .262 with 35 home runs and 401 RBIs.\nToronto Blue Jays.\nMoore did not get signed by a major league team to start the 1987 season, so he played with the Single-A San Jose Bees through May. Later comments from Moore linked his lack of offers to collusion by owners. In early June, he was signed by the Toronto Blue Jays. Moore appeared in 51 games with the Blue Jays, batting .215 with one home run and seven RBIs. In the offseason, the Blue Jays did not re-sign Moore, bringing his career to a close.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter his playing career ended, and for more than fifteen years, Moore worked as a sales representative for a fastener company in his hometown of Birmingham.\nIn 2014, Moore was selected to the All-Time Alabama Baseball Team and to the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor.\nExternal links.\n, or Retrosheet"

        "title": "1923 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1923 Stanley Cup playoffs was the second year in which the National Hockey League (NHL) champions, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champions, and the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) champions all competed for the Stanley Cup. The playoffs began on March 16, 1923, and concluded on March 31 when the NHL champion Ottawa Senators defeated the WCHL champion Edmonton Eskimos in the final series, two games to zero.\nThroughout these playoffs, injuries had thinned Ottawa's line-up. But after seeing the gritty show put on by the undermanned Senators, Frank Patrick, the head coach of the PCHA champion Vancouver Maroons, called Ottawa the greatest team he had ever seen.\nBackground.\nOttawa finished first overall in the 1922–23 NHL regular season standings with a 14–9–1 record. They then went on to defeat the 13–9–2 second place Montreal Canadiens in the two-game total goal NHL championship series, 3 goals to 2, to win the NHL title. Cy Denneny scored the series-clinching goal in Game 2 for the Canadiens.\nThe 1922–23 WCHL season ended with the 19–10–1 first place Eskimos defeating the 16–14 second place Regina Capitals in the WCHL championship series. Edmonton clinched the WCHL title after Duke Keats scored the series-winning overtime goal in Game 2.\nMeanwhile, the Maroons finished the 1922–23 PCHA regular season in first place with a 17–12–1 record, and then went on to defeat the 16–14 second place Victoria Cougars in the PCHA championship series by a combined score of 5–3.\nCup Playoffs summary.\nBoth rounds of the 1923 Stanley Cup playoffs were played at Denman Street Arena in Vancouver. The NHL and the PCHA champions played in the semifinal round, with the winner facing the WCHL champion in the Cup Final.\nSemi-final: Ottawa Senators defeat Vancouver Maroons, three games to one.\nThe Ottawa-Vancouver best-of-five series marked the first time in Stanley Cup history that brothers faced each other. In fact, there were two sets of brothers: Cy and Corb Denneny, and George and Frank Boucher. Cy and George played for the Senators, while Corb and Frank skated for the Maroons. A third Boucher brother, Billy, was to have replaced Ottawa's Jack Darragh who was injured, but Frank Patrick, the PCHA president, disallowed Billy from joining the Senators.\nOttawa won the first game 1–0, with Punch Broadbent's winning goal in the third period. Vancouver, led by two goals by Duncan and two by Frank Boucher, took the second game 4–1, which led to more injuries for the Senators. Benedict took a puck in the mouth, Gerard was injured due to a heavy check and Cy Denneny injured his elbow. The Senators again asked if Billy Boucher could join the team, but were again refused by Patrick. In the third game, the Senators lost Gerard to a dislocated shoulder, but won the game 3–2. King Clancy took his place for the fourth game, and the Senators won it 5–1, to win the series. Broadbent ended up leading Ottawa with five goals in the series. After watching the gritty show by the undermanned Senators, Patrick called them the greatest team he had ever seen.\nFinal: Ottawa Senators defeat Edmonton Eskimos, 2 games to 0.\nOttawa swept Edmonton in the best-of-three final series, winning both games by one-goal margins. In the first game, Cy Denneny scored 2:08 into overtime to give the Senators a 2–1 win. Then Punch Broadbent scored the only goal in the second game to give Ottawa a 1–0 victory and the championship.\nCup engravings.\nThe Senators never did engrave their names on the Cup for their 1923 championship. It was only until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1923 Ottawa Senators\" were put onto its then-new collar."

        "text": "The 2010 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 65 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2009–10 basketball season. The 72nd annual edition of the tournament began on March 16, 2010, and concluded with the championship game on April 5, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nThe Final Four consisted of Duke, making their first appearance since 2004, West Virginia, who were making their second appearance and first since 1959, Butler, considered the host school and making their first ever appearance, and Michigan State, the national runner-up from 2009 appearing in the Final Four for the sixth time under head coach Tom Izzo.\nWhen Duke and Butler played each other in the tournament final, it was the first title game between private universities in 25 years (Villanova and Georgetown met in 1985), and the fifth such match-up in history (1942, 1954, and 1955 having been the other years). Duke defeated Butler 61–59 in the championship game as Gordon Hayward's last second desperation shot clanged off the rim. It was Duke's first national championship since 2001 and fourth overall.\nEntering the tournament, the top four seeds were Kansas, Duke, Kentucky, and Syracuse. Kansas entered the Tournament as the overall No. 1 seed but was defeated in the opening weekend by Northern Iowa, the No. 9 seed in the Midwest region. Northern Iowa was one of four teams seeded lower than No. 8 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, joining the East Region's No. 11 seed Washington, No. 12 seed Cornell and the South Region's No. 10 seed Saint Mary's.\nFor the first time since 2006, a No. 14 seed advanced out of the first round as Ohio defeated Georgetown. The No. 13 seed in the West Region, Murray State, defeated No. 4-seeded Vanderbilt, marking the second consecutive appearance for the Commodores where they lost as a No. 4 seed. Murray State very nearly upset Butler in their next game, losing by two points.\nOne of the more exciting games of the tournament was played at the West Regional in Salt Lake City, as No. 6 Xavier took No. 2 Kansas State to two overtimes before falling 101–96. Jordan Crawford hit a three-pointer with seconds remaining in the first overtime period to force a second.\nTournament procedure.\nA total of 65 teams were selected for the tournament. Thirty one of the teams earned automatic bids by winning their conference tournaments. The automatic bid of the Ivy League, which does not conduct a postseason tournament, went to Cornell, its regular season champion. The remaining 34 teams were granted at-large bids, which were extended by the NCAA Selection Committee.\nTwo teams played an opening-round game, popularly called the play-in game; the winner of that game advanced to the main draw of the tournament and played a top seed in one of the regionals. The 2010 game was played on March 16 at University of Dayton Arena in Dayton, Ohio, as it has been since its inception in 2001.\nAll 64 teams were seeded 1 to 16 within their regions; the winner of the play-in game automatically received a 16 seed. The Selection Committee seeded the entire field from 1 to 65. UCLA athletic director Dan Guerrero took over as chair of the Division I Men's Basketball Committee.\nDefending champion North Carolina did not qualify for the Tournament, while two schools made their first post-season appearance: Southern Conference champion Wofford and SWAC champion Arkansas-Pine Bluff. Conference USA champion Houston made its first NCAA Tournament appearance in 18 years.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following are the sites that were selected to host each round of the 2010 tournament:\nOpening Round\nFirst and Second Rounds\nRegional semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nIndianapolis hosted the Final Four for the 6th time, having previously hosted in 2006, and was also the first to be held at the stadium; the RCA Dome and Market Square Arena hosted past Final Fours when the event was held in Indianapolis.\nQualifying teams.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2010 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nBracket.\nResults to date\nAll times in U.S. EDT.\nOpening Round Game – Dayton, Ohio.\nWinner advanced as 16th seed in South Regional vs. (1) Duke.\nGame summaries.\nMidwest Region.\nFirst round.\nThe biggest upset of the first day came in Providence, Rhode Island, where 14th-seeded Ohio defeated third-seeded Georgetown in convincing fashion, 97–83, for their first Tournament win since 1983, when they ousted Illinois State in the first round of that Tournament. Armon Bassett scored 32 points for the Bobcats, who shot 57 percent from the field and made 13 of 23 3-pointers. They advanced to face Tennessee, the sixth seed in the region. The Volunteers held off 11th seed San Diego State, 62–59, on head coach Bruce Pearl's 50th birthday. J. P. Prince and Melvin Goins scored 15 points each for Tennessee.\nIn Oklahoma City, Ali Farokhmanesh drilled a three-pointer with 4.9 seconds remaining to lift ninth-seeded Northern Iowa over UNLV. It was the Panthers first Tournament win since 1990. UNI advanced to face top-seeded Kansas. The top seed withheld an effort by Lehigh, trailing the 16th seed early in the game and leading by just six at halftime before pulling away midway in the second half for a 90–74 win.\nOn the second day of play, 10th-seeded Georgia Tech failed to make a single field goal in the final 8:19 of play, but sank 13 free throws to hold off No. 7 Oklahoma State, 64–59, in Milwaukee. Gani Lawal led Georgia Tech with 14 points. The Yellow Jackets advanced to play Ohio State, who defeated UC Santa Barbara 68–51. Buckeye star Evan Turner struggled from the field, shooting 2–13 and scoring nine points, and the Gauchos put up a fight playing from behind most of the game.\nRounding out the Midwest bracket were Maryland and Michigan State in Spokane, Washington. The Terrapins beat Houston 89–77 behind a career-high 21 points and 17 rebounds from freshman Jordan Williams, while the Spartans edged New Mexico State, 70–67. The end of the game included a controversial lane violation call on Aggies player Troy Gillenwater with 18.6 seconds left that allowed MSU to reshoot a missed free throw and extend its lead to 3.\nSecond round.\nNorthern Iowa stunned the nation by knocking off top overall seed Kansas, 69–67. Leading by just one in the final minute of play, Ali Farokhmanesh clinched the victory for the second time in as many games with a three-point basket that ESPN's Pat Forde called \"the greatest early-round shot in NCAA tournament history.\" The win was significant for several reasons: it marked the Panthers' first trip ever to the Sweet Sixteen, and was the first time in six years a No. 1 seed was eliminated in the round of 32. It was also the first time since 1962 that a team from the Missouri Valley Conference had defeated a top seed in the Tournament. Meanwhile, Michigan State lost guard Kalin Lucas to a leg injury late in the first half of its game with Maryland. Michigan State extended its halftime lead of NINE to 16 in the second half before falling behind by one late after succumbing to Maryland's relentless pressure defense and some spectacular plays by Greivis Vásquez. But Korie Lucious kept MSU from losing the game, hitting a 3-pointer as time ran out to lift his team past the Terrapins, 85–83. Lucas' injury proved to be a torn Achilles tendon, putting the junior out of action for up to six months.\nFor the third time in four years, Tennessee made it to the regional semifinals with their 83–68 win over Ohio. J. P. Prince scored 18 points for the Volunteers, while Scotty Hopson added 17. In Milwaukee, Ohio State's Evan Turner bounced back from his off-night in the first round, nearly recording a triple-double (24 points, 9 rebounds and 9 assists) as the Buckeyes downed Georgia Tech 75–66.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nMichigan State's Durrell Summers, after scoring 80 points on 54 field goal attempts, was named the region's Most Outstanding Player.\nWest Region.\nFirst round.\nFor the second time in three years, the Vanderbilt Commodores were victims of the upset, losing to Murray State on a Danero Thomas shot with time expiring, 66–65, in San Jose, California. Like 2008, when they lost to Siena, Vandy was seeded fourth against the Racers. Murray State advanced to face fifth-seeded Butler, who defeated UTEP, 77–59, after trailing 33–27 at the half. Shelvin Mack led the Bulldogs with 25 points.\nMeanwhile, the Florida Gators rallied from a 13-point deficit in Oklahoma City to send their game with BYU to two overtimes. But Florida player Chandler Parsons missed chances to win the game at the end of regulation and the first overtime, and BYU's Jimmer Fredette sealed the 99–92 win with a pair of threes in the second overtime. Fredette finished with 37 points, the eighth time that year he'd scored over 30. BYU's advanced to play Kansas State, who had little trouble with the North Texas Mean Green, winning 82–62.\nFive years after Vermont upset Syracuse, the two teams met again in the Big Dance, this time in Buffalo, New York. Unlike the 2005 game, however, Syracuse was able to shut down the Catamounts, winning 79–56. Five players scored in double digits for the Orange. They advanced to play Gonzaga. The Bulldogs had an 18-point led against Florida State, but the Seminoles cut it to five with 2:21 remaining. The Zags survived FSU's comeback, however, by making 8 of 10 free throws down the stretch to seal a 67–60 win.\nThe last two slots in the West went to Pittsburgh and Xavier. It was a close game between Pittsburgh and Oakland in Milwaukee until Grizzlies forward Derick Nelson received an elbow from Gary McGhee of the Panthers, opening a cut over his left eye that began spurting blood. Immediately after Nelson's departure, Pitt went on a 19–2 run. The Panthers held Oakland to 33 percent in their 89–66 victory. As for Xavier, they beat Minnesota, 65–54. Jordan Crawford, the Xavier player who made national headlines the previous summer when he dunked on LeBron James during a training camp held by the Cleveland Cavaliers superstar, scored 28 points for the Musketeers, 17 of those came in the second half.\nSecond round.\nMurray State had another chance at an upset against Butler, but a 3-point play by Bulldog Ronald Nored dashed those hopes, along with Gordon Hayward deflecting a Racers pass. Butler won 54–52. The Bulldogs' next opponent, top-seeded Syracuse, rolled over Gonzaga, 87–65, with Wes Johnson scoring a career best 31 points and pulling 14 rebounds.\n2 seed Kansas State fell behind to BYU early, trailing 10–0 to start the game. But the Wildcats would pull ahead with 4:21 to go in the first half and never relinquished the lead after that, advancing to the next round with an 84–72 win. K-State's Jacob Pullen had a career-high 34 points. And third-seeded Pitt was eliminated by Xavier, 71–68. Jordan Crawford had 27 points for the Musketeers.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nIn what Gregg Doyel of CBSSports.com called \"one of the best games in the history of the Sweet 16\", Kansas State downed Xavier, 101–96, in double overtime in Salt Lake City. The Musketeers' Terrell Holloway made three free throws with 5 seconds remaining in regulation to pull Xavier even with the Wildcats. Down 3 again with the first overtime winding down, Jordan Crawford nailed a 35-foot shot to extend the game further. Jacob Pullen then hit a pair of threes in the second overtime to push K-State over the top.\nSyracuse became the second number-one seed to fall, as Butler claimed its first-ever trip to the Elite Eight. The 63–59 win brought the Bulldogs within one win of playing the Final Four in their home city. Trailing by four with 5:23 left, Butler held the Orange scoreless for nearly five minutes, while scoring 11 points of their own, including a 3-point shot by Willie Veasley that bounced high off the rim before hitting the backboard and eventually falling through the net. The win marked Butler's 23rd in a row.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nThe West All-Regional team was made of regional MVP Gordon Hayward and Shelvin Mack of Butler, Denis Clemente and Jacob Pullen of Kansas State, and Jordan Crawford of Xavier.\nEast Region.\nFirst round.\nIn New Orleans, Ishmael Smith scored a 17-foot jumper with 1.3 seconds left in overtime as Wake Forest defeated Texas, 81–80. The Longhorns, who had been ranked number one as recently as January, but fell to an 8 seed in the tournament, twice trailed by double digits before rallying, then held an eight-point lead before falling. Wake Forest advanced to face top-seeded Kentucky, who breezed past East Tennessee State, 100–71.\nA basket by Quincy Pondexter with 1.7 seconds remaining helped the Washington Huskies past Marquette, 80–78, in San Jose. Washington had trailed by 15 with over 13 minutes to go in the second half. The Huskies advanced to face New Mexico, who beat the Montana Grizzlies, 62–57. Roman Martinez scored 19 points for the Lobos, while Darington Hobson had 11 points, 11 rebounds and six assists despite playing with a sprained left wrist.\nIvy League champion Cornell joined the parade of double-digit seeds advancing to the second round with a dominating performance over Temple, 78–65, in Jacksonville, Florida. Louis Dale, Ryan Wittman and Jeff Foote, all seniors for the Big Red, scored 21, 20 and 16 points respectively, and Cornell shot 56 percent from the field overall, making 8 of their first 10 shots and shooting 68 percent in the first half. It was the first tournament win in Big Red history. The Wisconsin Badgers, who Cornell drew next, managed to avoid getting upset itself, beating Wofford in a low-scoring affair, 53–49. A pair of free throws from Jon Leuer with 4.2 seconds on the clock sealed the win for Badgers. Leuer had 20 points on the day.\nOne year after reaching the Elite Eight, 10th-seeded Missouri knocked off No. 7 Clemson, 86–78, in Buffalo. The Missouri Tigers' defense forced 20 turnovers and stole the ball 15 times in the win, while Kim English and Keith Ramsey had 20 points each offensively. Mizzou advanced to play West Virginia, who started its opening round game trailing Morgan State, 12–3. But the 2 seed hit 8 of its next 11 shots to take the lead for good en route to a 77–50 win.\nSecond round.\nWashington looked nothing like the No. 11 seed in the East, dismantling third-seeded New Mexico, 82–64. With 18 points from Quincy Pondexter and 15 from Isaiah Thomas and Matthew Bryan-Amaning each, the Huskies played their uptempo style to a 12-point lead at halftime that grew to 23 midway through the second half. Washington made the Sweet 16 for the third time since 2005. West Virginia reached the Sweet 16 after beating Missouri, 68–59. Da'Sean Butler had 28 points for the Mountaineers, while the Tigers were plagued by poor shooting from the field and at the line.\nIt was another blowout for the Kentucky Wildcats as they beat Wake Forest, 90–60. Four players scored in double figures for UK as they built an early cushion, then padded it to 31 points by the second half. The Wildcats became the next hurdle in Cornell's Cinderella season, which continued with an 87–69 pasting of No. 4 Wisconsin. Thanks to 26 points from Louis Dale, another 24 from Ryan Wittman, and a 61 percent shooting effort overall—the highest percentage ever allowed by the Badgers in Bo Ryan's nine-year tenure in Madison—the Big Red became the first team from the Ivy League to reach the round of 16 in more than 30 years.\nRegional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen).\nThe clock struck midnight for 12 seed Cornell and 11 seed Washington. Kentucky put an end to the Big Red's Cinderella run with a 62–45 win in Syracuse, New York. The game started promising for Cornell, as they took a 10–2 lead to the delight of the partisan-Big Red crowd. But a talented Wildcats squad spoiled the party after that with 16 points from DeMarcus Cousins, 12 rebounds from Patrick Patterson and 8 assists from John Wall. West Virginia's 69–56 defeat of the Huskies set up the only 1 vs. 2 regional final in the tournament. The Mountaineers' Da'Sean Butler led all scorers with 18 points, as West Virginia recorded its 30th win, the most in school history.\nSouth Region.\nFirst round.\nSecond-seeded Villanova survived a scare in Providence, needing overtime to beat Robert Morris, 73–70. Scottie Reynolds was kept from the starting lineup for undisclosed reasons (Coach Jay Wright said he wanted to make a \"teaching point\"), and even though he scored 20 points, he only made 2 of 15 shots from the field. Mezie Nwigwe had a chance to send the game to a second overtime for the Colonials, but missed a 3-pointer as time ran out. Villanova plays Saint Mary's of California in the second round. The Gaels beat Richmond, 80–71, advancing for the first time in over 50 years.\nContributing to the Big East Conference's woes on day one of the tournament was Notre Dame's 51–50 loss to Old Dominion in New Orleans. The Fighting Irish opened the second half with a 30–22 lead before the Monarchs went on a 9–0 run to take the lead. The game remained close until the end, when Notre Dame's Carleton Scott attempted a 3-point basket that ended up rattling around the rim before falling out. A putback from Luke Harangody at the buzzer was not enough for the Irish. Old Dominion advanced to face Baylor in the round of 32. In a close game with Sam Houston State, the Bears used an 8–0 run in the final minutes to take the 68–59 victory.\nArkansas-Pine Bluff won the play-in game on March 16, 2010, by beating Winthrop, 61–44. But they proved to be no match for the No. 1-seed Duke Blue Devils, who blew the Golden Lions out, 73–44, in Jacksonville. Kyle Singler had 22 points and 10 rebounds for Duke, who led 39–20 at the break. Duke advanced to face California in the second round. The Golden Bears rode a rollercoaster with Louisville, leading the Cardinals by 18 before having their lead cut to 6, then pulling back out to a 14-point advantage before Louisville brought it back to within 4. But Cal ended the game with a 15–4 run to win, 77–62.\nFinally, in Spokane, the fourth-seeded Purdue Boilermakers had a go of it with upset specialist Siena, trailing the Saints 32–29 at halftime before racing to a 14-point lead to open the second half. Siena would pull within 3 with just over a minute remaining, but Purdue held on for the 72–64 win, spoiling the predictions of some fans and even President Barack Obama that Siena would make the Boilers their latest victim. They advanced to play Texas A&amp;M, who defeated Utah State, 69–53, behind 19 points from freshman Khris Middleton.\nSecond round.\nAfter barely beating Robert Morris in the first round, Villanova could not withstand the Gael storm from St. Mary's. Omar Samhan scored 32 points and grabbed seven rebounds as the No. 10 seed took down Nova, 75–68. Afterwards, Samhan called the game his \"best win ever.\" Wildcat Scottie Reynolds remained in his funk to end the season, netting just 8 points. Trailing by as many as 14 in the first half and 38–28 at halftime, Old Dominion went on a 9–0 run against Baylor at the start of the second half, then took the lead, 49–47, on free throws from Kent Bazemore. But Baylor would close the door on the upset bid with an 8–1 run to end the game, winning 76–68. The Bears' LaceDarius Dunn led all scorers with 26 points, while 7-foot center Josh Lomers had eight rebounds to go with his career high 14 points.\nChris Kramer's layup with 4.2 seconds left in overtime gave Purdue a 63–61 win over Texas A&amp;M. Kramer finished with 17 points as the Boilermakers came back from a 7-point deficit at halftime. They advanced to face Duke in the Sweet 16. The Blue Devils beat California, 68–53, behind 20 points from Nolan Smith, 17 points from Kyle Singler and 14 points and 13 rebounds from Brian Zoubek. This was the 19th time under head coach Mike Krzyzewski Duke reached the round of 16.\nRegional final (Elite Eight).\nDuke defeated Baylor 78–71, in front of a practically home crowd for Baylor in Houston, Texas. Nolan Smith was named game MVP with 29 points, while Lance Thomas also had a career high 8 offensive rebounds.\nFinal four.\nOn April 3, 2010, Butler Bulldogs, playing in their hometown, faced off against the Michigan State Spartans. In a tough, physical game, the Bulldogs, despite going more than 11 minutes without a field goal, were able to hang on after forcing Michigan State into 16 turnovers and holding the Spartans to zero fast-break points. The Bulldogs also out-rebounded Michigan State on the offensive glass, 11 to 8. With the victory, Butler became the fourth team in NCAA tournament history to hold its first five opponents under 60 points.\nOn April 3, 2010, Duke, the #1 seed from the South and West Virginia Mountaineers, the #2 seed from the East, squared off in the second of the Final Four games. Duke showed its full potential in the game, hitting 52.7 percent of its shots (and 52 percent of its three-pointers) while shredding West Virginia's 1-3-1 zone trap. Duke led 39–31 at the half and maintained its red-hot shooting in the second half. The highlight of the game came when Nolan Smith missed a contested, fast-break layup, but Kyle Singler and Miles Plumlee combined to slam home the rebound to give Duke a 14-point lead. Plumlee was credited with the dunk. Kyle Singler scored 21 points for the Blue Devils and Nolan Smith added 19 points and six assists. With the victory, Duke advanced to its 10th NCAA Championship game.\nNational championship.\nOn April 5, 2010, Butler and Duke faced off in what \"The New York Times\" called \"the most eagerly awaited championship game in years\".\nButler became the first team to play in the championship game in its home city since UCLA in 1968.\nDuke jumped out to a quick 6–1 lead to start the game, but Butler rallied back, taking a 12–11 lead at the 12:28 mark of the first half. At the under eight-minute TV timeout, Butler held a 20–18 lead. After the timeout, Duke went on an 8–0 run to take a 26–20 lead. Butler coach Brad Stevens then called a timeout. With starters Matt Howard and Ronald Nored on the bench in foul trouble, backup center Avery Jukes came up big for Butler. Jukes hit two three-pointers and a made tip-in en route to 10 first half points, tying his single-game season high. At half time, Duke's lead stood at 33–32.\nThe second half was played very closely, with neither team taking a lead larger than two points until a Brian Zoubek layup put Duke up 47–43 with 12:27 remaining. Butler stayed close, keeping within 5 points the rest of the way. With 3:16 to play, Duke took a 60–55 lead on two made free throws by Nolan Smith. Butler missed its next shot, but forced a missed shot and turned Duke over after an offensive rebound. Matt Howard made a layup for Butler to make it a 60–57 game with 1:44 remaining. Smith missed a layup for Duke and Howard got another layup after collecting an offensive rebound on a missed three-pointer by Shelvin Mack. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski then called a time out. Kyle Singler missed an open jump shot with 36 seconds remaining, giving Butler a chance to take the lead. Butler was unable to initiate their offense and Stevens called a timeout to set up a play. They were then forced to call their last timeout when they were unable to get the ball in-bounds. Gordon Hayward then missed a short fade-away jumper. Zoubek came down with the rebound, forcing Butler to foul with 3.6 seconds remaining. Zoubek made the first foul shot and then intentionally missed the second, knowing Butler had no timeouts remaining. Hayward was forced to throw up a desperation shot from half court. The ball bounced off the backboard and then the rim. According to analysis by ESPN, Hayward's aim was off by three inches, or less than one degree, on the x-axis. Because a made three-point shot would have resulted in a loss for Duke, some pundits criticized Krzyzewski for his decision to have Zoubek miss the second free throw intentionally. Other pundits, however, ran various analyses that indicated that it was statistically the correct call.\nThe 61–59 victory earned Krzyzewski his fourth national championship crown, his second in ten years. The game was the most watched finale in more than 10 years, pulling in average of viewers in the United States. Kyle Singler earned Most Outstanding Player honors with 19 points and eight rebounds.\nRecord by conference.\nThe columns R32, S16, E8, F4, and CG respectively stand for the Round of 32, Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, and championship Game. The number in each field represents an appearance in that round by a team from that conference.\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nFor the 29th consecutive year, CBS Sports again televised a majority of the event, with the exception of the opening round game, which was televised by ESPN, and first-round games played in the late afternoon, which CBS College Sports Network aired so CBS affiliates could break for local and network news. The championship game scored a Nielsen rating of 16.0.\nIn addition to the main CBS affiliates, many stations opened digital subchannels for additional coverage. Also, on these four occasions, CBS opened the coverage to additional channels to settle conflicts:\nWSPA and WYCW are in a duopoly owned by Media General, and KTVT and KTXA are in a duopoly owned by CBS Corporation.\nRadio.\nWestwood One again broadcast the tournament.\nFinal four.\nJohn Tautges again served as host of the broadcasts.\nInternational broadcasters.\nBroadcasters used the CBS feed unless stated otherwise."

        "title": "2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament",
        "text": "The 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament involved 68 teams playing in a single-elimination tournament that determined the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball national champion for the 2010-11 season. The 73rd edition of the NCAA tournament began on March 15, 2011, and concluded with the championship game on April 4, at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas. This tournament marked the introduction of the \"First Four\" round and an expansion of the field of participants from 65 teams to 68. Due to the geographical location of New Orleans and San Antonio, the \"South\" and \"Midwest\" regional games were replaced by the monikers \"Southeast\" and \"Southwest\" for this tournament, respectively.\nThe Final Four featured no top seeds for the first time since 2006, with the highest remaining seed being West Region winner, #3 Connecticut. For the first time since 2000, a #8 seed advanced to the Final Four as Butler, the national runner-up from the year before, won the Southeast Region. For only the third time ever, a #11 seed advanced to the Final Four as Virginia Commonwealth, one of the \"First Four\" teams, won the Southwest Region. Those three teams were joined by East Region champion Kentucky, a #4 seed. This was also the first Final Four to not feature any 1-seed or 2-seeds. The Final Four had the highest combined Final Four seeds since seeding started in 1979, with 26 (11-VCU, 8-Butler, 4-Kentucky &amp; 3-Connecticut). Connecticut defeated Butler in the championship game 53–41, winning its third national championship as in many attempts.\nUpsets ruled the 2011 tournament. The East Region saw its #11 seed, Marquette, advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they were downed by North Carolina. The Southwest Region saw four of its double digit seeds win, as VCU was joined by #12 seed and citymate Richmond, #10 seed Florida State, and #13 seed Morehead State as first round winners. Florida State, VCU, and Richmond all advanced to the Sweet Sixteen from that region, and VCU defeated top-seeded Kansas in the final. Butler and #11 seed Gonzaga advanced from the Southeast Region, with Gonzaga losing in the Round of 32 to BYU.\nFor the third time in as many appearances, Vanderbilt suffered a defeat to a double digit seed. This time, they were defeated by Richmond as a #5 seed.\nThe Big East had a record eleven make the tournament (the conference then had 16 total teams). Due to having more than eight teams qualify, it was possible for intra-Big East matchups to occur in the third round. Two of these matchups did occur as Marquette defeated Syracuse in the East while Connecticut defeated Cincinnati in the West. The other Big East teams to qualify were Pittsburgh, who earned the #1 seed in the Southeast Region and were knocked out in the third round by Butler, St. John's, who were the Southeast's #6 seed and were eliminated in their first game by Gonzaga, Louisville, which earned the #4 seed in the Southwest and fell to Morehead State in their first game, Georgetown, who lost to VCU in the first round as a #6 in the Southwest, Notre Dame, the #2 seed in the Southwest who were eliminated by Florida State, Villanova, who were eliminated in an #8 vs #9 matchup against George Mason in the East Region, and West Virginia, the East's #5 seed who lost in the third round to Kentucky.\nThis was the last NCAA tournament until 2023 in which a mid-major conference saw multiple teams reach the Sweet 16, as both BYU and San Diego State did from the Mountain West Conference.\nNorthern Colorado, winners of the Big Sky Conference, made its first NCAA Division I tournament.\nTournament procedure.\nFor the first time, a total of 68 teams entered the tournament. Thirty of the thirty-one automatic bids were given to the programs that won their conference tournaments, while the remaining automatic bid went to the Ivy League champion Princeton, as the conference does not hold a tournament. The remaining 37 teams were granted \"at-large\" bids, which are extended by the NCAA Selection Committee. All 68 teams were announced on \"Selection Sunday\" March 13, 2011.\nThe Selection Committee ranked the entire field from 1 to 68. The last four at-large teams selected and the four lowest ranked automatic qualifiers played in a \"First Four\". The four winners of those games advanced to the main draw of the tournament to play a higher seed. The four lowest ranked teams of the 68 played against each other in a pair of First Four games, with winners advancing to play No. 1 seeds, and the last four at-large teams played in the other two First Four games, with the winners moving on to face the seed they would otherwise be matched up against, as determined by their seed number.\nSchedule and venues.\nThe following sites were selected to host each round of the 2011 tournament:\nFirst Four\nFirst and Second rounds\nRegional semifinals and Finals (Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight)\nNational semifinals and championship (Final Four and championship)\nQualified teams.\nAutomatic bids.\nThe following teams were automatic qualifiers for the 2011 NCAA field by virtue of winning their conference's tournament (except for the Ivy League, whose regular-season champion received the automatic bid).\nBracket.\n\"Unless otherwise noted, all times listed are Eastern \"Daylight\" Time ()\"\nFirst Four – Dayton, Ohio.\nThe First Four games involved eight teams: the four overall lowest-ranked teams, and the four lowest-ranked at-large teams.\nAll games on truTV. First Four winners enter the second round as their respective seed and in their respective region.\nGame summaries.\nConsisting of #3-seeded Connecticut, No. 4 Kentucky, No. 8 Butler, and No. 11 Virginia Commonwealth (VCU), It was the first time in the tournament's history that a No. 1 or a No. 2 seed had failed to reach the final four and it would not happen again until 2023, coincidentally, also in Houston. 11th seeded VCU tied a record as the lowest seed to reach the final four. By virtue of their \"first four\" appearance, VCU became the first team to reach the final four by winning five tournament games.\nThe first semifinal featured Butler and VCU, with Butler winning 70–62, despite VCU forward Jamie Skeen leading the scoring with 27 points.\nThe second semifinal match was between Kentucky and Connecticut. Connecticut had already defeated Kentucky earlier that season 84–67 at the Maui Invitational. This time, Connecticut won in a close game 56–55, led by Kemba Walker with 18 points. Connecticut were noted for their defensive effort, which held Kentucky to 34% shooting and also held Kentucky scoreless for over 5 minutes during a spell in the second half.\nNational Championship.\nThe National Championship game was between Butler, a mid-major university team that was a surprise finalist in the 2010 tournament, and Connecticut, a basketball powerhouse which had previously won the tournament twice under coach Jim Calhoun but had an average regular season finishing 9th in the Big East Conference before winning The Big East tournament with five wins in five consecutive days (never before accomplished in NCAA history). The championship game was won by Connecticut 53–41. It was a very defensive contest, with Butler having the fewest points in a championship game since 1949. Butler led at halftime 22–19, but suffered in the second half from poor shooting, making only 6 of 37 shots in the second half. Butler's 18.8 percent shooting for the entire game was the lowest ever in the NCAA final. Connecticut contributed to Butler's poor shooting by blocking 10 shots (a championship game record). Butler was led in scoring by junior guard Shelvin Mack with 13 points, while UConn freshman Jeremy Lamb scored 12 points in the 2nd half.\nThe win by Connecticut completed a season-ending 11-game win streak that began with the Big East tournament.\nThe game was widely viewed as a poor quality final. In reference to the game's first half of play, CBS analyst Greg Anthony said, \"This is the worst half of basketball I've ever seen in a national championship game.\"\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nOn April 22, 2010, it was announced that the NCAA had reached a new 14-year, US$10.8 billion deal with CBS Sports and Time Warner-owned Turner Sports (by way of TBS, TNT and truTV) for the rights to broadcast the NCAA tournament from 2011 until 2024 (later extended to 2032 in the 2016 tournament), marking the first time every game in the tournament would be telecast on a national basis.\nCBS and Turner pooled their resources for the tournament, with members of the \"NBA on TNT\" crew joining CBS's established March Madness broadcasters. Coverage will originate from the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and Turner's Atlanta studios.&lt;ref name=\"CBS/Turner talent\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe tournament television ratings report shows the tournament had an average of 10.2 million viewers per game, an increase from the 2005 tournament when it drew an average of 10.6 million (6.4 Nielsen rating). The championship game recorded an 11.7 rating and drew 20.1 million viewers.\nTruTV, which up to that point had never aired any live sports programming, saw a surge in carriage deals for its high definition feed with several major providers including AT&amp;T U-verse, Verizon FiOS, Comcast, Charter Communications, Cablevision, Cox Cable and RCN.\nRound-by-round game schedule.\n\"All times Eastern and PM\"\nCBS received the same number of \"windows\", or time slots, for its tournament coverage as in previous years. However, all games will now be nationally rather than regionally televised. The national television broadcasts also allowed for more flexibility in start times. CBS and the Turner networks used the same graphics package and theme music in broadcasting the tournament the only difference between networks is the logo shown on the score bug. In addition, a banner at the top of the screen displayed the scores of other games along with what network they are being broadcast on. Replays feature all four network logos being shown, and for fair use highlight credits by local television stations and other networks such as ESPN, the Turner network name or CBS Sports, followed by \"NCAA\" is given as the source. CBS also kept coverage of the Division II final, which is part of the larger contract for this tournament.\nTurner Sports aired full-length studio shows before and after each session of play. The pregame show was called \"Infiniti NCAA Tip-Off\" and all shows were on TruTV. The postgame show, called \"Inside March Madness presented by Buick\", alternated between TruTV and TBS.\nTruTV had also added coverage of the Reese's College All-Star Game.\nRadio.\nWestwood One had live broadcasts of all 67 games. They will be available both on terrestrial and satellite radio outlets, on NCAA.com, and on CBSSports.com. The radio contract was extended in January 2011 for multiple tournaments.\nInternet/other video.\nAll games are expected to be streamed at NCAA.com or CBSSports.com, as in the past; with the new rights deal, NCAA.com and the game streaming is now managed by Turner Interactive. The iPhone app which allowed streaming of games on the iPhone in previous years, and had cost about ten dollars, has received two upgrades: it is compatible with iPad, and it is now free of charge. However, with the CBS-Turner agreement allowing all games in the tournament to be available on a national basis (see above), Mega March Madness, a DirecTV-only service, has been discontinued."

        "title": "Rope solo climbing",
        "text": "Rope-solo climbing or rope-soloing (or self-belaying) is a form of solo climbing (i.e. performed alone without a climbing partner), but unlike with free solo climbing, which is also performed alone and with no climbing protection whatsoever, the rope-solo climber uses a mechanical self-belay device and rope system, which enables them to use the standard climbing protection to protect themselves in the event of a fall. \nRope-soloing can be performed as free climbing in a traditional climbing or a sport climbing format. It can also be performed as aid climbing, and a modified version can be performed as top rope soloing. Due to the complexity of the self-belay system, and the greater workloads, it is still considered a hazardous technique.\nVersions of rope-solo climbing have been used by solo alpine climbers, including by French alpinist Catherine Destivelle, and Italian alpinist Walter Bonatti. Rope-solo climbing techniques have also been used on big wall climbing routes by climbers such as German Alexander Huber and British climber Pete Whittaker.\nDescription.\nIn rope-soloing, the climber acts as if they are lead climbing, but instead of having a partner (or belayer) who can arrest the rope in the event of a fall, the climber instead uses a self-belay device and rope system that automatically stops the rope in the event of a fall. In a normal lead climbing system, the lead climber ties into one end of the rope while their second clips-into the rope via their belay device. In rope-solo climbing, this is reversed. Instead, the rope-solo climber ties one end of the rope into a secure anchor at the base of the climb (that can withstand upward forces), and they clip-into the rope via their self-belay device. \nAs the rope-solo climber ascends, the rope pays through the self-belay device. The rope-solo climber will then clip-into either traditional, sport, or aid climbing protection as they ascend — like a normal lead climber. When the rope-solo climber reaches the top of the route, they then have to fix another anchor, abseil back down to the base of the climb and release the original anchor, and then re-ascend the fixed abseil rope — using ascenders — unclipping/taking out whatever climbing protection equipment they inserted on their earlier ascent. Thus the rope-solo climber has to do significantly more work than a normal lead climber with a climbing partner.\nEquipment.\nSelf-belay device.\nThe most important piece of equipment is the self-belay device, which the climber wears near their chest/harness, which will allow the rope to pass through it as the climber is ascending, but will grip the rope tightly if it suddenly changes direction in the event of a fall. Rope-solo climbers have used various types of self-belay devices, some modified from their original purpose, including Grigris, Revos, and Silent Partners.\nRope-solo system.\nThe self-belay device is only one part of a complex system designed to ensure that the rope feeds through the self-belay device properly (in both directions) and that the base anchor can handle a wide range of forces. Some of the self-belay devices also require that the climber does not invert while falling, requiring additional systems. Rope-solo climbers use a range of backup systems in case the self-belay device fails to grip and arrest the fall, which can range from making knots in the rope to employing other braking devices.\nNotable ascents and practitioners.\nMany notable solo ascents by alpinists involved modified/customized versions of rope-solo climbing, including Walter Bonatti's \"Z system\" self-belay that he employed in making his first solo ascent of the south-east pillar of the Aiguille du Dru, known as the \"Bonatti Route\".\nOther notable rope-solo ascents by rope-solo practitioners include:"

        "text": "Jason Ryan Holland (born April 30, 1976) is a Canadian-German former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played 81 games in the National Hockey League and spent the last seven years of his playing career in Germany.\nPlaying career.\nHolland was drafted in the second round, 38th overall, by the New York Islanders in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft.\nAfter playing four seasons in the Western Hockey League with the Kamloops Blazers, winning the CHL Memorial Cup in 1994 and 1995, and playing for the victorious Canadian team at the 1996 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, Holland made his professional debut in the American Hockey League with the Kentucky Thoroughblades during the 1996–97 season. During the same season, he made his NHL debut with the Islanders, appearing in four games.\nDuring the 1997–98 season, Holland was traded along with Paul Kruse to the Buffalo Sabres in exchange for Jason Dawe. After three-plus seasons with the Sabres organization, mostly spent in the AHL with the Rochester Americans, Holland joined the Los Angeles Kings. Once again, most of Holland's time with the organization was spent with their AHL affiliate, in this case the Manchester Monarchs. Holland did spend the entire 2003–04 season with the Kings, appearing in 52 games and tallying six points.\nHolland spent the 2005–06 season with ERC Ingolstadt of Germany's Deutsche Eishockey Liga, and remained with the team until the end of the 2008–09 season. On April 21, 2009, he signed a contract with another German DEL side, the Düsseldorfer EG Metro Stars, spending three years with the club. He retired after the 2011–12 season.\nInternational play.\nA Canadian of German descent, Holland received a German passport in February 2007. He was chosen to play for the German national team for 2008 World Championships and he played games against Finland and Slovakia. Germany beat Slovakia 4–2, before it was found out that Holland was ineligible to play for Germany, because he had played only three seasons in Germany, while IIHF rules state that player who has represented another country (as Holland did in 1996, playing for Canada at the Junior World Championships) might change nationality after playing four seasons in the country. German victory was in jeopardy for a short time, but finally Germany was allowed to keep the points, while Holland was suspended from the tournament."

During his freshman season at Riverside, Stewart hit .361 with a .509 slugging percentage.\nProfessional career.\nChicago White Sox.\nThe Chicago White Sox selected Stewart in the 12 round of the 2001 Major League Baseball Draft. He signed with the White Sox that year on August 18. Stewart began his professional career in 2002 with the Chicago White Sox rookie-level affiliate, the Bristol White Sox of the Appalachian League.

Key measurements are \"ratings\", the percentage of all U.S. television-equipped households that watched a game, \"share\", the percentage of television sets in use that were tuned to a game, and total viewers (or \"viewership\"), the average number of people watching a game throughout its duration.\nThe highest ratings for an entire World Series is tied between , featuring the New York Yankees and Los Angeles Dodgers, and , featuring the Philadelphia Phillies and Kansas City Royals. Both series went six games and averaged a rating of 32.8 and a share of 56. Average viewership was slightly larger in 1978 (44,278,950) than in 1980 (42,300,000).\nThe lowest ratings for an entire World Series was in , a five-game series won by the Texas Rangers over the Arizona Diamondbacks, which averaged a 4.7 rating with a 14 share; it also had the lowest average viewership, at 9.082 million. Previously, the series in which the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays in six games was the least watched, averaging a 5.2 rating and a 12 share.\nThe highest-rated individual game in World Series history was Game 6 in , when the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Kansas City Royals; the game had a 40.0 rating. The only other games with a rating of 39 or higher were Game 7 in , when the Cincinnati Reds defeated the Boston Red Sox, with a 39.6 rating, and Game 4 in , when the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the New York Yankees, with a 39.5 rating. The most-viewed game was Game 7 in , when the New York Mets defeated the Boston Red Sox; with a rating of 38.9, its viewership is estimated at 55 to 60 million.\nThe lowest-rated individual game was Game 2 in , which had a 4.0 rating. Though the game did not have the smallest viewership in World Series history, that mark belongs to Game 3 in at 8.126 million. That game had a 4.2 rating.

        "title": "Rugby union in Uruguay",
        "text": "Rugby union in Uruguay is considered a popular sport. The Uruguay national team, commonly known as \"Los Teros\", have been playing international rugby since the late 1940s and have made appearances in five Rugby World Cups: 1999, 2003, 2015, 2019 and 2023.\nRugby union is a popular recreational sport in Uruguay. Rugby union is considered the third most popular sport, behind association football (soccer) and basketball. The popularity of rugby union took off after the national side qualified for the 1999 Rugby World Cup and the subsequent 2003 World Cup, this saw a renewed interest in the sport and broad media coverage of the game.\nGoverning body.\nThe Unión de Rugby del Uruguay is the governing body for rugby union in Uruguay. The organisation was founded in 1951 and became an official affiliate of the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 1989. It is also a member of CONSUR.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThere is some argument as to who introduced the sport to the country. The British Schools of Montevideo claim that they were the first to play the game in the country. However, the \"growth\" of rugby in Uruguay can be attributed largely to the schools of the Christian Brothers which introduced the game from Ireland in the early twentieth century. Their schools tended to play rugby union, whereas those of the Jesuits played football.\nRugby was being played in neighbouring Argentina and Brazil in the late nineteenth century, mainly by British immigrants, and there is some evidence of this within Uruguay itself. English cricket clubs were the incubators of rugby in South America, although rugby has survived much better in these countries than cricket has. It has been claimed that Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC) played rugby football as early as 1865, but the first certain match was between Uruguayans and British members of the MVCC in 1880. The MVCC claims to be the oldest rugby club outside Europe. One observer, apparently disdainful of the Britons mixing with the \"natives\", found the 1880 match to be:\nPost-War period.\nAfter the Second World War, there was something of a revival, thanks largely to Carlos E. Cat, who had played for San Isidro (CASI) in the 1920s. \nUruguay's rugby union international debut came in 1948, where they played a friendly match against Chile, which they eventually lost 21–3.\nIn 1949, \"rugby criollo\" was introduced into the Carrasco Polo Club, which not unlike the MVCC, would become more renowned for rugby than the sport it was named for.\nIn 1950, the Campeonato Uruguayo was held for first time, being today the main local competition. Its success led to the formation of the sports new governing body, the Uruguayan Rugby Union, in January 1951, with Carlos Cat as its first president. The first Club Championship was contested by Old Boys, Colonia Rugby, and multisport clubs such as Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC) and Carrasco Polo (which supplied two XVs).\nA second international followed in '51, against a vastly more experienced Argentina team, in the South American Championship. Again Uruguay were defeated this time 62–0. Uruguay, however did beat Chile in this championship. Following these matches Uruguay did not have a solid international calendar, so their next international match would be five years later, against Chile.\nOne consequence was that Argentina's governing body could no longer call itself the \"River Plate Rugby Union\", as Uruguay occupied the east bank, and had to rename itself the UAR in November 1951.\n1970s onwards.\nThe 1970s saw a much better period for rugby union in Uruguay in comparison to previous decades with an increase in player numbers. The national team started off with a win over Paraguay in 1971, which was followed by a win and loss against Chile and a win against Brazil. They were beaten by Argentina by 55 points on two occasions in the early 1970s. However, except for these two against Argentina, they won all their matches. This led to a huge rise in the game's profile in Uruguay.\nCarrasco Polo was transformed by the coaching of Amarillo Washington, who used scientific methods to replace the earlier habits of \"training hard, but then after matches going to the bar to eat and drink everything.\" Carrasco's leading player Diego Ormaechea had been introduced to the sport as a fifteen-year-old in 1976 and was still playing for club and country more than twenty years later.\nIn the 1980s, the Unión de Rugby del Uruguay used the success of coaching at Stella Maris and the British School as a template for spreading the game into other schools.\nThe year 1989 saw the Unión de Rugby del Uruguay, officially join the International Rugby Board (IRB) this saw increased international competition. The 1990s started off in an optimistic fashion, with three straight defeats of Chile, Brazil and Paraguay. This was followed by more wins over their traditional opponents, though Uruguay still lost to South America's powerhouse Argentina. Uruguay's biggest success was qualifying for the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. Uruguay finished third in their pool, winning one game against a weak Spanish side, which was not good enough to qualify for the knockout stages. Despite this rugby union's profile soared and is considered the third most popular sport, after football and basketball.\nIn 1993, Carrasco Polo beat a Buenos Aires squad which included 14 \"Pumas\".\nOrmaechea, aged 40 years old, was also the oldest player ever at the Rugby World Cup finals, in 1999, being the captain in his country first ever presence at the event. He scored a try in the 27–15 win over Spain. (He had been introduced to rugby as a fifteen-year-old in 1976, and played for over two decades.) In addition, Ormaechea was older than URU president, Andres Sanguinetti.\nUruguay has been visited by at least two French tours – that of 1960, and that of 1985.\nAlthough the number of clubs is relatively small, rugby enjoys great social \"kudos\" in Uruguay, with past presidents of the URU including Pedro Bordaberry, a former cabinet minister, as well as Andres Sanguinetti, the half-brother of former national president Julio María Sanguinetti. This has ensured that the game is reasonably well funded.\nOne of the best known fixtures of Uruguayan rugby is the Punta del Este Sevens, which has attracted many of the world's top sides to one of South America's swankiest beach resorts.\nFlight 571 &amp; \"Alive\".\nThe tragic crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571, and the resulting books and films, \"\" and \"Alive\" brought Uruguayan rugby into the global limelight.\n\"Alive\" tells the story of a Uruguayan Rugby team (who were alumni of Stella Maris College (Montevideo)) and their friends and family who were involved in the airplane crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 which crashed into the Andes mountains on 13 October 1972. It was published two years after survivors of the crash were rescued.\nDuring the 1999 Rugby World Cup, the national squad was reported to have been saddened by persistent press questioning about Flight 571, rather than their achievement in reaching it with such a small player base.\nNational team.\nThe national team, more commonly known as the \"Los Teros\" (southern lapwing), represent Uruguay at international level. The team is governed by the Unión de Rugby del Uruguay and are the second highest ranked team in South America after Argentina at 18th in the world. The team plays almost all of its home games at the 14,000-capacity Estadio Charrúa in Montevideo, typically drawing about 11,000 for international fixtures.\nUruguay has made a name for itself as the up-and-coming rugby nation of the Americas. Its wins of 67–3 over Paraguay and 14–6 over Chile in the qualifiers for the 1995 Rugby World Cup ensured that its place as the No. 2 nation in South American rugby was assured. In the same competition, they managed to hold Argentina, the most successful rugby nation of the Americas, to 10–19. This places Uruguay as No. 4 within the Americas a whole, despite its small population and number of players.\nWomen's rugby.\nAlthough Uruguay's women have not yet played test match rugby, they have been playing international sevens rugby since 2004.

        "title": "SummerSlam (1989)",
        "text": "The 1989 SummerSlam was the second annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 28, 1989, in the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Ten matches were contested at the event, including one dark match held before the live broadcast.\nThe main event was a tag team match between the team of WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake (who would later be known as The Mega-Maniacs in the 1990s) and the team of \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and Zeus. The main matches on the undercard were \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase versus Jimmy \"Superfly\" Snuka, The Ultimate Warrior versus Ravishing Rick Rude for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, and Jim Duggan and Demolition (Ax and Smash) versus André the Giant and The Twin Towers (Akeem and Big Boss Man).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nFollowing the success of SummerSlam 1988, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) scheduled a second SummerSlam to be held on August 28, 1989, in the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it was one of the WWF's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. This 1989 event established SummerSlam as the promotion's annual August pay-per-view (PPV).\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam pitted WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake against \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage and Zeus. At WrestleMania V in April 1989, Hogan defeated Savage to win his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship. WWF financed a professional wrestling movie \"No Holds Barred\". Hogan starred as the hero Rip, a popular professional wrestler, while Tom Lister played the villain Zeus. In the movie, Hogan defeated Zeus. The rivalry spanned in WWF, because Zeus wanted to take revenge from Hogan in real-life due to Hogan breaking Zeus's nose on set. In the WWF, he was also billed as Zeus. He made his first appearance on WWF television on the May 27, 1989, edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXI\" before Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight title defense against Big Boss Man in a steel cage match. He was introduced by Boss Man's manager Slick. During Hogan's entrance, Zeus brutally attacked him. On the July 29 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXII\", Zeus attacked Brutus Beefcake during Beefcake's match with Hogan's rival Randy Savage. Zeus did this because Beefcake was on the cusp of defeating Randy Savage. Hogan came to the rescue but was unable to drop Zeus because Savage gave him two chair shots in the back. This led to the Hogan &amp; Beefcake vs. Savage &amp; Zeus encounter at SummerSlam.\nThe main singles match on the card was between Ravishing Rick Rude versus The Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. They had a \"Super Posedown\" at the Royal Rumble in January 1989 which was won by Warrior, prompting Rude to angrily attack him with a steel workout bar. This led to their title match at WrestleMania V, where Warrior lost the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship to Rude. They were signed to a rematch for the title at SummerSlam, with Rude defending the title against Warrior.\nEvent.\nBefore the event began airing live on pay-per-view, Dino Bravo defeated Koko B. Ware in a dark match.\nThe first match of the pay-per-view was a non-title tag team match between the WWF Tag Team Champions The Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard), accompanied to the ring by Bobby Heenan, and The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). In the middle of the match, Anderson tried to interfere, causing all four men to fight in the ring. Meanwhile, Heenan had the referee distracted, which allowed Anderson to perform a double ax handle, dropping his elbow onto the back of Hart's neck as Hart covered Blanchard. Anderson then rolled Blanchard out of the ring and covered Hart. Heenan stopped distracting the referee who turned to see the pin and began the count without realizing that Anderson was not the legal man in the match. Although the Brain Busters were the reigning Tag-Team Champions going into the match, according to the storyline the match against the Harts was signed before they had won the titles and thus the belts were not on the line at SummerSlam.\nThe second match of the evening was between Dusty Rhodes and The Honky Tonk Man, who was managed by Jimmy Hart. Rhodes had the advantage until Hart distracted him. This allowed The Honky Tonk Man to grab Hart's megaphone and ram it into Rhodes' midsection. The Honky Tonk Man continued in the offensive position until Rhodes' was able to get back on his feet. The Honky Tonk Man, however, shoved Rhodes into the referee, knocking him out. This allowed The Honky Tonk Man to hold Rhodes while Hart attempted to hit Rhodes with The Honky Tonk Man's guitar. Rhodes, however, moved out of the way, and Hart hit The Honky Tonk Man instead. Rhodes then performed his finishing move, the Bionic Elbow, and pinned him for the win. After the match Sean Mooney interviewed Honky Tonk in the aisle. A still dazed Honky, thinking he was Elvis and that Jimmy Hart was \"Cilla\", asked Mooney where the stage was.\nThe third match, which pitted Mr. Perfect against The Red Rooster, began with a shoving match in the center of the ring. Mr. Perfect performed several offensive maneuvers on The Red Rooster, even preventing Rooster from reversing a slam to the mat. Mr. Perfect ended the match by performing a dropkick and the Perfect Plex and then pinning him for the win. The match was ended early due to Taylor legitimately injuring his knee. He would be sidelined afterwards for several months.\nIn the subsequent match-up, Rick Martel and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau) faced Tito Santana and The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty). In the first moments of the match, Santana and The Rockers cleared all the opposing team members from the ring. Jannetty was the legal man for his team and faced all three opponents as they tagged each other into the match. Martel and the Rougeaus kept Jannetty isolated in their corner by utilizing illegal double team moves. After some time, Santana tagged Michaels into the match, who quickly regained the advantage. Near the end of the match, Jimmy Hart, who had accompanied The Rougeaus and Martel to the ring, distracted Jannetty, who was hit from behind by Jacques. As a result, Martel was able to pin Jannetty.\nThe next match was a WWF Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the defending champion Rick Rude, who was accompanied to the ring by Bobby Heenan. Before the match a video was aired showing that in the weeks prior to SummerSlam, members of The Heenan Family including Haku and André the Giant had attempted to take the Warrior 'out' in order to help Rude keep his title. The Warrior gained the early advantage in the beginning of the contest by press slamming Rude from the ring onto the arena's floor, where he followed him and continued the assault, including hitting Rude with the IC belt. He continued to have the advantage until Rude was able to thwart an offensive maneuver by pushing The Warrior from the top rope onto the turnbuckle. The two wrestlers swapped the offensive position until Roddy Piper came down to ringside to distract Rude by flipping up his Kilt and showing Rude his bare ass (though in reality Piper was wearing a jockstrap). This allowed The Warrior to perform a German suplex, press slam, and a Warrior Splash. The Warrior then pinned Rude to become the new Intercontinental Champion. Following the match, commentator Jesse Ventura claimed that the Warrior should cut the belt in half and give the rest to Piper. Heenan and Rude also stormed into the backstage interview area and interrupted Gene Okerlund's interview with Ron Garvin. Heenan was so upset during the interview he ended up babbling.\nJim Duggan and Demolition (Smash and Ax) defeated André the Giant and The Twin Towers (Big Boss Man and Akeem) (with Bobby Heenan and Slick). Smash pinned Akeem after Duggan hit Akeem in the head with his 2×4.\nGreg Valentine (with Jimmy Hart) defeated Hercules. Valentine pinned Hercules with his feet on the ropes, something the referee failed to see. Guest ring announcer Ronnie Garvin (who was feuding with Valentine at the time) refused to announce Valentine as the winner of the match. Garvin repeatedly announced Hercules as the winner by disqualification (even though Valentine had officially won the match).\nTed DiBiase (with his bodyguard Virgil) defeated Jimmy Snuka by countout. Following the match, Snuka delivered a flying headbutt to Dibiase, knocking him out of the ring before headbutting and slamming Virgil and performing his Superfly Splash on the prone bodyguard.\nIn the main event, WWF Champion Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake faced Randy Savage and Zeus. After all of the wrestlers were introduced, Miss Elizabeth was introduced and came to the ring separately. In the beginning, Beefcake and Savage brawled on the floor and Zeus no-sold Hogan. Beefcake came out and made the save but was caught by Zeus in a bearhug. Hogan tried to save his partner but he also became victim of a bearhug by Zeus. Savage came off the top rope and hit Hogan with a diving double axe handle. He hit Hogan another double axe handle from the top rope and a running knee for a near-fall. Savage applied a chinlock on Hogan but Hogan hit Savage with shoulder blocks. He came off the ropes where Zeus assaulted him. Zeus got a tag and then he beat on Hogan and locked in a bearhug where he took Hogan to the mat for several near-falls. Zeus took him in their corner and then tagged Savage. Savage connected with a neckbreaker on Hogan and spat on Beefcake, forcing him to get into the ring. Savage hit a belly to belly suplex on Hogan for a near-fall. Hogan tagged in Beefcake who hit Savage with a high knee for a near-fall. He locked in a Barber's Chair on Savage, who fell to the knees but then got up and drove Beefcake's head in the corner. Zeus tagged in and was very angry. Beefcake hit him with an eye rake and applied a Barber's Chair on Zeus. Savage took his manager Sensational Sherri's loaded purse and hit Beefcake in the back with it. Savage got a tag, calmed down Zeus and got a near-fall on Beefcake which ended after Hogan made the save. Savage went for another cover and Hogan came in again and chased Savage, who hid behind Hogan's manager Miss Elizabeth and was beaten up by Hogan. Zeus came in and locked a chokehold on Beefcake before tagging Savage. Savage and Beefcake knocked out each other. Beefcake tagged Hogan. Hogan connected with a corner clothesline on Savage and then assaulted Zeus. He hit a big boot on Savage, sending him to the floor. Hogan tried to suplex Savage in the ring from the apron but Sherri tripped him as Savage fell on Hogan for a near-fall. He clotheslined Hogan and he hit a Savage Elbow from the top rope but like WrestleMania V, Hogan no-sold it. He beat on Savage and sent him to the floor after an atomic drop. Zeus tagged in. He beat Zeus with clotheslines. Zeus fell on one knee. Miss Elizabeth tripped Sherri and Beefcake tossed Savage on the mat. The referee was distracted. Hogan took advantage and hit Zeus with Sherri's loaded purse, followed by a scoop slam and a leg drop for the victory.\nAftermath.\nHulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake met Randy Savage and Zeus in a rematch at No Holds Barred pay-per-view contested in a steel cage where Hogan and Beefcake won again. Prior to the \"No Holds Barred\" pay-per-view rematch, Zeus began appearing in the corner of Ted DiBiase as he renewed his push for Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and Zeus was on the DiBiase-captained team facing Hogan at the 1989 Survivor Series; Hogan also began facing Savage in a series of one-on-one steel cage matches. A steel cage match was also used in the final match involving the Hogan-Beefcake vs. Savage-Zeus storyline, where the two tag teams faced each other during a special pay-per-view, , in December; there, Hogan and Beefcake defeated Savage and Zeus.\nThe Brain Busters (Arn Anderson and Tully Blanchard) defended the WWF Tag Team Championship until losing the belts back to Demolition in October 1989. The title change took place at a television taping for the WWF's syndicated \"Superstars of Wrestling\", and did not air until the weekend of November 4, 1989; until the airing of the title match on \"Superstars\", Anderson and Blanchard competed at WWF events as the champions, but were frequently not announced as such. Blanchard would be fired for failing a drug test on November 1 and Haku replaced Anderson on the bookings until Survivor Series, when Anderson left the WWF and returned to WCW.\nRick Rude moved into his new feud with Roddy Piper, with the two exchanging insults throughout the fall of 1989, including an incident on \"Prime Time Wrestling\" where they had an altercation that escalated after Rude spit on Piper. Their differences were settled in a steel cage match in December 1989, with Piper winning. Meanwhile, Ultimate Warrior defended his title primarily against André the Giant, regularly squashing the \"Eighth Wonder of the World\" in less than 30 seconds at house shows across the country (and at least once during a televised match from Madison Square Garden in New York City). With the departure of Blanchard and Anderson, André was placed in a tag team with Haku and dubbed the Colossal Connection; they immediately targeted Demolition and went on to win the Tag Team Championship during a December 1989 \"Superstars\" television taping. André's feud with Ultimate Warrior and placement in the tag team with Haku were ways of keeping the aging \"Eighth Wonder of the World\" in the spotlight, as his health was continuing to decline.\nThe other major feud that continued involved Ron Garvin and Greg Valentine. Upset at Garvin for his actions during SummerSlam, Valentine demanded that Garvin – who was still barred from competing after having lost a retirement match to Valentine – be reinstated so that the two could settle their differences once and for all. Garvin eventually got the upper hand in their last match, winning a submission match at the 1990 Royal Rumble.\nThe Red Rooster would appear in the 1990 Royal Rumble before leaving the WWF for WCW in mid 1990 and would return to his Terry Taylor persona, while Curt \"Mr. Perfect\" Hennig would move on to a feud with Brutus Beefcake after the Royal Rumble. Tito Santana and Rick Martel continued to face each other, with Santana defeating Martel in the finals of the King of the Ring tournament on October 14."

The Ultimate Warrior successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Rick Rude in a Steel Cage match, and Hulk Hogan defeated Earthquake by countout.\nThe pay-per-view also included two other title matches. Mr. Perfect lost his WWF Intercontinental Championship to the Texas Tornado, who was a substitute for Brutus Beefcake, who had been injured in a real-life parasailing accident. In the other title match, The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) won the WWF Tag Team Championship from Demolition (Smash and Crush) in a two out of three falls match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1990 event was the third SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 27, 1990, at The Spectrum in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\nStorylines.\nPaul Roma began feuding with The Rockers (Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty) during the July 21, 1990, episode of \"WWF Superstars\". Roma was attacked after a match by Dino Bravo; when The Rockers came to the ring for the following match, Roma accused them of attacking him. The argument turned physical, and Roma was backed up by Hercules. One week later, Roma and Hercules appeared on the Brother Love Show, an interview segment, and formed a tag team known as Power and Glory. A match between the two teams was later scheduled for SummerSlam.\nThe feud between Mr. Perfect and Brutus Beefcake began at the 1990 Royal Rumble. Beefcake, whose gimmick included cutting his opponents' hair, was wrestling The Genius, Perfect's manager. When he began giving The Genius a haircut when Perfect interfered and caused a double disqualification. Perfect and Beefcake wrestled each other at WrestleMania VI, and Beefcake won the match. Perfect won the Intercontinental Championship on April 23, 1990, in a tournament final. He had caused Beefcake to be eliminated from the tournament by interfering in his match. Beefcake and Perfect had a series of matches at house shows leading up to their planned SummerSlam match. One month before SummerSlam, on July 4, Beefcake was injured while he was standing on a beach and a female friend's knees hit him in the face while she was parasailing. Several bones in his face were legit broken, including his jaw and nose. As a result, the Texas Tornado replaced Beefcake in the SummerSlam match.\nAt the 1990 Royal Rumble, Sensational Sherri, Randy Savage's valet, appeared on the Brother Love show. Brother Love discussed the definition of a \"lady\", using Sherri as an example. He then discussed \"peasants\", bringing out Sapphire, Dusty Rhodes's valet, as an example. Sherri and Sapphire fought, which led to Savage and Rhodes fighting to defend their valets. Rhodes and Sapphire faced Savage and Sherri in a mixed tag team match at WrestleMania VI. Rhodes and Sapphire won the match with assistance from Miss Elizabeth, Savage's former valet. For SummerSlam, individual matches were scheduled, with Sapphire facing Sherri and Savage wrestling Rhodes. Meanwhile, Sapphire had been receiving gifts from an anonymous benefactor.\nTito Santana and Rick Martel formed a tag team named Strike Force in 1987. They won the WWF Tag Team Championship together before Martel abandoned Santana during a match against the Brain Busters at WrestleMania V. This led to a lengthy feud between the two, The team split up as a result and the former partners had a lengthy feud. and a blow off match was scheduled for SummerSlam. Martel was injured prior to the SummerSlam match, so the WWF created a storyline that he was unable to compete because he was participating in a modeling competition in Paris. He was replaced in the match with The Warlord, who had been competing against Santana on house shows since April.\nDemolition and The Hart Foundation had faced each other two years earlier at SummerSlam 1988; Demolition had successfully defended the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Hart Foundation duo of Jim Neidhart and Bret Hart later focused on singles wrestling but soon reunited as a team.

The Hart Foundation faced The Rockers on the April 28 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXVI\". Demolition interfered, causing a double disqualification. On the July 14 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", Demolition and The Hart Foundation brawled after The Hart Foundation claimed that Demolition having three members was evidence of cowardice. The following week, a match between the teams was scheduled for SummerSlam. The stipulations stated that it would be a two out of three falls match and that only two members of Demolition would be allowed at ringside.\nThe feud between Bad News Brown and Jake Roberts began when Roberts sent Brown a birthday present on the April 22 episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\". Upon opening the package, Brown found a rubber snake, to which he reacted with horror. On the May 5 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", the two men agreed to a match; Brown later stated that his fear of snakes was cured but was quickly proven wrong. On the July 28 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", a match between Brown and Roberts was scheduled for SummerSlam with the Big Boss Man as a guest referee. Brown commented that he would bring 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats to counteract Roberts's boa constrictor, Damian.\nNikolai Volkoff began the year partnered with Boris Zhukov in a pro-Soviet tag team known as The Bolsheviks. After Lithuania, Volkoff's homeland, declared its independence from the Soviet Union on March 11, 1990, The Bolsheviks split up.

They were then booked to face a Japanese team known as The Orient Express at SummerSlam.\nAs Hulk Hogan was being interviewed on The Brother Love Show during the May 26 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", he was attacked by Earthquake. Earthquake hit Hogan with a chair and jumped on his stomach with an Earthquake splash. Hogan was taken from the stage on a stretcher. Hogan did not appear on WWF programming for almost two months, as the company teased his possible retirement. On the July 14 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", Hogan revealed that he would return to the ring against Earthquake at SummerSlam. Hogan's friend Tugboat was supposed to be in his corner during the match, but he was attacked by Earthquake and Dino Bravo on the August 18 episode of \"WWF Superstars\" and received two Earthquake splashes before being rescued by the Big Bossman.

The Ultimate Warrior defeated Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania VI; he was forced to give up the Intercontinental Championship, and Rick Rude was named the top challenger for SummerSlam. The match was later scheduled as a steel cage match.\nTo build anticipation for the pay-per-view event, the WWF broadcast \"SummerSlam Fever\" on the USA Network.

It also included nine matches that included wrestlers who would be competing at SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nBefore the pay-per-view began, Shane Douglas defeated Buddy Rose in a dark match. Hercules attacked Shawn Michaels prior to the first televised bout, hitting him in the knee with a chain. Although his partner was unable to compete, Jannetty controlled the beginning of the match, using hip tosses to throw Roma and Hercules. Power and Glory then attacked Jannetty while their manager, Slick, distracted the referee. Although Jannetty was able to mount a brief comeback, Roma and Hercules wore him down and got the victory after performing a PowerPlex—a superplex from Hercules followed by a diving splash from Roma.\nThe Texas Tornado got an early advantage in his match with Mr. Perfect, controlling the bout with several power moves. Mr. Perfect recovered and used a neckbreaker and sleeper hold to wear down the Tornado. As Perfect was showing off for the crowd, the Tornado attacked him from behind. He wore Perfect down with a clawhold before hitting him with a discus punch to win the match and the Intercontinental Championship.\nSensational Sherri came to the ring for her match against Sapphire, but Sapphire did not come to the ring. As a result, Sherri was awarded the victory by forfeit.\nTito Santana began his match with The Warlord by locking his opponent in a headlock and dropkicking him out of the ring. The Warlord took control of the match when he returned to the ring, using his strength to control the match. Slick, The Warlord's manager, interfered, but Santana regained a brief advantage. The Warlord gained the victory by pinning Santana after performing a running powerslam.\nIn the two out of three falls tag team match, Crush and Smash represented Demolition against the team of Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart. Both teams relied on brawling tactics during the first fall, which was awarded to Demolition when they pinned Hart after performing the Demolition Decapitation. They continued to wear down Hart until Neidhart tagged back into the match. He and Hart took turns attacking Smash before performing the Hart Attack. Before they could pin him, however, Crush prevented the referee from making a pinfall count, which resulted in a disqualification. During the third fall, Demolition distracted the referee, enabling Ax, their third member, to come to hide at ringside. When Smash was knocked out of the ring, Ax took his place while Smash hid. Well rested, Ax used his power to control the match against Hart. Ax and Smash traded places again, but the Legion of Doom appeared and pulled Ax out from under the ring. With Smash distracted, Hart and Neidhart were able to tackle Crush and pin him to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nDuring the following match, a covered cage sat at ringside, supposedly containing 200 pounds of Harlem sewer rats, although the contents of the cage were not revealed. Bad News Brown controlled most of the early stages of his match against Jake Roberts. Roberts attempted to perform the DDT twice, including once when Brown was arguing with special referee Big Bossman, but Brown blocked the move both times. Outside the ring, Brown hit Roberts with a chair while the Big Bossman was not looking. Roberts gained the advantage by punching Brown repeatedly but was kicked to the outside after Brown reversed a DDT attempt into a back bodydrop. Brown hit Roberts with a chair again but was disqualified when the Bossman saw him. Brown tried to gain revenge after the match by attacking Roberts's boa constrictor, Damien, but the Bossman attacked Brown to save the snake.\nSgt. Slaughter was a guest on The Brother Love Show.

They were attacked by The Orient Express (Akio Sato and Pat Tanaka), and all four men fought in the ring. Sato and Tanaka attacked Volkoff while preventing him from tagging Duggan into the match; Mr. Fuji, the manager of The Orient Express, also hit Volkoff with his cane. When Tanaka missed a big splash, Volkoff tagged in Duggan, who performed several clotheslines on Tanaka and Sato.

Rhodes walked down the aisle toward DiBiase and Sapphire but was attacked from behind by Savage. Savage controlled most of the match, and Sherri interfered to help him while the referee was distracted. Rhodes made a brief comeback, but Savage was able to pin him after hitting him with Sherri's purse, which was said to be loaded with a heavy object. After the match, Rhodes chased after DiBiase and Sapphire but was unable to catch up to their departing limousine.\nControl went back and forth at the beginning of the match between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake. When Earthquake rolled out of the ring, both wrestlers' corner-men got involved, as Hogan and the Big Boss Man fought against Earthquake and Dino Bravo.

Hogan got back into the ring and won the match via countout. Earthquake attacked Hogan after the match, but the Big Boss Man saved Hogan by hitting Earthquake with a chair.\nThe Ultimate Warrior gained the early advantage in his steel cage match with Rick Rude. After the Warrior missed a splash attempt, Rude attempted to win the match by escaping the cage. The Warrior stopped him, and both wrestlers unsuccessfully attempted to perform their finishing moves. Rude was then able to perform a Rude Awakening neckbreaker but chose to continue attacking the Warrior rather than escape the cage. Rude performed a shoulderblock and tried to leave through the cage door. The Warrior held him back while Bobby Heenan, Rude's manager, tried to pull Rude out. The Warrior pulled both Rude and Heenan into the cage. He punched Heenan and then threw him out of the cage with an atomic drop. Warrior then knocked Rude down three times with clotheslines and threw him onto the ring floor with a gorilla press drop. Warrior climbed over the cage and dropped to the arena floor to win the match and retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nReception.\nThe attendance for the event was 19,304, which was the lowest attendance of the first seven SummerSlams. The WWF collected $338,452 from ticket revenue. The pay-per-view buyrate was 3.8, which was down from the previous year's 4.8 but higher than the following year's 2.7 buyrate.\nSummerSlam 1990 was released on VHS by Coliseum Video on September 27, 1990, in the United States. The VHS edition was released in the United Kingdom on April 6, 1992. It was first released on DVD as part of Silver Vision's WWE Tagged Classics series on August 1, 2005. The event is also included as part of WWE's SummerSlam Anthology boxed DVD set. The anthology was released on August 5, 2008, in North America and was released on October 6, 2008, in the United Kingdom.\nAftermath.\nAfter Michaels took time off to have knee surgery for a legit injury suffered prior to SummerSlam (he noticeably limped to the ring and the pre-match attack where Hercules hit him in the knee with his chain was so that Michaels would not actually have to wrestle), his return saw The Rockers continue to feud with Power and Glory, and the teams faced each other during an elimination match at the 1990 Survivor Series. Power and Glory's team won the match, during which Roma eliminated Michaels after performing a PowerPlex with Hercules.\nThe Texas Tornado held the Intercontinental Championship for almost three months before dropping it back to Perfect on November 19. The match was aired on the December 15 edition of WWF Superstars. The two men were also on opposite sides for an elimination match at Survivor Series. Perfect eliminated the Tornado with a PerfectPlex, but the Tornado's team won the match. Brutus Beefcake did not wrestle again until 1993.\nDusty Rhodes continued to feud with Randy Savage after SummerSlam. During their match on the October 22 episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", Ted DiBiase interfered and attacked Rhodes's son, Dustin. DiBiase and Dusty Rhodes faced each other as part of an elimination match at Survivor Series 1990; DiBiase won the match for his team. The continued rivalry led to a tag team match at the 1991 Royal Rumble that pitted Dusty and Dustin Rhodes against DiBiase and his bodyguard, Virgil. DiBiase and Virgil won the match and then began feuding with each other. Sapphire left the WWF soon after SummerSlam, and Savage stopped feuding with Rhodes in favor of challenging the Ultimate Warrior for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nAfter Martel returned from his injury, he was placed in a storyline in which he blinded Jake Roberts by spraying him in the face with cologne on the Brother Love Show. Martel and Santana faced each other on the November 11 episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\", and Roberts interfered. Unable to see clearly, he accidentally attacked Santana but vowed revenge against Martel. Bad News Brown left the WWF after SummerSlam, citing broken promises as his reason.\nThe Hart Foundation held the WWF Tag Team Championship for almost seven months before dropping the title belts to The Nasty Boys on March 24, 1991, at Wrestlemania VII. Demolition feuded with the Legion of Doom, including several six-man matches in which the Ultimate Warrior sided with the Legion of Doom. They also faced each other at Survivor Series 1990 as part of an elimination match. During the match, Smash, Crush, and both members of the Legion of Doom were disqualified for fighting outside the ring. Demolition was disbanded altogether shortly thereafter, although Smash and Crush continued to wrestle under different gimmicks.\nNikolai Volkoff competed at Survivor Series 1990 in a match that pitted him and his partners against Sgt. Slaughter, Boris Zhukov, and The Orient Express. He was eliminated by Slaughter, who was later disqualified when his manager, General Adnan hit Tito Santana with an Iraqi flag. Slaughter and Volkoff also faced each other on many house shows throughout the second half of 1990. Slaughter won the majority of these contests before setting his sights on the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nAt the 1990 Survivor Series, Hogan and Tugboat were members of the Hulkamaniacs team in a match against the Natural Disasters team, which included Earthquake and Bravo. Hogan eliminated Bravo, and Tugboat and Earthquake were both counted out while fighting each other. The Hulkamaniacs won the match, with Hogan as the only wrestler remaining at the end. During the 1991 Royal Rumble match, Hogan eliminated his friend Tugboat. Hogan and Earthquake were the final two wrestlers at the end; Hogan eliminated Earthquake to win the match. Tugboat later turned heel and changed his name to Typhoon; he and Earthquake formed a tag team known as The Natural Disasters.\nRude left the WWF in late 1990 due to a dispute with the company about money. As a result, Bobby Heenan took his place in matches that had already been booked against the Big Boss Man. The Ultimate Warrior held the WWF World Heavyweight Championship until dropping it to Sgt. Slaughter at the 1991 Royal Rumble."

        "text": "The 1991 SummerSlam was the fourth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Monday, August 26, 1991, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Nine matches were contested at the event, including a dark match held before the live broadcast. This was the second event to take place in Madison Square Garden, the first since 1988.\nSummerSlam 1991 is remembered for the on-screen wedding of Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth, dubbed \"A Match Made in Heaven\" by announcer Gene Okerlund. Savage and Elizabeth had been married in real life since December 1984. WWF personalities shown at the reception afterward included Bobby Heenan, Gene Okerlund, J. J. Dillon, The Undertaker, and Jake Roberts. The last two were uninvited guests. Roberts proceeded to frighten Elizabeth with his snake while Undertaker attacked Savage with an urn.\nThis was contrasted with \"A Match Made in Hell\", the main event of the show, which was a handicap tag team match between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and The Ultimate Warrior against Sgt. Slaughter, General Adnan, and Colonel Mustafa. It was Slaughter's final on-screen appearance as an Iraqi sympathizer, a storyline fueled by the Gulf War.\nAmong the other on-screen highlights of the event was The Legion of Doom (Animal and Hawk) defeating The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobbs and Jerry Sags) to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. The team became the only tag team in wrestling history to have held the WWF Tag Team Championship, the NWA World Tag Team Championship, and the AWA World Tag Team Championship. Another highlight was Bret Hart winning his first singles championship in the WWF when he defeated Mr. Perfect for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. After winning the match, Hart climbed into the stands to hug his parents Stu and Helen Hart.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1991 event was the fourth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on Monday, August 26, 1991, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York.\nAftermath.\nHighlights of the wedding reception for Randy Savage and Miss Elizabeth were aired on the WWF's syndicated and cable programs, and included The Undertaker and Jake Roberts crashing the party. Savage – who was still barred from competing as an active wrestler, per his WrestleMania VII \"retirement match\" loss to the Ultimate Warrior – would become the target of Roberts' insults, which continued to grow through the fall of 1991. Eventually, Savage had enough and, while doing color commentary duties on \"WWF Superstars\", came to the ring while Roberts was delivering an anti-Savage promo, only for Roberts to severely beat Savage, tie him into the ring ropes and allow his devenomized king cobra to bite his arm. The aftermath of that incident led to Savage's reinstatement as an active wrestler and a match at the \"This Tuesday in Texas\" pay-per-view event. \nFollowing his team's loss to Hogan and Ultimate Warrior, Slaughter re-evaluated his support of Iraq, acknowledged he had made a bad decision and became a face again, appearing in vignettes next to American landmarks, saying \"I want my country back.\" During an episode of \"Superstars\", Jim Duggan was under attack from The Nasty Boys, and Slaughter made the save. Duggan and Slaughter teamed up to defeat the Nasty Boys and continued to team over the next several months; Slaughter also defeated Colonel Mustafa and General Adnan in a series of matches. Despite Slaughter's face turn, he was still named 1991's \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" magazine for his pro-Iraqi gimmick.\nSummerSlam 1991 marked André the Giant's last United States pay-per-view appearance in his lifetime. By now using crutches to get around due to his continuing health problems with acromegaly, André would make several appearances during the WWF's tour of England in September and October 1991. These were his last appearances in the WWF during his lifetime, as he died on January 27, 1993. Also dealing with injuries was Mr. Perfect, who would take a three-month-long absence from the WWF to recuperate; he would return to WWF television as a heel-favoring color commentator on \"Superstars\". He would not return to in ring competition again until the 1992 Survivor Series.\nRick \"The Dragon\" Steamboat left the WWF before Survivor Series 1991 to return to WCW, Steamboat had been rumored to be \"squashed\" by The Undertaker to get him ready for his WWF World Title run against Hulk Hogan. Ted DiBiase would finish up his feud with his former manservant Virgil (and regain his Million-Dollar Belt in the process), quietly remove Sensational Sherri as his valet (who would move to be Shawn Michaels' valet), then team up with Irwin R. Schyster (IRS) to form Money Inc in early 1992. The Nasty Boys would move on into a feud with the Bushwhackers and the Rockers, which would be settled at Survivor Series. Power and Glory would split after the events of SummerSlam; Paul Roma departed WWF in October 1991, took some time off, then move to WCW and join the Four Horsemen (instead of Tully Blanchard, who was offered but refused due to low pay) in 1993, and Hercules would also move to WCW in early 1992 and become \"The Super Invader\" before heading to Japan the following year.\nKoko B. Ware would team up with Owen Hart to form \"High Energy\" and would pursue, unsuccessfully, the WWF World Tag Team titles. Meanwhile, The Mountie would begin targeting Bret Hart for the Intercontinental Championship, eventually winning the title shortly before the 1992 Royal Rumble.\nUltimate Warrior controversy.\nOff-screen, there was an incident involving The Ultimate Warrior and Vince McMahon at this event. One month before the pay-per-view, Warrior wrote a letter to McMahon threatening to no-show the main event tag team match unless paid $550,000 that he claimed was owed to him from his work at WrestleMania VII. In 2005, it was revealed by Hulk Hogan and Sgt. Slaughter that dealing with the matter physically for Vince McMahon was a possibility when they became aware of Warrior's threat.\nMcMahon, who did not want Hogan and Slaughter to get into a physical altercation with Warrior, paid Warrior the money, and then fired him immediately following SummerSlam. Warrior later responded on his website to these allegations by stating he was owed money stemming from work performed at WrestleMania VII and that he was actually suspended by McMahon immediately after the show, but quit the WWF out of protest. McMahon would later state that while he couldn't make a last-minute change in the card due to the fans expecting the match, he \"could not wait to fire him\" after the pay-per-view, which according to Jake Roberts, he did- right after Warrior came through the curtain after the match. As a result Warrior was not present for the in-ring celebration with Hogan and Sid Justice following the match. In the aftermath, Warrior's anticipated feud with Jake Roberts – who, in another storyline that aired a few weeks earlier, had turned heel after tricking Warrior into believing he would aid him in his feud with The Undertaker – was canceled, and the Roberts-Savage feud was conceived instead. Roberts revealed in an interview that he was so furious with Warrior (because of the loss of money he could have made and the title run he was guaranteed with one of the company's biggest stars at the time), that he carried hostile feelings towards Warrior for many years."

        "text": "The 1992 SummerSlam was the fifth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Saturday, August 29, 1992, at Wembley Stadium in London, England and aired on tape delay on Monday, August 31, 1992. It was the first major WWF pay-per-view to take place outside North America.\nThe pay-per-view included two main event matches. In the first, The Ultimate Warrior challenged \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. The Ultimate Warrior won the match by countout but did not win the title. In the other main event, \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith pinned Bret Hart to win the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship. The undercard also included The Natural Disasters retaining the WWF Tag Team Championship against the Beverly Brothers and Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel wrestling to a double countout in a match with the stipulation that the wrestlers were banned from hitting each other in the face.\nThe event had an attendance As of 78,927. WWE themselves claimed a disputed attendance of 80,355, which would make it their seventh-biggest event. Between ticket prices and merchandise sales, the WWF made over $3,650,000 in revenue. Reviews of the event are almost all positive, with the Smith–Hart match rated as the best match in SummerSlam history.\nOn April 29, 2022, it was announced that a 30th anniversary DVD and Blu-ray would be released for the United Kingdom and European markets to celebrate the anniversary of the event on August 29, exactly 30 years to the event taking place. The release would also include all live event dark matches for the first time which are not a part of the WWE Network showing or on the previous release. During a WWE Live event at London's O2 Arena that same day, it was announced that WWE would return to the United Kingdom to host another major stadium event titled Clash at the Castle in September 2022.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, eventually dubbed the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1992 event was the fifth event in the SummerSlam chronology.\nSummerSlam 1992 was originally intended to take place at the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland. However, the WWF decided to move the event to Wembley Stadium in London, England due to the company's growing popularity in the United Kingdom and the possibility of increasing the revenue from the event. The event was scheduled to be held on Saturday, August 29, 1992, and it aired on tape delay on Monday, August 31. Shawn Michaels was originally booked to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart, but the storyline was adjusted due to the change of venue. As a result, \"The British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith, a native of Golborne, a working-class town in the north of England, was chosen to win the belt.\nStorylines.\nOne of the main events was the Intercontinental Championship match between Bret Hart and Davey Boy Smith, brothers-in-law in real life as Smith was married to Diana Hart, Bret's sister. On television broadcasts leading up to SummerSlam, interviews with Diana and her mother Helen portrayed the family as being torn apart by the upcoming match. Bruce Hart publicly supported Smith, while Owen Hart sided with his brother Bret. Diana stated that she did not know who she wanted to win the match, as she had close ties to both men. She ultimately stated that she simply hoped that neither wrestler would get hurt. Prior to the match, Smith was hospitalized with a legitimate staph infection in his knee. Despite the concerns about his health, he decided to wrestle the match as planned. Bret Hart later revealed in an interview that he doubted the legitimacy of the injury.\nThe other main event was a WWF Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage. Although they had a previous run of house show matches in early 1989, the rivalry between them began in earnest in the fall of 1990, when Sensational Sherri, who was managing Savage, tried to arrange a match between Savage and Warrior. The Warrior refused to defend his WWF Championship against Savage, and he ripped up a contract that Sherri had given him. While they faced each other at house shows over the next few months, where Savage was unable to win the title, they never had a televised match with each other. Savage then interfered in the title match at Royal Rumble 1991, enabling Sgt. Slaughter to win the title. To settle the rivalry, Savage and the Warrior agreed to face each other in a retirement match at WrestleMania VII. The Warrior won the match, forcing Savage into retirement. However, Savage would be reinstated as an active wrestler in November 1991. by which time the Warrior had left the WWF.\nThe following year, the rivalry was rekindled when the Ultimate Warrior, having returned to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII on April 5, 1992. was granted a shot at the WWF Championship, which Savage had won from Ric Flair earlier that same evening. Flair and his executive consultant Mr. Perfect, were upset that Flair had not been granted a rematch. They decided to cause trouble between Savage and the Warrior. In August, Perfect claimed that he was in negotiations with Savage and Warrior, who both had sought his managerial services, but refused to clarify which wrestler he would support at SummerSlam. At the \"SummerSlam Spectacular\", a show designed to promote the pay-per-view, Savage and the Warrior teamed up to face The Nasty Boys. Perfect and Ric Flair interfered in the match, resulting in a count-out victory for the Nasty Boys and more animosity between Savage and Warrior.\nThe undercard included two tag team matches: Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) and The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) had been feuding in 1992 over the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Legion of Doom held the championship belts until dropping the title to Money Inc. This title change occurred after Hawk failed a drug test and was suspended. Once Hawk's suspension ended, a rematch was scheduled to take place at SummerSlam. The match was first scheduled as a title match but Money Inc. lost the championship to The Natural Disasters.\nMeanwhile, the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) and the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly) had a rivalry dating back to a match aired on \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\" on July 20, 1992. While Earthquake brawled with Beau and Blake, Typhoon attacked the Beverlys' manager, The Genius. When the Disasters won the WWF Tag Team Championship, their SummerSlam match was transformed into a title match.\nThe rivalry between Shawn Michaels against Rick Martel centred around Martel's attempts to steal Michaels' manager Sensational Sherri. During one of Michaels' matches televised on August 9, 1992, Martel came to ringside and winked at Sherri, who returned the gesture. At the \"SummerSlam Spectacular\", Sherri came to the ring during one of Martel's matches and winked at him. Both Michaels and Martel were \"heel\" wrestlers who bragged about their good looks, and Sherri had them agree not to hit each other in the face during their SummerSlam match.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the pay-per-view broadcast began, two matches were taped for later showings on \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\". These matches were never advertised on US television in the weeks leading up to SummerSlam. The first match saw \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan and The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Luke and Bushwhacker Butch) defeat The Mountie and The Nasty Boys (Brian Knobs and Jerry Sags) when Duggan pinned The Mountie. In the other match, Papa Shango defeated Tito Santana by pinfall.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal) taking on Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster). The Legion of Doom used their size and power to wear down their opponents in the opening minutes of the match. Money Inc. gained the advantage when Hawk missed a flying clothesline. Hawk tried to tag in his partner but was unable for several minutes because Money Inc. kept him away from the corner where Animal was standing. Eventually, Hawk and Schyster hit each other at the same time. Hawk tagged Animal in, and the Legion of Doom attempted the Doomsday device, their signature move. Schyster stopped them, but Animal hit Schyster in retaliation, causing Schyster to run into DiBiase. Animal then powerslammed DiBiase and pinned him to get the victory.\nThe second match of the broadcast pitted Nailz against Virgil. Nailz spent the majority of the match choking Virgil. Virgil recovered several times and performed several offensive maneuvers, but Nailz always regained the advantage. Ultimately, Nailz won the match by performing a sleeper hold. After the match, he attacked Virgil with a nightstick.\nIn the following match, competitors Shawn Michaels and Rick Martel were unable, due to a pre-match stipulation, to hit each other in the face. The two men exchanged holds but were both preoccupied with looking to ringside for approval from Sensational Sherri. Martel gained the advantage by throwing Michaels to the outside of the ring and attacking him there. When the two returned to the ring, they took turns attempting to pin their opponent, pulling down their opponent's wrestling tights to reveal their buttocks each time. Michaels then kicked Martel and tried to pin him, but the referee stopped the three-count because Michaels' feet were on the ropes. Both wrestlers broke the pre-match stipulation by slapping each other in the face. Sherri pretended to faint, which drew the attention of both wrestlers. Michaels and Martel argued over who would carry Sherri backstage, with each man carrying her a few feet before being stopped by his opponent. Both wrestlers were counted out, but they continued to argue. Martel tried to revive Sherri by throwing a bucket of water over her head. Michaels dropped Sherri and chased Martel backstage; upset at being publicly humiliated and then left behind by both men, Sherri screamed and cried as she ran backstage.\nThe tag team championship match came next, which saw the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly) attack the Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) before the bell. The Disasters used their size and strength to gain the advantage, but Earthquake accidentally performed an avalanche on Typhoon. The Beverlys controlled the match for several minutes, with Blake executing a splash and a front facelock. Typhoon recovered and clotheslined both opponents but was unable to tag in Earthquake. Later, Typhoon tried to tag again, but Beau distracted Earthquake; while the referee's back was turned, The Beverlys' manager, The Genius handed Blake a metal scroll, which Blake used to hit Typhoon. Typhoon recovered, however, and Earthquake entered the ring and controlled the remainder of the match. He performed a powerslam on Beau before pinning him with an Earthquake splash.\nThe following match, which was not broadcast in the United Kingdom, pitted Crush against the Repo Man. Crush used his size advantage to perform a Gorilla press slam on Repo Man. Repo Man performed a back suplex, but Crush showed no sign that the move affected him. Crush continued to dominate the match with such moves as a belly to belly suplex. Repo Man eventually tried to attack Crush by jumping off the top rope, but Crush caught him and performed the Cranium Crunch to win the match by submission.\nMain event matches.\nOne of the two main event matches came next, as Randy Savage defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against the Ultimate Warrior. Although Mr. Perfect had claimed that he would be in the corner of one of the competitors, he did not come to ringside for the beginning of the match. Savage and the Warrior traded the advantage back and forth, with Savage performing several clotheslines and punching his opponent and the Ultimate Warrior countering with atomic drops. Savage executed two double axe handles from the top rope, but the Warrior caught him when Savage attempted the move a third time. After the Warrior missed a move and fell outside the ring, Savage jumped from the top rope and performed another double axe handle. Once the wrestlers got back into the ring, Ric Flair and Mr. Perfect walked down the aisle and stood at ringside. The match continued as normal until Perfect reached into the ring and tripped Savage, who was running to gain momentum for a maneuver. The Ultimate Warrior accidentally threw Savage into referee Earl Hebner. As a result of the ref bump, Hebner was not able to make the three-count when Savage pinned the Warrior after performing a diving elbow drop. Perfect and Flair revived the Ultimate Warrior, only to attack him when he stood up. The Warrior recovered and attempted a running splash, but Flair hit him with a chair. Savage saw the Warrior injured and realized that Flair and Perfect were causing trouble rather than trying to help either man. In retaliation, Savage jumped off the top rope to attack Flair, but Flair hit him in the leg with a chair. Savage was unable to get back into the ring, so the Ultimate Warrior won the match via countout. Flair and Perfect continued to attack Savage until the Warrior chased them away. Savage and the Ultimate Warrior then hugged and walked backstage together.\nThe next match pitted the Undertaker against Kamala, who was accompanied by his manager, Harvey Wippleman, and his handler, Kim Chee. Kamala attacked before the match but the Undertaker blocked the attack and punched Kamala repeatedly before performing a chop from the top rope on his opponent. The Undertaker attempted the same move again, but Wippleman knocked the Undertaker off the rope. Kamala knocked the Undertaker outside the ring, where the Undertaker attacked Wippleman and Kim Chee. Back inside the ring, the Undertaker gained the advantage by executing a chokeslam and a clothesline. When the Undertaker attempted his signature move, the Tombstone Piledriver, Kim Chee ran into the ring and hit the Undertaker with a pith helmet. As a result, Kamala was disqualified and the Undertaker won the match. Kamala kept on attacking and hit Undertaker with a series of splashes and seemingly left his opponent unconscious. When the Undertaker suddenly sat up and looked directly at the Ugandan Giant, Kamala, Wippleman and Kim Chee panicked and fled ringside with The Undertaker and Paul Bearer slowly walking in pursuit.\nNext, Tatanka defeated The Berzerker by pinfall. This match was originally scheduled as part of the pay-per-view. Due to time constraints it was cut from the PPV lineup in post-production. The match, however, later aired on \"WWF Prime Time Wrestling\". On the Silver Vision home video release in the UK, this match was placed after the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match. Up next, Rowdy Roddy Piper joined the Balmoral Highlanders in playing Scotland the Brave on the bagpipes.\nThe event concluded with the second main event, a contest for the Intercontinental Championship between champion Bret Hart and challenger \"British Bulldog\" Davey Boy Smith, who was accompanied by the reigning Commonwealth Heavyweight Boxing Champion, London native Lennox Lewis. In the opening minutes, Hart used his technical wrestling abilities and Smith relied on his power advantage. Hart got control of the match with a reverse atomic drop and a Samoan drop. Smith came back with a monkey flip, but Hart regained the advantage with a bulldog and a plancha. Smith eventually recovered and tried to pin Hart with a back slide. Hart escaped the pin attempt and wore Smith down with sleeper holds. Smith gained the advantage, however, and used power moves to control the match, including a running powerslam and a variety of suplexes. Hart managed to place Smith in the Sharpshooter, Hart's signature submission hold. Smith escaped the hold, however, and threw Hart against the ropes. While running back at Smith, Hart attempted a sunset flip. Smith countered the move and pinned Hart to win the Intercontinental Championship. Immediately after the match, Hart refused to shake Smith's hand. He soon changed his mind, however, and hugged Smith as well as Diana Hart, who was celebrating with her husband. Writing in his autobiography \"Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling\", Hart recalled that prior to the match, he had been unable to contact Smith to prepare for the match as Smith had spent the few weeks before the match smoking crack cocaine with Jim Neidhart.\nReception.\nAccording to the WWF, the 80,355 people were in attendance for SummerSlam 1992, which at that time was behind only WrestleMania III in attendance (though has since been surpassed by future events). WrestleMania III was said to have attracted 93,173 crowd. However some observers place the attendance for WrestleMania III closer to 78,000, which makes the crowd for SummerSlam 1992 arguably the biggest verified crowd in WWF history until WrestleMania 29 in 2013.\nThe event has received positive reviews from a variety of sources. RD Reynolds has called it \"a huge success\". The atmosphere in the stadium was a big part of the event's success, with Tomás Cunha claiming the fans \"elevate[d] everything to the next level\". In particular, the Intercontinental Championship match has been called \"one of the greatest matches of all time\". \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named it the Match of the Year in the magazine's year-end issue, and WWE has called the match the greatest moment in SummerSlam history. Bret Hart has also named it as his favorite match of all time.\nThe WWF collected $2,200,000 in revenue from admissions, up from $445,000 the previous year. The company also sold $1,456,203 in merchandise at SummerSlam, which is the largest amount of merchandise revenue at a WWF event. The buyrate for the event was 1.5, down from 2.7 at SummerSlam 1991 but higher than the 1.3 buyrate at SummerSlam 1993.\nSummerSlam 1992 was released on VHS format on September 24, 1992. While the US release only included the eight matches shown on pay-per-view, the UK release included all eleven matches including the three dark matches. On October 3, 2005 in the United Kingdom, the event was released on DVD, packaged together with SummerSlam 1993, as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line. The event was again later released as part of WWE's SummerSlam Anthology boxed DVD set. The anthology was released on August 5, 2008 in North America and was released on October 6, 2008 in the United Kingdom. However, the version that is included with the Anthology is only the 8 match PPV broadcast version.\nAftermath.\nRandy Savage, who continued to sell his supposedly injured leg, lost the title to Ric Flair at a television taping on September 1, 1992 in Hershey, Pennsylvania. During the match Flair received help not only from Mr Perfect but also from newcomer Razor Ramon, igniting a feud between Savage and Ramon. Bret Hart claimed in a 2014 interview that WWF owner Vince McMahon had worked out the title-change match with Flair and Savage before hand, and that he was angry when they returned to the dressing room after the match because they had failed to do much of what was agreed upon. McMahon was so angry that he actually sent Bobby Heenan out to signal that the match be aborted and then made them go straight back out and restart the whole match. After producing much the same match that they had immediately prior, McMahon allegedly threw his headset onto the table and stormed off in frustration.\nWWF writers had originally planned that the Ultimate Warrior should be the one to accept Mr Perfect's services, turning heel in the process of winning the title and that, as new champion, he would further feud with Savage. After these plans were scrapped at a late stage due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel after considering the collapse in merchandise sales which would have resulted, the two were scheduled to face Flair and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of Flair, thereby turning face and initiating a feud with Flair which culminated in Flair leaving the WWF in January 1993.\nShawn Michaels, who had originally been booked to win the Intercontinental Championship from Bret Hart at SummerSlam, won the title from Davey Boy Smith on October 27 (the match would air on the November 14, 1992 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXI\"). Michaels and Sherri continued their on-screen relationship after SummerSlam. Sherri claimed to have created the rivalry with Martel to test Michaels' love for her. Their relationship deteriorated, though when Michaels pulled Sherri in front of him to protect himself from an attack by his former tag team partner, Marty Jannetty on the October 31 episode of \"WWF Superstars\". This led to confrontations between Sherri and Michaels at the 1993 Royal Rumble and WrestleMania IX.\nThe Undertaker continued to feud with Kamala and Harvey Wippleman. The two wrestlers faced each other again at Survivor Series 1992 in a coffin match, which the Undertaker won. Wippleman gained revenge by introducing Giant Gonzalez (and later Mr. Hughes), with whom the Undertaker feuded through 1993.\nUpset about the amount of his pay for appearing at SummerSlam, Kevin Wacholz (Nailz) confronted WWF owner Vince McMahon after Survivor Series 1992. According to reports, he legitimately attacked McMahon. As a result, Nailz was fired from the WWF. He briefly appeared in rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as the Prisoner but was released after the WWF sued WCW because of The Prisoner's similarity to the Nailz character. The anger between Wacholz and McMahon spilled over into McMahon's 1994 trial, in which McMahon was accused of distributing steroids to wrestlers. Although Wacholz testified against McMahon, his statements, which included, \"I hate Vince McMahon's guts\" ultimately proved harmful to the prosecution's case."

        "text": "The 1993 SummerSlam was the sixth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 30, 1993, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan and featured ten televised matches.\nAll three of the WWF's then-active championships were defended at the event. The main event saw Lex Luger challenge Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. On the undercard, The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) defended the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Heavenly Bodies (Jimmy Del Ray and Tom Prichard), and Shawn Michaels defended the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Mr. Perfect. In addition to the title matches, Bret Hart and Jerry Lawler were scheduled to wrestle to settle their feud and determine who would be named \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation.\"\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and one of the \"Big Five\", along with King of the Ring that was established in June 1993. It has since been considered WWE’s second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1993 event was the sixth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 30, 1993, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\nStorylines.\nTwo of the matches at SummerSlam 1993 were a result of Razor Ramon's loss to The Kid (later the 1-2-3 Kid) on the May 17, 1993 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\". Following Ramon's loss to the newcomer, Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster) teased Ramon about the match. DiBiase offered Ramon a job as a servant, which Ramon angrily refused. Ramon began teaming with the 1-2-3 Kid for a series of matches against Money Inc. DiBiase asked for a singles match against the Kid, and the Kid accepted the challenge. Ramon helped the Kid win the match by distracting DiBiase. It was decided that the feuds would be settled in two singles matches at SummerSlam, with Ramon facing DiBiase and Schyster facing the 1-2-3 Kid.\nThe match between the Steiner Brothers and The Heavenly Bodies received little buildup. The Bodies were a successful tag team in Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling, and an interpromotional agreement allowed them to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nThe rivalry between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began at WrestleMania IX. During a fight after the match between Lex Luger and Mr. Perfect, Shawn Michaels appeared and attacked Perfect. Mr. Perfect gained revenge by distracting Michaels at the May 17, 1993 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\", allowing Marty Jannetty to pin Michaels and win the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels regained the belt the following month with the help of his new bodyguard, Diesel.\nBret Hart and Jerry Lawler had a heated feud, stemming from Lawler interrupting Hart's victory ceremony at the 1993 King of the Ring tournament. Lawler insisted that he was the true king of the WWF and attacked Hart. The feud intensified as Lawler taunted and attacked Bret's family, including his parents and his younger brother Owen.\nAccording to a story relayed by Bret Hart on the TSN sports show Off The Record, Hart was originally supposed to wrestle Hulk Hogan for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. From Hart’s explanation of matters, the reason the match did not happen was because Hogan changed his mind, as he was supposedly not happy with the planned finish. As a result, Hogan lost the belt to Yokozuna at King of the Ring 1993 instead. However, this has never been officially explained by WWE (then WWF), and is part of Professional Wrestling lore on the Internet. Eventually Bret Hart and Yokozuna would have a rematch at WrestleMania X, where Hart’s storyline loss of the title was avenged, when he beat Yokozuna to start his second reign as WWF Champion.\nMarty Jannetty was originally supposed to face Rick Martel, but Ludvig Borga replaced Martel well before the match. The match received little buildup, although Borga appeared in several vignettes leading up to the match. He criticized the United States for such reasons as its pollution. Jannetty vowed to defend America's pride in his match against Borga.\nThe buildup for the match between Giant Gonzalez and The Undertaker began after the Undertaker defeated Kamala in a Coffin match at Survivor Series 1992. Kamala's manager Harvey Wippleman vowed revenge and introduced Gonzalez at Royal Rumble 1993, with Gonzalez attacking and eliminating the Undertaker. Gonzalez and the Undertaker wrestled at WrestleMania IX, and Gonzalez knocked the Undertaker unconscious with a chloroform-soaked rag. The feud intensified when Wippleman, Gonzalez and Mr. Hughes attacked the Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer. They stole the urn, the supposed source of the Undertaker's strength, and used it to assault Paul Bearer, who was not seen again until SummerSlam. The feud came to a head at SummerSlam in a Rest In Peace match.\nThe six-man match at SummerSlam was originally supposed to be a mixed tag-team match between the team of Tatanka and Sherri Martel and the team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Luna Vachon. However, Luna broke her arm and Sherri left the WWF in July 1993, however, forcing the WWF to change the match. Two reasons have been given for Sherri's departure: her decision to enroll in cosmetology school and failed drug tests. As a result, Tatanka teamed with The Smoking Gunns and Bigelow teamed with The Headshrinkers. The Gunns and Headshrinkers were rivals in the tag team division but had no real storyline. The feud between Bigelow and Tatanka originated when Tatanka came to the help of Sherri, who had interrupted an interview with Bigelow. Subsequently, Bigelow ambushed Tatanka and cut some of the hair Tatanka had dyed red as a tribute to his Lumbee heritage.\nLex Luger's rivalry with Yokozuna began on July 4 at the Yokozuna Bodyslam Challenge on the deck of the USS Intrepid. After several wrestlers and other athletes attempted to body slam Yokozuna, Luger arrived in a helicopter. He was able to body slam Yokozuna, which led to a title shot at SummerSlam. To build support for Luger, the WWF had him ride across the country in a bus named the \"Lex Express\". Yokozuna's spokesperson, Jim Cornette, agreed to the match, but he made Lex Luger agree to two conditions. Luger would not receive a rematch if he lost, and he had to wear protective padding over the steel plate in his forearm.\nEvent.\nThe pay-per-view took place in front of a crowd of 23,954 at the Palace of Auburn Hills.\nBefore the event aired on PPV, \"The Rocket\" Owen Hart defeated longtime jobber Barry Horowitz in a dark match.\nThe first televised match was Razor Ramon versus Ted DiBiase. DiBiase got off to a quick start by attacking Ramon before the match began. Ramon quickly turned the match around with several clotheslines. DiBiase regained control before untying a turnbuckle cover. Ramon won the match after ramming DiBiase's head into the exposed turnbuckle and using the Razor's Edge to get the pin.\nThe Steiner Brothers were the audience favorites in the WWF Tag Team Championship match, as they were defending the belts in their hometown. Before the match began, The Heavenly Bodies attacked them. When the match began, the Bodies executed several double-team maneuvers on Rick Steiner. Scott tagged in and took control of the match. The Bodies soon regained the advantage, and Jim Cornette got involved by hitting Scott in the throat with a tennis racket. Rick tagged back in and hit several Steiner-Lines before Prichard attacked him with Cornette's tennis racket. Del Ray accidentally hit Prichard with a moonsault, however, allowing Scott to hit a Frankensteiner and Rick to get the pin.\nThe match between Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect began with a series of wrestling holds. The match remained primarily technical until Diesel distracted Perfect, allowing Michaels to superkick him in the face. Michaels worked on Perfect's injured back until Perfect took control of the match. After a series of attacks on Michaels, Perfect used the Perfect Plex. Diesel pulled him out of the ring and threw him into the steel ring steps, however, allowing Michaels to win by countout.\nIrwin R. Schyster remained in control for the majority of his match against the 1-2-3 Kid. Although the Kid hit several kicks, Schyster regained control every time. Schyster used his usual abdominal stretch while using the ring ropes for leverage before the Kid made a brief comeback by hitting a moonsault. Schyster hit a Write Off, however, and got the pin.\nBret Hart came to the ring for his match with Jerry Lawler. Lawler, however, appeared on crutches and claimed that he had been injured in a car accident. He announced that his court jester, Doink the Clown (portrayed by Matt Osborne), would wrestle Hart in his place. Doink threw a bucket of water on Bret's brother, Bruce Hart, prompting Bret to attack Doink outside of the ring. The match consisted of angry brawling until Doink slowed the pace with a couple of submission holds. After Doink missed a Whoopie Cushion attempt, Bret took full control of the match and locked Doink in the Sharpshooter. With Doink in the sharpshooter, Lawler then attacked Bret with a crutch, revealing that he was not injured and thus causing an unofficial disqualification (no official announcement was made). WWF President Jack Tunney came to the ring and had Howard Finkel announce that Lawler would be given a lifetime ban if he refused to compete in the scheduled match. The match between Lawler and Hart consisted almost exclusively of brawling. The two attacked each other with a milk pail and crutches and traded punches and kicks. Bret used Lawler's signature move, the piledriver, before putting him in the Sharpshooter. Lawler submitted, but Bret refused to release him for three and a half minutes. The referee then reversed his decision and gave the victory and title of \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation\" to Lawler.\nLudvig Borga dominated the majority of a squash match against Marty Jannetty. He attacked Jannetty immediately with a series of punches and knees. Jannetty managed a couple of brief comebacks but was unable to mount a serious offense. Borga used his strength to control the match and won the match by submission with a backbreaker.\nHarvey Wippleman was at ringside with the urn as the Undertaker faced Giant Gonzalez. The two wrestlers brawled, using the ring steps and steel chairs. Halfway through the match, Paul Bearer appeared, carrying a black wreath. He attacked Wippleman and took back the urn. The Undertaker quickly took control of the match, attacking Gonzalez with a flying clothesline to win by pinfall. After the match, Gonzalez turned on Wippleman and attacked him with a chokeslam.\nThe next match on the card was the Six-Man tag team match. The Headshrinkers' manager Afa interfered by attacking Billy Gunn outside the ring. At one point, Tatanka looked like he was gaining control, as he began his usual war dance. Bigelow kicked him in the back of the head, however, to end his momentum. Near the end of the match, Bigelow and the Headshrinkers each climbed the turnbuckles to attempt simultaneous diving headbutts, but Tatanka rolled out of the way. Tatanka seized the opportunity and pinned Samu for the win.\nBefore the main event, Kiotika Suzuki sang the Japanese national anthem. Akio Sato, formerly a member of The Orient Express, was the flag bearer for Yokozuna. Randy Savage then introduced Aaron Neville, who sang the American anthem.\nThe main event began with a stare down. Luger gained the early advantage and managed to knock Yokozuna down by kicking the ring ropes into Yokozuna's groin. Luger tried to bodyslam Yokozuna, but the sumo wrestler's weight was too much. Yokozuna knocked him out of the ring and choked him. Yokozuna had his manager, Mr. Fuji, throw him a salt bucket, which he used to attack Luger. Yokozuna wore Luger down, and after a brief comeback by the all-American, hit a leg drop on Luger and pulled him to the corner for a Banzai Drop. After Yokozuna missed, Luger succeeded in bodyslamming Yokozuna, and he attacked Mr. Fuji when the manager tried to get involved. Luger knocked Yokozuna out of the ring with a forearm smash, and followed this up by attacking Jim Cornette. Yokozuna was counted out, but he retained the title because championships only change hands only by pinfall or submission. Several faces came to the ring to celebrate with Luger as red, white and blue balloons fell from the ceiling to celebrate the victory.\nAftermath.\nThe SummerSlam match was DiBiase's final appearance as a WWF wrestler. He injured his neck and back in January 1994 and was forced to retire from wrestling. Meanwhile, Ramon received a push in Fall 1993 that led to the first of four Intercontinental championships.\nThe Heavenly Bodies did not become serious contenders to the tag team title, and the Steiners soon began a feud with The Quebecers, a new team in the WWF.\nShawn Michaels was suspended in late 1993 and forced to vacate the Intercontinental Championship, while Mr. Perfect began a feud with Diesel. The WWF planned to have Perfect and Diesel face each other as part of an elimination match at Survivor Series 1993, but Mr. Perfect was replaced by Randy Savage at the last minute. Mr. Perfect would not wrestle another pay per view match for the company until Royal Rumble 2002.\nThe match between Hart and Doink was significant for a couple of reasons. It marked Doink's final match as a heel, as he turned on Jerry Lawler shortly after the match. In addition, Matt Osborne, who had portrayed Doink since the character's creation, was fired that fall because of drug problems.\nThe feud between Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart remained unsettled and led to several storylines over the next two years. The final pay per view event featuring this feud was SummerSlam 1995, which saw Hart beat Lawler's \"dentist\" Isaac Yankem, D.D.S.\nBorga received a main event push after his SummerSlam match. After the event, he confronted Luger in the locker room. This began a feud that led to a match between the All-Americans and Foreign Fanatics at Survivor Series 1993.\nLuger continued to work as a main event wrestler, although he never won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. He competed in another match with Yokozuna at WrestleMania X after co-winning the 1994 Royal Rumble but was again unsuccessful in taking the belt from Yokozuna."

        "text": "The 1994 SummerSlam was the seventh annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 29, 1994, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, which had opened eleven days earlier. Eight matches were contested at the event, including one dark match held before the live broadcast.\nThe pay-per-view had two main events. The first pitted Owen Hart against his brother Bret Hart in a steel cage match. Bret won the match, but the storyline feud escalated after Owen and his brother-in-law Jim Neidhart attacked Bret after the match. The other main event saw The Undertaker defeat an impostor Undertaker (portrayed by Brian Lee). The undercard included a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Diesel and Razor Ramon, which Ramon won to regain the title. The other major angle going into SummerSlam was a feud in which Tatanka accused Lex Luger of joining the Million Dollar Corporation, a stable of heel wrestlers. This storyline turned out to be a swerve, as Tatanka was revealed to have secretly joined the corporation.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1994 event was the seventh event in the SummerSlam chronology and was held on Monday, August 29, 1994, at the United Center in Chicago, Illinois, which had opened eleven days earlier.\nStorylines.\nKwang and Adam Bomb were both managed by Harvey Wippleman. On May 28, 1994, a King of the Ring qualifying match between Bomb and the 1–2–3 Kid was televised on \"WWF Superstars\". The angle saw The Kid win after Kwang attempted to interfere on Bomb's behalf. Kwang accidentally spat green mist in Bomb's face, allowing the Kid to get the victory. Wippleman had Bomb and Kwang work as a tag team, but problems continued to develop between the two. The pair split after an argument cost them the match when they faced the team of the 1–2–3 Kid and \"Sparky\" Thurman Plugg. Bomb and Kwang faced each other on house shows leading up to their dark match at SummerSlam 1994.\nOne of the WWF's main storylines in 1994 was Ted DiBiase's creation of a stable known as the Million Dollar Corporation. That summer, DiBiase purchased the rights to Bam Bam Bigelow's contract from Bigelow's kayfabe girlfriend, Luna Vachon. Irwin R. Schyster, DiBiase's former partner in Money Inc., also joined the stable. Bigelow and Schyster were paired together to challenge for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The night before SummerSlam, The Headshrinkers dropped the belts to Diesel and Shawn Michaels. The match took place as scheduled, but the title was not on the line.\nIn early 1994, the WWF brought back the WWF Women's Championship, which had been deactivated in 1990, and pushed Alundra Blayze to win a championship tournament and defeat all challengers. Luna Vachon was brought in to challenge Blayze in a series of matches but was defeated each time. The storyline then saw Vachon bring in Bull Nakano, a Japanese female wrestler, to gain revenge and challenge Blayze.\nRazor Ramon had been feuding with Shawn Michaels since being pushed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship in late 1993. After defeating Shawn Michaels at WrestleMania X, Ramon dropped the belt to Diesel, Michaels' bodyguard. A rematch was scheduled for SummerSlam 1994. Ramon brought in NFL Hall of Famer Walter Payton to be his cornerman and help prevent Michaels from interfering.\nOn the July 11, 1994 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\", a major worked storyline began when Ted DiBiase announced that he had convinced Lex Luger to join the Million Dollar Corporation. Leading up to the pay-per-view, Tatanka confronted Lex Luger on several occasions, criticizing him for \"selling out\" to DiBiase. This led to a kayfabe admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase, but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation. He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument.\nJeff Jarrett and Mabel had no real feud going into SummerSlam. Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer, and Mabel portrayed a rapper. As a result, the WWF promoted the match as part of a \"rap versus country\" rivalry. There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on \"Monday Night Raw\" the week before SummerSlam. He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel.\nThe biggest storyline at SummerSlam began at the 1993 Survivor Series when Owen Hart was eliminated from the “Hart Brothers vs. Shawn Michaels and His Knights” elimination match due to miscommunication within the Hart team. Bret Hart was walking along the ring apron when Owen ran into him, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret kayfabe injured his knee, which eventually caused the referee to stop the match. Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. Bret jobbed to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay-per-view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Jim Neidhart, Bret and Owen's real-life brother-in-law, became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart. To settle the feud, Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam.\nAfter losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting the two Undertakers against each other. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen performed short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on \"Police Squad!\" and \"The Naked Gun\" films.\nEvent.\nIn a dark match before the pay-per-view broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, and that the belts would not be on the line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from \"The Naked Gun\", George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits trying to solve the mystery of the two Undertakers.\nPreliminary matches.\nIn the first televised match, The Headshrinkers were accompanied by managers Afa and Captain Lou Albano, and Bigelow and I.R.S. came to the ring with Ted DiBiase. Bigelow began the match by overpowering Fatu, but The Headshrinkers gained the advantage when Bigelow missed an Avalanche attempt. Schyster tagged in, and Bigelow pulled down the ropes to allow I.R.S. to throw Samu out of the ring. Outside the ring, Bigelow attacked Fatu with Schyster's briefcase. Samu performed a diving headbutt, but he was unable to get the pinfall. Ted DiBiase distracted the referee, which prompted Albano to protest. Meanwhile, Afa entered the ring to attack Bigelow. The referee saw Afa in the ring and awarded the match to Bigelow and Schyster as the result of a disqualification.\nThe following match saw Nakano challenging Blayze for the Women's Championship. Nakano used her size to perform such moves as leg drops and several submission holds. Blayze countered with aerial maneuvers like a hurricanrana and a spinning heel kick. Vachon got involved by choking Blayze while Nakano distracted the referee. The match ended when Nakano missed a diving leg drop, allowing Blayze to pin her for the win.\nEarly in the next match, Diesel threw Razor Ramon out of the ring, allowing Shawn Michaels to remove the turnbuckle padding. Walter Payton argued with Michaels about his interference, drawing the referee's attention. Michaels seized the opportunity to attack Ramon behind the referee's back. Diesel used two big boots and a series of submission holds to maintain the advantage. When he tried to throw Ramon into the unprotected turnbuckle, Payton pointed out the missing padding to the referee, who stood in the way to prevent the move. Soon after, Diesel tried to ram Ramon into the turnbuckle, but Ramon escaped and pushed Diesel into the turnbuckle. Ramon kept his momentum by performing a bulldog, a scoop slam, and a superplex. When Michaels tried to get involved again, Payton chased him around the outside of the ring. While the referee was distracted, Michaels entered the ring and tried to perform a superkick while Diesel held Ramon. Ramon moved, causing Michaels to kick Diesel instead. Ramon pinned Diesel to win the match and regain the Intercontinental Championship.\nThe match between Tatanka and Lex Luger began with the two wrestlers arguing. Luger relied on his power by punching and performing a shoulderblock. Tatanka focused on wearing Luger down with a wristlock and an armbar. After Luger performed a vertical suplex, Tatanka recovered and powerslammed Luger. Eventually, DiBiase came to ringside with a bag of money. As Luger yelled at DiBiase, Tatanka performed a schoolboy roll-up for the victory. After the match, Tatanka revealed that he had joined DiBiase's corporation. Tatanka attacked Luger and used the Million Dollar Dream, DiBiase's signature move, on Luger before leaving with DiBiase.\nMabel used his weight advantage to gain the early advantage in his match with Jeff Jarrett. Jarrett gained momentum when he tripped Mabel and performed a fist drop and two double axe handles from the ropes. On two occasions, Jarrett jumped on Mabel's back to perform sleeper holds, but Mabel backed him into the corner to escape both times. Mabel attempted to perform a splash from the second rope but missed. Jarrett attempted a sunset flip, which Mabel tried to counter by sitting on him. Jarrett moved out of the way and quickly pinned Mabel to win the match. In a reference to the 1994 Major League Baseball strike, Abe \"Knuckleball\" Schwartz was shown picketing in the crowd with an \"I'm on strike!\" sign.\nMain event matches.\nAs Owen Hart entered the steel cage for his WWF Championship match with his brother Bret, he immediately attacked Bret. Bret gained the advantage by performing a DDT. Owen kicked Bret in the head and tried to escape from the cage. The brothers both tried to climb over the cage several times, but neither would let the other escape. The match consisted mainly of brawling, including a couple of occasions when the two exchanged punches while standing on the top rope. Owen climbed over the cage, but Bret dragged him back in by pulling Owen's hair. Owen performed a piledriver on Bret, but Bret came back by throwing Owen into the bars of the cage. As Owen tried to escape, Bret suplexed him back into the ring from the top of the cage. Owen recovered and performed the Sharpshooter on Bret, but Bret escaped and used the same move on Owen. The match ended after Bret threw Owen's head into the steel cage and Owen's leg became trapped between the cage's bars. Bret climbed over the top of the cage and dropped to the floor to win the match and retain the title. After the match, Jim Neidhart attacked Davey Boy Smith, another brother-in-law of the Hart brothers. Neidhart padlocked the cage, and he and Owen attacked Bret until the other Harts could intervene.\nThe second main event match had Bearer's Undertaker fighting DiBiase's Undertaker. After DiBiase's Undertaker walked to the ring, Bearer appeared by himself while pushing a casket to the ring. He reached inside the casket and pulled out an urn, which had a light inside it when Bearer removed its lid. Bearer's Undertaker came to the ring and confronted DiBiase's Undertaker. Both wrestlers were wearing identical costumes, but Bearer's Undertaker wore purple gloves while DiBiase's wore grey. Bearer's Undertaker kicked his opponent out of the ring, where DiBiase's Undertaker tried to attack Bearer. DiBiase's Undertaker attempted to perform an arm twist ropewalk chop, but Bearer's Undertaker stopped him and performed the move. DiBiase's Undertaker then performed a chokeslam and a Tombstone piledriver. As he tried for another Tombstone piledriver, Bearer's Undertaker reversed it and performed the move. Bearer's Undertaker then performed two more Tombstone piledrivers before getting the pinfall victory. A group of people dressed as druids came to ringside, put DiBiase's Undertaker in the casket, and took the casket away.\nAftermath.\nDiBiase continued to manage his corporation until he left the WWF in 1996, but none of his wrestlers won a championship under his management. Tatanka and Luger continued to feud until they faced each other as part of an elimination match at the 1994 Survivor Series. Bigelow was later \"fired\" from the stable, leading to a feud with DiBiase's wrestlers.\nNakano was booked to win the Women's Championship on November 27, 1994. After Blayze won it back the following spring, Nakano disappeared from the WWF without mention and joined World Championship Wrestling.\nBret Hart was scheduled to defend his title against Bob Backlund at Survivor Series 1994. The stipulations stated that the only way to win was to force the person in your opponent's corner to throw a towel into the ring. Davey Boy Smith was in Bret's corner, while Owen Hart was in Backlund's corner. Smith chased Owen around the ring until Smith suffered a kayfabe injury, leaving nobody to throw in Bret's towel. As Backlund performed the crossface chickenwing on Bret, Owen pretended to show remorse. He convinced his mother, Helen, to throw in Bret's towel. After Backlund was awarded the belt, Owen celebrated his success in costing Bret the title.\nAt Survivor Series 1994, the storyline with Michaels and Diesel saw Michaels accidentally superkick Diesel once again. As a result, Diesel turned on Michaels, becoming a face and vacating the Tag Team Championship. Three days later, Bob Backlund put Diesel over by dropping his WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a match that lasted eight seconds. Diesel feuded with Michaels and defended the belt against him at WrestleMania XI.\nDiBiase's Undertaker was not seen again, but the wrestler portraying him, Brian Lee, returned to the WWF in 1997 as Chainz. Bearer's Undertaker gained revenge against Yokozuna at Survivor Series 1994 by defeating him in a casket match. To prevent interference, Chuck Norris was at ringside as a special guest enforcer.\nThis was the last SummerSlam to take place on a Monday."

        "text": "The 1995 SummerSlam was the eighth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 27, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A total of nine matches were contested at the event.\nThe main event that was for the WWF Championship competed between Diesel and King Mabel. Diesel retained the championship, pinning Mabel after performing a clothesline off the second rope. There were three matches on the undercard that had more build-up than other matches: The Undertaker defeated Kama in a Casket match; Bret Hart defeated Isaac Yankem by disqualification after Yankem and Jerry Lawler attacked Hart while Hart was in the \"hangman\" position. The third match on the undercard that had significant build-up was Shawn Michaels versus Razor Ramon in a feud for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. The two faced off in a Ladder match, with Michaels retaining the title.\nThe pay-per-view received a 0.9 buyrate, equivalent to approximately 205,000 buys in 1995 (1.0 equated to roughly 230,000 homes in the domestic market that year). Although this was up on the buyrate for the In Your House 2 pay-per-view which took place the previous month, the buyrate was down on the 1994 SummerSlam event, which received a 1.3 buyrate.\nSummerslam 1995 was the last WWF PPV before the Monday Night War era of September 4, 1995, to March 26, 2001, during which WWF's \"Raw\" and World Championship Wrestling's \"Nitro\" competed for ratings in a weekly Monday night time slot, which is now widely seen as the \"golden age\" of pro-wrestling.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1995 event was the eighth event in the SummerSlam chronology and the first to take place on a Sunday as the previous seven events aired on a Monday. It was scheduled to be held on August 27, 1995, at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\nStorylines.\nThe most prominent feud heading into the event was between WWF Champion Diesel and King of the Ring, King Mabel (accompanied by his manager and tag team partner, Sir Mo). King Mabel earned his title by winning the King of the Ring tournament. During Diesel's Lumberjack match with Sycho Sid at In Your House 2, King Mabel (who was one of the lumberjacks) intervened, tossing Diesel into the ring steps. Despite Mabel's interference, Diesel kept the title, pinning Sid after a big boot. On the August 7 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Diesel faced Sir Mo. Mabel appeared at ringside, distracting Diesel. Moments later, Shawn Michaels came ringside to support Diesel. After Diesel won the match, Mabel attacked him with a clothesline and a leg drop. Mabel then attacked Michaels. On the last \"Raw\" before SummerSlam, commentator Vince McMahon interviewed Diesel about his SummerSlam title defense. Halfway through the interview, Davey Boy Smith appeared and suggested he and Diesel team for a match against Men on a Mission (Mabel and Mo). During the match, Smith turned on Diesel and sided with Men on a Mission, leading to a three-on-one assault of the champion.\nThe feud between The Undertaker and Kama (a member of Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corporation) began at WrestleMania XI. The Undertaker's manager was Paul Bearer, and Kama's manager was Ted DiBiase. Undertaker was portrayed as the face, and Kama as the heel. At WrestleMania XI, during Undertaker's match with King Kong Bundy, Kama ran out to the ring, attacked Bearer, and stole the urn (an object which, in storylines, gives The Undertaker supernatural power) for DiBiase. Immediately afterward, Kama declared (in an interview with Jim Ross) his intention to melt down the urn. The urn was revealed to have become a gold necklace, first worn by Kama prior to his match with Scott Taylor on the April 10 episode of \"Raw\". On the April 23 episode of \"Action Zone\", The Undertaker defeated Sycho Sid, another member of The Million Dollar Corporation. On the May 7 episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\", a black wreath was left at ringside for Kama. Kama attacked the wreath and, after defeating Buck Zumhofe, stuffed part of it into Zumhofe's mouth. Another black wreath was left at ringside for Kama on the June 12 \"Raw\". After defeating jobber David Haskins, Kama again attacked the wreath, only to realise it was a mannequin. Both The Undertaker and Kama participated in the 1995 King of the Ring tournament. On the pay-per-view, a black wreath was ringside for the whole of Kama's quarterfinal match with Shawn Michaels, which ended in a draw. Toward the end of The Undertaker's quarterfinal contest with Mabel, Undertaker was thrown into the referee. While the referee was down, Kama interfered by kicking Undertaker in the face. Mabel followed up with a leg drop, pinning Undertaker to win the match. The Undertaker chased Kama backstage after the bout. The two continued to wrestle together in matches at house shows, with the two facing each other in preparation for their SummerSlam bout. Wreaths continued to be left ringside during Kama's matches, and Kama continued to attack them. On the August 21, 1995 \"Raw\", (storyline) WWF president Gorilla Monsoon announced the match between Undertaker and Kama would be a casket match.\nAn undercard feud involved Shawn Michaels and the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Michaels had won the title by pinning Jeff Jarrett at \"In Your House 2\". At that event, Michaels was also a \"lumberjack\" in the WWF Title match between Diesel and Sycho Sid. He performed a double axe handle off the top rope onto Sid on the outside of the ring, helping Diesel retain the title. A few months prior, Sid had powerbombed Michaels three times, after Shawn blamed Sid for costing him the WWF World Heavyweight Title at WrestleMania XI sidelining him for six weeks with injuries. On the July 24 \"Raw\", Sid vowed revenge on Michaels. That night, commentator Jerry Lawler stated his own desire for a shot at Michaels' title. A match between Sid and Michaels was scheduled for SummerSlam. However, the match was suddenly scrapped soon after. Michaels would now defend the Intercontinental Championship in a ladder match against Razor Ramon, despite a lack of any onscreen buildup. On the August 7 \"Raw\", Michaels attempted to attack Lawler, but was restrained by officials. Michaels wrestled Lawler on the August 14 \"Raw\". Sid attempted to interfere in the match with a clothesline, but Michaels ducked and hit Sid with a superkick. Sid and Lawler regained the upper hand, and Sid chokeslammed Michaels. Razor Ramon ran in and assisted Michaels in clearing the ring of his attackers. Michaels and Razor then had a staredown, which led to a brawl. Razor came out on top. Despite being removed from SummerSlam, Sid was granted a future title shot, against whoever would be champion on the September 11 episode of \"Raw\".\nBret Hart had been feuding with Jerry Lawler for two years when they met at King of the Ring. Hart won the match and, per the stipulation, Lawler was forced to kiss Hart's feet, despite Hakushi's attempt to stop it. The following night on \"Raw\", a vignette aired, showing Lawler visiting his dentist, Isaac Yankem, D.D.S., to have his teeth cleansed of foot smell. Yankem revealed to Lawler he used to be a professional wrestler. This began a storyline of Lawler attempting to avenge his loss to Hart. Over the following weeks, more vignettes from Yankem's office aired. They showed him treating his patients, while Lawler asked them which wrestlers they liked and disliked. On the July 24 \"Raw\", Hart beat Hakushi. After the bout, Hart assaulted and piledrove Hakushi's manager, Shinja. Yankem and Hart did not have any direct interaction before their SummerSlam match.\nThe WWF Women's Championship feud started on the April 3 episode of \"Raw\". Moments after winning the title from Bull Nakano, Alundra Blayze was attacked by an unknown woman (later introduced as Bertha Faye). The attack sidelined Blayze with a broken nose. Faye, managed by Harvey Whippleman, had her debut match on the April 24 \"Raw\", squashing La Pantera Serena. Blayze made her \"Raw\" return on May 29, stating she was cleared to wrestle in an interview with Vince McMahon. Faye and Whippleman responded with their own interview on the June 3 \"Superstars of Wrestling\". Their SummerSlam match was announced on the August 7 episode of \"Raw\".\nEvent.\nThe first match to air was between Hakushi and The 1-2-3 Kid. Hakushi got the early advantage after hitting a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker. Both wrestlers performed multiple high spots. Late on, The Kid avoided a Diving headbutt, and followed with a series of offensive moves. The Kid attempted to perform his finisher, a spinning crescent kick, but Hakushi countered it into the Nenbutsu Bomb and pinned him.\nHunter Hearst Helmsley faced Bob Holly in the second match. This was Helmsley's WWF pay-per-view wrestling debut. Toward the end of the bout, Holly gained the upper hand with a series of dropkicks. He attempted to toss Helmsley into the corner, but Helmsley reversed it, then hit his Pedigree finisher and made the pin .\nA tag team match was next. The Smoking Gunns (Bart Gunn and Billy Gunn) faced The Blu Brothers (Jacob Blu and Eli Blu), with their manager Uncle Zebekiah at ringside. The Blu Brothers held the advantage for the majority of the match, making quick tags to work over Billy. Billy eventually made the hot tag to Bart, who gained the immediate advantage but was booted in the face by Jacob. Bart regained the advantage, pushing Jacob into Eli. The Gunns followed up with their Sidewinder finisher for the pin.\nThe next match was between Barry Horowitz and Skip of the Bodydonnas (managed by Sunny). Horowitz had defeated Skip in several matches shortly before SummerSlam. This match was both competitor and Sunny's first appearances on a WWF pay-per-view. Horowitz took control early and kept it for much of the match. Multiple illegal interferences from Sunny momentarily gave Skip the upper hand. Eventually, Hakushi came to ringside. He distracted Skip long enough for Horowitz to score a roll up pinfall and win the match. \nThe following matchup was for the Women's Championship. Bertha Faye (managed by Harvey Whippleman) challenged Alundra Blayze. Momentum went back and forth several times. Eventually Faye was able to powerbomb Blayze and pin her, winning the Women's Championship.\nNext was the casket match between Kama (with manager Ted DiBiase) and The Undertaker (with manager Paul Bearer). The Undertaker took the early lead. Kama fought his way out of the casket several times and reversed the momentum with a leaping fist from the top rope. Kama then spent most of the match on the offensive. At one point, the Undertaker clotheslined Kama and both men went over the top rope into the casket and the lid shut but the match continued until a winner was decided. The Undertaker eventually ducked a clotheseline and choke slammed, then Tombstone Pile-driver, and then rolled Kama into the casket, closed the lid, and was declared the winner. \nThe next match was between Isaac Yankem and Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart. This was Yankem's (later Kane's) debut and first WWF pay-per-view appearance. Yankem used several power moves to gain an early advantage against Hart. A missed charge to the turnbuckle flipped the momentum into Hart's favor. Yankem was eventually able to catch Hart midair and slam him down upon the top rope. After some time Yankem fell out of the ring. Hart took a running dive on top of him and then slammed his head into the steps. Hart applied the sharpshooter but Yankem was able to grab the ropes to break the hold. Jerry Lawler left his broadcast position to distract Hart, permitting Yankem to get the upper hand and slammed Hart into the stairs. However, Hart was able to throw Yankem from the top rope as he attempted a high risk maneuver. Additional interference from Lawler eventually led to a disqualification for Yankem. However Hart ended with his head twisted in the ropes and Lawler and Yankem pulling on his feet to choke him. \nThe penultimate match of the night was a ladder match between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship. This was a rematch from their highly rated ladder match at WrestleMania 10. By this point in time Michaels had become a fan favorite, and so this was a rare matchup between two face superstars. In the midst of some back and forth both contenders went for their finishing moves but both times they were avoided. Razor was able to go out and retrieve the ladder but while trying to climb it Michaels was able to kick him off. The match went back and forth with both wrestlers climbing the ladder but being knocked off. Ramon began a strategy of attacking and injuring Michaels' left leg, twisting it in the ladder and dropping his boot and the ladder on it many times. Michaels eventually took the advantage with a suplex off the ladder and then several aerial attacks from the ladder. However when Michaels went for a splash from the very top of the ladder Ramon moved out of the way. Eventually Ramon was able to grab Michaels as he was climbing the ladder and convert it into a Razor's Edge. Razor was unable to capitalize, and when he went for a second Razor's Edge Michaels was able to backtoss him out of the ring. Michaels was then able to climb the ladder and take down the belt, winning the match. Ramon came back in, presented Michaels with the belt, and shook his hand.\nThe final match was between King Mabel and Big Daddy Cool Diesel for the World Championship Belt. Mabel took the advantage early. At one point Mabel sit-splashed onto Diesel's back, injuring him in reality. Eventually the referee was knocked down. Sir Mo and Mabel then double teamed Diesel. Lex Luger came out from the backstage to help but ended up getting hit by Diesel in the fray and knocked back out. Eventually Luger was able to remove Mo from the match. Diesel was able to win with a rare aerial attack of a clotheseline off the second rope.\nAftermath.\nThe night after SummerSlam was New Fall Season that aired on August 28, 1995 (taped on September 7, 1995) with \"Raw on Roof\" from Titan Towers following Superstars on September 9 then Raw on September 11\nLex Luger made his second to last appearance on WWF television in the main event (preventing Sir Mo from further interfering and that lead to a six man tag match with Sir Mo, Mabel and Sid in losing fashion to Lex, Shawn Michaels &amp; The Undertaker that aired on New Fall Season on September 11, 1995 as a dark match before the show, and marked the end of The Allied Powers, making this Lex's final appearance. He rejoined World Championship Wrestling the next week.\nDiesel defended the WWF Championship against Owen Hart, Yokozuna, and Davey Boy Smith, before losing it to Bret Hart at Survivor Series.\nThe Undertaker's feud with the Million Dollar Corporation ended, and he began to feud with King Mabel.\nBret Hart continued to feud with Jerry Lawler and Isaac Yankem until the October 16, 1995 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", where Hart defeated Yankem in a steel cage match."

        "text": "The 1996 SummerSlam was the ninth annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 18, 1996, at the Gund Arena (now called Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse) in Cleveland, Ohio in the United States. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one match on the \"Free for All\" pre-show.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1996 event was the ninth event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 18, 1996, at the Gund Arena in Cleveland, Ohio.\nFaarooq Asad had been scheduled to face Ahmed Johnson in a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at the event, but the match did not take place as Johnson was legitimately injured.\nEvent.\nThe opening bout, which aired on the \"Free for All\" portion of the broadcast, was a singles match between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Yokozuna. The match ended when the top rope broke as Yokozuna attempted a \"Banzai Drop\" (seated senton), enabling Austin to pin him for an upset victory.\nTodd Pettengill hosted the \"Bikini Beach Blast-Off\" party during the Free for All, where a pool was set up for everyone. Guests included Sunny, Sable, Marc Mero, The Smoking Gunns, Marlena, Goldust, T.L. Hopper, Who, Jerry Lawler, The Bushwhackers, Aldo Montoya, Hunter Hearst Helmsley, and Shawn Michaels.\nThe second bout, and the first bout to air on the pay-per-view proper, was a singles match between Owen Hart and Savio Vega. During the match, Hart wore an orthopedic cast on his left arm. The match ended when Hart hit Vega with his cast then applied the Sharpshooter, defeating Vega by submission. Following the match, Justin Hawk Bradshaw attacked Vega.\nThe third bout saw WWF Tag Team Champions The Smoking Gunns defend their titles against The Bodydonnas, The Godwinns, and The New Rockers in a four-way elimination match. The Bodydonnas were the first team eliminated after Marty Jannetty tripped Zip, enabling Billy Gunn to pin him. The New Rockers were the next team eliminated when Henry O. Godwinn pinned Leif Cassidy following a \"Slop Drop\" (reverse DDT). The Smoking Gunns went on to win the match and retain their titles when Bart Gunn gave Phineas I. Godwinn a diving double axe handle, enabling Billy Gunn to pin him. Following the match, The Smoking Gunn's manager Sunny unveiled a large picture of herself.\nThe fourth bout was a singles match between The British Bulldog and Sycho Sid. Sid won the bout by pinning British Bulldog following a chokeslam and powerbomb.\nThe fifth bout was a singles match between Goldust and Marc Mero. Goldust won the bout by pinfall following a \"Curtain Call\" (lifting inverted DDT).\nThe sixth bout was a singles match between Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler. Lawler won the bout by pinfall after hitting Roberts with a bottle of Jim Beam whiskey. Following the match, Lawler poured whisky onto Roberts until being stopped by Mark Henry.\nThe penultimate bout was the first ever Boiler Room Brawl, Mankind’s specialty match. The heel Mankind would be facing The Undertaker, whom Mankind had been harassing and assaulting at random for months. Mankind would often hang out in the darkness of an arena’s boiler room (also known as a mechanical room), which was often hot and dusty, and where most of the arena’s internal infrastructure was. This match first featured The Undertaker entering the Gund Arena’s boiler room to seek out his arch-enemy, but Mankind struck first and they then proceeded to brawl for 30 minutes in the boiler room, the arena’s corridors, the entrance ramp and finally the ring, where Paul Bearer was waiting for one of the wrestlers to take his urn, which was the winning objective of the match. Bearer turned on his long-time protege, The Undertaker, to align himself with Mankind.\nThe main event saw Shawn Michaels defend the WWF Championship against Vader. Vader originally won the match twice, first by countout (after he press-slammed Michaels onto the guard rail) and then by disqualification (when Michaels struck Vader repeatedly with Cornette's tennis racket), but because WWF championships can only change hands by pinfall or submission, Cornette demanded that the match restart both times. WWF President Gorilla Monsoon allowed this when Michaels agreed. Michaels went on to pin Vader after hitting him with a moonsault, thus retaining his title.\nAftermath.\nThe main event feud between Shawn Michaels and Vader was supposed to continue until that year's Survivor Series event with Vader capturing the WWF Championship from the champion Michaels. However, due to several botches on the part of Vader during the match, Michaels voiced his frustrations about the match's execution to backstage where Vader was eventually stripped of his push. Michaels would eventually lose the title to Sycho Sid at Survivor Series."

        "text": "The 1997 SummerSlam (marketed as SummerSlam: Hart &amp; Soul) was the 10th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 3, 1997, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Seven matches were contested at the event. This event was second to be held in New Jersey with the first previous event in 1989.\nThe show also included the culmination of a contest in partnership with Discovery Zone with a $1 million prize which nobody actually won. It included several attempted calls where nobody was home. The contest ended after a potential winner failed to guess the proper key to the casket containing the prize money.\nThe event also marked the first WWF pay-per-view appearance of Michael Cole, and the last WWF pay-per-view appearance of Todd Pettengill, who left the company before returning to host segments and matches of the WWE DVD and Blu-ray release \"The Best of In Your House: Pay-Per-View Classics 1995-1999\" in 2013.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1997 event was the 10th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 3, 1997, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey.\nStorylines.\nSummerSlam 1997 featured professional wrestling matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines that were played out on \"Raw Is War\" and other World Wrestling Federation (WWF) television programs. Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension, and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.\nThe featured rivalry heading into the event involved WWF Champion The Undertaker and Bret Hart. On the July 7 episode of \"Raw is War\" at Edmonton, Alberta, Hart was announced as the number one contender for the WWF Championship. In an interview with Vince McMahon, Hart said that if he did not win the title at SummerSlam, he would not wrestle on American soil again. The next week, Shawn Michaels, Hart's nemesis, requested Vince McMahon to be a part of SummerSlam. On the July 21 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Hart, his brother Owen, and his brother-in-law The British Bulldog (The Hart Foundation), challenged three American wrestlers into a flag match. Michaels was announced as a special referee for the main event at SummerSlam, and in response to the announcement, Hart attacked Michaels and McMahon. Later, the Hart Foundation defeated the American team that contained the WWF Tag Team Champions Stone Cold Steve Austin and Dude Love, with the Undertaker, where the Hart Foundation won thanks to an interference from Brian Pillman. The next week, Hart challenged The Patriot, a match where Hart lost thanks to an interference from Michaels. After the match, the referees prevented Hart from attacking Michaels while the Undertaker watched from the entrance ramp.\nA predominant feud entering the event featured WWF Intercontinental Champion Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin. On July 6, on the pay-per-view, Hart managed to pin Austin in a five-on-five match. The day after it, Austin attacked Hart while he was singing the Canadian national anthem. At the same night, Austin told Vince McMahon that if he did not win the title from Hart at SummerSlam, he will kiss Hart's ass. The next week, Austin teamed up with Dude Love to win the vacant tag team titles in a match with Hart and the British Bulldog. On the July 21 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Hart's team managed to defeat Austin's team at a three on three flag match. The next week, Hart attacked Austin during a WWF Tag Team Championship match against The Godwinns, counting him out. After the match, Austin attacked Hart.\nAnother rivalry heading into event featured the WWF European Champion The British Bulldog and Ken Shamrock. The two were at opposing teams of the Canadian Stampede pay-per-view. On the July 14 episode of \"Raw Is War\", the Bulldog said that if he lost at SummerSlam, he would eat a can of dog food right after the match. The next week, the Bulldog attacked Shamrock during a match with Vader, powerslamming him on the steel ramp, and making him lose the match via countout. The next week, Bulldog and Shamrock competed in an arm wrestling contest, but as Shamrock was about to win, the Bulldog headbutted him, hit him with a steel chair and poured a can of dog food over him.\nSteve Austin incident.\nThe event is perhaps best remembered for the WWF Intercontinental Championship match between Owen Hart and Stone Cold Steve Austin that featured Hart delivering a botched piledriver that legitimately injured Austin's neck and temporarily paralyzed him, leaving him with many years of neck issues and potentially derailing the WWF's momentum in the Monday Night War during a time when the WWF could ill afford to lose any more ground to World Championship Wrestling.\nIn his audio book autobiography, Austin revealed that he and Hart were planning on the spots in the match when Austin (who was booked to win the match and the title) suggested to Hart about performing a piledriver as a false finish, under the condition that it was the knee-drop \"Tombstone piledriver\" variant used by The Undertaker as opposed to the more common variant of landing on his butt. Hart said he was more comfortable performing the latter variant but assured Austin that he would not hurt him. Coming off a critically-acclaimed feud with Hart's brother Bret Hart (who gained a reputation of not injuring opponents), Austin obliged.\nHowever, at the planned spot Hart wasn't able to protect Austin's head, leading to Austin to break his neck and temporarily suffer paralysis. (In an ironic bit of foreshadowing, Jim Ross mentioned several times on commentary about Austin's history of neck problems prior to the botched move.) Austin informed referee Earl Hebner that he could not move and that Hart should not touch him. Once Hebner informed Hart, he started buying time for Austin to recover by taunting the crowd that Austin was about to \"kiss his ass\" (per the pre-match stipulation if Austin did not win the title) until Austin had recovered enough to perform the \"worst roll-up ever\" to end the match early and with the scheduled finish of Austin winning the Intercontinental Championship.\nThe injury left Austin sidelined for weeks, during a time when the WWF could ill-afford to have their biggest rising star off of television during their lowest point in the Monday Night War, when WCW was in the midst of an 83 week winning streak with \"WCW Monday Nitro\" beating out \"Raw is War\". While Austin was able to recover, he continued to suffer neck issues and was written off television at the 1999 Survivor Series to undergo neck surgery, eventually forcing him to retire at age 38 in 2003.\nAustin has since stated that his neck is in good shape and he is in zero pain after his neck surgery was successful. The accident was a source of backstage conflict between the two men, but Austin ultimately forgave Hart, and paid tribute to him on \"Raw Is War\" the night after Hart fell to his death at Over the Edge 1999. However, Austin did admit that he does regret that he and Hart were not able to fully discuss the incident at hand before Hart's unexpected death.\nThe botch, while initially appearing fatal for the WWF in the Monday Night War, ultimately proved to be a speed bump. However, the WWF still took preventative action, legitimately banning the piledriver in 2000. The Undertaker and Kane were grandfathered to keep using it, as the two were proven safe with the move (though Kane would eventually switch to the much safer chokeslam as his finishing move), while Rikishi began to use the \"Banzai drop\" (co-opted by his real-life cousin Yokozuna) as his finishing move. Subsequent wrestlers who used variations of the piledriver on the independent circuit such as Kevin Owens dropped the move from their moveset upon signing with the now-WWE.\nReception.\nIn 2006, J.D. Dunn of \"411Mania\" gave the event a rating of 5.0 [Not So Good], stating, \"It was headed into \"worst PPV ever\" territory until the final two matches. The WWF was trying hard to get things going during the summer of '97, but it would take another year before they started to win the war with WCW. Too much mediocre crap in the early matches is a big part of the reason why. Oddly enough, Austin's injury would turn him into more of a talker for the next few months, and he would get even *more* over with the fans. Plus, it led to the anti-authoritarian character that made all that money against Vince McMahon.\nMild thumbs up for historical reasons and for Foley, Hart, Austin &amp; Undertaker.\"\nThe event contained several extended promo segments that did not appear to evoke much crowd reaction. For example, then-governor of New Jersey Christine Todd Whitman was given significant time on the microphone and a championship belt, for lowering taxes on professional wrestling events. In another segment, Todd Pettengill spent significant time calling several people on the phone with no one answering, as he stared at a list of names Tammy Lynn Sytch was holding under her cleavage, for a purported million-dollar sweepstakes promotion."

        "text": "The 1998 SummerSlam (marketed as SummerSlam: Highway to Hell) was the 11th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 30, 1998, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Eleven matches were contested at the event, including three on the \"Sunday Night Heat\" pre-show.\nThe main event was a Singles match for the WWF Championship between Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker. Austin won the match via pinfall after a Low Blow and Stunner to retain the WWF Championship. The main match on the undercard featured a ladder match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Triple H and The Rock, which Triple H went on to win the Intercontinental Championship. This SummerSlam was the notable for the pay-per-view in-ring debut of Edge. It was also notable for being the most-bought SummerSlam Pay-Per-View in the event's history, with 700,000 buys.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1998 event was the 11th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 30, 1998, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York.\nStorylines.\nThe main storyline heading into the event revolved around WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker. At King of the Ring, Austin had lost his championship in the inaugural First Blood match, however he won it back the next night on \"Raw is War\". \nThe pay-per-view match ended in controversy though; Kane's partner Mankind came to the ring, followed by Undertaker, whose attempted chair shot to Mankind was mistimed and instead met Austin, opening him up and costing him the match. Until this point, Undertaker had shown nothing but disdain for his younger brother since his debut the previous October but he explained on \"Raw\" that he would not sit idly by while his brother set himself on fire (the stipulation of the First Blood match should Kane lose.) On the July 6th episode of \"Raw is War\", Vince McMahon announced a SummerSlam #1 Contender's match between Kane, Undertaker and Mankind. When Undertaker did not appear the match was started anyway with Kane savagely beating Mankind and winning much to the delight of McMahon, however mid celebration Kane ripped off his mask to reveal it was actually Undertaker in disguise. \nMcMahon became obsessed with proving the brothers were conspiring against Austin and tried to prove this by putting champion and contender in a match for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Fully Loaded. McMahon could not bait Undertaker though as the team won the match but did not unify as a team for long, defending the titles until August 10, losing in a four corners tag match to Kane and Mankind. The next week, Austin arrived on \"Raw\" in a hearse and challenged Undertaker to a fight; at the end of the show Undertaker came to the ring and Austin followed, however when Undertaker fully faced Austin it became apparent it was actually Kane in his brother's attire, using his hair to hide his mask previously. Austin threw Kane in the back of the hearse but when he went to drive away, Undertaker appeared in the driver's seat and drove his brother away, thus revealing the alliance between the two, cemented by a beat down on Paul Bearer the following week, and greatly reducing the champion’s chances at SummerSlam.\nThe second storyline heading into the event involved The Rock defending the WWF Intercontinental Championship against Triple H in a Ladder Match. Last month at , Rock and Triple H fought for the Intercontinental Championship in a two out of three falls match which ended in a no contest. The two continued their rivalry while leading up their respective factions Nation of Domination and D-Generation X. On the August 17 episode of \"Raw is War\", DX and the Nation fought in a street fight which the Nation won when Rock rammed a ladder in Triple H's face causing him to bleed from the mouth. Backstage after the match, Triple H challenged Rock to a Ladder match for the Intercontinental title at SummerSlam. On the August 23 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", Rock accepted the challenge.\nEvent.\nD'Lo Brown defended his European Championship against Val Venis, initially showing respect to him when the two slapped hands. However, Brown would soon use his chest protector to gain leverage over Venis when the latter made an early advantage. Despite the protector, Venis still managed to retain some offensive momentum, legsweeping Brown out of the turnbuckle leading the champion to escape outside the ring. The two then embarked on a number of Irish whip maneuvers with frequent reversals, Venis perhaps taking Brown down more often. Despite flooring Venis with an Irish whip to the turnbuckle, Brown lost any advantage by gesturing to the crowd, though Venis' comeback was short-lived. Brown kept Venis mostly low, making many ground attacks from a standing position and the top ropes, often trying pins in between then switching tactics by applying a Texas cloverleaf. Rather than keep the pressure though, Brown let go and missed a senton bomb from the second rope, allowing Venis to recover and fight back with knees to the chest and elbow attacks. Venis tried to capitalize on this with his finisher, the money shot, but as Brown began to stand up Venis opted for a dropkick instead, however he was met with the grip of Brown who turned it into a Sky High instead but still Venis would not be pinned, similarly even after a DDT. Brown tried a high flying move of his own but Venis caught him mid air for a scoop slam. Despite subduing Brown with a double-armed suplex and a slam, Brown managed to get his knees up and after this attempted a powerbomb. The first powerbomb was unsuccessful though, Brown unable to flip Venis onto his shoulders and subsequently dropping him onto his head; the second though was a successful running powerbomb but rather than pin him, Brown attempted, and missed, the Lo Down. Venis then pulled off Brown's chest protector, putting it on himself and causing the referee to try to pull it off him. As Venis climbed the turnbuckle the referee accidentally pulled the ropes, causing Venis to land on his crotch. He still managed a Manhattan drop on Brown though, trying to climb the turnbuckle again with the referee still pulling at the chest protector. This time Venis shoved the referee to the ground, causing him to lose the match via disqualification; after the match he slammed the referee and landed the Moneyshot.\nThe Oddities, welcomed to the ring by Insane Clown Posse singing their music, lived up to their title when Golga, having had his head smashed against the turnbuckle by Taka Michinoku, headbanged voluntarily. After pouring water into Yamaguchi-San's shoe, the match began in earnest with Funaki being thrown around the ring by Kurrgan and despite the entire team illegally attacking Kurrgan, holding his arms, he still managed to kick away Funaki and toss the others restraining his hand. When Giant Silva was tagged in, all of Kaientai fled the ring, regrouping outside before Dick Togo was sent into the ring but similar to before the entire team soon ganged up on him but Silva piled all four of them into the turnbuckle, crushing them back into the padding before Irish whipping them into the opposite corner and then tossing Taka over the top rope, falling onto the other three members. Golga was the first Oddity brought to the floor, with a double slam by Funaki and Mens Teioh which was followed up by four big splashes by all members. Kai En Tai followed suite with four running elbow drops but a four-man Irish whip was met with a clothesline that took all of them out. With Kurrgan tagged in, the four tried to attack him but Kurrgan and Silva choked all four between the two of them. Yamaguchi tried to attack Kurrgan from behind but Luna Vachon scoop slammed him and all four of Kai En Tai received a chokeslam in unison and Golga covered all four of them to pick up the pin count.\nThe Hair match saw Jeff Jarrett's accomplices, Southern Justice, sent to the back by Commissioner Slaughter whilst Howard Finkel accompanied X-Pac to the ring, performing the signature crotch chops. The match moved both in and out of the ring early on, with Jarrett rushing X-Pac's open legs onto the ring post, leaving him almost to be counted out. When he returned to the ring, Jarrett continued his dominance with basic punching and Irish whips to the turnbuckle. X-Pac returned with a desperate swinging DDT allowing him to take some time to recover, but his attacking maneuvers were met with a sleeper hold. An attempt to put Jarrett in the sleeper hold saw him lifted from behind onto the turnbuckle but X-Pac used this to his advantage, spinning round into a crossbody which missed contact with his opponent. With both men on the floor, Jarrett applied his figure four leg lock in the middle of the ring, which X-Pac struggled to counter by turning over, eventually making it to the rope after a minute or so. Jarrett tried to lock the submission again but X-Pac kicked him from behind into the corner, catching him with a backdrop as Jarrett stumbled out. Despite a spinning heel kick and bronco buster, Jarrett was still able to land a diving crossbody, though X-Pac rolled it in his favor. Finkel climbed onto the apron to complain of a low blow attempt, when Jarrett turned back to the ring X-Pac landed an X Factor. Southern Justice appeared from the back, but X-Pac ducked El Kabong from Dennis Knight, grabbing the guitar and hitting Jarrett with it while the referee pushed Southern Justice out of the ring. Once the pinfall was made, fellow Degenerates, New Age Outlaws rushed to ringside with chairs to chase away Southern Justice while The Headbangers and Darren Drozdov helped hold Jarrett in his chair while he had his hair removed, though he escaped the ring before he was completely shaved bald.\nSable arrived to the ring and introduced her mystery tag team partner, with Edge coming through the crowd to make his pay-per-view debut. Marc Mero and Edge were the initial opponents though Mero soon tagged in Jacqueline, however she immediately tagged Mero back when confronted by Sable. On the outside Jacqueline pulled at Edge's feet while running, allowing Mero to take the advantage and, with the referee distracted, choked him on the bottom rope. Mero attempted a TKO but Edge swung round to secure a DDT and with both men down they crawled to tag in their prospective female partners. Sable instantly scooped Jacqueline and punched her before chasing her around the ring and back in. Inside the ring Mero tried to subdue Sable, but he was lowblowed and then he almost got a Sable Bomb, but Jacqueline saved Mero this allowed Jacqueline to take some advantage but Sable soon turned the tables back in her favor, landing a TKO on Jacqueline. Mero pulled Sable off the pin and while distracted, was double teamed by both opponents. Jacqueline accidentally hit her partner though, letting Sable tag in Edge who made a running suicide leap onto Mero, before whipping him into the steel steps and spanking Jacqueline on the walkway. A pinning attempt after a super neckbreaker was put on hold when Mero's partner put his feet on the bottom rope. Once again the two accidentally collided, when Edge ducked out of the way leaving Jacqueline on the outside of the ring. When Mero went to the top rope, Edge reversed leaving him sitting on the turnbuckle and then tagged in Sable who delivered a frankensteiner. Edge then went to pin Mero but leapt off him when he saw Jacqueline flying for a splash, leading the two to collide once again. Sable and Edge then whipped their respective opponents into the corner, with Mero falling out of it and then Jacqueline falling head first onto his crotch. Edge then grabbed Sable by her legs and planted her face first onto Mero to secure the pin.\nThe Lion's Den match, which took place in a separate theatre within Madison Square Garden in front of a special crowd, was contested in a pseudo-circular polygon cage, with steel wire and no ropes approximately ten feet high. After both competitors entered the den, the door was chained shut. The match began with Owen Hart being driven into the steel wall and then slammed into the ground, though Ken Shamrock would receive the same treatment. Shamrock then backdropped Hart and picked up to hold him in submission around his head. Though Hart threw Shamrock into the wall, Shamrock instantly retaliated with a clothesline and proceeded to pull off Hart's shirt and use it to choke Hart from behind, bringing him down with a snapmare using the cloth and continuing to pull at his neck. As Hart stood up, Shamrock jumped into the cage and jumped back off it, higher, to crossbody his opponent. After throwing Hart into the wall again, Shamrock soon felt the wrath of the den as he was driven into the metal frames that secured the chain. Hart caught Shamrock's foot, but the latter followed through with an enzuigiri negating either advantage. As the two returned to their feet it became an exchange of punches before Shamrock again used the cage to aid him into a flying shoulder barge, but the second time he did this Hart caught him and slammed him into the mat and used the advantage to lock in the Sharpshooter. Shamrock slowly crawled to the cage and used his fingers to climb up, building pressure on his own legs but making it awkward for Hart to sustain the hold. Despite breaking out Hart managed to catch Shamrock, bending him backwards with his arm wrapped around Shamrock's neck. Shamrock broke free by walking up the steel and flipping over the back of Hart, tripping him with a toe hold that allowed him to utilize an arm bar submission before applying his ankle lock that forced Dan Severn to walk away in disgust and Hart to tap out.\nWith Kane absent from the arena, the falls count anywhere match for the WWF Tag Team Championship became a de facto handicap match. New Age Outlaws brought out a dumpster full of weapons, alluding to an incident in February where they had locked Mankind, as Cactus Jack, and Chainsaw Charlie in a dumpster and thrown it off the stage. Billy Gunn ran into the ring and met with a baking tray to his head from Mankind before the two had a sword fight of sorts, with a steel chair. Despite Mankind taking the advantage from this, the tandem attacks of baking sheets to the head subdued Mankind until he was caught in the ropes. After taking more weapons to the head, Mankind managed to toss Gunn over his back to the outside and fought Road Dogg into the corner. When Mankind went back out the ring to continue his assault on Gunn, though, the handicap caught up with him and he was thrown against the dumpster. Road Dogg opened up a table in the corner but Mankind managed to reverse the Irish whip, forcing Gunn through it. After a double team elevated neckbreaker did not dispatch him, he suffered a double team powerbomb through two chairs and again this did not keep Mankind down (although after Mankind kicked out, the Outlaws music briefly played) but finally a spiked piledriver onto the championship belt was enough to keep him down. After winning, Outlaws put Mankind in the dumpster and closed the lid. Whilst the Outlaws celebrated, the lid of the dumpster opened and Kane stood up, picking up a sledgehammer and throwing it down on an unseen Mankind inside the dumpster.\nTriple H entered the ring behind the DX Band, performing Break It Down live, finishing with Chris Warren on Triple H's shoulders and the band throwing the drums apart. The WWF Intercontinental Championship Ladder match began with Triple H clotheslining The Rock to the floor and striking him on the ground before a facebuster onto his knee and crotch chopping Rock. An early Rock Bottom was blocked with a strike, while Rock reversed the Pedigree by standing up and forcing Triple H over the top rope onto the mat. Rock's attempt to bring the ladder into the match saw him attacked from behind by Triple H and thrown from crowd barrier into crowd barrier. Inside the ring, Rock was allowed some time and used it to recover and take the fight to Triple H, throwing him through the ladder back outside the ring. As Rock secured the ladder inside the ring and began to climb it, Triple H slowly made his way back to ringside, climbing from the apron to the turnbuckle and jumping into Rock's back, forcing his head into the ladder and causing him to fall off however as the momentum shook Triple H to the side, the ladder fell on top of him. After Triple H drove the ladder into Rock's chest he began to climb it but four steps up, Rock pulled away at his leg, causing him to land on his previously injured knee. After continuing to work on Triple H's knee, Rock pushed the ladder onto his leg and then used it as a vice, trapping his knee in it and kicking the ladder on it, then using a chair similar to a hammer, reinforcing the ladder onto the knee. Rock then set up the ladder horizontally between the steps and the crowd barrier, picking his opponent up for a modified atomic drop, but with the knee taking the brunt of the drop onto the ladder. However, as The Rock took his time to take the ladder into the ring and set it up before climbing it, Triple H was able to desperately push his opponent off it and throw him out of the ring. The advantage did not remain though, as his own plans were used against him when Rock threw Triple H by his legs into the closed ladder, then falling face first onto the Spanish announce table. As Triple H crawled around, the fight moved to the walkway where both opponents threw each other into the barriers before Triple H tried to perform a Pedigree onto the ladder, but was tossed over his back onto it instead. Back inside the ring, Mark Henry threw a second ladder to Rock which he began to climb while Henry tried to subdue Triple H on the outside but was met with a forearm by Chyna. Triple H arrived just in time to push Rock off the ladder, crashing onto the mat and outside the ring. Triple H received similar treatment after recovering, then climbing the ladder only to have the ladder fall away from beneath him. After a DDT that left both men floored, both men eventually stood back up and then climbed either side of the same ladder, punching each other at the top with Triple H being thrown into the ladder in the turnbuckle and rebound to knock Rock off the ladder onto the ropes. Chyna had Triple H a chair which he hit Rock with, albeit with a ladder in the middle and continued a barrage of chair shots onto Rock through the ladder. This would not keep Rock down though, as he soon scooped Triple H onto the ladder and performed the People's Elbow with Triple H lying on the ladder. Despite receiving a Rock Bottom, Triple H managed to stagger to his feet just in time to pull Rock off the top rung of the ladder by his trunks and flooring him with a Pedigree. Struggling back to his feet anyway, Henry threw flour into Triple H's eyes but he slowly managed to climb by feel alone; although Rock was able to climb up to the top and meet him, Chyna used her forearm to low blow Rock, buying Triple H enough time to take the belt from where it was hanging.\nThe WWF Championship match began with each wrestler punching the other into the corner. After some grappling, a flurry of reversed arm twists refused to give either wrestler a noticeable advantage with Austin eventually dragging The Undertaker to the ground with an arm bar. Eventually Undertaker stood up and the two fought back and forth again, with Austin attempting a Lou Thesz press but being caught in a bear hug before having his neck thrown on the ropes. After this he began to attack Austin's back, first in the turnbuckle and then trying to trap him on the apron, but Stone Cold soon caught his opponent's leg and bashed it into the ring post. Austin returned to the knee, stomping it, after yanking Undertaker off the top rope from an Old School. It was at this point Kane made his presence known, walking solemnly to the ring but The Undertaker composed himself and sent him to the back. Again Austin attacked Undertaker's knee, using the leverage of the ring apron until an enraged Undertaker grabbed Austin by the neck, picking him up from the outside to the apron and then carrying him over the top rope and running, plunging him into the mat for a running chokeslam. The fight was then taken to the outside of the ring, going up the walk way and through the crowd with Austin being thrown over the crowd barrier and back into the ring. Austin, however, attempted a stunner and Undertaker responded by walking backwards, flipping over the top rope to the outside. When Stone Cold tried to attack him, he was caught in mid air and rammed into the ringpost. He was then smacked into the exposed Spanish announce table and left lying there was Undertaker went back into the ring and climbed the turnbuckle to deliver a flying guillotine leg drop that did connect, but did not break the table. When both competitors made it back to the ring, Austin kicked out of the pin count and when both resumed fighting the match was at a stalemate, with an exchange of attacks leading to a double clothesline, flooring both competitors. When the two made it up from that, though, Austin took a definite advantage, ramming his shoulder into Undertaker's chest before striking both a Lou Thesz press and an elbow drop. A botched stunner, turned neckbreaker, saw Undertaker kick out at two and in the ensuing fight, chokeslam the champion once more, signaling for his finisher. However, Stone Cold slipped off Undertaker's back when he tried this, but couldn't manage a stunner himself, the challenger picking him up by the leg and leaving him stranded on the ropes before pulling him to the ground with a Russian leg sweep, causing him to bleed from his mouth. When Undertaker tried an Old School again, it seemed successful until he jumped off the ropes and met with a low blow which caused him to stumble and fall into a Stone Cold Stunner, losing the match via pinfall. The Undertaker almost instantly sat up, having grabbed the championship belt from the referee and stood opposite Austin. Rather than strike him though, he gave the belt to the champion and nodded in respect, retiring to the walkway where he was met shoulder to shoulder with Kane, both looking on as Austin celebrated.\nReception.\nThe event has received positive reviews from critics.\nIn 2017, Kevin Pantoja of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.0 [Good], stating, \"I’d call this one of the better SummerSlam events in history. The only thing that I found truly bad was the overly long Oddities tag. The other two tag matches were both lackluster but not terrible. The rest of the show rules though. You have arguably the best Taker/Austin match, a surprisingly good opener, the cool Lion’s Den match, a good Hair vs. Hair match and of course, the standout Ladder match that helped make two of the biggest stars in company history.\"\nIn 2018, Chris of Retro Pro Wrestling gave the event a rating of Outstanding, stating, \"By far one of the better Summerslams in the event's history up to that point, there wasn't a single bad match on the card tonight. OK, so the Oddities/Kai En Tai comedy spot wasn't to everyone's liking, but it was harmless fun and this fan enjoyed it just fine. Elsewhere, we got good matches from D'Lo/Val, X-Pac/Jarrett and Austin/Taker, whilst Triple H and The Rock stole the show long before stealing the show became the prerogative of modern performers. Overall, an outstanding show that is definitely worth watching.\"\nIn 2022, John Canton of TJRWrestling gave the event a rating of 8/10, stating, \"Good matches all night long plus the breakout ladder match by Hunter and Rock make this one of the better SummerSlams ever. Fun to watch when it happened and still brings a smile to my face nearly 20 years later.\"\nAftermath.\nAustin and the Undertaker continued to feud following SummerSlam, and eventually it was revealed that both Undertaker and Kane were in cahoots with Vince McMahon to try to rid Austin of the title. This led to a match at in September between Austin and the brothers, where Undertaker and Kane were not allowed to pin each other. The match ended with both Undertaker and Kane pinning Austin simultaneously, which cost Austin the WWF Championship but left the title vacant. Austin was then forced to be the special guest referee for a match between Undertaker and Kane for the vacant title at in October, where he was threatened with being fired if he did not count the fall. Late in the match, after Undertaker hit Kane with a chair handed to him by his brother's manager Paul Bearer, Austin attacked Undertaker and counted both men pinned, declaring himself the champion. McMahon made good on his threat to fire Austin immediately thereafter, and the title remained vacant until Survivor Series. The night after Judgment Day Undertaker reunited with Paul Bearer and began recruiting for his Ministry of Darkness.\nAfter defeating Owen Hart, Ken Shamrock's longstanding feud that dated back to when Hart had joined the Nation of Domination came to an end. After briefly joining forces with The Rock and Mankind, Shamrock turned on Mankind and became a heel. The turn coincided with a legitimate injury suffered by Triple H, who was stripped of the Intercontinental Championship shortly after SummerSlam due to an injury. Shamrock won an eight-man tournament for the Intercontinental Championship in October and held it for the remainder of the year. Before the end of the year, Shamrock also joined The Corporation.\nD-Generation X continued to feud with Jeff Jarrett and Southern Justice for one additional pay-per-view, with the New Age Outlaws and X-Pac defeating Jarrett and his valets at Breakdown. X-Pac began feuding with D-Lo Brown after Breakdown and won the European Championship twice, while Road Dogg and Billy Gunn reigned as tag team champions until they were defeated by The Corporation's Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man in December 1998.\nAs for Jarrett and Hart, they eventually began teaming together following Summerslam. Although Hart largely began wrestling as \"The Blue Blazer\" shortly after the team was founded, the two enjoyed some success as a team and eventually became tag team champions in January 1999.\nAfter defeating The Rock in the ladder match to become Intercontinental Champion for the second time, Triple H had suffered a knee injury and he took time off to have surgery. On October 9, Vince McMahon stripped Triple H of the championship and set up a tournament for the vacated title which saw Ken Shamrock defeat X-Pac in the finals to become the new champion. Triple H would return in November 1998 and reunite with X-Pac saving him from a beating at the hands of Shamrock and Big Bossman. He would continue to feud with Rock who was part of The Corporation challenging him twice for the WWF Championship. At the end of the year he would challenge Shamrock for the Intercontinental title. He won the match by disqualification when Shamrock refused to release his Ankle lock submission hold. After the match, Billy Gunn saved Triple H which lead to a feud between him and Shamrock. The feud between DX and The Corporation continued until March 1999.\nAlthough he was still considered to be a heel going into Summerslam, The Rock became a face shortly thereafter due to an increasingly positive crowd reaction. It was during this time that he began aggressively promoting himself as \"The People's Champion\", which eventually led him into a feud with McMahon entering Survivor Series and the two eventually becoming allies.\nAfter over two years of portraying a tortured soul character, Mankind began a transition towards a more comedic character. After his brief feud with Shamrock, which included an Intercontinental Championship match at Judgment Day that Mankind lost, he began aligning himself with Vince McMahon in an attempt to become his friend. This led to Mankind becoming McMahon's protege, and led to Mankind apparently being given an easy road to win the vacant WWF title. The end of this angle coincided with the end of McMahon's feud with The Rock, and after \"Survivor Series\" Mankind and The Rock began a feud that led until the following February.\nAfter helping Sable defeat Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Edge entered a feud with Gangrel that eventually included Christian Cage, who was introduced as his storyline brother. After feuding for several weeks Edge was eventually convinced to join with Gangrel and Christian and the three formed a stable known as The Brood. Sable and Jacqueline then began feuding over the reactivated WWF Women's Championship, which Jacqueline won in September and Sable defeated her for in November at Survivor Series. Marc Mero quietly disappeared from the WWF shortly after going on a losing streak."

        "text": "The 1999 SummerSlam was the 12th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 22, 1999, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Nine matches were contested at the event.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 1999 event was the 12th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 22, 1999, at the Target Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam was between Stone Cold Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind over the WWF Championship. The previous month at Fully Loaded, Austin retained the WWF Championship by defeating The Undertaker in a first blood match when X-Pac interfered, allowing Austin to hit Undertaker with a television camera. Also at Fully Loaded, Triple H defeated The Rock in a Strap match to become the number one contender for the WWF Championship, thanks to the help of Billy Gunn and Chyna. In recent weeks, Triple H stated that he's been studying Austin for months to figure out how to beat him.\nOn the August 9 episode of \"Raw is War\", it was revealed that Minnesota governor as well as fellow WWF legend Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura would be the special guest referee for the main event at SummerSlam. When Triple H came out and got in Ventura's face, WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels set up a match between Austin, Triple H and Undertaker. When Austin was found mysteriously attacked in a stairwell, Michaels accused Triple H of being the attacker but Triple H denied it. Michaels then set up a Triple threat match with the title of number one contender on the line between Triple H, Undertaker and Chyna. Austin returned later that night and hit Triple H with a chair, then put Chyna on top allowing her to win the match and become number one contender.\nThe following week, Triple H challenged Chyna to a match with her number one contender status on the line which Chyna accepted. Chyna again won the match after Mankind returned from a knee injury and attacked Triple H. Mankind then challenged Chyna for her number one contender status but Chyna refused to accept and low blowed Mankind, Michaels overruled Chyna and made the match. Mankind later defeated Chyna when Triple H attempted to interfere. Shane McMahon stated as owner of the WWF he was booking a match between Mankind and Triple H to determine the undisputed number one contender. Michaels agreed to the match and he and Shane named themselves as referees. When Mankind and Triple H covered each other, Michaels and Shane both counted to three but they argued over who is the number one contender. Ring announcer Tony Chimel announced that both men are winners and that there will be a Triple threat match at SummerSlam.\nAnother rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between Test and Shane McMahon. In July before Fully Loaded, Shane and the Mean Street Posse had started a feud with Test because of his relationship with Stephanie McMahon whom Shane feels was dating \"beneath the family standards\". Over the following weeks, Test had faced Posse member Joey Abs whom Shane had set up on a date with Stephanie. On the July 12 episode of \"Raw is War\", Test wrestled the Posse in a Gauntlet match but it ended in no contest when Shane interfered. When the Posse attempted to break Test's ankle, Stephanie came out and grabbed her brother from behind. Thinking that it was a referee, Shane backhand elbowed his sister and knocked her out. The following two weeks, Stephanie rejected Joey Abs and demanded that her brother and his friends stay out of her life. On the August 15 episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", Shane challenged Test to a \"Love her or Leave her\" Greenwich Street Fight at SummerSlam. If Shane won Test and Stephanie could no longer see each other but if Test won Shane would give his blessing to them. Test agreed and accepted the challenge.\nThe third rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between the teams of X-Pac and Kane against The Undertaker and Big Show for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After X-Pac interfered in Undertaker's first blood match with Stone Cold Steve Austin at Fully Loaded, Undertaker blamed X-Pac for costing him the WWF Championship and attacked him the next night on \"Raw is War\". Kane came to his partner's rescue and brawled with his brother until Big Show (whom Kane lost to at Fully Loaded) ran out to the ring and joined Undertaker in putting a beating on both of them. Then Undertaker and Big Show shook hands and formed an alliance. Two weeks later, Kane and X-Pac defeated the Acolytes to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. Road Dogg came out to celebrate with them however all three were attacked by Big Show and Undertaker leading to a Tag Team Championship match between the two teams at SummerSlam.\nThe fourth rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between The Rock and Billy Gunn. At Fully Loaded, Rock lost to Triple H in a strap match after Gunn along with Chyna interfered and prevented Rock from pinning Triple H thus costing Rock the number one contender status for the WWF Championship. The next night on \"Raw is War\", Chyna dared The Rock to come out and repeat what he had said about her backstage to her face. When Rock came out, Gunn attacked Rock from behind with a club and he and Chyna double teamed him in the ring. Rock got up from the assault and challenged them both to a handicap match which he later won when he pinned Gunn after the people's elbow. The following week, it was announced that Rock and Gunn would face off in a match at SummerSlam.\nReception.\nIn 2014, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.5 [Good], stating, \"This is one of the more underrated editions of SummerSlam. [I] was pleasantly surprised by just how much I enjoyed the show. The wrestling was consistent with plenty of good performances across the board. That Shane McMahon/Test match is sensational and it should have helped launch Test as a major star and it showed that Shane McMahon is actually a capable in ring performer. They kept the overbooking, swerves, and nonsensical booking to a minimum and it resulted in exciting matches and a great atmosphere. Go out of your way to check this out, it really is an underrated gem of a show.\" The event was rated as the third best pay-per-view of 1999 by YouTube wrestling channel Cultaholic Wrestling in their ranking of every 1999 PPV ranked from worst to best.\nAftermath.\nAfter Triple H attacked Stone Cold after the match with steel chair shots to his legs and knee, Austin took time off to rehab from the injury but vowed to get revenge on Triple H. The next night on \"Raw is War\", Triple H bragged about crippling Austin and challenged Mankind to a match for the WWF Championship. With Shane McMahon as guest referee, Triple H defeated Mankind after a pedigree to win his first WWF Championship. \nMankind later formed an alliance with The Rock and they became known as The Rock 'n' Sock Connection. On the August 30 episode of \"Raw is War\", they defeated Undertaker and Big Show to win the WWF Tag Team Championship. On the September 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\", they lost the titles back to Undertaker and Big Show in a buried alive tag team match after Triple H interfered and hit Big Show with a slegehammer before he helped to bury Mankind. Austin returned and got revenge on Triple H by attacking him and throwing him into an ambulance before ramming it with a 18 wheeler truck. \nOn the September 13 episode of \"Raw is War\", Triple H had Austin arrested for aggravated assault and demanded that Linda McMahon put Austin at the bottom level of the ladder. Linda refused and Triple H began to accost her until Vince McMahon came to his wife's aid. Vince stated that he wouldn't get involved in WWF business but it was personal between him and Triple H. As he challenged him, Austin returned and attacked Triple H but lost a WWF title match to him when he punched referee Earl Hebner getting disqualified in the process. On the September 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Triple H had been ordered into a title defense of the WWF Championship. He picked Shane as the referee and picked Vince McMahon as his opponent. Vince won the match and the title when Austin attacked Triple H with a stunner. \nOn the September 20 episode of \"Raw is War\", Vince vacated the WWF Championship as he was prohibited from taking part in the company's day to day business due to the Fully Loaded contract he signed. Austin stated that he would reinstate him back in the WWF if he grants him his title shot. Vince accepted and stated that Austin would meet the winner of the six pack challenge match for the vacant WWF Championship at Unforgiven. He then announced that the vacant slot is given to Triple H and Austin would be the enforcer for the match.\nAt Unforgiven, Triple H regained the WWF Championship after winning the six pack challenge match when pinned Rock after a pedigree and Austin made the count.\nKen Shamrock would enter into a feud with the debuting Chris Jericho after Jericho launched numerous insults at him, then Jericho employed the returning Curtis Hughes as his bodyguard (similar to his gimmick in WCW when he had a bodyguard named \"Ralphus\").\nThe feud between Test and Shane McMahon continued as the next night on \"Raw is War\", Test came to the ring to propose to Stephanie McMahon but before she would accept they were interrupted by Shane who said that their relationship would continue \"Over my dead body!\" Stephanie scolded her brother asking him why he would take away something away from her that made her so happy. She then told Test that she loved him but said she just needed sometime to think and walked away smiling. \nOn the August 26 premiere episode of \"SmackDown!\", Test again proposed to Stephanie and she finally accepted. As they celebrated their engagement with a kiss, Shane and the Mean Street Posse hit the ring and attacked Test until he was saved by Mankind. Later Test and Stephanie announced their wedding date would be on the October 11 episode of \"Raw is War\". As they shared the news with the fans and with Pat Patterson, Gerald Brsico and Linda McMahon in the ring with them, The Posse who is now with Terri Runnels again interrupted and Shane came out and ended the feud by telling the Posse to leave and gave his blessing for Test and Stephanie's relationship asking Test to always treat Stephanie right. \nThe Posse responded on the September 13 episode of \"Raw is War\", by rebelling against Shane orders and Joey Abs challenged Test to a match after calling Stephanie a tramp. Test won the match but when the Posse attacked him again, Shane saved his future brother in law and he and Test chased the Posse out of the arena. On the September 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Shane challenged Abs to a match which he won after receiving help from Patterson, Brisco and Shawn Stasiak who was the referee."

        "text": "The 2000 SummerSlam was the 13th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 27, 2000, at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina. Ten matches were contested at the event.\nThe main event was a triple threat match for the WWF Championship involving champion The Rock, Triple H, and Kurt Angle. The Rock won the match and retained the title after pinning Triple H following a People's Elbow. One of the predominant matches on the undercard was Kane versus The Undertaker, which ended in a no contest after Undertaker ripped Kane's mask off which caused Kane to flee. Another featured match on the undercard was the first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the Tag Team Championship involving champions Edge and Christian, The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), and The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Edge and Christian won the match by retrieving the belts suspended above the ring.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2000 event was the 13th event in the SummerSlam chronology and was scheduled to be held on August 27, 2000, at the Raleigh Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Storylines between the characters played out on WWF's primary television programs, \"Raw Is War\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nOn the August 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Triple H and his wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, along with Kurt Angle, were booked in a six-man tag team match by Commissioner Mick Foley, against the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) and Lita which Triple H, McMahon, and Angle won. After the match, as Triple H left the ring, Angle and McMahon hugged in a victory celebration, frustrating Triple H and marking the beginning of a Triple H-Angle feud.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/3\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/3b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 7 edition of \"Raw is War\", Angle and Triple H were booked in a triple threat match, along with Chris Jericho, to determine the number one contender for a WWF Championship match against the defending champion, The Rock.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/7a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/7b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Both Angle and Triple H simultaneously pinned Jericho, which made both Angle and Triple H co-number one contenders; in frustration, Rock delivered a Rock Bottom on Triple H, Angle, and McMahon, who was at ringside during the match. Later that week on \"SmackDown!\", the match was made official for SummerSlam by Commissioner Foley.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/10a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/10b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He also booked a tag team match, where Angle and Triple H would team up against Rock and The Undertaker. During the match, Angle accidentally attacked Triple H, causing Triple H to walk out on the match and a loss for Angle. The following week on \"Raw is War\", Angle, Triple H, and Shane McMahon were booked in a six-man tag team match against the Dudley Boyz and Rock, with the stipulation that if Angle or Triple H walked away from the match, they would lose their number one contender status.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/14a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/14b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; During the match, Edge and Christian interfered by attacking the Dudley Boyz, which resulted in Angle, Triple H, and McMahon winning the match when Triple H pinned Rock; as a result of neither Triple H nor Angle walking out on the match, they both were able to keep their number one contender status.\nOn the August 14 edition of \"Raw is War\", Kane interfered in a match between The Undertaker and Chris Benoit and chokeslammed The Undertaker. After the interference, Kane rode out of the arena with The Undertaker's motorcycle, which was at ringside, signaling the start of a feud between The Undertaker and Kane, which was the second main feud heading into SummerSlam. On the August 17 edition of \"Smackdown\", the feud intensified during a segment in which Kane attacked The Undertaker with a steel chair, bloodying The Undertaker.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/21b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 20 edition of \"Sunday Night Heat\", it was made official that The Undertaker would face Kane at SummerSlam.&lt;ref name=\"SNH8/20\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) attacked the WWF Tag Team Champions, Edge and Christian, after their championship match against the Dudley Boyz. As the Hardy Boyz attacked Edge with a ladder, the Dudley Boyz powerbombed Christian through a table; this began a three-way feud, the third main rivalry heading into SummerSlam. The feud intensified on the August 14 edition of \"Raw is War\", when Edge and Christian attacked Matt Hardy with steel chairs after the Hardy Boyz' match against Right to Censor. Later that night, Commissioner Mick Foley announced a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between the three teams in a WrestleMania 2000 rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. On that week's edition of \"SmackDown!\", Jeff teamed up with D-Von to face Edge and Christian. During the match, Jeff accidentally delivered a Swanton Bomb to D-Von, which resulted in Edge pinning D-Von for the win.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/17a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/17b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Matt and Bubba came down to the ring, and the Hardys and the Dudleys brawled until they were pulled apart by WWF officials. Due to the events that occurred that past week, the Hardy Boyz were booked in a match against the Dudley Boyz the following week on \"Raw is War\", which the Hardys won.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/21a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the final episode of \"SmackDown!\" prior to SummerSlam, the Dudley Boyz interfered in a six-man tag team match between the team of the Hardy Boyz and Chris Jericho and the team of Edge, Christian, and Chris Benoit, which resulted in another brawl between the three teams. The interference allowed Jericho to pin Edge for the win.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/24a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/24b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nOn the July 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Chris Jericho and Lita defeated Chris Benoit and Trish Stratus in a mixed tag team match when Jericho pinned Benoit. Backstage after the match, Jericho in an interview mocked Benoit's claim of being the best \"technical wrestler in the world\" when Benoit viciously attacked Jericho from behind and threw him under a steel door before slamming it on his injured ribs. As Jericho coughed up blood, Benoit hit him with a steel chair. On the August 7 episode of \"Raw is War,\" Benoit challenged The Rock for the WWF Championship in a no disqualification match. As Benoit was putting the Crippler Crossface on Rock, Jericho interfered in the match and attacked Benoit before running off Shane McMahon who attempted to interfere in the match on Benoit's behalf. Rock retained the title after a Rock Bottom. When Benoit and Shane complained to Commissioner Foley about Jericho's interference, Foley put Jericho in the number one contender's match with Triple H and Kurt Angle which Jericho would lose when both men pinned him simultaneously. On the August 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Benoit and Intercontinental Champion Val Venis defeated Jericho and Eddie Guerrero when Benoit pinned Guerrero after a Diving Headbutt. After the match, Jericho attacked Benoit and put him in the Walls of Jericho. When Shane tried to make the save, Jericho put him in the same maneuver. Later that night, Jericho demanded a match against Benoit which Foley made for SummerSlam. The weeks leading up to the match would see Benoit and Jericho attacking each other and interfering in title matches by one costing the other. The match was later announced to be a Two-out-of-three falls match.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match that aired was a six-man tag team match between the team of Right to Censor (The Goodfather, Steven Richards, and Bull Buchanan) and Too Cool (Rikishi, Scotty 2 Hotty, and Grandmaster Sexay). Too Cool gained the early advantage, but The Goodfather retaliated by hitting a Big Boot on Sexay. Right to Censor continued with the advantage until midway into the match, when Richards attempted an aerial technique. Sexay, however, crotched Richards on the top turnbuckle and Superplexed him. Hotty was then tagged into the match, where he attempted to deliver a Worm to no avail, as Richards delivered a superkick on Hotty before pinning him to win the match.\nThe next match was the encounter of Road Dogg and X-Pac. Both men fought back and forth in the beginning of the match, but Dogg gained the advantage after countering an X-Factor into a powerbomb. Although Dogg had the advantage, X-Pac retaliated by successfully hitting a low blow and another X-Factor into a pinfall and winning the match. After the match, Road Dogg hit X-Pac with a pumphandle slam and performed some crotch chops.\nThe third match was an Intercontinental Championship Intergender Tag Team match between the team of Trish Stratus and defending champion Val Venis against the team of Chyna and Eddie Guerrero. In this match, the wrestler who gained the first pinfall would become the Intercontinental Champion. Guerrero and Chyna gained the early advantage in the match, but as Guerrero attempted a Hurricanrana, Venis countered it into a powerbomb. As the men tagged in the women, Chyna delivered a Military Press Slam on Stratus into a pinfall, winning the match for the team of herself and Guerrero. Due to pre-match stipulations, Chyna became the new Intercontinental Champion.\nThe next match was the encounter of Jerry Lawler and Tazz. The match began as Tazz gained the advantage, but Lawler retaliated by delivering a piledriver on Tazz. As Tazz recuperated, he applied the Tazzmission on Lawler; in desperation, Jim Ross, the commentating partner of Lawler, hit Tazz with a glass jar, breaking it over his head and allowing Lawler to pin Tazz for the win.\nThe fifth match was a Hardcore Championship match between Steve Blackman and the defending champion, Shane McMahon. Blackman had the advantage over McMahon midway into the match, until Test and Albert interfered on McMahon's behalf by double teaming Blackman. Nevertheless, Blackman retaliated as he hit both men with a kendo stick, which allowed McMahon to attempt an escape from the ring. Blackman then chased McMahon until both men were on a high steel structure, which was a part of the stage set. Blackman then hit McMahon with a kendo stick three times, causing him to fall from the steel structure onto the arena concrete floor. After the fall, Blackman performed an Elbow drop and got a pinfall to win the match and the Hardcore Championship.\nThe next match was a two out of three falls match between Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho. In the midst of the action, Jericho attempted a Lionsault, which Benoit countered into a Crippler Crossface, forcing Jericho to submit and winning the first fall. After the first fall, Benoit retained the advantage, but after he delivered two Belly to Belly suplexes, Jericho countered a third one into the Walls of Jericho, forcing Benoit to submit and allowing Jericho to win his first fall (the second fall in the match). As Benoit and Jericho fought back and forth, Benoit countered a Cradle by Jericho into one of his own, and he pinned Jericho by holding on to the ring ropes for leverage to win his second fall (the third fall overall) and the match.\nMain event matches.\nThe seventh match was the first triple threat tag team Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match for the Tag Team Championship between the team of the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy), Edge and Christian, and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). The Dudley Boyz gained an advantage in the match when they delivered a 3-D on Christian through a table. Jeff Hardy then attempted a Swanton Bomb on Bubba through a table, but it backfired when Bubba moved and Jeff went through the table. Subsequently, Edge and Christian knocked Bubba off of a ladder outside of the ring, through four double-stacked tables. Lita, the associate of the Hardy Boyz, then came down to the ring, pushing Edge and Christian off a ladder. This allowed Matt to climb a ladder to retrieve the championship belts, but D-Von pushed the ladder, resulting in Matt falling at ringside through two double-stacked tables. Lita came to check on Matt, but she was brutally speared by Edge in retaliation and was taken out of the match. D-Von then climbed another ladder, along with Jeff, but Edge and Christian knocked the ladder over, leaving Jeff and D-Von hanging on the belt; Jeff then kicked D-Von a few times, causing the latter to fall into the ring. Jeff was eventually hit with a ladder by Christian and fell into the ring, allowing Edge and Christian to climb another ladder and retrieve the championship belts to retain the Tag Team Championship.\nThe next match was a Stinkface match between The Kat and Terri. After back and forth action between the two women, The Kat gained the advantage after she performed a powerslam on Terri and then threw Terri into the turnbuckle and delivered a Stinkface on her for the win.\nThe final match on the undercard was the encounter of Kane and The Undertaker. Before the match began, Kane attacked The Undertaker on the ring aisle. Kane then attempted to attack The Undertaker with the steel ring steps, but The Undertaker retaliated by avoiding the attack. Kane then performed a low blow on The Undertaker, who retaliated by delivering a Spear and ripping Kane's mask off, which resulted in Kane exiting the ring to the backstage area, ending the match with no winner.\nThe final match of the night was a WWF Championship Triple-Threat match between Triple H, Kurt Angle, and the defending champion, The Rock. Before The Rock made his entrance, Angle and Triple H fought at ringside, with Triple H delivering a Pedigree on Angle on the commentator's announce table, which broke prematurely, resulting in Angle being injured with a concussion though he was to have been (kayfabe) out of the match during this time anyway. After the incident, The Rock made his entrance down to the ring. He wrestled Triple H as Angle was attended by EMTs, who transported Angle backstage. Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley then came down to the ring and attempted to interfere by hitting The Rock with the WWF Championship belt. She accidentally hit Triple H, however, which resulted in Triple H ordering McMahon to the backstage area. Angle returned to the ring midway through the match, alongside McMahon, and attacked Triple H. As Triple H recuperated, Angle called McMahon to give him a sledgehammer, but Angle and Triple H brawled over the sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H accidentally hitting McMahon. This situation allowed The Rock to throw Angle over the top rope onto ringside and deliver a People's Elbow on Triple H into a pinfall to win the match and retain the WWF Championship.\nReception.\nIn 2006, J.D. Dunn of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.5 [Very Good], writing, \"This was the height of the WWF as former \"Daily Show\" writer Chris Kreski booked one of the more compelling soap opera angles in WWE history. Unlike what Russo did, Kreski's stuff was always streamlined so it never spun out of control or lost focus like so many Russo angles. Plus, with Jericho and the Radicalz in the WWF, there was now enough actual talent to put some wrestling on their wrestling show. Imagine that. Most of the matches are throwaways, but the right people were put in the right places to do the right matches, and that's where the entertainment comes from.\nSolid thumbs up.\"\nAftermath.\nThe Kurt Angle–Triple H feud would continue after SummerSlam. On the first episode of \"Raw is War\" after SummerSlam, Angle interfered in a match between Triple H and Eddie Guerrero by attacking both men with a steel chair.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/28a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/28b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The feud intensified once more, as Triple H and Angle brawled on the September 11 episode of \"Raw is War\" after a match between Triple H and Chris Jericho.&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/11a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/11b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, Commissioner Mick Foley booked a match between Angle and Triple H at Unforgiven. The following week on \"Raw is War\", Foley announced that he would be the Special Guest Referee for the match between Triple H and Angle.&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/18a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/18b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the final episode of \"SmackDown!\" before Unforgiven, the feud escalated when Angle attacked Triple H with a sledgehammer, resulting in Triple H becoming unconscious and allowing Angle to kiss Triple H's wife, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, who was at ringside.&lt;ref name=\"SD9/21\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD9/21b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Unforgiven, Triple H pinned Angle after a Pedigree.\nAfter SummerSlam, a feud began between Kane, The Undertaker, The Rock, and Chris Benoit over the WWF Championship. Kane and The Undertaker continued to feud on the August 28 episode of \"Raw is War\", where The Undertaker interfered in a WWF Championship match between Kane and The Rock (the winner of the match). The feud between Kane and Benoit began on the September 4 episode of \"Raw is War\" during a WWF Championship number one contender's match, as Benoit attacked Kane with a steel chair.&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/4\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW9/4b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The feud between Kane and The Rock began later that week on \"SmackDown!\", when Kane chokeslammed The Rock through the commentator's announce table.&lt;ref name=\"SD9/7\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD9/7b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The following week on \"Raw is War\", the feud between Kane, Benoit, The Undertaker, and The Rock officially began, as Kane, Benoit, and The Undertaker cut promos about how they deserved to face The Rock at Unforgiven for the WWF Championship. The situation resulted in a brawl between all four wrestlers. Later that night, Commissioner Foley announced that a Fatal-Four Way match would take place at Unforgiven for the WWF Championship. At Unforgiven, The Rock retained the WWF Championship after he performed a Rock Bottom on Benoit into a pinfall.\nThe feud between the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian over the WWF Tag Team Championship continued after SummerSlam. On the \"Raw is War\" edition after SummerSlam, the Hardy Boyz and Edge and Christian brawled throughout the night on different occasions. On the September 11 edition of \"Raw is War\", The Hardy Boyz defeated the Dudley Boyz in a tag team match to become the number one contenders for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The following week on \"SmackDown!\", Commissioner Foley announced a Steel Cage match for the WWF Tag Team Championship at Unforgiven, between the teams of Edge and Christian and the Hardy Boyz.&lt;ref name=\"SD9/14a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD9/14b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Unforgiven, The Hardy Boyz escaped the Steel Cage to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the Dudley Boyz were unable to win the number one contender's match, they were involved in a short-lived feud with the A.P.A, as the Dudley Boyz defeated the A.P.A on the September 4 edition of \"Raw is War\". The defeat led to the A.P.A challenging the Dudley Boyz into a Bar Room Brawl, which ended in a no contest. After the match, The Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A united as they drank beer and attacked Kai En Tai. The Dudley Boyz then began a feud with the Right to Censor on the September 18 edition of \"Raw is War\", where after losing a match to the Dudley Boyz, all four members of Right to Censor attacked them. The attack led to the A.P.A coming down to the ring to help the Dudley Boyz. On the September 21 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Commissioner Foley announced an eight-man tag team match between the team of Right to Censor against the team of the Dudley Boyz and the A.P.A at Unforgiven.

        "text": "The 2001 SummerSlam was the 14th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, not WWE). It took place on August 19, 2001, at the Compaq Center at San Jose in San Jose, California. It was the last SummerSlam promoted under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. It was also the last SummerSlam held before the introduction of the brand extension in March 2002.\nIn the main event, The Rock defeated Booker T for the WCW Championship, after executing a Rock Bottom. The other two main matches on the card were Steve Austin versus Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship, which Angle won, after Austin was disqualified for attacking referees, and Rob Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy in a ladder match for the WWF Hardcore Championship. The other main match on the undercard was the Winners Take All Steel cage match between WCW Tag Team Champions Undertaker and Kane and WWF Tag Team Champions Diamond Dallas Page and Kanyon, which Undertaker and Kane won, after Undertaker executed the Last Ride and pinned Page to win both titles.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, and Survivor Series, and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It has since become considered WWF's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2001 event was the 14th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 19, 2001, at the Compaq Center at San Jose in San Jose, California.\nStorylines.\nThe main rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between The Rock and Booker T, battling over the WCW Championship. After losing the WWF Championship to Steve Austin at WrestleMania X-Seven, The Rock took a hiatus from professional wrestling to film the movie \"The Scorpion King\". On the July 9, 2001 edition of \"Raw Is War\", campaigning for The Rock's return began.&lt;ref name=\"RAW7/9a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW7/30b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Following the campaigning, The Rock returned to the WWF on the July 30, 2001 edition of \"Raw Is War\", where he chose to align himself with the WWF instead of The Alliance for The Invasion.&lt;ref name=\"RAW7/30a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This action was shown by The Rock delivering a Rock Bottom and the People's Elbow onto Shane McMahon, The Alliance leader. Later that week on \"SmackDown!\", Booker T and The Rock cut a promo, where Booker T challenged The Rock to a match at SummerSlam; the beginning of the Rock-Booker T rivalry.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/2a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/2b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Seeking revenge for the attack from the previous week, McMahon fought The Rock in a Street Fight on the August 6 edition of \"Raw Is War\", where The Rock pinned McMahon. The rivalry between The Rock and Booker T intensified after the match, where Booker T and Shane McMahon double-teamed The Rock.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/6a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/6b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week on \"SmackDown!\", in retaliation, The Rock accepted Booker T's challenge.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/9a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/9b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the August 13 edition of \"Raw Is War\", The Rock was involved in a tag team match, where he teamed with Chris Jericho in a loss to Booker T and Rhyno.&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/13a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"RAW8/13b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After the match, Booker T delivered his variation of the Rock Bottom on The Rock, a move dubbed, \"The Book End\". On the final edition of \"SmackDown!\" before SummerSlam, McMahon announced that Booker T would defend the WCW Championship at SummerSlam against The Rock.&lt;ref name=\"SD8/16a\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=\"SD8/16b\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, the rivalry continued to intensify during a Lights Out match between Booker T and The Rock, after Booker T delivered a Book End onto The Rock through a commentators announce table.\nThe other main match on the card was Stone Cold Steve Austin versus Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. The previous month at Invasion, Team WCW/ECW (Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, Rhyno and Bubba Ray and D-Von Dudley) defeated Team WWF (Austin, Angle, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker and Kane). Team WCW/ECW won after Austin turned on the WWF when he executed a Stunner on Angle. On the following night's edition of \"Raw Is War\", Austin stated that he did this because he felt that Vince McMahon was grooming Angle to take over his spot, and that he was \"unappreciated\" when McMahon insisted he return to the old Austin. Later that evening, Austin interfered during a six man Elimination Tables match by assaulting Angle. Then on the July 26, 2001 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Angle appeared in his hometown of Pittsburgh and challenged Austin for the WWF Championship but Austin instead chose Booker T to defend his WCW Championship against Angle. Later on that night, Angle won the WCW Championship from Booker despite Austin's interference. On the July 30, 2001 edition of \"Raw Is War\", Angle lost the WCW Championship back to Booker with the help of Austin and Shane McMahon. Afterwards, Angle challenged Austin for the WWF Championship at SummerSlam, which Austin accepted. The feud between Austin and Angle would escalate in the following couple of weeks leading up to SummerSlam especially in a Six Man Tag Team Elimination match pitting Austin and the Dudley Boyz against Angle and The Hardy Boyz, which Austin and the Dudley Boyz won.\nAnother main match heading into the event was Jeff Hardy versus Rob Van Dam in a Ladder match for the WWF Hardcore Championship. At Invasion Van Dam defeated Hardy to win the Hardcore Championship. In the following weeks, Van Dam and Hardy faced each other in Tag Team matches. On the August 13 edition of \"Raw\", Van Dam was scheduled to defend his title against Kurt Angle, and as the match was underway, Hardy interfered and pinned Van Dam to win the title for himself. This led to a Ladder match for the title at SummerSlam between Hardy and Van Dam.\nEvent.\nBefore the event began, a dark match took place on Heat. The match was originally a handicap match featuring Lita and Jacqueline against Torrie Wilson, Stacy Keibler, and Ivory. Backstage, Wilson, Ivory and Keibler attacked Lita, preventing her from competing. Molly Holly replaced Lita.

Rock performed a Catapult into an exposed turnbuckle on Booker and performed a DDT on Booker for a near-fall. Booker distracted the referee by trying to retrieve a steel chair placed in the ring by McMahon, allowing Shane to hit Rock with the title belt. The APA appeared, with Bradshaw performing a Clothesline from Hell on Shane in retaliation for Shane costing the APA their six-man tag team match. Booker performed a \"Book End\" on Rock for a near-fall. Rock performed a Spinebuster and a People's Elbow on Booker but Shane pulled the referee out of the ring, voiding the pinfall. Rock performed a Rock Bottom on Shane outside the ring. Booker performed a \"Scissors Kick\" on Rock and performed the Spinarooni. However; Rock quickly got up with a kip-up, no-selling the attack, and performed a \"Rock Bottom\" on Booker to win the Championship, his seventh World Championship overall and first WCW Championship reign.\nReception.\nIn 2013, Dylan Diot of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.5 [Very Good], writing, \"This was a damn good edition of Summerslam. Nothing on the show was bad and two of the matches were absolutely outstanding. [This] show is well worth a watch, especially for Angle's memorable performance and another classic ladder match. The Invasion angle may have [sucked], but at least the effort in the ring was great.\"\nAftermath.\nThis was the last SummerSlam to occur before the introduction of the first brand extension in March 2002, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. It was also the last SummerSlam event to occur under the WWF name, as the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in May 2002. Additionally, King of the Ring was discontinued as a PPV following its 2002 event, thus SummerSlam, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, reverted to being called the \"Big Four\" until October 2021 when Money in the Bank was recognized as one of the \"Big Five\".\nWith the WWF's purchase of rival company World Championship Wrestling (WCW) back in March, some of their titles became defended on WWF programming. As such, the 2001 event was the only SummerSlam to feature the WCW Championship, as the title was unified with the WWF Championship at December's Vengeance event with the latter being renamed to Undisputed WWF Championship. It was also the only SummerSlam to feature the WCW Tag Team Championship, which was unified with the WWF Tag Team Championship at Survivor Series in November. It was also the first SummerSlam to feature the WCW Cruiserweight Championship and the last to feature the WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, which was dropped in March 2002 in favor of continuing the Cruiserweight Championship, which was rebranded as a WWF title."

        "text": "The 2002 SummerSlam was the 15th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 25, 2002, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. With this event, SummerSlam became the first pay-per-view to have events in the three major indoor venues in the New York metropolitan area. Madison Square Garden hosted the event in 1988, 1991, and 1998, and the Izod Center in East Rutherford, New Jersey hosted the event in 1989, 1997, and later in 2007. This was also the first SummerSlam held under the WWE name, after the promotion was renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May, and the first SummerSlam held following the introduction of the brand extension in March.\nThe main match on the SmackDown! brand was for the WWE Undisputed Championship between The Rock and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar won the match and the championship after pinning Rock following an F-5. The main match on the Raw brand featured an Unsanctioned Street Fight between the returning Shawn Michaels and Triple H, which Michaels won after pinning Triple H by reversing Triple H's Pedigree attempt into a jackknife roll-up. There was also an interpromotional match for the Intercontinental Championship between Rob Van Dam from Raw and Chris Benoit from SmackDown!, which Van Dam won by pinfall after performing a Five-Star Frog Splash. The other matches on the undercard included The Undertaker versus Test and Kurt Angle versus Rey Mysterio. SummerSlam 2002 is widely regarded among fans and critics as the greatest SummerSlam of all time as well as one of the greatest professional wrestling pay-per-views of all time, often receiving comparisons to WrestleMania X-Seven from the previous year in 2001.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring until its discontinuation after its 2002 event. It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2002 event was the 15th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 25, 2002, at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, New York. It was the first SummerSlam to occur under the first brand extension introduced in March, which split the roster between the Raw and SmackDown! brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform; SummerSlam featured wrestlers from both brands. It was also the first SummerSlam to occur under the WWE name, following the promotion being renamed from World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to WWE in May.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\" with the Raw and SmackDown! brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nSmackDown!\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam on the SmackDown! brand was between The Rock and Brock Lesnar, with the two feuding over the WWE Undisputed Championship. On the June 24 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Lesnar would face off against the WWE Undisputed Champion at SummerSlam, as a result of winning the King of the Ring tournament.&lt;ref name=\"411mania.com - 6/24 RAW results\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At Vengeance, The Rock defeated The Undertaker and Kurt Angle in a triple threat match to win the WWE Undisputed Championship by pinning Angle after executing a Rock Bottom. On the July 25 episode of \"SmackDown!\", during The Rock's WWE Tag Team Championship match against The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian), Lesnar interfered by nailing The Rock's tag team partner Hollywood Hulk Hogan with an F-5. Due to Lesnar's interference, The Rock and Hogan won the match by disqualification, but not the titles. On the August 8 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Lesnar put his SummerSlam title shot on the line against Hogan with the stipulation added that if Hogan were to defeat Lesnar, he would face The Rock in a WrestleMania X8 rematch at SummerSlam for the WWE Undisputed Championship. At the end, Lesnar locked Hogan in a bear hug. When Hogan (kayfabe) passed out, the referee stopped the contest. After the match, Lesnar then nailed Hogan in the head with the steel chair, causing Hogan to bleed. On the August 15 episode of \"SmackDown!\", The Rock took on the WWE Intercontinental Champion Chris Benoit in a \"Champion vs. Champion\" match, which Lesnar interfered once again. During the match, Lesnar taunted The Rock while The Rock was placed in the Crippler Crossface by Benoit. The Rock, however, was able to defeat Benoit following a Rock Bottom. On the August 22 episode of \"SmackDown!\", after The Rock and Edge defeated Benoit and Eddie Guerrero in a tag team match, Lesnar appeared for another stare down with The Rock, which led to a brawl between the two that ended the show.\nOn the July 25 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Rey Mysterio made his WWE debut by defeating Chavo Guerrero. On the August 8 episode of \"SmackDown!\", the team of Mysterio, Edge and John Cena defeated Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero and Kurt Angle when Mysterio pinned Angle. On the August 15 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Angle insulted Mysterio during a backstage interview and Mysterio confronted him and challenged him to a match at SummerSlam, which Angle accepted. Later that night, Mysterio attacked Angle after his match against Mark Henry and delivered a 619 to Angle. On the August 22 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Mysterio cost Angle a match against Billy Kidman by attacking Angle.\nRaw.\nAnother feud heading into SummerSlam was between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. At Vengeance, Michaels returned after being out of wrestling (due to a back injury) for four years. Triple H was given the choice of deciding which brand he would appear for, Raw or SmackDown!, and Michaels helped him decide by offering to reform D-Generation X (D-X) on the Raw brand. Triple H chose to go to the Raw brand, but on the July 22 episode of \"Raw\", as Michaels and Triple H were in the middle of reforming D-X, Triple H turned on Michaels by nailing him with the Pedigree. On the July 29 episode of \"Raw\", Michaels was found in the parking lot, laying motionless following an ambush. He was also bleeding from the head due to someone putting his head through a car window. On the August 5 episode of \"Raw\", a security camera revealed to be Triple H that had attacked Michaels from behind. Triple H told Michaels that he did it to prove a point that Michaels was \"weak\". Michaels then told Triple H that he wasn't 100%, but he would be at SummerSlam. On the August 19 episode of \"Raw\", Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff announced an Unsanctioned Street Fight between Triple H and Michaels for SummerSlam. Later that night, Michaels interfered in Triple H's non-title match with The Rock and assaulted Triple H. At the beginning of the show, Brock Lesnar bought a front-row seat ticket to watch the main event between The Rock and Triple H, but even when Lesnar tried to interfere on Triple H's behalf, Michaels delivered a Sweet Chin Music to Lesnar. Michaels then leaped on top of Triple H and the security and ended the show by knocking Triple H down, sending a clear message that he was not weak as they headed into their match at SummerSlam.\nRob Van Dam and Chris Benoit, meanwhile, had been feuding over the WWE Intercontinental Championship since Benoit won it from Van Dam on the July 29 episode of \"Raw\". Shortly after this match, Benoit took advantage of what was referred to as \"open season\" on wrestler contracts and took his title with him to the SmackDown! brand, where he had originally been drafted. Benoit was still required to defend the title against a member of the Raw roster at SummerSlam and Van Dam defeated Jeff Hardy on the August 12 episode of \"Raw\" in a match to determine the #1 contender.\nEvent.\nThe event unofficially began with a \"Sunday Night Heat\" match between Spike Dudley and Steven Richards. Dudley pinned Richards.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match was between Kurt Angle and Rey Mysterio. The match started off with Mysterio getting the advantage over Angle, as he hid under the ring, and when Mysterio's music hit, he took down Angle with a headscissors. The two entered the ring, which saw Mysterio execute a headscissors takeover. Mysterio attempted the 619 but Angle ducked and dominated Mysterio. However, Mysterio was able to execute a senton from the ring to the floor on Angle. Mysterio then delivered the 619 and the West Coast Pop for a nearfall. Angle reversed a diving hurricarana into the ankle lock, to which Mysterio submitted.\nThe next match was a contest between Ric Flair and Chris Jericho. Jericho put Flair into the figure-four leglock. Jericho insisted that Flair submitted, but the referee ordered the match to continue. Flair then won the match by applying the hold on Jericho.\nThe third match of the night was between Edge and Eddie Guerrero. During the match, Guerrero targeted Edge's shoulder. Guerrero also countered a spear attempt with a dropkick to the shoulder, and executed a frog splash onto Edge's shoulder. Edge retaliated with an Edgecution and a spear for the win.\nThe next match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship between The Un-Americans (Lance Storm and Christian) and Booker T and Goldust. During the match, Booker T executed a scissors kick to both Storm and Christian, but Test made a run-in and gave Booker T a big boot. Christian pinned Booker T to retain the titles for The Un-Americans.\nThe fifth match on the card was for the Intercontinental Championship between Chris Benoit and Rob Van Dam. Van Dam won the title by pinning Benoit after a Five Star Frog Splash.\nThe Undertaker against Test was next. Lance Storm and Christian both interfered in the match, but received a chokeslam from The Undertaker. The Undertaker won the match with a Tombstone Piledriver. After the match, The Undertaker waved an American flag.\nThe seventh match was the Unsanctioned Street Fight between Shawn Michaels and Triple H. This was Shawn Michaels' first wrestling match since WrestleMania XIV. Michaels came out fast, using a punch-kick offense to start and executing a plancha. Triple H executed a series of backbreakers on Michaels. Michaels hit Triple H with a ladder. Michaels executed a splash on Triple H from the top rope through a table on the floor and a diving elbow drop off a ladder. The match came to an end when Michaels went for the Sweet Chin Music, which Triple H countered into a Pedigree attempt, but Michaels countered into a jackknife roll-up for the win. After the match, Triple H hit Michaels with a sledgehammer twice, forcing Michaels to be carried away on a stretcher.\nMain event match.\nThe main event was for the WWE Undisputed Championship between The Rock and Brock Lesnar. Lesnar dominated early with some power moves. The Rock went for the Sharpshooter. Lesnar's manager Paul Heyman got involved in the match, as he was attacked by The Rock, who executed a Rock Bottom through a broadcast table on Heyman. The Rock and Brock Lesnar gave each other a Rock Bottom. The match came to an end when Lesnar stopped a People's Elbow and a \"Rock Bottom\" and then executed the F-5 on The Rock for the win and the title. Lesnar remained the youngest world champion in WWE history until Randy Orton won the World Heavyweight Championship in 2004.\nAftermath.\nOn the August 26 episode of \"Raw\", due to the requirements of the WWE Undisputed Championship being defended on both shows, Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff expected Brock Lesnar to be able to return on \"Raw\" the next night. Lesnar and SmackDown! General Manager Stephanie McMahon appeared to announce that Lesnar's contract only required him to defend the title on \"SmackDown!\"; subsequently Bischoff established the World Heavyweight Championship as a separate world title. On the September 2 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff awarded Triple H, \"Raw\"'s designated number-one contender, the World Heavyweight Championship in the form of the Big Gold Belt.\nThe Undertaker went on to challenge Lesnar for the now-renamed WWE Championship at Unforgiven, and again at No Mercy in a Hell in a Cell match. Shawn Michaels would return full-time to the ring at Survivor Series and win the World Heavyweight Championship from Triple H in the first ever Elimination Chamber match.\nAfter the broadcasting of the event had stopped after the main event, former WWE Undisputed Champion The Rock was visibly angry at the crowd reaction. The Rock had faced a negative response from fans during the main event. When he tried to do a post-show speech for the crowd, the fans attending the Nassau Coliseum still booed him. He eventually cut a promo, declaring that \"sing-along with The Rock is over!\", before taking a six-month hiatus from WWE. The Rock did not return until late January 2003, where he turned heel on Hulk Hogan, leading to a WrestleMania X8 rematch at No Way Out where special guest referee Sylvain Grenier and Mr. McMahon both interfered and helped The Rock defeat Hogan."

        "text": "The 2003 SummerSlam was the 16th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place August 24, 2003, at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona.\nSeven professional wrestling matches were set on the event's supercard, a scheduling of multiple high-level matches. The first main event was an Elimination Chamber match, in which World Heavyweight Champion Triple H defeated Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels to retain his championship. In the other main event, defending WWE Champion Kurt Angle defeated Brock Lesnar in a standard wrestling match. The undercard included Kane defeating Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match, and Eddie Guerrero defending his United States Championship against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. There was also a match that occurred on the \"Sunday Night Heat\" pre-show.\nThe event marked the second time the Elimination Chamber format was used by WWE; the first was at Survivor Series 2002. SummerSlam (2003) grossed over $715,000 ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113 and received about 415,000 pay-per-view buys, more than the following year's event. This event helped WWE increase its pay-per-view revenue by $6.2 million from the previous year. \nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2003 event was the 16th SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 24, 2003, at the America West Arena in Phoenix, Arizona. It was the first SummerSlam to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, following its establishment for Raw in September 2002 after the WWE Undisputed Championship became exclusive to SmackDown! and renamed to the WWE Championship.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\" with the Raw and SmackDown! brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its independent contractors to different programs.\nIn the first main event of SummerSlam, wrestlers from the Raw brand competed in an Elimination Chamber match. The match was contested for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The buildup to the match began on July 22, when during the SummerSlam press conference, the Raw co-general manager Eric Bischoff, announced that Triple H would defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg in a singles match at SummerSlam. On the August 4 episode of \"Raw\", Bischoff changed the stipulations of the match to No disqualification regulations. Later during the episode, co-general manager Stone Cold Steve Austin altered Bischoff's announcement, stating that the World Heavyweight Championship would be contested in an Elimination Chamber match, with Triple H defending his title against Goldberg, Jericho, Nash, Orton, and Michaels. On the August 18 episode of \"Raw\", the rivalry among the six competitors intensified during a promo, in which each participant in the Elimination Chamber discussed the match and taunted the other wrestlers. During the show's main event, in which Orton wrestled Goldberg, Nash interfered in the match and attacked Goldberg. Michaels then came down to the ring, but as he was about to hit Triple H with the World Heavyweight Championship belt, Jericho ran into the ring and hit Michaels with a chair.\nThe second main event resulted from events on the SmackDown! brand. In the match, Kurt Angle defended his WWE Championship against Brock Lesnar. The build-up to the match began on the July 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\". During an interview promotion in the ring, Lesnar challenged Angle to a rematch after Angle won the WWE Championship from him at Vengeance in a triple threat match (also involving Big Show). Vince McMahon decided that Lesnar would have to earn his rematch by competing in a steel cage match against McMahon himself with Angle officiating as a special guest referee. On the August 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", the steel cage match resulted in neither wrestler winning the match, after Lesnar attacked Angle and formed an alliance with McMahon. On the August 14 episode of \"SmackDown!\", McMahon announced that Angle would defend the WWE Championship against Lesnar at SummerSlam.\nIn a preliminary match involving wrestlers from the Raw brand, Rob Van Dam wrestled Kane under No disqualification regulations. The events leading up to this match began on the June 23 episode of \"Raw\", when Kane took his mask off and exposed his face in front of Van Dam and the crowd after he lost to Triple H in a match for the World Heavyweight Championship (which was the stipulation) before chokeslamming Van Dam. On the July 7 episode of \"Raw\", Kane attacked Van Dam backstage. On the July 14 episode of \"Raw\", Eric Bischoff granted Van Dam a standard match against Kane, which took place on the July 21 episode of \"Raw\" and ended in neither wrestler winning the match. On the August 4 episode of \"Raw\", Shane McMahon scheduled a No Disqualification match between Kane and Van Dam for SummerSlam.\nIn another preliminary match, wrestlers from the SmackDown! brand competed in a fatal four-way match for the WWE United States Championship: Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The buildup to the match began with two different rivalries, one between Guerrero and Tajiri, and the other between Benoit and Rhyno. On the August 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Guerrero and Benoit wrestled in a standard match. However, during the match, Rhyno and Tajiri interfered, resulting in neither wrestler winning the match. Sgt. Slaughter, a WWE official, scheduled a tag team match between Guerrero and Rhyno and Benoit and Tajiri, which Benoit and Tajiri won. On the August 14 episode of \"SmackDown!\", it was announced that Guerrero would defend the WWE United States Championship against Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri at SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nSunday Night Heat.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view, Matt Hardy faced Zach Gowen on \"Sunday Night Heat\". Gowen, however, was unable to compete due to legitimate injuries he sustained at the hands of Brock Lesnar on the August 21, 2003 edition of \"SmackDown!\". As a result, Hardy was declared the winner via forfeit. \nIn the next match, Rey Mysterio faced Shannon Moore for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, in which Mysterio pinned Moore to retain the title after he performed 619.\nPreliminary matches.\nAfter \"Sunday Night Heat,\" the pay-per-view event began with a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.\nThe following match pitted The Undertaker against A-Train in a standard match. In the early stages both competitors wrestled inconclusively before The Undertaker gained the advantage. He attempted to lift A-Train for a Tombstone piledriver. A-Train countered it, in the process knocking the referee down. He attempted to take advantage of the situation by trying to hit The Undertaker with a steel chair. The Undertaker, however, countered the attack with his boot, causing the chair to hit A-Train in the face. The Undertaker then chokeslammed A-Train and, since the referee had recuperated, covered his opponent for the pinfall. After the match, Sable tried to seduce Undertaker, but was grabbed by the throat and then was attacked by a returning Stephanie McMahon.\nThe third match Shane McMahon against Eric Bischoff. McMahon and Bischoff began by brawling on the arena ramp, as Jonathan Coachman appeared from the backstage area and hit McMahon with a steel chair. Bischoff grabbed a microphone and announced that the match would be contested under no disqualification, falls count anywhere regulations. Coachman and Bischoff performed double-team attacks on McMahon until Stone Cold Steve Austin interfered by performing a Stone Cold Stunner on Coachman and Bischoff. After Austin's interference, McMahon positioned Bischoff on the television commentators' table, performed a Leap of Faith onto Bischoff's chest, thereby breaking the table and covered Bischoff for the pinfall.\nThe next match was a Fatal 4-Way match for the WWE United States Championship; Eddie Guerrero defended the title against Chris Benoit, Rhyno, and Tajiri. The match began with Guerrero wrestling with Tajiri, while Benoit wrestled with Rhyno. During the encounter Guerrero applied a Lasso From El Passo on Tajiri, while Benoit employed a Crippler Crossface on Rhyno. Afterwards, Tajiri applied a Tarantula on Benoit. The hold distracted the referee, which allowed Guerrero to hit Rhyno with the United States Championship belt. Tajiri then attempted to hit Benoit with a Buzzsaw Kick, but Benoit countered the maneuver by lifting and sitting Tajiri onto his shoulders. Tajiri, however, countered by tossing both himself and Benoit over the top rope onto the arena floor. Capitalizing on the situation, Guerrero then performed a Frog splash on Rhyno, after which he scored the pinfall, thus retaining the WWE United States Championship.\nMain event matches.\nThe fifth match was a match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At the beginning of the match, Lesnar tried to walk away from the ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including a DDT and the Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon interfered, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship. After the match, Angle slammed McMahon through a chair.\nIn the sixth match, Kane faced Rob Van Dam in a No Holds Barred match. Both wrestlers used the steel folding ladder to their advantage early in the match. After Kane used the ladder on Van Dam, he attempted to hit Van Dam with a flying clothesline. However, Van Dam moved out of the way and Kane landed on the arena barricade. Van Dam performed a variation of a rolling thunder on Kane using a steel folding chair. Following this, Van Dam attempted to hit Kane with a Van Daminator with the steel chair, but Kane rolled out of the ring to avoid the attack. Van Dam then attempted an aerial technique from inside the ring towards Kane, but Kane caught Van Dam in mid-air and executed an Tombstone Piledriver on the steel ring steps, after which he covered Van Dam for the pinfall to win the match.\nThe main event was the Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship, in which Triple H defended the title against Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels. The match began with Jericho and Michaels in the ring, while Goldberg, Nash, Orton, and Triple H were locked in the chambers. Michaels and Jericho wrestled, with neither of them gaining the advantage over the other. Orton and Nash were the third and fourth entrants into the match, respectively. Nash was the first wrestler eliminated from the match after Michaels executed a Sweet Chin Music and Jericho covered him for a pinfall. Triple H and Goldberg were the fifth and sixth entrants. Michaels performed another Sweet Chin Music on Triple H as soon as he exited his chamber, and as a result, Triple H was knocked back into his chamber. As soon as Goldberg entered the match, he performed a spear for a pinfall to eliminate Orton. Next, Goldberg performed a Jackhammer on both Michaels and Jericho, at one point spearing Jericho through a chamber pod, eliminating both via pinfall. This left Goldberg alone with and Triple H, who at the time had remained inside the chamber. Goldberg broke through the glass of his chamber, in the process dragging him out of the chamber. Ric Flair, who was managing both Triple H and Orton, then handed Triple H a sledgehammer. Goldberg attempted another spear on Triple H, who countered the maneuver by hitting Goldberg in the head with the sledgehammer and covered him for the pinfall, thus retaining the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Triple H, Orton and Flair launched a vicious 3-on-1 beatdown on Goldberg, ending with Triple H busting Goldberg open by repeatedly hitting him with his sledgehammer before yelling \"this is as close as you will ever get to my title!\" whilst holding the World Heavyweight Championship up to Goldberg's face.\nThis match was the second time that Triple H Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels participated after their previous encounter at Survivor Series (2002). Also, this was Randy Orton’s first participation inside the chamber and the only appearances of Goldberg and Kevin Nash.\nReception.\nThe America West Arena has a maximum capacity of 19,000, but that was reduced for SummerSlam 2003. The event grossed over US$715,000 in ticket sales from an attendance of 16,113, the maximum allowed. This was later confirmed by Linda McMahon, WWE CEO, in a press release on August 26, 2003. The event resulted in 415,000 pay-per-view buys (a 0.88 pay-per-view buyrate). The promotion's pay-per-view revenue was $24.7 million.\nCanadian Online Explorer's professional wrestling section rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars. The rating was higher than the SummerSlam event in 2004, which was rated a 5 out of 10 stars. The Elimination Chamber main event match from the Raw brand was rated an 9.6 out of 10 stars. The SmackDown! brand's main event, a standard match for the WWE Championship, was rated a 9 out of 10 stars, a lower reception than the Raw brand's main event. Wade Keller reviewed the event for the \"Pro Wrestling Torch\". He rated the Angle-Lesnar match 4-and-a-half out of 5 stars, declaring it an \"excellent match\". The Elimination Chamber match received a rating of 3 stars. The event was released on DVD on September 23, 2003 by Sony Music Entertainment.\nAftermath.\nDuring an episode of \"Raw\" after SummerSlam, Goldberg challenged Triple H to another match for the World Heavyweight Championship. This match took place at the Unforgiven pay-per-view on September 21, 2003, with a stipulation that, should he lose, Goldberg would retire from WWE. Goldberg defeated Triple H to become the new champion. After SummerSlam, Kurt Angle focused his attention on The Undertaker, whom he wrestled in a match for the WWE Championship during an episode of \"SmackDown!\" on September 4, 2003. During the match, Lesnar attacked both wrestlers with a folding chair, leading to an Iron Man match between Angle and Lesnar. Lesnar won five falls during the match, while Angle won four, and as a result Lesnar won the title.\nThe rivalry between Kane and Rob Van Dam was stopped, as Kane engaged in a feud against Shane McMahon. In a scenario on the August 25, 2003 episode of \"Raw\", Kane attempted to throw McMahon into a dumpster that was set on fire, but McMahon avoided it and threw Kane into the dumpster. On September 8, 2003, during an episode of \"Raw\", Eric Bischoff scheduled a Last Man Standing match between Kane and McMahon for Unforgiven. In that match, Kane defeated McMahon after McMahon was unable to respond to a ten count. After SummerSlam, Eddie Guerrero began a rivalry with John Cena over the WWE United States Championship. Guerrero retained the championship in two title defenses that took place on \"SmackDown!\". Guerrero then engaged in a feud with Big Show. At No Mercy, Big Show defeated Guerrero via pinfall to win the WWE United States Championship."

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 15, 2004, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one on the \"Sunday Night Heat\" pre-show. It was held during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in reference to the promotional poster.\nThe main match on the Raw brand was Chris Benoit versus Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Orton won by pinfall after performing an RKO. The predominant match on the SmackDown! brand was John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) versus The Undertaker for the WWE Championship, which JBL won after Undertaker was disqualified. The featured matches on the undercard included Kurt Angle versus Eddie Guerrero and Triple H versus Eugene.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2004 event was the 17th SummerSlam and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 15, 2004, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between Chris Benoit and Randy Orton, with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. At Vengeance, Benoit defeated Triple H to retain the title. On the July 26 episode of \"Raw\", Orton won a 20-man battle royal, last eliminating Chris Jericho, to become the number one contender to the title at SummerSlam. Also that night, Benoit defeated Triple H in a 60-minute Iron Man match to retain the title with the help of Eugene. On the August 2 episode of \"Raw\", Evolution (Orton, Batista, and Ric Flair) defeated Benoit, Edge, and Jericho in a six man tag team match when Orton pinned Benoit following an RKO. On the August 9 episode of \"Raw\", Benoit defeated Orton and Triple H in a Handicap match by disqualification.\nThe primary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker, over the WWE Championship. JBL had won the title two months prior at The Great American Bash by defeating then-champion Eddie Guerrero in a Texas Bullrope match. On the July 22 episode of \"SmackDown!\", JBL defeated a jobber to retain the title. After the match, Undertaker came out and challenged JBL to a match at SummerSlam. On the August 5 episode of \"SmackDown!\", as JBL called out Undertaker, a midget wrestler came out and began to imitate the real Undertaker. The real Undertaker came out shortly afterwards and attacked JBL, until Orlando Jordan came out to help him. On the August 12 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Undertaker defeated Jordan by disqualification after JBL interfered and executed a Clothesline from Hell on Undertaker.\nThe secondary feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. The feud first started at WrestleMania XX, when Guerrero defeated Angle to successfully retain the WWE Championship. Guerrero lost the title to John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) at The Great American Bash, when Angle, then-SmackDown! General Manager, screwed Guerrero and declared JBL the winner. On the July 15 episode of \"SmackDown!\", JBL defeated Guerrero in a Steel Cage match to retain the title. Towards the end of the match, El Gran Luchadore (portrayed by Angle) interfered, giving JBL enough time to escape the cage and win the match. After the match ended, Guerrero attacked El Gran Luchadore and pulled off his mask, revealing him to be Angle. On the July 22 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Vince McMahon fired Angle as SmackDown! General Manager and scheduled a match between Angle and Guerrero for SummerSlam.\nThe secondary feud on the Raw brand was between Triple H and Eugene. The feud first started on the May 17 episode of \"Raw\", during an in-ring segment with The Rock, Eugene revealed that his favorite wrestler was in fact Triple H due to Eugene's adoration of \"playing games\". Capitalizing on this opportunity, Triple H began to befriend the star-struck and naive Eugene even making the young wrestler an honorary member of Triple H's stable Evolution. However, Triple H soon revealed that this was all a calculated ploy and that he planned to utilize Eugene to help him win back the World Heavyweight Championship from Chris Benoit. Yet, Triple H's plan failed miserably when during his title match with Benoit at Vengeance, Eugene inadvertently hit him with a steel chair costing him the match and the championship. On the July 12 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H attacked Eugene in the ring after falsely implying that he had forgiven him for what happened at Vengeance. On the July 26 episode of \"Raw\", Eugene would return to exact a degree of revenge by costing Triple H his re-match with Benoit. On the August 2 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H demanded a match between the two at SummerSlam, to which Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff agreed.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Rob Van Dam defeated René Duprée in a match taped for \"Sunday Night Heat\". The first match was a six-man tag team match between The Dudleys (Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, and Spike Dudley) and the team of Rey Mysterio, Billy Kidman, and Paul London. Spike pinned Kidman after a 3D from Bubba Ray and D-Von to win the match for his team.\nThe next match was between Kane and Matt Hardy in a \"Till Death To Us Part\" match. Hardy gained control over Kane after performing a Twist of Fate on Kane outside of the ring and attacking him with the ring bell. Kane then countered a suplex attempt by Hardy into a chokeslam from the top rope to win the match. As a result of the pre-match stipulation, Lita was forced to marry Kane, as part of their on-going storyline.\nThe third match was between John Cena and Booker T in the first match of a \"Best of 5 series\" for the WWE United States Championship. Early in the match, Cena gained the advantage over Booker. In the end, Booker performed a scissors kick on Cena, who retaliated by performing an FU to win the match and go up 1-0 in the series.\nThe following match was a Triple Threat match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship involving Edge, Batista and Chris Jericho. During the match, Edge and Jericho performed double-team maneuvers onto Batista. Edge performed a spear on Jericho to retain the title.\nThe fifth match was between Kurt Angle and Eddie Guerrero. Angle gained control over Guerrero early on in the match. Mid-match, the referee was knocked out, and as a result, Guerrero took his boot off and used it to hit both Angle and Luther Reigns, who was at ringside with Angle and tried to get involved in the match. The match concluded when Angle was able to counter a frog splash and forced Guerrero to submit to the Ankle Lock.\nThe next match was between Triple H and Eugene. At the start of the match, Triple H pretended to attack the ring announcer, Lilian Garcia, as a distraction to attack Eugene. Eugene countered Triple H's attacks by executing a Rock Bottom. During the match, Ric Flair attempted to interfere but he was ejected by the referee. As Flair was leaving from ringside, William Regal hit Flair with a pair of brass knuckles. Triple H performed a Pedigree on Eugene to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nThe following match was for the WWE Championship between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker. Immediately, JBL and Undertaker started the match outside of the ring. Mid-match, the referee was knocked out. Orlando Jordan passed JBL the title belt, which JBL used to hit Undertaker with. Undertaker was disqualified after the referee saw him hit JBL with the title belt, meaning JBL retained the title. Undertaker executed a chokeslam to JBL through the roof of JBL's limousine, leading to JBL being taken out of the arena on a stretcher.\nThe main event was between Chris Benoit and Randy Orton for the World Heavyweight Championship. Orton attempted to apply a Sharpshooter on Benoit but Benoit applied a Sharpshooter on Orton. Later in the match, Benoit performed seven German suplexes on Orton but Orton blocked a diving headbutt. In the end, Benoit attempted to apply the Crippler Crossface but Orton countered into an RKO to win the title. Following the match whilst Orton was celebrating his victory, Benoit returned to the ring and offered Orton a handshake, telling him to \"be a man\", which Orton accepted.\nAftermath.\nOn the August 16 episode of \"Raw\", Randy Orton defeated Chris Benoit in a rematch to retain the World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, Evolution (Batista, Ric Flair, and Triple H), threw Orton a mock celebration, only to reveal that they were not pleased with his new victory. While Batista had Orton propped on his shoulders, Triple H gave him a pleased thumbs up, but abruptly changed it to a thumbs-down. He then told Batista to drop Orton to the mat, and Flair and Batista attacked Orton as Triple H told him that he was nothing without Evolution, and decided that Orton was on his own. On the August 23 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H told Orton to give him the title or \"pay the price\". Orton refused, and then he spat in Triple H's face and hit him with the title belt turning Orton into a face. Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff then scheduled a match between Orton and Triple H for the title at Unforgiven. At Unforgiven, Orton lost the title when he was pinned by Triple H.\nThe feud between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and The Undertaker continued. The next few weeks on \"SmackDown!\", JBL wore a neck brace, to signify that he was recuperating from Undertaker's chokeslam. On the August 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Orlando Jordan defended the WWE Championship for JBL against The Undertaker. Undertaker won the match via disqualification following interference from JBL; as a result, JBL retained the title. The following week on \"SmackDown!\", General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a Last Ride match at No Mercy between JBL and Undertaker. At No Mercy, JBL retained the title after interference by Heidenreich."

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown! brand divisions. The event took place on August 21, 2005, at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C. Nine matches were contested at the event, including one on the \"Sunday Night Heat\" pre-show.\nThe main match on the Raw brand was Hulk Hogan versus Shawn Michaels, which Hogan won by pinfall after executing a leg drop. The predominant match on the SmackDown brand was a No Holds Barred match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), which Batista won by pinfall after executing two Batista Bombs, with the second on the steel ring steps. Another primary match on the Raw brand was for the WWE Championship between John Cena and Chris Jericho, which Cena won by pinfall after performing an FU. The main match on the undercard featured a ladder match for the custody of Rey Mysterio's son Dominik between Mysterio and Eddie Guerrero, which Mysterio won by retrieving the briefcase suspended above the ring.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2005 event was the 18th event in the SummerSlam chronology and featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown! brands. It was scheduled to be held on August 21, 2005, at the MCI Center in Washington, D.C.\nWWE had originally planned a match between Muhammad Hassan and Batista for SmackDown!'s World Heavyweight Championship, which would have made Hassan the youngest world champion in WWE history at 23, breaking Randy Orton's record. The storyline was scheduled to begin at The Great American Bash in which he faced The Undertaker in a number one contenders match for the World Heavyweight Championship, but it was scrapped in the aftermath of the London bombings that occurred three days after \"SmackDown!\" was taped.\nStorylines.\nEight professional wrestling matches were scheduled on the event's card, which were planned with predetermined outcomes by WWE's script writers. The storylines revolving around these matches before, during, and after the event were also planned by the script writers. The event featured wrestlers and other talent from both the Raw and SmackDown! brands – a storyline expansion to which WWE assigned its employees. Wrestlers portrayed either a hero or villain gimmick, as they followed a series of events which generally built tension, leading to a wrestling match.\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between Hulk Hogan and Shawn Michaels. A feud between Michaels, and Muhammad Hassan and Daivari began on the April 4 episode of \"Raw\", when Hassan and Daivari attacked Michaels. Michaels demanded a match against the two, but he would only be given one if he found a partner. Hogan eventually became Michaels' partner, and they defeated Hassan and Daivari at Backlash. Hogan did not appear again until the July 4 episode of \"Raw\" in Carlito's talk show segment \"Carlito's Cabana\". Carlito, along with Kurt Angle, made comments about Hogan's daughter Brooke and eventually attacked him. Michaels came out to help Hogan, and they defeated Carlito and Angle in a match later that night. The match saw Hogan and Michaels get the victory. During the post-match pose, Michaels superkicked Hogan, which knocked Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning to the company in 2002. The following week, Michaels challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan accepted.\nThe predominant feud on the SmackDown! brand was between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL), with the two feuding over the World Heavyweight Championship. During the WWE Draft Lottery, SmackDown! was left temporarily without a top championship after John Cena, the reigning WWE Champion, was drafted to Raw. On the June 30 edition of \"SmackDown!\", a six-man elimination match between JBL, The Undertaker, Booker T, and SmackDown! draftees Chris Benoit, Christian, and Muhammad Hassan was made and General Manager Theodore Long was to present a new title to the winner called the SmackDown! Championship. JBL won the match by eliminating Christian last, but Long announced that plans had changed and there was no need for a SmackDown! Championship. Instead, Long revealed that Batista, who had been the reigning World Heavyweight Champion since defeating Triple H at WrestleMania 21, was joining the brand as the final draft pick and by winning the match, JBL was the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL faced Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at The Great American Bash, where JBL won by disqualification when Batista used a steel chair. JBL was given a rematch at SummerSlam on the following episode of \"SmackDown!\" after defeating The Undertaker. Batista allowed JBL to choose the stipulation, and JBL made it a No Holds Barred match. On the August 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", during Batista's match with Christian, JBL interfered and hit Batista with a steel chair. The following week, JBL faced Funaki in a No Holds Barred match, during which Batista interfered and attacked JBL.\nAnother rivalry leading into the event was between John Cena and Chris Jericho, with the two battling over the WWE Championship. Their feud began when Cena was drafted to Raw during the draft lottery and began a feud with Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff. Cena refused to comply with Bischoff, who saw Cena as an unfit champion. After Cena successfully defended the WWE Championship in a triple threat match at Vengeance against Jericho and Christian, Bischoff hand-picked Jericho to face Cena for the WWE Championship at SummerSlam. On the August 1 episode of \"Raw\", Jericho refereed a WWE Championship match between Cena and Carlito (which Cena won). After the match, Jericho attacked Cena with a television camera. On the August 15 episode of \"Raw\", Cena defeated Jericho and Carlito in a handicap match. At the end, Jericho hit Cena with a steel chair.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event officially began, Chris Masters defeated The Hurricane in a match taped for \"Sunday Night Heat\".\nIn the first match, Orlando Jordan faced Chris Benoit for the United States Championship. The match started with both locked up in a collar-and-elbow. Benoit forced Jordan into the corner, and as the referee was trying to break them up, Jordan punched Benoit. Benoit then avoided a clothesline and performed a German suplex. Benoit applied the Crippler Crossface to force Jordan to submit to win the match and the title in 25.5 seconds.\nIn the second match, Edge faced Matt Hardy. Fueled by a storyline stemming from previous real-life tensions between the two former friends over Hardy's real-life girlfriend Lita having an affair with Edge, the fight started outside the ring, with Hardy gaining the early advantage. After repeated punches, Hardy applied a rear naked choke. Edge fought back with a headbutt and punches. Edge then performed a spear to the outside. Both were down briefly before Edge brought Hardy back into the ring. Hardy fought back with punches and mounted punches in the corner. During this, Edge pushed Hardy upwards, causing his head to hit the ringpost and bleed. Edge attacked Hardy's head repeatedly, and Hardy was incapable of defending himself. The referee finally stopped the match and awarded Edge the victory. This match, seen by many as a disappointment, was highly anticipated due to the WWE's storyline exploiting real life events between Edge and Hardy.\nThe third match was a Ladder match between Eddie Guerrero and Rey Mysterio for the custody of Dominik. A briefcase with legal documents inside was suspended above the ring. After throwing Mysterio into the steel steps, Guerrero ascended a ladder. Mysterio performed a springboard dropkick to knock down the ladder. Mysterio then performed a dropkick, sending the ladder into Guerrero's face, and a springboard seated senton to the outside. Guerrero then performed a powerbomb off the ladder, and a Hilo to Mysterio, who was sandwiched between two ladders. Both ascended the ladder again, and Mysterio performed a back body drop onto another ladder. Guerrero performed an Alley Oop to Mysterio onto a ladder balanced on the top rope. As Guerrero ascended the ladder, Dominick entered the ring and attempted to shake the ladder. Guerrero confronted him and, as he was about to attack him, Mysterio fought off Guerrero and performed a 619 and a Droppin' Da Dime with the ladder. Both attempted to obtain the briefcase, but was stopped by the other. After Guerrero performed the Three Amigos onto a ladder, he ascended the ladder, but Vickie Guerrero came down and pushed down the ladder. She then held onto Eddie as Mysterio retrieved the briefcase to win the match.\nThe fourth match was between Eugene and Kurt Angle for the Olympic gold medal that originally belonged to Angle. Angle gained the early advantage with repeated short-arm clotheslines. Eugene then countered with a spinebuster and attempted a People's Elbow, but Angle performed a clothesline. Angle then performed several German suplexes. Eugene fought back and performed a Rock Bottom. Eugene then performed a Stone Cold Stunner and applied the ankle lock. Angle countered and performed an Angle Slam. He then applied the ankle lock and forced Eugene to submit to win the match. After the match, Angle threw Eugene out of the ring and had the referee place the gold medal around his neck.\nThe fifth match was between The Undertaker and Randy Orton. The Undertaker gained the advantage after a leaping flying clothesline and attacks in the corner. Orton gained the advantage by avoiding a big boot. Orton then attacked The Undertaker's left knee. The Undertaker eventually countered an attack by sending Orton outside the ring. The Undertaker then performed a guillotine leg drop to Orton, who was on the apron. The Undertaker then performed an Old School and a reverse STO. The Undertaker then performed a Snake Eyes, but Orton came back with a dropkick. The Undertaker avoided an RKO attempt and attempted a Tombstone Piledriver, which Orton countered into an inverted headlock backbreaker. Orton then performed a crossbody, but The Undertaker rolled through and performed a chokeslam. A fan then entered the ring and distracted The Undertaker, allowing Orton to perform an RKO and win the match. Orton then revealed the fan to be \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton in disguise.\nMain event matches.\nIn the sixth match, John Cena faced Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship. Jericho gained the early advantage until missing a springboard crossbody to the outside. Cena fought back briefly, but Jericho fought back, dropkicking and superplexing Cena. Cena fought back with a back body drop, but missed a leaping shoulder block. Jericho then delivered a one-handed bulldog, but missed a lionsault. Jericho countered an FU attempt and attempted to apply the Walls of Jericho, but Cena kicked Jericho outside. Cena performed a diving leg drop bulldog and attempted an FU, but Jericho countered into a DDT. Jericho then performed a pendulum backbreaker and repeated elbow drops to Cena's back. Cena fought back and performed a spin-out powerbomb. He then attempted a Five Knuckle Shuffle, but Jericho countered and applied the Walls of Jericho. He then performed a belly to back suplex from the top rope. As he attempted another attack, Cena countered into an FU to win the match and retain his title.\nThe seventh match was a No Holds Barred match between John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) and Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship. JBL attacked Batista during his entrance, and they fought on the entrance ramp and at ringside, using several weapons. Batista performed a spear to JBL through the security wall. JBL shoved Batista into the ringpost and continued to beat down Batista after a short-arm clothesline. He then whipped and choked Batista with a leather belt. Batista fought back with a belly to back suplex and whipped JBL with the belt. JBL fought back, performing a Clothesline from Hell for a near-fall and bringing the steel steps into the ring. He attempted an attack on the steps, but Batista countered with a back body drop. He then performed a spinebuster and two Batista Bombs, with the second onto the steel steps, to win the match and retain his title.\nThe main event was between Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan. This was Hogan's first SummerSlam appearance since 1991. During Hogan's entrance, a huge American flag unrolled from the top of the stage and covered the entire set. The match started slowly, until Hogan sent Michaels outside. Hogan performed a scoop slam on the announce table and sent Michaels into the ringpost. Michaels reversed another attempt and sent Hogan into the ringpost twice. Michaels continued to attack his head with punches and mounted punches and applied the sleeper hold. Hogan fought out of it with a belly to back suplex, but failed to gain the advantage as Michaels performed a flying forearm smash. Michaels then missed a diving elbow drop, and Hogan fought back briefly. Michaels performed another flying forearm smash and applied the sharpshooter. Hogan broke the hold and avoided another attempt by kicking Michaels into the referee. Michaels performed a low blow and hit Hogan with a steel chair. Michaels then performed a diving elbow drop and a superkick. Michaels attempted a pinfall but Hogan kicked out at a two count. Hogan then delivered a big boot and a leg drop to win the match. After the match, Michaels extended his hand to Hogan saying, \"I needed to know and I found out,\" and Hogan shook his hand.\nAftermath.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Eric Bischoff made a You're Fired match between John Cena and Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship. Although Bischoff interfered, Cena won the match, and Jericho was fired. Immediately after the match, Kurt Angle attacked Cena and was revealed to be Bischoff's new hand-picked representative to win the title from Cena. Angle and Cena feuded until the start of 2006, with Angle unable to win the title, and Bischoff being fired.\nThe feud between Batista and John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield (JBL) ended when Batista defeated JBL in a Texas Bullrope match on the September 9 episode of \"SmackDown!\". Batista then began a storyline with Eddie Guerrero when Guerrero was given a title match at No Mercy, and the two became friends. This storyline ended prematurely due to Guerrero's unexpected death on November 13.\nThe feud between Matt Hardy and Edge continued with a Street Fight on the August 29 episode of \"Raw\" (which ended in a no contest) and a Steel Cage match at Unforgiven (which Hardy won), and it ended with Hardy losing a Loser Leaves Raw Ladder match on the October 3 episode of \"Raw\". The feud between The Undertaker and Randy Orton continued with a Handicap Casket match at No Mercy, where The Undertaker lost to Randy and \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton. After the match, Randy and Bob poured gasoline on the casket and set it ablaze. The Undertaker had vanished from the casket, and their feud briefly went on hiatus until Survivor Series. Shawn Michaels started a feud with Chris Masters when Masters interrupted Michaels, wanting to take the spotlight. The feud between Chris Benoit and Orlando Jordan continued with Jordan losing in rematches, lasting less than a minute each.\nIn mid-2006, WWE launched a third brand dubbed ECW, which featured wrestlers from the former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion, as well as newer talent. Additionally, the ECW World Heavyweight Championship was reactivated to be the brand's top championship, and third concurrently active world title in WWE."

        "title": "2010 FIFA World Cup qualification",
        "text": "Qualifying for the 2010 FIFA World Cup was a series of tournaments organised by the six FIFA confederations. Each confederation – the AFC (Asia), CAF (Africa), CONCACAF (North, Central America and Caribbean), CONMEBOL (South America), OFC (Oceania), and UEFA (Europe) – was allocated a certain number of the 32 places at the tournament. A total of 205 teams entered the qualification competition, with South Africa, as the host, qualifying for the World Cup automatically. The first qualification matches were played on 25 August 2007 and qualification concluded on 18 November 2009. Overall, 2,338 goals were scored over 852 matches, scoring on average 2.74 per match.\nEntrants.\nAt the close of entries on 15 March 2007, 204 football associations had entered the preliminary competition: 203 out of the 207 FIFA members at that time (including the host nation, South Africa, as the qualification procedure in Africa also acted as the qualification for the 2010 African Cup of Nations) and the Montenegro team, which later became FIFA's 208th member. The final number of teams entered breaks the previous record of 199 entrants set during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Four FIFA members (all from the AFC) failed to register for the tournament by 15 March 2007: Bhutan, Brunei, Laos, and the Philippines.\nAfter the close of entries, Bhutan were allowed to enter and were included in the Asian preliminary draw, while Brunei and the Philippines had their late entries rejected.\nHowever, five teams withdrew during qualifying without playing a match: Bhutan, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Guam, and São Tomé and Príncipe. In addition, Papua New Guinea failed to meet the registration deadline for the South Pacific Games (which was also the initial stage of the Oceania qualification) and took no part in qualification.\nQualified teams.\nThe following 32 teams qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup:\nQualification process.\nThe qualification process commenced in August 2007 and was completed in November 2009. An initial draw for preliminary qualification (qualifying groups in Oceania, and knockout ties in CAF and AFC) had been announced for Zurich on 28 May 2007, but none was held.\nInitial groups for the Oceania qualification were eventually held in Auckland, New Zealand, in early June, with preliminary draws for the Asian and African qualification announced in August.\nThe draw for the main 2010 World Cup qualifying groups was held in Durban, South Africa on 25 November 2007. 34 teams had been eliminated before the actual draw – 6 from OFC, 5 from CAF and 23 from AFC – and CONMEBOL qualification also had started (no draw was required for this confederation, as all 10 members play in the same group, with the order of fixtures the same as for the 2006 qualification rounds). The four remaining teams from OFC had also started playing the final stage as a single group, and no draw was needed. Therefore, the draw of 25 November involved 156 FIFA members from the original 205 entries, divided as follows: UEFA–53 entries in draw; CAF–48 entries in draw (original 53 minus 5 preliminary round losers and withdrawals); AFC–20 entries in draw (original 43 minus 23 1st and 2nd round losers and withdrawals); and CONCACAF–35 entries in draw.\nThe distribution by confederation for the 2010 World Cup was:\nUEFA and CAF had a guaranteed number of places, whereas the number of qualifiers from other confederations was dependent on play-offs between the highest placed teams in the qualification tournaments not guaranteed a place in the finals, with CONCACAF's fourth-place team facing CONMEBOL's fifth-placed team, and AFC's fifth-placed team facing the winners from the OFC.\nAs the host nation, South Africa qualified automatically. As in 2006, the current cup holders – Italy – did not qualify automatically.\nTiebreakers.\nFor FIFA World Cup qualifying stages the method used for separating teams level on points is the same for all Confederations, as decided by FIFA itself. If teams were even on points at the end of group play, the tied teams would be ranked by:\nThis is a change from 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, where results between tied teams was the first tiebreaker.\nConfederation qualification.\nAFC.\n\"(43 teams competing for 4 or 5 berths; a play-off against OFC determines which confederation gets the extra berth)\"\nTwo preliminary rounds (one in October 2007 and one in the first half of November) narrowed the field from 43 to 20 prior to the group stage draw in Durban on 25 November 2007.\nThe group stage draw divided the 20 remaining sides into five groups of four, which were played from February to June 2008, from which the winners and runners-up advanced to the final group stage. The winners and runners-up from two final groups of five nations (playing from September 2008 to June 2009) will qualify automatically for the World Cup finals, with the two third-placed sides playing off in September 2009 for the right to compete against the Oceania winner for a final qualification spot (with matches played in October and November 2009).\nThe knock-out preliminary rounds themselves were somewhat unusual, with all 38 AFC sides that did not qualify for the 2006 World Cup playing in the first knock-out round, but the 11 best-ranked winners from that round receiving byes in the second round (and only the eight lowest-ranked winners competing to reduce the fields of teams to 20).\nPlay-off for fifth place (fifth round).\n2–2 on aggregate; Bahrain advanced on the away goals rule to the AFC-OFC play-off against New Zealand, the winners from the OFC zone (2008 OFC Nations Cup).\nCAF.\n\"(53 teams competing for 5 berths, host South Africa occupying a 6th berth)\"\nThe CAF qualification process began with a preliminary round played on 13 October and 17 November 2007 to narrow the field to 48 teams, and then 12 groups of four teams were drawn in Durban in November 2007.\nThe 12 groups winners and eight best runners-up advanced to the next stage. The procedure was complicated due to two of the groups being reduced to just three teams due to the withdrawal of Eritrea (before the commencement of the group) and the exclusion of Ethiopia (which saw all their results annulled). As a result, the comparison of the 12 runners-up did not include results against teams finishing fourth in 4-team groups.\nThe remaining 20 teams were placed in five groups of four teams at a draw held in Zürich on 22 October 2008. The winners of these groups qualified for the World Cup finals.\nThe qualifying competition for the 2010 World Cup was combined with the qualification process for the 2010 African Cup of Nations. Since South Africa was hosting the World Cup, it automatically qualified for that tournament, although it (unlike hosts in previous qualifying tournaments since 1938) played in the qualifiers themselves to facilitate the use of the same set of qualifying matches for the 2010 African Cup of Nations.\nHad South Africa advanced to the third round (second group stage), their matches would not have been counted in determining who advances to the World Cup finals. However, South Africa were eliminated from the qualifiers after the second round. This meant that they could not qualify for the African Cup of Nations, and all matches in Round 3 counted towards World Cup qualification.\nFinal positions (third round).\nIn Group C, Algeria and Egypt finished with identical overall and head-to-head records. A tiebreaking play-off was contested on 18 November 2009 in Sudan to determine which team would qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, with Algeria prevailing 1–0.\nCONCACAF.\n\"(35 teams competing for 3 or 4 berths; a play-off against CONMEBOL determines which confederation gets the extra berth)\"\nThe CONCACAF qualification process is identical to that for the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification, except that as Puerto Rico competed this time (they were the only CONCACAF member not to enter 2006 qualification), there were 11 matches instead of 10 in the first preliminary round, and thus 13 teams instead of 14 received a bye to the second preliminary round. The two preliminary rounds, played in the first half of 2008, reduced the 35 entrants to 24 and then 12 teams. Three semi-final groups of four were played between August and November 2008, with the top two in each group advancing to a final six-team group held during 2009. The top three of this group qualified for the World Cup finals; the fourth-placed team advancing to the play-off against the fifth-placed CONMEBOL team.\nFinal positions (fourth round).\nHonduras advanced on goal difference tiebreaker. \"Costa Rica\" moved to the CONCACAF/CONMEBOL intercontinental play-off.\nCONMEBOL.\n\"(10 teams competing for 4 or 5 berths; a play-off against CONCACAF determined which confederation filled the extra berth)\"\nThe CONMEBOL qualification process again featured a league system (home and away matches) for a single group of 10 associations, with matches played from October 2007 to October 2009. The fixture list was identical to that used in the qualification for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. To limit the amount of travel by European-based players to South America, CONMEBOL's schedule used nine 'double match days' (with two sets of matches held within a few days of each other). The top four teams qualified for the World Cup finals; the fifth-placed team advancing to a play-off against the fourth-placed CONCACAF team.\nOFC.\n\"(10 teams competing for 0 or 1 berth; a play-off against AFC determines which confederation gets the extra berth. Tuvalu also played in the qualifying tournament, but was not an entrant to the World Cup qualification)\"\nThe qualification process began with a tournament at the 2007 South Pacific Games in August 2007. The top three (New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu, respectively) joined New Zealand in a 4-team group, which was also the 2008 OFC Nations Cup, playing home and away. The winners would play a home-and-away play-off with the fifth-placed Asian nation for a World Cup berth.\nFinal positions (second round).\nNew Zealand advanced to the AFC-OFC play-off, against Bahrain, the fifth-placed team from the AFC.\nUEFA.\n\"(53 teams competing for 13 berths)\"\nThe European qualification games started in August 2008 after Euro 2008. Eight groups of six teams and one group of five contested the European qualifying competition. As a result, the nine group winners qualified directly, while the best eight of the nine second-placed teams contested home and away play-off matches for the remaining four places. In determining the best eight second-placed teams, the results against teams finishing last in the six-team groups were not counted for consistency between the five- and six-team groups.\nThe First Round was completed on 14 October 2009. A draw for the Second Round was held in Zürich on 19 October, with the matches played on 14 and 18 November.\nSecond round.\nThe Second Round was contested by the top eight runners-up. With one group having one team fewer than the others, matches against the sixth-placed team in each of the other groups were not included in this ranking.\nThe draw for the second round play-offs was held in Zürich on 19 October, and the matches were played on 14 and 18 November 2009. The eight teams were seeded according to the FIFA World Rankings released on 16 October. The top four teams were seeded into one pot, with the bottom four teams seeded into a second. A separate draw was conducted between each matchup to decide who would host the first leg.\nFrance, Portugal, Greece and Slovenia qualified for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThere were two scheduled inter-confederation play-offs to determine the final two qualification spots to the finals. The matches were played in October and November 2009.\nThe draw for the order in which the matches were to be played was held on 2 June 2009 during the FIFA Congress in Nassau, The Bahamas.\nQualification controversies.\nControversy surrounded several of the final qualification matches in November 2009. \nIn the second leg of the play-off between France and the Republic of Ireland, French captain Thierry Henry, unseen by the referee, twice illegally handled the ball in the lead up to the decisive goal, which saw France make the final 32 teams ahead of Ireland. The incident caused widespread debate on FIFA Fair Play, and how matches should be refereed at the highest level. The Football Association of Ireland requested a replay on grounds of fairness, but this was denied by FIFA under the Laws of the Game. A widely reported later request by Ireland to be included as an unprecedented 33rd World Cup entrant was later withdrawn by the FAI, and dismissed by the FAI as peripheral to their other more substantial petitions for change in world football made to FIFA.\nCosta Rica also complained over Uruguay's winning goal in the CONMEBOL–CONCACAF play-off.\nThere was crowd trouble around two matches between Egypt and Algeria, with the Algerian team bus stoned before the first in Cairo, and reports of Egyptian fans ambushed after the second in Khartoum, Sudan. Local media made lurid reports, and diplomatic relations between the countries nosedived.\nIn response to the incidents during qualification, and to a match fixing controversy, on 2 December 2009 FIFA called for an extraordinary general meeting of their executive committee. After the meeting, FIFA announced that they would be setting up an inquiry into technology and extra officials in the game, but they did not announce the widely expected move of fast-tracking the introduction of goal-line referee's assistants, already being trialled in the Europa League, and instead restated that the competition in South Africa would be officiated as before, with just one referee, two assistants, and a fourth official. On the subject of fair play, FIFA President Sepp Blatter said:\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are goalscorer lists for all confederations and the inter-confederation play-offs:"

        "title": "World Rugby Rankings",
        "text": "The World Rugby Rankings is a ranking system for national teams in rugby union, managed by World Rugby, the sport's governing body. There are separate men's and women's rankings. The teams of World Rugby's member nations are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. A point system is used, with points being awarded on the basis of the results of World Rugby-recognized international matches. Rankings are based on the team's performance, with more recent results and more significant matches being more heavily weighted to help reflect the current competitive state of a team. The men's ranking system was introduced the month before the 2003 Rugby World Cup, with the first new rankings issued on 8 September 2003, when they were called the \"IRB Rankings\".\nRankings.\nRank leaders.\n World Rugby Ranking Leaders&lt;br&gt;\nWhen the system was introduced England were the top team and maintained that position following victory in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. New Zealand took the lead from 14 June 2004.\nAfter winning the 2007 Rugby World Cup final, South Africa became the third team to achieve first place. The first two fixtures of the 2008 Tri Nations resulted in the top two teams switching places: the All Blacks regained the top spot after defeating South Africa in the Tri-Nations opener on 5 July 2008 in Wellington; a week later the Springboks returned the favour in Dunedin, scoring their first win over the All Blacks in New Zealand since 1998, reclaiming the top spot, only for the All Blacks to defeat both Australia and South Africa in August 2008 to regain the top spot by a considerable margin. South Africa regained the lead in July 2009 after beating New Zealand in Bloemfontein and kept the lead until losing to France in November of that year, allowing the All Blacks to regain the top spot.\nA change at the top would not occur for a record period of 508 weeks (from 16 November 2009 to 19 August 2019), when Wales became the top ranked team for the first time after defeating England at Cardiff in a World Cup 2019 warm-up test in August, following on a streak in which they won 15 of 16 tests, including a Six Nations Grand Slam. Two weeks later New Zealand returned to the top of the summit following Ireland's victory over Wales in Cardiff in a World Cup 2019 warm-up test. However, on 7 September 2019, Ireland defeated Wales again, this time in Dublin, and they were installed as the number 1 team for the first time in their history, which they held entering the 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nThe first round of matches in the 2019 Rugby World Cup saw a further change at the top, with New Zealand's pool stage victory over the Springboks seeing them regain the top spot. England's defeat of New Zealand in the 2019 World Cup semi-finals saw them return to the top spot for the first time since 2004. A week later, South Africa reclaimed top spot after defeating England in the final.\n2021 saw the ranking lead change several times with South Africa and New Zealand each holding the top spot at various points. In 2022, France replaced South Africa on top of the rankings following their victory over Japan in their summer tour and the Springboks' home defeat by a touring Wales team. A week later, Ireland claimed top spot following victory in their summer tour to New Zealand.\nSince the rankings began, the winners of every edition of the World Cup have held the number 1 spot at the end of the tournament.\nNew Zealand have been the most consistently ranked #1 team since the introduction of the world rankings in 2003, having held the #1 ranking for most of the time during this period. South Africa is second, with Ireland, England, Wales and France making up the remainder.\nTo date, 2019 is the only calendar year in which more than three nations have held the number 1 spot - with five nations holding that title at some point during the year.\nBest and worst ranking positions.\nBelow is a list of the best and worst ranking positions for nations that have appeared in the Rugby World Cup:\nRating leaders.\nAccording to World Rugby the \"top side in the World will normally have a rating above 90\", however, this is not always the case. New Zealand retained the number 1 position in August 2019 following defeat by Australia at Perth in the Rugby Championship, despite their ratings falling to 89.04. A week later, Wales increased their rating to 89.43 and claimed the top spot by beating England at Cardiff in a World Cup 2019 warm-up test. In contrast, some countries that have reached a rating of over 90 rating points, such as Australia (91.75) and Ireland (91.17), did not achieve the top spot, although Ireland would eventually reach the top of the summit with a rating of 89.47 following their victory over Wales in a World Cup 2019 warm-up test in Dublin, while Australia still to date have never attained the number 1 ranked position. This is due to the success of New Zealand who had been rated above 90 rating points for a record of 509 weeks and 6 days (from 2 November 2009 to 11 August 2019), which ended following the aforementioned defeat to Australia.\nNew Zealand also holds the record for the highest rating points amassed by any team, which currently stands at 96.57. England first held the record at 93.99 on the 24 November 2003, following their World Cup win in Australia; however, New Zealand surpassed this on 28 August 2006 with a rating of 94.62, following their Tri Nations victory over South Africa in Pretoria. The All Blacks would go on to push this record further over the years, reaching 95.01 points on the 25 June 2007 after beating South Africa in Durban, 96.10 points after their 2015 World Cup win in England and 96.30 points on 22 August 2016, following their Rugby Championship victory over Australia in Sydney, to its current record of 96.57, which they attained on 10 October 2016 after defeating South Africa in Durban. New Zealand's defeat by Ireland at Soldier Field, Chicago as part of the Autumn International Test Series in November 2016 ended their record streak.\nMost and least accumulated ratings.\nBelow is a list of the most and least accumulated rating points for each of the nations that have appeared in the Rugby World Cup since the ranking tables were first published on the 13 October 2003:\nList of rankings leader.\nSummary \nCurrent calculation method.\nAll World Rugby member countries have been given a rating that is in the range of 0 to 100 with the top side achieving a rating of about 90 points. The point system is calculated using a 'Points Exchange' system, in which sides receive points from each other on the basis of the match result – whatever one side gains, the other loses. The exchanges are based on the match result, the ranking of each team, and the margin of victory, with an allowance for home advantage. As the system aims to depict current team strengths, past successes or losses will fade and be superseded by more recent results. Thus, it is thought that it will produce an accurate picture depicting the actual current strength and thus rank of the nations. The rankings are responsive to results and it is possible to climb to the top from the bottom (and vice versa) in fewer than 20 matches. As all matches are worth a net of 0 points for the two teams combined, there is no particular advantage to playing more matches. A rating stays the same until the team plays again. Although matches often result in points exchanges, 'predictable' results lead to very minor changes, and may result in no change to either side's rating.\nRules.\nThe system ensures that it is representative of the teams' performance despite playing differing numbers of matches each year, and the differing strength of opposition that teams have to face. The factors taken into account are as follows:\nMatch result.\nFor each match played points exchanges are awarded for the following five outcomes and was developed using results of international matches from 1871 to the present day: \nMatch status.\nDifferent matches have different importance to teams, and World Rugby has tried to reflect this by using a weighting system, where the most significant matches are in the Rugby World Cup Finals. Points exchanges are doubled during the World Cup Finals to recognise the unique importance of this event. All other full international matches are treated the same, to be as fair as possible to countries playing a different mix of friendly and competitive matches. Matches that do not have full international status do not count.\nOpposition strength.\nA win against a very highly ranked opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, so the strength of the opposing team is a factor. Thus match results are more important than margins of victory in producing accurate rankings. This is because when a highly ranked team plays a lowly ranked team and manages to beat them by over 50 points, it does not necessarily indicate how either team will perform in the future.\nHome advantage.\nWhen calculating points exchanges, the home side is handicapped by treating them as though they are three rating points better than their current rating. This results in the home side gaining fewer points for winning and losing more points for losing. Because of this, ideally, any advantage that a side may have by playing in front of their home crowd is cancelled out.\nHow to calculate the Points Exchange.\n[1] Take the pre-match Points Ranking Score of Team Y. \nIf Y has home advantage, add 3 to its pre-match Points Ranking Score. \nThis is the “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” for Team Y. \nCall it “A”.\n[2] Take the pre-match Points Ranking Score of Team Z. \nIf Z has home advantage, add 3 to its pre-match Points Ranking Score.\nThis is the “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” for Team Z.\nCall it “B”.\n[3] Calculate the Difference between the two “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Scores”. \nCall it “D”.\n[4] Apply the formula from the relevant item in this list:\n\"World Cup Matches\" \n... Team Y wins by 16 or more points ... (10+B-A) x 0.3 capped at 6\n... Team Y wins by 15 or fewer points ... (10+B-A) x 0.2 capped at 4\n... The match is a draw [**see note 9] ... D x 0.2 capped at 2\n... Team Z wins by 15 or fewer points ... (10+A-B) x 0.2 capped at 4\n... Team Z wins by 16 or more points ... (10+A-B) x 0.3 capped at 6 \n\"Other International\"\n... Team Y wins by 16 or more points ... (10+B-A) x 0.15 capped at 3\n... Team Y wins by 15 or fewer points ... (10+B-A) x 0.1 capped at 2\n... The match is a draw [**see note 9] ... D x 0.1 capped at 1\n... Team Z wins by 15 or fewer points ... (10+A-B) x 0.1 capped at 2\n... Team Z wins by 16 or more points ... (10+A-B) x 0.15 capped at 3\n[5] The team with the higher “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” may be termed the “Favourite”.\n[6] The team with the lower “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” may be termed the “Underdog”.\n[7] A team whose “Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” is 10+ points lower than their opponents’ \"Modified pre-match Points Ranking Score” may be termed the “Outsider”.\n[8] An \"Underdog\" stands to gain more from a victory than does a \"Favourite\".\n[9] In the case of a draw, the points are transferred from the “Favourite” to the “Underdog” or “Outsider”. The transfer is capped at 1 (2 in a World Cup Match).\n[10] There is no transfer of points if a “Favourite” beats an “Outsider”.\nNew and dormant nations.\nAll new member nations start with 30.00 points, which is provisional until they have completed ten test matches. When countries merge, the new country inherits the higher rating of the two countries but when they split e.g., the 2010 breakup of the Arabian Gulf rugby union team into separate teams representing its current member countries, the new countries will inherit a rating at a fixed level below the rating of the original country.\nBefore 1 December 2012 new member nations were given 40.00 points.\nCountries that have not played a test for a number of years are removed from the ranking system and the list. If they become active again, they resume their previous rating."

In the opening game against Scotland, the Ivory Coast lost by 89 points to nil, a result which led many to question the inclusion of \"minor\" teams in the tournament. Worse still, three minutes into the third match, against Tonga, their winger Max Brito was crushed beneath several other players. Despite intensive care, Brito was left paralyzed below the neck. He had caught a high ball that had been kicked up the field, and set off on a counter-attack. He was tackled by Inoke Afeaki, the Tonga flanker, before a ruck formed over him. The ruck collapsed and several players fell on top of Brito, leaving him prone and motionless on the ground. Brito was taken to the intensive care unit of the Unitas Hospital in Pretoria with broken vertebrae. Operations were carried out to stabilize the fourth and fifth vertebrae, but Brito was left paralyzed below the neck.\nIn a 2007 interview, Brito was portrayed as living an unhappy life. He was quoted as saying that\nBrito's injury raised concerns about the presence of such teams in a rugby union environment on the brink of professionalisation.\nOverall record.\n1995 Rugby World Cup.\nPool D matches -"

        "title": "Spinning (cycling)",
        "text": "Spinning is a brand of indoor bicycles and indoor cycling instruction classes distributed and licensed by the American health and fitness company Mad Dogg Athletics. Launched in 1993, the brand has become a popular term to refer to indoor bicycles and indoor cycling fitness classes in the United States and throughout the world. \nHistory.\nThe Spinning indoor cycling program was developed by South African endurance bicycle racer Johnny Goldberg (known as Johnny G) in the mid-1980s after he was struck by a car while training for a race at night. Goldberg's early Spinning prototypes were targeted toward endurance athletes as a substitute for outdoor bicycle training, and allowed the athlete to train year-round regardless of outdoor weather conditions.\nIn 1989 Goldberg opened the Johnny G Spinning Center, in Santa Monica, California, with bikes he built. In 1992 he moved the class to Karen Voight Fitness, in Hollywood, for more exposure. In 1993 Goldberg and his business partner, cycling enthusiast John Baudhuin, launched the Spinning indoor cycling fitness program in Santa Monica, California, through their business entity Mad Dogg Athletics, Inc. The first Spinning brand indoor cycling programs were held in Crunch gyms in New York, but were only regionally popular at that time. By 1994, however, Spinning had made national news on Rolling Stone Magazine’s “hot list\" as the ‘hot exercise’ you need to try.” \nGoldberg and Baudhuin made a deal with Schwinn, which debuted bikes at a trade show in 1995. The Spinning program expanded in the United States and globally. By 1996 there were more than a thousand Official Spinning Facilities spanning over 30 countries. Goldberg and Baudhuin trained thousands of instructors. “It was unique—the first time equipment, training, and philosophy were sold together,” Goldberg said in 2004.\nIn 2003 Star Trac became the bike manufacturer. In 2004 Goldberg retired from Mad Dogg Athletics and the Spinning brand.\nIn 2015 Mad Dogg Athletics partnered with Precor to create a new line of commercial Spinning bikes. \nMad Dogg Athletics has trained over 200,000 instructors in its Spinning program and has a network of over 35,000 fitness facilities.\nMad Dogg Athletics claims trademark ownership for the terms Spin, Spinner, Spinning, Spin Fitness, SPINPower, and the Spinning logo, among others.\nPossible generic term.\nMad Dogg Athletics has registered Spinning as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic.\nMad Dogg Athletics continues to defend the Spinning trademark against its generic use and has recently expanded its focus and efforts on brand protection.\nBased on the brand's widespread popularity, it has potentially become a generic term for indoor cycling in the Czech Republic. However, in November 2018, the General Court (European Union) upheld Mad Dogg's rights and found that the brand was not a generic term.\nRelated products.\nTo protect its trademark for the term Spinning, Mad Dogg Athletics commonly refers to its products and services as the \"SPINNING brand\", \"SPINNING indoor cycling\", \"SPINNING certification\", and similar terms, not just \"Spinning\"."

The Senators defeated Vancouver three games to two in the best-of-five game series to become the first team to win back-to-back Cup championships since the 1912/1913 Quebec Bulldogs.\nPaths to the Finals.\nOttawa won the first half of the 1920–21 NHL regular season while the Toronto St. Patricks won the second half, setting up a two-game total goals series between the two clubs to determine the NHL title. The Senators recorded 5–0 and 2–0 shutout victories to advance to the Cup final. The first NHL players strike almost took place before the second game when Toronto's players balked at playing extra games. However, team manager Charlie Querrie agreed to give the players a bonus for the playoffs.\nMeanwhile, Vancouver finished the 1920–21 PCHA regular season in first place with a 13–11 record, and defeated the second place Seattle Metropolitans in a championship series to win the PCHA title.\nGame summaries.\nThe series took place at Vancouver's Denman Arena, where the attendance per game during the series averaged over 10,000 people. The attendance for the first game was 11,000, setting a new world record for the largest crowd to see a hockey game, only to be topped in the fifth game. The Millionaires won games one and four with victories of 3–1 and 3–2, respectively. The Senators were victorious in games two and three with 4–3 and 3–2 wins. Then in the fifth game, Jack Darragh scored both of Ottawa's goals in the 2–1 victory to clinch the Cup.\nIn game one, played under western rules of seven-men hockey, the Millionaires took a 2–0 lead after the first period on goals by Alf Skinner and Art Duncan. Smokey Harris scored in the second to stretch the lead to 3–0 before Darragh put Ottawa on the board with five minutes to play in the second. The third period was scoreless, giving the first win and the series lead to the Millionaires. Skinner was badly cut in the game and was sent to the hospital.\nIn game two, played under eastern rules of six-man hockey, the Millionaires took the lead 3–2 after one period on goals by Harris, Duncan and Jack Adams. Ottawa tied it the second on a goal by Darragh. Punch Broadbent scored the winning goal with four minutes to play in the third period.\nGame three was again played under western rules. Skinner remained out. Lloyd Cook opened the scoring for Vancouver in the second minute but Darragh countered for Ottawa five minutes later. Ottawa took the lead in the second with goals by Cy Denneny and Sprague Cleghorn before Jack Adams countered for Vancouver seven minutes later. Ottawa held off the Millionaires with a strong defensive third period to win the game and take the series lead.\nGame four was played under eastern rules. The first period was scoreless. Skinner put Vancouver ahead early in the second but Boucher tied it up for Ottawa and the teams entered the third period tied 1–1. In the third, Skinner scored again and Cook scored to put Vancouver up by two goals. Broadbent scored for Ottawa a minute later. Vancouver held off the Senators to win the game and tie the series.\nIn the fifth and deciding game, it was estimated that 12,000 attended and 3,000 were turned away. Skinner scored to put Vancouver up 1–0 after the first period. Darragh scored twice for Ottawa in the second period to put the Senators ahead with one period to play. With two minutes to play, Cook was body-checked by Eddie Gerard and retaliated. Cleghorn then decked Cook with a punch to the jaw and a free-for-all broke out, only ended by the police going onto the ice. The three were penalized and Ottawa finished the game with five players, while Vancouver finished with six. Ottawa held on to win the game 2–1 and the series and retained the championship. After the game, the teams exchanged sweaters and much of the Ottawas' equipment was taken away by souvenir hunters.\nDarragh led the Senators in scoring with five goals during the series, while goaltender Clint Benedict only allowed just 12 goals in the five games, earning a 2.40 goals-against average. Since all games were played in Vancouver, the three wins by the Senators meant they were the first team to win three road games in a Final series. Darragh had had to get special permission from his job with Ottawa Dairy Company, at the request of Ottawa mayor Frank Plant, to play in the final. Alf Skinner led the scoring for Vancouver with four goals. It was the final Stanley Cup series for Cyclone Taylor. \nVancouver coach Frank Patrick remarked after the series: \"You have the greatest team I have ever saw. Ottawa ought to be proud of those boys. Their defensive system is marvellous. They are better than the 'Little Men of Iron', the 'Silver Seven' or any other sextet I have ever watched. It was no disgrace to lose to that aggregation.\"\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1921 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Senators never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season.\nIt was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1921 Ottawa Senators\" was put onto its then-new collar.\nThe following Senators players and staff were members of the Stanley Cup winning team.\n1920–21 Ottawa Senators"

        "title": "James Hook (rugby union)",
        "text": "James William Hook (born 27 June 1985) is a retired Welsh rugby union player. Hook has won 81 caps for Wales (currently 13th all-time) and is Wales' fifth highest all-time points scorer. Most often playing as a fly-half, Hook is known as a utility player, and has also played as a centre, wing and fullback.\nHook began his club career with Neath, from 2004 to 2006. He then played for the Ospreys (2006–2011), Perpignan (2011–2014) and Gloucester (2014–2016), before returning to the Ospreys in 2016.\nHook toured South Africa in 2009 with the British &amp; Irish Lions, making six appearances. He was named on the bench for the third test, but did not play in the game.\nEarly and personal life.\nHook was born in the South Wales industrial town of Port Talbot, the second of three children. His brother Mike Hook was also a professional rugby player, and sister Naidine a keen netball player. He attended Glan Afan Comprehensive School in the centre of Port Talbot, and Neath College where he started a half back combination with Martin Roberts.\nHook's childhood heroes were Neil Jenkins and Robert Jones – Jenkins because of his kicking ability, and Jones because he played in Hook's favourite position, which was scrum-half, the position he himself played for West Wales at the age of ten.\nIn June 2011, Hook married long-term partner Kimberley. In 2004 Kimberley was in the U17 Welsh Netball Squad. The couple have a son, born on 23 December 2009. In 2014, Hook announced that Kimberley was pregnant with their second child.\nCareer.\nClub.\nHook grew up playing schoolboy rugby with the junior and youth set-ups at various Port Talbot-based clubs including Aberavon Quins RFC, Taibach RFC and Corus (Port Talbot) RFC.\nAt senior level and before making the step up to regional rugby with the Ospreys, Hook enjoyed great success for Neath RFC, becoming the record holder for the highest individual points tally within a season. He also played for Neath College as a youngster.\nHook played his way into the Ospreys first XV in the 2006–07 Magners League season, giving outstanding performances at both fly-half and inside centre. He kicked a conversion in a Pool 3 match against the Sale Sharks during the 2006-07 Heineken Cup, clinching the Ospreys win following a try from Shane Williams.\nIn November 2010 it was announced that Hook would not be signing a new contract with the Ospreys. On 26 January 2011 James announced that he would be joining French Top 14 side USA Perpignan on a 3-year deal for the 2011–12 season despite warnings from Wales' national coach Warren Gatland that he may not consider players based outside Wales in his future squads.\nOn 2 June 2014, Hook was granted early release from USA Perpignan, following their relegation from the Top 14, to join Gloucester Rugby in the English Aviva Premiership on a three-year contract.\nOn 30 November 2016, Hook rejoined home region Ospreys in Wales on a three-year deal ahead of the 2017–18 season.\nInternational.\nAfter excelling at under-21 level for Wales, Hook starred for the Welsh sevens team, scoring a match-winning try to defeat South Africa Sevens in the plate final of the 2006 Commonwealth Games. Hook made his international debut against Argentina under new Welsh coach Gareth Jenkins, scoring a late try in the match.\nHook made his home debut for Wales against Australia on 4 November 2006 as a substitute for the injured Stephen Jones. He showed great composure in scoring 13 points as Wales drew the match 29–29 and was named as Wales' Man of the Match. Hook played against the Pacific Islands, scoring a try, and against Canada where he scored 16 points.\nDuring the 2007 Six Nations Championship, Hook played in all of Wales's games, but was hampered by being employed at inside centre, rather than in his preferred position of fly-half for the first four matches. As a result, he struggled to make an impact. In the final game against England, however, he was finally switched to fly-half and produced a Man of the Match-winning performance, scoring 22 points in Wales' 27–18 win. He also completed his first \"full house\" in this match (scoring a drop goal, penalty, try and conversion). The victory was Wales' first over a 'Tier One' rugby nation since the 2006 Six Nations Championship victory over Scotland.\nHook put in a man-of-the-match performance as he helped Wales beat England 26–19 in the first game of the 2008 Six Nations Championship on 2 February 2008.\nOn 10 February 2008, Hook was selected at fly-half for the 30–15 win over Scotland in the 2008 Six Nations Championship. Hook scored a try and kicked two conversions and a penalty, before being replaced by Stephen Jones in the 58th minute. He was a member of the Wales side that completed the Grand Slam with victory against France.\nIn May 2009, Hook was included in the 2009 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. He was called into the squad as a utility back to cover his Wales teammate, Leigh Halfpenny, who was forced to withdraw from the beginning of the tour with a thigh injury. He made his British &amp; Irish Lions debut on 3 June, playing against the Lions Super Rugby team. Hook came off the bench in that game to score one try and kick 3 conversions. He did not however play in a test match on the tour.\nIn 2010, Hook was selected to the Wales 2010 Six Nations Championship team, playing for the first time at outside centre.\nIn January 2011 Hook confirmed he would join French side Perpignan on a three-year contract from the start of the 2011–12 season. His contract guaranteed availability for all of Wales's 2011 Rugby World Cup preparatory games. However, there is no clause covering future release outside of the normal International Rugby Board window.\nPost rugby career.\nOn 13 January 2020, Hook announced his retirement from the game, to take place at the end of the 2019–20 season upon expiration of his contract with the Ospreys. He mentioned wanting to remain involved in rugby by coaching, with focus on skills, but also with his first children-stories book in the release process.\nOn 11 August 2020, Hook stays with his team Ospreys as their new Kicking and Skills coach.\nIn 2021, Hook took part in S4C's Welsh language learning programme , being paired with referee Nigel Owens as his mentor."

Each of the four matches played at Louis Armstrong Stadium, the tournament's Center Court at the time, went the maximum number of sets. All eight players would win at least one Grand Slam title, seven were eventually inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame. From the opening serve of the first contest at 11:07 am (ET) to match point of the final one at 11:16 pm, there were 16 sets, 165 games and 979 points.\nThe day opened with an over-35 men's singles semifinal match won by Stan Smith over John Newcombe. In the first of two men's singles semifinal contests, Ivan Lendl advanced to his third consecutive US Open final after outlasting Pat Cash 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 6–7 (5–7), 7–6 (7–4). The last two matches involved rivalries. Martina Navratilova captured the second of her four US Open women's singles championships by defeating Chris Evert 4–6, 6–4, 6–4. The other men's singles semifinal between John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors didn't begin until 7:28 pm. McEnroe survived a nighttime thriller 6–4, 4–6, 7–5, 4–6, 6–3, en route to what would be the last singles Grand Slam title of his career (subsequently adding to his men's doubles titles at the US Open in 1989 and Wimbledon in 1992).\nThe lengthy day at Center Court was made possible by CBS which was televising the tournament. Not wanting a recurrence of what happened the previous year when three quick contests forced a scramble to fill the remaining allocated time, the network had requested the addition of the Smith-Newcombe match to lead off the program. The broadcast established what was then the longest continuous coverage of a sporting event in American television history.\nTennis fans who were present at Armstrong Stadium to enjoy all the contests that day were able to do so on a single admission. When both Serena and Venus Williams made the tournament finals together for the first time in 2001, organizers switched the women's singles championship match to prime time to attract more television viewers. In the process, they also began charging separate admission for each of the two sessions on the last Saturday of the fortnight.\nExternal links.\n "

The switch came after player complaints about the poor state and uneven ball bounce on the grass courts in Forest Hills. The tie-break scoring system changed in this championship. Previously a sudden death point was played at 4–4 with the winner the first to 5 points.

        "title": "Royal Rumble (1993)",
        "text": "The 1993 Royal Rumble was the sixth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 24, 1993, at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one dark match. The main event was the 1993 Royal Rumble match. It was won by Yokozuna, who was awarded a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania IX. This was the first time that the Rumble winner earned a world championship match at WrestleMania, which is now standard for the annual event. In other prominent matches, Bret Hart defeated Razor Ramon to retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and Shawn Michaels defeated Marty Jannetty to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV). It has been produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988, and has been broadcast on PPV since 1989. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, later dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 1993 event was the sixth event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 24, 1993, at the ARCO Arena in Sacramento, California.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Prior to 1992, there was no prize for winning the match. At the 1992 event, as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship had been vacated, it was decided that the prize for the 1992 Royal Rumble match would be the vacant title. For the 1993 match, it was decided that the winner would receive a match for the championship at WrestleMania IX.\nStorylines.\nThe primary feud leading up to Royal Rumble 1993 was between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Bret Hart and challenger Razor Ramon (a replacement for The Ultimate Warrior, who had left the previous November). Ramon formed an alliance in late 1992 with Ric Flair, who Hart defeated to win the title belt. During an interview in which Hart was talking about the upcoming match, Ramon and Flair came to the ring and attacked Hart. Ramon later escalated the feud by attacking Owen Hart, Bret's brother.\nAnother major feud featured at the event was between Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, who had teamed for several years as The Rockers. The team split up in December 1991, when Michaels attacked Jannetty during an episode of Brutus Beefcake's interview segment, \"The Barber Shop\". Michaels became a singles wrestler and won the WWF Intercontinental Championship on October 27, 1992, from Davey Boy Smith. On the October 31, 1992, episode of \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", Jannetty returned to the WWF after a lengthy absence and confronted Michaels. He attempted to hit Michaels with a mirror, but Michaels pulled his valet, Sensational Sherri in front of him. Sherri was hit with the mirror, which caused friction between her and Michaels. Michaels and Jannetty were scheduled to face each other for the Intercontinental Championship at Royal Rumble 1993. Leading up to the match, Sherri announced that she would be in the corner of one of the men, but she refused to say which one.\nIn an undercard match, The Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner), who made their WWF debut in late 1992, were scheduled to face the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly). There was little buildup for the match, but the Steiners and Beverlys had a rivalry over which was the best team of brothers in the WWF (although the Beverly Brothers are not related in real life).\nSeveral feuds also formed the background for the Royal Rumble match. Virgil had served as Ted DiBiase's servant and bodyguard for several years. DiBiase treated Virgil poorly, which eventually led Virgil to turn against his employer. At Royal Rumble 1991, he attacked DiBiase after a match by hitting him with the Million Dollar Championship, a title that DiBiase had awarded himself. Virgil defeated DiBiase for the belt at SummerSlam 1991, although DiBiase later regained the title. The Undertaker was feuding with manager Harvey Wippleman. He had a series of matches against Kamala in 1992 that included a bout at SummerSlam. The rivalry culminated in a coffin match at Survivor Series 1992. The Undertaker won the match, but Wippleman vowed revenge. Tito Santana and Rick Martel had formed a tag team known as Strike Force in 1987, and they held the World Tag Team Championship together for five months. Martel walked away during a match against the Brain Busters at WrestleMania V, leaving Santana to face both opponents alone. The team split up as a result and the former partners had a lengthy feud.\nMr. Perfect served as \"executive consultant\" to Ric Flair in 1992, but the relationship broke down toward the end of the year. The partnership split up when Perfect teamed with Randy Savage to face Flair and Razor Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. Flair legitimately requested a release from his contract, as he felt he would be more successful if he returned to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). WWF owner Vince McMahon agreed and set up a feud between Flair and Perfect to create a storyline for Flair's departure from the company. Many wrestlers were scheduled to compete at the 1993 Royal Rumble but were either replaced or had left the company before the event. Those who were scheduled to compete were Doink the Clown, Crush, Hacksaw Jim Duggan, The Mountie, and Kamala.\nThe event also featured the WWF debut of Lex Luger. Luger had previously wrestled in WCW, where he held the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. He had left the wrestling industry to join Vince McMahon's World Bodybuilding Federation (WBF). After the WBF failed, Luger signed with McMahon's WWF.\nEvent.\nFive matches with pre-determined results were shown on the pay-per-view telecast. In addition, Doink the Clown defeated Jim Powers by submission in an untelevised dark match before the event. In the first match shown as part of the broadcast, the Steiner Brothers (Rick Steiner and Scott Steiner) faced the Beverly Brothers (Beau Beverly and Blake Beverly). Scott gained the early advantage over Beau, both men quickly tagged in their partners. Rick performed a body slam on Blake and then tagged Scott back in, who threw Blake with a belly to belly suplex. The Beverlys regained the advantage and took turns attacking Scott's back. Blake performed a Boston crab hold to put more pressure on Scott's back and attempt to force him to submit. Scott escaped the hold and threw Blake to the mat by performing a Tiger driver. The Steiners capitalized on their advantage by keeping Blake in the ring and unable to tag his partner. Scott won the match for his team by pinning Blake after executing a Frankensteiner.\nIn the next match, Sensational Sherri stood at ringside as Shawn Michaels defended his Intercontinental Championship against Marty Jannetty. She did not reveal her allegiance to either man. Jannetty gained the early advantage, knocking Michaels out of the ring and diving onto him through the ropes. He then attacked Michaels by jumping off the top rope, but Michaels countering this move by hitting him on the way down. Michaels hit Jannetty's shoulder against the ring post and focused on wearing down the shoulder once both men had re-entered the ring. Michaels missed an attack from the top rope, which allowed Jannetty to punch him repeatedly. Michaels recovered and threw Jannetty out of the ring, but Jannetty then suplexed Michaels over the rope and onto the arena floor. Sherri turned on Michaels by slapping him in the face, and Jannetty threw Michaels back into the ring with a belly-to-back suplex. Jannetty performed a powerslam and a DDT on Michaels. Michaels attempted to punch Jannetty but knocked the referee unconscious instead. Sherri came into the ring and tried to hit Michaels with her shoe. Michaels moved out of the way, and Sherri hit Jannetty instead. When the referee recovered, Michaels performed a superkick on Jannetty and pinned him to retain the championship.\nThe third televised match featured the Big Boss Man facing Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow attacked Boss Man before the match and controlled the match's beginning by using power moves to wear Boss Man down. Boss Man performed two clotheslines on Bigelow to gain the advantage. Bigelow responded by throwing Boss Man with a belly to back suplex, and then threw him out of the ring. He wore Boss Man down with a bear hug. Boss Man briefly regained the advantage by suplexing Bigelow but eventually tried to run at Bigelow to crush him in the corner of the ring. As Boss Man approached, Bigelow kicked him in the face and followed this up by performing a diving headbutt from the top rope to win the match by pinfall.\nThe next match was for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, as Bret Hart defended the title against Razor Ramon. Ramon got the early advantage by punching Hart repeatedly but accidentally hit his knee against a turnbuckle while running at Hart. Hart applied a figure-four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's knee. Ramon escaped the hold and threw Hart against a ring post; he capitalized on this advantage by attacking Hart's back. Ramon threw Hart with a fallaway slam and applied a bear hug. Hart escaped the hold by biting Ramon. He threw Ramon out of the ring and performed several of his signature moves, including a Russian legsweep and an elbow drop from the second rope. Hart applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, but Ramon grabbed the ropes, which forced the referee to instruct Hart to break the hold. Hart threw Ramon with a belly-to-back suplex, but Ramon responded by attempting to perform the Razor's Edge, his signature move. Hart reversed this into an unsuccessful pin attempt. With both men exhausted, Hart applied the Sharpshooter and won the match by forcing Ramon to submit.\nBefore the final match, Bobby Heenan, a manager and commentator, unveiled his newest wrestler, \"The Narcissist\" Lex Luger. Heenan pointed out Luger's muscles and announced that Luger would carry on Heenan's rivalry with Mr. Perfect.\nThe main event of the broadcast, the Royal Rumble match, came next. For the first time, a stipulation was added that the winner of the match would receive a match for the WWF Championship at that year's WrestleMania (a provision that has remained since). The match began with two former WWF Champions, as Ric Flair and Bob Backlund entered the ring first. Every two minutes, one of the remaining twenty-eight contestants entered the match according to the number they drew prior to the event. Papa Shango was the third wrestler to enter but was thrown over the top rope and onto the arena floor by Ric Flair, causing Shango to be eliminated. Virgil entered sixth and immediately attacked Ted DiBiase because of their long-standing grudge. When Mr. Perfect entered in the number ten spot, he and Flair fought each other until Perfect eliminated Flair by performing a clothesline to knock Flair onto the floor. Virgil was eliminated by The Berzerker, while Perfect was thrown out of the ring by Jerry Lawler, Koko B. Ware, and Ted DiBiase.\nThe Undertaker was the fifteenth wrestler to enter; he eliminated four men before Harvey Wippleman appeared, accompanying a large man (who was later revealed to be Giant González, billed at eight feet tall). González attacked The Undertaker and threw him out of the ring; as a result, The Undertaker was eliminated from the match. Several referees tried to get González to return to the locker room; he eventually left, and Paul Bearer, The Undertaker's manager, came to the ring. He helped The Undertaker revive, and The Undertaker returned to the locker room to find González. Several minutes later, Typhoon entered the match, followed shortly by his tag team partner in The Natural Disasters, Earthquake. Earthquake immediately targeted Typhoon and eliminated him from the match. Earthquake tried to console his partner, who ignored him and left ringside. Later, Tito Santana and Rick Martel were in the ring at the same time; they fought each other immediately as a result of their five-year-old feud. Yokozuna, weighing over 500 pounds (227 kilograms), entered in the number twenty-seven spot; at one point, almost every wrestler worked together in an attempt to eliminate him, but they were unable to lift him.\nFormer WWF Champion Randy Savage was the last wrestler to enter the match. The wrestlers fought and several men were eliminated in quick succession, leaving Backlund, Martel, Yokozuna, and Savage. Backlund eliminated Martel but was then eliminated by Yokozuna. Backlund was in the ring for one hour, one minute, and ten seconds, which set a new record for time spent in a Royal Rumble match. Savage gained the advantage over Yokozuna; he knocked him down and performed a diving elbow drop from the top rope. He tried to pin Yokozuna, although pinfalls are not counted during a Royal Rumble. Yokozuna pushed Savage off of him so hard that Savage flew over the top rope and onto the arena floor. As a result, Yokozuna was named the winner of the 1993 Royal Rumble match.\nReception.\nWriting for \"Online Onslaught\", columnist Adam Gutschmidt stated that the first half of the event is worth watching. He enjoyed the tag team match and the bout between Jannetty and Michaels. He also found the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match surprisingly good. He did not feel that the match between Big Boss Man and Bam Bam Bigelow was interesting. He also disliked the Royal Rumble match because too many tag team wrestlers were included, there were few exciting moments, and Giant González did not help the match. Scott Keith reviewed the event for \"411mania\". He found the opening match between the Steiners and Beverlys to be boring. He enjoyed much of the match between Jannetty and Michaels but found the ending disappointing. He rated the match between Boss Man and Bigelow as a \"dud\" but enjoyed the WWF World Heavyweight Championship bout. He called the Royal Rumble match one of the worst in history, as he found much of the match boring and did not enjoy the debut of González. Overall, he rated the event as \"mildly recommended\".\nThe event drew 16,000 spectators, who paid $187,000 in admission fees. This was down from the previous year's 17,000 fans but higher than the attendance for any of the following three Royal Rumble events. The pay-per-view buyrate of 1.25 was also lower than that of Royal Rumble 1992, which had a 1.8 buyrate. It was higher than the buyrates for all of the Royal Rumble events from 1994 to 1998.\nRoyal Rumble 1993 was released on VHS by Coliseum Video on February 11, 1993, in North America. It was released on DVD in North America as part of WWE's Complete Royal Rumble Anthology on November 27, 2007. In the United Kingdom, it was released on VHS in 1993. On June 6, 2005, it was packaged together with Royal Rumble 1994 as part of WWE's Tagged Classics line for its United Kingdom DVD release. This was followed by the Complete Royal Rumble Anthology DVD set, which was released on October 15, 2007.\nAftermath.\nAt WrestleMania IX, Yokozuna defeated Bret Hart to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. His title reign only lasted several minutes, as he dropped the belt to Hulk Hogan in an impromptu match. Yokozuna regained the title but dropped it to Hart the following year. The 1993 Royal Rumble in turn began a tradition, in which the winner of the titular match now earns a world championship match at WrestleMania.\nShawn Michaels continued his feud with Sensational Sherri at WrestleMania IX. Sherri accompanied Tatanka, and Michaels countered this by introducing Luna Vachon, his new valet. After the match, Vachon attacked Sherri. The feud also continued between Michaels and Jannetty, as Jannetty defeated Michaels for the Intercontinental Championship on May 17, 1993. Michaels regained the belt in a rematch the following month to end the feud.\nRazor Ramon continued to wrestle in high-profile matches but achieved little success until changing his persona to a face after losing to the underdog 1-2-3 Kid in May 1993. As a fan favorite, Ramon won his first of four Intercontinental Championships in September 1993.\nThe day after Royal Rumble on Monday Night Raw, Flair faced Perfect in a loser leaves town match, in which the loser would be forced to leave the WWF forever. Because Flair had an agreement with McMahon to lose to Mr. Perfect before leaving the promotion, Perfect won the match and Flair did not appear in the WWF again until 2001 on the episode of Raw that was the day after Survivor Series when he appeared as a co-owner of the promotion. With Flair gone from the promotion, Luger continued Heenan's feud and defeated Mr. Perfect at WrestleMania IX.\nThe Beverly Brothers were unable to win the World Tag Team Championship, but the Steiners won the belts on two occasions in 1993. They feuded with Money Inc. (DiBiase and Irwin R. Schyster), who had held the belts since the previous October, before winning their first championship on June 14.\nEarthquake and Typhoon stopped teaming after their confrontation during the Royal Rumble match. No feud ever materialized, as Earthquake was released by the WWF and left to compete in Japan. The rivalry between Virgil and DiBiase was not mentioned again until the following year, when Virgil had a brief feud with Nikolai Volkoff, who was managed by DiBiase. DiBiase was reunited with Virgil, who had been renamed Vincent, when both men were members of WCW's New World Order in 1996.\nLuger's status as a heel (villain) was short-lived. Yokozuna issued a challenge for any American athlete to try to bodyslam him on the deck of the on Independence Day that year. Several athletes made the attempt, but nobody was able to lift Yokozuna until Luger arrived in a helicopter and bodyslammed Yokozuna. Luger received a push and was given a match for Yokozuna's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam 1993, but he was unable to win the belt.\nThe Undertaker's feud with Harvey Wippleman escalated in the following months and was featured at two more pay-per-view events in 1993. The Undertaker faced Giant González at WrestleMania IX; González was disqualified after attacking The Undertaker with a chloroform-soaked rag provided by Wippleman. Wippleman and González recruited Mr. Hughes, and the three men attacked The Undertaker and Paul Bearer. They stole The Undertaker's urn, which was said to be the source of his power. The feud culminated in a Rest in Peace match at SummerSlam 1993, which The Undertaker won to end the feud.\nResults.\n Sensational Sherri was in a neutral corner in the third match.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every two minutes."

        "text": "The 1992 Royal Rumble was the fifth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 19, 1992, at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one dark match. The main event was the 1992 Royal Rumble match. This Royal Rumble match was notable as for the first time, the winner would win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which had been vacated in December 1991. Ric Flair would start at number 3, Sid Justice would enter at number 29 while The Undertaker and Hulk Hogan would enter at numbers 20 and 26 respectively. In other featured matches on the undercard, The Natural Disasters (Earthquake and Typhoon) had a WWF Tag Team Championship match against current champions The Legion of Doom (Hawk and Animal), The Beverly Brothers (Blake Beverly and Beau Beverly) took on in a tag team match The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Luke and Bushwhacker Butch), and Roddy Piper took on current WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Mountie with the title on the line.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 1992 event was the fifth event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 19, 1992, at the Knickerbocker Arena in Albany, New York.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Prior to 1992, there was no prize for winning the match. However, as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship had been vacated, the vacant title became the prize of the 1992 Royal Rumble match. It was the first of only two times in which the promotion's world championship was the prize of the Royal Rumble match—the second occurred at the 2016 event.\nStorylines.\nPrior to the event, it was announced the winner of the Royal Rumble would win the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which had been stripped from Hulk Hogan after two controversial title switches between Hogan and the Undertaker, first at the 1991 Survivor Series and later at the Tuesday in Texas pay-per-view event. Hogan and The Undertaker were among the 30 entrants in the event. WWF president Jack Tunney gave Hogan and Undertaker an advantage in the random draw to determine the order in which wrestlers would enter the ring, promising them numbers between 20 and 30.\nEvent.\nThe event comprised five matches, including the Royal Rumble match. The Royal Rumble match helped begin Justice's slow-building turn into a villain. Justice – who was returning from a recent injury – entered at No. 29 and was among the final four wrestlers, along with Hogan, Randy Savage, although he jumped outside the ring to hit Jake the Snake Roberts and Flair. Justice eliminated Savage and then Hogan, leaving himself and Flair in the ring. During the initial live pay-per-view broadcast, Justice's elimination of Hogan was loudly cheered by the audience in attendance even though, as per storyline plans, Sid \"sneaked up from behind\" to throw Hogan out. As such, the original reaction was edited out of future television replays of the event, with play-by-play announcer Gorilla Monsoon adding new comments condemning Sid for his actions (Monsoon had originally said Justice's elimination of Hogan was fair). Hogan, who was still at ringside after being eliminated, grabbed Sid's arm and distracted him long enough for Flair to eliminate him to win the match and become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. After the match, Sid and Hogan got into an argument in the ring and had to be separated by security.\nIn his book, \"To Be The Man\", Ric Flair mentions not knowing he was going to be winning the Royal Rumble (WWF Title) until arriving at the arena the day of the event, and also felt he was brought in at number three in order to showcase his skills and endurance to the WWF audience, who may not have watched his work in Jim Crockett Promotions and World Championship Wrestling. Bobby Heenan mentioned in his autobiography, \"Bobby The Brain\", that it was his initial suggestion that Flair enter the Rumble at number one for dramatic purposes, and that Vince McMahon changed it to number three and claimed it as his own idea.\nReception.\nThe Rumble match is often considered the greatest Rumble in history. In particular, the commentary by Heenan was particularly praised, with some calling it \"one of the greatest color commentary performances in pay-per-view history\".\nAftermath.\nThe confrontation between Hogan and Justice was played out over a series of future WWF television programs. On the \"Superstars\" program aired January 25, 1992, WWF President Jack Tunney held a press conference, where he announced that Hogan would face Flair for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania VIII. Justice, who was also in attendance and began standing up as if Tunney were about to proclaim him the top contender, was outraged and termed the announcement \"the most bogus act Jack Tunney has ever pulled off.\" Sid later apologized and Hogan accepted, but on the February 8 \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXX\", Justice abandoned Hogan during a tag-team match against Flair and The Undertaker, completing his heel turn and leading to a match at WrestleMania VIII.\nFlair, meanwhile, began feuding with Savage over the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. According to the storyline, Flair claimed that he had a previous relationship with Savage's wife, Miss Elizabeth, going as far as presenting pictures of Elizabeth in which Flair had himself superimposed. This culminated in a title match at WrestleMania VIII; Savage won the match and his second (and final) WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\nThis was the first Royal Rumble in which stakes were involved for the winner—the stipulation in which the winner would face the WWF/WWE World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania first took place at the following year's event. It would be 24 years before the Royal Rumble was again for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.\nRandy Savage eliminated himself shortly after eliminating Jake Roberts by jumping to Roberts over the top rope. However, he returned to the ring and resumed his participation.\nRic Flair broke the longevity record for lasting 1:00:02. This record would stand for one year before it would be broken by Bob Backlund (Lasting 1:01:10) in Royal Rumble (1993). Ric Flair also became the first person in history to last more than one hour."

        "text": "The 1991 Royal Rumble was the fourth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 19, 1991, at the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nSeven matches were contested at the event, including one dark match. The main event was the 1991 Royal Rumble match, which was won by Hulk Hogan, who last eliminated Earthquake, making Hogan the first multi-time Royal Rumble winner. In other featured matches on the undercard, Sgt. Slaughter defeated The Ultimate Warrior to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, Ted DiBiase and Virgil defeated Dusty Rhodes and Dustin Rhodes, The Mountie defeated Koko B. Ware, and The Rockers (Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels) defeated The Orient Express (Kato and Tanaka).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers. The 1991 event was the fourth event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 19, 1991, at the Miami Arena in Miami, Florida.\nStorylines.\nThe card consisted of seven matches. The matches resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, with storylines produced on their weekly television shows, \"Superstars\", \"Wrestling Challenge\", and \"Prime Time Wrestling\".\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble was between the WWF World Heavyweight Champion The Ultimate Warrior, who had been champion since defeating Hulk Hogan at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990, and Sgt. Slaughter, who had returned to the WWF in 1990 and became a villainous (heel) sympathizer of the Iraqi government. Their feud began building during a time when the United States was engaged in Operation Desert Shield (which became Operation Desert Storm on January 17, two days before the Royal Rumble). During the build-up to their match, Slaughter and his manager, General Adnan, cut several anti-American promos to build heat for the event; at one point, Slaughter unwrapped a present and revealed a pair of boots purportedly sent to him by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. In the meantime, \"Macho King\" Randy Savage challenged Warrior to his own series of matches, which Warrior successfully answered.\nEvent.\nMain event matches.\nThe tag team match pitting Ted DiBiase and Virgil against Dusty Rhodes and Rhodes' son, Dustin Rhodes was most notable for Virgil's split from DiBiase. Tensions that had been building between the two in the previous weeks exploded when – after the match – Virgil struck DiBiase in the head with his Million Dollar Championship to turn into a face. DiBiase had verbally abused Virgil throughout the match, and at one point attacked him and threw him from the ring after he was being dominated by the Rhodes' team. DiBiase went on to pin Dusty Rhodes with a roll-up. After the match, DiBiase demanded Virgil bring the Million Dollar Championship into the ring and strap it around his waist. Once he got in the ring, Virgil would drop the belt at DiBiase's feet, to which DiBiase ordered Virgil to pick it up. As DiBiase gloated and then turned back around, Virgil hit him in the face with the championship.\nPrior to the Warrior-Slaughter match at the Royal Rumble, Queen Sherri (Savage's valet) attempted to seduce Warrior into granting Savage a title shot. Warrior refused, enraging Savage. During the match itself, Warrior easily fought off a double-team attack by Adnan and Slaughter, running Adnan off before shredding the Iraqi flag and stuffing it into Slaughter's mouth. As Warrior was attempting to finish off Slaughter, Sherri interfered by grabbing Warrior's leg; Warrior chased Sherri down the aisle before he was attacked by Savage near the platform area. Savage struck Warrior with a spotlight as Slaughter regained his senses and distracted the referee. After several minutes of Slaughter holding the advantage, Warrior rallied and set up Slaughter for the gorilla press slam (Warrior's finishing move). However, Warrior grabbed Sherri (who had returned to ringside) and press slammed her onto Savage, who had also appeared at ringside. This gave Slaughter time to hit a knee strike to Warrior's back. Warrior fell into the ropes, where Savage shattered his royal scepter on Warrior's head while the referee was distracted. Slaughter then hit the unconscious Warrior with an elbow drop and pinned him to win the match and championship. After Warrior came to his senses, he ran backstage to find Savage.\nThe Royal Rumble marked the continuation of an ongoing feud between Hulk Hogan and Earthquake, whose roots dated to mid-1990 when Earthquake injured Hogan in a sneak attack during \"The Brother Love Show\". Hogan and Earthquake were the final two competitors in the Royal Rumble, and Hogan eliminated Earthquake to win the Royal Rumble.\nThe pay-per-view broadcast also included featured pre-taped comments from fans outside the arena, wishing United States troops a quick and safe return from the Middle East, and an announcement that Hogan would tour military bases across the country to support the troops.\nReception.\nIn the January 28, 1991 issue of his Wrestling Observer Newsletter, Dave Meltzer referred to the match between The Rockers and The Orient Express as the best WWF pay-per-view match since the WrestleMania III match between Ricky Steamboat and Randy Savage. Meltzer also wrote that he considered it the best WWF pay-per-view to that point in time.\nA fan vote in the February 11, 1991 issue of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter had 268 out of 328 fans give the show a thumbs up. 41 gave a thumbs down, while 19 gave a thumbs in the middle. The Rockers vs. The Orient Express received the majority of votes for the show's best match, with 157. Koko B. Ware vs. The Mountie received the most votes for the worst match of the night with 98.\nAftermath.\nFollowing his WWF World Heavyweight Championship loss, Warrior focused on revenge against Savage, with their first encounter being a steel cage match on January 21 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which Savage won (with help from Sensational Sherri); Warrior was enraged and – despite being restrained by several referees and other wrestlers – attacked Sherri after the match by slamming her in the ring. Meanwhile, Warrior was unsuccessful in regaining the title, losing a series of steel cage matches to Slaughter, usually due to interference from Sensational Sherri. Warrior and Savage eventually agreed to a \"career vs. career match\" at WrestleMania VII, which Warrior won. (Slaughter, meanwhile, also defended his belt against \"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan, with Duggan winning a majority of these matches by countout or disqualification.)\nHogan, meanwhile, was named the number one contender for Slaughter's WWF World Heavyweight Championship. During a promo that took place right after the Slaughter-Warrior match, Gene Okerlund \"received word\" that Slaughter was defacing the American flag, to which Hogan vowed that Slaughter's reign as World Heavyweight Champion would be short-lived. At WrestleMania VII, Hogan defeated Slaughter to become WWF World Heavyweight Champion for the third time. (Prior to WrestleMania VII, Hogan defeated Earthquake in a series of \"stretcher matches\" to finish their feud.) Though Hogan received a title shot against Sgt. Slaughter in WrestleMania, it would not be until 1993 that the Royal Rumble match winner automatically received a WWF World Title shot at the following WrestleMania.\nThe Barbarian would begin teaming with Haku for tag team matches, but were both mired in the midcard. Barbarian would leave WWF in mid-1992 and return to WCW.\nDusty and Dustin Rhodes left the WWF after their match, both returning to WCW, Dusty retired from active wrestling and became a booker and commentator, and Dustin returned to wrestling as \"The Natural\" and feuding with Larry Zbyszko and later Terry Taylor. Four years later Dustin would return to the WWF as the androgynous wrestler \"Goldust\".\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes."

It took place on January 21, 1990, at the Orlando Arena in Orlando, Florida. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including one dark match. The main event was the 1990 Royal Rumble match, which was won by WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan, who last eliminated Mr. Perfect. The undercard matches saw Jim Duggan defeat Big Boss Man by disqualification, Ronnie Garvin defeat Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine in a Submission match, and The Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Butch and Bushwhacker Luke) defeat The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau).\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV), produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988.

It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The previous year's event established the tradition of the match generally featuring 30 wrestlers. The 1990 event was the third event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 21, 1990, at the Orlando Arena in Orlando, Florida.\nStorylines.\nThe Bushwhackers (Bushwhacker Butch and Bushwhacker Luke) made their WWF debut in Madison Square Garden on December 30, 1988, defeating The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff and Boris Zhukov). They got involved in a feud with The Bolsheviks, which was to be settled at WrestleMania V. Bolsheviks missed the event, however, so they were replaced by The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau), whom Bushwhackers beat. Bushwhackers and Rougeaus continued to feud with each other for the rest of the year, culminating in a tag team match at Royal Rumble 1990.\nGreg Valentine and Ronnie Garvin had been feuding since a match on December 30, 1988, in Madison Square Garden (MSG) which Valentine won by grabbing the tights for leverage. On the April 22, 1989 episode of \"Superstars\", Garvin defeated Valentine in a match. On the following edition of \"Superstars\", they both faced each other in a retirement match where the loser could not wrestle anymore in WWF. Valentine won the match, sending Garvin into retirement. In retirement, Garvin took up other positions in the WWF; first he became a referee but he was suspended after disqualifying Valentine in a match against Jimmy Snuka, and later a ring announcer at SummerSlam 1989, a position he used to berate and belittle his erstwhile rival. Valentine was so irate that he demanded for Garvin to be re-instated as a professional wrestler and his request was accepted. At Survivor Series, they both battled in a match on opposing teams.\nOther wrestlers in World Wrestling Federation – including WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and the other champions – were prepared to participate in the 1990 Royal Rumble match. Many tag team wrestlers, mid-card wrestlers and main event wrestlers were allotted their entry numbers to participate in this match. Prior to the match, it was mentioned that WWF President Jack Tunney had allotted \"extra security\" to the drawing process. Ted Dibiase, who had cheated to obtain a late number in the previous year's event, eventually revealed to Gene Okerlund that he had drawn #1. By contrast, Mr. Perfect revealed that he had obtained the \"perfect draw\" - #30.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view (PPV), Paul Roma defeated The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match.

He got his scissors and tried to cut Genius' hair with it, until Mr. Perfect came out and hit Beefcake with a Perfectplex. The referee got up and disqualified both Beefcake and Genius. Perfect brought a chair into the ring and nailed Beefcake in the ribs with it.\nThe third match was a Submission match between Ronnie Garvin and Greg Valentine.

The Honky Tonk Man entered at #24. Martel eliminated Neidhart with some aid by Warrior and DiBiase as well. Warrior reversed an Irish whip by DiBiase and clotheslined him over the top rope. DiBiase broke Mr. Perfect's longevity record of staying in a Royal Rumble match with 44:47.\nWWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan entered at #25. Immediately after entering, Hogan eliminated Snuka and then Haku. Santana tried to eliminate Martel but Warrior tripped Santana and eliminated him. Honky attacked Hogan but it was for no use as Hogan eliminated Honky. The other half of The Rockers, Shawn Michaels entered at #26. Michaels was immediately eliminated by Warrior, then Warrior threw Martel out. It was now WWF World Heavyweight vs. IC Heavyweight Champion – Hogan vs. Warrior left in the ring. After looking at each other for a little bit, both powerhouses got in each other's faces, then each bounced off the rope and crashed into one another, but nobody moved, then after a criss-cross, Hogan missed a clothesline and they clotheslined each other. The Barbarian entered at #27 and leveled Hogan with a big boot. \"Ravishing\" Rick Rude entered at #28 before the clock went off and went after Warrior. Barbarian and Rude tried to eliminate Hogan, but the Warrior saved Hogan from being eliminated. Then a Hogan clothesline eliminated the Warrior with help from Barbarian and Rude. Warrior then came back into the ring and attacked both Barbarian and Rude before going backstage. Hercules entered at #29 and teamed with Hogan to battle Barbarian and Rude. The last entrant, Mr. Perfect entered and began stomping Hogan.\nThis made Hogan, Rude, Barbarian, Hercules and Perfect, the final five men. Meanwhile, a miscommunication problem occurred between Barbarian and Rude. Hercules took advantage and eliminated Barbarian. This made it the final four – Hogan, Rude, Hercules and Perfect. Hercules was eliminated by Rude, leading to Hogan, Rude and Perfect as the final three. Rude and Perfect double-teamed Hogan. Perfect held Hogan for a Rude forearm but Hogan ducked and Perfect was sent out to the apron. While on the apron Hogan Irish whipped Rude and as Perfect was pulling himself back up he accidentally pulled the ropes down, letting Rude fly down to the floor. After a short argument between Rude and Perfect, Rude goes backstage. This led to the final two – Hogan and Perfect. Hogan grabbed Perfect back in the ring but received a clothesline by Perfect. Perfect hit Hogan with a Perfect-Plex but Hogan \"hulked up\" and threw Perfect into the ring post. Hogan connected with clotheslines and threw Perfect over the turnbuckle and across the ring post to the floor, to win the 1990 Royal Rumble match.\nAftermath.\nSeveral of the Royal Rumble events were used to build interest in WrestleMania VI, the WWF's next big supercard. Gaining the most interest was a confrontation between WWF World Heavyweight Champion Hulk Hogan and WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion the Ultimate Warrior; both men agreed each had something to prove following their encounter, and a match was signed for WrestleMania VI, to be held at the Toronto Skydome. Both wrestlers agreed to a title vs. title match, where one wrestler could walk out with both titles. Prior to then, Hogan focused on his feud with Mr. Perfect, while Ultimate Warrior defended his Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship primarily against Dino Bravo, with Hogan frequently appearing in the Ultimate Warrior-Bravo matches to nullify Earthquake's appearances in Bravo's corner.\nWWF Tag Team Champions the Colossal Connection (André the Giant and Haku) continued to defend their titles, largely against Demolition (Ax and Smash), the team they won the belts from; the Hart Foundation and the Rockers were occasional opponents. During this time, Haku was doing most of the wrestling as André's health was declining and he only entered the ring usually only for the finish. A final rematch was scheduled for WrestleMania VI.\nFollowing the confrontation between Dusty Rhodes and Sapphire, and \"Macho King\" Randy Savage and Sensational Sherri during \"The Brother Love Show\", an inter-gender match between the two was signed. Prior to that, Savage made one final bid for Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship, facing his sometimes friend and more frequent enemy on \"The Main Event\", aired in February; with Buster Douglas as the referee, Hogan gained a pinfall victory in their last WWF match against each other, with Hogan gaining a further parting shot when Douglas slugged Savage following a post-match argument.\n\"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Bad News Brown's encounter in the Royal Rumble match led to a one-on-one match between the two at WrestleMania VI, which resulted in a double count-out. The Royal Rumble was the last pay-per-view event where The Big Boss Man competed as a heel; shortly after the Royal Rumble, Bossman refused to assist \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase in his feud with Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts, fired Slick as his manager and made former rival Hogan his closest ally.\nThis was the last WWF pay-per-view event commentated by Tony Schiavone, as he left the company shortly afterwards. He went on to work for World Championship Wrestling, which became WWF's chief rival during the 1990s, until its demise in 2001, and had a short-lived stint with Total Nonstop Action Wrestling in 2003 before leaving the sport until 2019, when he became an announcer for All Elite Wrestling. Gorilla Monsoon would resume the lead announcing duties at the WWF's following pay-per-view, WrestleMania VI.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.

        "text": "The 1989 Royal Rumble was the second annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). After the inaugural event aired as a television special, the 1989 event aired on pay-per-view (PPV), thus becoming one of the WWF's original four annual PPV events, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which would become recognized as the \"Big Four\". It took place on January 15, 1989, at The Summit in Houston, Texas. It centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time.\nSix matches were contested at the event, including two dark matches. The main event was the 1989 Royal Rumble match, which was won by Big John Studd, who last eliminated Ted DiBiase. Featured matches on the undercard were Jim Duggan and The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) defeating Dino Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau) in a two-out-of-three falls match, Rockin' Robin defeating Judy Martin to retain the WWF Women's Championship, and King Haku defeating Harley Race to retain his King of the Ring crown and cape.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nIn 1988, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) debuted the Royal Rumble match, although a non-televised version had been tested in 1987. The match was a modified battle royal in which the participants entered at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The inaugural match featured 20 wrestlers and the inaugural event was named after the match. A second event was scheduled to be held on January 15, 1989, at The Summit in Houston, Texas, thus establishing the Royal Rumble as an annual January event. The previous year's event had been shown as a television special on the USA Network. The 1989 event was instead aired on pay-per-view (PPV), being the first Royal Rumble to be broadcast on PPV, in turn becoming one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which would be dubbed the \"Big Four\". It was also the first to feature 30 wrestlers in the titular match, which is now the traditional number of participants.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into the Royal Rumble was between the 30 superstars from the entire World Wrestling Federation (WWF) who had selected to participate in the first-ever 30 man Royal Rumble match. Big John Studd returned to WWF in late 1988 and turned babyface after not siding with former manager Bobby Heenan and began a feud with Heenan's client André the Giant. Both men signed to participate in the Royal Rumble match. Mr. Perfect, who joined WWF in the summer of 1988 was pushed as an undefeated heel wrestler, entering his name into the match. Bad News Brown was pushed as an arrogant powerful heel who was an enemy of face and heel wrestlers. As a result, he also entered his name into the match. Many tag team wrestlers also selected to participate in the match and selected their entry numbers. The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and WWF Champion Randy Savage) were involved in a feud with The Twin Towers (Akeem and The Big Boss Man) since November 1988. At Survivor Series, Mega Powers became the survivors for their team in Survivor Series match against Twin Towers. Since then, Mega Powers and Twin Towers had been at odds and both teams signed to participate in the Royal Rumble.\nThe second feud heading into the event featured Jim Duggan against Dino Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). Since joining the WWF in early 1987, Duggan used an American patriot gimmick, coming to the ring with an American flag and feuding with non-American wrestlers in the WWF roster (such as Nikolai Volkoff). In early 1989, Duggan began feuding with the French-Canadians Bravo and the Rougeau brothers battling them with different partners. At a live event on January 6 in Montreal, Duggan teamed with Hulk Hogan and Ron Garvin to defeat Bravo and the Rougeaus. He was scheduled to battle Bravo and Rougeaus in a two out of three falls match at Royal Rumble, so he found partners in The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). Hart Foundation and Rougeau Brothers had been feuding with each other since 1987. Rougeaus unsuccessfully challenged Harts several times for the WWF Tag Team Championship in summer of 1987 but did not become champions. They were in opposite teams against each other at Survivor Series 1988, where Bret eliminated Rougeau in the first place.\nEvent.\nBefore the event aired live on pay-per-view (PPV), Jim Powers defeated Barry Horowitz and Sam Houston defeated Steve Lombardi in dark matches.\nPremilinary matches.\nThe first televised match was a two out of three falls match between Jim Duggan and The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart) vs. Dino Bravo and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques Rougeau and Raymond Rougeau). The powerful Neidhart and Bravo started the match. Duggan tagged in and Bravo ran to tag in Raymond. Duggan caught Raymond and connected with a scoop slam and an Old Glory. Duggan tagged in Bret Hart, who pinned Raymond with an inside cradle for a near-fall. He got Raymond with a sunset flip pinfall and then he hit a diving crossbody for another near-fall. Jacques tagged in and got a near-fall with a sunset flip on Hart but Hart clotheslined Jacques and took him to the corner. Jacques' partners did his help but Neidhart grinded Bravo and Raymond by a shoulder block. Raymond pulled the rope down causing Hart to fall on the floor. Bravo hit a side suplex in the ring but didn't cover and instead tagged in Raymond who hit Hart with a Bombe de Rougeau and pinned him to get the first fall. Rougeau brothers continued to beat Hart, who was caught in Jacques' Boston crab. Hart managed to reach in his corner. Jacques tried to hit a bulldog on Hart but Hart countered it into an inverted atomic drop. Duggan tagged in and hit a scoop slam on Raymond, followed by a forearm smash by Neidhart. He hit Bravo with a shoulder block and Duggan slingshotted Hart on Raymond and hit an elbow drop on Raymond and pinned him, getting the second fall. Bravo tagged in and hit Duggan with an atomic drop, sending Duggan in the corner who tagged Hart. Hart followed it up with a backbreaker on Bravo but Raymond shoved him from the ropes when Hart tried to hit an elbow drop. All the six men began brawling. The referee was distracted. Duggan took advantage and hit Bravo with his 2x4. Hart pinned Bravo to get the third fall and the victory.\nThe second match was for the WWF Women's Championship between defending champion Rockin' Robin and Judy Martin. Before the match began, former champion Sensational Sherri was in the ring and challenged the winner to a future championship match claiming neither were as much woman as she was, before joining Gorilla Monsoon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura at the announcers table. Robin and Martin had a lot of near-falls during the match. However, in the end, Robin hit Martin with a diving crossbody and pinned her to win the match and retain the title.\nNext was a posedown between WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Ultimate Warrior and Rick Rude. The winner had to be decided by fan reaction. There were four categories: \"Double Biceps\", \"Best Abs\", \"Most Muscular\" and \"Medley of Poses\". Warrior won in every posedown. Rude, however, attacked Warrior with his own metal workout bar. This posedown was so successful and so well-received by the audience that it led to the launch of the World Bodybuilding Federation the following year.\nThe third match was between King Haku and Harley Race. The winner of that match would win the \"King of Wrestling\" crown, held by Haku. Race began the match by hitting Haku with knee lifts and suplexes. Haku no-sold Race headbutts. Race hit Haku with a piledriver for a near-fall. Haku suplexed Race for a near-fall. He missed an elbow drop on Race and both men went to the floor. Haku backdropped a piledriver attempt by Race. Race hit a swinging neckbreaker for another near-fall. Haku made a comeback by hitting Race with chops but missed a flying splash. Race missed a diving headbutt. Both men got up and Race ran through the ropes but Haku hit him with a thrust kick to win the match. This match was edited off the Coliseum Video release but included in the Royal Rumble Anthology DVD edition as well as the version on the WWE Network.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the 1989 Royal Rumble match. The first Royal Rumble occurred in 1988, but it consisted of 20 men. The 1989 Royal Rumble was the second Royal Rumble but the first to have 30 men and the first to air on pay-per-view. WWF Tag Team Champions Demolition (Ax and Smash) drew Nos. 1 and 2 in the match. The two tag team championship partners battled with each other until the #3 entrant André the Giant came in. They battled André until Mr. Perfect entered at #4. André eliminated Smash while Perfect and Ax began working on him. Ron Garvin entered at #5 and he also assisted Perfect and Ax in triple-teaming André, who was the largest person in the match. Greg Valentine entered at #6 while André eliminated Garvin. Perfect, Ax and Valentine triple-teamed André until Jake Roberts entered at #7. This made Roberts the first man to participate in two Royal Rumble events. The other participants let André and Roberts worked on him alone. Andre choked Roberts and threw him over the top rope. Ron Bass entered at #8. Ax and Bass battled each other while Perfect and Valentine restarted double-teaming André; André eventually got the upper hand and, after beating back Perfect, began choking Valentine until he was unconscious. One half of The Rockers, Shawn Michaels entered at #9. Perfect hit a back body drop on Ax over the top rope, eliminating him. He tried to eliminate Michaels too but Michaels used a skin the cat to come back into the ring and almost tossed Perfect. Butch Miller, one half of The Bushwhackers entered at #10. Jake Roberts came back and tossed his snake Damien inside the ring. André saw the snake, freaked out and eliminated himself from the match. Roberts took his snake and went back. The Honky Tonk Man entered at #11. Honky and Valentine both tried to eliminate Michaels but failed. One half of Strike Force, Tito Santana entered at #12 and beat out Perfect before focusing on Valentine. Bass and Perfect double suplexed Michaels. Bad News Brown entered at #13. Santana and Butch eliminated Honky while Brown messed around with Michaels until Michaels' tag team partner Marty Jannetty entered at #14. They both got together and double dropkicked Ron Bass over the top rope. Santana hit Valentine with a flying forearm smash.\nOne half of The Mega Powers, WWF World Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage entered at #15 and went after Brown. Valentine hit Savage with a Hammer Drop and tried to eliminate him but Savage stayed in. Santana aided Savage in beating Valentine until one half of The Brain Busters, Arn Anderson entered at #16. Savage backdropped Valentine over the top rope. Anderson and Savage clotheslined Michaels over the top rope, eliminating him. Jannetty pounded on Anderson. Anderson's tag team partner Tully Blanchard entered at #17. Jannetty and Blanchard beat each other. Perfect and Savage nicely exchanged each other's moves. Anderson aided Blanchard in hitting Jannetty with a spinning spinebuster. Blanchard dumped Jannetty over the top rope but Jannetty grabbed the second rope to stay in the match, \nonly to be eliminated by Blanchard anyway. Savage's tag team partner Hulk Hogan entered at #18 and dumped out Perfect. However, Perfect broke the longevity record, lasting 27:58. Anderson dumped Santana. Brown and Hogan had near-eliminations with each other. Butch's tag team partner Luke Williams entered at #19. Hogan and Brown eliminated Butch, leaving six men in the ring. Hogan and Savage were double-teamed by other four men Brown, Anderson, Blanchard and Luke. Koko B. Ware entered at #20 and dropkicked all four of them. Anderson climbed over the top rope but Hogan scoop slammed him. Koko hunted Hogan but was dumped out over the ring, getting eliminated. Hogan punched The Brainbusters away and then eliminated Luke. The Brainbusters went for a double clothesline on Hogan but he ducked and instead clotheslined them over the top rope. The Warlord, one half of The Powers of Pain entered at #21, but as soon as he entered the ring, he was eliminated by Hogan. Warlord set the record of the shortest time in the ring with spending only 2 seconds in the ring, a record that stood 20 years until Santino Marella was eliminated in 1 second at the 2009 Royal Rumble. Brown and Savage battled each other. Hogan dumped both men out. Savage berated Hogan, beginning the breakup of Mega Powers. The two tried to battle each other until Miss Elizabeth told them to calm down. The duo embraced before Savage left.\nOne half of The Twin Towers, the Big Boss Man entered at #22. Hogan scoop slammed Big Boss Man but Boss Man hit him a corner avalanche and a piledriver. Hogan tried to get rid of Boss Man, until Boss Man's tag team partner Akeem entered at #23. The duo double-teamed Hogan and eliminated him. Hogan's friend Brutus Beefcake entered at #24 and took on the Twin Towers. Despite being officially eliminated, Hogan remained at ring side and fought with Boss Man outside. After intervention from match officials, the Boss Man re-entered the ring and Twin Towers double-teamed Beefcake until Hogan pulled the rope down, sending the Boss Man over the top rope and eliminating him from the match. The duo continued to battle each other all the way to the locker room. With this last elimination, Hogan broke the elimination record in a single Royal Rumble match with ten. Akeem tried to eliminate Beefcake until The Red Rooster entered at #25. Rooster and Beefcake double-teamed the big Akeem until the Warlord's tag team partner The Barbarian entered at #26 and broke up Rooster and Beefcake's double-teaming on Akeem. He battled with Beefcake while Rooster received a 747 Splash by Akeem. Big John Studd entered at #27 and went after Akeem. Hercules entered at #28 followed by already eliminated Tito Santana's tag team partner Rick Martel, who entered at #29. Everyone was punching each other before the final entrant, Ted DiBiase entered at #30. DiBiase bought the slot from manager Slick to get a better spot. He eliminated Rooster and then went after his rival Hercules, whom DiBiase had bought as a slave. Beefcake saved DiBiase and battled Hercules. DiBiase sneaked out behind and eliminated both men from the ring, leaving it to the final five participants – Akeem, Barbarian, Studd, Martel and DiBiase. Barbarian manhandled Martel but Martel was able to avoid a clothesline by Barbarian. He dropkicked Barbarian over the top rope, leaving it to Akeem, Studd, Martel and DiBiase. Martel hit a diving crossbody on Akeem but the big man caught him and throw him over the top rope. Akeem, Studd and DiBiase were the final three participants. DiBiase and Akeem spent some time in double-teaming Studd before they quarreled with each other. Studd took advantage and dumped Akeem. Studd and DiBiase remained the final two participants. Studd slammed DiBiase and followed it up with a butterfly suplex. After a clothesline, Studd threw DiBiase over the top rope to eliminate him and win the 1989 Royal Rumble. This made Studd the first man to win a 30-man Royal Rumble (the previous match had 20 entrants).\nAftermath.\nThe Royal Rumble became an important part in the breakup of The Mega Powers. Hulk Hogan accidentally eliminated Randy Savage from the match. On the February 3 \"The Main Event II\", Hogan and Savage faced The Twin Towers (Akeem and Big Boss Man) in a tag team match, filled with controversy. During the climax of the match, Akeem threw Savage through the ropes onto the floor with Savages body hitting Elizabeth in the process. Hogan did not help Savage and turned his attention to an unconscious Elizabeth. Savage questioned what was happening but Hogan did not reply. Hogan picked Liz up and took her to backstage. Hogan left Savage alone in the ring to handle the Twin Towers. When Hogan returned to the ring, Savage slapped him in the face, took the championship belt and left Hogan alone in the ring with the Twin Towers. Hogan still managed to pick up the win, however, but afterward got into a heated argument with Savage backstage. Savage declared that Hogan was jealous of him, that he lusted after Elizabeth, and that he would defeat Hogan if it came to it for the belt. Hogan tried to talk sense into Savage but was unsuccessful as the Macho Man turned heel on his now former partner by attacking both him and Brutus Beefcake, who tried to intervene on Hogan's behalf. Hogan and Savage then began feuding with each other, which culminated in a match at WrestleMania V dubbed \"The Mega Powers Explode\" where Savage, who had won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship over a year earlier at WrestleMania IV with Hogan in his corner, would defend against his former friend. Hogan defeated Savage to win the title ending Savage's reign of 371 days.\nJake Roberts and André the Giant continued their feud during the rest of the winter of 1989, with the returning Big John Studd becoming involved in their WrestleMania V match as the guest referee.\nThe Ultimate Warrior vowed revenge against Rick Rude for his attack after the posedown, to which Rude replied that he wanted a match for the Intercontinental Championship held by Warrior. Over the next couple of months, Rude would regularly appear at ringside midway through Warrior's matches with World champion Savage, luring the Warrior outside and causing him to be counted out (then afterwards embracing Savage to emphasise the latter's heel turn.) At WrestleMania V, Rude won the Intercontinental title, using outside interference from manager Bobby Heenan to pin Warrior. Rude thus became the first champion in the Heenan Family.\nThe Rockin' Robin-Judy Martin match for the WWF Women's Championship match was the last women's match for a championship title conducted at a major WWF pay-per-view event for nearly five years. Robin left the company in June 1989 and – with little to no interest in women's wrestling at the time – the title was deactivated in February 1990. The title remained vacant until 1993, when Alundra Blayze won a tournament to become the new champion.\nThe Royal Rumble marked the WWF PPV debut of The Bushwhackers, who arrived in WWF in December 1988 after leaving WCW whilst in the finals of their United States Tag Team titie tournament. The Bushwhackers would go on to feud with the Brain Busters throughout the early part of 1989 on the house show circuit. Another PPV debut was former NWA World Heavyweight Champion \"Rugged\" Ronnie Garvin, who also arrived in December 1988 from a run in the AWA, after the Rumble he and Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine would feud where they exchanged televised pinfall victories on \"WWF Superstars of Wrestling\", with Valentine winning a \"retirement match\" on \"Superstars\".\nSteve Lombardi would be repackaged as \"The Brooklyn Brawler\" on an episode of \"Prime Time Wrestling\" later in January 1989 where he attacked The Red Rooster on the set of PTW at the urging of Bobby Heenan, which also \"injured\" host Gorilla Moonson and started a feud between the two.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.\n^Jake Roberts had already been eliminated when he returned from the locker room with his bag. He then removed his pet, a boa constrictor called \"Damien\", from the bag and then slid into the ring to chase André The Giant away, who quickly eliminated himself over the top rope to escape Jake and his pet snake."

        "text": "Michael Carey (born August 17, 1949) is a former American football official in the National Football League (NFL). His uniform number was 94. Prior to his officiating career, he played college football as a running back for Santa Clara University.\nCarey was a respected official in the NFL for his thorough pre-game preparation, professional demeanor, and fair play. In a poll conducted by ESPN in 2008, Carey tied with referee Ed Hochuli for most \"best referee\" votes among NFL head coaches. He had also ejected the most players in the league among current referees, as of 2002, including incidents involving Sean Taylor and Terrell Suggs. In his nineteenth year as referee with the 2013 NFL season, Carey's officiating crew consisted of umpire Chad Brown, head linesman Mark Baltz, line judge Tim Podraza, field judge Mike Weir, side judge Doug Rosenbaum and back judge Kirk Dornan.\nCarey was designated as referee of Super Bowl XLII between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, becoming the first African American referee to receive the prestigious assignment. Carey officiated the same two teams when they played each other during the final week of the 2007 NFL season.\nAt the time of his retirement, Carey was one of the two senior referees in the NFL, along with Walt Coleman. Carey was promoted in 1995 when the league added the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars and thus needed an extra officiating crew to handle up to 15 games per weekend instead of 14, which had been the case between 1976 and 1994.\nPersonal.\nEarly years.\nCarey attended and later graduated from Santa Clara University in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in biology. While at SCU, he played running back for four years until an ankle injury ended his playing career. The injury continues to impact Carey today as it limits his running ability. He only allows himself to run on days he is scheduled to officiate games.\nFamily.\nCarey currently resides in San Diego, California, along with his wife, Wendy. Wendy, also a graduate of SCU, is the chief financial officer of Seirus Innovation. The couple have two daughters, Drisana and Danica. Mike Carey's older brother, Don Carey, is also a retired NFL official. He worked as a back judge from the 2010 NFL season until 2013; before that, he was a field judge from to , a back judge from to and a referee in .\nEntrepreneur and inventor.\nMike and Wendy Carey founded Seirus Innovation, a privately held company that manufactures ski and snowboarding gloves, face protection, and other cold-weather accessories, in 1979. In September 2007, Mike Carey was named Chairman of the Board for SnowSports Industries America (SIA). As chair, his goal is to \"get the suppliers, retailers, reps, media and resorts to come together as one community and work together, then we can create synergy to help strengthen the snow sports industry as a whole.\"\nCarey is an inventor who owns or shares eight ski apparel patents, including \"Cat Tracks,\" a device which he created at age 30 to slip over the sole of a ski boot to provide increased traction when walking.\nOfficiating career.\nEarly years.\nCarey began officiating football in 1972 working Pop Warner football games in the San Diego, California, area after a suggestion by a friend. Progressing to the college level in 1985, he joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). In the WAC, he officiated three bowl games.\nNational Football League.\nCarey was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a side judge, before being promoted to referee for the start of the 1995 NFL season. He became the second African American referee in NFL history after Johnny Grier in 1988. In addition to being selected as referee in Super Bowl XLII, he served as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXVI. In addition to the Super Bowl, he has officiated two conference championship games, four divisional playoffs, and eight wild card games throughout his career as of the conclusion of the 2007-08 NFL playoffs.\nCarey has worked memorable games throughout his career, most notably during the 2005 NFL season. On October 3, 2005, Mike and Don Carey became the first brothers to officiate an NFL game together when they were assigned on the same officiating crew for the game between the Carolina Panthers and Green Bay Packers.\nThe following week of the 2005 regular season on October 9, 2005, Carey was involved in a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions, which featured a pair of ejections and 21 penalties for the Ravens. In the third quarter with Detroit possession from Baltimore's 6 yard line, Terrell Suggs was penalized for roughing Detroit quarterback Joey Harrington following an incomplete pass. Suggs then quickly approached Mike Carey to argue the call and was immediately ejected from the game. After the game, Carey spoke to reporters and said, \"He bumped me with malice in his heart and he was gone. He said a number of things to me.\"\nTwo months later at the start of overtime during a game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in December 2005, Carey was unable to locate a coin to use for the coin toss. He had given his coin to a child, who served as the Packers' honorary captain, at the game's opening kickoff. The field judge was able to supply Carey with a penny.\nCarey was the referee during a 2005-06 playoff game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins. At the conclusion of a play during this game, Redskins safety Sean Taylor spat in the face of Buccaneers running back Michael Pittman. Pittman retaliated with a slap to Taylor's helmet. Carey could be heard through a live microphone immediately ejecting Taylor from the game. Head linesman Steve Stelljes conferred with Carey over Pittman's actions, but Carey decided not to penalize Pittman for his retaliation. When questioned about taking no action against Pittman by Redskins players, Carey said in response to being spat upon, \"What would you do?\" Mike Pereira, the vice president of officiating, approved of Carey's handling of the incident saying that \"offsetting personal fouls would not have been appropriate\". Pereira added, \"If anybody didn't eject somebody for spitting in somebody's face, I'd be disappointed.\"\nIn an interview in August 2014, it was revealed that Carey had requested that the NFL not assign him to games featuring the Washington Redskins. A search of game logs revealed Carey had not worked a preseason or regular season game involving the Redskins since the opening week of the 2006 season.\nSuper Bowl XLII.\nNearly two years later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's championship game, Carey said it was a \"personal honor\" and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he said it was a \"great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding\". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is \"in the grasp and control\" of the defense. Carey determined that \"grasp and control\" was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, \"I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [Manning's] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and then he started to come right back at me.\"\nOther work.\nOn June 24, 2014, Carey resigned from the NFL and joined CBS Sports as a rules analyst for its Thursday night and Sunday broadcasts. He provided analysis, interpretation, and explanations from the game site, as well as the NFL Network's studios in Culver City, California, on Thursdays and from \"The NFL Today\" set in New York on Sunday. Carey's contract was not renewed after the 2015 season, after several on-air mistakes regarding calls.\nCarey was replaced as referee by first-year NFL official Brad Allen."

        "title": "1925 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1925 Stanley Cup Finals saw the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) champion Victoria Cougars defeat the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Montreal Canadiens three games to one in a best-of-five game series. The Canadiens were substitute NHL representatives, as the final series to decide the NHL champion was not played.\nThe Cougars were the last non-NHL team to win the Cup as the WCHL (renamed the Western Hockey League for the 1925–26 season) folded after 1926, leaving the Stanley Cup to become the NHL's \"de facto\" championship trophy. The Cougars would also be the last team based west of Chicago to win the Cup until the Edmonton Oilers won the trophy in 1984. These were also the last Stanley Cup Finals games to be played in Western Canada until the Vancouver Canucks qualified for the 1982 Finals. Games one, three, and four were held in Victoria. Game two, held in Vancouver, was the last neutral site game in Stanley Cup Finals history that did not involve the New York Rangers until the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals.\nPath to the Finals.\nPrior to the season, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) folded and two of its teams, the Cougars and the Vancouver Maroons joined the WCHL. Victoria finished the 1924–25 WCHL regular season in third place, but eventually upset the Calgary Tigers in the two-game total goals WCHL championship series by a combined score of 3–1.\nMeanwhile, the Canadiens also finished the NHL regular season in third place. In the NHL playoffs, Montreal went on to beat the second place Toronto St. Patricks, 5–2, in a two-game total goals series. The winner of that series was to go on and play the first place Hamilton Tigers. However, the Tigers were suspended after Hamilton players staged a strike in an attempt to receive more compensation because the league extended the regular season from 24 to 30 games. As a result, the Canadiens were declared the 1924–25 NHL champions.\nGame summaries.\nWith the demise of the PCHA, the Stanley Cup playoffs reverted to a single best-of-five series to determine the champion. However, the Cup Finals still annually rotated between the east and the west, and thus all of the games in the 1925 Finals were played on the West Coast. Games one, three, and four were played at the 4,200 seat Patrick Arena in Victoria; game two was played at the Denman Arena in Vancouver. The decision to use the larger Denman Arena (10,500 seats) for game two was based on the huge demand for tickets. The Cougars jumped to a two games to none series lead with 5–2 and 3–1 victories, but the Canadiens won game three, 4–2. In game four, Gizzy Hart scored the game-winning goal in Victoria's 6–1 win to clinch the Cup.\nCougars goaltender Hap Holmes recorded a 2.00 goal-against average for the series. Jack Walker led Victoria in goals with four, while Frank Fredrickson scored three. Overall, eight different player combining for the Cougars' 16 goals.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1925 Stanley Cup was presented to Cougars captain Clem Loughlin by the trophy's trustee William Foran, following the Cougars 6–1 win over the Canadiens in game four.\nThe following Cougars players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1924–25 Victoria Cougars"

        "title": "Serbia men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Serbia men's national basketball team () represents Serbia in international basketball competition, and is controlled by the Basketball Federation of Serbia. Serbia is currently ranked fourth in the FIBA World Ranking.\nFrom 1992 to 2003, the national team played under the name of FR Yugoslavia and from 2003 to 2006, under the name of Serbia and Montenegro in international tournaments. Following the Montenegrin declaration of independence in 2006, Basketball Federation of Serbia retained the place of Basketball Federation of Serbia and Montenegro as a FIBA member. Therefore, all the results and medals from this period are succeeded by the Serbia national team.\nHistory.\nSerbia and Montenegro.\nWith the start of Yugoslav Wars in 1991, and subsequent breakup of Yugoslavia, the Yugoslavia national team was disbanded. The team consisted of players selected from the population of over 23 million people, and the basketball infrastructure was evenly distributed among the six states which formed the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\nIn 1992, FR Yugoslavia was established as the federation of the two remaining Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro. The newly established country had less than half the population of the former country. The Basketball Federation of FR Yugoslavia became the governing body of basketball for the new country. After the adoption of UNSCR 757, the national team was suspended from participating in international tournaments. Due to these sanctions and ongoing war, the national team was prevented from participating at the 1992 Summer Olympics, EuroBasket 1993 and 1994 FIBA World Cup.\n1995–2002: Golden generation.\nWithout much sponsorship for the war-impoverished country, the national team made its comeback to the international scene at the EuroBasket 1995 in Greece, where it won the gold medal; after defeating Lithuania in the final. At the 1996 Summer Olympics, the team lost 69–95 to the United States in the gold-medal game. After the defeat, the national team would go on to claim the gold medal in their next two international competitions, EuroBasket 1997 and the 1998 FIBA World Cup; while winning the bronze medal at EuroBasket 1999 and reclaiming gold once again at the EuroBasket 2001.\nOne of the most notable wins for the Yugoslavia national team came in the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIBA World Cup, where the host nation of the tournament, the United States was eliminated 81–78. The significance of the win was tremendous for the Serbian people in general, as the public in Serbia perceived the United States political leadership responsible for the breakup of Yugoslavia, and destruction of the country's infrastructure; as well as civil victims during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Thereafter, the Yugoslavia national team went on to win the competition, by defeating New Zealand in the semi-finals and Argentina in the final 84–77 in OT to win the gold medal.\n2003–2006: Underwhelming results.\nIn 2002, FR Yugoslavia consisted of the states of Serbia and Montenegro. The merged nations came to a new agreement regarding continued co-operation, which, among other changes, promised the end of the name Yugoslavia. On 4 February 2003, the federal assembly of Yugoslavia created a loose state union—the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro. The following years were underwhelming as the national team failed to make the podium at international tournaments, after decades of winning medals.\nAt the EuroBasket 2003, the team came in sixth place, but due to their world champion status, were automatically qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. \nEntering 2004, the national team participated in the less important Diamond Ball tournament, prior to the 2004 Olympic Games where they won the gold medal. Although the team was unable to carry over the momentum heading into the Olympics, and were eliminated in the group stage with a (1–4) record, finishing in 11th place.\nAfter two consecutive tournament disappointments, hopes of getting back on the podium returned for the EuroBasket 2005 where Serbia and Montenegro was the host nation. Heading into the tournament, Željko Obradović was brought back for a second stint as head coach of the national team. However, they were eliminated in the play-off stage by France 74–71, and finished in ninth place. After the tournament, Obradović stepped down, and blamed a bad atmosphere among the team's star players for the failure. The team then participated at the 2006 FIBA World Cup on a wild card, due to the results in the past on the initiative by FIBA prominent administrator Borislav Stanković. Although the national team of Serbia and Montenegro came up short once again, with another ninth-place finish.\nOn 21 May 2006, Montenegrins voted in an independence referendum, with 55.5% supporting independence. The subsequent Montenegrin proclamation of independence in June 2006 and the Serbian proclamation of independence on 5 June ended the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro and thus the last remaining vestiges of the former Yugoslavia.\nSerbia.\nFollowing the dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro, the national team participated at the EuroBasket 2007. There, the team finished the competition failing to make it out of the group stage after three close losses. The result failed to qualify the team for the 2008 Summer Olympics, which was their first time missing the Olympic tournament after missing it in 1992 due to suspension.\nIn December 2007, the legendary Dušan Ivković hinted that he would take the helm as head coach of the national team.\n2009–2013: Flashes of old glory.\nUnder Ivković's coaching, a new generation of players led by Nenad Krstić and Miloš Teodosić returned some of the old glory by taking the silver medal at Eurobasket 2009. At the 2010 FIBA World Cup, after narrowly defeating Croatia in the Round of 16, Miloš Teodosić hit a deep three-point shot to upset the favourites of the tournament Spain in the quarter-finals. Entering the semis, Serbia would come up short, after a controversial referee's error to the tournament's host Turkey 83–82. With the youngest team in the competition, Serbia eventually finished in fourth place after losing to Lithuania 99–88 in the bronze-medal game.\nAt the EuroBasket 2011, the team failed to reach the semi-finals, finishing the tournament in eighth place; thus failing to qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics. At the EuroBasket 2013, the team was once again eliminated in the quarter-finals and finished in seventh place.\n2014–2019: Silver generation.\nFollowing the EuroBasket 2013, Ivković stepped away from the position, and Serbian basketball hall of famer Aleksandar Đorđević stepped into his place.\nĐorđević led the team to the silver medal at the 2014 FIBA World Cup, where they lost in the final to the United States. At the EuroBasket 2015, Serbia finished in fourth place, with their only tournament loses coming in the semi-finals to Lithuania and in the bronze-medal game to France.\nAfter winning the 2016 Olympic Qualifying Tournament held in Belgrade, the national team won the silver medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, losing in the final to the United States.\nWith the absence of team captains Miloš Teodosić, and Nikola Jokić, rising star Bogdan Bogdanović emerged as team leader at the EuroBasket 2017. The national team went on to earn their third silver medal in four years, after falling to a Goran Dragić-led Slovenia 93–85 in the final.\nFacing a different qualification system introduced by FIBA for the 2019 FIBA World Cup, the national team was forced to play without their key players in nearly all of their qualification matches. However, they narrowly secured the last spot for the World Cup in their second round qualification group. Prior the World Cup, Serbia was dubbed as one of the favourites to win the tournament; but was eventually defeated in the quarter-finals by Argentina.

His current role within rugby is uncertain following his last employer, the Austin Gilgronis, being expelled from the MLR.\n He was an American rugby union coach of the United States national rugby union team, the Eagles. Hodges is a former professional rugby union player, professional, collegiate American football player, and collegiate American football coach. Hodges was captain of the U.S. national rugby team for 28 matches, a U.S. record that stood until 2013. Since retiring from the international game, Dave has had a long run of bad fortune in the business of rugby. He was let go from Rhino Rugby as the Vice President of Sales, let go from USA Rugby after a woeful 2019 Rugby World Cup as the Men's National Team General Manager, and more recently has found himself out of work after his most recent employer, the Austin Gilgronis, we're expelled from the MLR.\nHigh school and collegiate years.\nHodges played American football at Long Beach Wilson High School in Long Beach, California, as a linebacker. It was during this period that Hodges saw his first rugby match as Belmont Shore Rugby Club practiced and played their matches on the same field that Hodges' high school team played football.\nHodges played American football throughout his college years at Occidental College in Los Angeles, California and received accolades in each of his four collegiate seasons. Hodges was named a Kodak All-American football player, an award given annually to the best American college football players at their respective positions.\nHodges began playing rugby at 18 as a freshman at Occidental College. Within two years, Hodges was named as a Collegiate All-American in 1990 and 1991. Teammates and opponents speak highly of his leadership and athleticism. Greg Jenkins, a teammate said, \"He's (Hodges) a leader--a great athlete with leverage, agility and aggressiveness. No one can match his ability. He's pretty much in a league of his own.\"\nUS national rugby team.\nHodges was capped 54 times by the United States national rugby union team at lock, flanker and at number eight. He made his debut as a substitute against Uruguay in 1996 at Fletcher's Fields in Markham, Ontario, Canada.\nHodges was the U.S. national team Captain 27 times during 2000 through 2003. Hodges won the USA Rugby Athlete of the Year in 2005.\nA match between the United States and France on July 3, 2004, marked the final game that Hodges represented the United States as a player. After nine years of service to the Eagles, Hodges explained his decision to retire. \"I think now is the right time. I'm still playing at a high level and I think I wanted to be a part of the team, as long as I was selected, and of the transition . . . We’re building for the next World Cup and so the more I stay around, that’s one less guy in the XV that coach has experience for the next World Cup.\"\nProfessional rugby career.\nHodges played professional rugby with Llanelli RFC from 1997–1999 and 2001–2005. Hodges played for Bridgend RFC in 1999–2000. In 2001 and 2002, he was named Player of the Year for the Llanelli Scarlets. He was also the strength coach for the Llanelli Scarlets from 2001–2004. When Hodges announced his retirement from playing professional rugby, Llanelli Scarlets chief executive Stuart Gallacher said, \"David has been a highly influential member of our squad for seven years.

The Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Vancouver Millionaires swept the National Hockey Association (NHA) champion Ottawa Senators three games to none in a best-of-five game series. The finals were played in Vancouver, with games one, three and five played under PCHA rules. The Millionaires became the first team from the PCHA to win the Cup. This was the second Stanley Cup championship series between the champions of the NHA and the PCHA and the first held in a PCHA rink.\nPaths to the Finals.\nIn 1914 the PCHA and NHA agreed to a yearly challenge series between the two teams that won each league for the right to hold the Stanley Cup, effectively ending the challenge era for the Cup.\nVancouver finished the 1914–15 PCHA regular season in first place, and thus winning that league's title, with a record of 13–4. Meanwhile, Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers both finished the 1914–15 NHA regular season tied for first place with identical 14–6 records, and thus had to play a two-game total goals series to determine the NHA champion. Ottawa won this series 4–1 to advance to the Stanley Cup Finals. Ottawa left for Vancouver, which hosted the series that year, on March 15. Vancouver captain Si Griffis missed the series due to a broken leg from an exhibition series against NHA all-stars held while waiting for the Finals to start.\nGame summaries.\nAll games of the championship finals were played at Vancouver's Denman Arena, the home of the PCHA champion Millionaires. Vancouver ended up sweeping the series with victories of 6–2, 8–3, and 12–3, scoring 26 total goals while limiting the Senators to just eight overall. Former Senator Cyclone Taylor led the Millionaires with six goals. Future Hockey Hall of Famer Barney Stanley scored five goals, including three in the second period of game three. The Cup was not brought west to Vancouver by the Senators, so was not immediately presented to the winners.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1915 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran.\nThe following Millionaires players and staff were eligible to have their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1914–15 Vancouver Millionaires"

As of 24 January 2022, Israel is ranked 60th in the IRB World Rankings.\nTheir home ground is at the Wingate Institute in Netanya, Central District, known for its large number of immigrants from English-speaking countries.\nHistory.\nThe sport was brought to the country by British soldiers during the Mandate era, but petered out after the British left. A wave of immigration from English-speaking countries since 1967 has seen renewed interest in the sport, particularly in areas with large English-speaking populations such as Ra'anana and Jerusalem.\nA national league was set up in 1972, and the Israel Rugby Union (now Rugby Israel) formed in 1975.

        "title": "Kenya national rugby union team",
        "text": " \nThe Kenya national rugby union team, commonly known as the Simbas (Swahili for \"lions\"), is the country's national team managed by the Kenya Rugby Union.\nThe team plays in \"red\", \"green\", and \"black\" jerseys with \"black\" or \"white\" shorts.\nThe Simbas represent Kenya in the Africa Cup and various other tournaments across the continent. \nThey currently rank 34 in the World Rugby Rankings and fourth in Africa. Kenya is yet to qualify for the Rugby World Cup.\nThe Simbas' home ground is the RFUEA Ground which opened to an East Africa side against the British and Irish Lions in 1955.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1909–1960s).\nRugby Union was introduced to Kenya at the beginning of the 20th century by British settlers and the first recorded match was in 1909. The game was initially restricted to whites only.\nIn 1923, the primary club in Kenya, Nairobi District, was split into Nondescripts RFC and Kenya Harlequin F.C., due to the club's overwhelming strength. In the 1950s the first internationals began taking place. Early competitions included the Nairobi District Championships first held in 1925, a Royal Armed Forces tournament first held in 1937 and the Enterprise Cup which has been in existence since 1930.\nKenya played host to touring sides between the 1920s and the 1950s; notably including University of Cape Town, Stellenbosch University and a Combined Universities (Oxford and Cambridge) team at Mitchell Park Stadium in 1951.\nBy 1953, the Rugby Football Union of East Africa was formed to oversee rugby in the three East African colonies of Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika. A Kenya Colony team played a Tanganyika team for the first time in 1954 and a Uganda Protectorate team in 1958 with the Kenyan representative side winning 21–11. Often, the Kenyan side was combined with other East African nations, and composed of players of European ethnicity. While the results were often lopsided, these games provided a huge amount of revenue for rugby in Kenya, and were incredibly beneficial. Kenya, as an independent side, played its first game against Tanganyika, proving to be victorious.\nIndependence and integration (1970s–1980s).\nPost-independence, the desegregation of the Kenyan school system meant that indigenous black Africans' featured in the rugby sides of elite schools such as Duke of York and Prince of Wales. Players such as Chris Onsotti, John Gichinga, Dennis Awori, George Kariuki and Jim Owino would form the first generation of indigenous black African rugby players.\nIn 1972, Ted Kabetu became the first indigenous black Kenyan to play for the East Africa Tuskers in a match against Richmond RFC. That same year, the Tuskers toured Ireland, playing Irish club sides, achieving moderate success and winning 3 out of their 8 tests; Chris Onsotti became the first forward black Tusker playing at prop on the Fourth Tuskers Tour of Ireland in 1972; and Jackson \"Jacko\" Omaido a school boy at Lenana School (formerly Duke of York) represented the Tuskers playing at fly-half at a 1975 tour of Zambia.\nAn influx of players from Tanganyika due to a flight of expatriates would boost the Kenyan game. During the early 1970s, a number of English clubs began touring Kenya, playing unofficial test matches against the Tuskers. This included Harlequins RFC nearly being beaten, only for the Tuskers to lose 20–15.\nAfter an invitation in the local dailies to black African rugby players, Miro RFC was formed as an invitational side; rather like the Barbarians or local equivalents, Scorpions RFC. Miro were an all black African side and included two white players (Doug Hamilton and Pat Orr); considered to have played an important role in bringing black Africans into rugby in Kenya. The team played Rugby Roma Olimpic in 1976, winning 20–12. However, the side was disbanded over questions of the racial selection of players.\nThe Tuskers, by the mid 1970s being fully integrated with both black and whites, faced Zambia, winning 4 tests out of 5. Around this time, some clubs began folding due to the flight of white expatriate players. Despite the growth, conflicts emerged between the black Kenyan players and the many clubs which were still run by expatriates; Miro RFC played again in 1979, this time recording triumph against Blackheath F.C. 32–19, providing major hope for black African rugby.\nMean Machine RFC and Mwamba RFC both founded in 1977 as indigenous African rugby sides. Mean Machine, a representative side of the University of Nairobi featuring Absalom \"Bimbo\" Mutere, Thomas Onyango Oketch and football international Joe \"JJ\" Masiga were notable for winning the Kenya Cup on their first attempt. Black Blad RFC representing Kenyatta University College would follow thereafter. Mean Machine were however disbanded as a result of the closure of Nairobi University after the failed coup of 1982.\nMiro RFC continued to play, but lost to the Metropolitan Police club of London 40–9, a side that was described as \"makeshift\". Around this time, the Tuskers played their last tour in 1982, defeating Zimbabwe and Zambia. The 1980s also saw the introduction of the sevens game. However, the 1980s also saw a decline in the national side; for example, during a qualifier play-off against Zimbabwe, Kenya lost all three of their matches; by the end of the 1980s, Kenya lost to Zimbabwe 56–9.\nMixed fortunes (1990s–present).\nKenya had firmly established stability in its domestic scene, with the game being picked up by the natives, and a league being established. During the 2000s Kenya began to start experiencing success again at the international level, finally being able to consistently record victories against sides such as Zimbabwe and Uganda.\nFor the 2007 Rugby World Cup qualifiers, the team defeated both Tunisia and Namibia at home, only to lose their away legs.\nThe team again failed to qualify for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, losing to Tunisia. In 2011, Kenya won the Africa Cup, beating Tunisia in the final 16–7 after both Morocco and Namibia withdrew due to financial constraints; the following season saw Kenya regress and struggle against Uganda and Zimbabwe, only defeating Tunisia to avoid relegation. The 2013 season proved to be a pivotal moment in Kenyan rugby, as they beat both Uganda and Zimbabwe, winning the Africa Cup for the second time, and the first time in a full four team pool.\nThe Kenyan national team competed in the South African domestic Vodacom Cup competition in 2014, playing as the . The Simba XV were based in Cape Town for the duration of the competition and won their opening match, beating the 17–10. However, they lost their remaining six matches to finish in seventh spot in the Southern Section.\nThe preparation aided in the 2014 Africa Cup with Kenya earning victory over both and . A loss to on match day three resulted in a third-place finish on points difference and Kenya failing to qualify for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. In May 2015, Kenya played a European team for the first time since the East Africa sides of the 1970s and 1980s, defeating Portugal 41–15 in a test match at the RFUEA Ground.\nIn 2016, the Kenya Rugby Union announced a sponsorship deal with betting firm Sportpesa, to a deal worth up to KSh.607 million/=; this is the most lucrative sponsorship deal in Kenyan rugby history, and figures not only to fund 7s and men's XVs, but the women's and youth game as well.

        "title": "Sailing Alone Around the World",
        "text": "Sailing Alone Around the World is a sailing memoir by Joshua Slocum in 1900 about his single-handed global circumnavigation aboard the sloop \"Spray\". Slocum was the first person to sail around the world alone. The book was an immediate success and highly influential in inspiring later travelers.\nBackground.\nCaptain Slocum was a highly experienced navigator and ship owner. He rebuilt and refitted the derelict sloop \"Spray\" in a seaside pasture at Fairhaven, Massachusetts, over 13 months between early 1893 and 1894.\nBetween 24 April 1895 and 27 June 1898, Slocum, aboard the \"Spray\", crossed the Atlantic twice (to Gibraltar and back to South America), negotiated the Strait of Magellan, and crossed the Pacific. He also visited Australia and South Africa before crossing the Atlantic (for the third time) to return to Massachusetts after a journey of 46,000 miles.\nThe book.\nSlocum attracted considerable international interest by his journey, particularly once he had entered the Pacific. He was awaited at most of his ports of call, and gave lectures and lantern-slide shows to well-filled halls. His journal was first published in installments before being issued in book form in 1900. The book was lavishly illustrated.\nSlocum tells his story as a sequence of adventures, understating his own part and giving credit always to the \"Spray\". He invents a crew-member, a supposed pilot of Columbus' \"Pinta\", to take credit for the safety of the vessel while he sleeps.\nThe trip itinerary was as follows: Fairhaven, Boston, Gloucester, Nova Scotia, Azores, Gibraltar, (Morocco), Canary Islands, Cape Verde Islands, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Maldonado, Montevideo, Buenos Aires, Strait of Magellan, Cockburn Channel, Port Angosto, Juan Fernandez, Marquesas, Samoa, Fiji, Sydney, Melbourne, Tasmania, Cooktown, Christmas Island, Keeling Cocos, Rodrigues, Mauritius, Durban, Cape Town, (Transvaal), St Helena, Ascension Island, Devil's Island, Trinidad, Grenada, Newport, Fairhaven.\nHighlights of the journey included perils of sailing blue water, such as fog, gales, danger of collision, loneliness, doldrums, navigation, fatigue, gear failure. Other perils of coastal navigation included pirates, attack by 'savages', embayment, shoals and coral reefs, stranding, and shipwreck.\nPassing by Tierra del Fuego, he was warned that he might be attacked by the indigenous Yahgan Indians in the night, so he sprinkled tacks on the deck. He was awakened in the middle of the night by yelps of pain. He was proud of resourcefully defending himself.\nHe devised a system of lashing the wheel into what a later era might call a kind of mechanical autopilot. He took pride in the fact that the \"Spray\" sailed 2000 miles west across the Pacific without his once touching the helm.\n1950s attempt to recreate Slocum's voyage.\nIn the mid-1950s, Robert Carr of Monkton, Vermont, built a replica of the \"Spray\" using the shipbuilding methods of the late 1800s. He announced his intention to sail around the world recreating Slocum's voyage. While one article reported the replica \"Spray\" and Carr's announcement, there is no documented evidence that he made a circumnavigation."

        "title": "Baseball Stars Professional",
        "text": " is a baseball arcade video game developed and originally published by SNK on 26 April 1990. A follow-up to the original \"Baseball Stars\" on Nintendo Entertainment System, it was one of the launch titles for both the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) and Neo Geo AES (home) platforms, in addition of also being one of the pack-in games for the AES, as well as the first baseball title released for the Neo Geo.\nIn the game, the players compete with either computer-controlled opponents or against other players in matches across various ballparks. Although it was originally launched for the Neo Geo MVS, \"Baseball Stars Professional\" would be later released for both Neo Geo AES and Neo Geo CD in 1991 and 1995 respectively, in addition of being re-released through download services for various gaming consoles, among other ways to play it as of date.\n\"Baseball Stars Professional\" garnered mixed reception from critics upon its original release, with reviewers praising various aspects of the game such as the presentation, visuals and quality of the digitized voice samples but many were divided in regards to the gameplay.\nGameplay.\n\"Baseball Stars Professional\" is a baseball game similar to the original \"Baseball Stars\" and other baseball titles from the era, where players compete in matches against computer-controlled opponents or other players across two ballparks. There are only two modes featured in the game: Tournament is the main single-player mode where one player compete against CPU-controlled opponents in a season. Versus, as the name implies, is a two-player mode where two people compete against each other. Most of the original teams featured in the first \"Baseball Stars\" return in this game, although some of the features within the first game were removed for a more arcade-style approach of the sport, such as team management and the ability to create a new team from the ground up, among others. If a memory card is present, the players are allowed to save their progress and resume into the last match the game saved at through a password system.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Baseball Stars Professional\" was initially launched for arcades on 26 April 1990, and was the first baseball game developed for the Neo Geo platform. The game was also released during the same period for the Neo Geo AES, when the system was originally a rental-only system for video game stores and hotels in Japan, but this was later reversed due to high demand and price, coming into the market as a luxury console on 1 July 1991. It was re-released for the Neo Geo CD on 21 April 1995, with minimal changes compared to the original MVS and AES versions. The game has received multiple re-releases in recent years on various digital distribution platforms such as the Virtual Console, PlayStation Network, Nintendo eShop and Xbox Live.\nReception.\n\"RePlay\" reported \"Baseball Stars Professional\" to be the eighth most-popular arcade game at the time. In Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Baseball Stars Professional\" on their December 15, 1990 issue as being the fourteenth most-popular arcade game at the time.\n\"Baseball Stars Professional\" received mixed reception from critics after its initial launch. \"Famicom Tsūshin\" scored the Neo Geo CD version of the game a 21 out of 40."

        "text": " is a 2-player baseball sports arcade game released by SNK in 1992 for the Neo-Geo console. A less detailed console version was released for the NES by Romstar the same year.\nNeo Geo version.\nThe player can select from one of 18 teams across two leagues: Exciting League (beginner) &amp; Fighting League (expert).\nIt featured 18 teams across 2 leagues (Exciting League and Fighting League) and put more emphasis on the graphics and the gameplay; for example, being able to change pitchers or batters and powering up batters which increased the size of the bat.\nNES version.\n\"Baseball Stars 2\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System was distributed by Romstar in 1992.\nChanges made from the original \"Baseball Stars\", released by SNK in 1989:\nPlayers can still create leagues of up to 125 games (6 teams playing each other 25 times) and view statistics such as League Standings and Top 10 in Average, Home Runs, Runs Batted In, Earned Run Average, Wins and Saves (a peculiar glitch occurs when viewing league leaders; the last pitcher listed on any user-created team in \"View Team\" does not appear in any of the Top 10 leaderboards).\nReception.\n\"RePlay\" reported \"Baseball Stars 2\" to be the sixteenth most-popular arcade game at the time. In Japan, \"Game Machine\" listed \"Baseball Stars 2\" on their June 1, 1992 issue as being the eighth most-successful table arcade unit of the month.\nThe Neo Geo version was critically acclaimed. The first issue of \"GameFan\" reviewed the Neo Geo version, with its two reviewers scoring it 99% and 97%; the former said it \"is far and away the best sports game I have ever played\" and the latter said the \"graphics are incredibly well detailed\" and \"the gameplay is unparalleled\". They concluded that it \"has the best graphics, sound, and game play this side of ESPN\".\nThe NES version was less popular than the original \"Baseball Stars\" was on the NES. Reasons for this included the inability to change the name of a gamer-created team or names of the players on a gamer-created team, and unimproved graphics over the original. A \"Nintendo Power\" review wrote that \"\"Baseball Stars 2\" is such a complete rehash that if you already own the original, it is not worth your money to get this game\".\nRe-releases.\nThe game was included in the \"SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1\" compilation by for PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii, released on 2008.\nThe Neo Geo version was re-released for Wii by D4 Enterprise via the Virtual Console in Japan on October 30, 2007, in PAL regions on November 30, and in North America on December 10.\nSNK Playmore released ports for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable developed by M2 on August 25, 2011, on PlayStation Network via NEOGEO Station in Japan and North America on July 19, and in PAL regions on August 24.\nA port for Linux, OS X, and Windows developed by DotEmu was released by SNK Playmore as part of the Humble NEOGEO 25th Anniversary Bundle on December 8, 2015.

        "title": "1917 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1917 Stanley Cup Finals was contested by the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Seattle Metropolitans and the National Hockey Association (NHA) and Stanley Cup defending champion Montreal Canadiens. Seattle defeated Montreal three games to one in a best-of-five game series to become the first team from the United States to win the Cup. The series was also the first Stanley Cup Finals to be played in the United States, and the last Stanley Cup Finals to not feature a National Hockey League team, as the NHA rebranded as the NHL in November 1917.\nPaths to the Finals.\nSeattle won the PCHA title after finishing the 1916–17 regular season in first place with a 16–8 record. Meanwhile, Montreal, who was the champion of the first half of the NHA season, advanced to the final series after narrowly defeating the Ottawa Senators, 7–6, in a two-game total-goals playoff series to end the 1916–17 NHA season.\nGame summaries.\nThe games of the Finals were played at the Seattle Ice Arena. Games one and three were played under PCHA seven-man rules; games two and four were played under NHA six-man rules. Bernie Morris scored 14 of Seattle's 23 total goals for the series, including six in their 9–1 victory in game four. Future Hockey Hall of Fame goaltender Hap Holmes recorded a 2.90 goals-against average for the Mets.\nMontreal Canadiens NHA champion roster - George Vezina goalie, Bert Corbeau defence, Harry Mummery defence, Edouard \"Newsy\" Lalonde (Captain) Center-Rover Tommy Smith center, Didier Pitre right wing, Reginald \"Reg\" Noble left wing, Jack Laviolette left wing, Louis Berlinguette left wing, Wilfred \"Billy\" Coutu defence spares - Sarsfield \"Steve\" Malone center, George \"Skinner\" Poulin center, Jules Rochon - defence Harold \"Hal\" McNamara defence \nDave Majors defence, Arthur Brooks defence, Joe Maltais right wing, U.P. Boulder (President), George \"Kennedy\" Kendall (Owner/Manager-Coach),\nSeattle Metropolitans PCHA champion roster - Harry \"Happy\" Holmes goalie, Roy Rickey defence, Everard \"Ed\" Carpenter defence, Jack Walker rover-right wing, Bernie Morris center, Frank Foyston (Captain) left wings, Jim Riley left wing, Bobby \"Stubby\" Rowe defence, Carol \"Cully\" Wilson right wing, Pete Muldoon (Owner/Manager-Coach).\nIn game one, Didier Pitre scored four goals as he led the Canadiens to an 8–4 victory. Pitre opened the scoring in the third minute before Morris tied it four minutes later. Jack Laviolette scored twenty seconds later to put the Canadiens ahead, followed by Pitre to put the Canadiens ahead 3–1 after one period. Con Corbeau and Newsy Lalonde scored in the second to put the Canadiens ahead 5–1 after two periods. In the third, Morris and Frank Foyston scored to bring Seattle within two goals, before Pitre scored again. Morris scored to make it 6–4 before Pitre and Corbeau scored to make the final score 8–4.\nSeattle tied the series with a convincing win played under NHA hockey rules. Morris opened the scoring at nine minutes of the first period. Wilson scored to make it 2–0 for Seattle after the first period. Morris and Foyston scored in the second to put Seattle up 4–0 after two periods. Frank Foyston then scored twice in the third period to complete his hat trick and give Seattle a lead of 6–0. Seattle then played defensively but Tommy Smith scored in the final minutes for the Canadiens to spoil the shutout. Frustration boiled over at the start of the third period with a fight between Roy Rickey and Billy Coutu before Harry Mummery jumped into the fray.\nThe game was played at a fast clip with no goals before Morris scored after ten minutes. Montreal's goaltender Georges Vézina made several big saves in the second to hold Seattle off from scoring. Coutu and Rickey had their third fight of the series and Coutu was given a twenty-minute penalty and Rickey a ten-minute period. The Canadiens held off Seattle in an ensuing power play to end the second with Seattle holding a one-goal lead. In the third, Foyston scored after five minutes and Morris scored a quick pair of goals to give Seattle a 4–0 lead.\nIn an individual rush, Morris put the Mets ahead early in the first period. The Canadiens tried to fight back, but were stymied by the defences of Seattle. Seattle scored three times in the second period to put the game out of reach. In the third, the onslaught continued, as the Mets led 7–0 before Laviolette scored to break the shut out.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1917 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Metropolitans never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season.\nIt was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1917 Seattle Metropolitans\" was put onto its then-new collar.\nThe following Metropolitans players and staff were members of the Stanley Cup winning team.\n1916–17 Seattle Metropolitans\nBanner.\nThe Seattle Kraken revealed and hung a banner in honor of their forerunners' achievement on October 27, 2021, the night they hosted the Canadiens for the first time; if one does not include a 1961 exhibition game against the Seattle Totems, the Canadiens had not played a game of professional hockey in Seattle in 102 years – since the 1919 Stanley Cup Finals that was never completed due to the Spanish flu pandemic."

        "text": "Lars Martin Jonsson (born January 2, 1982) is a Swedish former professional ice hockey defenceman. He played most of his career, which lasted from 1999 to 2013, in Sweden for Leksands IF, Timrå IK, HV71, and Brynäs IF. He spent two years in North America playing for the Philadelphia Flyers organization, appearing in eight National Hockey League (NHL) games.\nPlaying career.\nJonsson began playing for Leksands IF of Elitserien in 1999. Shortly after the season ended, he was drafted in the first round of the 2000 NHL Entry Draft by the Boston Bruins. Although the Bruins continually showed interest in him, attempting to sign him several times, they ran into issues with the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement, which now states that European prospects will no longer remain indefinite property of the teams that draft them. As a result, the Bruins chose not to sign him and decided to instead receive the 37th overall pick in the 2006 Draft as compensation. The Bruins selected Yuri Alexandrov, a Russian defenseman who would play 66 games with the Providence Bruins during the 2010-11 AHL season before returning to Russia in 2011.\nOn the first day of free agency, Jonsson signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Flyers. He alternated between the Flyers and their AHL affiliate, the Philadelphia Phantoms. Although an ankle sprain caused him to miss the beginning of the 2006–07 season, he started with the Flyers, mainly on the powerplay, but he was sent down to play for the Phantoms after two games to adjust to North American hockey. He was called back up to the Flyers on November 21, 2006. He was later reassigned to the Phantoms on September 27, 2007.\nHaving spent two seasons in North America, Jonsson returned to the Swedish Elitserien by signing a two-year contract with Brynäs IF on May 15, 2008.\nOn August 15, 2013, Jonsson officially announced his retirement from hockey."

        "title": "FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup",
        "text": "The FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, also known as the Basketball World Cup for Women or simply the FIBA Women's World Cup, is an international basketball tournament for women's national teams held quadrennially. It was created by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA). Its inaugural game was in 1953 in Chile, three years after the first men's World Championship. For most of its early history, it was not held in the same year as the men's championship, and was not granted a consistent quadrennial cycle until 1967. After the 1983 event, FIBA changed the scheduling so that the women's tournament would be held in even-numbered non-Olympic years, a change that had come to the men's tournament in 1970.\nFormerly known as the FIBA World Championship for Women, the name changed shortly after its 2014 edition. From 1986 through 2014, the tournament was held in the same year as the men's FIBA Basketball World Cup, though in different countries. After the 2014 editions of both championships, the men's event was rescheduled on a new four-year cycle (the latest in 2019) to avoid conflict with the men's FIFA World Cup, but the Women's World Cup remains on the same four-year cycle, with editions held in the same years as the men's FIFA World Cup and the finals tournament played a few months after it. The 2022 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup was held in Sydney, Australia. The 2026 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup will be held in Berlin, Germany.\nHistory.\nOnly four nations have won titles in the history of the Women's World Cup. The first tournament was held in 1953 in Chile, with the participation of ten national teams. Despite losing to Brazil in the final round, the United States won the inaugural title. The next tournament which was held in 1957 in Brazil, marked the beginning of the long-time rivalry between the US team and Soviet team, who debuted at the World Championship. The first official match between these teams was played on the last day of the tournament, it was also the decisive match of the championship. Soviet players led after the first half (27–24), but in the second half the Americans managed to achieve victory (51–48) and won their second World title.\nThe third World Championship was held in 1959 in Moscow, Soviet Union. Due to international political tensions, caused by the Cold War, the United States and its allies didn't participate at this tournament, thus only eight Eastern Bloc countries were able to play at the championship. In the absence of the US team, the Soviet team won their maiden World title while Bulgaria took silver medals and Czechoslovakia finished third. But at the next World Championship, which was held in 1964 in Peru, all these Eastern European teams also occupied whole podium – Soviet Union won their second title in a row, Czechoslovakia won silver medals, Bulgaria took bronze while United States finished only at fourth place. This tournament marked the beginning of the era of dominance of the Soviet Union in world women's basketball, which lasted for next two decades. Under leadership of head coach Lidiya Alekseyeva, Soviet team won three next World Championships held in 1967 (Czechoslovakia), 1971 (Brazil) and 1975 (Colombia). The vast majority of medals at these tournaments were won by Eastern European and East Asian teams while United States even failed to qualify into final round. In general, from 1959 to 1975 Soviet team won record five titles in a row by winning all their 40 matches with margin of 10 points and more. Therefore, it was not surprising when the Soviet Union won the inaugural women's Olympic tournament which was held in 1976 in Montreal, Canada (by winning all five matches). Despite losing to the Japan and Soviet Union, the United States managed to finish second and capture silver medals while Bulgaria took Olympic bronze.\nUnfortunately, the next world women's basketball major tournaments were clouded by a series of political boycotts caused by the Cold War. Firstly, the Soviet Union and four other Eastern Bloc countries withdrew from next World Championships which was held in 1979 in South Korea. In spite of losing to the hosts (82–94), United States won all other matches and captured a gold medal thanks to a better head-to-head point difference among the Top 3 teams. It was the third World title for the US team and the first since 1957. The next year the United States boycotted 1980 Olympic tournament which was held in Moscow, Soviet Union. In their absence, Soviet team captured their second Olympic title by winning all 6 matches while the Bulgaria and the Yugoslavia took silver and bronze medals respectively. Therefore, the next World Championship which was held in 1983 in Brazil became the first international major competition for seven years with participation of all the world's top teams. Soviet Union captured their sixth World title by winning all 10 of their matches, but this victory was the most difficult one. In the final group round, the Soviet team won the match against United States with a margin of only one point (85–84) after losing 40–49 at the end of first half. Later in the final match between these two teams the Soviets lost the first half with a score of 37–40, but also managed to achieve victory with a margin of only two points (84–82). Both of those matches had provided other teams with the knowledge that the Soviet Union wasn't as overwhelming a force as it was years prior. The China won their first World Championship medal after their victory over South Korea in a bronze medal match (71–63). Next year the Soviet Union and Hungary boycotted 1984 Olympic tournament which was held in Los Angeles, United States thus allowing the hosts to win their maiden Olympic title. South Korea and China took silver and bronze Olympic medals respectively.\nFortunately, all the world's top teams were able to partake in the next World Championship, which was held in 1986 in Soviet Union. One month before start of tournament, United States won the basketball tournament at the 1986 Goodwill Games in Moscow by beating Soviet Union with great margin of 23 points (83–60). Both reigning Olympic Champions (United States) and World Champions (Soviet Union) won all their group and semifinal matches, and then met in the final match in Moscow. In this final, US team once again proved their superiority by winning with a margin of 20 points (108–88) thus ending the remarkable winning streak of the Soviet team at the World Championships which lasted 56 consecutive matches. This victory became the turning point which marked beginning of the era of dominance of the United States in world women's basketball. At the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, the US team defended their Olympic title by beating the Yugoslavia in the final match (77–70) while the Soviet team failed to reach the final and unexpectively finished only in third place for the first time in their history. At the next World Championship which was held in 1990 in Malaysia, Soviet Union lost in the second group round to Czechoslovakia (79–82) and Yugoslavia (63–64) and finished only at fifth place. It was the first and only time the Soviet women's team had failed to reach the podium at the international level competition. Like two years prior, the United States and Yugoslavia once more met in the final match, and US team achieved victory again (88–78) by winning their sixth World title. Two years later, the United States went to 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain in the status of favorites to win - especially after the Yugoslavian team was banned from competition due to United Nations sanctions. However, the former Soviet players who competed for the Unified Team, as a result of Soviet Union's dissolution in December 1991, managed to achieve surprising success after a shocking victory over United States in the semifinals (79–73) and managed a victory over the China in the final match (76–66). The US team finished in third place. This was the last victory of Soviet-born players at the World level competitions, and the Unified Team ceased to exist after that.\nThe 12th World Championship was held in Australia in 1994, after the dissolution of Soviet Union, SFR Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia. Slovakia became only newly formed national team who managed to qualify to this World Championship. In such situation, United States aimed to return at first position. However, they surprisingly lost semifinal match to Brazil (107–110) and once again finished only at the third place. In the final match, Brazil beat China (96–87) thus breaking US-Soviet duopoly on World Championship which lasted for 41 years. Two years later United States took revenge at the home 1996 Olympic tournament at Atlanta by beating Brazil in the final match with margin of 24 points (111–87). This victory marked beginning of US dominance at the Olympic Games – from 1996 to 2021, they won seven Olympic titles in a row with remarkable winning streak of 55 consecutive matches at Olympic tournaments.\nThe 13th World Championship took place in 1998 in Germany. Russian team participated at this tournament for first time after dissolution of Soviet Union. In the second group round, they lost to United States with great margin of 36 points (60–96) but then managed to reach final where met with US team again. In the final match, United States faced with much stronger resistance – Russia led with margin of 9 points after first half (28–37), but in the second half US team managed to reach advantage and achieved final victory (71–65). Australia won World Championship bronze medals for first time in their history. The similar story took place at the next World Championship which took place in 2002 in China – United States defeated Russian team at the preliminary round with margin of 34 points (89–55) but later they faced with stronger resistance from Russian side in the final. Despite this, US team won final match with margin of 5 points (79–74) and captured seventh World title while Australia took bronze medals for second time in a row. At the next 2006 World Championship in Brazil, Russian team lost to United States at the preliminary round (80–90) and then lost two more matches at the group stage. But after group stage, Russia achieved remarkable victory by beating US team in semifinals (75–68). It was only first defeat of United States for 12 years at the either Olympic Games or World Championships (and the last till nowadays). They finished only at third place after beating hosts in a bronze medal match (99–59). After this success, Russia was unable to show the same resistance to Australian team who won final match with margin of 17 points (91–74). Therefore, Australia became only fourth national team to win either Olympic or World title in the history of women's basketball.\nThe next World Championship took place in 2010 in the Czech Republic. Many people waited for another match between United States and Russia in playoffs. Both teams won all their group matches but then Russia suffered shocking defeat to Belarus in the quarterfinals (53–70). The defending champions, Australia also surprisingly lost quarterfinal match to hosts - Czech team (68–79). In the semifinals, Czech Republic beat Belarus in overtime (81–77) and reach final match for the first time after dissolution of Czechoslovakia. However, in the final match United States looked stronger and managed to return World title after victory with margin of 20 points (89–69). Spain won World Championship medals for first time in their history after beating Belarus in a bronze medal match (77–68). The next three edition were held without participation of Russian team who failed to qualify to 2014 and 2018 tournaments and was banned from participation in the 2022 World Cup due to the invasion of Ukraine. In 2014 US team repeated their success by beating Spain in the final match (77–64). The home team, Turkey managed to reach semifinals for first time in history but failed to win medals after losing to Australia in a bronze medal match (44–74). At the next 2018 World Cup in Spain, United States captured gold again after victory over Australia in a final match (73–56). The home team, Spain reached podium for third time in a row after victory over Belgium in a bronze medal match (67–60).

        "title": "Bay of Plenty Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Bay of Plenty Rugby Union (\"also referred to as \"Bay of Plenty\" or \"BOPRU\"\") is the governing body for rugby union in a portion of the Bay of Plenty Region of New Zealand. Its colours are dark blue and yellow in a hooped design. The BOPRU govern the running of the Bay of Plenty representative team which have won New Zealand's first-tier domestic competition National Provincial Championship (\"Air New Zealand Cup\" and \"ITM Cup\") once. Their most recent victory was the 1976 competition, they were the first side to win the competition. Bay of Plenty also acts as a primary feeder to the Chiefs, who play in the Super Rugby competition.\nThe union also administers all club rugby within the region, including the Bayfair Baywide competition and other senior club rugby. As well, the union is responsible for school rugby.\nHistory.\nBay of Plenty played a prominent role in the early history of rugby in New Zealand. The 1888–89 New Zealand Natives (the first New Zealand representative rugby team to tour beyond Australia) included five Warbrick brothers from the small Bay of Plenty settlement of Matata. Dave Gallaher, the captain of the legendary 1905 All Black Originals, grew up in Katikati. But it was not until 1911 that a separate Bay of Plenty Rugby Football Union was established. Before then Bay of Plenty was included within the South Auckland union. The current nickname for the team is the \"Steamers\".\nRepresentatives.\nBay of Plenty-based players were amongst the most prominent in the formative years of the game, but it was not until 1911 that the Bay of Plenty union was fully affiliated to the national body. Up until this time the BOP union was included within the South Auckland union boundaries. As the boundaries of the new union grew, and new sub-unions were formed, the union achieved its first national representation when A.L. McLean was selected for the All Blacks in 1921. McLean was the first of 22 men who have represented New Zealand while wearing the blue and gold hoops, in addition to the many players who received their rugby education in the Bay of Plenty before achieving higher honours elsewhere. As the heartland of Maori rugby the region has produced a large number of Māori All Blacks, while age group and secondary school teams from throughout the union have also established a long and successful heritage that is the envy of many.\nGreat players.\nSam Cane who hails from Reporoa is the most capped All Black who has represented Bay of Plenty. \nCane has 70 caps for the New Zealand National team and has been the captain since the start of 2020.\nLes McLean was the first of the 22 players who have so far been selected for the All Blacks from Bay of Plenty. He played as a forward in the second and third tests against the 1921 Springboks – and at full-back against New South Wales in 1923.\nHika Reid hails from Ngongotahā near Rotorua, Reid's grandfather, J. Hikatarewa, played for New Zealand Maori in 1913. Reid was selected for the All Blacks in 1980 when test incumbent Andy Dalton was unavailable for what turned out to be a disappointing tour of Australia. Reid's performances at hooker, however, were impressive. A dynamic runner with ball in hand, he revolutionised the way in which hookers played the game. Sean Fitzpatrick was the most famous of those to adopt this high-energy approach. His try in the second test victory over Australia in Brisbane has been described as one of 'the most spectacular tries in test history'. He started and finished a move that began 10 m from his own try line. Despite this sort of ability, for much of his career Reid was Andy Dalton's understudy. By 1986 he had also slipped behind Fitzpatrick, and he was overlooked for the 1987 World Cup.\nGreg Rowlands, a 1976 All Black to Argentina, holds the record for the most games – 161 – and most points – 1008 – for Bay of Plenty.\nHonours.\n1976\n2004 (1)\n1992\nStadia.\nAs being a larger region than most, the Steamers are one of the few teams to have two home stadiums, the Tauranga Domain in Tauranga and Rotorua International Stadium in Rotorua.\nTauranga Domain.\nTauranga Domain has a capacity of 5,000 people and hosted Bay of Plenty games up until 2000 and since 2015. There are also plans for a 20,000 seat boutique stadium, to help revitalise the city centre of Tauranga which has struggled due to the development of suburban malls and earthquake strengthening closing a number of CBD buildings.\nBaypark Stadium.\nBuilt in 2000, opened in 2001 and formerly known as Bluechip stadium and Western Bay Stadium, Baypark stadium is a multi-purpose stadium that the Bay of Plenty Steamers use as a home ground along with Rotorua International Stadium. It has a capacity of 19,800, which was almost attained when Bay of Plenty had the Ranfurly Shield run of 2004. Baypark was subsequently shunned in favour of Tauranga Domain due to the stadium's poor surface and the lack of proximity between the fans and the players due to the racing track circling the pitch.\nRotorua International Stadium.\nWith a capacity of 34,000, Rotorua International Stadium is one of the larger stadiums in New Zealand, but doesn't get the matches that will draw the crowds. It is one of the two stadiums that the Steamers use as a home field, with many considering it the home of Bay of Plenty Rugby. It is also known as \"The Hangi Pit\", because of the mud-pools around Rotorua.\nOther representative teams.\nIn addition to the Men's 1st XV, the BOPRU has a number of other representative teams for both Men and Women. BOPRU is part of the Women's Provincial Championship.\nClub Rugby.\nThe Bay of Plenty Rugby Union holds union-wide and sub-union competitions including the Kusabs Cup, the premier Bay of Plenty rugby trophy starting in 1912. It has 38 local clubs under affiliated with them and three sub-unions to be part of.\nThe Baywide competition runs for 20–21 weeks and split to four stages:\nThe 38 clubs are split into three sub-unions, the Central, Eastern and Western Sub-Unions.\nCentral.\nThere are ten clubs in the Central Bay of Plenty sub-union.\nEastern.\nThere are 14 clubs in the Eastern Bay of Plenty sub-union.\nWestern.\nThere are 13 clubs in the Western Bay of Plenty sub-union.\nStructure.\nStage One runs for 6–7 weeks, clubs are put into their respective sub-unions and complete a local competition. 24 teams are put into 2 sections with 2 groups of 6 in each section. Each teams faces the other teams in their group once with the Rugby Union Bonus Points System used to determine their placings.\nThe four top placed teams after a round-robin from each group in the top section go on to compete in the Baywide Premier competition for the Kusabs Cup. The two bottom placed teams each group of section 1 and the two top placed teams from the two groups of section 2 go on to compete in the first division. The remaining eight teams compete in the second division. And division three is made of teams from the local competitions.\nEach division goes through a round-robin where every team faces each other and the top four from each division goes on to the Bartercard Baywide Semi-finals and Finals Day.\nThe semi-finals and finals are played over two weeks and the Premier Division Champions win the Kusabs Cup.\nIn recent years the Tauranga Raptors have won the premier title in the Bay of Plenty four consecutive times 2007–10.\nBaywide List of Club Champions.\nThe Baywide Club Championship (rather than sub-union club championships) started in 1990, list of champions:\nAll Blacks.\nThis is a list of players who have represented New Zealand from the Bay of Plenty representative rugby union team. Players are listed by the decade they were first selected in and players in bold are current All Blacks."

        "title": "Larry Smith (American football coach)",
        "text": "Larry Dean Smith (September 12, 1939 – January 28, 2008) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at Tulane University (1976–1979), the University of Arizona (1980–1986), the University of Southern California (1987–1992), and the University of Missouri (1994–2000).\nIn Smith's 24 seasons as a head coach, his teams were 143–126–7.\nEarly life.\nSmith was a native of Van Wert, Ohio, where he was a three-sport star at Van Wert High School, graduating in 1957.\nHe earned an appointment to West Point, but transferred to Bowling Green State University a year later to pursue coaching. He played two-way end for the Falcons, playing on a small-college national championship team as a sophomore in 1959; he won all-league honors as a junior and was team captain as a senior. Smith graduated from Bowling Green in 1962 with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics, and later earned a Master of Education from Bowling Green in 1967.\nAssistant coach.\nKnown as a defense-oriented, no-nonsense coach, Smith began coaching as an assistant with Shawnee High School in Lima, Ohio for two seasons (1962–63) and then head coach the next three years (1964–66). In 1967, he joined Bo Schembechler's staff at Miami University, serving as defensive end coach for two seasons.\nHe moved with Schembechler to Michigan, serving as offensive line coach for four seasons (1969–72). When fellow assistant coach Jim Young (also a native of Van Wert, OH and high school football teammate) was hired as head coach at Arizona, Smith moved with him and served as the assistant head coach/defensive coordinator there for three years (1973–75).\nHead coaching career.\nTulane.\nAfter the departure of Bennie Ellender, Tulane hired Smith as the head coach in 1976. His first team went 2–9, then improved in 1977 to 3–8, and then 4–7 in 1978.\nSmith's Green Wave team experienced a break-out year in 1979: Tulane opened the season defeating #13 Stanford and later defeated #19 SMU. In the regular season finale, Tulane defeated rival LSU, 24–13, in the Louisiana Superdome; the crowd of 73,496 remains the highest attendance to see the Green Wave play at the Superdome. Tulane ended the regular season with a 9–2 record, ranked #15 and was invited to play in the 1979 Liberty Bowl, its first bowl game in six years.\nTulane lost to Penn State, 9–6, but Smith's ability to finish the season 9–3 attracted attention and he was hired away by Arizona.\nSmith's tenure with Tulane ended with a 17–27 record. Under his guidance, 10 Tulane players earned All-America honors, including two-time All-American quarterback Roch Hontas and kicker Eddie Murray, as well as offensive tackle Eric Laakso and tight end Rodney Holman. Six of his Tulane players entered the NFL.\nArizona.\nSmith arrived at Arizona in time for the 1980 season, the Wildcats' third season in the Pacific-10 Conference (along with rival Arizona State [ASU], they had joined the former Pacific-8 in 1978). Smith put great emphasis on in-state recruiting, built up the rivalry game with ASU, and focused the team on what he called \"running and hitting\". His first team went 5–6, including a 44–7 blowout loss to ASU; it would be his only losing season at Arizona. The highlight of the season was a 23-17 upset of 2nd-ranked UCLA (the Bruins were poised to become #1 as top ranked Alabama had lost earlier in the day).\nThe Wildcats improved to 6-5 during his second season, highlighted by a major 13–10 upset of #1 USC on the road.\nUnder Smith's leadership, the Wildcats became competitive in the conference, and also began dominating the rivalry with the Sun Devils. It culminated in consecutive bowl appearances: in the 1985 Sun Bowl, where a tie with Georgia gave the Wildcats an 8–3–1 record; and the 1986 Aloha Bowl, where a victory over North Carolina allowed the Wildcats to finish with a 9–3 record in his final season.\nSmith's tenure with the Wildcats ended with a 48–28–3 record. Seven Arizona players earned All-America honors during his tenure, including two-time consensus All-American linebacker Ricky Hunley and All-Americans linebacker Lamonte Hunley (Ricky's younger brother), Morris Trophy-winning center Joe Tofflemire, safety Allan Durden, placekicker Max Zendejas, linebacker Byron Evans, and safety Chuck Cecil. More than 20 of Smith's Wildcat players went on to play professionally.\nUSC.\nAfter success at Tulane and Arizona, Smith was hired as USC's first coach without previous Trojan ties since Howard Jones in 1925.\nHis tenure at USC started strong as his first three Trojans teams went 27–8–1, won a then-school-record 19 consecutive Pacific-10 Conference games, earned three consecutive conference titles from 1987 to 1989, and went to three consecutive Rose Bowls.\nSmith's 1988 team was arguably his most successful. With Rodney Peete at quarterback, the Trojans started their season 10–0, defeating #3-ranked Oklahoma and #6-ranked UCLA. USC's Rose Bowl berth-clinching win over UCLA that year was its first-ever against the Bruins in Pasadena since they moved to the Rose Bowl in 1982. Smith's USC team entered their final regular season game ranked #2 against the #1-ranked rival Notre Dame; the Fighting Irish defeated the Trojans, 27–10, en route to a national title. The Trojans went on to play in the Rose Bowl, losing to Michigan.\nHis 1989 team went 9–1–1 in the regular season and beat Michigan in the 1990 Rose Bowl, avenging the previous year's loss.\nSmith's next two Trojans teams were not as successful, losing the 1990 John Hancock Bowl (historically known as the Sun Bowl), followed by a difficult 3–8 1991 season that began with a major upset loss at home to unheralded Memphis State. The 1990 season was marked by a strained relationship with quarterback Todd Marinovich, culminating in a heated verbal barrage on Smith in full view of a national TV audience during the 1990 John Hancock Bowl loss, and Marinovich getting arrested for cocaine possession a month later. Marinovich soon left for the NFL after his sophomore year.\nAfter the 1990 season three players were arrested on charges of sexual assault (and later acquitted), and after spring practice there were the arrests and subsequent convictions of two players in a kidnapping-robbery spree. The 1991 season itself was only the third time the Trojans had had a losing season in over 30 years.\nThe 1992 season proved to be Smith's undoing with USC. The Trojans had a disappointing 6–4–1 regular season that included a 31–31 tie with San Diego State (a game in which the Aztecs' Marshall Faulk shredded the USC defense for over 250 yards), a 31–23 loss to intersectional rival Notre Dame, and a gut-wrenching 38–37 loss to archrival UCLA. The then #23-ranked Trojans accepted a berth in the 1992 Freedom Bowl, a lower tier bowl game in Anaheim, California, against an unranked Fresno State team in the first match between the two programs. Despite being heavy underdogs, the Trent Dilfer-led Bulldogs won in a 24–7 upset victory that angered many USC supporters.\nSmith caused further furor after the game in declaring: \"Names and logos don't mean anything. You don't beat someone just because of your name and logo.\" Within days of the Freedom Bowl loss and his commentary, Smith was fired by USC with three years left on his contract.\nSmith finished with a 44–25–3 record at USC, 17–17–2 in his final three seasons. During his tenure he coached 13 All-American first teamers, including Heisman Trophy runner-up Rodney Peete, Thorpe Award-winning safety Mark Carrier, linebacker Junior Seau, wide receiver Curtis Conway and defensive tackle Tim Ryan. In all, 33 USC players under Smith were selected in the NFL Draft, including six in the first round.\nMissouri.\nAfter a year away from coaching, Smith was hired before the 1994 season as the 30th head coach of Missouri, replacing Bob Stull, who had been reassigned as assistant athletic director after five losing seasons. His first two Tigers squads went 3–8–1 and 3–8; however, they improved to 5–6 in 1996. The 1997 Tigers finished with a 7–4 regular-season record, Mizzou's first winning season since 1983. The Tigers even came within a controversial kicked reception of defeating eventual national champion Nebraska at home that season. Mizzou was invited to the 1997 Holiday Bowl, where they were defeated by Colorado State, 35–24.\nThe Tigers had another 7–4 regular season in 1998, and were able to cap it with a win in the 1998 Insight.com Bowl against West Virginia, 34–31, to end the season 8–4 and ranked #21 in the final AP Poll.\nThe 1997–98 seasons marked Mizzou's first back-to-back bowl games since 1980-81 under Warren Powers' tenure. Smith was rewarded at the end of the 1998 regular season with a new five-year contract that raised his salary from $161,500 to $180,000 annually; he had become one of just four coaches in NCAA history to take four schools to bowl games.\nThe Tigers followed their two bowl seasons with two losing seasons that featured a number of blowout losses. The 1999 squad went 4–7, gave up a 21–0 shut-out loss to rival Kansas, and ended the season with three straight blow-out defeats of 37–0 to Oklahoma, 51–14 to Texas A&amp;M and 66–0 to Kansas State. Smith's 2000 Tigers did not fare better, losing to Clemson (62–9), Texas (47–12) and rival Kansas (38–17) on their way to a 3–8 season. Smith was fired on November 18, 2000, immediately after the final game of the season, a 28–24 loss to Kansas State. During his tenure at Missouri, the team compiled a 33–46–1 record.\nLater years.\nAfter his coaching career ended, Smith moved back to Tucson and worked as a commentator for Arizona football games on Fox Sports Net, and organized weekend instructional camps twice annually. He also voted in the Harris Poll, part of the Bowl Championship Series equation. He was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 1999, which would ultimately claim his life. He died in Tucson on January 28, 2008.\nSmith was married to Cheryl (née Nueenschwander); they had a son, Corby, a daughter, Alicia, and several grandchildren. Corby Smith played at quarterback for both USC and Iowa, graduating from the latter in 1995 and immediately joining his father on the coaching staff of Missouri."

        "text": "The 2002 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2001–02 UEFA Champions League, Europe's primary club football competition. The show-piece event was contested between Bayer Leverkusen of Germany and Real Madrid of Spain at Hampden Park in Glasgow, Scotland on 15 May 2002 to decide the winner of the Champions League. Leverkusen appeared in the final for the first time, whereas Real Madrid appeared in their 12th final.\nEach club needed to progress through two group stages, and two knockout rounds to reach the final. Real Madrid won their group and moved into the second group stage, which they also won, before facing the defending champions Bayern Munich and Barcelona in the knockout stage. Bayer Leverkusen finished second in their group behind Barcelona and progressed to the second group stage. There, they won their group, before beating the likes of Liverpool and Manchester United to progress to the final.\nBefore the match, a minute of silence was held in honour of Ukrainian manager Valeriy Lobanovskyi, who died two days earlier.\nReal Madrid were regarded as favourites before the match and took the lead in the eighth minute through Raúl. Lúcio equalised five minutes later, before Zinedine Zidane scored the winning goal on the stroke of half-time, a left-footed volley into the top corner that has since gone down as one of the greatest goals in the history of the competition, to secure Real Madrid's ninth European Cup.\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nPost match.\nIn the 2001–02 season, Bayer Leverkusen finished second in the Bundesliga and lost in the 2002 DFB-Pokal Final. After the match, Leverkusen manager Klaus Toppmöller expressed his disappointment on finishing this strong season without a title, stating: \"the disappointment is huge – you don't always get the rewards you deserve in football, and no-one knows that better than us after what we have been through. We must seek consolation. Doing what we have done means we have had a very good season – but what has happened to us is difficult and makes us feel bitter.\"\nFive Leverkusen players, Michael Ballack, Hans-Jörg Butt, Oliver Neuville, Carsten Ramelow, and Bernd Schneider went on to add a fourth silver medal at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. However, the gold medal-winning Brazil squad also included a Leverkusen player in Lúcio."

        "text": "Pat McMahon (born May 28, 1953) is an American former college and professional baseball coach who currently works in the New York Yankees' organization.\nEarly life.\nMcMahon grew up in Jacksonville, Florida and attended Bishop Kenny High School. During High School he earned nine varsity letters in, baseball, basketball, and football. As a senior, he was named earning all-state baseball. He was selected in the 18th round of the 1971 Major League Baseball draft by the New York Mets. Rather than sign with the Mets McMahon elected to play college baseball at Saint John's River Community College in Palatka, Florida, for two seasons. After finishing his JUCO career he played at Stetson University from 1974–1975. He graduated with a physical education degree and spent a year as a student assistant coach with the Hatters in 1976.\nEarly coaching career.\nMcMahon's first coaching job after leaving college was as the head coach at Bishop Kenney High School from 1977–1980. From there he went on to server stints as an assistant coach at Mississippi State from 1980–1981, Old Dominion University from 1981–1982, and MSU again from 1983–1989.\nOld Dominion.\nHe was the head coach at Old Dominion from 1990–94. During his time at ODU he led The Monarchs to an overall record of 189–86 along with 2 NCAA Regional appearances and a 1994 Colonial Athletic Association championship. McMahon left ODU in 1994 to become Associate Head Coach at Mississippi State\nMississippi State University.\nMcMahon returned to Mississippi State in 1994 to serve as Associate Head Coach under legendary MSU Head Coach Ron Polk with the understanding that he would become the head coach when Polk retired. Polk had essentially picked McMahon as his successor. Following the MSU's appearance in the 1997 College World Series, Ron Polk retired and McMahon took over as head coach. The McMahon era got off to a fast start at MSU as he led the Diamond Dogs back to the College World Series, marking the first time that MSU had made back to back appearances in Omaha. McMahon's spent a total of four years as head coach at MSU where his teams compiled an overall record of 164–88 and surpassed the 40 win mark 3 times. In 2001, he led MSU to the SEC Tournament championship. In total under McMahon MSU appeared in 4 NCAA Regionals, and 2 NCAA Super Regionals to go along with their 1998 College World Series appearance. McMahon left MSU following the 2001 season to become the Head coach at the University of Florida. He was replaced at MSU by the very man that he had replaced four years earlier, Ron Polk.\nUniversity of Florida.\nFollowing his time at MSU, McMahon returned to his home state of Florida in 2001 to take over as the skipper of the Gator baseball program following the dismissal of Andy Lopez McMahon spent a total of six season as the Gators' Head Coach (2002–2007). Under his leadership UF compiled a record of 202–113 while making 4 NCAA Regional appearances, 2 Super Regional appearances, and 1 College World Series appearance to go along with winning the 2005 SEC Championship. \nOn June 7, 2007, the University of Florida announced that McMahon had been fired following back to back seasons where the Gators finished 28–28 and 29–30 respectively.\nUSA Baseball.\nCoach McMahon has also spent time as a member of the coaching staff for USA Baseball including serving as Assistant Coach in 1991, Pitching Coach in 1997, and Head Coach in 2001.\nProfessional coaching career.\nOn September 29, 2007, Baby-Bombers.com reported that McMahon had accepted a position with the New York Yankees. in 2008 he was named the Manager of the Staten Island Yankees,(the New York Yankees' Short-Season A affiliate) who play in the New York–Penn League. He spent one season as the manager of the Staten Island club leading them to a 49–26 record and a first-place finish. He also managed the New York-Penn American League All-Star team.\nDuring his stint as manager of the Staten Island Yankees McMahon was involved in the game that led to the creation of the Venditte Rule. Pat Venditte, at that time a member of the Staten Island ball club, is best known for being an ambidextrous pitcher or a \"switch-pitcher\". On June 19, 2008, in a game against the Brooklyn Cyclones, Venditte pitched a scoreless ninth inning for a Yankees win. Before Venditte faced the last Cyclone batter, Ralph Henriquez, a switch-hitter, upon choosing to bat left- or right-handed (with Venditte subsequently choosing to pitch with the same hand), Henriquez would then go to the other side of the plate (and adjust his shin guard—which is worn on the front leg when a batter takes his stance) to regain the advantage. After this had happened several times the teams appealed to the umpiring crew, which ruled that the batter must first select from which side of the plate he intended to hit, and that the pitcher would then be allowed to declare with which arm he would pitch (the Venditte Rule, adopted several weeks later by the umpires' association, would make the opposite determination and preserve the traditional right of a switch-hitter to choose an opposite-handed match-up). Venditte subsequently struck out Henriquez to end the game. A film of the incident received notoriety on the Internet and the tale was recounted in a number of places, including within the baseball compendium \"Rollie's Follies\".\nPost coaching career.\nMcMahon currently works as the New York Yankees' International Player Development Coordinator and was named the 2016 named Lefty Gomez Award winner by the American Baseball Coaches Association. On July 18, 2017 The American Baseball Coaches Association announced that he had been selected for induction into the ABCA Hall of Fame during their convention on January 5, 2018 in Indianapolis, Indiana.\nAwards and honors.\nIn his twelve seasons as a college head coach, McMahon compiled a career record of 527–259–1, appeared in two College World Series, made four Super Regional appearances, put together eight 40-win seasons, and 13 30-win seasons. He received seven Coach of the Year awards. \nPersonal.\nHe is married to the former Cheri Wells of Jacksonville and the couple are the parents of two children; a daughter, Logan, and a son, J. Wells. McMahon is the oldest of Jack and Pat McMahon's eight children.\nExternal links.\nCategoryBaseball players from Jacksonville, Florida"

Meanwhile, the Maroons finished the NHL regular season in second place. Montreal went on to beat the third seed Pittsburgh Pirates and then defeated the first place Ottawa Senators 2–1 in a two-game total goals series, thus capturing the Prince of Wales Trophy and the right to play Victoria for the Cup.\nGame summaries.\nAll of the games in the 1926 Cup Finals were played at the Montreal Forum. Aided by three future Hockey Hall of Famers, the Maroons ended up dominating the series. Goaltender Clint Benedict, who previously helped Ottawa in three Cup championships, recorded three shutouts. Rookie Nels Stewart scored 6 of Montreal's 10 overall goals in the 4 games. Punch Broadbent also recorded a goal for the Maroons.

The game features Steve Carell as the announcer.\nGameplay.\nThe game follows the normal rules of volleyball and a standard game with standard rules can be played. However, there are a number of different modes that mix up the standard formula. One example is Hot Potato, where the ball is played as a timer ticks down, and once it runs out the ball explodes upon impact of the nearest player. Another is \"Casino Round\", where the longer the rally, the more money the scoring team on that play gets. Individual settings can also be altered within these modes, such as adjusting whether only the serving team can score a point (\"side out\" rule) or any team who wins the rally gets a point.\nFighting with other characters in an option before a serve where a player can choose to fight an opponent on the other side of the net. If the player wins they earn the victim's momentum bar. Beating tokens are earned after great plays and a turnover of the serve.\n\"Outlaw Volleyball Red Hot\".\nReleased as a rental-only exclusive for Blockbuster, and meant to serve as a side game to the original rather than a full-fledged sequel. The game is set in Hell and contains only one court, the \"Pit of Hell\", which was not in the original Outlaw Volleyball. Returning characters also had slight outfit variants to reflect the setting, like red horns and devil wings. The game can now be found at many used game retailers.\nReception.\nReviews ranged from positive to very mixed. GameRankings and Metacritic gave \"Outlaw Volleyball\" a score of 79% and 77 out of 100, and also gave \"Outlaw Volleyball Remixed\" a score of 64% and 57 out of 100."

The stage end location was Carcassonne and in between those cities the course featured four categorized climbs:\nThere were also two intermediate sprints in Caumont (at 76.0 km/47.2 miles) and Mirepoix (162.0 km/100.7 miles).\nThis being the first stage after the Pyrenees, many riders were hoping to get an easy day, sitting at the back of the peloton; however, there were also a lot of riders who had lost a lot of time during those mountain stages and who knew that they were not going to get a good position in the general standings. Those riders all tried to get into the escape group which led to everyone chasing everyone for the first 100 kilometers and an extremely fast pace which caused the first riders already passing the 46-kilometre mark after just one hour. As a result, 4 riders dropped from the race during the first hour; among those were Paolo Savoldelli and Benjamín Noval from and the sprinter Isaac Gálvez. Another important fact for the large number of riders trying to escape was the fact that it was 14 July, in France known as Bastille Day. On this day the French are extra motivated as it is their national holiday, which shows in the results of the latest years with David Moncoutié winning in 2005 and Richard Virenque in 2004 on this day.\nSo a lot of changing situations during the first hours of this race, as there was always some team not happy with the current group of escapees. On the first climb of the day the first serious group formed, consisting of 15 riders:\nThis group looked to be getting away from the peloton at first, but suddenly started working for Robbie McEwen as sprinters Bennati and Hushovd were in this group. They were working hard to keep the gap between the peloton and the group reasonable, but of course the leaders tried to stay ahead too. This led to the gap fluctuating between 45\" and 1'15\" for a very long time. From this group which formed after about 30 kilometres, six riders dropped as they waited for the peloton after 70 kilometres, knowing that they would not let the group go. Meanwhile, Albasini, Bennati, Goubert, Guerini, Hincapie, Millar, Moncoutié, Verdugo and Voigt pushed on. Bennati then won the intermediate sprint and stopped working, but now the teams from and Team Milram were trying to close the gap as they did not have any riders up front. Finally they succeeded at kilometre 94. As soon as the breakaway group was caught, a new group formed which now consisted of only four riders:\nRobbie McEwen was not happy again with Óscar Freire among this group, but when he tried to start up the chase again, almost the whole peloton was mad at him as they had been now riding at a huge pace for over 100 kilometres, just one day after a heavy mountain stage. It took him a few kilometres to settle down and give in and so the group did get away. was now maintaining a moderate pace just to keep the riders within a reasonable distance but without wasting too much energy. Most riders were happy to catch a break and at that time it was almost sure one of the 4 leaders was going to win the stage.\nLooking at the leading group, it was reasonable to think that Ballan, Le Mével or Popovych was going to attack sooner or later, as Freire is a top-class sprinter and would probably beat them all if they went to the finish line together. Yaroslav Popovych was the first to attack and immediately the French got disappointed as Christophe Le Mével dropped and never managed to come back. Alessandro Ballan however closed the gap and brought Óscar Freire back in his wheel. It was then Freire's turn to attack, but again Ballan closed the gap and now brought back Popovych. Popovych and Freire both took turns in attacking but Ballan seemed to be the strongest as he closed the gap every time. However, after a while he was also getting tired and could not respond to yet another attack by Popovych. He did not get any help from Freire in closing the gap and so Popovych won the stage. Freire knew he did not deserve the second place and left it to Ballan; however, this could cost him the green jersey in the end. Le Mével finished as fourth and in the peloton it was Tom Boonen who convincingly won the sprint for the fifth place, 4'25\" behind Popovych.\nAs a result of this stage Floyd Landis remains in yellow and Yaroslav Popovych just moved into the top 10 at place 10. Robbie McEwen still holds a considerable lead of 25 points over Óscar Freire in the standings for the green jersey but sees Freire come 11 points closer, Daniele Bennati 3 points and Tom Boonen 1 point. Michael Rasmussen scored 12 points today for the polka dot jersey, but is still 19 points behind David de la Fuente. Markus Fothen stays the best rider under 23 and also in the team standings nothing changes, keeps a small lead over . Next to the earlier mentioned quitters, today Agritubel also loses two riders who give up — José Alberto Martínez and Samuel Plouhinec. Daniele Bennati, who was not amongst the escaped riders but was almost constantly in the offense during the first 100 kilometres, received the combativity trophy for the day.\nStage 13.\n15 July 2006 — Béziers to Montélimar, \nThis stage had five categorized climbs, all Category 4. It started at Béziers and ended at Montélimar.\nThis stage was characterized by an early attack including six riders — Voigt, Pereiro, Chavanel, Coyot, Quinziato, and Grivko, who attacked about 20 km into the race. As Cofidis had two riders in the lead group, Chavanel and Coyot, they decided to have Coyot wait for the peloton.\nThe main peloton, including Floyd Landis, did not see anyone in this group as a threat, so they allowed them to get away and stay away. The attack group of five had a lead of 30 seconds at 27 km. They continued to increase their lead—to 3 minutes at 37 km, 6'20\" at 47.5 km, and 11'05\" at 61.5 km after the category-4 Cóte de Puéchabon climb. At the beginning of the third climb, the Cóte de L'Arbousset at 119.5 km, the lead was 18'50\". The lead grew to 24'45\" at the 146.5 mark, and to 27'10\" at 172.5 km. Pereiro had begun the stage 28'50\" behind Landis. Now he was threatening Landis's yellow.\nBut this was intentional, because the previous mountain stages had shown that from Landis's teammates, only Axel Merckx was somewhat able to stay with Landis and help him. Through losing the yellow jersey, the team made sure that those teammates did not have to ride after the escaped riders every day; instead they now leave that responsibility to Pereiro's team, .\nOn the final climb, the Cóte de Villeneuve de Berg, youngster Grivko attacked. Just like most times, the first attacker is not the winning rider, as the group was able to catch and pass him. Grivko never managed to return and finished fifth. In the final five kilometres, Voigt and Pereiro broke away from Chavanel and Quinziato, who were both expecting the other to close the gap. Neither of them did, and the other two maintained their lead the rest of the way. In the final hundred meters, Pereiro was on Voigt's rear wheel, angling to pass him at the finish. Voigt held him off and barely won the stage.\nIn the peloton, the teammates of Menchov from Rabobank started increasing the pace, as they wanted Landis to remain in yellow to have his teammates work hard the next few days. After a few kilometres, however, they gave up and so the peloton finished 29'57\" behind Voigt. Pereiro was rewarded for ending second and earned the yellow—one minute, 29 seconds ahead of Landis. The peloton came in past the time limit of 29'00\", but since more than 20% of all riders were involved, they were allowed to stay in the race. Apart from the team standing, where Team CSC took the lead, all other jerseys remained with their rider, as the breakaway group had taken most points of the climbs and sprints.\nStage 14.\n16 July 2006 — Montélimar to Gap \nThis stage had four categorized climbs— two Category 3, and two Category 2. It started at Montélimar and ended at Gap.\nThe categorized climbs were as follows:\nThere were also two intermediate sprints in La Bonté (at 50.0 km) and La Plaine (at 160.5 km).\nAfter 39 kilometres, five riders broke away — Egoi Martínez, Matthias Kessler, Pierrick Fédrigo, Mario Aerts and Salvatore Commesso. Rik Verbrugghe and David Cañada joined the group later on, while Martinez dropped out.\nWith 39 kilometres to go, Verbrugghe, Kessler and Cañada were involved in a crash at downhill right-hander. Verbrugghe and Cañada were injured and had to abandon the race. Kessler could continue but was soon caught by the peloton. Of the remaining three riders, Aerts was dropped and caught by a peloton. The peloton was not able to catch Fédrigo and Commesso who had a sprint for a stage victory, with the Frenchman taking the glory. Christian Vande Velde attacked from the peloton late to get third place. Óscar Pereiro finished 26th and retained the yellow jersey.\nRest day 2.\n17 July 2006 — Gap\nStage 15.\n18 July 2006 — Gap to L'Alpe-d'Huez, \nThis was a mountain stage with three categorized climbs: the Col d'Izoard (Highest Level) with an ascent of 7% over 14.5 km, the Col du Lautaret (Category 2) with an ascent of 4.4% over 12.1 km and Alpe d'Huez (Highest Level) with an ascent of 7.9% over 13.8 km. It started at Gap at 785 m and ended at L'Alpe-d'Huez at 1850 m.\nAlpe d'Huez is one of the famous climbs that often figures on the Tour de France. Although Fränk Schleck from Luxembourg won the stage, American Floyd Landis' fourth-place finish was enough to regain the yellow jersey.\nStage 16.\n19 July 2006 — Bourg-d'Oisans to La Toussuire, \nThis was a mountain stage with four categorized climbs: the Col du Galibier (Hors catégorie) with a 4.5% ascent over 42.8 km, the Col de la Croix-de-Fer (Hors catégorie) with a 6.9% ascent over 22.7 km, the Col du Mollard (Category 2) with a 6.8% ascent over 5.8 km, and La Toussuire (Category 1) with an ascent of 6% over 18.4 km. It began at Bourg-d'Oisans and ended at La Toussuire.\nThe Dane, Michael Rasmussen won the stage, and Spaniard Óscar Pereiro came in third, retaking the yellow jersey from American Floyd Landis, who came in 23rd on the day dropping to 11th overall.\nItalian Daniele Bennati of the Lampre team was injured in a fall and unable to continue the race. French rider Sylvain Chavanel fell in the same descent, but continued after being examined.\nStage 17.\n20 July 2006 — St.-Jean-de-Maurienne to Morzine, \nThis was a mountain stage with five categorized climbs: the Col des Saisies (Category 1) with an ascent of 6.4% over 14.9 km, the Col des Aravis (Category 2) with an ascent of 7.7% over 5.9 km, the Col de la Colombière (Category 1) with an ascent of 5% over 11.8 km, the Côte de Châtillon (Category 3) with an ascent of 4.9% over 5.1 km, and the Col de Joux-Plane (Highest Level) with an ascent of 8.7% over 11.7 km. It started at St.-Jean-de-Maurienne and ended at Morzine-Avoriaz.\nAmerican Floyd Landis put himself back in contention by winning the stage after a 120 km solo breakaway attack, advancing to third place overall. Spaniard Óscar Pereiro finished the stage in seventh place and now leads Carlos Sastre by only 12 seconds.\nAs is the case with all stage winners, Landis was tested as part of the Tour's standard doping precautions. On 27 July 2006, one week after the stage finished, the announced that the \"A\" test on Landis's urine sample had come back \"positive\" for banned synthetic testosterone as well as a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone nearly three times the limit allowed by World Anti-Doping Agency rules. On 5 August 2006, the \"B\" test confirmed the initial findings and Landis was immediately dismissed by the Phonak team. In June 2008, the International Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed Landis's appeal, disqualifying him from the 2006 Tour de France, and so stripping him of his win and suspending him from the sport for two years.\nStage 18.\n21 July 2006 — Morzine to Mâcon, \nThis stage had three categorized climbs: the Côte de Châtillon-en-Michaille (Category 3) with an ascent of 3.7% over 51. km, the Col du Berthiand (Category 2) with an ascent of 6% over 4.7 km, and the Côte de Chambod (Category 4) with an ascent of 6.4 over 1.9 km. It started at Morzine and ended at Mâcon.\nThe Italian Matteo Tosatto gave the team their first stage victory, after team leader Tom Boonen dropped out of the Tour in the Alps. Tosatto's compatriot Cristian Moreni took second, while the yellow-jersey wearer Óscar Pereiro coasted along with American Floyd Landis on his tail.\nStage 19.\n22 July 2006 — Le Creusot to Montceau-les-Mines, (ITT)\nThis was the last time trial of the 2006 Tour de France.\nAmerican Floyd Landis put all his rivals behind him in this stage and virtually sealed an unprecedented come-from-behind victory.\nStage 20.\n23 July 2006 — Sceaux to Paris, \nThe last stage had two categorized climbs (both Category 4). It started at Sceaux-Antony and ended at Paris on the Champs-Élysées.\nAs expected after the time trials on Saturday, American Floyd Landis won the 2006 Tour de France, before it was taken away due to doping and handed to eventual winner Óscar Pereiro. Norwegian Thor Hushovd won the stage, edging out Australian sprint champion (and points winner) Robbie McEwen in the dash for the line. This makes Hushovd the first rider to win the first and last stage of the Tour de France in the same year since Bernard Hinault in 1982."

        "text": "Bryce Gibbs (born 5 November 1984 in Camden, New South Wales) is an Australian professional rugby league footballer currently playing for the Appin Dogs in the Group 6 Rugby League. He previously played for the Wests Tigers with whom he won the 2005 NRL Premiership, and for the Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks of the National Rugby League (NRL). He has been called, \"a passionate clubman, popular among teammates and a front-rower with good line-speed and a willingness to get his hands dirty.\"\nBackground.\nBorn in Camden, New South Wales, Gibbs played junior football with the Leumeah Wolves and Macquarie Fields Hawks before being signed by the Wests Tigers.\nPlaying career.\nWests Tigers.\nGibbs made his NRL debut against Penrith in August 2003, scoring a try with his first touch of the ball. \"I came off the bench for the Tigers against Penrith at Penrith. I got the ball and scored and thought 'how good’s this',\" Gibbs later said.\nIn 2004 Gibbs was suspended for five matches following an incident in which he made contact with Brisbane Broncos five-eighth Casey McGuire.\nGibbs scored a try in the Wests Tigers' victory in the 2005 NRL Grand Final, but never scored another for the club. As NRL Premiers Wests faced Super League champions Bradford Bulls in the 2006 World Club Challenge. Gibbs played from the interchange bench in the Tigers' 30–10 loss.\nIn 2008, Gibbs won the award for being the Wests Tigers' Best Defensive Player.\nA fractured kneecap saw Gibbs playing injured throughout the semis in 2010. He was unable to play in the early rounds of the next season. Around the same time, he signed a contract to remain with the Wests Tigers until the end of the 2014 season. However, by the middle of 2011, Wests Tigers had released Gibbs in order to make room for Adam Blair, and he signed a three-year contract with the Cronulla Sharks from the start of 2012.\nGibbs later said of his release, \"I found out they didn't want me when I picked up the paper. The paper report said the club was punting me, Liam Fulton and Chris Heighington, but I didn't know what was going on. I can remember walking into the weights room and all the boys started laughing and saying, 'You are gone.' It wasn't a joke though because it was true. It was pretty embarrassing and devastating.\"\nBy the time Gibbs left the Wests Tigers, he had been a regular in the starting team for a number of years, and was one of the club's most experienced players, having played in 155 games. He was noted for his, \"determination in defence.\" Former teammate Keith Galloway said of him, \"I learnt so much from Bryce in terms of coming off the line in defence. He used to always shout at you if you were not pulling your weight\".\nCronulla-Sutherland Sharks.\nWith new club Cronulla having a good start to 2012, and old club Wests Tigers a poor one, Gibbs was described by Ben Ross as, \"the glue to any team he’ll be in. He gets the boys together and we have a lot of fun around him and he makes us more of a team than people would really see.\" After missing some early games due to injury, Gibbs was chosen to play for City Origin.\nMidway through 2012, having yet to score since the 2005 Grand Final, Gibbs declared he would not cut his hair until he had another try. He said, \"my kids have actually never even seen me score. I’ve got a couple at training but that’s about it. I’ll get one this year. I’m not going to get my hair cut until I do.\"\nGibbs did not appear for the Sharks until round 17 of 2013 season due to an injury when he put his foot through a glass door, resulting in 30 stitches and damage to his Achilles tendon. \nHe said, \"I was going to try and stitch it myself. The missus was filthy, there was blood everywhere. It looked like a murder scene. I tried to sleep it off but it was a bit painful and throbbing.\"\nAs of the start of the 2013 season, Gibbs had played 134 games without scoring a try, the most of any player who had scored at least one try in his first grade career. In Round 26 against the Canberra Raiders at Canberra Stadium in the Sharks 38–18 win, Gibbs scored a try, 142 matches since his last.\nOn 13 November 2014 Gibbs announced his retirement from rugby league after 12 years and just under 200 NRL games."

        "text": "The 1959 Tour de France was the 46th edition of the Tour de France, taking place between 25 June and 18 July. The race featured 120 riders, of which 65 finished. The Tour included 22 stages over .\nThe race was won by Spanish cyclist Federico Bahamontes, who also won the mountains classification. The points classification was won by French sprinter André Darrigade. The Belgian team became the winner of the team classification.\nAlthough the French national team had the favourites, the race was contested between Anglade, in a French regional team, and Bahamontes, in the Spanish national team. After the French national team refused to help Anglade, Bahamontes won the race. It was the first win by a Spanish cyclist.\nTeams.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nThe French team included Jacques Anquetil, Louison Bobet, Raphael Géminiani and Roger Riviere, who were all considered possible Tour winners. This also posed a problem, as they did all want to be team captain, and refused to work for each other.\nThe Spanish team was headed by Federico Bahamontes, who in previous years did not care for flat stages and time trials, and only tried to win the mountains classification. In the 1959 season, Bahamontes had Fausto Coppi as manager, and Coppi convinced Bahamontes to focus on the general classification.\nThe defending champion Charly Gaul was again placed in a mixed team of Luxembourgian and Dutch cyclists, and expected little support. The Italian team did not include Vito Favero and Gastone Nencini, who had performed well in the 1958 Tour. Their team captain was Ercole Baldini, winner of the 1958 Giro d'Italia, but he was not expected to be able to compete against Gaul, Bahamontes and Anquetil.\nOf the cyclists in the French regional teams, Henri Anglade was the most notable. He was included in the Centre-Midi team.\nThe cyclists were represented by agents, who negotiated for the prices in post-tour criteriums. There were two major agents: Daniel Dousset, who represented Anquetil, Rivière and Bahamontes, and Piel Poulidor, who represented Anglade. This made it more important for Anquetil to help Bahamontes than Anglade.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1959 Tour de France started on 25 June in Mulhouse, and had two rest days, in Bayonne and Saint-Étienne. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col de l'Iseran mountain pass on stage 18.\nRace overview.\nDuring the Tour, a package of strychnine, addressed to one of the teams, was intercepted by the Tour doctor.\nLike in the previous years, Darrigade won the first stage.\nIn the third stage, a group of 13 cyclists escaped, none of them considered favourites for the overall victory. The favourites let them escape, knowing that they would win enough time back in the mountains, and the group won more than 10 minutes on the rest. Robert Cazala from the French national team became the new leader.\nAnglade was riding well in the first stages. Because of an escape in stage 7, he gained a few minutes on the top favourites.\nIn the ninth stage, the Belgian cyclists broke away, and the French team followed them. Cazala was not able to follow them, and he lost the lead. Eddy Pauwels became the new leader\nPauwels lost the lead in the tenth stage, and regional Michel Vermeulin became the new leader.\nAfter stage 12, Anglade was in fifth place in the general classification, the first of the favourites for the overall victory. In the thirteenth stage, Anglade attacked and won the stage. He jumped to second place in the general classification.\nThe French team director then concentrated the strategy on beating Anglade, because he thought Anglade was the main threat.\nThe fifteenth stage was an individual mountain time trial, won by Spaniard Bahamontes. Bahamontes climbed to the second place in the general classification, only 4 seconds behind Jos Hoevenaers, the last man from the escaped group in stage 3 to stay high in the general classification. Eddy Pauwels was in third place, while Anglade was still in fourth place, only 43 seconds behind Hoevenaers.\nIn the sixteenth stage, Pauwels was in the escaped group, and won enough time to take over the lead in the general classification.\nIn the seventeenth stage, Bahamontes and Gaul escaped. Gaul won the stage, but Bahamontes took the leading position.\nThe eighteenth stage would determine the outcome of the race. Bahamontes was leading, but his teammates had used a lot of energy the day before. The French national team was expected to attack. In the eighteenth stage, Gaul was the first one to attack, and reached the top of the Galibier first, but later the other riders got back to him. On the way down from the Iseran, Bahamontes and Gaul were left behind, and Anquetil and Rivière were expected to increase their efforts, such that Bahamontes and Gaul would not be able to get back to them. Anquetil and Rivière did not want to assist each other and did nothing, so Bahamontes and Gaul were able to get back. Anquetil and Rivière then were left behind. On the last climb, Anglade attacked. Baldini and Gaul could follow, but Bahamontes could not, and at some moment was five minutes behind. This made Anglade the virtual race leader, which was against the wishes of the national team. Anquetil and Rivière then reached Bahamontes, and helped him to get back to Anglade.\nThe only risk for Bahamontes left was the time trial in stage 21. At the start, Bahamontes was leading by 5'40\". In the time trial, Anglade won 1'39\" back on Bahamontes, but that was not enough. When the Tour ended in the Parc des Princes velodrome in Paris, the French crowd booed the French national team, because they did not allow Anglade the victory.\nClassification leadership and awards.\nThe time that each cyclist required to finish each stage was recorded, and these times were added together for the general classification. If a cyclist had received a time bonus, it was subtracted from this total; all time penalties were added to this total. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey.\nThe points classification was calculated differently than in the years before. The winner of a stage received 100 points,\ndown to 1 point for the 25th cyclist. André Darrigade took the lead by winning the first stage, and remained the leader for the rest of the race.\nThe mountains classification was calculated by adding the points given to cyclists for reaching the highest point in a climb first.\nThe team classification was calculated as the sum of the daily team classifications, and the daily team classification was calculated by adding the times in the stage result of the best three cyclists per team. It was won by the Belgian team.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the cyclist considered most combative. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Gérard Saint won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given to the first rider to pass the memorial to Tour founder Henri Desgrange near the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 18. This prize was won by Charly Gaul."

Since high school, his most famous dunk has been the between-the-legs dunk, with many variations. He is also known for his ability to jump from the free throw line and dunk a basketball with both hands. 'Flight' White was a runner-up in two notable dunk contests: behind future University of Florida and Golden State Warriors power forward David Lee in the 2001 McDonald's High School Slam Dunk Contest, and behind North Carolina's David Noel in the NCAA College Slam Dunk Contest during the 2006 Final Four weekend.\nCollege career.\nWhite played his freshman year at the University of Florida in the 2001–02 season helping the Gators to a 22–9 record. He saw action in all but two games, making a pair of starts and averaged 20.5 minutes of playing time.

It was renamed Rugby Africa in December 2014.\nThe President of Rugby Africa is the Herbert Mensah from Ghana.\nHistory.\nThe Confederation of African Rugby (French: \"Confédération Africaine de Rugby\") was officially launched in January 1986 in Tunis. The inaugural members at the meeting were Ivory Coast, Kenya, Madagascar, Morocco, Senegal, the Seychelles, Tanzania and Tunisia. A meeting was held in July 1992 in Casablanca with the view of integrating the SARFU into the confederation. South Africa had been denied entry until this time because of the government policy of apartheid (South African rugby had been governed by the mainly white South African Rugby Board and the mainly black South African Rugby Union). In March 1992 these were formally combined to form the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU). The Confederation now has 37 member nations.\nAfrican Rugby Charter.\nThe \"African Rugby Charter\" was signed by the President of CAR, Abdelaziz Bougja, the then President of the South African Rugby Union (SARFU) Brian van Rooyen, in the presence of former South African president Nelson Mandela, and the South African Minister of Sport, Makhenkesi Stofile.\nMembers.\nWorld Rugby full members who are part of Rugby Africa:\nWorld Rugby associate members who are part of Rugby Africa:\nWorld Rugby non-members who are part of Rugby Africa (full or affiliate member):\nWorld Rugby suspended members who are part of Rugby Africa:\nNon-member countries working with the governing body (Rugby Africa non-members too):\nDefunct African National Rugby Union Teams\nCompetitions.\nTournaments run by Rugby Africa include:\nDevelopment programs.\nThe CAR formed agreements in 2014 which allowed member unions from Anglophone and Francophone nations in Africa to access training programs within the sports academies and administrative headquarters of the South African Rugby Union and French Rugby Federation, respectively. These agreements, designed to foster rugby development across the continent, were signed in January 2015, and followed earlier arrangements with the SARU and French club Castres Olympique which were made in 2006.\nLeopards.\nThe African Leopards are a representative team from Africa which aims to promote the sport throughout the whole of Africa.

        "title": "Doubleheader (baseball)",
        "text": "In the sport of baseball, a doubleheader is a set of two games played between the same two teams on the same day. Historically, doubleheaders have been played in immediate succession, in front of the same crowd. Contemporarily, the term is also used to refer to two games played between two teams in a single day in front of different crowds and not in immediate succession.\nThe record for the most doubleheaders played by a major-league team in one season is 44 by the Chicago White Sox in . Between September 4 and September 15, 1928, the Boston Braves played nine consecutive doubleheaders – 18 games in 12 days.\nHistory.\nFor many decades, major-league doubleheaders were routinely scheduled numerous times each season. However, any major-league doubleheader now played is generally the result of a prior game between the same two teams being postponed due to inclement weather or other factors. Most often the game is rescheduled for a day on which the two teams play each other again. Often it is within the same series, but in some cases, may be weeks or months after the original date. On rare occasions, the last game between two teams in that particular city is rained out, and a doubleheader may be scheduled at the other team's home park to replace the missed game.\nCurrently, major-league teams playing two games in a day usually play a \"day-night doubleheader\", in which the stadium is emptied of spectators and a separate admission is required for the second game. However, such games are officially regarded as separate games on the same date, rather than as a doubleheader. True doubleheaders are less commonly played. Classic doubleheaders, also known as day doubleheaders, were more common in the past, and although they are rare in the major leagues, they still are played at the minor league and college levels.\nIn , at least one league played a quarter of its games as classic doubleheaders. The rate declined to 10% in 1979. Eventually, eight years passed between two officially scheduled doubleheaders. Reasons for the decline include clubs' desire to maximize revenue, longer duration of games, five-day pitching rotation as opposed to four-day rotation, time management of relievers and catchers, and lack of consensus among players.\nTypes of doubleheaders.\nThe Official Baseball Rules used by Major League Baseball (MLB) discuss doubleheaders in section 4.08. The document makes mention of \"conventional\" and \"split\" doubleheaders.\nConventional.\nIn conventional doubleheaders, a spectator may attend both games by purchasing a single ticket. After the first game ends, a break, normally lasting 30 to 45 minutes per the \"Official Baseball Rules\", occurs and the second game is then started. For statistical purposes, the attendance is counted only for the second game, with the first game's attendance recorded as zero. \nDay.\nThe \"classic\" day doubleheader consists of the first game played in the early afternoon and, following a break, the second is played in the late afternoon. This was often done out of necessity in the years before many ballparks had lights. Often, if either game went into extra innings, the second game was eventually called when it grew dark.\nThis type of doubleheader is now more prominent in Minor League Baseball. It is now uncommon in the major leagues, even for rain makeups, since the use of stadium lights allows for night games. They are still occasionally scheduled, one example being the Tampa Bay Rays hosting the Oakland Athletics in a single-admission doubleheader starting at 1:05p.m. on the afternoon of June 10, 2017, at Tropicana Field.\nTwi-night.\nIn a twi-night (short for \"twilight-night\") doubleheader, the first game is played in the late afternoon and, following a break, the second begins at night. Under the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) between MLB and the Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA), this is allowed provided the start time of the first game is no later than 5:00 p.m. local time, although they generally start at 4:00 p.m. This type of doubleheader is still used in the minor leagues, or occasionally in MLB as the result of a rainout.\nSplit.\nIn a split or \"day-night\" doubleheader, the first game is played in the early afternoon and the second is played at night. In this scenario, separate tickets are sold for admission to each individual game. Such doubleheaders are favored by major-league organizations because they can charge admission for each game individually, and most often occur as the result of a rainout, where tickets have already been sold to the individual games.\nExcept in special circumstances with the approval of the MLBPA, such as a makeup game resulting from a rainout, scheduling split doubleheaders is prohibited under the terms of the 2002 CBA. Exceptions have occurred; for example, on August 22, 2012, the Arizona Diamondbacks hosted the Miami Marlins in a day-night doubleheader, the first doubleheader ever played at Chase Field, which was arranged due to a scheduling error violating another section of the CBA, which prohibits teams from being scheduled to play on more than 20 consecutive days.\nSince the , the CBA has allowed teams to expand their active roster by one player (currently from 26 to 27 players) for split doubleheaders, as long as those doubleheaders were scheduled with at least 48 hours' notice.\nTripleheaders.\nThree instances of a tripleheader are recorded in MLB, indicating three games between the same two teams on the same day. These occurred between the Brooklyn Bridegrooms and Pittsburgh Innocents on September 1, 1890 (Brooklyn won all three); between the Baltimore Orioles and Louisville Colonels on September 7, 1896 (Baltimore won all three); and between the Pittsburgh Pirates and Cincinnati Reds on October 2, 1920 (Cincinnati won two of the three). \nTripleheaders are prohibited under the current CBA, except if the first game is the conclusion of a game suspended from a prior date: this would only happen in the extremely rare event when the only remaining dates between teams are doubleheaders, and no single games are left for the suspended game to precede.\nNear the end of the 2019 season, a Friday doubleheader between the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox was rained out after one of the games started but before five innings were played. As a result, one of the games was made up as part of a doubleheader on Saturday while the other was canceled, as it had no bearing on the postseason. Had the broader use of suspended games been in place in MLB during 2019, it is possible that a tripleheader could have been played on Saturday, beginning with the conclusion of the suspended game.\nSeven-inning doubleheaders.\nUnder some rulesets, games played as part of a doubleheader last seven innings each instead of the usual nine.\nIn college and minor league baseball.\nCollege and minor league baseball typically use seven-inning doubleheaders. This applies even in the postseason; in 1994, the first game of the five-game Pacific Coast League championship series between Vancouver and Albuquerque was rained out; the two teams played a doubleheader, seven innings each, on the originally scheduled date of the second game. In the minors, if the first game is the completion of a suspended game from a prior day, the suspended game is played to completion (seven or nine innings, whichever it was scheduled to be when it started), and the second game of the doubleheader is seven innings.\nIn leagues which place a runner on second base at the start of extra innings, the rule applies starting in the eighth inning.\nIn Major League Baseball, 2020–2021.\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the start of MLB's season to July from its original intended start in March, the league announced on July 31 that all doubleheader games would be scheduled for seven innings each during the shortened season, to reduce strain on teams' pitchers. The league and the MLBPA came to an agreement to put this rule in place only for the 2020 season, later extended to the season as well. The season reverted to nine-inning doubleheaders.\nThe first major-league seven-inning doubleheader was played on August 2, 2020, between the Cincinnati Reds and the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park, with the Reds winning both games.\nStatistical impact.\nSome major-league feats in a seven-inning game were counted as-is, while others were not. For example, a shutout was credited when it occurred in a seven-inning game; Reds pitcher Trevor Bauer threw the first seven-inning shutout under the rule.\nA no-hitter was only credited if the game lasted at least nine innings (i.e. extra innings were played, due to a tie score). Under the 1991 guidelines recognizing major-league no-hitters, the feat is only officially recognized when a team's pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits in a minimum of nine innings (that is, records at least 27 outs without allowing a hit). On April 25, 2021, Madison Bumgarner of the Arizona Diamondbacks pitched a complete seven-inning game allowing no hits to the Atlanta Braves in the second game of a doubleheader, but did not receive credit for a no-hitter. Five pitchers of the Tampa Bay Rays held the Cleveland Indians hitless in a seven-inning game, the second game of a doubleheader on July 7, 2021, and also did not receive credit for a no-hitter.\nDoubleheaders of note.\nThe home-and-home doubleheader, in which each team hosts one game, is extremely rare, as it requires the teams' home ballparks to be in close geographical proximity. During the 20th century and before the advent of interleague play in 1997, only one instance was recorded in Major League Baseball: a Labor Day special event involving the New York Giants and Brooklyn Superbas.\nThis is the only home-and-home doubleheader known to have been part of the original major league season schedule.\nSince interleague play began, the New York Mets and the New York Yankees have on three occasions played home-and-home doubleheaders. Each occasion was due to a rainout during the first series of the season. During the second series of the season, a makeup game was scheduled at the ballpark of the opposing team as part of a day-night doubleheader.\nOn September 13, 1951, the St. Louis Cardinals hosted a doubleheader against two different teams. The first game was a 6–4 win against the New York Giants. The second game resulted in a 2–0 loss to the Boston Braves. \nOn September 25, 2000, the Cleveland Indians also hosted a doubleheader against two different teams. The September 10 game against the Chicago White Sox in Cleveland had been rained out. With no common days off for the remainder of the season and both teams in a postseason race, the teams agreed to play a day game in Cleveland on the same day that the Indians were to host the Minnesota Twins for a night game. The Indians defeated the White Sox 9–2 in the first game, while the Twins defeated the Indians 4–3 in the second.\nOn occasion, teams may play both games of a doubleheader at the same park, but one team is designated home for each game. This is usually the result of earlier postponements. For example, in 2007, when snow storms in northern Ohio caused the Cleveland Indians to postpone an entire four-game series from April 5–8 against the Seattle Mariners; three of the games were made up in Cleveland throughout the season, while the fourth was made up as part of a doubleheader in Seattle on September 26 with the Indians as the designated home team for the first game. The Indians won the first game acting as the home team, 12–4, but lost the second as the away team, 3–2.\nIn popular culture.\nNational Baseball Hall of Fame inductee Ernie Banks, who spent his entire MLB career with the Chicago Cubs, was known for his catchphrase, \"It's a beautiful day for a ballgame ... Let's play two!\", expressing his wish to play a doubleheader every day out of his love of baseball."

        "text": "Henry Bell is a former American football halfback who played one season in the American Football League (AFL) for the Denver Broncos. He never attended college and played for several military service teams in Hawaii and Kansas before his one year in professional football. One of the original members of the Broncos, he was one of their main backs and played in 10 games while rushing for 238 yards.\nEarly life and military service.\nPro Football Archives lists him as being born in 1937 in Georgia, although a 1959 article from \"The Manhattan Mercury\" identified him as a native of Hawaii. Several modern sources also list him as having attended Valdosta High School, but \"The Mercury\" stated that he went to Boy's High School in Brooklyn, New York. He recalled in an interview in 2018 that he had been offered an athletic scholarship to play for the Kansas State Wildcats, but was unable to attend. Bell then began to serve in the United States Army in 1955 and played football and track and field for several military teams.\nBeing a member of the 25th Infantry Division stationed in Hawaii, Bell won the division track and field championships in 1956 with a 100-yard dash time of 9.8, as well as a 21.9-second 220-yard dash time. In football, he was named a Hawaii Army All-Star selection in all three years with the team (1955–1957) while playing both sides of the ball. On offense, the 5 ft 11 in, 200-pound halfback scored 16 touchdowns in 1956 and was selected to be a member of the Hawaii Pros, a team that played the College All-Stars in the Hula Bowl. He was one of only two people from the army to make the team.\nAfter playing for the 25th Infantry Division, Bell played with the Funston Red Raiders of Fort Riley in Kansas, being named All-Army in 1959 after running for over 1,000 yards and scoring 13 touchdowns in just eight games. He was known for his ability to make long runs, with nine of his scores being over 20 yards. \"The Manhattan Mercury\" described Bell as a speedy player but a hard-hitter and said that whether he \"is lugging the ball or making noise as a decoy, he is a dangerous man to be left unwatched on any football field.\"\nProfessional career.\nBell was signed by the Denver Broncos of the newly-formed American Football League (AFL) in July 1960. He later recalled his experience getting signed: \"A guy came up to my houseI lived in Redondo Beachand said, 'They're coming out with a new football league. Would you like to play?' I said, 'Yeah!' His name was Dean Griffing.\" Despite having never played college football, Bell was able to make the Broncos' final roster; he was one of only six players active in either the AFL or National Football League (NFL) that season to have never played collegiately. He was also one of eight black players on the original Broncos team. When asked in 2018 about how organized the league was, he said \"There wasn't any [organization]. It was, 'There's a football game. Get together and go out there and play.' The money was good! The quarterback was [Frank] Tripucka, and we had a good team, I think.\"\nBell served as one of the team's primary backs, along with Dave Rolle. The Broncos played 14 games and went 4–9–1, with Bell appearing in 10 of those games while starting five; he placed second on the team with 43 rush attempts for 238 yards (a 5.5 average), also posting the Broncos' longest run of the season (and the league's fifth-longest) with a 68-yard rush. He became limited by a turf toe injury that occurred during a game against the Los Angeles Chargers and was released around December 1. Bell never played professional football again."

        "text": "Burnaby Lake Rugby Club is a rugby club based in Burnaby, British Columbia.\nHistory.\nThe Burnaby Lake Rugby Club was formed in 1994 when two Metro Vancouver rugby clubs, the Burnaby Buffaloes and the Vancouver Trojans, merged.\nBecause the Buffaloes played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union and the Trojans played in the Vancouver Rugby Union, these two clubs did not have long-standing rivalries, which accounted a great deal for the success of the merger. As a result of the merger the newly formed Burnaby Lake Rugby Club (BLRC) became one of the larger clubs in the Metro Vancouver Area, consistently fielding teams at the most competitive levels in British Columbia.\nThe BLRC also has a long-standing association with Justice Rugby Club. The Justice Rugby Club is a social rugby club, that plays non-league invitational matches in Canada and abroad. The membership of Justice Rugby consists of police officers in the Metro Vancouver area and their friends. Many of these members are also members of the BLRC.\nThe Burnaby Lake Rugby Club first played in the Fraser Valley Rugby Union (FVRU) after the merger in 1994. However, the BLRC membership voted to join the Vancouver Rugby Union (VRU) during the 1995/1996 Annual General Meeting and the BLRC was accepted as a member of the VRU in 1996, where it has stayed a member since.\nTeams.\nThe BLRC fields four Senior Men's teams. The Premier XV and First XV play in the British Columbia CDI Premier League. The BLRC's Third XV and Third XV(B), are part of the Lower Mainland 3rd Division League. Burnaby Lake have been crowned Provincial Champions and have had all teams make play off's and finals\nBLRC is represented in the Premier Division of BC Rugby Women's League. In 2003, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2013 the BLRC Senior Women won the BC Premier Women's Provincial Championship. The club also fields a Women's team in the Lower Mainland Second Division League that focuses on player development.\nThe BLRC has a mini Rugby program (ages 5 – 12) that aims to teach young rugby players the basics of running and passing, as well as the laws of the game. The club also fields teams in the U-14, U-16, U-17 and U-19 Lower Mainland Leagues.\nRugby Sevens in BC is played at tournaments throughout the Summer in a points format similar to the IRB Sevens series. The BLRC Lighthouse Sevens program have been perennial contenders in both Elite Men's and Women's Divisions. The Men have been crowned Champions 5 times and the women 4 times since the Series began in 2009.\nFacilities.\nBLRC facility consists of two dedicated match pitches and a lit all weather turf practice field. The clubhouse is situated at the Burnaby Lake Sports Complex in Burnaby.\nNotable players.\nThe BLRC has produced numerous players of distinction who have played representative rugby both in Canada and internationally."

He became one of only 43 players who have won the Rugby World Cup on multiple occasions.\nCrowley's family moved to Australia from the United Kingdom, first to Central Queensland, then to Brisbane.\nCrowley made his first appearance for the Wallabies at age 23 on 1 July 1989 in a match against the British Lions, which Australia won 30 points to 12. He also played in the two subsequent tests, which the Lions won. His next appearance for the Wallabies was at the 1991 Rugby World Cup which Australia went on to win. He earned two international caps in 1999 in tests against Ireland and Wales. He also played against Canada in Calgary the following year. \nIn 1995 he was capped twice for Australia for two games against Argentina, before heading to South Africa for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. He played in the losses to the Springboks and England. In 1997 he was capped on seven occasions for Australia, and then ten times during 1998. He was subsequently selected in Australia's 1999 Rugby World Cup squad for Wales. Crowley finished his international career as a double world champion, as his last game was the final against France, which Australia won 35 to 12. He is now one of the Reds' most capped players - with 124. He was also named on the bench of the Wallaby Team of the Decade. \nCrowley also worked as an undercover police officer with the Queensland Police Force, specialising in busting drug-rings on Queensland's Gold Coast. He writes of his experiences in his book \"Undercover Prop\", and works as a motivational speaker. On some occasions, he was even working undercover during rugby tours in New Zealand."

The tournament was scheduled to be held from Monday 25 June until Saturday 7 July 1973 but rain on the final Friday meant that the women's singles final was postponed until Saturday and the mixed doubles final was rescheduled to Sunday 8 July. It was the 87th staging of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam tennis event of 1973. Jan Kodeš and Billie Jean King won the singles titles. King became the first player in the open era to claim the triple crown, the second time in her career she won all three titles open to women players. Her three victories necessitated playing six matches on the final weekend of the tournament: The singles final, the doubles semi-final and final and the mixed doubles quarter-final, semi-final and final, which was played on the extended Sunday schedule.\nATP boycott.\nIn May 1973 Nikola Pilić, Yugoslavia's number one tennis player, was suspended by his national lawn tennis association, the Yugoslav Tennis Association, which claimed he had refused to play in a Davis Cup tie for his country against New Zealand earlier that month. The initial suspension of nine months, supported by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF), later was reduced by the ILTF to one month, which meant that Pilić would not be permitted to play at Wimbledon. The recently formed men's players union, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), stated that none should compete if Pilić were not allowed to compete. As a result, 81 of the top players, including reigning champion Stan Smith, boycotted Wimbledon in 1973 to protest the suspension of Nikola Pilić. Twelve of the 16 men's seeds had withdrawn. This resulted in a large number of qualifiers and lucky losers.\nThree ATP players, Ilie Năstase, Roger Taylor and Ray Keldie, defied the boycott and were fined by the ATP's disciplinary committee. Năstase unsuccessfully appealed the fine as he insisted that as a serving captain, he was under orders from the Romanian army and government to compete. Some contemporary press speculation and later biographies have suggested Năstase contrived to lose his fourth round match as he supported the ATP boycott, but to have lost any earlier to a considerably less able player would have been too obvious. Năstase never has commented on this speculation. Despite the boycott, the attendance of 300,172 was the second highest in the championships' history to that date.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize money for 1973 championships was £52,400. The winner of the men's title earned £5,000 while the women's singles champion earned £3,000.\nChampions.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\n Jan Kodeš defeated Alex Metreveli, 6–1, 9–8(7–5), 6–3\nWomen's singles.\n Billie Jean King defeated Chris Evert, 6–0, 7–5\nMen's doubles.\n Jimmy Connors / Ilie Năstase defeated John Cooper / Neale Fraser, 3–6, 6–3, 6–4, 8–9(3–7), 6–1\nWomen's doubles.\n Rosemary Casals / Billie Jean King defeated Françoise Dürr / Betty Stöve, 6–1, 4–6, 7–5\nMixed doubles.\n Owen Davidson / Billie Jean King defeated Raúl Ramírez / Janet Newberry, 6–3, 6–2\nJuniors.\nBoys' singles.\n Billy Martin defeated Colin Dowdeswell, 6–2, 6–4\nGirls' singles.\n Ann Kiyomura defeated Martina Navrátilová, 6–4, 7–5\nSingles seeds.\nMen's singles.\nThe original seeding list before the boycott was:"

In December 2015, Picard was added to the roster of NLA side HC Davos for the Spengler Cup, and for the third time was part of the Cup-winning team. Following his impressive showing, Davos offered him a contract for the remainder of the 2015–16 season, which he signed in January 2016.\nPicard left Switzerland upon the conclusion of the 2015–16 season and signed a one-year contract with Kunlun Red Star for their inaugural Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) season, but eventually did not play for the team. On November 29, 2016, he joined HK Hradec Králové of the Czech Extraliga."

        "title": "History of the England national rugby union team",
        "text": "The History of the England national rugby union team covers the period since 1871, when the England national rugby union team played Scotland in the first ever rugby union international.\nFirst match.\nThe game of rugby union developed out of the game of football that was played at Rugby School from the mid-18th century. In the first half of the 19th century, the game began to spread, as ex-pupils of Rugby, and other public schools, introduced it into the universities. At Cambridge University, in 1839, a game was organised between Old Rugbeians and Old Etonians, and a rugby club was formed at Guy's Hospital, London in 1843. The rules of Rugby were first codified at Rugby School by William Delafield Arnold, W. W. Shirley and Frederick Hutchins in 1845. In 1848, representatives of the major public schools agreed a code of rules. On 26 January 1871, a meeting was held in London that led to the founding of the Rugby Football Union. Following a challenge from Scottish members, teams representing England and Scotland met at Raeburn Place, Edinburgh, on 27 March 1871 in the first ever international rugby union match. Scotland won by four points to one, in front of 4,000 people.\n1872–1899.\nIn a return match at the Kennington Oval, London, on 5 February 1872, England won 8–3 (three tries, one conversion and one drop goal, to one drop goal). The next game between the two nations was at Hamilton Crescent, Glasgow, and resulted in a draw. The succeeding match between the two nations took place two years later on Monday 23 February 1874 at the same location as their first game. England again won the game, though this time the score was a lot closer; England winning just three points to one.\nThe following year England played their first game against the Irish at the Oval, winning seven nil; the match was Ireland's first Test. Another match between England and Ireland was held in December, with England winning again. Games were played against Scotland and Ireland in 1876 and 1877 respectively, and although holding the opponents scoreless, the margin of scoring was low. A second game against Scotland that year resulted in England's first loss since their first game.\nIn 1878 Ireland hosted England at the Lansdowne Road stadium in Dublin. England emerged as winners, defeating Ireland seven points to nil. After defeating Ireland in 1879, England followed this up with another victory at Lansdowne Road; although the game was a lot closer, with England winning four points to one. England hosted Scotland in 1880 at the Whalley Range ground in Manchester; which they won to become the first winners of the Calcutta Cup. They beat Ireland at the same ground a year later.\nEngland played Wales for the first time, on 19 February 1881 at Richardson's Field in Blackheath. England racked up their largest victory, defeating the Welsh 30 points to nil. The subsequent meeting the following year at St Helens in Swansea was a closer contest; with England winning 10 nil. England drew with Scotland then Ireland in 1881/82, and were then beaten by Scotland in 1882. Scotland came close to defeating England again in 1883. The two try to one try win to England was watched by a crowd of 10,000. That year, the first Home Nations championship was held, and England emerged as the inaugural winners.\nIn 1884, England defeated Wales at the northern venue of Cardigan Fields in Leeds. This was followed by a successful defence of their Home Nations trophy, although the 1885 tournament was not completed. Despite the tournament not being completed, 1886 would have been a shared victory with Scotland. In 1887, Ireland defeated England for the first time. In 1889, England played their first match against a non-home nations team. England defeated the \"New Zealand Natives\" 7–0 at Rectory Field in Blackheath.\nIn 1890 England shared the Home Nations trophy with Scotland. The following year England lost their game against Scotland, who won the tournament. However, the following year, England won all their games and won the tournament outright. England did not perform as well in the subsequent tournaments, only winning one game in both the 1893 and 1894 Home Nations championships. They won two of their three games in 1895, but dropped to winning one game in the 1896 and 1897 championships. They experienced a Home Nations whitewash in 1899, when they failed to win a game.\n1900–1939.\nAfter winning one match in 1900, England was again whitewashed in 1901. They returned to form the following year, dropping one game. In 1905 England again lost all of their Home Nations games, and ended the year with their first encounter with the New Zealand All Blacks; the All Blacks won 15–0. In 1906 France began playing in the Home Nations tournament, and England won their matches against France and Scotland. Also in 1906, England played the South Africa (known as the \"Springboks\") for the first time; drawing three all. England began their 1907 Home Nations with a big win, defeating France by 28 points at the Athletic Ground in Richmond. This was followed by three straight losses to the other home nations. England performed slightly better the following year, winning two of their four fixtures. This result was repeated in the 1909 Home Nations. England played Australia (known as the \"Wallabies\") for the first time in 1909; losing three points to nine.\nTwickenham was opened as the RFU's new home in 1910. This heralded a golden era for English rugby union. England's first international at Twickenham brought them success over Wales, and England won the International Championship (also known as the Five Nations) for the first time since the great schism of 1895. Their title coincided with the rise of Harlequin F.C., whose brand of attacking rugby led to a purple period in the years leading up to the Great War. England did not retain the title in 1911; winning and losing two games. England only lost one game (to Scotland) in the 1912 Five Nations, and thus shared that championship with Ireland. A Grand Slam of the Five Nations was achieved by England in 1913 (meaning they won every game). England successfully defended the title at the 1914 Five Nations, and achieved another Grand Slam.\nThere were no games between 1914 and 1920 owing to the First World War, but when the Five Nations resumed in 1921 England continued where they left off; winning another Grand Slam. Davies returned to head the attack, and Wavell Wakefield pioneered specialisation in the scrum to give England an edge in forward play. They lost a game to eventual champions Wales and drew with France in the 1922 championship. In both 1924 and 1925 England won the Grand Slam.\nThey started 1925 off with a loss to the All Black \"Invincibles\" in front of 60,000 fans at Twickenham. This was followed by two wins, a draw and a loss at the 1925 Five Nations. England slipped to just the one win in 1926; with a draw and two losses in the Five Nations that year. This was followed by two wins and two losses at the subsequent championship. In 1928 England returned to Five Nations form, and produced a Grand Slam in the process. Although they only won the two games at the 1929 championship, England won it again in 1930. The following year, the tournament returned to its Home Nations format after France were excluded due to allegations of professionalism.\nThe 1931 Home Nations resulted in a three-way tie between Ireland, England and Wales. That same year England played the Springboks in front of 70,000 at Twickenham. England won the 1934 Home Nations with a \"Triple Crown\". In 1935 England achieved their first victory the All Blacks; thanks in part to Obolensky's famous try. The victory is still England's biggest over New Zealand. In 1937, England won the Home Nations, with a Triple Crown. Scotland won the following year, but England shared the championship again a year later, with Ireland and Wales.\n1940–1979.\nDue to World War II, the Five Nations was not held again until 1947. France were now back in the tournament. England won a shared 1947 championship with Wales; losing just the one game. The following year England did not win a game; drawing with Wales and losing the rest of their games. The 1949 championship was better for England when they won half of their games. The early Five Nations competitions of the 1950s were unsuccessful for England; winning one match in the 1950 and 1951 championships. England toured to South Africa for the first time in 1952 where they lost to the Springboks three points to eight. The Five Nations was better that year however, as England won half their games. England was victorious at the 1953 Five Nations, winning all their matches except for a draw with Wales. This was followed up by a three-way tie with France and Wales the following year. They won only one game at the next year, as well as drawing another.\nEngland won two of their games at the 1956 Five Nations, and followed this up with a Grand Slam the next year. They drew two games in the 1958 Five Nations, which was enough for them to win the championship. They also defeated Australia in England that year. Two draws, a loss and one win resulted at the 1959 Five Nations. France dominated the Five Nations championship for the early years of the 1960s, but England did share a win with them in 1960. Following this shared championship, England lost to the Springboks at the start of the year and only managed to win one game in the 1961 Five Nations. They drew twice in 1962, winning and losing their other games.\nThe following year England broke France's four-championship streak by winning the 1963 Championship. After this victory, England played three tests in the Southern Hemisphere and lost all three; 21–11 and 9–6 against the All Blacks, and 18–9 against Australia. The All Blacks came to England the following year; defeating England 14–0. England did not win a single game in 1966, and managed only a draw with Ireland. They did not win another Championship that decade.\nThe RFU's centenary year was 1971 when England struggled to overcome Japan 6–3 in Tokyo. Nevertheless, England had wins against southern hemisphere teams that decade; with victories over South Africa in 1972, New Zealand in 1973 and Australia in 1976 (albeit losing twice to the Wallabies in previous weeks). The 1972 Five Nations Championship was not completed due to the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Following the British embassy in Dublin being burnt down by a mob after Bloody Sunday, and threatening letters being sent to players, Scotland and Wales refused to play their Five Nations away fixtures in Ireland. England played in Dublin the following year and were given a standing ovation that lasted for five minutes. After losing 18–9 at Lansdowne Road, the England captain, John Pullin famously stated, \"We might not be very good but at least we turned up.\"\n1980–1999.\nThanks to a 9–8 (three penalties to two tries) victory against a 14-man Wales, England started the decade with a Grand Slam victory in the 1980 Five Nations – their first for 23 years. This earned England their first BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award. The victory was something of a false dawn and the remainder of the decade was not a great period for the England team. The subsequent Championship of 1981 was less successful for England, winning two of their four games, and was followed up with a draw and win against Argentina. England kicked off 1982 with a victory over the Wallabies in a tight game, winning 15 to 11 in England; the game was made famous by Erica Roe's famous streak across the pitch. Their Five Nations campaign was similarly successful, drawing with Scotland, losing to Ireland, and victories over France and Wales. At the match banquet after the win against France in Paris, there was a complimentary bottle of cologne next to each player's place at the table. Second row Maurice Colclough emptied the flask and refilled it with wine, which he then drank. Team-mate Colin Smart saw only Colclough seemingly sink a bottle of cologne and decided to follow suit. Within an hour he was on his way to hospital to have his stomach pumped, although as scrum-half Steve Smith pointed out: 'He may have been unwell, but Colin had the nicest breath I've smelt.'\nIn the 1983 Five Nations England failed to win a game and picked up the wooden spoon. This inadvertently lead to the formation of the Rugby charity the Wooden Spoon Society. England drew Wales and lost their other three matches, although they completed the year with an impressive 15–9 victory over the All Blacks in England. England improved slightly in the following Five Nations, but still managed only one win. That year the Springboks put 35 points on England in two tests in South Africa, and the Wallabies defeated them at Twickenham. 1985 started with a close win over Romania, followed by a Five Nations draw with France. After a win over Scotland, England succumbed to losses against Ireland and Wales in their remaining Five Nations fixtures. England then lost twice to the All Blacks on tour to New Zealand – 18–13, and a convincing 42–15.\nEngland won two of their four games at the 1986 Five Nations and in the following championship, only won the one game against Scotland. In the first Rugby World Cup in New Zealand and Australia, England were grouped in pool A alongside Australia, Japan and the United States. England lost their first game 19–6 against Australia. They went on to defeat Japan 60–7, and the United States, 34–6, to place them second in their pool. They met Wales in their quarter-final and lost the match 16–3.\nEngland opened their 1988 Five Nations with a 10–9 loss to France, which was followed by defeat against Wales. England, however, finished the championship by defeating both Scotland and Ireland. England lost two games against Australia in the same year as well. Their 1989 Five Nations was an improvement over the previous championship, winning two games and drawing another with just the one loss to Wales. England then won games against Romania and Fiji, and carried this winning streak over into 1990, winning their first three Five Nations games. They lost to Scotland in their last game however, and hence Scotland achieved a Grand Slam. In 1991 England had ideal preparation for that year's World Cup, by winning their first Grand Slam since 1980.\nOn 14 July 1991, the Argentine amateur club Banco Nación defeated England's national team in a surprise 29–21 victory at José Amalfitani Stadium of Buenos Aires.\nEngland hosted the 1991 Rugby World Cup and were in pool A, along with the All Blacks, Italy and the United States. The opening game of the tournament at Twickenham was the clash between the All Blacks and England, which the All Blacks won 18–12. England subsequently defeated Italy 36–6 and the United States 37–9, to finish second in their pool. England faced pool D winners France, in Parc des Princes in Paris. In a fiercely contested match they defeated France 19–10. The win earned England a semi-final berth against Scotland at Murrayfield in Edinburgh. England won 9–6 to secure a place in the final against Australia. The final was played in front of a capacity crowd at Twickenham, and England eventually lost the match 12–6. This left Australia as the 1991 World Champions. England again won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award albeit shared with the Men's Olympic 4 × 400 m relay squad.\nThe next year, England completed another Grand Slam in the 1992 Five Nations. They extended this success to the rest of their fixtures that year by beating Canada and the newly reinstated Springboks. The winning run continued into 1993 by defeating France and their opening game of the Five Nations. They then lost to the Welsh in their next game, and won their following game against Scotland before losing to Ireland. In November of that year, England then defeated the All Blacks 15–9. England were awarded the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award in 1993, for the third time. England lost just the one game at the 1994 Five Nations, and their only other loss that year was their second test against the Springboks.\nIn the lead up to the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, England completed another Grand Slam – their third in five years. With the Five Nations trophy, England headed into pool B of the World Cup, grouped with Argentina, Italy and Samoa. England won their opening game, defeating Argentina 24–18, and went on to narrowly defeat Italy 27–20 and then Samoa, 44–22. England faced Australia in the quarter-finals, where they went on to win, the final score 25–22. England moved into the semi-finals, where they met the powerful All Blacks. In a match dominated by the All Blacks and featuring four tries by Jonah Lomu, England lost 45–29. They then lost the third/fourth place match against France, while South Africa emerged as World Champions against the All Blacks.\nIn 1996, a deal between British Sky Broadcasting and the Rugby Football Union meant that England home games were exclusively shown on Sky. This deal caused great controversy at the time and England were threatened with being expelled from the five nations to be replaced by Italy. This threat was never carried out with the understanding that all future television deals would be negotiated collectively.\nIn 1997 former international and member of the 1980 Grand Slam winning team, Clive Woodward became coach of the England team. In that year England managed a draw with New Zealand at Twickenham, after being routed in Manchester the week before. Many of the England team made themselves unavailable for the disastrous summer 1998 tour to Australia, New Zealand and South Africa nicknamed the 'Tour of Hell' where England suffered a humiliating 76–0 defeat by the Wallabies. In the 1998 and 1999 Five Nations England failed to win their crucial games, and handed titles to France in 1998 and Scotland in 1999 by failing to beat France and Wales respectively. In the last ever Five Nations match (the tournament would admit Italy the following season and become known as the Six Nations) Scott Gibbs sliced through six English tackles to score in the last minute. England were defeated and the last ever Five nations title went to Scotland.\n2000–2003.\nEngland commenced the new decade by winning the inaugural Six Nations title, but missing a Grand Slam due to defeat in their last match of the tournament to Scotland. An outbreak of foot and mouth disease in Britain disrupted the 2001 Six nations championship, and Ireland's matches against Wales, Scotland and England were postponed until later that year. Ireland then defeated England 20–14 at Lansdowne Road to deny them a Grand Slam. Although the 2002 Six Nations title was won by France, England did win the Triple Crown.\nIn June 2002 England, captained by Phil Vickery and with five new caps, defeated a full-strength Argentina team in Buenos Aires. Then in November that year under captain Martin Johnson, England defeated the three Southern Hemisphere giants at Twickenham. England first defeated the All Blacks, whose team included seven débutantes, by three points. Australia were beaten 32–31 the following week. The match against South Africa, unlike England's previous two matches, was easily won 53–3; their biggest ever win over the Springboks.\nIn 2003, England continued to progress and not only won the Grand Slam for the first time since 1995 but also maintained 2 years dominance by being the No.1 team in the world. After beating the previous tournament winner and Grand Slam champion, France in their opening match and going on to defeat the Welsh at Millennium Stadium, the remaining matches saw England put 40 or more points on every opponent. This was followed by wins over Australia and New Zealand in a pre world cup tour in June.\nGoing into the Rugby World Cup of 2003 they were one of the favourites for the title and after some minor stumbles along the way they reached the final on 22 November 2003 where they met Australia. England were crowned champions of the world following a drop goal in the final half-minute of extra time by Jonny Wilkinson. The final scoreline was 20–17 in a game that is considered one of the greatest rugby games ever seen. Three days later the English team arrived at the Heathrow airport in the early hours of the morning to be greeted by thousands of fans. On 8 December a national day of celebration like none that had ever been seen before took place. The English team greeted an estimated 750,000 supporters in their parade through London before going on to be greeted by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace.\nEngland again won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award with Jonny Wilkinson finishing ahead of Martin Johnson for the individual awards.\nSince the start of the decade, England had dominated world rugby winning 29 and losing only 5 matches against the other seven major rugby playing nations. This included a perfect record of 16 wins and no losses at Twickenham. In addition, England had won 12 successive matches against the three Tri Nations teams including victories in New Zealand, South Africa and Australia (twice). England's old nemesis, Wales, had truly been put to the sword with six successive wins for the red rose.\n2004–2006.\nAfter their World Cup win, a number of senior players, including captain Martin Johnson announced their retirement. In the 2004 Six Nations Championship tournament, England lost to both France and Ireland and finished third. In late August 2004, captain Lawrence Dallaglio temporarily retired from international rugby. Sir Clive Woodward resigned on 2 September and Andy Robinson was appointed head coach. Robinson had been on Woodward's coaching staff for the duration of the World Cup campaign. Robinson's first Six Nations campaign in 2005 was even less successful than 2004; with fourth place after losing three, and winning two matches.\nMany England players were involved in the unsuccessful British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand in 2005; where they were beaten 3–0 by the All Blacks. The England coach Andy Robinson was also part of Clive Woodward's coaching team on the tour. There was a brief break before the 2005 end of year internationals and the 2006 Six Nations Championship. England hosted Australia on 12 November at Twickenham where England beat their old rivals 26–16. The following week (19 November) the All Blacks visited Twickenham and eventually ran out 23–19 winners over England. Despite the loss England's performance was considered an indication they would better compete in the 2006 Six Nations.\nIn the 2006 Six Nations an opening win over Wales gave England a promising start. This was followed by an unconvincing victory over Italy, then defeats to both Scotland and France. Coach Robinson responded by making seven changes for the final match against Ireland; which they lost to hand Ireland the triple crown. An RFU review following the Six Nations decided to bring in new coaching staff. Andy Robinson kept his place as head coach, and the position of Elite Rugby Director was created. After months of interviewing, Rob Andrew was appointed to the new position. The RFU also changed England's backroom staff by bringing in John Wells as Forwards coach, Mike Ford as Defence coach, and Brian Ashton as Attack coach. In 2006's mid-year rugby Tests England returned to Australia for a two-Test series. A squad mixed with youth and experience lost both Tests comprehensively; the first 34–3 and the second 43–18. This extended England's losing streak to five matches; their worst since 1984.\nEngland hosted four end-of-year internationals at Twickenham against New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa (twice) in 2006. England lost their first two matches of the series to New Zealand (20–41), and Argentina (18–25). Argentina's victory was their first over England at Twickenham. England managed to win against South Africa 23–21 avoiding a record eight match losing streak. However, the following week on Saturday 25 November, South Africa exacted revenge beat England 14–25. This left England with eight losses in their last nine Tests, their worst ever match record. Andy Robinson resigned as head coach and was replaced by Brian Ashton in December 2006.\n2007–2008.\nAshton's first game in charge was the Calcutta Cup match against Scotland in the 2007 Six Nations Championship. England won 42–20, Jonny Wilkinson scoring 27 of England's points. The next fixture was against Italy at Twickenham, which England won 20–7. England's third match of the tournament was against Ireland, at Croke Park. Ireland won 43–13, their biggest ever victory over England and the most points England had ever conceded in a Five/Six Nations match. England's inconsistency continued over the final two games: a 26–18 win over tournament favourites France at Twickenham – their first victory over France since the 2003 World Cup – was followed by a 27–18 loss at the Millennium Stadium to Wales, who were struggling to avoid the wooden spoon.\nEngland's preparations for the defence of their World Cup title were equally mixed. Ashton was deprived of many first-choice players for the short mid-year tour to South Africa, which saw England suffer two heavy defeats, 58–10 and 55–22. This was followed by a 62–5 win against a weakened Wales side and two losses to France, at home and away on consecutive weekends.\nEngland's World Cup defence started with an unconvincing 28–10 victory over the USA. A 36–0 loss to South Africa in the second pool game left England facing the prospect of becoming the first defending champions to be eliminated at the pool stage. But wins against Samoa and Tonga ensured qualification for the quarter-finals as pool runners-up.\nIn the quarter-finals, they faced Australia, who started as favourites, but England's forwards dominated the game, which England won 12–10, all the points being kicked by Jonny Wilkinson. Later the same day, France overcame tournament favourites, New Zealand, to set up a semi-final meeting with England.\nEngland took an early lead in the semi-final, after a fumble from French fullback Damien Traille enabled Josh Lewsey to score a try, and they hung on to win 14–9.\nIn the final, England faced South Africa for the second time in the tournament. Unlike the first game, the final was a tight contest, in which neither side managed to score a try, though England wing Mark Cueto came close, only to be denied after a review by the television match official. Percy Montgomery kicked a penalty to give South Africa the lead, and the Springboks managed to stay just ahead throughout the game, which they won 15–6.\nWith senior players such as Jason Robinson, Lawrence Dallaglio, Mike Catt and Martin Corry having retired, the 2008 Six Nations saw England fail to maintain the momentum from the latter part of their World Cup campaign. They threw away a comfortable half time lead to lose the opening game 26–19 to Wales, before recording a less than convincing 23–19 victory over Italy. Hopes were raised again as France were beaten 24–13 in Paris, but this was followed by a 15–9 defeat by previously winless Scotland in a tryless Murrayfield encounter. This ended English title hopes for another year, and Wilkinson was dropped for the final game with Ireland, after having become international rugby's record points scorer. His replacement Danny Cipriani had an inspired first full game, helping England to a 33–10 win which gave them second place in the standings, their best finish since 2003 despite an inconsistent campaign.\nOn 16 April 2008 Martin Johnson was appointed England team manager with effect from 1 July 2008, with Brian Ashton leaving the post immediately.\nIn the summer of 2008, before a tour of New Zealand, a second-string England played host to the Barbarians at Twickenham, edging the match 17–14 with tries from Nick Easter and Mathew Tait. It was nominally Martin Johnson's first match in charge although he would not take full control until after the summer tour to New Zealand.\nOn 14 June 2008, England began their tour of New Zealand and a young side were put to the sword in Auckland. Rob Andrew was in charge of England in a caretaker capacity, and after an impressive start it looked like England may have caused an upset but in a chastening evening for England, they lost 37–20 after standout performances from the All Blacks' Dan Carter and Ma'a Nonu.\nA week later, and England arrived in Christchurch for the second Test. It was to be another heavy defeat for a young England side, as they went down 44–12 to lose the Test series 2–0. The build-up to the Test had been overshadowed by allegations of sexual abuse levelled at four England players, although no formal complaint had been lodged and the players denied the allegations. NZ debutant Richard Kahui scored for New Zealand in the victory.\nMartin Johnson began his England reign with a 39–13 victory over a Pacific Islanders team at Twickenham in November 2008, with tries from Paul Sackey (2), Danny Cipriani, Nick Kennedy, and Lee Mears. England fielded four new caps in full-back Delon Armitage, wing Ugo Monye, inside centre Riki Flutey and second row Kennedy.\nEngland then hosted Australia at Twickenham and with room for improvement from the Pacific Islanders match, they lost 14–28. Australia illustrated the size of the challenge facing Martin Johnson in the match. Fly-half Matt Giteau punished the hosts with six penalties, Stirling Mortlock adding another long-range effort. England trailed 12–11 at the interval after a Delon Armitage drop-goal and a close-range try from Nick Easter. Danny Cipriani landed two penalties in a mixed display but Australia sealed victory with Adam Ashley-Cooper's try.\nOn 22 November, world champions South Africa handed England their record defeat at Twickenham as they repeated their victory in the World Cup final. An early penalty apiece made it 3–3 before Danie Rossouw and Ruan Pienaar both crossed for the visitors. South Africa led 20–6 at half-time, with England's only points coming from two Danny Cipriani penalties. And the Boks ran in three more tries as Adrian Jacobs, Jaque Fourie and Bryan Habana confirmed the gulf in class.\nEngland ended their autumn against New Zealand and after their disastrous summer tour all the signs were pointing to another heavy New Zealand win. England were made to pay for their indiscipline as New Zealand comfortably secured a 'grand slam' of the home nations on their autumn tour, winning 32–6 – the home side gave away a host of penalties and had four players sin-binned as they slumped to their third straight defeat at Twickenham. New Zealand battled to a 12–3 lead but they cut loose after the break. Full-back Mils Muliaina crossed twice in the right-hand corner while Ma'a Nonu added another as England tired. The autumn series gave Martin Johnson a lot to think about in the run-up to the Six Nations of 2009.\n2009–2010.\nEngland opened the 2009 Six Nations by playing host to Italy at Twickenham. They marked Martin Johnson's first Six Nations game in charge with an unconvincing victory. In a 36–11 victory, three Italy errors saw England take a commanding lead as Andy Goode, Harry Ellis and Riki Flutey went over. Goode added two conversions and a penalty but two Luke McLean penalties meant England led 22–6 at half-time. Ellis scored England's fourth try after the break and although Italy cut the gap through Mirco Bergamasco, Mark Cueto had the final word for the hosts.\nOn Valentine's Day 2009, England lost 23–15 to Wales at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Wales kept their pursuit of back-to-back Grand Slams on course but were made to battle all the way by England in a thrilling Six Nations encounter. Paul Sackey's try and an Andy Goode drop-goal saw England trail just 9–8 at half-time, Wales' points kicked by Stephen Jones and Leigh Halfpenny. Halfpenny scored Wales' crucial second-half try, with England's indiscipline letting Jones extend his side's lead. Delon Armitage scored a fine try to give England hope, but Wales held firm.\nAfter a week's bye, 28 February brought a trip to Croke Park in Dublin to face an Ireland side who had won their first two games relatively easily. Ireland maintained their Grand Slam challenge by scraping a hard-earned victory. Ireland skipper and man-of-the-match Brian O'Driscoll powered over for their only try in the 57th minute. But with Ronan O'Gara landing only two of his six kicks, Ireland were helped by the sin-binning of England prop Phil Vickery and scrum-half Danny Care. England were left to rue that indiscipline after Delon Armitage's late try and Andy Goode's conversion in a 14–13 loss.\nIn week 4, in early March, England got their campaign back on track with a 34–10 win over France, with a magnificent first-half display to run out five-try winners at Twickenham. Martin Johnson's under-pressure side answered their critics in emphatic fashion and led 29–0 at the break. Mark Cueto, Riki Flutey, Delon Armitage and Joe Worsley all crossed in an astonishing first period before Flutey added his second. France improved in the second half and scored through Dimitri Szarzewski and Julien Malzieu but the game was won.\nTo finish their campaign England hosted Scotland at Twickenham for the 121st Calcutta Cup. England survived a disappointing second-half performance to regain the Calcutta Cup. The Scots took the lead through a Chris Paterson penalty but England hit back with Ugo Monye and Riki Flutey tries. Toby Flood kicked the hosts into an 18–3 lead early in the second half but Scotland fought back through the boots of Paterson and Phil Godman. At one point they trailed by just six points but a Danny Care drop-goal and late Mathew Tait try saw England home and finish runners-up in the Six Nations for the second year running.\nEngland began their summer with a 26–33 defeat to the Barbarians at Twickenham. Iain Balshaw scored from Josh Lewsey's kick-through and Chris Jack ran in a second for the Baa-Baas, with Ben Foden pulling a try back for England. Three tries in 10 minutes after the restart by Rocky Elsom, Balshaw and Gordon D'Arcy increased England's woes. But the home side finished strongly as Andy Goode set up late tries for Jordan Turner-Hall, Tom May and Matt Banahan.\nDelon Armitage scored two tries as England produced an encouraging display to beat Argentina 37–15 at Old Trafford in their first Test. Juan Martin Hernandez's drop-goal put the Pumas ahead but a brace of drop goals and penalties by Andy Goode and a Matt Bahanan try put England in charge. Hernandez continued to punish England at every chance before Danny Care and Mark Cueto set up Armitage to score. In the final minute Armitage scored again, touching down after Cueto's audacious volleyed kick-through.\nBut Argentina survived England's second-half fightback to level the series 1–1 in the second and final Test in Salta. The Pumas scored after two minutes through Juan Manuel Leguizamon, while three Juan Martin Hernandez penalties gave Argentina a 14–3 half-time lead. The hosts stretched clear with a converted try from wing Gonzalo Camacho before Andy Goode landed four kicks. Hernandez responded with a drop-goal which proved the difference after Matt Banahan's converted late try.\nIn the Autumn of 2009, to open their autumn season, Australia produced a dominant second-half performance to beat England for the second time in a row at Twickenham. The returning Jonny Wilkinson opened the scoring with an early drop-goal for England and he soon added a penalty. Australia hit back through a Will Genia try but a second Wilkinson penalty made it 9–5 at the break. The Wallabies then took control and two Giteau penalties and a converted Adam Ashley-Cooper try ensured they started their Grand Slam tour with a victory.\nNext up was Argentina. England needed a late try from Matt Banahan to beat a dogged Argentina side and prevent a sluggish autumn campaign from unravelling at Twickenham. An error-strewn display was lacking in ingenuity and invention but Martin Johnson's side escaped with a victory. Jonny Wilkinson's boot allowed England to go to the break at 9–9, with Martin Rodriguez replying for the Pumas. A tense second half was scoreless until Banahan's 69th-minute try gave England a win they scarcely deserved. And with New Zealand the next visitors to Twickenham, England could take little comfort from another dismal display.\nA much-improved performance from England was not enough to prevent New Zealand pulling away in the second half to win with some ease at Twickenham. Two penalties apiece from Dan Carter and Jonny Wilkinson made it 6–6 after an even first half on Saturday. But the All Blacks then upped their game and, after Carter had edged the All Blacks ahead with a third penalty, Jimmy Cowan scored the decisive try. Carter converted and added a late penalty to guide the All Blacks home.\nEngland began their Six Nations campaign in 2010 with a 30–17 win over Wales at Twickenham. Jonny Wilkinson and Stephen Jones landed a penalty each before tries from James Haskell and Danny Care either side of half-time put England 20–3 up. Wales hit back with a try from Adam Jones and James Hook's solo effort with nine minutes left gave them hope. But Haskell's second try took England clear before Wilkinson's late penalty.\nTheir winning run continued when they beat Italy 17–12 in Rome. A brace of penalties apiece from Jonny Wilkinson – who missed three kicks in all – and Mirco Bergamasco made it 6–6. Mathew Tait's fine try early in the second half put England ahead before Wilkinson slotted his third penalty. Italy trimmed the lead through two Bergamasco penalties, but Wilkinson's drop-goal soothed England nerves.\nIn Week 3 their campaign took a dent with a 16–20 loss at home to Ireland. Ireland took the lead through Tommy Bowe's early try and a penalty from Johnny Sexton, to two from Jonny Wilkinson, gave the Irish an 8–6 half-time lead. A Keith Earls try saw Ireland lead by seven points before Wilkinson converted Dan Cole's try to make it 13–13. Wilkinson then put England ahead with a drop-goal but Bowe's late try and Ronan O'Gara's conversion saw Ireland home.\nWeek 4 saw a trip to Edinburgh to take on Scotland at Murrayfield – the match ended in a 15–15 tie with England retaining the Calcutta Cup. Dan Parks kicked the Scots into a 9–6 half-time lead with two penalties and a drop-goal. Three penalties from Jonny Wilkinson, who then went off injured, made it 9–9 soon after the restart. And two penalties apiece from Toby Flood and Parks ensured the sides could not be separated in a tense finale.\nTo finish their Six Nations, England travelled to Paris to take on a France team who were in search of their ninth Grand Slam. Les Bleus duly delivered, beating England 12–10 in a close fought encounter. A Francois Trinh-Duc drop-goal gave France the lead but England went in front when Ben Foden finished off a fine move to claim his first Test try. Toby Flood converted but three Morgan Parra penalties gave France a 12–7 half-time lead. England dominated the second half but could only manage a Jonny Wilkinson penalty and France held on.\nEngland began the summer of 2010 with another match against the Barbarians at Twickenham, which they won 35–26. England were helped into an early 20–0 lead by converted tries from James Haskell and Shontayne Hape. Paul Sackey crossed for the Baa-Baas before Ben Foden and Mike Tindall made it 32–7 just after the break. But the Baa-Baas hit back and scores from David Smith, Census Johnston and Sackey had England alarm bells ringing.\nEngland then headed Down Under for a summer tour of Australia. They began their tour with a game in Perth v the Australian Barbarians. England escaped with a draw in their first tour game after Wallaby wonderkid James O'Connor had threatened to guide the Australian Barbarians to victory. The 19-year-old scored a superb hat-trick and kicked 10 points after two Olly Barkley penalties had given England an early 6–0 lead in Perth. A Lee Mears try interrupted O'Connor's treble, before Dan Ward-Smith and Matt Banahan gave England a late 28–25 lead. But Berrick Barnes kicked one penalty and missed another in a tense finish. He could have handed England a dispiriting defeat, but his long-range penalty on the final whistle drifted wide as the match ended 28–28.\nEngland's pack threatened to earn them a remarkable victory in the first Test but Australia held on to win in Perth despite being butchered in the scrum. Converted tries from Rocky Elsom and Quade Cooper gave the Wallabies a well-deserved 14–0 lead at half-time. But England hit back through a Toby Flood penalty and a penalty try. Cooper then scored his second try and although England's scrum earned them a second penalty try, two late penalties ensured Australia took the spoils.\nTwo late Olly Barkley penalties helped England's second string to beat the Australian Barbarians and claim the first win of their tour down under. Two Charlie Hodgson penalties put England ahead before three by Berrick Barnes gave the hosts the lead. Barkley drew England level then his late double sealed an unconvincing win.\nEngland earned their first significant victory of Martin Johnson's managerial tenure as they edged a pulsating second Test in Sydney to level the series 1–1. The visitors led 15–13 at half-time after first Test tries for scrum-half Ben Youngs and wing Chris Ashton.\nMatt Giteau replied with two tries for the hosts either side of the interval. But penalties from Toby Flood and his replacement Jonny Wilkinson put England back in front, and they survived two Giteau missed penalties to squeak home.\nEngland came up narrowly short in the final match of their summer tour as they succumbed to the power of the New Zealand Maori in Napier. Two Charlie Hodgson penalties and a Steffon Armitage try put England 13–0 up but the Maori replied through Hosea Gear and Liam Messam to lead 17–13. England hit back with tries from Danny Care and Chris Ashton before half-time. But they failed to score again as Gear powered over for two more tries and Willie Ripia's two penalties sealed it.\nIn the Autumn, England's latest revival showed signs of life at Twickenham but they still slipped to their ninth defeat in a row against the All Black juggernaut. Converted tries from Hosea Gear and Kieran Read put New Zealand 14–0 up. Two penalties apiece from Toby Flood of England and the visitors' Dan Carter made it 20–6 soon after half-time. The home side got in touch through a converted Dylan Hartley try but despite a third Flood penalty, two Carter kicks kept the All Blacks at arm's length.\nEngland produced a scintillating performance at Twickenham to secure a deserved 35–18 victory over Australia. Chris Ashton scored a try in each half, the second a 90m dash to the line for one of the great Twickenham scores. Outside-half Toby Flood kicked seven penalties and two conversions to end the match with 25 points, a record for an Englishman against the Wallabies. Australia full-back Kurtley Beale scored two second-half tries, but an England win was never really in doubt.\nEngland followed their victory over Australia with a solid 26–13 win over a stubborn Samoa side at Twickenham. Behind to two Toby Flood penalties at the break, the visitors moved 8–6 ahead as Paul Williams coasted in out wide. The hosts mustered a swift response as centre Matt Banahan crossed from Chris Ashton's pass and Flood converted. Flood's boot provided another two penalties before Tom Croft strolled in from Banahan's intercept, while Samoa's Fautua Otto scored a late consolation.\nEngland's new-found optimism was dented by a ruthless South African performance as their autumn international campaign ended in defeat at Twickenham. The hosts were fortunate to be 6–6 at half-time, courtesy of Toby Flood, as South Africa dominated but managed only two Morne Steyn penalty kicks. Steyn extended the lead before tries from Willem Alberts and Lwazi Mvovo put the world champions 21–6 in front. In the final minutes, Ben Foden went over after making an interception.\n2011.\nWing Chris Ashton scored two tries as England kicked off the Six Nations with a hard-fought win in a compelling encounter in Cardiff.\nIt was England's first tournament win in the Welsh capital since their 2003 Grand Slam before the World Cup. Ashton went over either side of the break, which saw England leading 13–6, and Toby Flood kicked 13 points. Morgan Stoddart's converted try and a James Hook penalty made it 19–23 but Jonny Wilkinson's penalty sealed it. The World Cup winner came on as a replacement for man-of-the-match Flood with 13 minutes left, and helped the visitors close out victory to underline their status as the world's fourth-ranked nation.\nChris Ashton became the first England player to score four tries in a Five/Six Nations match since 1914 as his side thumped Italy at Twickenham. Ashton claimed his first after three minutes, celebrating with a trademark dive over the line. England cut loose at the end of the half, Ashton, Mark Cueto and Mike Tindall all crossing before the break. Danny Care, James Haskell and Ashton (twice) scored in the second half as England recorded an impressive victory.\nEngland gave their Grand Slam hopes a major boost as they ended defending champions France's eight-match winning streak in the Six Nations. Toby Flood kicked England into a 9–3 lead but Dimitri Yachvili's boot made it 9–9 at the break. Ben Foden's try saw England go back in front before Jonny Wilkinson resumed his position as the leading Test points scorer with a penalty.\nEngland moved within one victory of a first Grand Slam since 2003 but they took time to see off battling Scotland. A tight first half ended 9–9, with three Toby Flood penalties cancelled out by two Chris Paterson penalties and a Ruaridh Jackson drop-goal. Flood put England 12–9 up as Scotland lost John Barclay to the sin-bin. England added a converted Tom Croft try and although Max Evans grabbed a converted try for the Scots, Jonny Wilkinson's penalty confirmed victory.\nIreland destroyed England's Grand Slam hopes but the visitors won the Six Nations after France beat Wales in Paris in the tournament's final match. Three Jonathan Sexton penalties gave Ireland an early 9–0 lead which they extended as Tommy Bowe scythed over. Toby Flood kicked a penalty for England but Ireland led 17–3 at half-time. Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll broke the championship try-scoring record with his 25th try before Steve Thompson collected a consolation score.\nThe Barbarians conjured a superb last-minute try to condemn a youthful England side to defeat in a non-cap international at Twickenham. Tries from Henry Trinder, Ugo Monye and James Simpson-Daniel helped the hosts into a 24–7 lead after 26 minutes. But the Baa-Baas hit back with four unanswered tries to lead 31–24 before England responded with a penalty from Charlie Hodgson and a Tom Johnson try. But Baa-Baas wing Tim Visser finished off a flowing move to win it late on. It was a second try for the Edinburgh-based Dutchman, as the invitational side out-scored England six-to-four on the try count.\nEngland survived a Welsh second-half recovery to inch to victory in both sides' opening World Cup warm-up match at Twickenham.\nJonny Wilkinson's early penalty put England ahead but Wales led 7–3 after a well-worked try for George North. A close-range score from James Haskell and a Wilkinson drop-goal saw the hosts lead 13–7 at the interval, before Manu Tuilagi's debut try put England in command. Shane Williams reduced Welsh arrears before Wilkinson's second drop-goal, but North's second try late on ensured a tense finish.\nJames Hook scored the crucial try as Wales beat England in a pulsating if error-strewn World Cup warm-up clash at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium. Wales, who lost Gavin Henson to injury, led 6–3 after two Rhys Priestland penalties but Toby Flood levelled it. England dominated either side of half-time but failed to unlock Wales' defence, only managing another penalty. Wales picked themselves up to score with Hook's try just before the hour and he landed two penalties to seal it.\nEngland gave themselves a confidence boost a fortnight before the World Cup as they condemned Ireland to a fourth straight warm-up defeat. An early Manu Tuilagi try and two Jonny Wilkinson penalties saw England lead 13–9 at half-time, Ronan O'Gara landing three kicks in reply. With Chris Ashton in the sin-bin, England stretched their lead with a Delon Armitage try.\nEngland's World Cup group contained Argentina, Scotland, Georgia and Romania.\nScrum-half Ben Youngs spared England a stunning World Cup defeat as his try pipped Argentina in Dunedin. Martin Johnson's side were 9–3 down with 13 minutes left when the replacement scooted under the posts. Jonny Wilkinson, who missed five kicks, including four in a row, converted to put England in front. He added a late penalty, while Argentina missed six kicks as they failed to punish England's indiscipline.\nEngland beat Georgia in their Pool B World Cup match in Dunedin but the stuttering nature of the performance will be of concern to manager Martin Johnson. Georgia, ranked 16th in the world, dominated the breakdown before half-time and forced England into a host of infringements, but fly-half Merab Kvirikashvili missed three penalties. Centre Shontayne Hape scored two tries for England before the break, while Georgia number eight Dimitri Basilaia touched down to make it 17–10 at half-time. But England's superior fitness told in the second half, with Delon Armitage, Manu Tuilagi and Chris Ashton (two) going over for tries to secure a bonus-point win.\nEngland put themselves within sight of the World Cup quarter-finals with a comfortable bonus-point victory over Romania in Dunedin.\nMark Cueto scored a first-half hat-trick and fellow wing Chris Ashton a brace to put them 34–3 up at the break. Ashton completed his hat-trick after the restart as England ran in 10 tries in all in a much-improved performance.\nEngland stumbled into the World Cup quarter-finals and almost certainly put Scotland out after an error-ridden victory at Eden Park.\nScotland needed a victory by eight points to have a realistic chance of progressing to the knock-out stages, and for long periods of a ferocious contest looked as if they might pull it off. But two penalties and a drop-goal from Jonny Wilkinson, despite a host of other wayward attempts, plus a late try from Chris Ashton were enough to send a misfiring England through.\nEngland's World Cup dreams fell apart under a French onslaught on a night when their shortcomings were brutally exposed at the quarter-final stage. First-half tries from Vincent Clerc and Maxime Medard opened a lead of 16 unanswered points as England shipped penalties and made basic errors across the park. England struck back with a fine try from Ben Foden and closed to within seven points with three minutes left when Mark Cueto capitalised on a break from replacement Matt Banahan. But they ran out of time and inspiration as Les Bleus set up a deserved semi-final clash with Wales.\nMartin Johnson stepped down from the role of head coach on 16 November 2011. He was duly replaced by Stuart Lancaster on 8 December 2011.\n2012.\nEngland's new-look side gave interim coach Stuart Lancaster the best possible start by claiming a first win at Murrayfield in eight years. Charlie Hodgson's charge-down try at the start of the second half plus eight points from the boot of debutant Owen Farrell left Scotland ruing a series of blown try-scoring chances. England's inexperienced players came through their baptism of fire with great fight and resolve, despite waves of Scottish pressure. Dan Parks landed two penalties but dithered with his clearing kick to hand Hodgson and England the softest of tries and the perfect start to their Six Nations campaign.\nEngland's new-look side wriggled off the hook with an impressive second-half comeback to deny Italy's Azzurri their first ever victory over the red rose. Two tries in two minutes from Giovanbattista Venditti and Tomasso Benvenuti, courtesy of England errors, had gifted Italy a 15–6 lead and threatened to make Six Nations history. But a second charge-down try in eight days from Charlie Hodgson and four penalties from the nerveless Owen Farrell dragged Stuart Lancaster's men back from the brink.\nWales seized their 20th Triple Crown in dramatic fashion after a hugely controversial ending to a gripping contest at Twickenham.\nScott Williams' brilliant steal, kick-ahead and try with five minutes remaining put Wales ahead for the first time after four penalties apiece from Owen Farrell and Leigh Halfpenny had the teams locked together at 12–12. With time up, replacement Mike Brown put David Strettle over on the right but after several minutes of deliberation, television match official Iain Ramage ruled the winger had failed to ground the ball.\nEngland took revenge for their World Cup quarter-final defeat and produced by far the best display of interim coach Stuart Lancaster's young revolution with a nerve-shredding victory in Paris. Tries in the first 20 minutes from Manu Tuliagi and Ben Foden helped England to a 14–3 lead but France, with penalties from fly-half Lionel Beauxis, scrum-half Julien Dupuy and his replacement Morgan Parra, came roaring back to within two points at 15–17. Tom Croft's fine solo try and Owen Farrell's dead-eyed conversion then looked to have made the game safe, only for a late try for the outstanding Wesley Fofana to again bring France within range of a remarkable win. But Francois Trinh-Duc's last-gasp drop-goal attempt fell just short and England were left celebrating their fifth victory in their last six Six Nations matches against Les Bleus.\nEngland produced a dominant forward display to steamroller Ireland and finish second in the Six Nations table in coach Stuart Lancaster's first campaign in charge. Six penalties from the boot of Owen Farrell and an inevitable penalty try were a fitting reward as England's pack destroyed their opposite numbers at the scrum. Ireland had been within three points at half-time as Jonny Sexton punished England indiscipline, but the visitors were dismantled in a one-sided second half. Replacement Ben Youngs sealed the win with an opportunistic darting run from a tap penalty as the wheels came off the Ireland set-piece in the last quarter.\nSouth Africa overpowered a game England to win the first Test of the three-match series in Durban. For 40 minutes England held their own against a side that had only five days to prepare for the contest. The score was 6–6 at the break but after the restart the Springboks increased the physicality. Tries from Morne Steyn and Jean de Villiers effectively secured the match for the hosts and a late touch-down by Ben Foden was a mere consolation.\nSouth Africa withstood a brave second-half fightback from England to clinch a series victory in a thrilling encounter in Johannesburg. All hope seemed lost for the visitors as tries from Willem Alberts, Bismark du Plessis and Francois Hougaard gave the hosts a 25–10 half-time lead. Two opportunist converted tries from the lively Ben Youngs dragged England back to within a converted try. But a wonderful try from JP Pietersen secured a nail-biting win for his team.\nEngland earned a creditable draw in Port Elizabeth in the final Test of the series to end a run of nine straight defeats by the Springboks. An early penalty from Toby Flood and Danny Care's try from a quick tap penalty gave England an 8–3 advantage. Morne Steyn's three penalties gave the hosts a 9–8 half-time lead before Owen Farrell's penalty on the resumption. JP Pietersen's try made it 14–11, but Farrell levelled matters before missing a last-gasp, long-range drop-goal.\nEngland outclassed Fiji in a seven-try rout to record a comprehensive victory in their opening autumn international. Two tries from winger Charlie Sharples and 18 points from the boot of Toby Flood opened up a commanding lead before second-half scores from Tom Johnson, Ugo Monye and two from Manu Tuilagi punished the weary tourists.\nEngland's rebuilding process under Stuart Lancaster suffered a significant setback as Australia's under-fire side held on for a narrow but deserved win. Fifteen points from the boot of the impressive Berrick Barnes and a first-half try from Nick Cummins secured victory for the Wallabies.\nEngland slipped to a second chastening narrow defeat of the autumn as a disciplined South Africa held them at bay in a frantic, contentious finale. Two penalties apiece from Toby Flood and his replacement Owen Farrell brought England to within four points after Pat Lambie's boot and Willem Alberts' fortuitous try had opened up a 10-point Springbok lead. But England's efforts ended in controversy when they opted to kick a late penalty rather than go for the try that would have put them in front. While Farrell landed the three points there was insufficient time to mount another attack, and a more battle-hardened, streetwise Springbok unit had the win.\nEngland pulled off one of the great victories in their history as they destroyed world champions New Zealand at a rejoicing Twickenham. The All Blacks had been unbeaten in 20 matches but were completely outplayed as second-half tries from Brad Barritt, Chris Ashton and Manu Tuilagi snuffed out a brief comeback. Three penalties and a drop-goal from Owen Farrell gave England a 15–0 lead after 42 minutes, only for tries from Julian Savea and Kieran Read to make it 15–14. But there was no denying a hugely impressive England, who secured their first win over the All Blacks in nine years – only their seventh in history. Stuart Lancaster's men were superior in every department; their scrum excellent, their breakdown immense and their defence relentless.

superior scrum and forward power in the loose made up for a disjointed display elsewhere.\nEngland tuned up for next week's game against world champions New Zealand with a comfortable 31–12 victory over Argentina at Twickenham.\nHowever, while England started brightly, their second-half performance gave reasons for concern.\nWith England's forwards providing a solid platform and quick ball, Joe Launchbury, Billy Twelvetrees and Chris Ashton scored first-half tries.\nBut England were poor after the restart until replacement Ben Morgan scored a late try as a capacity crowd was reduced to virtual silence at times.\nEngland's superb fightback ended in defeat as their bid to repeat last year's stirring win over the All Blacks came up short in the face of the all-round class of the world champions.\nThe hosts took the lead for three minutes around the hour mark but New Zealand hit back immediately to stay on course for a perfect year after a 13th straight Test victory of 2013.\nEarly tries from wing Julian Savea and number eight Kieran Read saw the All Blacks establish a commanding 17–3 lead.\nBut England's forward power yielded a try for lock Joe Launchbury and five penalties from Owen Farrell saw them recover to lead 22–20.\nThe world champions showed their quality though to manufacture a third try – Savea's second – and Aaron Cruden's penalty kept England at arm's length in the closing exchanges.\n2014.\nA last-gasp try from France replacement Gael Fickou denied England what would have been their biggest ever comeback win in a sensational start to the 2014 Six Nations.\nHaving conceded a try in the first minute and been 16–3 behind with barely a quarter of the contest gone, England had fought back superbly to lead 24–19 with just four minutes left.\nMike Brown's first Test try and another for debutant Luther Burrell came amid 18 unanswered points as early French dominance gave way to English ascendancy deep into the second half.\nBut with the home crowd reduced to near silence France conjured up one final attack to send the Stade de France into glorious uproar and hand England only their third Six Nations defeat of Stuart Lancaster's tenure.\nA

for both in two championship matches – were the reward for an assured performance as Scotland failed to score a single point.\nEngland ended Ireland's Triple Crown ambitions and blew the Six Nations title race wide open as they fought back to edge one of the great Twickenham battles.\nRob Kearney's beautifully worked try had given Ireland a seven-point lead early in the second half before Danny Care replied with a thrilling score of his own to steal it back.\nOwen Farrell, who had earlier notched two penalties, then landed the conversion before a titanic final quarter saw both sides reduced to stumbling exhaustion by the relentless pace.\nEngland seized their first Triple Crown in 11 years and set up a tilt at the Six Nations title as they out-ran and out-fought reigning champions Wales at Twickenham.\nIn balmy spring sunshine, England ran in first half tries from Danny Care and Luther Burrell, only for five penalties from the faultless Leigh Halfpenny to keep the score to 20–15 at the break.\nBut similar kicking excellence from Owen Farrell punished an error-strewn Welsh performance as Stuart Lancaster's rapidly developing side produced another display of rich promise.\nEngland failed to beat Ireland to the Six Nations title despite a thumping victory over an error-ridden Italy.\nThey fell short of the required 51-point winning margin, meaning Ireland's win over France in Paris secured the Championship.\nBut they ended their campaign on a high after running in seven tries against a side which had held them to a combined margin of 13 points in their previous three victories in Rome.\nTwo tries from the exceptional Mike Brown and one apiece for Owen Farrell, Jack Nowell, Manu Tuilagi, Mako Vunipola and skipper Chris Robshaw blew the disappointing hosts away,

champions as Conrad Smith's last-gasp try gave them a dramatic win.\nEngland took a 9–3 lead through the boot of Freddie Burns.\nBut Aaron Cruden's kicking kept the hosts in it and it was 15–15 with two minutes remaining and Marland Yarde in the sin-bin for England.\nThe hosts spurned a kickable penalty but Smith dived over to secure victory.\nIt was a thrilling end to a gripping Test and means the hosts' 20-year unbeaten run at Auckland's Eden Park continues.\nNew Zealand put in a fine second-half performance to beat England in the second Test in Dunedin and clinch the three-match

team.\nEngland fell to their fifth consecutive defeat as South Africa profited from another disappointing display.\nTrailing by 14 points early in the second half, England responded with back-to-back

one-sided nature of what was expected to be a tight contest.\nEngland were outplayed in all departments, starting slowly, consistently second-best at the breakdown and all too fallible under the high ball until a late rally.\nAfter all the optimism engendered from their unbeaten start to the Six Nations this will go down as one of the most chastening defeats of Stuart Lancaster's regime.\nError-strewn England set up a three-way fight for the Six Nations title with Wales and Ireland on the final weekend as they finally put away a dogged Scotland to retain the Calcutta Cup.\nThe

hunt for their first title in four years.\nEngland fell one try short of a first Six Nations title in four years as they out-ran France in a sensational 12-try contest.\nNeeding to win by 26 points to deny Ireland, they attacked relentlessly in a chaotic, thrilling match and so nearly pulled off a remarkable win.\nA brace of tries apiece from Ben Youngs and Jack Nowell plus scores from Anthony Watson, George Ford and Billy Vunipiola saw them pile up their highest ever score against France, while the visitors' total was only the second time in Six Nations history that a team has scored 30 points or more and lost.\nEngland survived a pounding up front to beat France in their opening World Cup warm-up game at Twickenham.\nThe hosts took an early 12–3 lead after two stunning Anthony Watson tries.\nBut the strength of France's pack gave Morgan Parra the chance to kick two penalties to make it 12–9 at the break.\nA superb Jonny May try saw England pull clear again and although the power of the French saw them cut the margin to five points as Fulgence Ouedraogo drove over from a maul, the hosts held on.\nFrance dealt England's World Cup plans a blow as for 70 minutes they battered a side widely believed to be close to Stuart Lancaster's favoured XV. Frederic Michalak's boot saw the hosts lead 15–6 at half-time, George Ford landing two penalties for England.

But England came alive and late tries from Danny Cipriani and Jonathan Joseph made it close on the scoreboard.\nEngland went into their home World Cup in winning fashion after they eased past Ireland at Twickenham. Jonny May and Anthony Watson tries put England 12–3 up before May had a try disallowed for a forward pass.

Despite a stuttering opening display, England had a platform on which to build as they sought to win the Webb-Ellis trophy for the first time in 12 years.\nWales overcame a 10-point deficit and endless injuries to pull off a sensational win against England in an astonishing World Cup contest.\nGareth Davies's late try from Lloyd Williams' brilliant cross-field kick and 23 points from Dan Biggar's unblemished boot sealed victory.\nThis is a devastating loss for England, for whom Owen Farrell kicked 20 points. Jonny May scored a first-half try for the hosts, who turned down a tricky late shot at goal and paid the price.\nThe late defeat left England needing to win their next pool match against old enemies Australia to maintain any chance of reaching the quarter-finals.\nEngland were knocked out of the World Cup after being torn apart by a superb Australia display at a stunned Twickenham. Two converted first-half tries and four penalties from Wallaby fly-half Bernard Foley in a virtuoso display brought a richly deserved win on a black night for England's men in white.\nOne week later, England's doomed World Cup campaign ended with a few fireworks as they ran in 10 tries to complete an ultimately hollow final victory against Uruguay, winning 60–3 in Manchester.\nFollowing a subsequent RFU inquest into England's shortcomings at the tournament, coach Stuart Lancaster had his contract terminated with immediate effect. Though his win rate in matches as coach was the highest since Sir Clive Woodward, his failure to secure the Six Nations title at all in his tenure, coupled with the team's exit at the pool stage, effectively made his position as coach untenable.\n2016.\nLancaster was succeeded as head coach by Eddie Jones, who had masterminded Japan's historic triumph over South Africa at the 2015 Rugby World Cup. Jones was thus the first ever foreign coach in the national team's history. Upon his appointment, Jones dismissed Lancaster's former coaching assistants, Following Jones' public criticism of captain Chris Robshaw during the World Cup, he was stripped of the captaincy. Dylan Hartley then succeeded Robshaw as skipper.\nJones' England began their Six Nations campaign away to Scotland.\nScotland's wait to regain the Calcutta Cup goes on after England opened the Eddie Jones era with victory away at Murrayfield. Four months on from a disastrous World Cup campaign on home soil, England established an early lead through George Kruis' converted try, but were then pegged back by the boot of Greig Laidlaw to make it 7–6 at half-time. But after the hosts failed to capitalise on several promising openings, English strength from the bench helped establish a grip on what had been a messy affair. Jack Nowell finished off a well-worked try and Owen Farrell landed his second penalty, and with their forwards increasingly in control, England closed the game out in comfort.\nEddie Jones's unbeaten start to his England coaching career continued with a win over Italy in Rome that started slowly but ended at pace. A disjointed first half was enlivened by George Ford's try off turnover possession, although Carlo Canna's boot kept the Azzurri within a score. But two quick tries from Jonathan Joseph, his fifth and sixth in his past seven Six Nations matches, calmed English anxieties. And the Bath centre completed his hat-trick with a powerful run into the left-hand corner before Owen Farrell gathered Jamie George's classy offload to score England's fifth try.\nEddie Jones's perfect start as England coach continues as his new side made it three Six Nations wins from three with a battling victory over Ireland. Conor Murray's try had given the visitors a narrow lead early in the second half after England had dominated territory and possession but failed to convert it into points. But two tries in five minutes from Anthony Watson and Mike Brown snatched back control of what had been a tight, error-strewn match. And ferocious, often last-ditch defence then kept waves of Irish attacks at bay and left Jones's men top of the championship table.\nEngland went to Paris with a Grand Slam in their sights after hanging on against a resurgent Wales to secure the Triple Crown in an epic encounter. England won their first Six Nations title since 2011 despite a dramatic finale that so nearly cost them dear at Twickenham. A first-half try from Anthony Watson and three penalties from Owen Farrell established a 16–0 half-time lead as the hosts took control. A charge-down try from Dan Biggar gave Wales hope but, with Maro Itoje outstanding, Farrell's boot appeared to have calmed any nerves left from the infamous collapse from a similar position in the World Cup last autumn. Two tries in four minutes from George North and Talupe Faletau changed all that, and in the final moments North almost powered free again. But England escaped, and Eddie Jones' first season in charge ended in triumph.\nWith four wins from four, after Scotland beat France on 13 March, England were confirmed as Six Nations champions.\nEngland won their first Grand Slam in 13 years after holding out to secure a historic victory in Paris. First-half tries from Danny Care and Dan Cole had given them a five-point half-time lead, only for the relentless penalty precision of Maxime Machenaud to keep France within touching distance. But a third try in three matches from Anthony Watson calmed rising nerves before a brace of late penalties from Owen Farrell allowed the travelling support to sing their heroes home.\nEngland scored five tries to beat Wales at Twickenham, ahead of 2016's summer southern hemisphere tours.\nRob Evans crossed early for Wales but fine tries from England backs Luther Burrell and Anthony Watson cut the visitors' lead to 13–10 at half-time.\nBen Youngs gave England the lead with a sniping try before Jack Clifford showed good pace to go over from distance and Marland Yarde crossed out wide. England fly-half George Ford missed six out of seven kicks at goal.\nEngland beat the Wallabies for only the fourth time in Australia as they triumphed in a mighty battle in the first Test in Brisbane.\nThe win looked unlikely when they fell 10–0 behind early on as Michael Hooper and Israel Folau scored for the hosts.\nBut the tourists hit back through the boot of Owen Farrell and tries from Jonathan Joseph and Marland Yarde.\nAustralia rallied as Hooper and Tevita Kuridrani crossed, but Jack Nowell had the final word for England.\nEngland produced a heroic defensive display to earn their first series win in Australia with victory in the second Test in Melbourne.\nEngland took a 10–0 lead through Dylan Hartley's try and an Owen Farrell conversion and penalty but Australia hit back via Stephen Moore's try.\nFarrell's second penalty gave England a six-point lead in the second half.\nThey then had to survive relentless Australian attacks before Farrell crossed to wrap up victory late on.\nEngland completed a series whitewash in Australia with victory in a pulsating third and final Test in Sydney.\nThe Wallabies led by a point at half-time courtesy of the boot of Bernard Foley, after Dan Cole and Mike Brown had crossed for England, and Foley and Dane Haylett-Petty for the hosts.\nMichael Hooper and Israel Folau tries cancelled out a Billy Vunipola score.\nBut Owen Farrell's boot kept England in touch and Jamie George's try helped them to a record score and a 3–0 win.\nEngland stretched their perfect record under Eddie Jones to 10 matches as they demolished a weary South Africa at a rain-soaked Twickenham.\nFirst-half tries from Jonny May and Courtney Lawes were matched by a near-identical pair by George Ford and Owen Farrell in the second period to overwhelm the visitors.\nEngland stretched their winning run to 12 matches as they ran in nine tries against Fiji at Twickenham.\nJonathan Joseph, Elliot Daly, Semesa Rokoduguni, Teimana Harrison and Joe Launchbury gave England a big lead.\nFiji hit back as Nemani Nadolo, Leone Nakarawa and Metuisela Talebula scored either side of the break.\nBut further scores from Joe Launchbury (two), Joseph, Alex Goode and Rokoduguni saw England secure their biggest winning margin against Fiji.\nEngland won their 13th match in a row by beating Argentina despite Elliot Daly's red card after less than five minutes at Twickenham.\nWing Daly was dismissed for taking out Leonardo Senatore in mid-air but a penalty try and three Owen Farrell penalties opened up a 16–0 lead.\nTries from Facundo Isa and Santiago Cordero cut the gap to two points.\nA Jonny May score pulled England clear with Argentina's Enrique Pieretto also sent off for a stamp on Joe Marler.\nEngland equalled their record of 14 consecutive Test victories with a 37–21 win over Australia at Twickenham.\nThe Wallabies made a frenzied start, with Sefanaia Naivalu going over for a try and two more being ruled out.\nAustralia gifted Jonathan Joseph a try before two Bernard Foley penalties gave the visitors a deserved half-time lead.\nBut England were excellent after the break, Marland Yarde, Ben Youngs and Joseph touching down for a fourth consecutive win over the visitors.\n2017.\nEngland overcame a disjointed first half and a resurgent France to come from behind and get their Six Nations defence off to a winning start by securing a national record 15th victory in a row.\nEddie Jones' men were fortunate to be level 9–9 at half-time and were four points down with time running out after a fine try from Rabah Slimani.\nBut, kept in touch by Owen Farrell's three penalties and one from Elliot Daly, their strength off the bench gradually seized control of a match that had been slipping away.\nWith their forwards at last making inroads with ball in hand and a tiring defence stretched, Ben Te'o's try finally brought Twickenham to full voice.\nEngland broke Welsh hearts with a late try from Elliot Daly snatching an unlikely victory in Cardiff and stretching their winning run to 16 matches.\nLiam Williams' slicing first-half try and 11 points from the boot of Leigh Halfpenny looked to have sealed a merited home triumph, the Principality Stadium awash in song and celebration.\nDefending Six Nations champions England had led through Ben Youngs' early try but were then bullied for much of a pulsating contest, their callow back row outmuscled and their attack imprecise.\nBut Owen Farrell's penalties kept them within two points and with time running out his long flat pass put Daly away down the left to escape Alex Cuthbert's despairing tackle and dive over in the corner.\nEngland were given a huge scare by Italy before five second-half tries saw them extend their winning run to 17 matches.\nItaly had led 10–5 at half-time, a combination of an extraordinary tactic at the breakdown and the hosts' ineptitude threatening a huge upset at Twickenham.\nBut two quick tries after the break from Danny Care and Elliot Daly calmed nerves, and although Michele Campagnaro's bullocking try made it 17–15 with 20 minutes remaining, another from Ben Te'o and two from replacement Jack Nowell saved England's blushes.\nEngland retained their Six Nations title and equalled New Zealand's world record for consecutive Test wins with a seven-try demolition of sorry Scotland.\nA hat-trick of tries for Jonathan Joseph, and one apiece for replacements Anthony Watson and Billy Vunipola and two for Danny Care put the visitors to the sword at Twickenham as Owen Farrell kicked 26 points.\nIreland wrecked England's Grand Slam dream and ended their world record run of victories with a dramatic win at a rejoicing Aviva Stadium.\nThe home side overwhelmed the Six Nations champions with their intensity and physicality, just as they had in Slam deciders here in 2011 and 2001.\nIn the process they also halted England's winning run at a record 18 Tests, leaving them level with New Zealand, who were also beaten by Ireland to bring to an end their record run back in November.\nA first-half try from Iain Henderson and eight points from the boot of a battered Johnny Sexton established a lead that England never looked like closing, despite Owen Farrell's three penalties.\nA young England side beat the Barbarians in May.\nNathan Earle, Nick Isiekwe and Danny Care scored

of the first half, through Charlie Ewels and Piers Francis, with Joaquin Tuculet's reply helping make it 18–13 to the visitors at the break.\nTries from Pablo Matera and Emiliano Boffelli, with Danny

tries saw them battle to victory in a game featuring several hotly-debated decisions.\nElliot Daly's try early in the second half had built on an early lead established by Owen Farrell's boot. \nJonathan Joseph, Jonny May and the impressive Danny Care all crossed late on as the home side's 'finishers' overwhelmed an exhausted gold-shirted defence.\nEngland made it three wins out of three in the autumn with another late flurry of tries against Samoa. Full-back Mike Brown and centre Alex Lozowski went over early on with Piula Faasalele replying for the visitors at Twickenham.\nCharlie Ewels added England's third try but attacks frequently stalled because of errors and breakdown infringements.\nBut Elliot Daly (two), Henry Slade and Semesa Rokoduguni crossed in the second half with Chris Vui scoring for Samoa.\n2018.\nEngland started and finished in style as they overcame a spirited Italy to begin their Six Nations title defence with a seven-try romp.\nTwo early tries from Anthony Watson set Eddie Jones's men on their way, Owen Farrell adding another after Tommaso Benvenuti's inspired try had narrowed the gap.

Wales kept Eddie Jones' men scoreless in the second half as they clawed their way back into the game and Gareth Anscombe's late penalty put them within a converted try of the hosts, but handling errors and debatable decisions at key moments hurt their chances.\nScotland scored three tries to earn a thrilling first victory over England since 2008 and open up the Six Nations title race at an exultant Murrayfield.\nCentre Huw Jones scored two tries – Scotland's first against England at home in 14 years – and Sean Maitland grabbed another as the hosts led 22–6.\nOwen Farrell landed two penalties, and his converted try on the resumption brought England to within nine points.\nBut Finn Russell's penalty after a Sam Underhill shoulder charge sealed it.\nEngland fell to a second chastening defeat in two matches as Ireland's bonus-point win over Scotland secured the Six Nations title. Eddie Jones' men needed to beat France and score four tries to keep the championship alive, but they came nowhere close in a largely toothless display that belied their status as the world's second-ranked team. A game poised at 9–9 at half-time was blown open when Anthony Watson's high tackle on Benjamin Fall saw the England full-back sent to the sin-bin for 10 minutes and a penalty try awarded. Jonny May's late try gave them hope of an unlikely win, but France held out against a white-shirted onslaught at the death for only their second win in a year. Playing against Ireland at home in Twickenham in the final round, with Ireland chasing a Grand Slam, England again capitulated with a combination of poor handling and aimless attack, with the Irish cruising to victory by 24–15.\nFollowing their fifth-place finish in the Six Nations, England played a non-test match against the Barbarians in preparation for their forthcoming tour. The game ended in a shock defeat for the Red Roses, by 63–45, with overlooked England international Chris Ashton scoring a hat-trick of tries for the Baabaas.\nIn the first match of their summer tour to South Africa, England raced out to a 24–3 lead inside the first 25 mins, before the hosts fought back to lead 29–27 at the break. A fiercely close second half saw the Springboks finally emerge victorious by 42–39. Former England coach Clive Woodward described England's performance as \"a horror-show\", and suggested the team were not developing as quickly as their rivals, despite the quality of play in the first half. The second test would follow a similar pattern, with England surrendering an early lead to lose the game 23–12. The third test, played in miserable slushy conditions at Newlands, saw a reworked England side claim a consolation win by 25–10 against a similarly experimental Springbok line-up. \nWith former All Blacks and USA Eagles coach John Mitchell appointed as their new defence coach, England began their autumn campaign with a tightly contested return victory against South Africa by 12–11, and an equally close loss to world champions New Zealand the following week. Both games were noted for controversial refereeing decisions that were seen to affect the outcome. England then won their remaining games of the autumn against Japan 35–15 and Australia 37–18. The win over Australia represented the completion of a perfect winning record in non-World Cup years over the Wallabies since the appointment of Eddie Jones, and their sixth straight win against the coach's former side since the 2015 World Cup pools.\n2019.\nEngland opened their 2019 campaign well, defeating world number 2 Ireland in style (20-32). They then went on to tear apart a sorry France side at Twickenham a week later (44-8), but their Grand Slam hopes were dashed when they lost to Wales in Cardiff (21-13). They bounced back however, to thrash Italy 57-14. The final match against Scotland at Twickenham was a must-win to take back the Calcutta Cup and avoid back-to-back losses to the Scots for the first time since 1984, and to avoid losing to Scotland at Twickenham for the first time since 1983. England ran out to a 31-7 lead in the first half, but Scotland went quick and hard in the second half, leading 31-38 with just four minutes to go. England fought hard, and scored a try to level the game 38-38 at fulltime, but failing to reclaim the Calcutta Cup.\nEngland showed their form well leading up to the World Cup, winning against Wales (33-19), Italy (37-0) and getting a record win over Ireland (57-15) but losing to Wales (13-6). England won their pool comfortably at the World Cup, beating Tonga (35-3), the USA (45-7) and Argentina (39-10). However, their deciding pool match against France was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, and called a draw, so England finished on top regardless. England then went on to thrash Australia in the quarter-finals 40-16, and then pulled off a stunning win against New Zealand in the semi-final (19-7). England were favourites for the World Cup final, where they would be meeting South Africa. England scored their only points from penalties, and lost 12-32 against a dominant Springbok side.\n2020.\n2020 started out poorly for England, after a 24-17 loss to France. But things changed quickly, as England would go on to win the Six Nations with a Triple Crown, beating Scotland (6-13), Ireland (24-12) and Wales (33-30). The final round had to be postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and was played in October, just before the Autumn Nations Cup (which was put in place due to the southern hemisphere teams not being allowed to travel to the northern hemisphere due to COVID-19 protocols) England comfortably won the Six Nations, beating Italy 5-34 in Rome.\nThe Autumn Nations Cup saw England top their group comfortably, beating Georgia (40-0), Ireland (18-7) and Wales (24-13). The final was a hard fought battle against France at Twickenham, which went into overtime with a 19-19 draw. On the 96th minute, Owen Farrell kicked the winning penalty to win England the Autumn Nations Cup.\n2021.\nEngland suffered in the Six Nations of 2021, losing their opening match to Scotland (6-11) at Twickenham, the first time they had lost to Scotland at Twickenham since 1983. They beat a plucky Italian side a week later by 41-18. The next round saw them suffer a record 40-24 defeat to Wales in Cardiff in a game mired in officiating controversy. They met France at Twickenham in the next round, where it seemed like France would win, leading 13-17 at halftime. In the final 5 minutes, France were leading 16-20, and on the 76th minute, Maro Itoje scored the match-winning try for England to win 23-20. However, England would finish 5th in the championship, after Ireland demolished them 32-18. This was the first time England had been beaten by all the Home Nations in one championship since 1976.\nIn the summer tests, England met the USA and Canada, winning comfortably in both games beating the USA (43-29) and Canada (70-14). They got a clean sweep in the November tests as well, defeating Tonga (69-3) and claiming an eighth straight win against Australia (32-15). In the final game, they met world champions South Africa for the first time since they lost in the World Cup final. It was a dramatic match, and in the dying moments South Africa led 24-26, until England were awarded a penalty, which Marcus Smith kicked to win the game for England (27-26)\n2022.\nEngland opened the 2022 Six Nations with a narrow defeat to Scotland at Murrayfield, marking the first time in 38 years that Scotland had defeated England in consecutive matches. England then nilled Italy in Rome with a 0-33 victory before beating Wales 23-19 at Twickenham. England's match against Ireland began with Charlie Ewels receiving the fastest red card in the tournament's history, being dismissed for a high tackle after 82 seconds. Ireland led 9-15 at half-time before England levelled the score to 15-15 after an hour, but two late tries from Ireland gave them their biggest ever victory at Twickenham and assured England could not win the championship. France defeated England 25-13 in the final match of the tournament to win the Grand Slam, with England finishing in third place."

        "text": "Cheng Chih-lung (born 29 August 1969) is a Taiwanese basketball coach and retired basketball player, as well as a former politician as a member of the Legislative Yuan of the Republic of China.\nCheng played small forward for the Chinese Taipei national basketball team and started as shooting guard for his professional clubs in Taiwan's Chinese Basketball Alliance and mainland China's Chinese Basketball Association mostly in the last decade of the 20th century. During his prime, he was widely recognized as one of the best offensive players in Asia. He was also the first Taiwanese player to play in the Chinese Basketball Association. After a brief but controversy-packed political career following his retirement as a player in 2001, Cheng has returned to basketball to coach in Taiwan's Super Basketball League since 2007. (He also coached in China's National Basketball League in 2012.)\nEarly life.\nCheng's biological father returned to the United States before Cheng was born. He was raised by his mother, of Amis descent.\nPlaying career.\nAs a member of the Chinese Taipei youth team, teen-aged Cheng Chih-lung was two-time scoring champion in the FIBA's Under-18 Asian Championship. At the age of 19, he became the then-youngest player on the Chinese Taipei adult team and helped his team to a third-place finish in FIBA Asia Championship 1989—Taiwan's best record in the tournament since its resumption of international sports participation in the mid-1980s. From then through 1999, Cheng played for the national team in various international tournaments and helped set the team's best records in all major tournaments in the region including winning Taiwan's first gold medal in men's basketball in the 1997 East Asian Games. As the representative star player of Taiwan, Cheng was selected to All-Tournament Team for the William Jones Cup international tournament for numerous times and to the FIBA Asian All-Star roster in 1998.\nInitially nicknamed \"Doctor\" after Dr. J by his American coach, John Nealon, due to his jumping ability, Cheng Chih-lung subsequently derived another nickname, \"the Loach-Dragon\" (泥鰍龍), from his shrewd playing style. A stable mid- and long range shooter, Cheng was also acclaimed for his smart offensive running, crafty moves, and great body coordination in the air that enabled him to \"bore\" through the defense like a slippery dojo loach and score from various angles and distances. As a Hung Kuo Elephant, he became the then-highest-paid basketball player in Taiwan and was the cornerstone of the \"Hung Kuo dynasty\" from 1996 through 1998 when the team won three consecutive championships of Taiwan's professional Chinese Basketball Alliance (中華職業籃球聯盟). He was named the most valuable player (MVP) for the 1995–1996 season and for the 1998 championship series where he almost single-handedly brought his team to its third title out of a 1-3 plight in the best-of-seven series against the powerful challenger, the Kaohsiung Mars.\nAfter the Taiwanese professional league, as well as his home club, the Hung Kuo Elephants, came to disbandment due to financial difficulties in 1999, Cheng moved to play for the Shanghai Sharks of the Chinese Basketball Association in mainland China. Teamed up with the then-adolescent Yao Ming, Cheng helped the young Sharks advance to the finals for the first time in franchise history before they were defeated by the nearly invincible Bayi Rockets. First Taiwanese player to join the top-tier Chinese league, Cheng was selected to play in the postseason all-star game and received the league's sporting ethics award. After one rather successful season in China, Cheng returned to Taiwan to play for Dacin Tigers in the amateur Division-A conference (甲組聯賽) where he ended his playing career in the following year (2001).\nAfter retirement as a player.\nUnder the arrangement of his sponsor Wang Jen-ta (王人達), the then-president of the executive board of the Republic of China Basketball Association (中華民國籃球協會) and a political ally of James Soong, Cheng Chih-lung ran for and won the 2001 legislative election as the People First Party (PFP) nominee in the first district of Taipei County. His political career, however, was overshadowed by the scandal of extramarital affair with legislative colleague Kao Chin Su-mei, and public censures for inaction.\nIn the capacity of legislator, nevertheless, Cheng Chih-lung was given the credit of working with the government's Sports Affairs Council to give birth to the Super Basketball League, which started to function in 2003. In the fifth season of the league's existence, Cheng Chih-lung accepted the commission to coach Taiwan Mobile Clouded Leopards and brought the losing team to an improved 15–15 record in the 2009–2010 season."

        "title": "Chronology of Stanley Cup engravings",
        "text": "This article lists a chronology of Stanley Cup engravings.\nA unique feature of the Stanley Cup is that, with few exceptions in the past, it is the only trophy in professional sports that has the name of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff engraved on it, but this has not always been the case as some teams did not engrave their names on the Cup for unknown reasons (which was rectified with a redesign of the Cup in 1948). When he first donated the Cup in 1892, one of Lord Stanley of Preston's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring on the Cup to commemorate their Cup victory (the first year being an exception). Lord Stanley's original trophy was simply a silver bowl minted with the words \"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\" on one side of the outside rim, and \"From Stanley of Preston\" with his family's coat of arms on the other side. The format and location of the engravings, including the addition and deletion of extra bands and rings attached to the bottom of Lord Stanley's original cup/bowl, has changed through the years. By its 125th anniversary in 2017, the Stanley Cup had had 3,177 names engraved on it, of which 1,331 belong to players.\nChallenge Cup Era.\nDuring the Challenge Cup Era from 1893–1914, the Stanley Cup was a \"challenge trophy\"; the champions held onto the Cup until they either lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated the reigning Cup champion in a special game or series.\nTeams had to add their names to the trophy at their own expense. Initially, there was only one ring, the one added by the first Cup champion Montreal HC. Clubs then engraved their team names, usually in the form \"[TEAM NAME] [YEAR WON]\", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no room to engrave their names (perhaps unwilling to pay for a second band to the Cup), teams started leaving their mark on the bowl itself. A second ring was finally added by the Ottawa Senators in 1909. As mentioned earlier in this article, some teams during this era did not engrave their names on the Cup.\n\"(*) Note: The Winnipeg Victorias engraved \"1895\" instead of \"1896\" because they won their Stanley Cup Challenge against Montreal prior to the end of the 1896 season.\nThe \"World Series\" Era.\nBefore the 1914–15 season, a new agreement was reached in which the respective champions of the NHA and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association would face each other for the Cup, similar to baseball's World Series played between the American League and National League champions.\nThis agreement effectively ended the Challenge Cup rule in which a new champion was crowned after it won the title of the previous champion's league. However, the 1915 Ottawa Senators, the 1916 Portland Rosebuds, and the 1918 Vancouver Millionaires all engraved their names on the Cup even though they did not officially win it under the new system.\nThe NHA dissolved in 1917, and the National Hockey League (NHL) took its place. Then after the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) was born in 1921, it was agreed that all three league champions would play for the Cup. The PCHA and the WCHL later merged to form the Western Hockey League (WHL) in 1924.\nThe NHL takes over the Cup, and the \"Stovepipe\".\nThe WHL folded before the 1926-27 season began. As a result, the Cup has since been awarded to the annual NHL champions.\nOnce the Cup became, effectively, the NHL championship trophy, the engraving of the Cup winner's information became a consistent annual tradition. This means that no Cup winning team has been missed since the 1922-23 Ottawa Senators chose to leave their name off the Cup.\nOriginally, a new band was added almost every year, causing the Cup to grow in size. Thus, it became commonly referred to as the \"Stovepipe Cup\" because of its resemblance to the exhaust pipe of a stove. It was also occasionally called the \"cigar\" Cup or the \"elephant's leg\" Cup for similar reasons.\nThe 1948 redesign.\nWith the Stovepipe Cup becoming impractical because of its ever-increasing height, the NHL decided to redesign the trophy.\nThe base of the Stovepipe Cup (all of the bands before the New York Rangers' 1928 ring) was moved back to the top directly under the bowl. A new shoulder collar was added below, onto which only the names of the previous winning teams were engraved. This new shoulder includes all winning team names only. The 1908, 1910 Montreal Wanderers, 1911 Ottawa Senators, 1918 Toronto Arenas, 1922 Toronto St. Pats, 1920, 1921, 1923 Ottawa Senators team names were finally added to the Cup. The cancelled 1919 Stanley Cup Finals was also acknowledged with \"1919/Montreal Canadiens/Seattle Metropolitans/Series Not Completed\". Room was left on the new collar for future teams.\nAll of the 1927–28 to 1945–46 rings from the Stovepipe Cup were redone into nine bands of various heights that were attached below the new collar, forming a vastly expanded barrel-like body. The first 5 rings and half the sixth ring included the winners 1928, 1930 to 1939. There was room to add one more team the sixth band. The 1956 winner was added later. Underneath that was a replica of the wide 1940 band from the Stovepipe Cup, but expanded to allow room for all winners from 1940 to 1951. The 1946–47 Cup champion Toronto Maple Leafs, who had to wait a year because of the redesign, was also added to the wide band. Finally, two more narrow blank bands were added to the bottom of the trophy for the winners 1952 to 1955.\nThe 1957 redesign.\nAs soon as the 1956 Montreal Canadiens added their names to the Cup, all of the various narrow and wide bands of the trophy's barrel were full. Therefore, they were replaced with five symmetrical bands, each of which could contain 13 winning teams. The winning teams and rosters from 1927–28 to 1939–40 were engraved on the first band, the 1940–41 to 1952–53 champions on the second band, and the 1953–54 winners onward on the third band.\nAlthough the bands were originally designed to fill up during the Cup's centennial year, the names of the 1964–65 Montreal Canadiens were engraved over a larger area than allotted (and thus there are 12 teams on that band instead of 13). Also the Cup underwent several minor alterations, namely the retirement of the collar in 1963 and the bowl in 1969 in favor of duplicates because the originals became too brittle.\nThe top ring is retired.\nAfter the bands were finally all filled, the top band of the large barrel, with the 1927–28 to 1939–40 champions, was taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band was introduced at the bottom so the size of the Stanley Cup would not grow further.\nOne year later, the shoulder collar listing the names of the previous winners was also filled to capacity, but it was decided to keep it on the trophy, unchanged in perpetuity. The 1991-92 Pittsburgh Penguins were the last winning team to be engraved on the collar.\nA second ring is retired.\nThe band listing the 1940–41 to 1952–53 Cup winners was scheduled to be retired following the crowning of the 2004–05 champions. However, that season was cancelled because of a labour dispute. The ring was finally taken to the Hockey Hall of Fame one year later after the 2005–06 champion Carolina Hurricanes were crowned. In addition to listing the names of the Hurricanes on the new bottom ring, it was decided to also acknowledge the cancelled 2004–05 season.\nA third ring is retired.\nThe band listing the 1953–54 to 1964–65 Cup winners was retired on October 1, 2018, following the crowning of the 2017–18 champions, the Washington Capitals. \nAfter the Vegas Golden Knights won the Stanley Cup following the 2022–23 season, the names of their players and staff were immediately engraved on the cup prior to the traditional summer player's day with the cup. In previous years, the engraving of players and staff of each champion team took place during the preseason of the succeeding NHL season."

They were able to win a game this time, against Czechoslovakia and they were able to qualify to the second round.\nEgypt's performance at the 1995 Championship rose Egypt to a respectable team. Egypt won all three matches in the first round, beating Brazil, Kuwait and Belarus.

Parker was brought on as a replacement for Webcke, and, as noticed, the Broncos played with 14 men. Parker immediately scored a try following the Webcke incident. An investigation days later stripped the Broncos (who won the match 32–24) of the two competition points gained but an appeal held weeks later saw the two points reinstated.\nParker was the highest point-scorer for the Broncos with a total of 142 points in 2006. He was selected to play from the interchange bench in Brisbane's victory in the 2006 NRL Grand Final. As 2006 NRL Premiers, the Brisbane Broncos travelled to England to face 2006 Super League champions, St Helens R.F.C. in the 2007 World Club Challenge. Parker played at second-row forward, scoring a try and kicking three goals from four attempts in the Broncos' 14–18 loss.\nIn 2007, despite suffering an injury in round one and missing the next eight games, he was again able to finish the season as the Broncos' top point-scorer. In the Broncos' first match of the NRL season 2008, Parker broke the Broncos' club record for most goals in a match, kicking ten from ten. On 26 March 2008, it was announced Parker had re signed with the Brisbane Broncos for a further 3 years. \nAt the start of season 2008, Parker was the first choice kicker for the Broncos, but however, during a knee injury which kept him on the sideline for 6 weeks, the Brisbane Broncos decided to make Michael Ennis the first choice kicker. Following Ennis' move to the Bulldogs at the end of 2008, Parker again became the Broncos' primary goal kicker in 2009.\nFor the 2009 NRL season new Broncos coach Ivan Henjak moved Parker to lock. This proved a success as in April that year he was named in the preliminary 25-man squad to represent Queensland in the opening State of Origin match for 2009. Although he did not make an appearance for the maroons, Parker won the 2009 Paul Morgan Medal as the Broncos' Player of the Year.\n2010s.\nOn 14 May 2010, Parker played his 200th game for the Broncos, becoming the second youngest player to reach the milestone for the club. In September 2010, Corey Parker became captain of the Prime Ministers XIII.\nParker was named the 2011 forward of the year at the Broncos.\nParker played all three games of the 2013 State of Origin series in which Queensland extended their record for consecutive series victories to eight. Parker had made the most offloads out of all players in the 2013 NRL season. Parker was named the 2013 Brisbane Broncos season's player of the year. In the post season, he travelled to Europe with the Australian national team for the 2013 World Cup, helping them reclaim it. In 2013 Corey Parker was awarded International Lock of the Year, The Player's Player award, Most Consistent award, the Best Forward award, Dally M Lock of the Year, and Rugby League Week Player of The Year.\nIn 2014, Parker captained the Brisbane Broncos to the final of the Auckland Nines. In the Auckland Nines, Parker also scored a bonus try against the Roosters. Against the Eels in round 5 of 2014, Parker became the third ever Bronco to reach 1000 points, after Darren Lockyer and Michael De Vere. In May 2014 Corey Parker played in the Trans-Tasman test match for Australia, against New Zealand. Parker suffered an injury in round 13 against the Raiders, which ruled him out of Game 2 of the 2014 State of Origin. He made his return in Game 3 and received Man of the Match. Peter Sterling quoted Parker's Game 3 as being the best performance by a forward in a State of Origin game he has seen. In Round 25 against the Dragons, Parker became the second highest point scorer in Brisbane Broncos history with 1066 points.\nIn Round 1 of the 2015 NRL season, Corey Parker played his 300th NRL game, against the South Sydney Rabbitohs. This made Parker the 22nd NRL player to play 300 games. After the Queensland Maroons 52–6 victory against the New South Wales Blues in the 2015 State of Origin to win the series, Parker was awarded the Wally Lewis Medal. \nIn Round 22 of the 2015 NRL season against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, Parker succeeded Darren Lockyer as the Broncos' highest ever points scorer.\nWithin the weeks leading up to the 2016 NRL season, coach Wayne Bennett announced Parker as the Broncos captain. In June 2016, Parker announced that he would retire from the NRL at years end.\nIn 2020, Parker was announced to make a return for the Brisbane Broncos in the NRL Nines competition\nPost playing career.\nIn 2017, Parker became a sideline commentator for Fox League.\nPersonal life.\nCorey Parker is married to Margaux Parker with their four children (Memphis Parker, Wylei Cash Parker, Jagger Parker and River Monroe Parker).\nHis mother was born in New Zealand."

        "title": "Bobby Grier (American football player)",
        "text": "Robert Grier Sr. (born 1933) is a former college football player for Pitt. In 1956, he was the first African American football player to break the color barrier of the United States collegiate Sugar Bowl game, which was held in New Orleans. Particularly in the deep South, the mid-1950s was a period of strident racial segregation for sports, as well as other areas of life. At the time, Grier's participation in a fullback and linebacker against a segregated all-white team on such a prestigious \"stage\" was a tremendously significant event.\nBiography.\nGrier grew up in Massillon, Ohio and began playing football for the pro team Massillon Tigers his senior year in high school before playing college football at Pittsburgh. Grier later joined the Air Force and worked there for a number of years. He retired from military service to be an administrator at a Pittsburgh community college and is still active in the Pittsburgh community. In 2009, he was named a Washington High School Distinguished Citizen and later added to the Massillon Tiger Wall of Champions. In 2022 Grier's story along with his family was featured in a documentary called Sky Blossom produced by Richard Lui. In October 2022, Bobby Grier was enshrined in Pitt Athletics Hall at Heinz Field. Pitt's Director of Athletics Heather Lyke said, \"Bobby Grier is a richly deserving honoree in our Pitt Athletics Hall of Fame\". Grier and his son are closely involved with the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. His story has been featured on CNBC, History Channel, ESPN, \"The New York Times\", and other media networks.\n1956 Sugar Bowl.\nMuch controversy preceded the 1956 Sugar Bowl, where Grier's Pitt Panthers would meet the Yellow Jackets from Georgia Tech. There was controversy over whether Grier should be allowed to play, and whether Georgia Tech would participate in the contest. Georgia Governor Marvin Griffin was very publicly opposed to racial integration. A measure for the tenor of this time period is the well-known case of Emmett Till being subjected to a lynching in Mississippi, which occurred the previous summer to the 1956 game. Additionally, in the month prior, Rosa Parks ignited the Montgomery bus boycott, where she, in protest, refused to relinquish her seat on a Montgomery, Alabama transit bus.\nA large contingent from the New Orleans community, as well as many connected with Georgia Tech, openly fought to bar either Grier, Pitt, or the Yellow Jacket team from the game. Georgia Tech's president, coach, students, and football players from the Atlanta-based school, civil rights leaders from multiple locales, as well as a large number of the Pitt community, however, succeeded in seeing Grier take to the gridiron that January day.\nIn anticipation of Grier's presence against Georgia Tech, Georgia governor Marvin Griffin in December 1955 publicly sent a telegram to his state's Board Of Regents imploring that teams from Georgia not engage in racially integrated events which had blacks either as participants or in the stands. Georgia Tech's president Blake Ragsdale Van Leer rejected this request. Griffin would later request that President Van Leer and Georgia Tech's players be punished, but Van Leer stuck to his statements, threatened to resign and later received a standing ovation from the faculty senate. Van Leer's stance would typically would not serve an administrator in a Deep South institution well in the 1950s, however the prospect of any long-term professional consequences proved moot since he died of a heart attack only three weeks after the fateful bowl game.\nGeorgia Tech won the game 7-0. The margin of victory mostly resulted from a disputed first quarter 31-yard pass interference penalty which was called on Grier, giving Georgia Tech a first and goal on the Pitt 1-yard line. The Yellow Jackets scored the game's only touchdown on the next play. Photographic evidence later strongly indicated the referee's call was incorrect.\nThe irony of the bad call is that it was made by referee Rusty Coles, from the Pittsburgh area, who had no objective in making the wrong call, but simply made a mistake, which he admitted after seeing the game films.\nGrier finished the game as its leading rusher with 51 yards. After the game, he protested the pass interference call, but praised the Georgia Tech players, saying \"They were good sportsmen, perhaps the best I've played against all season. They played hard, but clean. It was a good game. But believe me. I didn't push that man.\"\nGrier's participation in the 1956 Sugar Bowl, as well as the support he received from various communities, is seen by some experts as a milestone in American race relations.\nIn 2019, Grier was elected as a member of the Sugar Bowl Hall of Fame."

        "title": "List of Stanley Cup challenge games",
        "text": "During the period from 1893 to 1914, the Stanley Cup was a \"challenge trophy\"; the champions held the Cup until they lost their league title to another club, or a champion from another league issued a formal challenge and subsequently defeated them in a special game or series. The competitive format of each challenge was determined by negotiation between the two clubs, and the contesting clubs did indeed make several arrangements during this 22-year period.\nBefore 1912, challenges could take place at any time, given the appropriate rink conditions, and it was common for teams to defend the Cup numerous times during the year. In 1912, the Cup's trustees declared that the Cup was only to be defended at the end of the champion team's regular season.\nAlso during this era, all of the leagues that played for the trophy had no annual formal playoff system to decide their own respective championships; whoever finished in first place after the regular season won the league title. Thus, a few league championship games or series were held just to break first place ties and determine who would keep the Cup. These league title games have historically been listed along with the regular inter-league Cup challenges.\nChampions.\nLord Stanley of Preston introduced the Stanley Cup in 1892 and it was first awarded at the end of winter 1893 to the league champion Montreal Hockey Club (Montreal HC). The same club won a playoff at the end of the 1894 season, which is considered the first \"Stanley Cup challenge\" although four clubs were involved in the process and three teams played games. Montreal HC lost the Cup by losing its league in 1895, decided early in March. The challenge system, as opposed to the Challenge Era, probably truly began sometime thereafter.\nSeason record.\nThis table lists all the champions of the Stanley Cup per hockey season during the challenge era. A season did not have official dates as rinks were natural ice, so season roughly corresponds to winter. The leagues typically started close to the beginning of the calendar year and ended in early March.\nYearly record.\nThis table lists all the champions of the Stanley Cup per year during the challenge era. Annual Stanley Cup Finals series did not begin until 1915, before which time there often were two different champions in a single year, and as many as five different championships.\n1893–94.\nThe first Stanley Cup playoff game occurred on March 17, 1894. At the end of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada season, four teams tied for the AHAC championship with records of 5–3–0. This created problems for the AHAC governors and the Cup's trustees since there was no tiebreaking system in place. After long negotiation and the withdrawal of Quebec from the championship situation, it was decided that a three-team tournament would take place in Montreal, with the Ottawa Hockey Club getting a bye to the finals (being the sole \"road\" team). In the first Stanley Cup playoff game ever, the Montreal Hockey Club defeated the Montreal Victorias, 3–2. Five days later in the first Stanley Cup Finals game, the Montreal HC successfully defended their title with a 3–1 win over Ottawa.\nLater in the year, the Cup trustees accepted a challenge from the squad from Osgoode Hall, the champions of the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). However, the series was eventually cancelled because of the lack of ice.\n1894–95.\nOn March 8, 1895, the Montreal Victorias won the 1895 AHAC title and thus the Stanley Cup, after finishing the season with a 6–2 record. However, a challenge game was scheduled earlier for the next day between the previous year's champion Montreal HC and the squad from Queen's University, which was then part of the Ontario Hockey Association. Thus, it was decided that if the Montreal HC won the challenge match, the Victorias would become the Stanley Cup champions. The Montreal HC would eventually win the game, 5–1, and their crosstown rivals were crowned the champions.\nBilly Barlow, the star player of Montreal was not able to play and Clarence McKerrow took his place. McKerrow had not played any games for Montreal, and could be considered a ringer, but there was no protest from Queen's.\nThe Queen's team, although described as looking fast in their tiger jerseys, were no match for Montreal and the game proved uninteresting.\n1895–96.\nThe first successful challenge to the Cup came in February 1896 by the Winnipeg Victorias, the champions of the Manitoba Hockey Association (MHA). On February 14, Winnipeg beat defending champion Montreal, 2–0, becoming the first team outside the AHAC to win the Cup.\n1896–97.\nThe Montreal Victorias won the 1896 AHAC title by finishing the season with a 7–1 record, and subsequently demanded a rematch for the Cup. However, it was delayed until December 30 due to unsuitable ice conditions in Montreal. In what was said to be the most anticipated hockey game of the time, the Montreal Victorias defeated the Winnipeg Victorias, 6–5, to reclaim the Cup.\n1897–98.\nAnother 7–1 record earned the Montreal Victorias the 1897 AHAC title, and the team subsequently received a challenge from the Ottawa Capitals, champions of the Central Canada Hockey Association (CCHA). It was originally scheduled as the first best-of-three challenge, but the series ended after the first game because the Victorias clearly was the superior team with a 15–2 victory.\nThe Montreal Victorias again won the AHAC championship after finishing the 1898 AHAC season undefeated with an 8–0 record. As a result, no one challenged the Victorias for the Cup.\n1898–99.\nPrior to the start of the 1898–99 season, the AHAC dissolved. The defending Cup champion Montreal Victorias along with several other former AHAC members formed the Canadian Amateur Hockey League (CAHL).\nMontreal then received another challenge from the MHA's Winnipeg Victorias. This time, it was decided that they would play a two-game total goals series in February 1899.\nThe second game ended in controversy. With Montreal leading the game 3–2 with about 12 minutes left in the game, Montreal's Bob Macdougall violently slashed Winnipeg's Tony Gingras. As Gingras was carried off the ice, referee Bill Findlay only called Macdougall for a two-minute minor. Angry that he should have been accessed a larger penalty, Winnipeg went into their dressing room in protest. Insulted, Findlay abruptly went home, but returned after officials followed him on a sleigh and persuaded him to return. Once back at the rink, the referee gave Winnipeg 15 minutes to return to the ice themselves. They refused and thus Findlay disqualified the team and declared Montreal the winners.\nTwo weeks after the Montreal Victorias defeated Winnipeg in their two-game total goals series, they lost the 1899 CAHL title, and thus the Cup, to the Montreal Shamrocks. The Shamrocks compiled a 7–1 season record while the Victorias finished one game back at 6–2. The Shamrocks then played a challenge game against Queen's University on March 14, defeating them 6–2.\n1899–1900.\nThe MHA's Winnipeg Victorias issued another challenge for the Cup. This time, a best-of-three series was played against the defending champion Montreal Shamrocks. Winnipeg won the first game, 4–3, but Montreal prevailed in the next two games, 3–2 and 5–4.\nIn March, the Shamrocks finished the 1900 CAHL season in first place, and thus the league championship, with a 7–1 record and then received another challenge for the Cup. However, the Halifax Crescents of the Halifax City Hockey League (Maritime champions) did not pose much of a threat as Montreal crushed them, 10–2 and 11–0.\n1900–01.\nIn January 1901, the Winnipeg Victorias again challenged the Montreal Shamrocks for the Cup. This time, Winnipeg prevailed, sweeping the best-of-three series with scores of 4–3 and 2–1. Game two was the first overtime game in Cup history with Dan Bain scoring at the four-minute mark of the extra period.\n1901–02.\nIn January 1902, the OHA's Toronto Wellingtons challenged the Winnipeg Victorias for the Cup in a best-of-three series, but Winnipeg swept Toronto in two games with identical 5–3 scores.\nAfter the Montreal HC won the 1902 CAHL title in March, they promptly sent a challenge to the Winnipeg Victorias. In game one of the best-of-three series, Winnipeg shutout Montreal, 1–0. However, Montreal shutout Winnipeg in game two, 5–0, and then held on to a 2–1 victory in game three. With the victory, the Montreal club won the Cup for the first time since 1894. The win earned the players the nickname of \"Little Men of Iron\" for their effort in holding off Winnipeg in the closing moments of game three.\n1902–03.\nAnother Montreal HC vs. Winnipeg Victorias best-of-three challenge series was held in early 1903. In the first game, defending champion Montreal defeated Winnipeg, 8–1. The second game was the first Stanley Cup challenge match to be replayed. Both teams skated to a 2–2 tie before the game had to be suspended at 27:00 of overtime because of a midnight curfew. It was then decided to discard the result and replay the game two days later. In the rescheduled contest, the Victorias won, 4–2, to even the series. However, Montreal won the decisive third game, 4–1, to retain the Cup.\nIn March, the 1903 CAHL season ended with the Montreal Victorias and the Ottawa Hockey Club tied for first place with identical 6–2 records. To determine the CAHL champion, and thus succeed the Montreal HC as the Cup champion, a two-game total goals series was held between the two teams. The first game was held in Montreal ending in a 1–1 tie. The second game was played in Ottawa, with the Ottawas dominating the Victorias, 8–0. The Ottawas thus won the Cup by winning the CAHL.\nAs the new CAHL and Cup champions, the Ottawas accepted a challenge from the Rat Portage Thistles of the Manitoba &amp; Northwestern Hockey Association (MNWHA). Entering the best-of-three challenge series, the Thistles were younger and quicker than Ottawa; only one player on the Thistles was over the age of 20. However, poor soft ice conditions in Ottawa played a major factor as the Ottawas swept the series with scores of 6–2 and 4–2.\nFor their win, the Ottawa players each received a silver nugget from team director Bob Shillington. This is the origin of the nickname of the \"Silver Seven.\"\n1903–04.\nIn January 1904, a best-of-three Cup challenge series was held between the defending champion Ottawa Hockey Club (aka \"Silver Seven\") and the MHA's Winnipeg Rowing Club. Ottawa crushed Winnipeg, 9–1, in the first game but the Rowing Club rebounded with a 6–2 victory in the second. The Silver Seven then won the deciding third game, 2–0. This series marked the first time that goal lines were drawn across the ice from post to post.\nOn January 30, 1904, a CAHL league game between the Ottawas and the Montreal Victorias started late and the game ended at the midnight curfew, with Ottawa leading 4–1. The CAHL ordered the game to be replayed, and the ensuing debate caused the Ottawas to withdraw from the CAHL. The CAHL hoped that without Ottawa, the Cup would remain with the CAHL and be given to its new league champion, the Quebec Bulldogs. However, the Cup trustees decided otherwise, and although the Silver Seven were not affiliated with any league for the rest of the season, they could still receive challenges. About a month later, Ottawa swept a best-of-three Cup series against the OHA's Toronto Marlboros with scores of 6–3 and 11–2.\nIn early March, the Montreal Wanderers of the Federal Amateur Hockey League (FAHL) challenged the Senators for the Cup. In the first game, played in Montreal, the teams played to a 5–5 tie at the end of regulation and the Wanderers refused to play overtime with the current referee. The Cup trustees ordered the series to restart with both games played in Ottawa. However, Montreal refused unless the first game was replayed at home. The Wanderers were disqualified and the Silver Seven retained the Cup.\nA week later, Ottawa HC was challenged by the MNHA's Brandon Wheat City HC, but prevailed in another two game sweep with scores of 6–3 and 9–3.\n1904–05.\nThe Ottawa HC joined the FAHL for the 1904–1905 season.\nOttawa vs. Dawson City.\nIn January 1905, the Ottawas were challenged by the Dawson City Nuggets who travelled 4,000 miles (6,400 km) from the Yukon to Ottawa for a best-of-three Cup challenge series. The Nuggets actually left Dawson City on December 19, 1904 and travelled on a month-long journey by dog sled and walking (Dawson to Whitehorse), ship (Skagway to Vancouver), and train (Whitehorse to Skagway, and Vancouver to Ottawa). Largely because of the long trip, they were no match for the Silver Seven. Ottawa defeated Dawson City in the first game by a score of 9–2. Numerous Stanley Cup records were then set in the second game, including Frank McGee's 14 goals, and a 23–2 rout, the largest margin of victory for any challenge game or Stanley Cup Finals game to date as of 2020.\nOttawa vs. Rat Portage.\nOttawa eventually won the 1905 FAHL title by finishing in first place with a 7–1 record. Then in March, the Rat Portage Thistles issued another challenge to the Ottawas. Although the Thistles crushed Ottawa in the first game, 9–3, Ottawa was without Frank McGee who did not play. However, McGee returned to lead the Ottawas to 4–2 and 5–4 victories in the second and third games to win the series.\nOn the same day that the third game of the Thistles - Ottawa series was played, the 1905 CAHL season ended with the Montreal Victorias winning the title. The Cup trustees accepted their challenge, however, the Montreal-Ottawa series was eventually cancelled because the trustees and the Victorias could not agree on either the game dates or the playoff series format.\n1905–06.\nFor the 1905–06 season, the Ottawa HC (aka \"Silver Seven\") joined the new Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). In February, Ottawa played a best-of-three challenge series against OHA champion Queen's University, but the Senators proved to be the better team as they swept the series with 16–7 and 12–7 victories.\nAbout a week later, Smiths Falls, the FAHL champions, issued a challenge for the Cup, but they suffered the same fate as Queen's University. The Ottawas defeated them with scores of 6–5 and 8–2 to defend the Cup. Ottawa management was so impressed with Smiths Falls goalie Percy LeSueur that they signed him to join the Ottawas a few days after the series ended.\nThe 1906 ECAHA season ended a few days later after the Smiths Falls - Ottawa series, with both Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers tied for first place with identical 9–1 records. It was decided to hold a two-game total goals series to determine the league champion, and thus who would keep the Cup. The first game was played in Montreal where the Wanderers promptly crushed the Ottawas, 9–1. Needing at least an eight-goal victory in the rematch in Ottawa, the newly signed LeSueur was named Ottawa's starting goalie, and the Ottawas jumped to a 9–1 lead to tie the series. But with under 5 minutes to go, Montreal's Lester Patrick scored twice to clinch the series for the Wanderers, winning the total-goals series, 12–10 and taking over the Stanley Cup.\n1906–07.\nIn December 1906, the New Glasgow Cubs, an amateur team from New Glasgow, Nova Scotia, issued a challenge to the Montreal Wanderers. In a two-game total goals series, Montreal easily defeated New Glasgow in both matches, 10–3 and 7–2. This was the first series in which professional players played for the Stanley Cup, as the Wanderers and other teams in the ECAHA were starting to mix amateurs with pros in their squads.\nThe Kenora Thistles (formerly the Rat Portage Thistles before the city changed its name to Kenora in 1904) challenged the Montreal Wanderers for the Cup in January 1907. Aided by future Hockey Hall of Famers Tom Hooper, Tommy Phillips, and Art Ross, the Thistles came away with 4–2 and 8–6 victories for a combined score of 12–8 to win a two-game total goals series. A \"ringer\", Ross was a member of the Brandon Wheat Kings and was borrowed by Kenora just for the challenge games.\nIn March, Kenora would play and win the Manitoba Professional Hockey League (MPHL) playoffs against Brandon to successfully defend the Cup. In a best-of-three, Kenora won 2–0.\nIn March, the Wanderers won the 1907 ECAHA title by finishing the season undefeated with a 10–0 record. Montreal then requested a rematch with Kenora for the Cup. However, there were disagreements between both teams. The Wanderers did not want the Thistles to use their \"ringers\", Harry Westwick and Alf Smith from the Ottawa Senators. Kenora responded by refusing to play, citing the fact that Montreal used \"ringers\" in the earlier series. Eventually, the Wanderers withdrew their protest after the Thistles agreed to play the two-game total goals series in Winnipeg; Winnipeg Auditorium was much larger and thus guaranteed more ticket sales for the clubs to share. In the end, Montreal overcame Westwick and Smith as they compiled a combined score of 12–8 to win the series. Most of the Wanderers' margin-of-victory came in game one as they defeated the Thistles, 7–2. Kenora won game two, 6–5, but the one-goal victory was not enough.\n1907–08.\nAlthough the Montreal Wanderers won the 1908 ECAHA title by finishing the season with an 8–2 record, they played in three Cup challenges that season. In January, they defeated the 1907 FAHL champion Ottawa Victorias, 22–4, in a two-game total goals series. Ernie Russell scored 10 goals as he led the Wanderers to 9–3 and 13–1 victories.\nThe Winnipeg Maple Leafs of the MHL challenged Montreal for the Cup in March, but the Wanderers came away with 11–5 and 9–3 wins to clinch the two-game total goals series, 20–8.\nMontreal's greatest challenge happened two days later when they played a single-elimination game against the Toronto Professional HC. Toronto was the champion of the newly established Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL), and was the first all-professional team to compete for the Cup. However, the Wanderers prevailed, 6–4, with two late goals by Ernie Johnson and Bruce Stuart.\n1908–09.\nIn December 1908, Montreal played its first Cup challenge of the season, this time against the Edmonton Hockey Club of the Alberta Amateur Hockey Association (AAHA). Edmonton entered the series with an all-time high of six \"ringers\". In game one, Harry Smith scored five goals as he led the Wanderers to a 7–3 victory. The Edmontons won game two, 7–6, but Montreal took the two-game total goals series, 13–10.\nPrior to the start of the new season, the Montreal HC and the Montreal Victorias, the last remaining amateur teams, left the ECAHA, and the league dropped \"Amateur\" from its name to become an all-pro league. The 1909 ECHA season ended with the defending Cup champion Montreal Wanderers finishing in second place with a 9–3 record, behind the first place Ottawa HC who finished at 10–2. Thus Ottawa HC won the league championship and were awarded the Cup.\nOttawa received a challenge only from the Winnipeg Shamrocks, but it was too late in the season to set a date.\n1909–10.\nIn an effort to freeze out the Montreal Wanderers, the ECHA disbanded in December 1909 and a new league called the Canadian Hockey Association (CHA) was formed, deliberately designed to exclude the Wanderers. While the Wanderers were forced to join the newly formed National Hockey Association (NHA), the defending Cup champion Ottawa HC still had to accept challenges. In January 1910, they played a two-game total goals series against Galt, champions of the OPHL, but prevailed with 12–3 and 3–1 victories. Marty Walsh led Ottawa with 6 goals.\nSoon after the Galt-Ottawa challenge series ended, the CHA folded because of financial difficulties, and Ottawa was admitted into the NHA. The Senators then played a two-game total goals series against the Edmonton Hockey Club, but Gordie Roberts' seven goals helped Ottawa to victories of 8–4 and 13–7.\nWhen the 1910 NHA season ended in March, the Ottawas had to give the Cup to the Wanderers. Montreal finished in first place with an 11–1 record while Ottawa finished in second place at 9–3. The Wanderers then accepted challenge from the Berlin Dutchmen, who succeeded Galt as the OPHL champions. In the single-elimination game, Ernie Russell scored 4 goals as he led Montreal to a 7–3 win.\n1910–11.\nThe Ottawa HC captured the NHA championship, and thus the Cup, after finishing the 1910–11 season in first place with a 13–3 record. The Ottawas then played in two Cup challenges during the month of March. In a one-game challenge on March 13, Ottawa defeated the Galt Professionals of the Ontario Professional Hockey League (OPHL), 7–4, aided by three goals by future hall of fame forward Marty Walsh.\nThree days later, the Ottawas played the Port Arthur Bearcats of the New Ontario Hockey League (NOHL) in another one-game final. Walsh scored ten goals as Ottawa crushed Port Arthur, 14–4.\n1911–12.\nIn 1912, Cup trustees declared that the Cup was only to be defended at the end of the champion team's regular season. As a result, anyone who wanted to challenge for the Cup had to wait until the 1911–12 NHA season concluded. When it ended, the Ottawa HC finished in second place, with a 9–9 record, behind the Quebec Bulldogs, who posted a 10–8 record to take the league championship and take over the Cup. The Bulldogs then went on to sweep the Moncton Victorias of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL) in a best-of-three Cup challenge series, with 9–3 and 8–0 victories.\n1912–13.\nThe 1912–13 NHA season ended with Quebec Bulldogs repeating as league champions. The Bulldogs then played a two-game total goals Cup challenge series versus the Sydney Millionaires of the Maritime Professional Hockey League (MPHL), with Quebec winning 20 goals to 5. Joe Malone scored 9 goals as he led the Bulldogs to a 14–3 win in the first game. Quebec then won the second by a score of 6–2, with Joe Hall earning a hat trick.\nLater in the month, the Victoria Aristocrats of the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) challenged Quebec. However, the Bulldogs refused to put the Cup on the line, so the two teams played a best-of-three exhibition series instead. In the first series ever between the champions of the two leagues, all of the games were played in Victoria, while the differing rules of the NHA and PCHA alternated between each contest. A major rule difference was the PCHA had seven-man rules while the NHA had six. The first game was played under PCHA rules and the Aristocrats recorded a 7–5 victory. Under NHA rules in the second game, Quebec won 6–3. But in the third game, under seven-man hockey, Victoria won the exhibition series with a 6–1 victory.\n1913–14.\nAt the end of the 1913–14 NHA season, the Toronto Hockey Club and the Montreal Canadiens were tied for first place with identical 13–7 records. To determine the NHA title and the new Cup champions, both teams played a two-game total goals series. Each team recorded shutouts on its home ice: Montreal won the first game, 2–0, but Toronto came back to win the second game, 6–0. The Blue Shirts won the series, 6 goals to 2. Game two in Toronto was the first Stanley Cup playoff game ever played on artificial ice.\nLater in the month, Toronto and the PCHA's Victoria Aristocrats played a best-of-five series for the Cup. A controversy occurred when it was revealed that the Victoria club had not filed a formal challenge. A letter arrived from the Stanley Cup trustees on March 17, stating that the trustees would not let the Stanley Cup travel west, as they did not consider Victoria a proper challenger because they had not formally notified the trustees. However, on March 18, Trustee William Foran stated that it was a misunderstanding. PCHA president Lester Patrick had not filed a challenge, because he had expected Emmett Quinn of the NHA to make all of the arrangements in his role as hockey commissioner, whereas the trustees thought they were being deliberately ignored. In any case, all arrangements had been ironed out and the Victoria challenge was accepted. As it turned out, the Blue Shirts swept the series to successfully defend the Cup with scores of 5–2, 6–5 in overtime, and 2–1.\nTable of participating teams.\n\"Legend: SC = successful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (win); UC = unsuccessful Stanley Cup challenge or defense of championship (loss)\"\nThe following 16 teams unsuccessfully challenged for a Stanley Cup only once: Berlin Dutchmen, Dawson City Nuggets, Halifax Crescents, Moncton Victorias, Montreal Canadiens, New Glasgow Cubs, Ottawa Capitals, Ottawa Victorias, Port Arthur Bearcats, Smiths Falls, Sydney Millionaires, Toronto HC, Toronto Marlboros, Toronto Wellingtons, Victoria Aristocrats, Winnipeg Rowing Club."

        "text": "The 1922 Stanley Cup playoffs concluded on March 22 when the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Toronto St. Patricks defeated the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Vancouver Millionaires in the final series, three games to two. With the debut of the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) at the start of the season, these playoffs marked the first time that the NHL, the PCHA, and the WCHL all competed for the Cup.\nBackground.\nThe WCHL began play at the start of the 1921–22 season. Soon, it was agreed to alter the Stanley Cup playoffs: The champions of the two Western leagues would compete in a series, with the winner facing the NHL champion in the final round.\nAfter the 1921–22 WCHL regular season concluded, the Calgary Tigers lost to the Regina Capitals in a series to determine second place; both compiled identical 14–10 records. The Capitals then went on to beat the 15–9 first place Edmonton Eskimos in that league's first championship series.\nVancouver finished second overall in the 1921–22 PCHA regular season standings with a 12–12 record. However, they then went on to defeat the 12–11–1 first place Seattle Metropolitans in the PCHA championship series, winning both games by 1–0.\nMeanwhile, the 1921–22 NHL season was capped with the 13–10–1 second place St. Patricks defeating the 14–8–2 first place Ottawa Senators, 5 goals to 4, in the two-game total goals NHL championship series.\nSemifinal: Vancouver Millionaires defeat Regina Capitals, 5 goals to 2.\nEach contest in this Vancouver-Regina two-game total goals series was played under different rules. However, the road team prevailed in each match. Game one, played in Vancouver under the PCHA's seven-man rules, saw Dick Irvin score the game-winning goal to give the Capitals a 2–1 victory. Game two was played in Regina under the WCHL's six-man rules, but Millionaires defenceman Art Duncan recorded a hat-trick as he led Vancouver to a 4–0 shutout, and thus clinching the series on March 11 by a combined score of 5–2.\nFinal: Toronto St. Patricks defeat Vancouver Millionaires, 3 games to 2.\nAfter Vancouver won Game 1, 4–3, Babe Dye scored 4:50 into overtime of Game 2 to give Toronto a 2–1 win. In Game 3, goaltender Hugh Lehman led the Millionaires to a 3–0 shutout. However, the St. Patricks tied the series in Game 4, 6–0, as John Ross Roach became the first rookie goaltender to record a Stanley Cup shutout. Game 5 belonged to Toronto as Dye scored four goals in a 5–1 victory to win the Stanley Cup.\nDye scored 9 out of the St. Patricks' 16 goals, while Roach averaged 1.80 goals against per game.\nCup engravings.\nToronto never did engrave their names on the Cup for their 1922 championship. It was only until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1922 Toronto St. Pats.\" was put onto its then-new collar."

        "title": "ESPN Major League Baseball",
        "text": "ESPN Major League Baseball (also referred to as MLB on ESPN) is an American presentation of live Major League Baseball (MLB) games produced by ESPN. ESPN's MLB broadcasts have also aired on sister networks and platforms ESPN2, ABC and ESPN+.\nESPN's MLB coverage debuted on April 9, 1990 with three Opening Day telecasts. ESPN has held the exclusive national broadcast rights to \"Sunday Night Baseball\" since 1990. The network also airs the defending world champions game on Opening Day. In addition to regular-season games, ESPN also airs several spring training games per year, the All-Star Legends and Celebrity Softball Game (until 2021) and Home Run Derby played the week of the All-Star Game. In 2014, ESPN returned to broadcasting the Major League Baseball postseason, and has held the exclusive rights to the entire Wild Card Series since 2022.\nESPN also airs a weekly highlight show called \"Baseball Tonight\" at 6 p.m. ET on Sundays as a lead-in to \"Sunday Night Baseball\"; previously it was a daily program until 2017, when layoffs cut back the show's airing to Sundays.\nWith ESPN's most recent contract signed in 2021, \"ESPN Major League Baseball\" is guaranteed to remain on air through the 2025 season, at which point both ESPN and the MLB have opt-outs. If neither side opts out, the contract will run through the 2028 season. \nESPN Radio has also been airing Major League Baseball since 1998 (succeeding CBS Radio), broadcasting \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as select other regular-season games, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, and the entire postseason including the Wild Card Game, Division Series, League Championship Series, and World Series.\nHistory.\nSince ESPN first received MLB telecast rights, it has become traditional for the network to make an effort to cover live historic moments in the sport. For example, in 2007, ESPN and ESPN2 added several telecasts when Barry Bonds chased Hank Aaron's record for most home runs in an MLB career. ESPN had the national telecasts on August 4 when Bonds tied Aaron with number 755 and on August 7, 2007 when he hit number 756. ESPN was also the broadcaster of the final game at the original Yankee Stadium as a part of \"Sunday Night Baseball\" with Jon Miller and Hall of Famer Joe Morgan. It also showed Chris Burke's 18th-inning walk-off homer to end the 2005 NLDS series in favor of the Houston Astros against the Atlanta Braves. The St. Louis Cardinals swept the San Diego Padres in the other NLDS Series.\nAlso, the network has been given permission to interrupt regular programming, when allowed, to show attempts at new records or significant milestones live. Examples include three cut-ins from its coverage of the first X Games in 1995 until Eddie Murray recorded his 3000th hit, live coverage of Sammy Sosa's 600th home run in 2007, and a number of no-hitters, including the Buchholz feat mentioned earlier. Although it cannot show any historic attempts live during the Fox or TBS exclusive windows, it was allowed to show an in-progress highlight of Alex Rodriguez's 500th career home run in August 2007, as this was on a Saturday afternoon before Fox went on the air with its game coverage.\n1990s.\nOn January 5, 1989, Major League Baseball signed a $400 million deal with ESPN, who would show over 175 games beginning in 1990. For the next four years, ESPN would televise six games a week (\"Sunday Night Baseball\", \"Wednesday Night Baseball\" and doubleheaders on Tuesdays and Fridays), as well as multiple games on Opening Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day.\nOn April 15, 1990, ESPN's \"Sunday Night Baseball\" debuted with the experienced play-by-play announcer Jon Miller joining retired Hall of Fame player Joe Morgan in the broadcast booth. In its first year, \"Sunday Night Baseball\" averaged a 3.0 rating. That was double the number that ESPN as a whole was averaging at the time (1.5). By 1998, ESPN enjoyed its largest baseball audience ever (a 9.5 Nielsen rating) as Mark McGwire hit his 61st home run of the season. When ESPN first broadcast \"Sunday Night Baseball\", they would show at least one game from every ballpark. Also, every team was guaranteed an appearance. It was essentially, the television equivalent to a cross country stadium tour.\nIn , ESPN renewed its baseball contract for six years (through the season). The new deal was worth $42.5 million per year and $255 million overall. The deal was ultimately voided after the season and ESPN was pretty much forced to restructure their contract. In , ESPN broadcast the American League West tie-breaker game between the Seattle Mariners and California Angels with Jon Miller and Joe Morgan making the call.\nIn , ESPN began a five-year contract with Major League Baseball worth $440 million and about $80 million per year. ESPN paid for the rights to a Wednesday night doubleheader and \"Sunday Night Baseball\", as well as Opening Day and holiday telecasts and all postseason games not aired on Fox or NBC. Major League Baseball staggered the times of first-round games to provide a full-day feast for viewers: ESPN could air games at 1 p.m., 4 p.m., and 11 p.m. EDT, with the broadcast networks telecasting the prime time game.\nIn , ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. Like the American League West tie-breaker game in 1995, Jon Miller and Joe Morgan were on the call for ESPN.\nIn 1999, NBC's Bob Costas teamed with Joe Morgan to call two weekday night telecasts for ESPN. The first was on Wednesday, August 25 with Detroit Tigers playing against the Seattle Mariners. The second was on Tuesday, September 21 with the Atlanta Braves playing against the New York Mets. Later that year, ESPN broadcast the National League Wild Card tie-breaker game (this time between the New York Mets and Cincinnati Reds) with Miller and Morgan once again on the call.\n2000s.\nESPN and ESPN2 had contracts (which were signed in and ran through ) to show selected weeknight and \"Sunday Night Baseball\" games, along with Opening Day and holiday games and selected Division Series playoff games. The contracts with ESPN were worth $141.8 million per year and $851 million overall.\nIn 2002, Disney bought Fox Family, which had aired Thursday night games and some Division Series games in 2000 and 2001 as part of the Fox Sports television contract. ESPN added those games to its package, shifting the Thursday night games to weekday afternoon \"DayGame\" broadcasts. The play-by-play commentators for \"ESPN DayGame\" were Gary Thorne or Jon Sciambi along with Steve Phillips, and Steve Stone as color analysts. However, because of existing contractual obligations, the 2002 Division Series games were required to be broadcast on the renamed ABC Family. Those broadcasts used ESPN announcers, graphics, and music. The following season they aired on ESPN. \n2006.\nOn September 14, 2005, ESPN signed an eight-year contract with Major League Baseball that began with the 2006 season, renewing their rights to \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and \"Wednesday Night Baseball\", with the late (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday night game replaced by a regular weekly \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecast instead. The network also dropped special coverage of Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day games, though Memorial Day and Labor Day were still included in the Monday night coverage.\nWhile \"Sunday Night Baseball\" remained exclusive, ESPN's Monday and Wednesday telecasts were mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games were also televised by each club's local broadcasters, while ESPN's broadcasts were blacked out in the participating teams' local markets. Previously, ESPN would carry an alternate telecast (usually a simulcast of another game's local broadcast) for home-team markets which were blacked out, but those were phased out, with ESPNEWS replacing the feed.\nOn July 25, 2006, Harold Reynolds was fired from ESPN. The ESPN spokeswoman confirmed that Reynolds \"is no longer with the network\" but did not give a reason for the departure. Reynolds confirmed that an accusation of sexual harassment was the reason for his departure but called it \"a total misunderstanding\" and that \"I gave a woman a hug and I felt like it was misinterpreted.\" In February 2008, ESPN and Reynolds reached an out-of-court settlement.\nWeeks later, Peter Gammons was sidelined with a brain aneurysm. Gammons returned to ESPN in early September.\nThe weekday afternoon \"DayGame\" telecasts continued through the 2006 season as they were still covered under the separate contract inherited from Fox Family. With that contract expiring at the end of the season, the last \"DayGame\" broadcast was on September 30, 2006. The expiration of that contract also ended ESPN's involvement in broadcasting the postseason for the time being, as Fox had actually retained right-of-first-refusal of the postseason part of the contract in the sale, and chose to exercise that right to add more Division Series games. ESPN's last postseason broadcast under the contract was one of the 2006 American League Division Series.\nESPN telecasts in 2006, posted an average of 1,115,000 household impressions, up 27% when compared to 2005's 875,000. The corresponding 1.2 rating this year marks a 20% increase over the 1.0 average in 2005. ESPN2's baseball telecasts have averaged 704,000 households, an increase of 34% over 2005's 525,000. Ratings on ESPN2 went up 33% (0.8 vs. 0.6).\n2007.\nBecause of the reduction of ESPN's weekly schedule to three games, ESPN released numerous commentators from the network, including Jeff Brantley, Tino Martinez, Steve Stone and Eric Karros.\nOn April 1, for the season-opening game between the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals, ESPN changed its on-screen graphics to the version that debuted with \"Monday Night Football\" in 2006 and was later adopted by its NBA coverage at the start of the 2006-07 season. The previous graphics dated back to the advent of ESPN HD in 2004.\nDuring the week of the All-Star Game, \"Baseball Tonight\" and \"SportsCenter\" did not travel to the game site as it previously had; the 2007 site was AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco. The reason was that MLB stripped ESPN of its on-site credentials for its studio crew as punishment for leaking the rosters of the All-Star teams before TBS did. TBS' announcement, which was billed as exclusive, was scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern time but was delayed for nearly two hours, by which point ESPN, in apparent violation of its contract with MLB, went ahead and revealed the rosters anyway. ESPN later agreed to promote playoff coverage on TBS and Fox (alongside its own radio coverage) in return for \"Baseball Tonight\" going on the air shortly after each night's games concluded.\nESPN pre-empted part of the Kansas State–Auburn college football game on September 1 to show the end of the no-hitter thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz.\n2008.\nESPN2 showed the season-opening games in Tokyo between the Boston Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. Unfortunately, due to a transponder failure, viewers on DirecTV reliant on the standard-definition feed missed the first of the two games. (ESPNHD was unaffected.)\nOn March 30, ESPN showed the first-ever game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Washington Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves on a walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman.\nOn May 4, ESPN introduced enhanced updates targeting viewers who play fantasy baseball. It shows season batting statistics for the current batter on each potential count and updates batting average and other selected stats after the at-bat concludes.\n2010s.\n2010.\nStarting with the April 3 season opener between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox, ESPN began using the same graphics package which debuted with \"Monday Night Football\" in . The score banner was converted to a score box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. And instead of numbers to represent the balls, strikes and outs, dots were represented for each: three green dots for balls, two yellow dots for strikes, and two red dots for outs. The pitch count was also introduced, adopted from the New York Yankees' broadcasts on the YES Network, as well as NESN for the Boston Red Sox. College baseball and softball broadcasts, however, continued to use the previous (2007) graphics for the 2010 College World Series telecasts. ESPN's coverage of the Little League World Series also retained the 2007 graphics until midway through, and then adopted the current (2010) graphics package.\n\"Baseball Tonight\", a daily highlight show aired on ESPN during the baseball season, likewise introduced new graphics adopted from \"SportsCenter\" in June 2010.\n2011.\nThe \"ESPN Major League Baseball\" score box was slightly modified beginning with the opening day game between the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees. Numbers indicating the ball, strike and out counts replace the dots used last year; the out dots were adopted by Fox Sports Net on their local broadcasts as well as \"Major League Baseball on Fox\". The pitch speed and count are now fixed below the bases graphic. Also, the area around the bases graphic and ball, strike, and out counter is slightly translucent.\nBeginning with the \"Sunday Night Baseball\" interleague game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs on June 19, the graphics were slightly adjusted to fit in with the aspect ratio for HD broadcasts, similar to what \"Fox Saturday Baseball\", Root Sports and Fox Sports Net have done for their baseball coverage. TBS would follow suit in adjusting their graphics to the 16:9 aspect ratio.\n2012.\nThe score box and other graphics were carried over from 2011, but a new logo for all ESPN MLB presentations was unveiled at the start of the season. The ESPN logo was fixed on a CGI baseball, with the words 'Major League Baseball' (or \"Baseball Tonight\" and \"Sunday\", \"Monday\" or \"Wednesday Night Baseball\") in a stylized neon light surrounding it. A 2-D version is also used on print ads or on secondary program IDs. The graphics would stay virtually the same for the next three seasons.\nOn August 28, Major League Baseball and ESPN agreed to an eight-year, $5.6 billion contract extension, the largest broadcasting deal in Major League Baseball history. It gave ESPN up to 90 regular-season games, one of the two Wild Card games that will rotate between American League and National League teams each year, and the rights to all regular-season tiebreaker games.\n2015.\nFor the 2015 season, ESPN introduced a new on-air appearance for baseball. Among its changes were a new, persistent K-Zone Live graphic, consisting of a faded white rectangle that is overlaid live atop the strike zone on the home plate camera angle at all times. A new K-Zone 3D graphic, with ball trails and a three-dimensional box representing the strike zone, can also be used during replays. The new live K-Zone graphic was criticized by viewers and the media for being potentially distracting, drawing comparisons to baseball video games and Foxs \"glowing puck\" from its NHL coverage.\n2017.\nIn the 2017 season, ESPN introduced a new camera angle known as \"Front Row Cam\"; it is designed to provide a \"low-home\" camera angle, and utilizes a cylindrical camera pointed vertically at a mirror inside an enclosure positioned along the wall behind home plate. During the American League Wild Card Game, ESPN also introduced a new \"immersive\" K-Zone 3D component, which allows the data to be rendered into a virtual stadium environment to be viewed at different perspectives.\n2018.\nThe 2018 season saw a revamp of ESPN's lead commentary team, with Matt Vasgersian succeeding Dan Shulman, and Alex Rodriguez joining as analyst. ESPN also anticipated increased use of the Front Row Cam on \"Sunday Night Baseball\", and the immersive K-Zone 3D feature being employed on all games (a move enabled by ESPN's full adoption of on-site graphics and replay systems operated remotely from its main studios in Bristol). ESPN also unveiled a major on-air rebranding for its MLB coverage.\n2020s.\nThe 2020 regular season was delayed by four months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Matt Vasgersian and Alex Rodriguez would broadcast all of ESPN's Sunday night games from a studio at their Bristol, Connecticut headquarters. Also in July 2020, Major League Baseball announced that they would be expanding the playoffs,\nThe 2020 postseason introduced an additional \"Wild Card Series\" round, featuring eight best-of-three series preceding the Division Series. ESPN acquired the rights to seven of the series, with one replacing the Wild Card Game it already carried (the last series was allocated to TBS to replace the Wild Card Game it held the rights to). On September 28, 2020, it was announced that ABC would carry at least four Wild Card Series games, marking ABC's first national MLB broadcast since 1995.\nIn 2021, ESPN renewed its rights through the 2028 season, with opt-outs after the 2025 season. ESPN dropped most of its non-exclusive weeknight broadcasts, focusing primarily on \"Sunday Night Baseball\" instead. The network continues to hold rights to at least 30 exclusive regular season games per season, including \"Sunday Night Baseball\" and Opening Day games, along with some weeknight games in the second half of the season. ESPN also received the rights to produce alternate telecasts on its sister networks, as well as simulcasts and expanded content on ESPN+, and the ability to air selected games on ABC. The contract also gives ESPN full rights to all postseason Wild Card Series, which were made a permanent part of the postseason that year. In 2022, ESPN aired exclusive Thursday games on Opening Day and the Thursday following the all-star break, as well as two exclusive Wednesday games and one exclusive Monday game during the summer.\nFor the 2024 season, ESPN acquired the rights to air two MLB World Tour games in Seoul and one game of the MLB Mexico Series, in addition to their 30 exclusive games. New features for the season will include \"volumetric\" replays on its alternate Statcast broadcasts (which will generate replays of plays from the perspective of players), and a persistent \"win probability\" meter on the scorebug (based on input from ESPN statisticians).\nTechnology.\nThrough the years, ESPN has enhanced its Major League Baseball coverage with the introduction and implementation of innovative technology.

        "text": "Bryan Joseph Watson (November 14, 1942 – July 8, 2021) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played 16 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL). He played for the Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, Oakland Seals, Pittsburgh Penguins, St. Louis Blues, and Washington Capitals from 1963 to 1979, and briefly in the World Hockey Association with the Cincinnati Stingers. He later served as head coach of the Edmonton Oilers during the 1980–81 NHL season.\nEarly life.\nWatson was born in Bancroft, Ontario, on November 14, 1942. His father was employed by the county; his mother was a housewife. In order to expand his sporting opportunities, Watson moved to Peterborough, Ontario, when he was 13 to live with his grandparents. There, he played junior hockey with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey Association from 1960 to 1963, under the tutelege of head coach Scotty Bowman.\nPlaying career.\nMontreal Canadiens (1963–65).\nWatson signed with the Montreal Canadiens and made his NHL debut during the 1963–64 NHL season. He played in 39 games in the regular season and six games in the opening round of the Stanley Cup playoffs against the Toronto Maple Leafs. In Watson's second year, he appeared in only five games with Montreal and spent the bulk of the season with the AHL's Quebec Aces, where he played with Doug Harvey. Watson was traded to the Chicago Blackhawks for Don Johns on June 8, 1965. He was then claimed the next day by the Detroit Red Wings in the NHL Intra-League Draft.\nDetroit Red Wings (1965–67).\nDuring his first year with the Red Wings in 1965–66, Watson played all 70 games in the regular season, during which he scored his first NHL goal and led the team in penalty minutes. He also appeared in all twelve playoff games for Detroit, scoring two goals – the only playoff goals he scored in his whole career – and helping the Red Wings advance to the Stanley Cup Finals against his former team the Canadiens. In 1966–67 Watson split his time between the Red Wings and the Memphis Wings, Detroit's farm team in the CPHL.\nMontreal Canadiens (1967–68).\nWatson was left unprotected by the Red Wings in the 1967 NHL Expansion Draft. The Minnesota North Stars consequently selected him as their fifteenth pick. That same day the North Stars traded Watson to Montreal for three young prospects, Bill Plager, Leo Thiffault and Barrie Meissner. Watson appeared in only a dozen games with the Canadiens in the 1967–68 season, registering just one assist and nine penalty minutes. He played the rest of the season in the minors, first for the Cleveland Barons in the AHL (12 games) and then the majority of the season with the Houston Apollos in the CPHL.\nOakland Seals and the Pittsburgh Penguins (1968–74).\nWatson was traded to the Oakland Seals on June 28, 1968, in exchange for Tom Thurlby and a first round draft pick in 1972. After playing fifty games for the Seals in the 1968–69 season Watson was sent to the Pittsburgh Penguins in a trade involving six players. Watson spent most of the next six seasons with the Penguins. He had the best offensive season of his career in 1971–72, when he scored three goals and twenty points. He also led the Penguins in penalty minutes in three of his four full seasons with the club, and led the NHL in that statistic with 215 in 1971–72.\nDetroit Red Wings (1974–76).\nWatson started the 1973–74 season with the Penguins, before being traded to the St. Louis Blues on January 17, 1974. He played just 11 games with the team before returning to Detroit in a six-player trade less than a month later on February 14. He accumulated a career-high of 322 penalty minutes in 1975–76, second only to Steve Durbano with 370. He was also suspended for 10 games that season after fighting with Keith Magnuson of the Chicago Blackhawks on October 30, 1976.\nWashington Capitals (1976–79).\nWatson was traded to the Washington Capitals for Greg Joly several weeks into the 1976–77 regular season. In three seasons with the Capitals, he played 155 games and served 294 minutes in penalties. Watson received the Charlie Conacher Humanitarian Award in 1978 for his contributions to the Special Olympics. He sustained a serious cut to his right arm from a chainsaw in July 1978, while assisting his neighbour in chopping down a tree. However, he avoided long-term injury due to the uncommon nerve structure in his arm. During the 1978–79 regular season, he left the NHL to join the Cincinnati Stingers of the World Hockey Association, with whom he ended his playing career.\nCoaching career.\nWatson was appointed head coach of the Edmonton Oilers in 1980, at the start of the franchise's second season in the NHL, replacing Glen Sather who was promoted to President and General Manager. However, when the team posted a record of four wins, nine losses and five ties to start the season, Watson was demoted to an assistant by Sather, who resumed head coaching duties. Watson left the team after the season and never returned to coaching.\nPersonal life and death.\nWatson was married to Lindy Wilson for 53 years until his death. Together, they had two children: Stephen and Lisa. Watson and Lindy opened an Armand's pizza outlet in the Old Town section of Alexandria, Virginia, a suburb of Washington, D.C. in 1983. Fifteen years later, the business's name was changed to Bugsy's, his nickname during his playing years. Watson sold his interest in the business in 2013.\nDuring the 1980s, Watson kept on playing hockey in an over-40 league in Mount Vernon.\nWatson died on July 8, 2021, at his home in St. Michaels, Maryland. He was 78, and suffered from pneumonia prior to his death."

        "text": "Kenneth William Daniel Shields, is a former Canadian basketball coach. He is a four-time CIAU coach of the year recipient. When he retired from university coaching, he held the most wins in Canadian university men's basketball history, during which time he won a record 7-straight national championships with the University of Victoria. He is also the former head coach of the Canada men's national team.\nUniversity.\nShields began his coaching career in the 1969–1970 season with the UBC women's basketball team while completing his master's degree. This team won the Canadian Senior A women's championship that year.\nThe following season, Shields became the head coach of the Laurentian University's men's program, where he coached for the next six years. While there, Shields was awarded his first CIAU coach of the year award (1976).\nAfter his time at Laurentian, Shields became the head coach of the University of Victoria's men's program, where he coached for the next thirteen years (1978-1989). While with UVic, Shields won a record 7 consecutive CIAU national championships (1980-1986). When he retired from university coaching in 1989, he held the most wins as a coach in Canadian university men's basketball history.\nWhile coaching at UVic, Shields was named the CIAU coach of the year on three more occasions (1979, 1982, 1983), bringing his total coach of the year awards to four. During UVic's seven-run national championship run under Shields, the program produced six CIAU MVPs, eight CIAU All-Stars and nine All-Canadians. Shields and UVic reached the CIAU finals in nine of his last eleven years as head coach.\nIn his thirteen years as head coach at Victoria, Victoria won ten Canada West championships. During three of these seasons (1978–89, 1982–83, 1983–84), UVic went undefeated in regular season and playoff play. Shields was named the Canada West coach of the year on three occasions (1979, 1983, 1986).\nNational / Professional Teams.\nShields coached the junior national team through the 1980s during major events, including two world championships.

Shields served as an assistant coach for the Australian senior men's team during the 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2006, Shields was a consultant to the Milwaukee Bucks.\nIn 2007, Shields was the head coach of the Georgian men's national team. In 2010, he was an assistant coach with the Great Britain women's national team.\nPost-career.\nShields was appointed to the Order of Canada (invested in 1999). He was inducted into the Canada Sports Hall of Fame (2009), the Canada Basketball Hall of Fame (1999), the Canada West Hall of Fame (2019-2020 induction class), the BC Sports Hall of Fame (2013), the University of Victoria Sports Hall of Fame (2002) and the Greater Victoria Sports Hall of Fame (2003). In 2007, he was awarded the James Naismith Award by Canada Basketball for significant lifelong contribution to basketball in Canada.\nAdditionally, the 1979-86 UVic men's teams were inducted into the Canada West Hall of Fame (2019-2020 induction class); the 1979-80 UVic team was inducted into the BC Sports Hall of Fame (2020); the 1982-83 UVic team was inducted into the UVic Sports Hall of Fame (2023); and the 1969-70 UBC women's team was inducted into the UBC Sports Hall of Fame (1993), with Shields being recognized as coach in all of these team inductions.\nFurther, being disillusioned as a student that there was not a university program to study coaching, Shields was instrumental in establishing the University of Victoria's National Coaching Institute. He was also the founding president of the Commonwealth Centre for Sport Development.\nIn 1993, the first \"Ken Shields basketball, academics &amp; community service award\" was presented to a Canadian male university basketball athlete.\nShields also developed the High Performance Training Centres for rowing, soccer and middle-distance running at the University of Victoria. He also served as a committee member for hosting the Commonwealth Games in Victoria.\nStudent Athlete.\nShields' family moved to Prince Rupert, British Columbia for his grade 11 year. He tried out for the high school basketball team, only to become the manager of the B team. This year, he played in the community league and improved so much as to make the A team the following year. His high school team won the provincial high school championship that year.\nShields played at Mount Royal College, two seasons at the University of Calgary (1965-1967) and then two seasons at the University of British Columbia (1967-1969). He was named a WCIAA All-Star in 1967 while playing for Calgary. It is reported that Shields \"later was on the radar of Jack Donohue's national team.\"\nPersonal life.\nShields was born on December 7, 1945, in Beaverlodge, Alberta and is described as a \"Prince Rupert, B.C. native\". He is married to Kathy Shields, the legendary coach of the women's UVic basketball program. Together, Ken and Kathy Shields have won a combined 15 national championships with their respective UVic teams. They met while Ken was coaching the women's team at UBC in 1969–70.\nIn university, Shields realized he wanted to coach; however, given the lack of a coaching program, he studied Physical Education and used that training in his coaching career."

        "text": "Blessings Golf Club is a private, 18-hole golf course located along Clear Creek in Johnson, Arkansas, near Fayetteville. Its creation was funded by Tyson Foods Chairman John H. Tyson. Blessings was designed by Robert Trent Jones, Jr. and opened in June 2004. From the back tees, its rating is 79.1 and its slope is 153, making it one of the toughest golf courses in the U.S. Its routing is a true \"out-in\" design, in that the 9th hole does not end at the clubhouse. Blessings features three par-5 holes on the \"out\" nine and three par-3 holes on the \"in\" nine, for a par of 37-35=72. Its topography is characterized by hilly terrain creating numerous sidehill lies, dramatic elevation changes, forced carries over ravines and valleys, and large, undulating greens, with Clear Creek in play on several holes.\nBlessings' clubhouse was designed in a modern style by architect Marlon Blackwell. The clubhouse is outfitted with natural, organic design features including local stone and imported, exotic woods used throughout the interior. It features a pro shop, restaurant, lounge, men's and women's locker rooms, a large indoor practice facility, and a swimming pool.\nBlessings is also home to the University of Arkansas golf teams. The membership and the Razorbacks enjoy the Fred and Mary Smith practice facility, located on the grounds. It features six indoor/outdoor practice bays, an indoor video swing analysis station, office space and fully furnished men and women’s locker room facilities for the Razorbacks. As well as a 40 yard indoor chipping/pitching area.\nThe 2019 NCAA Division I Women's and Men's Golf Championships were held at Blessings, with the Duke women and Stanford men winning the team titles. Maria Fassi of Arkansas was the women's individual champion and Matthew Wolff of Oklahoma State won the men's individual title."

        "title": "St Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground",
        "text": "St Helen's Rugby and Cricket Ground, commonly known simply as St Helens Ground, is a sports venue in Swansea, Wales, owned and operated by the City and County of Swansea Council. Used mainly for rugby union and cricket, it has been the home ground of Swansea RFC and Swansea Cricket Club since it opened in 1873.\nIn rugby union, St Helen's was the venue for the first ever home match of the Wales national team in 1882. It continued to be used regularly by Wales, often for the Five Nations Championship, until 1954, but has staged only one full international since, in 1997. More recently, the ground has been used by the Wales women's team.\nGlamorgan County Cricket Club have regularly used St Helen's as an outground since 1921. The ground has staged two One Day Internationals: England against New Zealand in 1973, and a 1983 World Cup match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. St. Helen's was the location of Sir Garfield Sobers's six sixes in a single over in first-class cricket, the maximum possible runs in a single over, and the first time it had been done.\nSt Helen's has also staged international matches in two other sports. In rugby league, Wales played thirteen matches at the ground between 1945 and 1978, two of which were part of the 1975 World Cup tournament. A football international between Wales and Ireland took place at St Helen's in 1894.\nHistory.\nSince the ground opened in 1873 it has been the home of the Swansea Rugby Football Club, and the Swansea Cricket Club.\nOn 19 June 1928 the ground was the venue of a mile race, for Swansea Grammar School's Sports Day, won by a teenage Dylan Thomas; he carried a newspaper photograph of his victory with him until his death.\nIn 2005, the venue could hold an audience of 10,500 seated before it was re-developed. The famous east stand, which had provided cloisters over part of Oystermouth Road, has since been demolished and replaced with a metallic stand unloved by locals. In late November 2007, the ground's perimeter wall in the South East corner, next to Mumbles Road and Gorse Lane, was knocked down and a new wall built further inside the ground, in similar style to the old wall. This was to accommodate a new car park with 39 spaces for the Patti Pavilion.\nSt. Helen's Ground is claimed to be home to the tallest freestanding flood light in Europe, with the light in the north-eastern corner of the ground standing at 150ft (40m).\nRugby.\nThe first home international in the history of Welsh rugby was played at St Helen's on 16 December 1882, against England. The ground was the scene of New Zealand's first victory over Wales in 1924. On 10 April 1954, St. Helen's staged its last international until a Test match between Wales and Tonga was also played at the ground in 1997. The decision to abandon Swansea as an international rugby union venue in the 1950s was prompted by overstretch of what was then a 50,000-capacity ground; delays for players and spectators travelling west along the A48, especially at Port Talbot; and higher revenues from games at Cardiff Arms Park. Swansea Corporation discussed raising the capacity to 70,000 or even 82,000, but wartime bomb damage inflicted on the city forced a revision of building priorities. However, the ground has been used to host three Welsh women's internationals. The first women's international at Swansea was in April 1999 against England, and the most recent was in November 2009 when Wales defeated Sweden 56–7.\nSwansea RFC defeated New Zealand 11–3 at St Helen's on 28 September 1935, becoming the first club side to beat the All Blacks. Swansea also defeated world champions Australia 21–6 in November 1992, when Australia played their first match of their Welsh Tour.\nBetween 1919 and 1952, St Helen's was also the home of Swansea Uplands RFC until the club sought its new home in Upper Killay.\nDuring the 1975 Rugby League World Cup, Australia defeated Wales 18–6 in front of 11,112 fans (this match was broadcast throughout the United Kingdom by the BBC). The two sides again played at Swansea as part of the 1978 Kangaroo tour with the Kangaroos winning 8-3 before a crowd of 4,250.\nRugby league internationals.\nList of international rugby league matches played at St Helen's.\nFootball.\nList of Wales International football matches played at St Helen's.\nCricket.\nIt was in this ground in 1968 that Garfield Sobers hit the first six sixes in one over in first-class cricket. Sobers was playing as captain of Nottinghamshire against Glamorgan.\nAs part of their commitment to the entire country of Wales, Glamorgan County Cricket Club play some of their home matches at St Helen's, as well as their regular home ground, SWALEC Stadium in Cardiff, and Penrhyn Avenue in Rhos-on-Sea.\nWales Minor Counties Cricket Club, who have played minor counties cricket since 1988, use the ground as a home base. They are currently the only non-English team in the Minor Counties Championship.\nInternational centuries.\nA single ODI century has been scored at the venue."

        "title": "List of 2006 FIFA World Cup controversies",
        "text": "The 2006 FIFA World Cup generated various controversies, including onfield disputes, critiques of official decisions, and team salary issues. Most centered on specific refereeing decisions, which led many of the world's media to claim that the referees were spoiling the World Cup. Numerous World Cup records were also set by controversial calls, including Graham Poll's three-card error and Valentin Ivanov's record number of cards in a single match.\nRefereeing.\nCroatia vs. Australia (group stage).\nThe deciding game for the Group F runners-up place, Croatia vs. Australia, saw a number of refereeing errors and controversies occur. Early in the first half, Australian striker Mark Viduka was wrestled to the ground within the penalty box by Croatian defender Josip Šimunić, but appeals for a foul or penalty kick were dismissed by English referee Graham Poll. Later in the first half, Croatian defender Stjepan Tomas handballed in the penalty box and a penalty kick was awarded to Australia, however Graham Poll failed to penalize Tomas for exactly the same deed in the middle of the second half when Australia was trying to equalize again. When Australia striker Harry Kewell equalized for Australia in the second half, he appeared to be offside for the goal, but the goal was still allowed to stand. Deep into stoppage time in the second half, there were two balls on the pitch, and Graham Poll then blew full-time at the instant Australia scored what would've been a winning goal.\nThree yellow cards.\nThe English referee Graham Poll mistakenly issue three yellow cards to Croatian Josip Šimunić before sending him off. Šimunić was shown a yellow card by Poll in the 61st minute for a foul on Harry Kewell. In the 90th minute, Poll again showed Šimunić a yellow card for a foul, but did not follow it with a mandatory red card. In the 93rd minute, after Poll had blown the final whistle, Šimunić approached Poll angrily and gave him a push. Poll thus issued Šimunić with a third yellow card and also showed him the red card.\nQuestions were raised as to why Poll's assistants Phil Sharp and Glenn Turner, and the fourth official Kevin Stott, had also failed to realise the error. Poll later denied any blame should be placed upon the other officials saying, \"I was the referee, it was my error and the buck stops with me\". Poll reported that the officials had felt \"disbelief\" upon hearing of the error in the dressing room after the game. He and the other officials consequently reviewed the DVD of the game, and Poll realised that his \"dream was over\".\nThe Football Federation Australia chief executive John O'Neill later said that \"Australia could have had grounds for a very strong appeal should Croatia have won the match\". Poll also explained the reason for his mistake by saying that he \"incorrectly noted down the name of the Australia number three Craig Moore when booking Šimunić for the second time and failed to realise his error\" Šimunić is Australian-born, and hence speaks English with an Australian accent, probably causing the mistake.\nThe FIFA Referees Committee President Ángel María Villar defended Poll but had to concede that an error had occurred. In a statement he remarked, \"Thursday evening's 2–2 draw between Croatia and Australia in Stuttgart saw referee Graham Poll make an error\". As a result of his error, Poll and his assistants did not progress to the second stage of the tournament. Despite encouragement from the FIFA president Sepp Blatter and chief executives of the Football Association and Premier League, Poll retired from international tournaments. He explained his decision to retire was a result of the \"pain and agony\" and \"sleepless nights\" that resulted from his mistake and the fear of it happening again.\nAustralia vs. Japan (group stage).\nIn the first-round game of Australia versus Japan, the Egyptian referee Essam Abd El Fatah awarded a 26th-minute goal by Shunsuke Nakamura to the Japanese despite a protest from Australian goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer. Schwarzer appeared to have been impeded by the Japanese forward Atsushi Yanagisawa as he came forward to punch the ball clear. The Japanese striker Naohiro Takahara then collided with Schwarzer, leaving him unable to prevent the ball rolling into the goal.\nSchwarzer told reporters later that El Fatah had apologised to him for his mistake and had told Australia's captain Mark Viduka that he was grateful \"that God was on his side because the result went Australia's way in the end.\" Viduka told reporters \"it was obvious that he made a mistake but everybody makes a mistake.\" Abdul-Fatah denied issuing an apology however, and said that \"FIFA's refereeing committee... agreed unanimously that Japan's goal against Australia was correct\", and would have awarded a penalty against Australia had the ball not gone in, as Takahara was pushed into Schwarzer by Craig Moore.\nAustralia's coach Guus Hiddink chose to \"slightly, but not totally, apologise\" for an off-field incident in which he pushed an official in a scramble to see a television replay of the goal. Hiddink said he believed it was an obvious foul, but also that Schwarzer \"can defend himself even more\" against such incidents.\nThe FIFA communications director Markus Siegler told the press later that a penalty should have been awarded to Japan for a foul on the Japanese midfielder Yūichi Komano by Tim Cahill. Siegler said \"it was a clear mistake of the referee.\" Had a yellow card been shown to Cahill, who scored the deciding goal for Australia minutes later, he would have been sent off, with the score at 1–1. The Japanese coach Zico expressed frustration at FIFA's comments, saying that El Fatah had apologised for the mistake to the Australians but had not apologised for the error that FIFA admitted to. The Japan Football Association filed an official complaint against the Egyptian referee, who was sent home along with the English referee Graham Poll.\nFrance vs. South Korea (group stage).\nIn the 31st minute of the game between France and South Korea, the French midfielder Patrick Vieira had a header at goal which appeared to be saved by Korean goalkeeper Lee Woon-Jae from behind the goal line. Mexican referee Benito Archundia and his linesmen did not believe the ball had passed the line, and no goal was awarded. The game resulted in a last minute 1–1 draw, shocking the French. French coach Raymond Domenech believed that France \"scored a second time, but the referee did not recognize that.\" Television replays showed that the goal should have been awarded. French player Thierry Henry claimed the team was \"really upset\" when they saw the ball had passed the goal-line as \"if he (the referee) had given us the valid goal, that would not have offered the Koreans the opportunity to come back into the match.\" However, it should also be noted that the corner kick leading to the header should have been a goal kick, as the ball had gone out of bounds off a French player. In addition, there appeared to be a whistle on the play for a foul on France, which would have negated the goal anyway.\nThe controversy revived questions over the possibility of goal-line technology use at the World Cup. A FIFA spokesperson, Markus Siegler, ruled out the short term likelihood saying that \"its introduction depends on a system being developed that is 100 percent reliable\". French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez voiced opposition to video replays during a game as \"it's a shame to stop the play.\" Barthez said that he'd like to see more referees with \"one in each half, and one behind each goal.\"\nPortugal vs. Netherlands (round of 16).\nReferee Valentin Ivanov set a new record for the number of red cards issued in a World Cup match with four, and tied the record for yellow cards with 16. FIFA president Sepp Blatter said of Ivanov, \"I consider that today the referee was not at the same level as the participants, the players. There could have been a yellow card for the referee,\" although he later recanted, saying, \"I regret what I said about his actions in the match between Portugal and the Netherlands.\" The managers also blamed each other for not playing fairly; Portugal's Luiz Felipe Scolari said, \"FIFA talks about fair play. There was no fair play,\" while the Netherlands' Marco van Basten responded, \"If you talk about fair play, you should watch yourself first... [Portugal was] a bit more experienced with all these tricks and all this time wasting.\"\nIvanov criticized both teams, reportedly saying, \"They are known for time wasting and hitting from behind. I was unpleasantly surprised by seeing such things from the Dutch. More so, they were the instigators.\"\nIn the 7th minute, Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo left the match with an injury after being tackled in the thigh by Khalid Boulahrouz. \"International Herald Tribune\" writer Rob Hughes wrote that he had not seen \"a more cynical and brutal attempt to kick a player out of a match than what [Boulahrouz] did to [Ronaldo],\" and that he should have been red carded on two occasions, but only received a yellow card. Boulahrouz was sent off in the 63rd minute after receiving his second yellow card for an elbow to Luís Figo's face.\nIn the 60th minute, Figo received a yellow card despite head-butting Dutchman Mark van Bommel, usually a red card offence, as stated by Law 12 of \"The Laws of Football\" – \"A player shall be sent off if he/she is guilty of violent conduct.\" Figo did not receive further sanctions and was cleared to play in the subsequent quarter-final match against England as he had been shown the yellow card during the match. Van Bommel said of the decision, \"Figo head butted me and that is not a yellow card. I blame the referee, it was a clear red card.\"\nItaly vs. France (final).\nZinedine Zidane opened the scoring in the 7th minute by converting a controversial penalty spot kick, which glanced off the underside of the crossbar and into the goal. The penalty was awarded after Florent Malouda went down inside the Italian penalty area under a challenge from Italian defender Marco Materazzi. The call was somewhat controversial—as it was put by an Associated Press report posted in the ESPN website \"Malouda stumbled – many might say dived – in the penalty area and Elizondo immediately signaled a penalty kick\".\nItaly then equalized at the 19th minute with a header by Materazzi himself and went on to win the title on penalty shoot out. The controversy surrounding the penalty was however overshadowed by the discussion surrounding Zinedine Zidane's sending off by the end of extra-time for headbutting the Italian player in the chest.\nGeneral concerns with officiating less-prominent teams.\nMatch referees have faced accusations of bias from the media and team representatives for allegedly favouring larger and better-established teams at the finals, at the expense of less established football nations.\nAfter the Australian team was knocked out of the tournament as a result of a controversial penalty given against defender Lucas Neill in their second-round match against Italy, Australian assistant coach Graham Arnold was quoted as saying, \"We are a small footballing nation that gets no favours. All we ask for is a fair go, and I don't think we received it over the four games.\" Likewise, after going down to Brazil in their second-round match, Ghana's head coach Ratomir Dujković stated that \"the referee might as well have been wearing a yellow shirt under his own\".\nOne basis for these claims has been the irregular balance of fouls sanctioned by referees between traditional powers and emerging teams. As of 27 June, the top eight seeded teams have a combined net surplus of 93 more fouls sustained than committed with an average of 3.1 per match, according to statistics published on FIFA's website.\nOn average, as of 27 June, the team with the highest fouls count of the finals have been debutants; Ghana, with a 1.95 ratio between fouls committed and fouls sustained, Tunisia with a ratio of 1.76 fouls committed/sustained, and Australia with a 1.75 ratio.\nBy contrast, the teams with fewer fouls committed have been traditional powerhouses Italy, Brazil and Spain – with respective averages of 0.66, 0.67 and 0.75 in fouls committed/sustained ratios.\nOn the other hand, the teams that committed the least fouls (less than 50 in three games) were Trinidad and Tobago, Costa Rica, Côte d'Ivoire, South Korea, Paraguay, Poland and Japan (the latter with just 38 fouls). Also, of the 5 teams most judged wrongly offside, four were in \"Pot A\", which therefore seeds them in the top 8 (Italy, Argentina, France and Brazil) and the other emerging European side Ukraine. Of the teams that were judged to be in an offside position incorrectly on no occasion in the first three games, only one (Mexico) was seeded into \"Pot A\".\nWhile these statistics could be used to support claims of bias, they could also indicate that some teams are rougher and that the stronger teams are more disciplined, and their success is due to their not committing excessive fouls. Additionally it should be considered that a team in possession is more likely to sustain a foul than a defending team, and therefore the successful teams are likely to sustain more fouls.\nFIFA president Sepp Blatter told before the tournament that referees should protect big star players: \"What has been clearly said to referees is 'please protect the physical integrity of the players', and that means protecting the big stars\".\nDefence of referees.\nOn summing up the progress of the tournament at the conclusion of the group stage, Sepp Blatter spoke in defence of FIFA's officiating in the tournament, stating \"... referees are only human, and they make mistakes. We have to reduce the number of mistakes, but we're all still searching in vain for perfection.\" Despite Blatter's statement, both Ivanov and Poll, referees at the center of the two largest controversies, were not included on the twelve-team list of officials selected by FIFA to referee the final eight matches of the competition.\nPlayer disputes.\nTogo.\nFollowing months of confusion over who would be managing the African debutants Togo, Otto Pfister was only confirmed in the job the day before their opening match against South Korea. Pfister had previously resigned as coach of the team. The players threatened to boycott the final group match against France due to pay disputes.\nDiscipline.\nCertain matches attracted attention due to the high number of cards.\nThe Italy – USA match had three red cards with De Rossi of Italy in particular given marching orders for elbowing an opponent. This match was second only to the encounter between the Netherlands and Portugal (which had four, as well as 16 yellows). A Croatian player was also sent off after having (mistakenly) been given three yellow cards by referee Graham Poll.\nFan issues.\nSome Dutch fans were forced to take off their trousers branded with the logo of Bavaria beer, as Budweiser was the official beer of the tournament. Rather than leave the stadium, they proceeded to watch the match in their underclothes.\nCrime.\nHooliganism.\nWhile the German Police expressed satisfaction in their ability to contain and deal with hooliganism, speculation was rife that a number of potential flashpoints existed which could cause widespread public disorder. With a number of routes into the country, amongst them the open land borders which are a consequence of the Schengen agreement, apprehension of known troublemakers and organisers of disturbances looked to be a very real problem. However, during the World Cup, Germany suspended its rules granting passport-free travel to EU citizens. As an illustration of this, on 8 June, German police apprehended 9 English hooligans attempting to enter the country via the Czech border. Britain has a particularly stringent policy of restricting foreign travel of known football hooligans during periods where the England team are involved. 3,500 banning orders were served, and by 8 June all but 150 had surrendered their passports. On 9 June Channel 4 News in the UK reported that although there had been no violence, England fans in Frankfurt had been kicking footballs at the windows of the city's 600-year-old Römer city hall building, although local police decided not to take action over this minor incident and the staff at the Mayor's office apparently took the attempted vandalism in good humour. On the day of England's first match against Paraguay two England fans were arrested for having swastikas and SS insignia painted on their bodies. The two were flown back to England to appear in court; one was found guilty and banned from attending football matches until 2008, while the other was not banned as the symbol (the double-sig rune of the SS) was painted on his back, and he may not have been able to see it or known what it was. The court heard that the fan found guilty also had a letter J on his arm, believed to be a slight to Jews, but claimed not to know its meaning. There was also concern over hooligans among the 300,000 Polish fans who travelled to Germany for the tournament. This supposition was borne out as clashes between rival groups of supporters culminated in the arrest of 429 prior to and in the wake of the game between Germany and Poland in Dortmund.\nOn 14 June, ITV news in the UK reported that up to that date 7 England fans had been arrested, one for a \"serious offence\".\nRacism.\nIt was claimed that \"foreign-looking\" people should not visit some areas in the former East Germany, after one newspaper reported that neo-Nazi skinheads were planning violence against foreigners. Germany contains a small but vocal neo-Nazi minority who have engaged in violent attacks against the country's immigrants, as well as foreign visitors, since the fall of the Berlin Wall and subsequent German reunification. According to German police, neo-Nazi hate crime was on the rise and had increased significantly over the preceding few months.\nTwo human rights organizations, the Africa Council, based in Berlin, and the International League of Human Rights advised black and Asian fans to avoid certain areas of eastern Germany during the World Cup.\nThe far-right NPD, an organisation which the German government unsuccessfully tried to ban in 2001, had planned to march through Gelsenkirchen on 10 June, a day after Ecuador met Poland in the city's new purpose-built stadium. This march had first been banned by the German police, but later permitted by the Gelsenkirchen Administrative Court. Other far-right marches were planned for Frankfurt and Herne during the competition, although these were subsequently banned.\nFIFA announced that at the World Cup, teams could have points deducted for racist remarks by players and officials. A \"Football Against Racism\" logo covered each field's center circle until kickoff at all World Cup matches. Prior to every quarter-final match, the captains read a \"declaration against racism\" over the PA system.\nThe European Union launched a campaign against racism before the World Cup. Friso Roscam Abbing, spokesman for the EU Justice and Home Affairs Commissioner indicated that the campaign also targeted prostitution rings and human trafficking.\nTrafficking of women.\nSome international human rights groups (like the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), the Nordic Council and Amnesty International) expressed concern that there would be an increase in the trafficking of women up to and during the World Cup. PACE and Amnesty claimed that 30,000 women and girls might become the subject of slavery for the purposes of forced prostitution during the World Cup. They called upon the German authorities to monitor sex venues during the World Cup and provide support for the victims of trafficking.\nAccording to German police, there was no noticeable increase in forced prostitution during the World Cup. While there was a significant influx of (legal and illegal) prostitutes to Germany before the World Cup, most of those were reported to have left within the first two weeks. Police officials from several cities quoted prostitutes saying that business actually decreased.\nComputer cracking.\nFIFA's IT provider Avaya indicated that it expected, and was prepared for, the denial-of-service attacks which were unsuccessfully launched at the IT network for the 2002 World Cup. No successful attacks were launched on the German World Cup system."

        "text": "1902 was the 13th season of County Championship cricket in England. Australia had won a classic Test series against England 2–1. The first two Tests were rained off but the final three were full of drama. Victor Trumper scored a century before lunch in the third Test, Australia won the fourth by just 3 runs and England won the fifth by one wicket following a century in 75 minutes by Gilbert Jessop. It was the 21st series between the two teams. Yorkshire won their third consecutive County Championship title and, as in 1901, went through the season with only one defeat.\nCounty Championship.\nFinal table.\nThe final County Championship table is shown below. One point was awarded for a win, none for a draw, and minus one for a loss. Positions were decided on percentage of points over completed games.\nPoints system:\nAshes tour.\nIn the 1967 Wisden Cricketer's Almanack, A. A. Thomson described this series as \"a rubber more exciting than any in history except the Australia v West Indies series in 1960–61\". This description came despite the fact that Australia had secured the series after four of five matches, leading 2–0 before the final Test; the first two matches had been drawn due to rain, with the second match at Lord's yielding only 38 overs in three days.\nThe third Test, the only one ever to be played at Bramall Lane, saw Australia win by 143 runs, following a brilliant century by Victor Trumper before lunch on the first day. In the fourth Test Australia won by three runs, despite 11 wickets from recalled bowler Bill Lockwood. It came down to Fred Tate and Wilfred Rhodes needing to hit eight runs. Tate hit a four, but was bowled by Jack Saunders with the fourth ball of his over. England came back to win the final Test, conceding a first-innings deficit of 141, then going to 48 for five needing 263 to win, before Gilbert Jessop hit a hundred in 75 minutes and England won by one wicket.\nTrumper made a great impression on those who saw him bat. Harry Altham wrote: \"From start to finish of the season, on every sort of wicket, against every sort of bowling, Trumper entranced the eye, inspired his side, demoralized his enemies, and made run-getting appear the easiest thing in the world.\""

        "title": "1961 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 1961 Tour de France was the 48th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's Grand Tours. It took place between 25 June and 16 July, with 21 stages covering a distance of . Out of the 132 riders who started the tour, 72 managed to complete the tour's tough course. Throughout the 1961 Tour de France, two of the French national team's riders, André Darrigade and Jacques Anquetil held the yellow jersey for the entirety 21 stages. There was a great deal of excitement between the second and third places, concluding with Guido Carlesi stealing Charly Gaul's second-place position on the last day by two seconds.\nTeams.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nSince Jacques Anquetil had won the 1957 Tour de France, he was unable to repeat it, due to illness, tiredness and struggle within the French team. For 1961, he asked the team captain Marcel Bidot to make a team that would only ride for him, and Bidot agreed. Anquetil announced before the race that he would take the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification on the first day, and wear it until the end of the race in Paris.\nGastone Nencini, who won the previous edition, did not enter in 1961, but Graziano Battistini, his teammate and runner-up of 1960, started the race as leader of the Italian team. If the French team would again have internal struggles, the Italian team could emerge as the winner.\nThe Spanish team had two outsiders, José Pérez Francés and Fernando Manzaneque. The last outsider was Charly Gaul, winner of the 1958 Tour de France, who rode in the mixed Luxembourg/Swiss team. He considered his teammates so weak that he did not seek their help, and rode the race on his own. Raymond Poulidor was convinced by his team manager Antonin Magne that it would be better to skip the Tour, because the national team format would undermine his commercial value.\nRoute and stages.\nThe 1961 Tour de France started on 25 June in Rouen, and had one rest day, in Montpellier. For the first time the finish on top of the Superbagnères was included to the race. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet mountain pass on stage 17.\nRace overview.\nAndré Darrigade won the opening stage, and it became the fifth time that he won the opening stage. Darrigade had been in a small group that broke away, which included Anquetil. Other competitors, such as Gaul and Battistini, already lost more than 5 minutes. After that, there was a time trial, won by Jacques Anquetil. Anquetil became the leader of the race, with his teammate Joseph Groussard in second place, almost five minutes behind him.\nThe second stage, run in bad weather, featured small roads in Northern France. Several cyclists got into problems, and seven cyclists already had to leave the race; the favourites were not harmed. In the sixth stage, West German Horst Oldenburg fell down on the descent of the Col de la Schlucht, and the Dutch team captain Ab Geldermans ran into him. Geldermans was taken to the Belfort hospital by helicopter, and the Dutch team had lost its captain.\nUnlike previous years, the French team continued without fights, and won five of the first eight stages. The ninth stage included four major climbs. On the second climb, Gaul escaped. He crashed on the descent of the third mountain, but managed to stay away and win the stage; Anquetil was not far behind and kept the lead. Anquetil had a five-minutes margin on the second-placed rider, which was Manzaneque. In the eleventh stage, Graziano Battistini was hit by a car, and had to leave the race.\nThis situation had not changed when the sixteenth stage started. It was expected that Gaul, in third place more than six minutes behind, would attack, but this did not happen, because Gaul had been injured in his crash in the previous stage.\nThe last chance for the opposition to win back time on Anquetil was in the seventeenth stage, but Anquetil stayed close to his direct competitors, and only allowed lower classified riders to escape. The press criticized Anquetil's tactics, saying he was riding passively. In the nineteenth stage, an individual time trial, Gaul was on his way to win back a little time on Anquetil, when he crashed heavily, and could not find his pace again. Anquetil won almost three minutes on Gaul and extended his lead to more than ten minutes.\nIn the final two stages, Anquetil did not get into problems. His main rival Gaul even lost time in the last stage, and conceded his second place to Guido Carlesi.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were several classifications in the 1961 Tour de France, two of them awarding jerseys to their leaders. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as third-, second- or first-category, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The cyclist with the most points lead the classification, but was not identified with a jersey.\nFor the team classification The calculation was different from previous years. Before 1961, the classification was based on time, but in 1961, it was based on points; times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the team with the lowest time on a stage won the team prize for that stage. The overall team classification was calculated by counting the number of team prizes.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award, in which a jury composed of journalists gave points after each stage to the cyclist they considered most combative. The split stages each had a combined winner. At the conclusion of the Tour, the entire West/South-West team won the overall super-combativity award, also decided by journalists. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Ballon d'Alsace on stage 6. This prize was won by Jef Planckaert.\nAftermath.\nAs Anquetil had led the race after every stage, there was not much competitiveness, which organiser Jacques Goddet termed a \"fiasco\". After the race, the system with national teams was abandoned, and it was announced that the 1962 Tour de France would be run with sponsored teams."

        "text": "Brian G. McDermott (born 16 March 1970) is an English professional rugby league coach who was the head coach of Featherstone Rovers in the RFL Championship, resigning on 26 Sep 2022, after the loss to Batley Bulldogs. He is a former professional rugby league player.\nHe was previously the head coach of Leeds in the Super League and of the USA national team. Nicknamed 'Big Mac', McDermott was a Great Britain international forward who played his entire career at club level for Bradford, winning Super League Grand Finals and Challenge Cups with them.\nHe began his coaching career in 2003 as an assistant at Huddersfield, taking his first senior coaching role with in 2006, before joining Leeds as head coach in 2010. McDermott coached Leeds to several major trophies including the 2011, 2012, 2015 and 2017 Super League titles, the 2012 World Club Challenge, and the 2014 and 2015 Challenge Cups.\nBackground.\nMcDermott was born in Wakefield, West Riding of Yorkshire, England. He played amateur rugby league as a junior for Eastmoor RLFC and was a Royal Marine for five years before becoming a professional player.\nPlaying career.\n1990s.\nMcDermott joined Bradford Northern (later Bradford Bulls) in 1994, where he stayed for 10 years. He played for Bradford at prop forward in their 1996 Challenge Cup final loss to St. Helens. He played for Bradford Bulls from the interchange bench in the 1999 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St Helens.\nMcDermott won a cap for England in 2001 against Wales, and won caps for Great Britain in 1996 against Fiji, and 3 in 1997 against Australia (Super League).\n2000s.\nMcDermott played for the Bradford Bulls at in their 2001 Super League Grand Final victory against the Wigan Warriors. As Super League VI champions, the Bradford Bulls played against 2001 NRL Premiers, the Newcastle Knights in the 2002 World Club Challenge. McDermott played as a prop forward in Bradford's victory. He also played for Bradford from the interchange bench in their 2002 Super League Grand Final loss against St Helens. After ending his playing career in 2003, McDermott moved into coaching.\nCoaching career.\nHarlequins RL.\nMcDermott had spells on the coaching staff at Super League clubs Huddersfield and Leeds before accepting his first top-flight head coaching role at Harlequins in July 2006, replacing Tony Rea. McDermott won his first match as a head coach against Castleford. He went on to claim five wins and four losses in the remainder of 2006.\nMcDermott remained at Harlequins for a further four seasons but the team decreased in performance. The team which had been in the top 5 in the year before McDermott's arrival finished 7th, then 9th then 9th again. Harlequins RL went on three long streaks of very poor form in the last season and a half of McDermott's tenure.\nThe 2009 saw a second half of the season collapse with the team winning only 1 of its last 12 games and finishing 11th.\nThe 2010 season saw an early win against Catalans Dragons, but again only one win in the first 11 games. \nThere were quite a few big losses by scores such as 62–4, 58-0 and 52–12. After a midseason streak of four wins in five games, the team again returned to losing form, losing 7 out of the last 9. McDermott had not secured the team's better players to new contracts, such as Louie McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Will Sharp, Danny Orr, Oliver Wilkes and Luke Williamson and the team had finished 11th and 13th in successive seasons.\nLeeds Rhinos.\nMcDermott left Harlequins and returned to Leeds as Assistant Manager at the end of the 2010 season. On 25 October 2010, following the resignation of incumbent coach Brian McClennan, it was announced that McDermott would take over as head coach at Headingley on a three-year contract.\nMcDermott coached Leeds to the 2011 Challenge Cup Final defeat by Wigan at Wembley Stadium.\nHowever, McDermott guided Leeds to 2011 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford, after finishing in 5th place in the league. McDermott replicated the same feat in 2012, where Leeds won the World Club Challenge against Manly.\nHe coached Leeds to their 2012 Challenge Cup Final defeat by Warrington at Wembley Stadium.\nTwo months later, the two sides met again in the 2012 Super League Grand Final which Leeds won for the sixth time in nine years with the victory over Warrington at Old Trafford and making it two out of two for McDermott in his first two years as head coach.\nBy coincidence, on 12 April 2013 Leeds United announced their new manager as Brian McDermott, meaning that both the rugby league and football teams in the city of Leeds had managers with the same name. Both sides also had players by the name of Ryan Hall at the same time, one a 25-year-old winger for the rugby league side, the other a 25-year-old winger for Leeds United.\nIn 2014 McDermott coached Leeds in the 2014 Challenge Cup Final victory over Castleford at Wembley Stadium, their first Challenge Cup win since 1999. They were knocked out of the playoffs against Catalans Dragons after finishing 6th in the league, their worst position since 1996.\nIn 2015 McDermott coached Leeds to a historic treble, winning the Challenge Cup 50–0, scoring a last second try against Huddersfield to win the League Leaders' Shield, and beating Wigan in a major final for the first time by 22–20 in the 2015 Super League Grand Final victory at Old Trafford.\nMcDermott was a nominee for the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award at the end of the season. Leeds endured a difficult season in 2016 as they were flooded out of their training ground for the first half of the season and suffered a run of injuries that left them having to fight against relegation in the Qualifiers. At the start of 2017, with only the addition of Matt Parcell to the Leeds squad from the previous year, they finished runners up to Castleford in the table. They then beat Castleford in the 2017 Grand Final at Old Trafford, with long-serving players Rob Burrow and Danny McGuire leaving the club as champions.\nAfter a run of seven losses in a row, the club sacked McDermott as head coach in July 2018.\nUnited States.\nIn 2015, McDermott was named head coach of the United States national team, combining the job with his role at Leeds. His first outing as coach of the USA Hawks was in the 2017 Rugby League World Cup qualifiers, in which he guided the United States to victories over Jamaica and Canada, and subsequently qualified for the 2017 World Cup. After qualifying for the tournament he announced he was to stay on as the US coach until at least the end of the 2017 World Cup.\nToronto Wolfpack.\nMcDermott took over at the Toronto Wolfpack ahead of the 2019 RFL Championship season.\nOldham RLFC.\nOn 5 July 2021 it was reported that he had joined Oldham as a coaching consultant to Brendan Sheridan, following the departure of former head coach Matt Diskin in June.\nFeatherstone Rovers.\nIt was reported on 22 October 2021 that he had taken over as head-coach from James Webster\nNewcastle Knights.\nMcDermott became assistant coach at the Newcastle Knights in November 2022, ahead of the 2023 NRL season in Australia."

        "title": "Armchair cricket",
        "text": "Armchair cricket is a card game that is inspired by the bat and ball sport cricket. It is played by either two or four people. Depending on the version of the game being played, a game can last a few minutes to several hours. It was produced commercially in England but is no longer made (although unused sets are still available for sale by private and specialist traders).\nThe cards.\nThe game is not played with a standard deck of playing cards. Two identical decks of 55 cards, comprising five suits of 11, are used instead (the 110 cards together are referred to as a pack). The suits are named after important pieces of cricketing equipment – bats, balls, stumps, gloves and pads – and numbered simply 1 to 11. The cards numbered 1 are called ‘dollies’ (cricketing slang for an easy catch) and those numbered 11 are called ‘beauts’ (referring to excellent deliveries or shots).\nBasic gameplay.\nIn the two player game, both players hold six cards, unseen by their opponent (one player may hold seven or eight cards as a way of evening up the odds where there is a wide difference in ability). One player will be ‘bowling’ and the other ‘batting’. The bowler plays a card – corresponding to bowling a delivery – and the batsman responds by playing a card – corresponding to playing a shot. Depending on the cards, the outcome may be runs for the batsman or a wicket to the bowler (or, of course, a dot ball).\nDifferent versions.\nThere are a number of versions of the game, which allow for games of varying length and intensity to be played.\nQuicket.\nThis is a fast, simple version, which might be thought of as an equivalent to French cricket. Only four of the five suits are used, and once the pack has been exhausted an innings is over (since there are 88 cards in this pack and a delivery requires a card to be played by both players, the maximum length of a Quicket innings is 44 balls). The standard way to play this version is for the innings to end immediately if a wicket falls.\nLimited overs.\nJust as in cricket, with one innings per team, innings ending with the fall of ten wickets or after the allotted overs have been bowled. When a pack is exhausted, the cards that have been played (the discard pile) are turned face down, shuffled and reused.\nFull cricket.\nEach team has two innings, with scores aggregated to determine the victor. Instead of the match length being determined by counting overs, it is done by counting how often packs are exhausted – players can think of a pack as representing half an hour of play. So, for instance, playing a five-day Test match involves 30 ‘hours’ of play, and so the pack needs to be exhausted 60 times.\nRules.\nWhen the batsman is faced with a delivery, he or she will be out by playing a card that is different in suit and lower in value. To score runs he or she needs to play a card that is in the same suit and higher in value. (Anything else is a dot ball.) The number of runs is determined by the difference in value. Roughly, if the batsman's card exceeds the bowler's by 1, 2 or 3, one run is scored; if by 4 or 5, two runs; if by 6, three runs; if by 7, 8, 9, four runs; if by 10, six runs. (So the only way to score a six is to play a beaut on a dolly.) There are some complications if other rules are being played, especially the two-card shot.\nThe manufacturer says that with this basic rule, a game can be played but the scores will be unrealistically low (compared to real cricket). There are a number of rules, which are best introduced gradually, which make the game more and more realistic (and require more sophisticated thinking from the players).\nThe most important are the no-ball rule, the extras, lower-order batsmen and the two-card shot.\nNo-ball rule.\nPlaying the basic rule only soon reveals that bowling is too easy (or batting is too difficult). The no-ball rule redresses this by reducing the number of cards that the bowler is allowed to use. Every over there is a no-ball suit, determined by the suit used by the bowler in the last delivery of the previous over. If a bowler plays a card in the no-ball suit then the batsman automatically gets a run, and is entitled to play any card without penalty. The bowler has to bowl an extra delivery. In fact, armchair cricket played simply with the no-ball rule is a challenging game and reasonable simulation of cricket already.\nThe extras.\nThese are more restrictions on the bowler. If the bowler bowls a card equal in value to the last card played then a wide is called, runs added to the batsman and the ball has to be bowled again. If, instead, the bowler's card exceeds the last card played by one, then byes are called (the number of byes or wides depends on the value of the bowler's card). The other extra from real cricket, the leg bye, is a feature of the two card shot.\nLower-order batsmen.\nTo simulate the fact that in real cricket some batsmen are worse than others, there are restrictions on the cards the batsman is allowed to use when the lower order batsmen are in play. Specifically, there are no extra restrictions on the first five batsmen, then the next three are not allowed to use dollies to defend a higher card in the same suit, and the last three batsmen cannot use dollies or twos to defend higher cards. There is no similar way of simulating different bowlers’ abilities.\nThe two-card shot.\nThis is a relatively complicated procedure, whereby the batsman plays two cards in response to the bowler's delivery, and forces the bowler to play another card, called the fielding card. With the two-card shot rule in place, armchair cricket can simulate several more features of the real game, including run outs, overthrows, out obstructing the field, out hit the ball twice and scrambled singles (called suicide singles).\nFour player games.\nThere are some differences in the four player game, where players play in pairs. The major differences are that for the batting side, each player holds seven cards not six, and represents one of the batsmen for the duration of that batsman's innings, whereas the two players on the bowling side always alternate overs. So in the course of one over a bowler may well bowl to both his or her opponents.\nKeeping score.\nBecause of the game's attempt to simulate real cricket so closely, players tend to keep score in much the same way as real cricket scorers do, performing the so-called ball by ball analysis onto a specially prepared scoring pad. In this way, individual batsmen's and bowler's performances can be given (e.g. scoring rate, number of runs conceded etc.). However, this is not vital for determining the result of the game. The bare minimum is to know how many balls have been bowled in the over, how far the game has progressed (in terms of overs or packs), the team's score, and which individual batsman is facing any particular delivery (if players are playing the lower-order batsmen rule). In the Quicket version, all that's needed is to keep track of the team's score, and (as suggested in the game's documentation) players can use the unused suit to display the score.\nSkill and luck.\nAlthough there is an element of luck in a game where you pick up cards face down from a shuffled deck, armchair cricket is a game of skill, and it is interesting to consider to what extent real cricketing knowledge and experience is useful in playing the game. Perhaps experience in how to pace an innings, especially in the limited overs version, is a relevant skill. The right time to make a declaration in the two innings version may be another example.\nRealism.\nBearing in mind the complicated nature of real cricket, in its technical details, armchair cricket does a remarkable job of simulating the game. There are many details which can be ignored by the players without affecting the game, or instead savoured by cricket fans who enjoy these details. For example, the precise values of the cards played allow players to distinguish between dot balls that are (i) defensive shots where the bat struck the ball, (ii) ‘leaves’ where the batsman deliberately does not strike the ball, and (iii) instances where the ball has ‘beaten the bat’ without taking a wicket. Whichever of these three possibilities is the case makes no substantial difference to the game, but the detail is there nevertheless for those who wish to know. Similarly, when a wicket falls there is a procedure for determining how the batsman was out (deciding between bowled, LBW, caught out etc.), but ultimately, the nature of the dismissal is irrelevant to the outcome of the game.\nFactors that are not simulated.\nThere are, of course, some aspects of the real game of cricket which are not simulated in armchair cricket, which players may like to think about how to incorporate into their house rules.\nWeather.\nRain does not stop play in armchair cricket, nor will umpires offer the batting team bad light.\nPitch conditions.\nPerhaps the most serious missing aspect is there is no simulation of pitch conditions. The rule book describes the act of looking at your cards at the start of the game after winning the toss as 'inspecting the pitch’, but unless you get to see your opponent's hand as well, this is not that realistic. The most serious drawback is that in a long two innings game, where traditionally the team batting last suffers on a deteriorating pitch, there is no real reason why in armchair cricket the fourth innings is any harder for the batting team than the previous three. Perhaps you could adapt the lower-order batsmen rule to make it harder in the latter stages of a game?\nBowler styles.\nIn real cricket, the bowler styles are varied and important, but there is no appreciable difference in the card game between a fast bowler, a wristy leg-spinner or a swing-and-seam merchant. (There is a very minor differentiation, which is that when a bowler takes a wicket that is caught behind, the bowler can decide it was a stumping if the bowler was a spinner.) This all ties up with earlier problems regarding weather and pitch conditions. One can imagine a complicated refinement to the rules where fast bowlers on bouncy pitches in sunny weather have the odds stacked slightly in their favour, or spinners have an advantage when bowling to left-handers in the fifth day of a test, but it would need a lot of playtesting and perhaps would not add much to the game.\nSetting the field.\nAn important role played by the captain of the fielding side in cricket is deciding where each of your teammates should stand - this affects the bowler's behaviour, how easy it is for the batsman to score runs, how risky certain shots are etc. There is no way of simulating this in armchair cricket, except to say that it falls under the general concept of how aggressively the bowler is bowling.\nFatigue.\nSimilarly to how the pitch does not deteriorate in armchair cricket, bowlers do not get tired. Nothing stops the bowling team using the same two bowlers for the entire duration of a Test match. When to deploy one's bowlers is a crucial part of the captain's role in real cricket, but is irrelevant in armchair cricket."

        "text": "The Fearsome Foursome was the dominating defensive line of the Los Angeles Rams of the 1960s and 1970s. Before them, the term had occasionally been applied to other defensive lines in the National Football League.\nNew York Giants.\nIn the 1957 season the \"New York Daily News\", a major New York city tabloid, ran an article and sketches of the New York Giants' line consisting of ends Andy Robustelli and Jim Katcavage, and tackles Rosey Grier and Dick Modzelewski and a headline that read \"A Fearsome Foursome.\"\nDetroit Lions.\nAnnouncer Van Patrick applied the nickname \"Fearsome Foursome\" to the Lions front four as early as 1960, when the Lion defensive line consisted of ends Bill Glass and Darris McCord, and tackles Alex Karras and Roger Brown.\nThe term was also used for the Detroit Lions defensive line after Sam Williams replaced Glass, who was traded to the Browns after the 1961 season.\nSan Diego Chargers.\nThe nickname \"Fearsome Foursome\" was also used to describe the American Football League's San Diego Chargers' defensive front four, including starters DE Ron Nery, DT Bill Hudson, DT Ernie Ladd, and DE Earl Faison. The Chargers moved to San Diego in 1961, and Faison made overall AFL Rookie of the Year, a rare feat for a defensive player. Alternate members of the group included DE Bob Petrich, DT George Gross, and DE-DT Henry Schmidt. At the time Gross and Ladd were two of the largest and strongest men in professional football. The Chargers' Foursome helped them reach the first two American Football League Championship games and five altogether, winning the AFL Championship in 1963 with a 51-10 thumping of the Boston Patriots.\nLos Angeles Rams.\nStill later, Rosey Grier was acquired from the New York Giants in 1963 to join Lamar Lundy, Merlin Olsen and Deacon Jones as the Los Angeles Rams starting defensive line. They also became known as the \"Fearsome Foursome\", and the greater publicity garnered by the NFL leads many to assume they were the originals. Dick Butkus called them \"the most dominant line in football history.\" They gained fame as the Rams went from a perennial under .500 team to an NFL powerhouse under coach George Allen.\nRoger Brown replaced Grier in 1967, and Diron Talbert replaced Brown in 1970. Also in 1970 Coy Bacon replaced Lamar Lundy.\nThe line was ultimately broken up when George Allen became coach of the Washington Redskins in 1971; Talbert and Jones left in 1972, with Talbert following Allen to the Redskins, and Jones going to the Chargers for two years before eventually reuniting with Allen himself on the Redskins in 1974. Bacon left in 1973. After missing the playoffs from 1970 to 1972, the Rams won seven straight division titles from 1973 to 1979, which was an NFL record until 2016 when broken by the New England Patriots. Those Rams teams were led in part by a reconstituted \"Fearsome Foursome.\"\nThis line consisted of ends Jack Youngblood and Fred Dryer, and tackles Olsen and Larry Brooks. Youngblood and Olsen are NFL Hall of Famers while Brooks made the Pro Bowl 5 times. Dryer, acquired from the Giants in 1972, also made the Pro Bowl once, and set an NFL record with 2 safeties in one game vs. the Packers. Olsen, who played with his brother Phil Olsen for 4 seasons from 1971 to 1974, retired after a 15-year career at the end of the 1976 season. He was replaced by Mike Fanning, who with Youngblood, Dryer and Brooks started in Super Bowl XIV following the 1979 season. \nThe line was documented in NFL Network's \"A Football Life,\" and was narrated by Josh Charles."

The springboard is usually about wide and long.\nDevelopment of a new type of springboard began in the 1930s. Named 'Reuther boards' after their inventor, Richard Reuther, they allowed gymnasts to gain more speed and height when vaulting. The first Olympics they were used in was the 1956 Summer Olympics. After boards with springs were introduced, for a time, which was type of board was used varied by competition, as the regulations did not specify. The 1991 World Championships used springboards, while the 1992 Summer Olympics used Reuther boards. \nAt modern competitions, two kinds of springboards are provided, a 'hard' board and a 'soft' board. Gymnasts may choose between the hard and soft boards for vault, but they may only choose to use the soft board on other events. "

He was named the EuroLeague MVP in 2009, and the EuroLeague Final Four MVP in 2010.\nMemphis Grizzlies (2007–2008).\nAs a member of FC Barcelona, Navarro played with players like Sasha Đjorđjević, Artūras Karnišovas, Rony Seikaly, Pau Gasol, and Šarūnas Jasikevičius, which helped make him a better player, and he became one of the most promising young European players, early on in his career with Barcelona. Several NBA mock drafts started to set him as a projected NBA draft pick.\nIn the 2001–02 season, Navarro was plagued by injuries, which dropped his NBA draft stock. Eventually, the Washington Wizards drafted Navarro in the second round (with the 40th pick overall) of the 2002 NBA draft. Navarro subsequently declined the Wizards contract offer, as he preferred to stay with FC Barcelona.\nOn August 3, 2007, the Washington Wizards traded Navarro's draft rights, to the Memphis Grizzlies, in exchange for a future first-round draft pick. Navarro would later be reunited with his former FC Barcelona and Spain national teammate Pau Gasol, on the Grizzlies. After securing his €10 million contract buyout with FC Barcelona, Navarro signed a one-year contract with the Memphis Grizzlies of the NBA, and he played with them during the 2007–08 season.\nIn his rookie NBA season, Navarro was one of the Grizzlies' team leaders in three-point shooting (.361). He was also named to the 2007–08 NBA All-Rookie Second Team, after averaging 10.9 points per game. On June 18, 2008, Navarro decided to leave the NBA and return to Spain. He signed a four-year deal worth €12 million net income (with an optional fifth year that would bring the total contract to €15 million net income) with Barcelona, his former team. A qualifying contract offer, that had been previously tendered to Navarro by the Memphis Grizzlies, was eventually rescinded by the team on September 10, 2009. That allowed the Grizzlies the cap space to then sign Allen Iverson.\nNavarro's final NBA game was played on April 16, 2008, in a 111 - 120 loss to the Denver Nuggets where he recorded 16 points, 7 assists, 4 rebounds and 2 steals.\nReturn to FC Barcelona (2008–2018).\nAfter spending the 2007–08 season in the NBA, with the Memphis Grizzlies, Navarro returned to FC Barcelona in the summer of 2008, on a 4-year €12 million net income contract. The contract included a €10 million buyout amount. The contract also included an optional fifth year, which brought the total contract to €15 million net income. In 2012, Barcelona picked up the fifth optional year of his contract (€3 million net income), and extended him for another two additional years, at a salary of €2.6 million per season after that, bringing the total to €8.2 million net income over three years.\nOver the 2014–15 season, Navarro experienced several injury problems with his right leg. In late December 2014, it was announced that he would miss up to six weeks of action, due to a torn muscle in his right thigh. On June 29, 2015, it was announced by Barcelona that Navarro would miss three months of game action, due to plantar fasciitis on his right foot. Those injuries negatively impacted his performances over the season, in which he had averages of 10.5 points and 3.1 assists per game, on 37% shooting from the field overall, in 17 EuroLeague 2014–15 season games.\nOn August 17, 2018, Navarro retired from competing in active sports competition, and he joined the FC Barcelona club's head office structure. That fulfilled what had been previously established in the 10-year contract that he signed with the club in September 2017 - that he would join the club's front office, after he retired from playing basketball with the team.\nAt the time of his retirement from playing professional basketball, Navarro was the EuroLeague's all-time career leader in total Performance Index Rating (PIR) (that record was eventually broken by Vassilis Spanoulis), and also the league's career leader in total points scored (4,152 points) in the modern Euroleague Basketball era of the competition, since the year 2000 (that record was also eventually broken by Spanoulis). Navarro also retired as the all-time career leader in total points scored (4,321 points), in the entire history of the EuroLeague (since 1958), including when the competition was run by FIBA Europe, as he also scored 169 total points in the FIBA EuroLeague 1999–00 season. In March 2019, Navarro's number 11 jersey was retired by the club.\nNational team career.\nIn the summer of 1998, Navarro was a member of the Spanish under-18 junior national team that won the gold medal at the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship. He was also one of \"The Golden Generation\" boys of Spain (along with Felipe Reyes and future NBA players Pau Gasol and Raúl López) that defeated the United States' junior national team at the 1999 FIBA Under-19 World Cup.\nNavarro played with the senior Spanish national team at the 2000 Sydney Summer Olympics. He also played at the 2001 EuroBasket, where he won two games during the tournament with buzzer-beaters. He scored 27 points during the bronze medal game against Germany. At the 2003 EuroBasket in Sweden, Navarro won a silver medal with the Spain's national team.\nIn Spain's seventh-place finish at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics, he scored 18 points in Spain's loss against Team USA. At the 2005 EuroBasket, the Spanish national team, playing without Pau Gasol, finished in fourth place. Navarro was the second leading scorer of the tournament, with an average of 25.2 points per game, finishing behind only Dirk Nowitzki. In August 2006, he played on the Spanish national team that won the gold medal at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, after they defeated Greece in the tournament's final; after the Greeks had earlier defeated Team USA, in their semifinal, by a score of 101–95.\nIn September 2007, Navarro and Spain lost against Russia, in the gold medal game at the 2007 EuroBasket, which was held in Madrid, on Spain's home floor. Navarro was a member of Spain's national team that won the silver medal at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics. Navarro scored 18 points in the gold medal game that Spain lost against Team USA.\nNavarro was part of the Spain's national team that won the 2009 Eurobasket. As the defending champions, Spain retained their European crown at the 2011 EuroBasket. Navarro led his team with a game-high 27 points in the championship game over France. He earned All-Tournament Team accolades, along with his teammate, Pau Gasol, and he was named the EuroBasket MVP.\nNavarro won a silver medal with Spain at the 2012 London Summer Olympics. He also played at the 2014 FIBA World Cup, at the 2016 Rio Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal, and at the 2017 EuroBasket, where he also won a bronze medal.\nPost-playing career.\nAfter Navarro retired from playing professional basketball in August 2018, he began working in the front office of the Spanish Liga ACB club FC Barcelona. In April 2021, he was appointed by President Joan Laporta as Team Manager in replacement of Nacho Rodríguez.\nCareer statistics.\nEuroLeague.\n! colspan=\"14\" | FIBA EuroLeague \n! colspan=\"14\" | \"Spent the 1998–99 season in the FIBA Korać Cup competition\"\n! colspan=\"14\" | EuroLeague \n! colspan=\"14\" | \"Spent the 2007–08 season in the NBA with the Memphis Grizzlies\" "

        "text": "Peter Randy Mueller (born April 14, 1988) is an American professional ice hockey forward, currently playing for Grizzlys Wolfsburg in the Deutsche Eishockey Liga (DEL). He has previously played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Phoenix Coyotes, Colorado Avalanche and the Florida Panthers.\nPlaying career.\nMueller was drafted 8th overall by the Phoenix Coyotes in the 2006 NHL Entry Draft. He plays as a center. He played in the USA Hockey developmental program for the 2004–05 season before moving to the Western Hockey League's Everett Silvertips. Because of his outstanding performances in the first half of the 2007–08 season, Mueller was selected to play in the 2008 NHL YoungStars Game in Atlanta. He netted his first career NHL hat-trick against the Anaheim Ducks on November 7, 2007.\nMueller's 2008–09 season was a small disappointment as he couldn't replicate his 54 point performance of 2007–08, recording 36 points in 72 games.\nIn the 2009–10 season, Mueller's production further sagged, leading to a request to be traded. Mueller scored 17 points in 54 games before on March 12, 2010, he was traded by the Coyotes, along with Kevin Porter, to the Colorado Avalanche for Wojtek Wolski. Later that day Mueller made his Avalanche debut, scoring a goal in a 4–3 victory over the Anaheim Ducks. In just 15 games with the Avs, after a 5–4 overtime victory against the San Jose Sharks in which he scored two goals and an assist, Mueller had already eclipsed his offensive production he managed to register with the Coyotes for the entire season before the trade.\nOn September 10, 2010, the Avalanche signed Mueller to a two year, $4 million deal. He suffered a concussion in an Avalanche regular season game against San Jose late in the 2010 season. He suffered it as a result of a hard check by former Avalanche defenseman, Rob Blake. He suffered another concussion in the last week of the 2010–11 preseason and was put on injured reserve.\nMueller made an anticipated return after a year of absence in the beginning of the 2011–12 season, but post-concussion syndromes forced him to the IR again. On November 25, 2011 it was reported that Mueller, who has been dealing with post-concussion symptoms, now had a groin injury as well. On January 12, 2012, he made another return in a 3–2 OT loss against the Nashville Predators. He scored his first points in almost 2 years on January 18, when he scored two goals and added an assist against the Florida Panthers in a 4–3 OT win.\nAt the conclusion of his two-year contract with the Avalanche, in which both were decimated by injury, Mueller failed to receive a qualifying offer prior to the opening of NHL free agency on July 1, 2012, making him an unrestricted free agent. On July 11, 2012 Mueller signed a one-year, $1.725 million contract with the Florida Panthers.\nDespite a lockout shortened 2012–13 season, Mueller returned to full health for the first time since 2010, and featured in 43 games. After initially succeeding on a scoring line alongside eventual Calder Memorial Trophy winner, Jonathan Huberdeau and veteran Alexei Kovalev, Mueller slowed in his offensive output to finish with 8 goals and 17 points with the Panthers.\nUnable to agree on a new contract with Florida, and with limited NHL interest, Mueller signed his first European contract on a one-year deal with Swiss club, Kloten Flyers of the National League A on September 6, 2013. In the 2013–14 season, Mueller played a full season to lead the club and finish third in NLA scoring with 46 points. At the conclusion of the season, Mueller accepted an invitation and played for the U.S. at the 2014 IIHF World Championships in Belarus.\nIn March 2014, Mueller stated in an interview that he is interested in returning to the NHL following his stay in Switzerland with the Flyers. On July 29, 2014, Mueller and the St. Louis Blues agreed to terms on a one-year, two-way contract. On October 8, 2014, after failing to make the Blues roster, Mueller and the club announced the termination of his contract so he could explore his options to play in Europe. On October 10, 2014, Mueller expectedly returned to his previous club in signing a one-year contract with the Kloten Flyers. On March 20, 2015, the Kloten Flyers decided not to offer him a contract extension after tailing only 17 points in the 2014–15 NLA season.\nOn August 12, 2015, Mueller remained in Europe as a free agent, and signed a one-year deal with Swedish club, Malmö Redhawks of the Swedish Hockey League. In the 2015–16 season, Mueller quickly adapted to the Swedish League and contributed offensively with 13 goals and 25 points in 43 games with the Redhawks.\nOn September 7, 2016, Mueller as a free agent agreed to another attempt to re-ignite his NHL career in signing a professional try-out with the Boston Bruins, expected to attend their training camp at Warrior Ice Arena in Boston, Massachusetts. On October 2, 2016, Mueller was released from his try-out contract with Boston, however he accepted an offer with AHL affiliate, the Providence Bruins to begin the 2016–17 season on a professional try-out contract. He played the entirety of season with Providence, collecting 13 goals and 25 points in 56 games.\nAs a free agent the following off-season, Mueller returned to Europe in belatedly signing a one-year deal with Austrian outfit, EC Red Bull Salzburg of the EBEL, on September 20, 2017. Now, he is playing for HC Kometa Brno (Czech republic)"

        "title": "SummerSlam (1988)",
        "text": "The 1988 SummerSlam was the inaugural SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on August 29, 1988, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. The pay-per-view was created to help the company compete against rival promotion Jim Crockett Promotions. It was one of the first four annual pay-per-view events produced by the WWF, along with WrestleMania, the Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, which were eventually dubbed the \"big four\".\nThe event consisted of 10 professional wrestling matches. The preliminary matches included a title defense by Intercontinental Champion The Honky Tonk Man against a surprise challenger, revealed to be The Ultimate Warrior. The Ultimate Warrior won the match in just 31 seconds to end Honky Tonk's 14-month title reign, at the time the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in history. The main event was a match pitting The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage) against their long-time rivals, The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant). Hogan and Savage won the match after Miss Elizabeth, Savage's manager, distracted André and DiBiase, by removing her skirt to reveal her panties.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nIn the late 1980s, the World Wrestling Federation's (WWF, now WWE) main competition in the professional wrestling industry was from the National Wrestling Alliance's (NWA) Jim Crockett Promotions. WWF Chairman Vince McMahon countered Jim Crockett's successful Starrcade pay-per-view (PPV), which began airing in 1983, by creating WrestleMania. After WrestleMania III in March 1987, the most successful professional wrestling pay-per-view event in history, McMahon created Survivor Series, which aired the same day as Starrcade in November 1987. After defeating Crockett in the ratings war, McMahon created the Royal Rumble, an event airing for free on the USA Network in January 1988, on the same night as the Crockett produced PPV Bunkhouse Stampede. The event set a ratings record for the network with eight million households tuning in to watch the event. In retaliation, Crockett created the Clash of the Champions I event, which aired simultaneously with WrestleMania IV. WrestleMania IV garnered higher ratings, and not long after, Crockett filed for bankruptcy and sold his company to Ted Turner, who rebranded it as World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\nAs the WWF continued to replace its closed circuit programming with pay-per-view programming, McMahon added more pay-per-views to the lineup to capitalize on the success of his previous events. In addition to WrestleMania in March, Royal Rumble in January, and Survivor Series in November, McMahon created an event for August, which he named SummerSlam. It was scheduled to be held on August 29, 1988, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. To keep the WWF from having a pay-per-view market monopoly, Turner began airing monthly WCW pay-per-views. As a result, both companies brought in hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue.\nStorylines.\nPrior to SummerSlam, The Honky Tonk Man had been the longest reigning Intercontinental Champion in WWF history. He was originally supposed to defend his championship against Brutus Beefcake, but Beefcake was unable to compete as a result of a (storyline) injury received from \"Outlaw\" Ron Bass the week before.\nAlso prior to the event, Demolition (Ax and Smash) held the WWF World Tag Team Championship, which they had won at WrestleMania IV after only a year in the WWF, and would defend their titles at SummerSlam against former champions The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart), who had become fan favorites a few weeks earlier by turning on their manager Jimmy Hart.\nThe on-screen feud between Rick Rude and Jake Roberts began weeks before SummerSlam. As part of his gimmick, Rude would—after winning a match—invite a pre-selected woman from the audience to kiss him in the ring. On one occasion, one of the women refused to comply, later identifying herself as Roberts' wife, Cheryl. As the feud intensified, Rude began wearing a pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl stenciled on them, prompting a furious Roberts to charge into the ring and strip the tights off Rude, appearing to television viewers to leave Rude naked, although the live audience saw him stripped to a G-string instead.\nFor months prior to the pay-per-view, Hulk Hogan and undisputed WWF Heavyweight Champion Randy Savage, two of the WWF's top crowd favorites, had feuded with André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, respectively. The two feuds first came together at WrestleMania IV, when—as the result of the vacating of the WWF Heavyweight Championship—a 14-man single-elimination tournament was set up to crown a new champion. Hogan and André had been disqualified in their quarterfinal match, while Savage and DiBiase reached the championship match; in that final match, Savage defeated DiBiase with help from Hogan. Savage and DiBiase feuded over the title throughout the spring and summer, but André did not become involved until mid-summer when he and DiBiase helped instigate a 2-on-1 attack against Savage as he was delivering a promo. Savage quickly recovered and challenged André and DiBiase to a tag team match against him and a partner to be named. That partner later was revealed to be Hogan; the team became known as \"The Mega Powers.\" The André-DiBiase team—which dubbed itself \"The Mega Bucks\"—retaliated by announcing the guest referee would be someone they declared to be fair and neutral: Jesse Ventura, a color commentator on the WWF's programs who favored the villains, though according to the main storyline, Ventura was chosen by WWF President Jack Tunney as the only person capable of handling such a match.\nEvent.\nThe event began with a match between The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy Smith and Dynamite Kid) and The Fabulous Rougeaus (Jacques and Raymond Rougeau). As soon as the bell rang to signify that the match had begun, Smith attacked Jacques. The two teams traded blows until The Rougeaus flipped Dynamite Kid over their heads so that he fell on his back to the mat. Dynamite Kid escaped another offensive maneuver before tagging in his partner, Smith, and The British Bulldogs performed a double-team maneuver on Jacques. Despite having the upper hand, The Bulldogs failed to pin Jacques in time, and the match ended in a twenty-minute time draw.\nThe next match was between Bad News Brown and Ken Patera. Before the bell rang, however, Brown attacked Patera, who retaliated by performing a clothesline from the corner. Patera then slipped both of his arms underneath Brown's armpits and locked his hands behind his neck, using a submission move known as a full nelson. At the end of the match, Brown defeated Patera by striking him in the back of the head with his finishing move, the Ghetto Blaster.\nAfter the second match ended, Rick Rude and the Junkyard Dog made their way to the ring. Their match began as Rude attacked Junkyard Dog from behind, who retaliated by headbutting Rude several times. Subsequently, Rude climbed to the wrestling ring's top rope and pulled down his tights to reveal another pair of tights with a picture of Cheryl Roberts on them. As a result, Jake Roberts, Cheryl Roberts' husband, ran to the ring and attacked Rude, forcing the referee to disqualify the Junkyard Dog.\nThe next match was a tag team match between The Powers of Pain (The Barbarian and The Warlord), who were accompanied by their manager The Baron, and The Bolsheviks (Boris Zhukov and Nikolai Volkoff), who were accompanied by Slick. Immediately, The Powers of Pain chased The Bolsheviks from the ring. Slick, however, distracted The Powers of Pain long enough to give The Bolsheviks an advantage. Zhukov was then slammed to the mat back-first and headbutted from the top rope, which allowed The Barbarian to pin him.\nThe fifth match of the event was an Intercontinental Championship match between The Ultimate Warrior and the reigning champion The Honky Tonk Man, who was accompanied by Jimmy Hart. Before the match, it had been announced that Honky's original challenger, Brutus Beefcake, was unable to wrestle due to being attacked the previous week on an episode of \"Superstars of Wrestling\" by Outlaw Ron Bass who had raked his cowboy spurs repeatedly across Beefcake's forehead (television and even the PPV only showed the censored version of the attack). Prior to the match, the Honky Tonk Man refused to be informed about Beefcake's replacement and immediately before the match, even grabbed ring announcer Howard Finkel's microphone and said \"Give me someone out here to wrestle, I don't care who it is\". His challenge was answered by The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior, who accidentally knocked Finkel to the floor when he rushed into the ring and hit the ropes, had the advantage from the beginning, attacking The Honky Tonk Man, who was still in his entrance attire. After body-slamming him to the mat and following it up with a clothesline, The Warrior bounded to the ropes and landed stomach-first on The Honky Tonk Man using his signature move, the Warrior Splash. The Ultimate Warrior then pinned The Honky Tonk Man after only thirty-one seconds to win the title. The longest Intercontinental title reign in WWF history had ended with one of the shortest IC title matches in history. Honky's reign would be the longest Intercontinental Championship reign in WWE history until Gunther broke the record in September 2023.\nThe following contest was a re-match from WrestleMania IV between Dino Bravo and \"The Rock\" Don Muraco. Muraco, the crowd favorite, was in control for most of the match until Bravo's manager Frenchy Martin distracted Muraco, allowing Bravo to use his side suplex and pin him for the win. The Rock had gone into the match without his manager Superstar Billy Graham, who could only look on helplessly from his position in the commentary booth alongside Gorilla Monsoon at the illegal antics of Bravo and Martin.\nThe seventh match of the night was for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Reigning champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), accompanied by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart, were challenged by The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). As soon as the bell sounded, The Hart Foundation attacked both members of Demolition. Their control was brief, as Demolition then gained the advantage over Neidhart. As Bret Hart was tagged into the match, Demolition got the advantage over him when he was whipped shoulder first into the turnbuckle, breaking Mr. Fuji's cane that he had placed there when the referee wasn't looking. After a few minutes of Demolition working over Hart's shoulder, a frustrated Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match. When all four men began fighting inside the ring, Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji, who was on the ring apron. At the end of the match, Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him a megaphone given by Jimmy Hart sneaking back to the ring. Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win.\nThe next match was between the Big Boss Man, accompanied by Slick, and \"The Bird Man\" Koko B. Ware. With Slick as a distraction, the Big Boss Man took the early advantage in the match. After crushing Koko in between himself and the turnbuckle with a jumping Avalanche, Boss Man refused to pin him and finish the match. Instead, he attempted to climb to the top rope and land on Koko stomach-first, but missed. The Bird Man then retaliated by performing several dropkicks and attempted a pin. Boss Man got his shoulder up to save himself from being pinned, and he slammed his opponent into the mat, allowing him to pin Koko for the win.\nThe second to last match of the night was between Jake Roberts and Hercules. When Roberts attempted to slam his opponent's head on to the mat with a DDT, Hercules was able to escape the maneuver and take control of the match. As Hercules attempted to slam Roberts to the mat, Roberts reversed the move into a DDT, enabling him to pin Hercules for the win.\nThe last match of the night was the main event between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), accompanied by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, who was on the ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal a one-piece swimsuit. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.\nReception.\nThe event was produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and took place on August 29, 1988, in New York City's Madison Square Garden. The pay-per-view had a 4.5 buyrate, which means that 4.5% of pay-per-view subscribers ordered the event.\nThe original plan for SummerSlam was to bring Ric Flair over from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to the WWF. Vince McMahon, the owner of the WWF, wanted Flair to challenge Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship. Flair, however, felt obliged to the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF. Therefore, Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on-screen rivals. Flair would not join the WWF until 1991.\nIn WWE.com's 2007 list of the top ten SummerSlam moments in history, The Ultimate Warrior's Intercontinental Championship title win was listed as number ten, while Miss Elizabeth's distraction during the main event was listed at number nine.\nCalum Waddell, in \"Fighting Spirit Magazine\", called The Ultimate Warrior's win over the Honky Tonk Man \"genuinely captivating,\" and he said the match between The British Bulldogs and The Fabulous Rougeaus was an \"exciting battle\". In contrast, he had a negative reaction to the main event match, citing it as \"predictably one-dimensional\" and \"abysmal\". Similarly, Adam Nedeff of \"411Mania\" called the tag team match between The British Bulldogs and The Rougeaus \"a solid match\" but stated that the \"lack of a finish was a disappointment\". Although he reviewed most of the matches negatively, he called the WWF World Tag Team Championship match a \"good match\". Overall, he rated the event a 4.5 out of 10 and stated, \"Without Warrior's big win and Elizabeth's surprise finish, this is a totally forgettable show\".\nAftermath.\nOn October 16, 1988, Ted Dibiase defeated Randy Savage in the finals of the King of The Ring Tournament. The Mega Powers continued to team together after the event, until a new storyline was developed where Randy Savage became jealous over Hulk Hogan paying attention to Miss Elizabeth, and as the WWF World Heavyweight Champion felt slighted over his perceived lower billing in the Mega Powers' pecking order. Several key events were developed to foreshadow their burgeoning feud; these included Hogan asking Elizabeth to accompany him to televised matches, where he would act overly friendly with her and accidentally eliminating Savage from the Royal Rumble in January 1989 by knocking him over the top rope and to the floor. The final falling out happened on \"The Main Event II\", when Elizabeth received an on-screen injury during a tag team match. Savage, left alone in the ring while Hogan tended to Elizabeth, attacked Hogan backstage. This rivalry culminated in a match for Savage's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V, where Hogan won the title by pinning Savage.\nAs WWF Intercontinental Champion, the Ultimate Warrior began receiving more on-air time and more prominent matches. His feud with the Honky Tonk Man continued for several months, until Warrior was placed in a new feud with Rick Rude in early 1989.\nAfter retaining their title against The Hart Foundation, Demolition held the WWF Tag Team Championship for another 11 months, as part of a record-breaking 16-month reign as champions, before eventually losing the title to The Brain Busters (Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson) on \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXII\". During the midst of their title reign, despite being billed as villains, Demolition's popularity with fans continued to grow, and the tag team eventually was turned face 3 months after SummerSlam at the 1988 Survivor Series.\nSeveral of the WWF's stars from the beginning of its national expansion in 1984 slowly began leaving the promotion over the next few months, including Ken Patera, Junkyard Dog, The British Bulldogs (particularly Dynamite Kid) and Don Muraco as the WWF began focusing on new talent such as Bad News Brown, Rick Rude, the Ultimate Warrior, the Powers of Pain, and the Brain Busters (who would arrive in October 1988).\nLater in 1988, The Big Boss Man would join forces with the One Man Gang (who by then had changed his character to Akeem, hailing from \"Deepest Darkest Africa\") to form the tag team called \"The Twin Towers\".\nThe Bolsheviks began to fall down the tag team ranks, losing in feuds with the Powers of Pain and later from the newly arrived Bushwhackers. \nFollowing the inaugural 1988 event, SummerSlam became one of the WWF's most successful events as well as one of the WWF's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Survivor Series, and Royal Rumble, which were eventually dubbed the \"Big Four\". Those four events, along with King of the Ring introduced in 1993, were known as the \"Classic Five\" (or \"Big Five\") until 2002, as the King of the Ring PPV was discontinued after 2002. In August 2021, Money in the Bank joined the four to become part of the \"Big Five\". SummerSlam has also been referred to as \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", and eventually became the promotion's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. In May 2002, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), and the \"WWE\" abbreviation became an orphaned initialism in April 2011. SummerSlam continued to be held in August every year until 2022, as that year's event was scheduled to be held in July. However, the 2023 event returned to August."

        "text": "The real time strategy (RTS) computer game \"StarCraft\" had an active professional competition circuit, particularly in South Korea. The two major game channels in South Korea, Ongamenet and MBCGame, each ran a Starleague (Ongamenet Starleague, MBCgame Starleague), viewed by millions of fans.\nStarting in about 2003, pro-gamers started to become organized into teams, sponsored by large South Korean companies like Samsung, SK Telecom and KT. \"StarCraft\" is also the most popular computer game competition during the annual World Cyber Games thanks to its Korean fanbase, and it is overall one of the world's largest computer and video game competitions in terms of prize money, global coverage and participants.\nOver US$4,000,000 in prize money has been awarded in total, the vast majority of which comes from tournaments in South Korea. For several years after the release of ', competitive ' was no longer televised. However, in early 2015, the game returned to Ongamenet's televised lineup.\nThe game's professional competition has remained largely separate from that of StarCraft II, though both games' current largest Korean competitions, the Afreeca StarCraft League (ASL) and Global StarCraft II League (GSL), are organized by Afreeca TV. Players have transitioned between the two throughout the years, but outside of the transitional 2012 season of Proleague, none have competed professionally in both at the same time.\nParticipation outside of South Korea.\nThere have been several commercial attempts to bring televised professional StarCraft matches to audiences outside South Korea. GOM TV hired Nick \"Tasteless\" Plott, an American who previously cast StarCraft at the WCG and other international events, to provide English commentary for the 2008 GOM TV Star Invitational and the 2008 Averatec-Intel Classic tournaments. According to GOM TV statistics, over 1 million viewers watched the GOM TV Star Invitational matches with English commentary.\nMany StarCraft fans outside South Korea download video files of the pro games to watch on their computer. This has spawned a small community wherein StarCraft fans post the files to video sharing sites such as YouTube, but with their own English commentaries dubbed alongside the original Korean commentary. Notable English-speaking YouTube commentators include Day9, KlazartSC, Diggity, Moletrap, NukeTheStars, and Rise.\nThe Collegiate Starleague is a seasonal intercollegiate league that is modeled after Korea's ProLeague. It was founded in 2009 by students at Princeton University. Its fourth season (Fall 2010) marks a shift from to , and includes the participation of over 100 North American colleges including Harvard University, Yale University, Cornell University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Rutgers University, and Case Western Reserve University. Notable contributors and players include Sean \"Day[9]\" Plott, Kevin \"QXC\" Riley, and Andre \"Gretorp\" Hengchua.\nList of professional \"StarCraft\" teams.\nThe Korean professional scene was divided into eight teams, six of which were sponsored by corporations, and the remaining team by the Korean Air Force. All teams dissolved or transitioned to StarCraft II in 2012.\nAs a result of the match-fixing scandal all teams except for Jin air green wings has disbanded.\nMatch fixing scandal.\nA cheating scandal in the sport came to light in South Korea on 13 April 2010, when it was found that popular \"StarCraft\" players were intentionally losing games. As professional gaming has a legal status in South Korea, the consequences of these actions was severe: 11 players were banned from all professional StarCraft competition for life, and faced civil and criminal lawsuits. All eleven players had all prizes and rewards revoked (e.g. Player of the Year Reward, Proleague Player Reward, Weekly/Monthly MVP Reward)\nAs of 9 June 2010, eleven Players have been banned from programing as a result of the scandal: sAviOr, Hwasin, go.go, Type-b, Luxury, YellOw (ArnC)*, DarkElf, UpMaGiC, Justin, By.1st and ShinHwA. In October 2010, sentences were declared.\nThe suspended sentences mean the players can avoid prison if no wrongdoing is committed within the time period.\nTransition to \"StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty\".\nDespite the release of \"\", KeSPA, OGN and MBC Game decided to stick with \"Brood War\" for their competitions. KeSPA and OGN eventually came into talks with Blizzard and GomTV for broadcasting rights of \"StarCraft II\". After discussions and negotiations were complete, it was announced that the SK Planet Proleague season would be a hybrid tournament featuring both Brood War and StarCraft II. \"Brood War\" professional competition was eventually phased out entirely in Proleague, although fan interest in the game continued.\nResurgence and \"StarCraft: Remastered\".\n\"Brood War\" tournaments with cash prizes continued to be run following KeSPA's exit from the scene. In 2014, two years after professional KeSPA-sanctioned \"StarCraft\" competition ended, OGN once again televised StarCraft competition for two seasons. Starting in 2016, Afreeca TV began running the Afreeca StarCraft League (ASL) alongside their StarCraft II event, the Global StarCraft II League (GSL). In 2017, Blizzard announced ', a graphical and systems update to \"StarCraft: Brood War\" that left the gameplay completely untouched. Following the release of \"StarCraft: Remastered\", the scene had no trouble transitioning as the game remained exactly the same in terms of gameplay and only had its graphics and matchmaking improved, which didn't affect professional players. In 2018, coinciding with \"StarCrafts 20th anniversary, Blizzard announced their own league, the Korea StarCraft League (KSL), bringing the number of professional individual leagues for \"StarCraft: Brood War\", now \"StarCraft: Remastered\", in Korea back to two for the first time since 2011 when the last season of MSL was played.\nNotable professional players.\nTerran.\nLim Yo-Hwan (SlayerS_`BoxeR`).\nKnown as the \"Emperor of Terran\", or sometimes just \"The Emperor\", Boxer's creative play helped him to be the first (of two) \"StarCraft\" player to win the World Cyber Games (WCG) twice. He has also won the Ongamenet Starleague (OSL) twice (only eight other players have achieved that). He is the first of three players to win two consecutive OSLs. He holds the record for being number 1 in KeSPA's rankings for 17 consecutive months. Boxer made a comeback in 2005, winning second place in the So1 OSL 2005, but had to retire from professional gaming to join the Korean military service, which is mandatory for all Korean males. On 3 October 2006 he played his rival [NC]...Yellow in \"Superfight\", which he won 3–2. One of the most popular fights with [NC]Yellow was Boxer's Famous SCV rush, where he sent his SCV's and a couple of marines and won in five minutes. His total record of televised matches before he joined the Korean Air Force was 500 wins and 338 losses.\nBoxer became one of the first members of the Korean Air Force pro-gaming team ACE (an acronym of Air Force Challenges E-sports), where he continued playing as a pro-gamer. He made the GomTV 2 MBC Game Starleague in 2007, but was eliminated in the group stages. When his air force contract expired on 24 December 2008, he rejoined his former team SK Telecom T1, appearing actively in Pro League in July 2009. In October 2010 he switched over to StarCraft 2 and competed in GomTV GSL 2. In November 2010 he retired from his KeSPA pro-gamer status to only focus on SC2 and have the opportunity to form a new SC2-team sponsored by Intel.\nLee Yun-Yeol ([ReD]NaDa).\nThe \"Genius Terran\" (also known as \"Tornado Terran\") started his pro-gaming career by beating ChRh (Choi In Kyu) on the \"Amateur vs Pro\" TV show. He has a consistent and dominating style, backed up with excellent macro. A strong micro among all \"StarCraft\" players (e.g. Nada's Vultures), Nada's infantry army had good performance. He has been on the team IS, KTF and now the Wemade FOX, formerly Pantech EX, formerly known as Toona SG. Nada has won 3 OSLs, 3 MSLs, and the first KT-KTF invitational tournament. After a resurgent OSL victory in late 2006, NaDa became the first player to have won the OSL three times, winning the \"Golden Mouse\". He recently qualified for his tenth MSL, but failed to qualify for the next OSL. Nada managed to reach the final sixteen in both the 2008 MSL and OSL, but was stifled of another attempt at a trophy by Hwasin and Jangbi respectively. As of December 2008 he is ranked 18 in KeSPA. As of June 2009, Nada has fallen to rank 31 in the KeSPA ranking system, making it the first time that he has been out of the top 30 since March 2002.\nIn October 2010 after his contract ended, he retired from playing StarCraft: Brood War professionally instead NaDa is currently pursuing a professional gaming career in StarCraft 2: Wings of Liberty. NaDa joined the StarCraft II team, Complexity Gaming, but announced his retirement in June 2012 due to financial difficulty, current poor state of health pending military issues, and various family issues.\nChoi Yeon-Sung (iloveoov).\nThe next successful Terran player after Boxer and Nada, iloveoov's macro is even better than Nada's, leading to him being known as the \"Cheater Terran\" due to his ability to create large armies in a short span of time. He is also known as \"Monster\" because of his dominance over his opponents. He has won the MBCGame Starleague (MSL) three times in succession, and in November 2004 finally won the OSL. He won his 2nd OSL title in March 2006, defeating JulyZerg in the 1st ShinHan Bank tournament. iloveoov has now retired from professional gaming and is currently a coach for the SKT1 squad with Kingdom. However, in November 2008, he declared he would come back to the squad and works as coach in SKT. His first coming back game was held 17 November. He played against Kim Myung Un (Zerg) and lost, himself using Valiath (Valkyrie+Goliath). He has a relationship with Boxer (who was on the same SK Telecom T1 team with him), as he sees Boxer as a kind of \"older brother\" or mentor (Boxer brought iloveoov to the professional scene after seeing his talent in amateur leagues), and as a result, was somewhat regretful for beating him (3–2) in the finals of the EVER OSL in November 2004. He also won the WCG in 2006, beating Julyzerg 2–1 in the finals.\nLee Young-Ho (Flash).\nNicknamed \"The Little Monster\", \"God-Young-Ho\", and \"Ultimate Weapon\", Flash arrived in the gaming scene by defeating Bisu in a Starleague game by \"cheesing\" his opponent. He was heavily criticized by StarCraft fans as a \"cheap\" player, but he dispelled all accusations by dominating the StarCraft gaming scene. He propelled his team KTF (now KT Rolster) into Proleague victories and championships by winning the 2010 Proleague. Flash is involved in a rivalry with Jaedong. Flash holds world records such as longest TvT winning streak, longest TvP winning streak, youngest Starleague winner, youngest Golden Mouse winner, highest KeSPA rank of all time, and the highest overall Elo, TvP, TvZ and TvT ranks of all time. He has been in three consecutive dual Starleague finals, winning four golds within the past year. He defeated Kal (Goojila) in the 2010 World Cyber Games, eventually becoming the world champion. He also came back in 2017 and won the ASL season 2, defeating sea in a series of 3–1. He had to beat Jaedong in the semi-finals and it went to the 5th game, which he eventually won 3–2.\nZerg.\nHong Jin-ho (YellOw).\nHong Jin Ho known as \"Storm Zerg\" was an early rival to Lim Yo-Hwan (Boxer), losing several Starleague finals to him. Hong is known for his aggressive and harassing style of play, and for his rivalry with BoxeR. Hong never won first place in major StarCraft tournaments despite his strong performance. Hong managed to finish second place six times in the events, never once attaining a major championship, which earned him the title \"King of Silver.\" While there are some tournaments in which he finished first, these records was invalidated when the KeSPA announced to accept only OSL and MSL records. His notable victories include first place in the 2003 ITV 5th Starleague, the Snickers All-Star league in 2005 and the first BlizzCon invitational tournament.\nHong suffered his last major defeat against Han \"Casy\" Dong-wook in the semi-finals of the Shinhan Bank Season 1 OSL in 2006, and claimed 3rd place. Due to poor performance in the following OSL, Hong had fallen into a slump from which he has not recovered. Hong reached the round of 32 in the GOMTV Averatech Classic, but was eliminated by oDin (Joo Young-Dal). He is now in the Korean Air Force since November 2008, and has enlisted in the StarCraft team Air Force ACE. After being a member of KAF ACE, Hong is recovering his form. The trigger was an old-fashioned 'storm-like' victory against Bisu[Shield] on 20 June 2009 in Shinhan Bank ProLeague 08–09, after 735 days of silence. He could not qualify for either OSL nor MSL since Shinhan Bank OSL season 2 in 2006, but in the end of Shinhan Bank ProLeague 09–10 season, Hong ended the season securing a 3-game winning streak, including a dramatic victory against Jaedong.\nHong announced his retirement from professional gaming on his website on 16 June 2011. At his retirement ceremony, BoxeR jokingly handed him an empty StarCraft 2 box. BoxeR said that the box was empty, but the account was at the Slayers clan house and if Hong ever considered transitioning into StarCraft 2, he knew where to go. As of August 2011 he is appearing in a reality series entitled \"Project A\" on GOMtv. The series follows Hong as he attempts to qualify for the GOMTV Global StarCraft II League and relaunch his progaming career in StarCraft 2. The series premiered on 12 August 2011\nMa Jae-Yoon (sAviOr[gm]).\nsAviOr (previously known as IPXZerg) has won three MSLs and one OSL, and reached five consecutive MSL finals during the height of his dominance. Nicknamed \"Maestro\" for his play, timing, and game sense, he is viewed as a strong Zerg, having defeated BoxeR, iloveoov, NaDa, Midas, Nal_rA and many other top players. He is well known for his perfect defiler usage, particularly in the ZvT matchup. sAviOr made the semifinals of the 2007 September–November GOM TV MSL but was surprisingly eliminated by Terran player Mind 2–3. Soon after, he was eliminated 1–2 by Bisu in the 2007 Ever OSL quarterfinals. sAviOr is currently in a competitive slump, having been eliminated from the first round of both the most recent OSL and MSL. However, he has since qualified for the next upcoming MSL and is currently ranked 53rd in the February 2010 KeSPA ranking. On 13 April 2010, he was implicated in a cheating scandal involving several Korean pro gamers, illegal betting websites, and allegations of games being deliberately lost. As the investigation continued, Savior admitted his guilt on 20 May, and was forced into retirement by KeSPA.\nLee Jae-Dong (n.Die_Jaedong).\nKnown as the \"Lord of Destruction\", and the \"Tyrant\", Jaedong was Team 8's ace player. He took down many top players when he first entered the scene, earning the nickname \"Legend Killer\". He is known for his intense and focused demeanor during play and his tendency to excel under pressure. He is known for his micro of mutalisks, his trademark unit. His ZvT and ZvZ are among the best in the progaming scene, and he is regarded as the best Zerg player, if not the best player overall. He walked the Royal Road by qualifying for the OSL for the first time and defeating Stork in the EVER OSL finals 3–1. Soon thereafter, he proved that his ZvP matchup was strong by defeating Bisu in the GOMTV MSL S4 group stages. Since his OSL win, Jaedong's ZvP has statistically been his second strongest matchup (71.25%) Jaedong has also won the MSL season 4 by defeating Siz) Kal 3–1 in March 2008, further proving himself as the top Zerg on the scene. Jaedong set a new record for the highest ZvZ streak by winning 12 games straight, only losing to Oversky in the Proleague.\nAs of June 2009, he is 72–19 (79.12%) in ZvZ, and considering that ZvZ is thought to be one of the most volatile and luck based matchups, this is a feat. In July 2008, he was defeated in the Arena MSL 2008 Finals 0–3 by his teammate Park Ji-Su (ForGG), but he was able to defeat his rival Flash 3–0 in the TG Sambo Intel Classic finals. He has won his second OSL title against Fantasy in the Batoo OSL 2009. In the Summer 2009 StarCraft season, he was the only player to make the quarterfinals of every Starleague: GOMTV Avertec Classic, OSL, and MSL. He also carried his team through the Shinhan Bank 08-09 Proleague and brought them a second-place finish. On 22 August 2009 he won the Bacchus OSL (his third OSL title) and won the Golden Mouse. Jaedong was ranked first in the February 2010 KeSPA rankings. Jaedong has also been a very popular person outside of StarCraft having done commercials for various Korean companies and attending several international competitions such as the World Cyber Games two years in a row (2008–2009) and is the WCG champion for 2009, after beating his fellow Korean, Stork in the finals. In 2012, Jaedong left Team 8 and joined North American based organisation Evil Geniuses on a one-year contract, in order to compete in the first SC2 Proleague season.\nPark Sung-Joon (JulyZerg).\nJulyZerg (or simply \"July\"), the \"God of War\", was credited with revitalizing what had been stagnant Zerg play, and of leading the way for a kind of \"Zerg renaissance\" with his highly dynamic and aggressive style, incorporating a strong understanding of his opponent's weaknesses and immaculate unit control. He is the first Zerg player to win an OSL; having accomplished this feat in 2004, and he also won the second KT-KTF Premiere League. In July 2005 he won a second OSL, something that to that date only four other players have accomplished, and after a long slump managed to win the Ever OSL 2008, making him the second player and first zerg to win three OSL titles and claiming the Golden Mouse trophy. July is known for being closer to the amateur community than the typical professional player, having played in amateur leagues such as the WGTour Speed Ladder in the past, and was one of the players on the Asian team for the friendly Blizzard Invitational Tournament held in early 2005. JulyZerg is currently playing StarCraft II on the pro team ST, but is serving in the military until 2014.\nProtoss.\nPark Jung Suk ([Oops]Reach).\nReach, nicknamed \"MAN-TOSS\" (due to his muscular build and brute strategies) or \"Hero Protoss\", is the Protoss player who has been most consistent in the long term, beating Boxer in an OSL final near the height of his dominance, and placing well in tournaments. He is known for his standard/solid/safe style of play, with flawless macro and use of Psi Storm (the latter of which earned him the other nickname \"Mudang Protoss\", meaning shaman Protoss in Korean, owing to the uncanny accuracy of his Psionic Storm use), although he has been leaning away from this slightly due to changes in the playing style of the other races. Reach is known for his PvP and PvT skills, with his PvZ being strong. Park was the captain of the KTF progaming team. Reach has been absent from the Starleagues and KeSPA rankings for 18 months but has recently returned to StarCraft pro-gaming tournaments, qualifying for the 2007 Season 1 OSL. Reach has slumped since his return and is currently enlisted with Yellow in Air Force ACE. Reach has shown some return to form with impressive victories in the ProLeague. Since his retirement from professional Brood War he became coach of the Najin Corporation \"League of Legends\" teams.\nKang Min (Nal_rA).\nThe 'Dreaming Protoss' is often considered to be a Protoss version of Boxer due to his creative and daring play. He frequently hides his buildings in other parts of the map and pioneered and standardized several notable Protoss strategies such as fast expanding and using corsairs and reavers in tandem against Zerg. He won an OSL and MSL in the same season and does well in team tournaments, playing for KTF. He has won the Blizzard WorldWide Invitational tournament during early 2006. He has recently recovered from a severe slump; and qualified for ShinHan Bank 2 OSL and made it to the Pringles MSL finals by defeating Kingdom, but lost 3–1 to sAviOr. He also made it to the Semi-Finals of the subsequent Pringles 2 MSL, only to lose again at the hands of sAviOr. Nal_rA has retired from progaming and is a broadcaster for OnGameNet. In 2009, it was announced that Nal_rA would retire from commentating and that he would pursue a career in teaching at Seoul Institute of the Arts.\nKim Taek-Yong (Bisu[Shield]).\nBisu (meaning \"assassin's dagger\" in Korean), nicknamed \"Ninja Toss\" for his creative \"Dark Templar\" use, plays at the highest level of progaming. He had moderate success in Shinhan OSL 2 where he made it to the Sweet 16 playoff round. Bisu rose to prominence when he unexpectedly defeated sAviOr 3–0 in the March 2007 GOM MSL final at the height of Savior's dominance. Bisu is also known as the \"Revolutionist\" for his strong PvZ, and changing how Protoss players play the matchup. He also recently won the July 2007 GOM MSL 2 by defeating Stork 3–2. Bisu is the first Protoss player to reach the top spot in KeSPA history. Bisu lost 1–3 to Mind in the finals of the September GOM MSL 3 and was eliminated by Stork in the semifinals of the EVER OSL. Bisu was eliminated in the group stages of GOM MSL 4, losing most notably to Jaedong. However, he made it to the semifinals of the Bacchus OSL, but was eliminated by Flash.\nBisu regained his dominant form by defeating free in ClubDay MSL semifinal, and defeated Jangbi in final to win his 3rd MSL title, the first and only Protoss to achieve this feat. For the first time in StarCraft progaming history, two opponents faced in a final back to back, once again, Bisu defeated Jangbi 3–1 in the GOM Averatec-Intel Classic Season 2 tournament. Inexplicably, his performance in OSL did not yield him any championships which is the only knock on his career so far. Bisu is known for his plays against zerg having popularized the forge fast expand and the Bisu build. He is currently ranked 2nd in the August 2009 Kespa rankings and is considered to be the best protoss in history. His team SKT1 also won their second proleague grand finals with Bisu being the ace player of their team having won the most matches for them and having the best win–loss ratio in the entire tournament. Unfortunately, he has been slumping for a long time and has one of the lowest Elo ratings among the top players of each race.\nSong Byung-Gu (Stork[gm]).\nStork, nicknamed 'The Faultless Supreme Commander' for his all-round ability against all (vs protoss 60.8%, vs zerg 53.9%, vs terran 66%), is one of the highest pro-gamers, 'Taek-Bang-LeeSSang'. His debut was 2004, and now he is the oldest programer in active. He was focused when he won CYON 2004 challenge league, and got 4th rank of EVER starleague 2005. However he couldn't get contentable grade. After his frustration, he didn't give up, and finally he made victory of Samsung KHAN in 2007, 2008. At that time, he became the finalist of EVER starleague 2007 and 2007 Bacchus starleague, but he was lost by Flash, and Jaedong. His career was wonderful, but only second place, and it made him called as 'Kong-Line (successor of Yellow, Hong Jin-Ho)'. However, finally he got the win at Incruit starleague and he was the legend of fall (This is the Legend of protoss who won the Starleague at fall. First is Park Jung-suk (DAUM OSL 2002), and continued by Oh Yeong-jong (So1 OSL 2005), Song Byung-Gu (Incruit OSL 2008), and Hu Young-Moo (Jin-air OSL 2011). In 2008, he also won the WCG2007 Grand-Final, against Sha Junchun, China).\nIn 2009, he became the finalist of many contests such as WCG, IEF. And because of this career, he got the other nickname, 'Song Sun-sin (compound of Song(Last name) and Lee Sun-sin (the greatest general of Japanese invasion of Korea in 1592).

        "text": "The 2007 SummerSlam was the 20th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on August 26, 2007, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Tickets for SummerSlam went on sale on December 30, 2006, and sold out in 40 minutes.\nThe main feud, a staged rivalry between wrestlers, heading into the event from the Raw brand was between John Cena and Randy Orton. On the July 23 episode of \"Raw\", Jonathan Coachman announced Orton as the number one contender to the WWE Championship. Over the proceeding weeks, Orton provoked Cena by interfering and attacking him during his matches. From SmackDown!, the predominant feud was between The Great Khali and Batista. After Khali defeated Batista and Kane in a Triple Threat match, Theodore Long booked Khali to defend the World Heavyweight Championship against Batista at SummerSlam. The primary feud from ECW was between John Morrison and CM Punk. By defeating Morrison in a 15 Minutes of Fame match, Punk became the number one contender to the ECW Championship at SummerSlam.\nSeveral of the existing feuds carried on after the event. Notably, CM Punk continued to face John Morrison, defeating him for the ECW Championship the following month on \"ECW on Sci Fi\". The day after SummerSlam, Orton, as part of the scripted events, interfered in a match between Cena and King Booker and intensified the feud by attacking Cena's father. Khali and Batista faced each other at Unforgiven, the following pay-per-view, as part of a triple threat match; Batista was victorious in this match and won the World Heavyweight Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2007 event was the 20th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 26, 2007, at the Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions.\nWWE had originally planned a storyline between the cast of the \"Jackass\" television series and Umaga, with the conclusion in a match at SummerSlam. It was scheduled to begin at the previous pay-per-view event, The Great American Bash, but was canceled after the \"Jackass\" cast dropped out due to the negative media attention surrounding the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide. However, 14 years later, the \"Jackass\" cast and Johnny Knoxville himself would later have a match at WrestleMania 38 against Sami Zayn.\nStorylines.\nThe main staged rivalry heading into SummerSlam on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Randy Orton over the WWE Championship. At The Great American Bash, Cena defeated Bobby Lashley to retain the WWE Championship. The next night on \"Raw\", after a Handicap match involving Cena, Orton came out and executed an RKO on Cena. Shortly thereafter, Executive Assistant Jonathan Coachman announced Orton as the new number-one contender to the WWE Championship. Before that, Orton claimed that he had never faced Cena in a one-on-one WWE Championship match. On the July 30 episode of \"Raw\", Carlito defeated Cena in a non-title match after Orton interfered and distracted Cena. Three weeks later, on the August 18 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXV\", Cena faced off against Carlito in another non-title match, which Cena won. After the match, Orton came out and attacked Cena, which led to a RKO from Orton through a steel chair.\nThe main storyline on the SmackDown! brand was between The Great Khali and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the July 6 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Khali issued an open challenge for a match at The Great American Bash, which was accepted by Batista later that night. On \"SmackDown!\" the following week, the match between Khali and Batista was made official after a contract signing. That same night, then-World Heavyweight Champion Edge, who was scheduled to face Kane for the title at The Great American Bash, suffered a legitimate injury—a left pectoral muscle tear—after Kane interrupted his Mardi Gras style celebration.&lt;ref name=\"sd-7/20\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the July 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Edge was forced to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship due to the severity of his injury. He later commented-\nSmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long then announced that there would be a 20-man Battle Royal later that night to determine a new World Heavyweight Champion. Khali won the Battle Royal and became the new World Heavyweight Champion by last eliminating Kane and Batista. Khali defeated the two and retained the title at The Great American Bash. Five days later on \"SmackDown!\", Batista interrupted Khali's celebration and challenged him to a match at SummerSlam. The next week, on the August 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Long announced that Khali would defend his title against Batista at SummerSlam.\nAnother main rivalry on the Raw brand heading into SummerSlam was between the returning Triple H against King Booker. At New Year's Revolution, during a World Tag Team Championship match between Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) and D-Generation X (Shawn Michaels and Triple H), Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps during the match that left him out of action. On the July 16 episode of \"Raw\", Booker entered using Triple H's entrance music \"King of Kings\". Booker declared that neither Triple H nor Jerry Lawler could be known as \"The King\". On the August 6 episode of \"Raw\", Booker defeated Lawler in a match where the loser had to crown the winner the next week. When the time came, Lawler refused, declaring that Triple H was still a king and announcing that Booker would face Triple H at SummerSlam. Booker then attacked Lawler, throwing him into the ring post and hitting him with a television monitor.\nThe predominant staged rivalry from the ECW brand was between John Morrison and CM Punk over the ECW Championship. Morrison (then known as Johnny Nitro) won the vacant title at defeating Punk. At The Great American Bash, Morrison defeated Punk to retain the championship. On the July 31 episode of \"ECW\", Punk defeated Tommy Dreamer and Elijah Burke in a Triple threat match to earn a 15 Minutes of Fame match with Morrison. The following week on \"ECW\", Punk defeated Morrison by pinfall after executing a GTS (Go To Sleep). As a result of this victory, Punk earned himself a championship match against Morrison at SummerSlam.\nOne of the primary preliminary matches was a standard one-on-one match between Rey Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero. Their storyline first began in July 2006 at The Great American Bash. Guerrero interfered in Mysterio's World Heavyweight Championship match with King Booker by hitting Mysterio with a steel chair, costing him the championship. Guerrero defeated Mysterio the following month at SummerSlam 2006, winning the match after performing a frog splash At No Mercy, Mysterio defeated Guerrero in a Falls Count Anywhere match, pinning him after performing a crossbody off a guard rail. On the October 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Guerrero defeated Mysterio in an \"I Quit\" match by forcing him to quit after hitting his left knee repeatedly with a steel chair. During the match, Mysterio suffered a real injury—an ACL and patella tendon tear in his left knee. Ten months later, on the August 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", a match between Mysterio and Guerrero was booked for SummerSlam.\nEvent.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, World Tag Team Champions Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defeated Paul London and Brian Kendrick in a dark match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match that aired was between Kane and Finlay. Kane controlled the opening minutes of the match, performing a variety of moves including a scoop slam and a big boot. After some back and forth action, Finlay was able to hit Kane with a shillelagh in the ribs. Kane kicked out of the pin attempt and executed a chokeslam, pinning him afterwards for the win.\nNext was a triple threat match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship that involved Umaga, Carlito, and Mr. Kennedy. Kennedy attempted to form an alliance with Carlito in the beginning, but Umaga quickly turned the match in his favor. Kennedy and Carlito soon gained the upper hand after Carlito dropkicked Umaga to the outside. Shortly thereafter, Carlito turned on Kennedy and attempted to pin him with a roll-up. After a back and forth match between the three, Umaga regained control and performed a Samoan Spike on Kennedy, which led to Umaga pinning Kennedy for the win and successfully retaining the WWE Intercontinental Championship.\nThe third match was Rey Mysterio versus Chavo Guerrero, which was Mysterio's first match since Guerrero injured his knee in October 2006. Mysterio gained the early advantage when he was able to perform an arm drag and a plancha on Guerrero. Mysterio then performed a low dropkick to Guerrero's left knee, followed by a diving hurricanrana. Towards the end of the match, Guerrero was able to perform a Gory Bomb on Mysterio after Mysterio had missed a crossbody. Mysterio kicked out of the pin attempt and performed a 619 followed by a springboard splash for the pinfall victory.\nNext was an Interpromotional Divas Battle Royal involving Beth Phoenix, Melina, Mickie James, Jillian Hall, and Maria from Raw, Michelle McCool, Torrie Wilson, Kristal, and Victoria from SmackDown, and Kelly Kelly, Layla, and Brooke from ECW. Shortly after the match began, Phoenix threw Brooke over the top rope. Soon after, Hall eliminated Maria and Layla was thrown out by Melina. Kristal then eliminated Victoria, but was then thrown over the ropes by James and accidentally knocked off the apron by McCool. Shortly after, Phoenix and Hall eliminated Kelly, and Hall and James began pulling each other over the ropes. Wilson threw Hall out to the floor whilst Melina knocked James off the apron. McCool and Wilson then worked together to eliminate Melina. The two continued their alliance, but Phoenix was able to get the upper hand, first eliminating Wilson, followed by throwing McCool over the ropes to win the match and a future WWE Women's Championship match.\nShortly after the match ended, WWE United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) came to the ring and challenged Matt Hardy to a beer drinking contest. Hardy declined and named a replacement, Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin came out and mocked MVP by doing several warm-up exercises similar to those MVP does before a match. As the contest was set to start, Austin delivered a Stone Cold Stunner to MVP and left the ring.\nNext on the card was John Morrison versus CM Punk for the ECW Championship. Punk gained early control when he was able to perform a scoop slam as well as a springboard dropkick; however, Morrison was able to counter a shoulder block attempt into a neckbreaker on the ring apron. After Morrison controlled the match for several minutes, Punk was able to put the match back in his favor after performing a diving crossbody followed by an enzuigiri. Morrison, however, countered a Frankensteiner attempt into a pin-cover while using the ropes for leverage. He got the win, thus retaining the ECW Championship.\nMain event matches.\nThe sixth match of the event was between the returning Triple H and King Booker, who was accompanied by Queen Sharmell. Triple H gained the early advantage as the match began; however, Booker was able to gain control after performing a low dropkick. Triple H regained control after countering Booker and performing a variety of moves, which included a corner clothesline and a spinebuster. Booker put the match back in his favor after reversing a clothesline attempt into a Book End, which was followed by a sidewalk slam. After Booker missed a diving somersault leg drop, Triple H was able to recover and perform a Pedigree. Triple H pinned Booker afterwards to gain the victory.\nThe World Heavyweight Championship match between champion The Great Khali and challenger Batista was next. Khali controlled most of the match and performed a variety of moves, which included a brain chop, a big boot, and multiple clotheslines. Batista won the match after Khali intentionally disqualified himself by hitting him with a steel chair. Since a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, Khali retained the title. Following the match, Khali attempted to hit Batista with another chairshot only for Batista to duck it and spear Khali. Batista would then use the chair to his advantage and hit Khali with it multiple times.\nNext was the main event, which saw John Cena defend the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. After back and forth action in the opening minutes, Orton gained the advantage over Cena after Cena missed a flying shoulder block attempt. Orton followed up by applying a reverse chinlock and attacking Cena's leg. After Orton controlled the match for several minutes, Cena gained the advantage and performed various maneuvers, which included a twisting belly to belly side slam and the Five Knuckle Shuffle; Orton, however, was able to counter an FU attempt into an inverted headlock backbreaker. Cena countered a running punt attempt into the STFU submission hold. Orton, however, got to the bottom rope, and performed an RKO. Cena kicked out of the pin attempt and performed an FU for the pinfall victory, thus retaining the WWE Championship.\nReception.\nTickets for SummerSlam went on sale on December 30, 2006, and sold out in forty minutes. The event grossed over US$1 million in ticket sales from an attendance of 17,441 out of a 17,040 maximum capacity building. Due to the production of the event, however, the capacity of the arena was set at a lower standard, and as a result the arena reached its maximum capacity. This was confirmed by the ticket sales and by WWE's official website on August 28, 2007. According to a press release by WWE in late 2007, the event received 537,000 buys, which was higher than the previous year's SummerSlam buys of 529,000. The buys from SummerSlam helped the promotion's revenue, which was $18.8 million, a sum lower than the prior year of $19.7 million. Canadian Online Explorer and its professional wrestling section rated the entire event a 6.5 out of 10. The rating was higher than the previous year's SummerSlam rating, a 5.5 out of 10. The main event from the Raw brand was rated a 7.5 out of 10; while the main event from the SmackDown brand was rated a 1 out of 10.\nThe event was released on DVD on September 25, 2007. The DVD was distributed by the label, Genius Products. The DVD reached a peak position of first on \"Billboard\"'s Weekly Video Sales chart for the week of October 27, 2007. The DVD remained on the charts for twelve consecutive weeks; though, after the week of October 27, 2007, the DVD ranked lower. During its final week on the chart, January 18, 2008, it ranked 19th. The DVD also received reviews from customers, as the average customer rating from Amazon.com was a 3.5 out of 5. The average customer rating however, from CD Universe was a 5 out of 5 stars.\nAftermath.\nDuring the event, John Cena provoked his feud with Randy Orton. On the August 27 episode of \"Raw\", Cena faced King Booker in a non-title match. When Cena appeared close to winning, Orton interfered and attacked him, causing Cena to win by disqualification. After the match ended, Orton attacked Cena's father, who was sitting at ringside, and kicked him in the head. The two faced each other in a rematch at Unforgiven for the WWE Championship. Cena was disqualified in the match for continuously punching Orton. Orton won the match but not the title. Afterwards, Cena's father kicked Orton in the head, in the same way Orton had kicked him one-month prior.\nOn the August 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Rey Mysterio, Finlay, Kane, and Batista participated in a four-man Championship Competition tournament. Mysterio defeated Batista and Finlay and became the number-one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Unforgiven. On the September 7 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Mysterio defeated Chavo Guerrero in an \"I Quit\" match. After the match, The Great Khali attacked Mysterio until Batista came out and executed a spear on Khali. Batista was then included in the one-on-one title match at Unforgiven, making it a Triple Threat match. At Unforgiven, Batista won the championship for a third time.\nThe feud between Matt Hardy and Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) continued when they were forced to team up against Deuce 'n Domino on the August 31 episode of \"SmackDown!\". They won the match and the WWE Tag Team Championship. The following month at Unforgiven, MVP and Hardy defeated Deuce 'n Domino to retain the WWE Tag Team Championship. In October, at No Mercy, Hardy defeated MVP in a pizza-eating contest. On the November 16 episode of \"SmackDown!\", MVP and Hardy lost the WWE Tag Team Championship to the team of John Morrison and The Miz.\nUmaga lost the WWE Intercontinental Championship to Jeff Hardy on the September 3 episode of \"Raw\". Afterwards, Umaga started a feud with Triple H and faced off against him in a Street Fight two months later at Cyber Sunday. At Unforgiven, Candice Michelle defeated Beth Phoenix to retain the WWE Women's Championship. Phoenix, however, later defeated Candice at No Mercy to win the title. On the September 4 episode of \"ECW on Sci Fi\", CM Punk defeated John Morrison to win the ECW Championship. At Cyber Sunday, Punk retained the title by defeating The Miz. The following month, at Survivor Series, Punk defeated Morrison and The Miz in a Triple Threat match to retain the ECW Championship.\nThis was the last SummerSlam ever to be in 4:3 format, as in January 2008, all WWE shows went into high definition.\nThis was also the last SummerSlam where no championships changed hands until 2022."

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. The event took place on August 20, 2006, at the TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. This marked the first inter-brand pay-per-view to include the ECW brand.\nThe main match on the Raw brand featured Edge against John Cena for the WWE Championship, which Edge won by pinfall after hitting Cena in the back of the head with a pair of brass knuckles. The main match on the SmackDown! brand pitted King Booker against Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Batista won by disqualification following interference from Queen Sharmell. The primary match on the ECW brand pitted The Big Show against Sabu in an Extreme rules match for the ECW World Championship. Big Show won the match and retained the title after pinning Sabu following a chokeslam through a table. The undercard included D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) against Vince and Shane McMahon as well as Hulk Hogan against Randy Orton, which was Hogan's last match in WWE.\nSeveral of the existing feuds carried on after the event. D-Generation X continued feuding with The McMahons, defeating them and The Big Show in a Hell in a Cell match the following month. The feud between Batista and King Booker also continued, with the two facing off as part of a fatal four-way match at No Mercy, which Booker won. The following month, at Unforgiven, John Cena defeated Edge in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match to win the WWE Championship and conclude their storyline.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2006 event was the 19th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 20, 2006, at the TD Banknorth Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown!, and ECW brand divisions. It was the first SummerSlam to include ECW, a relaunch of the former Extreme Championship Wrestling promotion that became WWE's third brand in May, subsequently also being the first SummerSlam to feature the ECW World Championship. This also marked the first inter-brand pay-per-view to include ECW.\nStorylines.\nThe main feud heading into SummerSlam on Raw was between WWE Champion Edge and John Cena. Edge won the title on the July 3 episode of \"Raw\", defeating then-champion Rob Van Dam and Cena in a triple threat match.&lt;ref name=\"7/03 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The following week on \"Raw\", after defeating Shelton Benjamin, Cena attacked Edge, who was providing commentary for the match. Edge, however, fought off Cena and executed an Edgecution followed by a spear.&lt;ref name=\"7/10 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that night, as part of the storyline, Cena attacked Edge and Lita, Edge's girlfriend, at their hotel. On the July 15 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII\", Cena faced off against Edge for the WWE Championship. Cena won the match by disqualification after Lita interfered and slapped the referee.&lt;ref name=\"7/15 SNME\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Since a championship cannot change hands via countout or disqualification, Edge retained the title. After the match, Cena attacked Edge and performed an FU through a broadcast table. Three weeks later, on the July 31 edition of \"Raw\", a match between Edge and Cena for the WWE Championship was booked for SummerSlam, with the stipulation that if Edge got himself counted out or intentionally disqualified, he would lose the WWE Championship.&lt;ref name=\"7/31 Raw\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On August 14, Edge went to Cena's father's house in West Newbury, Massachusetts, and slapped him.\nThe secondary feud on the Raw brand was between D-Generation X (DX) (Triple H and Shawn Michaels) and The McMahons (Vince McMahon and Shane McMahon). In December, Michaels interrupted Vince and told him that he should move on from the Montreal Incident. Vince responded by saying that he could screw Michaels like he did Bret Hart anytime he wanted. This led to a feud between Michaels and The McMahons which culminated in a No Holds Barred match at WrestleMania 22 between Michaels and Vince. Michaels won the match despite interference from The Spirit Squad and Shane. Vince claimed that Michaels' victory was a result of \"divine intervention\" and booked himself in a tag team match with Shane against Michaels and God at Backlash. The McMahons would win the match after interference from The Spirit Squad. Two weeks later, Michaels faced the Spirit Squad in a five on one handicap match and suffered a knee injury when the Spirit Squad crushed his knee with a steel chair. Triple H, who Vince recruited, was ordered to crush Michaels' skull with a sledgehammer. When Kenny, the leader of the Spirit Squad, took the sledgehammer away from Triple H and attempted to hit Michaels with it, Triple H stepped in front of Kenny who charged at Michaels but Triple H hit him with a spinebuster and attacked the Spirit Squad turning face for the first time since 2002. This led to Michaels and Triple H reforming DX for the first time since their teased reunion in 2002. DX defeated the Spirit Squad at Vengeance in a five on two handicap match. The next night on \"Raw\", DX mocked the McMahons in one of their famous parodies and when The McMahons and the Spirit Squad came out to confront them they were covered with Manure. Three weeks later, Vince set up a tag team match between himself and Shane against DX at SummerSlam.\nThe main feud on the SmackDown! brand was between King Booker and Batista over the World Heavyweight Championship. In January, Batista legitimately tore his triceps and was forced to vacate the World Heavyweight Championship. At No Way Out the following month, Batista cut a promo claiming that when he returned from injury, he would become World Heavyweight Champion once again. Batista made his in-ring return five months later, on the edition of July 15 of \"Saturday Night's Main Event XXXIII\", in a six-man tag team match. At The Great American Bash, Booker defeated Rey Mysterio to win the World Heavyweight Championship, and Mr. Kennedy defeated Batista by disqualification. On the August 4 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Batista defeated Kennedy and declined any congratulations until after he won back the World Heavyweight Championship. The following week, on \"SmackDown!\", Batista thanked Booker for holding onto \"his\" title and told him he would be needing it back at SummerSlam.\nThe main feud on ECW was between ECW World Champion Big Show and Sabu. On the July 25 episode of \"ECW\", Sabu requested a title match against Big Show, but ECW Representative Paul Heyman denied his request. Later that night, after Big Show defeated Kane to retain the title, Sabu attacked Big Show with a steel chair. The next week, Heyman once again denied Sabu's request for the title match.\nIn retaliation, Sabu attacked Big Show with a steel chair and executed an Arabian Facebuster, a diving leg drop with a chair. On the August 15 episode of \"ECW\", Sabu faced Rob Van Dam in a ladder match, where whoever won would be face Big Show for the ECW World Championship. Sabu won the match, and Big Show came out and executed a chokeslam on both Sabu and Van Dam.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nBefore the event went live on pay-per-view, Carlito defeated Rob Conway in a dark match following a Backcracker. The first match was Chavo Guerrero versus Rey Mysterio. Both men took control during the match. Vickie Guerrero interrupted the match and tried to stop both men from fighting. She pulled Chavo out of the ring and tried to stop him, but he kept on fighting. Vickie then tried to plead with Mysterio but accidentally shoved him off the ropes. Chavo took advantage by performing a frog splash on Mysterio for the victory.\nThe second match was an Extreme Rules match for the ECW World Championship between champion The Big Show and Sabu. In the beginning, Sabu gained the advantage in the match as he threw chairs into Big Show's head and leapt off a chair to put Big Show head first through a table. As a result, Big Show began to bleed. After some back and forth action, Sabu took the upper hand as he performed a spike DDT on Big Show through a table. Big Show chokeslammed Sabu through a table for the victory.\nThe third match was between Hulk Hogan and Randy Orton. Orton took the advantage in the match, as he focused on Hogan's injured knee. The match saw Orton perform an RKO on Hogan. As Orton went for the pin, Hogan had his feet on the ropes. The referee did not see his feet and originally gave Orton the victory. Later, the referee saw that Hogan's feet were still on the ropes and restarted the match. Hogan won the match when he performed a leg drop on Orton for a pinfall victory. To date, this is Hogan's last match in the WWE.\nThe fourth match was an \"I Quit\" match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley. In the beginning, Foley stuffed his smelly gym sock, Mr. Socko, down Flair's gullet to apply the Mandible claw. Flair nearly passed out from the sock’s foul smell, but since the match was an “I Quit” match, Foley was unable to capitalize. The ring was surrounded by many hardcore objects, including Foley's signature bag of thumbtacks. Flair was thrown into these objects several times. He managed to hit Foley with a baseball bat wrapped in barbed wire. When Foley got up, Flair charged him over the top rope onto a trashcan. Foley was unconscious until Melina, Foley's friend, came with officials to check him. Foley was unable to continue, so the referee rang the bell, giving Flair the victory. Flair said that the match cannot end until Foley quits, and continued the assault. Melina came down to save Foley, and eventually threw in the towel on Foley's behalf. Flair insisted on continuing the match until Foley quit. Flair continued to assault Foley with the barbed wire bat. Melina laid in between Flair and Foley, and as Flair was ready to hit Melina with the bat, Foley quit the match and gave Flair the victory to protect Melina.\nMain event Matches.\nThe fifth match was for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and the champion King Booker. During the match, Booker set Batista up for the scissors kick, but as he performed the move, Batista countered it into a suplex powerslam. Batista tried a Batista Bomb, but Queen Sharmell interfered by attacking Batista as he tried to lift Booker. As a result, Booker was disqualified, so Batista won the match but not the title because a title cannot change hands by disqualification.\nThe sixth match was a tag team match between D-Generation X (DX) (Shawn Michaels and Triple H) and The McMahons (Vince and Shane). Before the beginning of the match, the Spirit Squad interfered on the behalf of the McMahons but were tossed out by DX until Finlay, William Regal, Mr. Kennedy, and The Big Show interfered. Triple H controlled the first three, while Michaels fought Big Show, who chokeslammed Triple H through a broadcast table. The match officially began as the McMahons took advantage and performed several tag team moves on DX, including the Hart Attack and the Doomsday Device. Shane tried to pin Michaels, but Michaels kicked out of the move and got up. He clotheslined Shane and tagged in Triple H. The McMahons were knocked to the floor, but Umaga interfered as the final man on the behalf of the McMahons. Armando Alejandro Estrada distracted the referee while Umaga delivered the Samoan Spike to Triple H. He also tried a Samoan Spike on Michaels, but Kane came to prevent Umaga from attacking DX by chasing him away. Vince tried to take advantage of Umaga's attack by pinning Triple H, but Triple H kicked out of the cover. Vince attacked the referee and then put a trash can on the face of Triple H, who was lying in the corner. Shane tried a Coast-To-Coast on Triple H, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on Shane. Vince tried to rescue his son, but a trash can was smashed on his head by Triple H. Michaels superkicked Vince, who went straight into Triple H's Pedigree for DX's pinfall victory.\nThe main event was between Edge and John Cena for the WWE Championship. In this match, the stipulation was that if Edge got disqualified, he would lose the title to Cena. During the match, Cena used several blows and slams on Edge. He also performed a belly-to-belly suplex on Edge and kept an eye on Edge's valet, the WWE Women's Champion Lita. Edge took advantage and connected with chokeholds and a flying clothesline, but Cena was able to recover. Lita tried to interfere, but Edge warned her not to get him disqualified. Lita threw a steel chair into the ring, but Edge threw it back outside the ring, and Cena took advantage. Cena then applied the STFU on Edge. Lita tried to interfere again, but Edge warned her once again. Edge made it to the ropes, and while the referee told Cena to break the hold, Lita handed Edge a pair of brass knuckles. As Cena broke the hold, Cena put Edge on his shoulders again for the FU, but this time Lita jumped on Edge's back when Cena had Edge set up for the FU, and Lita was the recipient of the FU instead of Edge. Edge then jumped off of Cena's back and hit Cena in the back of the head with the brass knuckles to win the match and retain his championship.\nAftermath.\nEdge and John Cena continued to feud over the WWE Championship. On the August 21 episode of \"Raw\", Lita threw John Cena's \"Spinner WWE Championship\" belt into the Long Island Sound and Edge unveiled his own \"Rated R-Spinner WWE Championship\" belt. Jeff Hardy returned to WWE on the Raw brand and defeated Edge in a non-title match by disqualification. After the match, Cena attacked Edge, and threw Edge into the Long Island Sound. On the August 28 episode of \"Raw\", Cena challenged Edge for the WWE Championship with the stipulation being that if Cena lost, he would not challenge for the title again and would leave Raw to go back to SmackDown!. Edge accepted the challenge, stating that the match would take place in his hometown and it would be a match that Edge had never lost: a Tables, Ladders and Chairs match. Later that night, Cena faced the returning Chris Masters in a match; Masters was disqualified when Edge attacked Cena. At Unforgiven, Cena defeated Edge, winning his third WWE Championship. Cena went on to hold the title for over a year.\nKing Booker and Batista also continued to feud over the World Heavyweight Championship. On the August 25 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Batista and Bobby Lashley defeated King Booker, Finlay and William Regal in a 3-on-2 handicap match. On the September 8 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Batista faced Booker in a SummerSlam rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship, which he lost due to interference by Finlay. The next week, Lashley became the number one contender to the World Heavyweight Championship by defeating Finlay, as Batista was scheduled to face Finlay. On the October 6 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Batista and Lashley faced off against each other, but the match ended in a no contest after Finlay and King Booker interfered. SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long then scheduled a Fatal Four-Way match for the World Heavyweight Championship at No Mercy. At No Mercy, Booker retained the World Heavyweight Championship.\nThe feud between DX and the McMahons continued the following night with DX vandalizing Vince McMahon's $30 million private jet, the world headquarters to the WWE, and even ripped the rear axle off of Vince McMahon's private limo with the use of a chain with all 3 being spray painted with the words DX. The next week on \"Raw\", DX took on Mr. Kennedy, William Regal, and Finlay in a 2 on 3 handicap match, after the match, Big Show, Shane and Vince McMahon came out and attacked DX, this led to a 2 on 3 handicap Hell in a Cell match at Unforgiven.\nChavo Guerrero and Rey Mysterio continued to feud. On the August 25 edition of \"SmackDown!\", Vickie Guerrero apologized to Mysterio and Chavo Guerrero for getting involved in their match; however, Vickie later turned villainous by attacking Mysterio with a steel chair and aligning with her nephew, Chavo, becoming his new business manager."

        "text": "The 2008 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament played on grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London in the United Kingdom. It was the 122nd edition of the Wimbledon Championships and were held from 23 June to 6 July 2008. It was the third Grand Slam tennis event of the year.\nSpanish player Rafael Nadal won the first Wimbledon title of his career; the first Grand Slam tournament he had won other than the French Open. Nadal defeated five-time defending champion Roger Federer in the final in what many regard as the greatest tennis match of all time. In the women's singles, Venus Williams claimed her fifth title, and first win over her sister Serena in a Wimbledon final (she had lost the previous two). The performances of Britons Andy Murray in the men's singles and Laura Robson in the girls' singles were able to arouse significant interest from the home crowd.\nFollowing the completion of the 2007 Championships, the new fixed roof was put in place at Centre Court, in time for the 2008 Championships. The retractable section of the new roof was completed for the 2009 Championships.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow are the tables with the point distribution for each discipline of the tournament.\nPrize distribution.\nThe total prize money for 2008 championships was £11,812,000.

Stéphane Houdet / Nicolas Peifer, 6–7(8–10), 6–1, 6–3\nNotable stories.\nBetting scandal.\nThere were allegations in a dossier that several matches, including eight at Wimbledon, were under suspicion of being fixed by professional gambling syndicates after bookmakers noted unexpected spikes in betting patterns. The dossier, released on the Sunday prior to the first day of play, had been commissioned by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), Women's Tennis Association (WTA), International Tennis Federation (ITF), and four Grand Slams earlier in the year, and was compiled by bookmakers. An official said, \"If you look at a tournament, you might see one match for £23,000 [in betting turnover], one for £27,000, one for £36,000 and one for £4.5m. It doesn’t take a genius to work out that something is going on in the last one.\" Betting on Wimbledon matches was popular in 2007, with over £420m wagered on bets.\nTo help deal with any potential gambling problems, the All England Club restricted access to player's changing rooms this year, allowing only the player and their coach permission. It was hoped that this would make communication between gamblers and players more difficult. Match fixing became a prominent issue in the media after the 2007 Orange Prokom Open, where the then World No. 4 Nikolay Davydenko came under suspicion of colluding with gamblers, and gambling company Betfair took the unprecedented step of voiding all bets on a match of his with Martín Vassallo Argüello.\nPigeon killing controversy.\nThe All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the sport club that plays host to the Championships, came under fire from animal activists for using marksmen to shoot down dive-bombing pigeons. The marksmen were ordered to use hawks to scare them away, but when some failed to do so, the marksmen killed them, which led to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) group releasing a statement admonishing the practice and subsequently, referring to the Animal Welfare Act 2006, contacting the Metropolitan Police.\nSeveral players complained about the pigeons distracting them during play, and because of the inefficient nature of the hawks, rapid action was sought on the Sunday evening before the tournament began. The marksmen were hired by the All England Club and, armed with rifles, shot several birds. When the media broke the story on Monday, a spokesman for the All England Club defended the club's approach, saying that, \"The hawks are our first line of deterrent, and by and large they do the job. But unfortunately there were one or two areas where the hawks didn't deter the pigeons, so it was deemed necessary to take a harder approach.\" By Tuesday however, the Metropolitan Police wildlife crime unit had been alerted to the practice by PETA, after allegedly infringing the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Bruce Friedrich, vice-president of PETA, wrote in a letter to the All England Club chairman Tim Phillips, that the birds did not represent \"a demonstrable risk to public health and safety\", and the activity was therefore in violation of the Act. A Wimbledon spokesperson subsequently announced that they had reneged on their policy, and that the All England Club would no longer shoot pigeons.\nA similar, but more inconspicuous, incident also occurred on the Sunday evening before the Championships. A swarm of bees descended upon the area surrounding the All England Club; this caused the clearing out of the players' lawn (where competitors gather after play) and a temporary cessation of some interviews. Further disruption was caused because organizers had to alter the overnight queuing system, in order to protect people. This was the first time that bees had caused disruptions at the All England Club. Some media outlets reported that the bees deserted the grounds after around 90 minutes, whilst others claimed that a similar resolution to the pigeon problem was sought, with the bees being professionally exterminated.\nBritish performance.\nThe British public were treated to some palpable success, as London-based Laura Robson became the first British girl to win the Girls' juniors competition since Annabel Croft in 1984. Fourteen-year-old Robson, the youngest player in the Girls' juniors, had to beat players aged up to eighteen, the maximum age allowed for entry into the juniors. She garnered considerable media attention; with a large crowd gathered to watch both her semi-final and final matches, the latter of which was on No. 1 Court, she called it an \"overwhelming experience.\" British-based gambling company Ladbrokes slashed her odds of winning Wimbledon before 2020 from 50/1 to 20/1.\nIn the seniors, 2007 mixed doubles champion Jamie Murray could not replicate his triumph of the previous year with new partner Liezel Huber, after his 2007 partner Jelena Janković opted not to play in order to concentrate on the singles competition. Murray and Huber reached the semi-finals where they were knocked out by Bob Bryan and Samantha Stosur.\nIn the seniors singles competition, the most significant impact was made by Scottish player Andy Murray, when he became the first British player to reach the quarter-finals since Tim Henman in 2004. Murray, often castigated in the British media for his surly manner, won the crowd's affections with his five-set victory over Richard Gasquet (\"details of this match are given in the Day 7 summary\"). The Murray–Gasquet match was watched by over 10 million people in the UK, and it was watched by more than 50% of the potential viewing public in his native Scotland.\nChris Eaton from Surrey, the ATP No. 661, successfully began his campaign in qualifying, and then caused a major surprise by beating ATP No. 114 Boris Pašanski in the first round. Anne Keothavong was the first British woman to directly qualify to the main draw since 1998, however no British woman made it beyond the second round.\nA tournament of upsets and surprises.\nThe men's side of the draw was notable for the performances of Marat Safin and Rainer Schüttler, ranked 75th and 94th respectively on entering the tournament. Safin caused an upset in the second round when he defeated Australian Open champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets, on the way to his first ever Wimbledon semi-final, where he lost to Roger Federer. After more than five years without reaching the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament, and thirteen consecutive Grand Slam tournaments without advancing past the second round, Schüttler also reached his first Wimbledon semi-final, where he was defeated in straight sets by the eventual champion Rafael Nadal. Schüttler had earlier defeated Arnaud Clément (who had previously not advanced to the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament since reaching the final of the 2001 Australian Open) in an epic quarter-final that lasted two days.\nThe women's side of the draw saw some of the biggest upsets in the tournament's history, in which the top four seeds—Ana Ivanovic, Jelena Janković, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova—all failed to reach the quarter-finals. Maria Sharapova suffered her earliest exit at Wimbledon when she lost to Alla Kudryavtseva in the second round; this was also her earliest exit at a Grand Slam since the 2003 US Open. Recent French Open champion and newly crowned World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic was stunned in the third round by Chinese wild card entrant and World No. 133 Zheng Jie. This was the earliest exit by a top seed at Wimbledon since Martina Hingis lost in the first round in 2001, and Zheng Jie also became the lowest-ranked player ever to defeat a top seed at the tournament. Janković and Kuznetsova were both toppled in the fourth round by Tamarine Tanasugarn and Agnieszka Radwańska, respectively. This was the first time since seedings began at Wimbledon in 1927 (and the first time in the Open Era) that none of the top four seeds managed to advance past the fourth round. Zheng Jie became the second Chinese player (after Li Na in 2006) to reach the quarter-finals at Wimbledon, and the first wild card entry ever to reach the semi-finals (a feat later achieved by Sabine Lisicki in 2011), where she was defeated by eventual runner-up Serena Williams. Meanwhile, Tanasugarn reached her first Grand Slam quarter-final by virtue of her victory over Janković, losing to the eventual champion Venus Williams.\nSingles seeds.\nThe following are the seeded players and notable players who withdrew from the event.

        "title": "Bruce Matthews (American football)",
        "text": "Bruce Rankin Matthews (born August 8, 1961) is an American former professional football player who played as a guard, center, offensive tackle, and long snapper in the National Football League (NFL) for 19 seasons, from 1983 to 2001. He spent his entire career playing for the Houston / Tennessee Oilers / Titans franchise. Highly versatile, Matthews played every position on the offensive line throughout his NFL career, starting in 99 games as a left guard, 87 as a center, 67 as a right guard, 22 as a right tackle, 17 as a left tackle, and was the long snapper on field goals, PATs, and punts. Having never missed a game due to injury, Matthews' 293 NFL games started is the third most of all time, behind quarterbacks Brett Favre and Tom Brady.\nMatthews played college football for the University of Southern California, where he was recognized as a consensus All-American for the USC Trojans football team as a senior. Matthews was selected in the first round of the 1983 NFL draft by the Oilers and was a 14-time Pro Bowl selection, tied for the second-most in NFL history, and a nine-time first-team All-Pro. Matthews was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2007, and his number 74 jersey is retired by the Titans.\nAfter retiring as a player, Matthews served as an assistant coach for the Houston Texans and Titans. A member of the Matthews family of football players, he is the brother of linebacker Clay Matthews Jr.; father of center Kevin Matthews and tackle Jake Matthews; and uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III and linebacker Casey Matthews.\nEarly years.\nBruce Rankin Matthews was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Clay Matthews Sr. and Daisy Matthews. His father was a defensive lineman for the San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s. The Matthews family moved from a Chicago suburb to Arcadia, California, when Bruce was entering 10th grade. He played football at Arcadia High School in Arcadia, California and was an immediate football standout on the offensive and defensive line, along with doing well in high school wrestling. As a junior in 1977, Matthews was named to the All-California Interscholastic Federation third-team, and as a senior, he played in the Shrine All-Star Football Classic alongside John Elway. Arcadia High later retired Matthews’ No. 72 jersey.\nCollege career.\nMatthews attended the University of Southern California, where he played all offensive line positions at various times for the USC Trojans football team. As a senior in 1982, Matthews was shifted from weakside to strongside guard to replace departing Roy Foster as the principal blocker in the \"Student Body Right\" play. Matthews was named to the first-team All-Pacific-10 Conference team after his junior and senior seasons. As a senior, Matthews earned consensus All-America honors and won the Morris Trophy, which is awarded to the best lineman in the conference.\nProfessional career.\nMatthews is considered to be one of the most versatile offensive linemen to play in the NFL. He started in 99 games as a left guard, 67 as a right guard, 87 as a center, 22 as a right tackle, 17 as a left tackle, and was the snapper on field goals, PATs, and punts. Matthews was selected to 14 Pro Bowls, which at the time tied a league record set by Merlin Olsen. Matthews was also named a first-team All-Pro nine times and an All-American Football Conference selection 12 times. An extremely durable player, Matthews retired after the 2001 season having played more games (296) than any NFL player, excluding kickers and punters, and played in more seasons (19) than any offensive lineman. He never missed a game due to injury, and started 229 consecutive games. Matthews is the only player who played against the Baltimore Colts in their last game at Memorial Stadium in 1983 and against the Baltimore Ravens in their last game at Memorial Stadium in 1997.\n1983–86: Guard, center, and tackle.\nThe Houston Oilers drafted Matthews with the ninth overall pick in the first round of the 1983 NFL draft. During his first two seasons, Matthews blocked for future Hall of Fame running back Earl Campbell. As a rookie, Matthews played guard and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. Before his second season, Matthews was moved from right guard to center, snapping to rookie quarterback Warren Moon. However, Matthews played multiple positions that season due to injuries on the offensive line; at one point he played center, guard, and tackle in successive weeks. In 1985 and 1986, Matthews alternated between right and left tackle.\n1987–90: Right guard.\nMatthews sat out of the first eight games of the 1987 season due to a contract dispute. When he returned, Matthews was moved back to right guard. He remained at the right guard position in 1988, 1989, and 1990, being named to the Pro Bowl each season. Matthews also earned first-team All-Pro recognition each year from the Associated Press (AP), \"Pro Football Weekly\", and \"The Sporting News\". He thrived in the run and shoot offensive scheme adopted by the Oilers around this time, which required linemen to be exceptionally agile. The holes Matthews opened up helped running back Mike Rozier to consecutive Pro Bowls in 1987 and 1988.\n1991–94: Center.\nThe Oilers placed Matthews at center for the final game of the 1990 season in an effort to bolster the team's running game. Of the move, Matthews said, \"I'd like to stay at guard, but forces greater than myself make these adjustments.\" Behind blocking by Matthews and fellow future Hall of Fame guard Mike Munchak, Oilers quarterback Warren Moon led the league in passing yards in 1990 and 1991, and running back Lorenzo White was a 1992 Pro Bowl selection. Matthews remained the team's center through the 1994 season, being named to the Pro Bowl each year.\n1995–2001: Left guard.\nPrior to the 1995 season, Matthews signed a four-year, $10.3 million contract extension with the Oilers. That year, the Oilers signed free agent center Mark Stepnoski, and as a result, Matthews moved to left guard. He spent the majority of the rest of his career at the position, occasionally filling in for injured players along the offensive line. During this time, the Oilers left Houston for Tennessee after the 1996 season. Matthews' blocking helped running back Eddie George to four straight Pro Bowl seasons.\nIn 1999, at age 37, Matthews signed another four-year contract to remain with the Oilers. That season, the Oilers rebranded as the Tennessee Titans. The team won 13 games, plus three more in the playoffs before losing to the St. Louis Rams in Super Bowl XXXIV.\nMatthews retired from football prior to the 2002 season at the age of 40.\nCoaching.\nHouston Texans.\nOn February 27, 2009, Matthews returned to Houston where he was signed on as an offensive assistant with the Houston Texans after volunteer coaching at his children's high school, Elkins High School.\nTennessee Titans.\nOn February 9, 2011, Matthews was hired as offensive line coach by new Tennessee Titans head coach Mike Munchak. Both were Hall of Fame linemen for the Houston Oilers. Regarding his new job, Matthews stated, \"For me this is an opportunity of a lifetime. It is such a unique opportunity to work with Mike because I think he will do a great job. It is just one of those things I couldn't pass up.\"\nAfter the Titans finished the 2013 season with a 7–9 record, general manager Ruston Webster and president/CEO Tommy Smith met with Munchak and gave him the option to fire a large contingent of assistant coaches, which included Matthews, in exchange for an extension and a raise, or lose his job as head coach. Munchak was not willing to fire everyone they were ordering him to fire, so Munchak parted ways with the Titans, along with Matthews and the other assistant coaches they wanted him to fire.\nHonors and legacy.\nIn his first year of eligibility, Matthews was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of the class of 2007. He was inducted during the Enshrinement Ceremony on August 4, 2007, with the unveiling of his bust, sculpted by Scott Myers. Matthews was the first player from the Tennessee Titans to be given this honor since the relocation from Houston. He was the fifth player from the 1983 NFL draft class to be enshrined, joining Dan Marino, Eric Dickerson, John Elway, and Jim Kelly; Darrell Green, Richard Dent, and Jim Covert later became the sixth, seventh, and eighth members. Matthews was selected as a guard on the NFL's All-Decade Team of the 1990s. In 2010, he was ranked 78th on \"\" by the NFL Network. At the 2020 Super Bowl, Matthews was named to the NFL 100 All-Time Team as one of the top 100 players of the first 100 years of the NFL.\nPersonal life.\nMatthews comes from a football family. A devout Christian as evidenced in his Hall of Fame Speech, Matthews is the son of Clay Matthews Sr., who played in the NFL in the 1950s. His brother, Clay Jr., also played 19 seasons in the NFL. Bruce is the uncle of linebacker Clay Matthews III, former NFL linebacker Casey Matthews, and Kyle Matthews of USC football. Bruce and his wife, Carrie, have seven kids: Steven, Kevin, Marilyn, Jake, Mike, Luke, and Gwen. Kevin Matthews played center for Texas A&amp;M until the 2009 football season and then played in the NFL for five years as a member of the Titans and Carolina Panthers. Jake Matthews played offensive tackle for Texas A&amp;M and is currently the starting left tackle of the Atlanta Falcons. Mike Matthews played on the offensive line for Texas A&amp;M, where he was the starting center. His youngest son, Luke, is currently a senior at Texas A&amp;M. Matthews is also the uncle of tight end Troy Niklas by way of his wife's sister."

        "title": "Waikato Rugby Union",
        "text": "The Waikato Rugby Union (WRU) is the official governing body of rugby union in the Waikato area in the North Island of New Zealand. Headquartered in Hamilton, WRU was founded in 1921.\nIts senior representative team, nicknamed the \"Mooloos\", competes in the Mitre 10 Cup (formerly known as the ITM Cup and Air New Zealand Cup), and won the inaugural Air New Zealand Cup in 2006. The squad plays its home fixtures at the Waikato Stadium in Hamilton. The union's colours are red, yellow and black.\nHistory.\nWaikato Rugby Union was founded in 1921. The inaugural representative match played ended in a 15-all draw against Taranaki. Waikato had its first win by their third fixture when they defeated Manawatu 6–0. The first home match was played against New South Wales from Australia at the Claudelands Showground, losing 11 to 28. In 1925 the Rugby Park was opened, and in 1928 Waikato adopted their now famous colours of red, yellow and black.\nIn 1932 Waikato challenged Canterbury for the Ranfurly Shield. The challenge was unsuccessful. Waikato made another unsuccessful challenge for the shield in 1949 against Otago. In 1951 Waikato successfully challenged for the Ranfurly Shield, defeating North Auckland 6 points to 3. They defeated Auckland the following season, also 6–3 to win back the shield. In 1966 Waikato defeated Auckland again to regain the Ranfurly Shield. In 1980 Waikato won the Ranfurly Shield for the first time since 1966, defeating Auckland 7 points to 3.\nIn 1954 Waikato had 11 wins and one draw from 14 matches and were tabbed the champions. The draw was in a remarkable Ranfurly Shield challenge where they drew 14 all. The country had never seen anything like this before, Christchurch was invaded by thousands of Mooloo supporters who were led by the president at the time, Horace 'Cal' Calcott. The Mooloo express captured the imagination of fans nationwide. These images were vividly remembered by many who attended.\nArthur Stone, as a nineteen year old scored the only try in Waikato's Ranfurly Shield challenge against holders Auckland in 1980. In front of a crowd of 47,000, second division Waikato won the shield as a result 7-3. Arthur Stone intercepted an Auckland pass and scored in the left hand corner. Keith Quinn, famously said \"Has he got the legs? Arthur Stone. He's just having a go…now that is a great try for nineteen year-old Arthur Stone.\"\nWaikato became the first Union to win the National Provincial Championship (NPC) when the format included semi-final and finals structure for the 1992 season. Waikato defeated Otago 40 to 5 in the final. 1993 was also very successful for Waikato; winning back the Ranfurly Shield with a 17 to 6 victory over Auckland, and making it to the semi-finals of the NPC, only to be defeated by Otago.\nWaikato defeated Taranaki 40 to 19 for a successful challenge for the Ranfurly Shield in 1996, and defeated Auckland 31 to 29 for the shield in 1997. That season they also made it to the semi-finals of the NPC, but were defeated by Counties Manukau 40 to 43. In 1998 they made it to the final of the NPC, in what was a rematch of the 1992 final, against Otago. Waikato lost the match 20 to 49. They made it to the semi-finals the next season, but were defeated by Wellington 17 to 38.\nIn 2002 Waikato made it to their first NPC final since the 1998 loss to Otago. Though they were defeated by Auckland, 28 to 40. They made it as far as the semi-finals in both the 2003 and the 2004 seasons, and were defeated by Wellington 29–30 and 16–28 respectively.\nUnder the new Air New Zealand Cup format, Waikato became the first side to win the competition, defeating Wellington 37–31 in the final. It was the first time in fourteen years that Waikato had won the national provincial competition.\nIn 2007 Waikato began with wins over Manawatu, Southland and Counties Manukau before defeating North Harbour 52–7 in a Ranfurly Shield Challenge. They set a record for the biggest win from a challenger on the road. However, they lost the Ranfurly Shield a week later to Canterbury 20–33. They reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to Hawkes Bay 35–38 at McLean Park.\n2008 saw the Mooloo men start slow with three losses and one draw. However, they defeated Auckland 34–13 at Waikato Stadium and wins over Counties Manukau, Otago and Taranaki saw the Mooloo men reach the quarter-finals, where they once again lost to Hawkes Bay.\nWaikato began the 2009 like their previous season before defeating Counties Manukau, Hawkes Bay, Wellington, Taranaki, North Harbour, Otago and Northland to finish 6th.\nIn 2010 Waikato had notable wins over Auckland and Canterbury to reach the semi-finals where they won a nail-biting 38–37 victory over Auckland at Eden Park to reach the ITM Cup final for the first time since 2006. Canterbury eventually won 33–13.\nWaikato were placed in the Premiership for 2011 and won seven of their ten games including wins over Canterbury (Christchurch) Wellington (Waikato Stadium) and Auckland (Waikato Stadium). Their only blight was losing to Bay of Plenty 8–36 in Rotorua and to Manawatu 20–54 in Palmerston North. They reach the ITM Cup final, but lost to Canterbury 3–12 at Waikato Stadium.\nWaikato started the 2012 ITM Cup with two wins from six matches. However, they would win their last four matches, including retaining the Ranfurly Shield for the first time since 2007 with a 46–10 win over Taranaki at Yarrows Stadium. They later defended the Ranfurly Shield in their final game of the season against Hawkes Bay 28–3. This relegated Hawkes Bay to the Championship. Waikato finished fifth.\nIn 2013 Waikato played two Ranfurly Shield matches in Morrinsville and Ruatoria against Heartland Opposition. They defeated both Horowhenua Kapiti and East Coast before the 2013 ITM Cup season. Waikato started their Ranfurly Shield campaign with a 31–22 win over Northland. However, the following week they lost the shield to Otago 19–26. They had an impressive 42–24 win over Auckland at Waikato Stadium. They would also challenge for the shield once again in 2013 against Counties Manukau at Pukekohe. Waikato lost 25–37 to Counties Manukau. This was their first lost to Counties Manukau since 2000. Waikato would defeat Bay of Plenty and Taranaki to survive relegation and finish 5th like the previous season.\n2014 was another dismal season for Waikato having record losses to Taranaki 17–46 (Waikato Stadium), Otago 7–38 (Forsyth Barr Stadium) and Auckland 19–60 (Eden Park). Their bright spot was beating Wellington in the capital for the first time since 2002 and winning other matches against North Harbour, Counties Manukau and Bay of Plenty to finish 6th and avoid relegation to the championship\n2015 was another dismal season for Waikato having lost to Tasman 20-35 (Waikato Stadium) then they beat Manawatu 28-21 (Central Energy Trust Arena) and another victory over Bay of Plenty 43-10 (Tauranga Domain) and then they lost to Auckland 28-50 (Waikato Stadium) and then they beat Southland 30-25 (Waikato Stadium) afterwards, they were blown away by a 0-41 loss to Taranaki (Yarrow Stadium), and then they lost to Canterbury 17-18 (AMI Stadium) and then they lost to Wellington 14-21 (Waikato Stadium) and then they lost to Counties Manukau 9-30 (Waikato Stadium) but they ended their season on a good note after snatching the Ranfurly Shield of Hawke's Bay (36-30), Waikato came 6th in the Premiership\n2016 was better for Waikato as they finished 5th, but they opened with a 19-24 loss to Tasman, and then they retained the Shield after beating North Harbour 26-15, they retained the Shield again after beating Manawatu 19-10, they then beat Auckland at Eden Park 35-32, and then they drew with Taranaki for the Shield 20-20, and then they had a repeat of 2015 against Counties Manukau when they lost a 26-35 match in Pukekohe, they lost the Shield to Canterbury 23-29, and then lost to Northland 27-48, they defeated Hawke's Bay 46-22 and beat Wellington 28-24\nIn 2017, Waikato began with a loss to Taranaki (34-29) but struck back with a win of Counties Manukau (33-21). They got thrashed by Northland (37-7), punished by Manawatu (10-23) and struck by Wellington (10-24), rumbled by Canterbury (37-17), edged by North Harbour (11-13) and finished by Bay of Plenty (36-32). Waikato were relegated to the championship\n2018 saw Waikato start with a loss to Manawatu (24-19), edged by North Harbour (28-29) and stuffed by Auckland (35-17). But they came from behind to snatch a victory against Wellington (43-31), and had a victory that saw them steal the Ranfurly Shield from Taranaki (19-33), defended the Shield from Hawke's Bay (42-22), killed off Bay of Plenty (21-54), squashed Southland to stop them from stealing the Shield (42-11) and battled it out with Northland (28-71)\nInternational results.\nIn 1930 Waikato provided 14 of the 15 players of the combination team that played Great Britain at Rugby Park. The visitors won the match 40 to 16 in front of 13,000 people. In 1937 toured New Zealand. Five Waikato players were involved in the combined side which lost 6–3 in front of a record crowd of more than 17,000. Waikato was the first provincial Union to beat a touring South African team post World War II, defeating the Springboks 14 points to 10 in 1956. Waikato defeating another large rugby nation, with a 22 – 3 victory over in 1961.\nDuring the 1970s Waikato defeated numerous international sides; including a two-point victory, 26 to 24, over , a 13 to 7 win over and defeating France for the second time, 18 to 15. Also during the 1980s, Waikato achieved a number of notable international victories, defeating , and in the latter years of the decade. Waikato also completed a number of international victories during the 1990s, with wins over Canada, Australia, Western Samoa, and .\nWaikato have also attained the scalp of the British Lions in 1993.\nNotable players.\nAll Blacks.\nWaikato players who have represented New Zealand:\nWaikato Centurions.\nThese players have played 100 or more games for Waikato:\nStrip.\nPrior to 1928, black and white and blue and black colours had been used. However, since 1928 they have worn the very distinctive red, yellow and black hooped jersey, with white shorts. These colours being a combination of the Hamilton (yellow and black), with Old Boys (red and black). Unlike many professional sporting teams in the modern era, Waikato have always retained the traditional design of the jersey. The main jersey/apparel sponsors are Waikato Draught, Lonestar, Gallagher and Kukri. As of 2016, apparel was being supplied by sporting firm Kukri.\nSupporters.\nThe Waikato supporters are known for their use of cowbells at home matches. This tradition has been carried over to home matches of the Chiefs during Super Rugby home games. The Waikato mascot is a cow called Mooloo.\nThere is also one very special supporter who attends every home game, this man is widely known as Possum. He is situated up the top of a cherry picker which looks over the entire stadium and can be seen from any angle around the ground. Every few seconds he revs his chainsaw to show his passion and love for the Waikato rugby team. This is also a ploy in which to distract opposition players.\nStadium.\nWaikato play their home games at Waikato Stadium in Hamilton, built on the site of the club's former ground, Rugby Park. Construction began on the stadium in 2000; it was completed in 2001, and opened with a game between the Chiefs and Crusaders in the then Super 12. The Chiefs also play the majority of their home games at the stadium.\nWaikato played out of Rugby Park from 1925 to 2000. For the 1921 to 1924 seasons, Waikato played at the Claudelands Showgrounds and Steele Park. Waikato's first ever home match was played at the Claudelands Showgrounds against New South Wales, which Waikato lost 11 to 28. The Rugby Park grandstand roof collapsed in 1934, but no one was injured.\nWaikato Stadium hosted the first ever Air New Zealand Cup final, where Waikato defeated Wellington to claim the title.\nWaikato in Super Rugby.\nWhen the NZRFU were initially deciding the team compositions for the Super 12 in 1995, it was decided that to have the Blues franchise encompass the North Harbour, Counties-Manukau, Northland and Auckland provincial rugby unions to be unfair. This was due to the preponderance of All Blacks (players representing New Zealand) who came from North Harbour, Counties-Manukau and Auckland at the time. Hence if the Blues were to consist of these unions, they would field an All Blacks team in all but name.\nThis led to North Harbour and Northland being represented by the nearest other team, the Chiefs (at the time named the Waikato Chiefs), also composed of Waikato, Bay of Plenty, and King Country. In 1999 the Chiefs (\"Waikato\" having been dropped from the title) boundaries were redrawn, with Northland and North Harbour moving to the Blues, and Counties-Manukau and Thames Valley coming under the Chiefs franchise. This represents the current Chiefs franchise unions.\nThe Chiefs share a home base and main stadium with Waikato, being Hamilton and Waikato Stadium respectively.\nRanfurly Shield.\nWaikato first won the Ranfurly shield in 1951, when they held it for 6 successful defences. They have a proud shield history, having defended it 57 times, the third most defences by any union. Waikato have held the shield for the following periods:\nClub Rugby.\nBefore the formation of provincial wide club rugby, the seven sub-unions had their own individual championships, with club rugby dating back to the 1870s.\n1966 saw the first major change when the Morrinsville, Lower Waikato, Cambridge and Te Awamutu sub-unions combined for a joint two-tier championship with eight teams in first division and nine teams in second division. In this year St Pat’s (Te Awamutu) and Kereone (Morrinsville) shared the first division title and Te Akau (Lower Waikato) and Te Awamutu Old Boys finished first equal in the second division.\nThen in 1967 the Hamilton, Matamata and South Waikato sub-unions joined and the first true Waikato wide draw was formed with 16 clubs in two divisions. Putaruru Athletic were the first winners of the Waikato Breweries Shield with Hamilton Old Boys runners up.\nWomen's rugby.\nWaikato has a proud history in Women's rugby, providing many players for the Black Ferns and Women's Provincial Championship over the years. The players that follow are notable players of women's rugby."

        "title": "1924 Stanley Cup playoffs",
        "text": "The 1924 Stanley Cup playoffs was the third and final year in which the National Hockey League (NHL) champions, the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champions, and the Western Canada Hockey League (WCHL) champions all competed for the Stanley Cup (the PCHA and the WCHL would later merge after the season). The playoffs began on March 18, 1924, and concluded on March 25 when the NHL champion Montreal Canadiens defeated the WCHL champion Calgary Tigers in the final series, two games to zero.\nBackground.\nMontreal finished second overall in the 1923–24 NHL regular season standings with a 13–11 record, behind the 16–8 Ottawa Senators. However, the Canadiens upset the Senators in the two-game total goal league champion series, 5 goals to 2, to win the NHL title.\nCalgary finished the 1923–24 WCHL regular season with an 18–11–1 record. The Tigers then defeated the 17–11–2 second place Regina Capitals in the WCHL championship series, tying Game 1 in Regina, 2–2, and then winning 2–0 in Calgary.\nThe 1923–24 PCHA season was capped with the 13–6–1 Vancouver Maroons defeating the 14–16–1 Seattle Metropolitans in a two-game league championship series.\nPre-Cup playoffs news.\nBoth rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs were scheduled to be played on the NHL winner's home ice, with Montreal having to face both the PCHA and the WCHL champions. However, Canadiens owner Leo Dandurand claimed that Calgary and Vancouver were inferior to his. He therefore wanted the two western teams to face off against each other, and then have the Canadiens play the winner in the final round. PCHA President Frank Patrick refused to go along with that idea and instead proposed a compromise in which the host team's (Montreal's) customary contribution towards the two other clubs' travel expenses would be cut in half.\nBut in order to generate the additional money, Calgary and Vancouver decided to play a three-game series before going to Montreal, with the loser having to face the Canadiens in the first round of the Stanley Cup playoffs. Games were played in Vancouver, Calgary, and Winnipeg, with the Tigers coming back from a Game 1 loss to win the next two contests.\nDespite this extra series between the Tigers and the Maroons, Montreal still had to defeat both western teams in order to win the Cup.\nStanley Cup Semifinals.\nThe Canadiens swept the Maroons in two, one-goal victories in the best-of-three series. Billy Boucher scored the game-winning goal in Montreal's 3–2 victory in the Game 1. In Game 2, Vancouver scored first on a goal by Billy's brother, Frank Boucher. But Billy scored two goals of his own to give the Canadiens a 2–1 win and clinch the series.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nMontreal also swept Calgary in the best-of-three series to clinch the Cup. In the first game, rookie Howie Morenz recorded a hat-trick as he led the Canadiens to a 6–1 victory. The second game was then moved to the artificial ice at Ottawa Auditorium in Ottawa because of poor ice conditions at Mount Royal Arena.

        "text": "The Poland national rugby union team () represents Poland in men's international rugby union competitions. Nicknamed The White and Reds (\"Biało-czerwoni\"), is considered one of the stronger tier 3 teams in European rugby and currently compete in the second division of the Rugby Europe International Championships in the Rugby Europe Trophy, a competition which is just below the Rugby Europe Championship where the top 6 countries in Europe (apart from the teams in the 6 nations) compete. They are yet to participate in any Rugby World Cup and often play in white with red shorts as well as in red with white shorts.\nHistory.\nPoland made their international debut against East Germany in 1958 in Łódź, which they won by just one point, 9–8. Later that year they played in Krasnoyarsk, who defeated them 11–3. The following year they played two matches at Dinamo Stadion in Bucharest, defeating Czechoslovakia and then losing to Romania. Poland continued to contest internationals with these nations over the coming years.\nThey defeated East Germany in Grimma the 1971, this was followed by strong form from the Polish, winning matches against the Netherlands, Morocco, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union. In 1975 Poland played Italy in Treviso, and lost 13–28. In 1977 Poland played a France XV again, and lost 9–26; also that year they played Italy, and lost by only six points, with the final score being 6–12. They played a France XV again in 1978, losing 24–35. They also defeated Spain that year.\nPoland played Italy in 1979, losing 3–13, and then played a France XV the following year, though they did not perform as well as previous meetings, losing 42–0. A subsequent match against a France XV in 1981 saw the France XV defeat Poland 49–6. A match between the two sides in 1984 produced a good result for the Polish, losing 19–3. A match against the Italian Barbarians the following year produced the same scoreline.\nIn 1987 Poland played two Italian teams, the Italian Barbarians and Italy under-21, although they lost to the Barbarians, they won against the under-21 team. Poland did not play at the 1987 World Cup. In 1990 they played the full Italy team in Naples, losing 34–3. Poland did not play in the 1991 World Cup in England. From 1992 to 1993 Poland won six matches in a row. Russia won five to 41 in a following match.\nPoland played Italy A, but lost 19–107. Poland also played Romania in 1998, losing 74–13. Poland were grouped in Pool D of round two of the 2007 Rugby World Cup European qualify tournament. Poland performed very well in the pool, winning all four of their games, and finishing at the top of the pool. This saw them through to Pool A of Round three, but they were knocked out here, finishing fourth in the pool.\nIn the 2021/2022 season, the Polish team secured 2nd place in the Trophy(2nd Division), trailing behind Belgium. This achievement earned Poland a spot in the Championship (1st Division, for the 2023 and 2024 editions.\nDuring the first edition, unfortunately, Poland suffered its largest defeat in history, losing 65-3 against Portugal. In a subsequent game, Poland secured its first historic victory in the Championship by defeating Belgium in Gdansk, Poland. Despite this milestone, Poland finished 8th, placing last in this edition of the Championship.\nBetween the two editions, a commemorative friendly match was organized in honor of the Armistice and the Polish National Independence Day, featuring the Polish rugby team and the British Armed Forces team. Held at the National Stadium in Gdansk, the match concluded with a narrow victory for Poland, 17-14, marking a moment of pride and shared remembrance between the two nations.\nIn the 2024 edition, they lost all their games and finished 8th once again, which resulted in their relegation to the Trophy (2nd division). This marked the last match for the iconic player of the team, Grzegorz Buczek (as a captain), which took place at the Jean Bouin Stadium of the Stade Français club in Paris, in a ranking match against Belgium.\nRecord.\nOverall.\nUpdated on 2 March 2024, after match with .\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were selected for the 2021–22 Rugby Europe Trophy match against Switzerland on 20th November 2021.\nHead Coach: Christian Hitt\nCaps updated: 22nd November 2021, after match with Switzerland. \nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have also been called up to the squad within the last 12 months.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff of the Polish national team:"

        "text": "Matthew J. Thornton (born September 15, 1976), is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Born in Three Rivers, Michigan he grew up and attended high school in Centreville. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, and San Diego Padres. Thornton is second all-time in American League history in holds (182).\nCollege and minor league baseball.\nIn the 1995 MLB draft, Thornton was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 27th round (742nd overall) but chose not to sign with them. Thornton played college baseball for Grand Valley State University and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round (22nd overall) of the 1998 MLB draft.\nThornton made his professional debut with the Single-A Everett AquaSox in the Northwest League, recording a 27.00 ERA in two games. In and , Thornton was a starting pitcher with the Single-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League, and showed improvement with his ball control and accuracy, striking out nearly one batter per inning. In , Thornton had a breakout year for the Single-A San Bernardino Stampede in the California League, where he posted a 14–7 record in 27 starts, along with a stellar 2.52 ERA and 192 strikeouts in only 157 innings pitched.\nThornton was then promoted to AA baseball and played with the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League in . Thornton, still a starting pitcher, pitched well, making 12 starts and going 1–5 with a 3.63 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 62 innings pitched. In , Thornton was briefly sent back down to High-A ball with the Inland Empire 66ers of the California League, but was quickly promoted back up AA ball with the San Antonio Missions again. He started only four games, but posted an incredible 0.36 ERA, with a 3–1 record, gave up only eight hits in 25.1 innings of work and struck out 18 batters. His performance got him promoted that same year to AAA ball with the Tacoma Rainiers in the Pacific Coast League. Thornton had a shaky start to his career in Triple-A ball, starting two games and posting an 0–2 record and an 8.00 ERA.\nThornton stayed with the Tacoma Rainiers in and posted a 7–5 record in 16 games (15 starts), along with a 5.20 ERA and 74 strikeouts in 83 innings pitched.\nMajor Leagues.\nSeattle Mariners.\n2004.\nThornton made his MLB debut on June 27, , with the Mariners in a game against the San Diego Padres, pitching brilliantly over four innings, only allowing three hits and striking out one batter. Throughout the season, the Mariners used Thornton for mostly middle reliever duty, except for one game on July 10, when he started on against the Chicago White Sox. He pitched five innings, allowing four runs on three hits and walking seven batters in a loss. Thornton finished the 2004 season with a 1–2 record and 4.13 ERA in 19 games (one start), striking out 30 batters in 32.2 innings of work.\n2005.\nIn 2005, Thornton served his reliever duties, pitching in 55 games and going 0–4 with a 5.21 ERA. He struck out 57 batters in 57 innings pitched.\nChicago White Sox.\n2006.\nOn March 20, , Thornton was traded from the Seattle Mariners to the Chicago White Sox in exchange for outfielder Joe Borchard. Under the tutelage of pitching coach Don Cooper, Thornton emerged as a dominant bullpen force. In the 2006 season, Thornton appeared in 63 games, going 5–3 with two saves and a 3.33 ERA.\n2007.\nThornton's 2007 season was a little busier, as he made 68 relief appearances with a 4–4 record, two saves and a 4.79 ERA.\n2008.\nThornton made 74 appearances out of the bullpen in 2008, going 5–3 with one save and a 2.67 ERA.\n2009.\nThornton made 70 appearances in 2009, going 6–3 with four saves and a 2.74 ERA.\n2010.\nThornton was selected by the coaches' vote to the American League All-Star team in 2010, the first All-Star selection of his career. In 2010, he made 61 appearances, going 5–4 with eight saves and a 2.67 ERA.\n2011.\nAppearing in 62 games in 2011, Thornton went 2–5 with three saves and a 3.32 ERA.\n2012.\n2012 was somewhat unlucky for Thornton, as his loss column led all relievers in baseball. He went 4–10 with three saves and a 3.46 ERA in 74 relief appearances.\n2013.\nThornton made 40 appearances for the White Sox to start the 2013 season, going 0–3 and a 3.86 ERA.\nIn 512 career relief appearances with the White Sox spanning 463.1 innings, Thornton compiled a 3.28 ERA. As of September 12, he led all eligible American League relievers with 12.3 strikeouts per nine innings.\nFrom 2008 to 2013, Thornton pitched in more games than any other left-handed reliever. He also holds the record for most holds with a single team, with 164 for the White Sox.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn July 12, 2013, Thornton was traded to the Boston Red Sox for minor league outfielder Brandon Jacobs. The Red Sox also received cash considerations. For the rest of the 2013 season with the Red Sox, Thornton's playing time was limited due to an oblique strain, but he made 20 appearances out of the bullpen, going 0–1 with a 3.52 ERA. Overall in 2013, combined with both teams, Thornton made 60 total relief appearances going 0–4 and a 3.74 ERA. The Red Sox finished 97–65, making it to the postseason and eventually winning the World Series over the St. Louis Cardinals. Thornton, although he did not make any postseason appearances, still received his first career championship ring.\nNew York Yankees.\nOn January 10, 2014, Thornton signed a two-year contract with the New York Yankees worth $7 million. In 46 games for the Yankees, Thornton was 0–3 with a 2.55 ERA. He was put on waivers late in the season in what General Manager Brian Cashman said was a move for \"roster flexibility\".\nIn 2014, Thornton reached second on the all-time list for holds in Major League Baseball, trailing only Arthur Rhodes.\nWashington Nationals.\nThornton was claimed by the Washington Nationals after being waived by the Yankees in August, 2014. He pitched in 18 games for Washington down the stretch, going 1–0 and posting a perfect 0.00 ERA. Thornton appeared in three games in the 2014 National League Division Series against the San Francisco Giants, going 0–1 with a 3.86 ERA. Thornton made 60 appearances for Washington in 2015, compiling a 2–1 record and a 2.18 ERA with 23 strikeouts in 41 innings. Since 2005, Thornton had recorded the most innings of any left-handed reliever.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn March 3, 2016, Thornton signed a minor league deal with the San Diego Padres with an invitation to Spring training. He was designated for assignment on August 6, 2016.\nRetirement.\nOn November 8, 2016, Thornton announced his retirement from professional baseball.\nPitching style.\nSince transitioning to the bullpen with the White Sox, Thornton has scrapped his secondary pitches and now relies heavily on a mid- to upper-90s four-seam fastball. In 2010, Thornton has thrown the fastball over 90% of the time. He also occasionally throws a slider, which he uses most effectively against right-handed batters. His fastball command is considered excellent."

        "text": "The 1920 Stanley Cup Finals was contested by the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Ottawa Senators and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Seattle Metropolitans. The Senators won the series by three games to two in the best-of-five game series. Although all of the games for the series were scheduled to be played at The Arena in Ottawa, unseasonably warm weather and poor ice conditions forced the last two contests to be played on the artificial ice at Toronto's Arena Gardens.\nThis would be the last Stanley Cup Finals appearance for a team based on the West Coast of the United States until the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals. It is the last Finals appearance by a Seattle-based team to date.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Senators captured the 1919–20 NHL title after they won both halves of the regular season, thus eliminating the need for a league championship playoff. Meanwhile, Seattle finished the 1919–20 PCHA regular season in first place with a 12–10 record, but had to defeat the second place Vancouver Millionaires in a two-game total goals championship series, 7–3, to win the PCHA title.\nThe location of the series was under dispute. As the 1919 series was not completed, the PCHA wanted the 1920 series to take place out west. The NHL opposed the idea. The PCHA proposed playing the series in Winnipeg, but this was still not agreed to by the NHL. While the dispute continued, the schedules for both leagues was allowed to drag out, leading to a late starting date for the Finals.\nGame summaries.\nSeattle's green, red, and white uniforms looked almost alike to Ottawa's black, red, and white uniforms. The Senators agreed to play in white sweaters. The rules alternated for each game, starting with eastern rules.\nThe puck was dropped for the first game of the series by Stanley Cup trustee William Foran to the centers Frank Nighbor and Frank Foyston. The ice became soft and pools of water developed. Foyston scored two goals in the first period to put Seattle ahead 2–0. Nighbor scored on a shot that ricocheted off Morris of Seattle with 40 seconds to play in the second period. Nighbor tied it at the ten-minute mark of the third period. Jack Darragh scored the game-winning goal with four minutes to play on an assist from Eddie Gerard.\nVancouver Mayor Robert Gale dropped the puck to start game two, played under seven-man PCHA rules. Goaltender Clint Benedict led the Senators to a 3–0 shutout win. Ice conditions were again wet. Darragh scored at the 14-minute mark of the first period. In the third, Gerard stick-handled in and scored after six minutes. Nighbor finished the scoring with his third goal of the series with one minute to play.rom\nBefore game three, snow was placed onto the natural ice to make the ice harder and removed prior to the game. The ice softened, however, as the game progressed. Seattle won game three, 3–1, in a game notable for having no penalties called. Seattle outplayed Ottawa but the score was kept close by Benedict. The first goal was scored at five minutes of the first, by George Boucher to put Ottawa ahead 1–0. Riley of Seattle scored to tie the game with two minutes to play in the first. Seattle took the lead on a goal by Foyston, after a steal by Walker from Darragh. The final goal was scored by Rickey on another set-up by Walker.\nBy consensus of league and team officials, the series was shifted to Toronto because of Ottawa's slushy ice conditions (The Ottawa Arena did not have artificial ice). Ottawa objected, but NHL president Frank Calder\nstood firm.\nIn game four Foyston scored after three minutes to give the Mets a lead which they did not relinquish. Rowe scored at the eight-minute mark to put the Mets ahead 2-0. In the second period, Nighbor scored after two minutes to draw Ottawa close. At the 6:55 mark, Walker scored on a back-hand to put Seattle again two goals ahead, before Nighbor scored his second to make the score 3–2 after two periods. Seattle scored twice in the third to win the game 5–2 and even the series.\nIn the fifth game, Rowe scored after ten minutes to put Seattle ahead 1–0, but Ottawa scored the next six to win the game 6–1. Boucher scored four minutes after Rowe to tie the score after one period. The score remained 1–1 after two periods. Darragh then scored after five minutes of the third to put Ottawa ahead. Gerard stick-handled through the Seattle team to put Ottawa ahead 3–1 three minutes later. Darragh then scored twice within a minute to record a hat-trick. Nighbor scored to finish the scoring.\nSeattle forward Frank Foyston had high praise for the Ottawa team after the series had concluded, and gave credit to all of Frank Nighbor, Jack Darragh and Eddie Gerard on the Senators forward line:\nFor the series, Nighbor led in goals with six, while Foyston and Darragh scored five. Benedict recorded a 2.20 goals against average (GAA) during the series. Hap Holmes recorded a 3.00 GAA. It was Holmes' fourth consecutive Stanley Cup Finals, and his fifth to that point (1914, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1920). Each Senator received $390.19 in prize money, while each Metropolitan received $319.39.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1920 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Senators never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season.\nIt was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1920 Ottawa Senators\" was put onto its then-new collar. \nThe following Senators players and staff were members of the Stanley Cup winning team.\n1919–20 Ottawa Senators"

        "text": "Hubert \"Hugh\" Evans (November 8, 1940 – July 8, 2022) was an American basketball referee in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for 28 seasons. He worked 1,969 regular season NBA games and 35 NBA Finals games during his NBA officiating career from 1972 to 2001. He subsequently served as an assistant supervisor of officials in the NBA front office.\nEarly life.\nEvans was born in Squire, West Virginia, in 1940. He studied at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, where he played basketball and baseball for the Aggies. After graduating, he was selected in the 12th round (80th overall) of the 1963 NBA draft by the St. Louis Hawks, becoming the third player from A&amp;T to be drafted by an NBA team after Al Attles and Herbert Gray. However, Evans opted to pursue baseball and played several seasons in the minor leagues for the San Francisco Giants. During the 1963 season, he posted a .288 batting average with 6 home runs and 25 runs batted in (RBI) in 48 games for the Salem Rebels, a Giants affiliate playing in the Appalachian League.\nCareer.\nEvans relocated to New York City and was director of a community center in Brooklyn by 1968. He paid $100 to sign up for an officials’ camp – later calling it \"the best investment I ever made\" – and officiated amateur basketball games in the summer league held at Rucker Park in Harlem. The camp director soon asked him whether he would be interested in refereeing professional games. Evans subsequently agreed a part-time contract with the NBA in 1972 to officiate 47 games, before becoming a full-time referee the following year. He became the second NBA referee to come from a historically Black college or university after Ken Hudson.\nEvans ultimately officiated 1,969 regular-season games, 170 playoff games, 35 NBA Finals, and four NBA All-Star Games throughout his 28-year career. One memorable game he officiated was Game 5 of the 1984 NBA Finals, in which he became dehydrated and fainted at one point. He worked the first half of the game, but was replaced by John Vanak for the second half. This game was played in 97-degree heat in Boston Garden. During the 1995–96 NBA season, Evans was ranked the second best official in the league by coaches, general managers, and NBA Senior Vice President, Basketball Operations Rod Thorn. His final game was Game 4 of the 2001 NBA Finals, played at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on June 13, 2001. Evans wore the uniform number 25 during his career in the NBA.\nLater life.\nAfter retiring as a referee in 2001, Evans became an assistant supervisor of NBA officials, a position he held till 2003. He was inducted into New York City Basketball Hall of Fame and North Carolina A&amp;T Hall of Fame in 2002. In April 2022, a few months before his death, he was named to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, to become one of six NBA referees at date honored in the hall. He was enshrined posthumously in September 2022.\nPersonal life.\nEvans was married to Cathy until his death. Hugh had two children: Aaron and Todd. He later moved to the Atlanta metropolitan area.\nEvans died on the morning of July 8, 2022 from congestive heart failure."

        "title": "Lithuania national rugby union team",
        "text": "The Lithuania national rugby union team () represents Lithuania in men's international rugby union competitions. Nicknamed The Knights (\"Vytis\"), is considered one of the relatively stronger tier 3 teams in European rugby and currently compete in the second division of the Rugby Europe International Championships in the Rugby Europe Trophy, a competition which is just below the Rugby Europe Championship where the top 6 countries in Europe (apart from the teams in the 6 nations) compete. They are yet to participate in any Rugby World Cup and play in black with a pattern involving the colours red, yellow and green (the colours of the Lithuanian flag).\nHistory.\nRugby was first introduced into Lithuania in 1961. However, as the country was a part of USSR, the national team could not be formed. After the collapse of the USSR, Lithuania could finally form their very own national team where they would start playing unofficial friendlies against Latvia, their traditional rivals as well as representative team from Kaliningrad before finally playing their first official game against Germany, in 1993 where they lost with the score 31-5.\nAfter the reestablishment of independence in 1990, Lithuania's rugby authorities worked to gain international recognition after gaining continental recognition in 1991 by FIRA Europe (as it was known at the time) and by 1993, the national team were participating in the qualifying for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. Lithuania also participated in the 1992-1994 FIRA Trophy competition at the bottom of the pyramid but failed to win any of their games. Later on in 1996, Lithuania had achieved their first official victory against Luxembourg during the qualifying competition for the 1999 World Cup. Overall, the 1990s were a poor decade for the national team, yet it must be considered that they were a relatively new country, never mind the fact that Lithuania started playing test match rugby in 1993.\nUp until 2006, Lithuania was lingering in the middle of the third division of the European Nations Cup. However, a 100 percent record in their 2006-2008 European Nations Cup Third Division campaign earned them promotion from Division 3B to Division 3A. This effort was followed by another perfect record in the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup Third Division and a further promotion to Division 2A. Moreover, victories over Israel and the Netherlands would take them to the semifinal round of the European qualification tournament for a spot in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final Place Play-off. The rise in form of the national had thus resulted in an increase in the popularity of the sport in Lithuania.\nDuring their 2008–10 European Nations Cup campaign, Lithuania was credited with setting a new record for consecutive Test wins in men's rugby. Their 77–5 away win over Serbia on April 24, 2010 was listed as their 18th straight, surpassing the previous record set by New Zealand in 1965–69 and by South Africa in 1997–98. This undefeated campaign, which could have led to a Lithuanian presence at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, ended in the 27–16 loss to Ukraine in the European qualifying semifinal. However, on later review, it was found that the first game in the 18-game sequence was in fact a loss, and as such are now credited with having held an equal record with South Africa and New Zealand (the record would later be broken by Cyprus in 2013).\nRecord.\nOverall.\nBelow is a table of the representative rugby matches played by a Lithuania national XV at test level up until 23 March 2024:\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players are in the match day squad for the 2021–22 Rugby Europe Trophy game against Switzerland on 13th November 2021.\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have also been called up to the squad within the last 12 months.\nCurrent coaching staff.\nThe current coaching staff of the Lithuanian national team:"

        "text": "The 2002 Royal Rumble was the 15th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 20, 2002, at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. It was the final Royal Rumble event produced under the WWF name, as in May, the WWF was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was also the final Royal Rumble held before the introduction of the first brand extension in March. Six matches were contested at the event. \nAs has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2002 event, the winner received a match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at WrestleMania X8—this was the last Royal Rumble until 2014 to feature one world championship. The main event was the 2002 Royal Rumble match, which was won by Triple H, who last eliminated Kurt Angle. In other prominent matches, Chris Jericho defeated The Rock to retain the Undisputed WWF Championship, Ric Flair defeated Vince McMahon in a Street Fight, and William Regal defeated Edge to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2002 event was the 15th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 20, 2002, at the Philips Arena in Atlanta, Georgia.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2002, the winner earned a match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at WrestleMania X8, following the unification of the WWF Championship and (WCW) World Championship as the Undisputed WWF Championship at Vengeance in December 2001.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nThe main feud was between Chris Jericho and The Rock for Jericho's Undisputed WWF Championship. The feud, which had begun in October 2001 while the two were members of Team WWF during the InVasion and traded the WCW Championship between them, continued at Vengeance, when Jericho defeated both The Rock and the reigning WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin to unify the titles. On the following night's episode of \"Raw\", Jericho successfully defended the Undisputed title over Stone Cold Steve Austin in a Steel Cage match with help from Booker T. During the following two weeks, Jericho had successfully defended the title against the likes of Rob Van Dam, The Big Show, and Kurt Angle. The Rock earned a match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at the Royal Rumble on the January 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\" by defeating Booker T. On the January 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", The Rock and Rob Van Dam defeated Jericho and Test when The Rock made Jericho submit with the Sharpshooter.\nThe secondary feud was between the two WWF Co-Owners Ric Flair and Vince McMahon. The feud began on the November 19 episode of \"Raw\", when Flair made his return to the WWF and revealed that he had bought Shane and Stephanie's stock to the WWF, which now meant that he and Vince were co-owners the company. On the December 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", McMahon came to the ring to share his new year's resolutions when he was interrupted by Flair. Flair reminded Vince how he had tried to hire him to come to the WWF when he was under contract with the NWA back in 1988, until Flair eventually left the NWA (which, at this point, had become WCW) and came to the WWF in 1991, and how he had won the 1992 Royal Rumble match and became WWF Champion. Flair also brought up his main event match with \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage at WrestleMania VIII. Flair then claimed that he looked through all the contracts one of which he pulled out that said \"Vince McMahon - Owner/Wrestler\" which meant that Flair could officially book Vince to wrestle at the Royal Rumble. McMahon then asked \"who has the balls\" to step into the ring with him, before Flair punched Vince in the mouth and announced that the two of them would face each other at the Royal Rumble. The following week, Flair announced that the match would be a Street Fight, which Vince agreed to. The next four weeks saw Flair and McMahon confronting each other in the build up to their match, including McMahon mocking Flair by putting on a blonde wig and one of Flair's trademak robes, before also assaulting Flair with a lead pipe. During a promo, McMahon stated he \"loves destroying lives\" and promised to destroy Flair's life at the Royal Rumble.\nOn the January 7 episode of \"Raw\", buildup towards the Royal Rumble match started, with \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin declaring his entry. Later that night, Triple H officially made his return after missing nearly eight months with a quadriceps injury, and announced that he too would be entering the Royal Rumble match. He was quickly interrupted by Kurt Angle, who then announced his intentions to enter the match, which was to be his first, and mentioned his victory over Triple H at the previous year's Royal Rumble event, when he was the reigning WWF Champion. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Angle in retaliation. During a match between Austin and Angle on the January 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Kane, The Big Show, and Triple H all interfered, leading to a huge brawl. In the end, only Triple H remained standing, until The Undertaker stared him down from the top of the ramp. On the January 14 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H stated that he wants to win the Undisputed WWF Championship. Austin came out, and they fought until The Undertaker came out, and hit Triple H with a chair, allowing Austin to hit him with the Stone Cold Stunner. The Undertaker then hit Austin with the chair. On the January 17 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Austin and Triple H defeated Angle and Booker T. After the match, The Undertaker once again came out, and stared them down.\nThe feud between Edge and William Regal continued from Vengeance. On the December 10 episode of \"Raw\", Edge mocked Regal, prompting Regal to nail him from behind with brass knuckles. On the December 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\", William Regal and Kurt Angle faced Edge and Rikishi in a tag match. After the match, Edge hit Regal with a steel chair, before giving Regal an Edgecution onto the chair, legitimately breaking his nose. On the January 7 episode of \"Raw\", Regal interfered after Edge's victory over Lance Storm and hit him with brass knuckles. Regal then challenged Edge to a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at the Royal Rumble, which Edge accepted. On the January 14 episode of \"Raw\", Edge and Rob Van Dam faced William Regal and Test, where Regal pinned Edge after once again using the brass knuckles. On the January 17 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Regal defeated Rob Van Dam when he used brass knuckles behind the referee's back. Later on that night, Regal came out during Edge's match with Test, but failed to interfere when Edge nailed him and referee Nick Patrick with a chair.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe show opened with a tag team match between Spike Dudley and Tazz, and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. The Dudley Boyz dominated Spike in the beginning, with Bubba Ray ripping off Spike's neck brace. Spike fought back by performing a Dudley Dog, but failed to capitalize. The Dudley Boyz then double-teamed Spike while the referee was preoccupied with Tazz. Tazz eventually came in, and both dominated. Stacy Keibler, who accompanied the Dudley Boyz to ringside, climbed on the apron, and attempted to distract Tazz. Tazz then locked in the Tazzmission until D-Von broke the hold. Spike then hit the Dudley Dog on Bubba and attempted to do the same on D-Von, but Spike was thrown out of the ring. D-Von then ran at Tazz in the corner which he dodged, before then applying the Tazzmission to retain the titles.\nThe second match was between Edge and William Regal for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Before the match, the referee found brass knuckles in Regal's tights, and confiscated them. The match went back and forth, until Regal knocked Edge out of the ring. Once back inside this ring, Regal applied the Regal Stretch, but Edge reached the ropes to break the hold. Edge then attempted a spear, but Regal pushed the referee in his path, incapacitating him. Regal then took out another pair of brass knuckles which he had hidden, and hit Edge with them. The referee then recovered to count the pinfall, and Regal won the title.\nThe next match was between Trish Stratus and Jazz for the WWF Women's Championship, with Jacqueline as the special guest referee. Jazz had the early advantage, focusing on Stratus' injured hand. Jazz then confronted Jacqueline, and they shoved each other. Stratus attempted to capitalize by hitting Jazz with a bulldog, but Jazz countered with a roll-up, and executed a snap DDT for a near fall. Stratus then blocked an attack in the corner, and delivered a bulldog to win the match, and retain the title.\nThe fourth match was a Street Fight between Ric Flair and Vince McMahon. Flair quickly gained the early advantage with punches and knife edge chops. McMahon then attacked him with weapons, and sent him into the ringpost and steps. McMahon then applied the figure four leglock, but Flair reversed it. McMahon reached the ropes, and retreated outside the ring. Flair then hit McMahon with a low blow, a television monitor, and a lead pipe. Flair then forced McMahon to submit to the figure four leglock to win the match.\nThe semi-main event was between Chris Jericho and The Rock for the Undisputed WWF Championship. The Rock quickly took control of the match and got a near-fall following a samoan drop. However, Jericho soon regained control, and removed the padding off one of the turnbuckles. Jericho then attempted the Walls of Jericho, but The Rock escaped. Jericho continued his control, until The Rock delivered a superplex, and a snap overhead belly to belly suplex. Jericho retaliated with two Lionsaults. The Rock then countered an attempted missile dropkick, and applied the Sharpshooter. Just then, Lance Storm and Christian distracted the referee as Jericho submitted, meaning the Rock could not win the title. As The Rock disposed of them, Jericho took advantage and executed a Rock Bottom and attempted a People's Elbow, but The Rock avoided it and threw Jericho out of the ring. Jericho then gained back some control and tried to hit a Rock Bottom through the Spanish announce table, but The Rock countered and executed a Rock Bottom of his own through the English announce table. Back in the ring, The Rock covered Jericho for a close near-fall. Jericho then countered another attempted Rock Bottom and again applied the Walls of Jericho, but The Rock reached the ropes and rolled Jericho up for another close near-fall on the second attempt. The Rock then accidentally hit the referee, and Jericho took advantage by hitting The Rock with the WWF title belt. Jericho then signaled for Nick Patrick (a heel referee) to come out and referee the match. The Rock then executed a DDT, but Patrick refused to count the pinfall. The Rock then attacked Patrick with a Rock Bottom, and executed a Spinebuster and a People's Elbow on Jericho. As The Rock tried to revive the original referee, Earl Hebner, Jericho again took advantage and hit a low blow, and sent The Rock into the exposed turnbuckle. Jericho then pinned The Rock with a roll-up using the ropes as extra leverage to retain the title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match. The Undertaker, the eighth entrant, dominated upon entering the match, and eliminated all four of the remaining participants. Matt Hardy entered next and Lita, who accompanied Matt, entered the ring to help. The next entrant was Jeff Hardy, and all three attacked The Undertaker, reigniting their previous rivalry with him. The Undertaker eventually eliminated them both. The Hardys returned, however, and continued their attack, but were thrown out again. This distraction allowed Maven, the following entrant, to eliminate The Undertaker. The Undertaker returned, beat down Maven, and eliminated him. The Undertaker then assaulted Scotty 2 Hotty during his entrance, and continued his attack on Maven into the crowd, and to the backstage area, including smashing his head into a popcorn machine. The match continued with Christian and Scotty 2 Hotty battling it out, and the ring began to fill with more wrestlers. \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, the nineteenth entrant, dominated upon his entrance, and eliminated all three of the remaining participants. While he waited for the next entrant, he brought Christian and Chuck, whom he had eliminated, back in, and beat them down. Austin then eliminated the next two entrants, leaving him as the only man in the ring. Triple H then made his official in-ring return from injury at No. 22, brawling with Austin. Mr. Perfect returned as the twenty-fifth entrant to a loud ovation. The Big Show, the twenty-seventh entrant, dominated upon entering, until Kane entered next. Kane eliminated The Big Show, before Kane was also eliminated by Austin and Kurt Angle, the twenty-sixth entrant. Rob Van Dam made his Royal Rumble debut by entering the ring at No. 29, taking down nearly everyone with a variety of high-flying moves, until Triple H delivered the Pedigree to him. Booker T, also making his Royal Rumble debut, entered at No. 30, and quickly eliminated Van Dam. He then performed the \"Spin-A-Roonie\", and was quickly eliminated from the Rumble after receiving a Stone Cold Stunner from Austin.\nThe final four remaining were Austin, Triple H, Angle and Perfect. Angle executed an Angle Slam on Triple H and three German suplexes on Austin. Austin then hit a low blow on Angle, but Perfect and Angle double-teamed him. Angle then eliminated Austin as he was trying to eliminate Perfect. Austin then pulled Perfect outside and attacked him, before Angle attacked Austin from behind. Back in the ring, Perfect and Angle attacked Triple H. Austin once again entered the ring and hit Perfect, Angle and Triple H with a steel chair before finally leaving. Angle attacked then Perfect with a clothesline by accident, and Perfect executed a Perfect-Plex on Angle out retaliation. Triple H then eliminated Perfect with a clothesline, leaving only Angle and Triple H as the final two. It went back and forth before Angle sent Triple H over the top rope with a back body drop, but Triple H held on. Angle thought he had won, and prematurely celebrated. Triple H took advantage, and executed a facebuster knee smash on Angle, followed by a clothesline over the top rope to win the Royal Rumble match.\nReception.\nIn 2011, Jack Bramma of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 7.5 [Good], writing, \"Despite the super hot crowd, this is a great rumble but only a good show altogether. The Rock-Jericho match is mildly disappointing knowing what they are capable of and the Flair-Vince match is nowhere near the level of even Vince’s best garbage matches. The Edge-Regal match is a good title match but easily missable. [Not] overwhelmingly outstanding, but still a solid recommendation.\"\nAftermath.\nAustin won a number one contender's match against Kurt Angle on the January 28 episode of \"Raw\" to earn a match for the Undisputed WWF Championship at No Way Out. A feud between Austin and Chris Jericho started with Jericho interfering in Austin's match by attacking him with his title belt.\nThe Undertaker continued his feud with Maven over the elimination during the Royal Rumble match, which grew to include The Rock after he mocked Undertaker for his quick elimination. The Undertaker's interference led to The Rock losing to Kurt Angle in the tournament to challenge for the Undisputed championship at No Way Out. On the February 4 episode of \"Raw\", during a tag team match, The Undertaker grabbed a steel lead pipe from his motorcycle and nailed The Rock in the head with it, allowing Chris Jericho to score the pinfall win. The Rock retaliated by hitting him with a chair and helping Maven win the WWF Hardcore Championship that Undertaker had won at Vengeance; however The Undertaker performed a Tombstone Piledriver on The Rock onto the hood of a limousine in revenge. A match was made between the two at No Way Out.\nKurt Angle started a feud with Triple H, unhappy about how he lost the Royal Rumble match, and attacked Triple H after a confrontation. During Triple H's match with Booker T, Angle interfered and attacked Triple H. Angle then had Vince McMahon make a match between the two at No Way Out for Triple H's title shot at WrestleMania X8. Triple H and his on-screen wife Stephanie McMahon were having problems, so she faked a pregnancy and demanded that they renew their wedding vows. Triple H discovered the truth, and ended their marriage. Stephanie McMahon then announced herself as the guest referee in the match at No Way Out.\nThe 2002 Royal Rumble was the last Royal Rumble held under the WWF name, as in May 2002, the promotion was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was also the last Royal Rumble until 2014 in which there was only one world championship for the Rumble winner to challenge for as in March 2002, the promotion introduced the first brand extension, which split the roster into two distinct brands, Raw and SmackDown!, where the wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. At first, the Undisputed Championship was available to both brands, but in September, it became exclusive to SmackDown! and renamed to WWE Championship after Raw introduced the World Heavyweight Championship as their top title. Additionally, King of the Ring was discontinued as a PPV following its 2002 event, thus the Royal Rumble, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, reverted to being called the \"Big Four\" until October 2021 when Money in the Bank was recognized as one of the \"Big Five\".\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.\n – Winner\n Undertaker assaulted and eliminated Maven following his own elimination by Maven.&lt;br&gt;\n This was Austin's 36th career elimination in the Royal Rumble, which was a record held for eight years until Shawn Michaels broke it in the 2010 Royal Rumble."

        "text": "The 2001 Royal Rumble was the 14th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 21, 2001, at the New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana. Six matches were contested, including one match for the \"Sunday Night Heat\" pre-show.\nAs has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2001 event, the winner received a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven. The main event was the 2001 Royal Rumble match, which Stone Cold Steve Austin won by last eliminating Kane, which was his third Rumble win, and is so far the only wrestler to win the Royal Rumble match three times. The match also included comedian Drew Carey as a participant. On the undercard, Kurt Angle retained the WWF Championship against Triple H, and Chris Jericho defeated Chris Benoit in a ladder match to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2001, the winner earned a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania X-Seven. The 2001 event was the 14th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 21, 2001, at the New Orleans Arena in New Orleans, Louisiana.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nAt the Royal Rumble was WWF Champion Kurt Angle defending his title against Triple H in a standard match. The build-up to the match began on the January 8 episode of \"Raw Is War\", when Angle defended the championship against Stone Cold Steve Austin, which ended in a no contest when Triple H interfered and ambushed Austin with a steel pipe. On the January 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Vince McMahon scheduled Angle to defend his title at the Royal Rumble against Triple H. Leading up to the event, both men spoke about the match, with Triple H claiming that Angle only held the championship because he allowed him to, and Angle denying this.\nAlso taking place at the event was a ladder match for the Intercontinental Championship, in which the champion, Chris Benoit, defended his title against Chris Jericho. In the match, the title belt was suspended above the ring from the ceiling, and the only method to win was to climb a ladder to retrieve the belt. Their feud started at WrestleMania 2000, when Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho challenged Kurt Angle with both his Intercontinental title and WWF European Championship on the line in a Two-fall triple threat match. During that match, both men pinned each other in one fall each to win the respective championship from Angle. Since that event, Benoit would hold three pay per view victories over Jericho culminating at SummerSlam in a two out of three falls match. On the January 4 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Benoit defended his title against Jericho in a standard match. During the match, Perry Saturn and Dean Malenko, Benoit's partners in the group The Radicalz, interfered by attacking Jericho, causing him to win the match by disqualification but not the championship. On the January 8 episode of \"Raw Is War\", Jericho teamed with The Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) against The Radicalz (Saturn, Malenko, and Benoit) in a six man tag team match, which Jericho won by pinning Benoit. On the January 11 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Jericho demanded a title match at the Royal Rumble. Benoit offered to give Jericho any type of match he wanted and Jericho chose a ladder match.\nEvent.\nBefore the pay-per-view event began, an episode of \"Sunday Night Heat\", one of the secondary television programs for WWF, was shown. Lo Down (D'Lo Brown and Chaz) defeated Kaientai (Taka Michinoku and Shoichi Funaki) in a tag team match, when Chaz pinned Funaki. Originally, the winning team was to send one of their members into the Royal Rumble match, but Drew Carey wound up being entered instead.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe pay-per-view event began with Edge &amp; Christian defending their WWF World Tag Team Championship against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand. D-Von pinned Edge after a 3D, resulting in The Dudley Boyz winning the WWF World Tag Team Championship.\nNext, Chris Benoit defended his Intercontinental Championship against Chris Jericho in a ladder match, which was to serve as the blowoff to their longstanding on-and-off rivalry. Both men performed a number of attacks and maneuvers on one another in an attempt to disable their opponent long enough to climb the ladder and retrieve the title belt suspended above the ring. At one point in the match, Benoit dove through the ropes headfirst at Jericho, but Jericho struck him in the face with a steel chair. Jericho also applied the Walls of Jericho at the top of the ladder onto Benoit. The end of the match came when Jericho pushed over the ladder while Benoit was ascending it, causing Benoit to fall out to the outside of the ring. Jericho then climbed the ladder and retrieved the Intercontinental Championship belt.\nIn the third contest, Ivory defended the WWF Women's Championship against Chyna. Both women attempted to gain an advantage over the other, with Chyna controlling much of the match. The end of the match came when Chyna attempted a handspring back elbow on Ivory, who was in the corner of the ring. Chyna, however, fell to the canvas and (in storyline) injured her neck. Ivory then covered her for a successful pinfall, retaining her championship. Following this, commentator Jerry Lawler went into the ring to check on Chyna, and she was removed from the ringside area on a stretcher.\nMain event matches.\nNext, WWF Champion Kurt Angle defended the title against Triple H, who had been named number-one contender by his (then storyline) father-in-law Vince McMahon. The match began as a mat based, hold for hold contest, but Trish Stratus then tried to interfere on Angle's behalf, only to then get into a catfight with Stephanie McMahon, who was in Triple H's corner. Stratus (Vince McMahon's storyline mistress) and Stephanie (McMahon's daughter and then storyline wife of Triple H) had been involved in their own feud due to vying for power as the WWF's \"dominant female\". After the fracas involving the two ladies on the outside (which had to be broken up by Vince himself), both Triple H and Angle accidentally hit the referee Earl Hebner, causing him to roll out of the ring. Triple H grabbed the title belt and tried to hit Angle with it, only to receive a belly-to-belly suplex. Angle then tried to hit Triple H with the belt, but Triple H ducked and gave him a Pedigree. As Triple H went outside to revive the referee, Stone Cold Steve Austin attacked Triple H and performed the Stone Cold Stunner on him as retaliation for Triple H costing Austin the title several weeks earlier on \"Raw Is War\". As Austin left the arena, Angle crawled over on top of Triple H to cover him for the pin, while Hebner recovered and made the count. Angle won the match and retained the WWF Title, with a very angry Triple H vowing to get even with Austin for costing him the match.\nClosing the show was the traditional 30-man Royal Rumble match for a WWF Championship match at WrestleMania X-Seven. The first two entrants were Jeff Hardy and Bull Buchanan, a member of Right To Censor at the time. They were joined by Matt Hardy who entered at No. 3, both Hardys worked together in eliminating Buchanan as well as Faarooq who entered at No. 4. Jeff and Matt then battled each other, and it was during this time that Drew Carey arrived at No. 5, being the first celebrity entrant in Rumble history.\nEarlier in the night, Carey was backstage looking to speak with Vince McMahon about how to put together a successful pay-per-view. After thinking Carey was trying to hit on his (storyline) mistress Trish Stratus, McMahon offered Carey a spot in the Rumble (in hopes of Carey getting pummeled) as a way to promote his upcoming \"Improv All-Stars\" pay per view. Once Carey entered the ring, he stood aside, and watched as the Hardys eliminated each other. Kane then entered at No. 6. Carey tried to shake his hand as well as bribe him with cash, but Kane grabbed Carey by the throat and was about to chokeslam him when Hardcore Champion Raven entered the ring at No. 7, and attacked Kane with a Singapore cane. This gave Carey the opportunity to eliminate himself safely by climbing over the top rope (this appearance would 10 years later lead to Carey being inducted in the \"celebrity wing\" of the WWE Hall of Fame).\nNo. 8, Al Snow came out before the clock went off and attacked Raven. He tried to get in the ring, but the referees stopped him until the buzzer went off. Kane would then dominate the match, eliminating all of the wrestlers who came between No. 7 to 11. The Honky Tonk Man (who had not appeared in the WWF since the 1998 Royal Rumble) came in at No. 12 and started singing his entrance theme \"Cool, Cocky, Bad\", only to be greeted by a guitar shot to the head by Kane and eliminated immediately after. The Rock entered at No. 13 and started brawling with Kane. The ring began to fill up in the next few minutes, and the tide turned when the Big Show made his return from months of inactivity, entering at No. 23. He eliminated Test and K-Kwik, then proceeded to chokeslam everyone else. When he got to The Rock, Show received a low blow and was clotheslined over the top rope by The Rock. As Crash Holly made his way to the ring at No. 24, an irate Big Show dragged Rock under the bottom rope and chokeslammed him through the broadcast table. Just when the other wrestlers worked together in trying to eliminate Kane, The Undertaker made his arrival at No. 25 and saved Kane, and both of them eliminated everyone in the ring except The Rock (who was still unconscious due to Big Show's assault on him). Scotty 2 Hotty entered the ring at No. 26 and was quickly beaten up and eliminated by both Kane and Undertaker. Stone Cold Steve Austin entered at No. 27, but before he could enter the ring, he was assaulted and bloodied by Triple H who retaliated against Austin for costing him the match with Kurt Angle earlier. The Rock rolled back into the ring and battled with both The Undertaker and Kane. Billy Gunn, Haku (who was a surprise entrant after making his return from WCW) and Rikishi made up the last 3 entrants. Austin would actually be the last wrestler to enter the ring as he had just recovered and was coming to the ring at the same time as Rikishi, the 30th entrant.\nOnce everybody had entered the ring, Austin eliminated Haku, and Rikishi superkicked the Undertaker, eliminating him. Rikishi then attempted a Banzai Drop on The Rock, but The Rock recovered quickly, giving Rikishi a low blow and causing him to fall over the top rope.\nThe final four consisted of Kane, The Rock, Austin and Gunn. Gunn executed the Fame Asser on Austin, but Austin recovered quickly and eliminated Gunn. The Rock and Austin then battled each other after tossing Kane through (but not over) the ropes. Kane came back in moments later and tried to eliminate both Rock and Austin, who were fighting near the ropes. The Rock was eliminated, while Austin held on to the ropes. After a minute or so of fighting Austin, Kane went outside the ring, grabbed a steel chair and tried to use it to hit Austin. Austin avoided the chair shot and executed a Stunner on Kane. As Kane got up, Austin hit him in the head three times with the chair and then clotheslined him over the top rope to win the Rumble for a record third time.\nReception.\nIn 2017, Kevin Pantoja of \"411Mania\" gave the event a rating of 9.5 [Amazing], writing, \"The best Royal Rumble Pay-Per-View in history and one of the best PPVs in history period. The only thing on the show that keeps it from the perfect score was the garbage Women’s Title stuff. Everything else more than delivered. The WWF Title and WWF Tag Team Title matches were both really good and worked very well. The Royal Rumble match itself is one of the best Rumbles of all-time. Jericho vs. Benoit steals the show though. It is the best singles ladder match I've ever seen. This is just a tremendous event\".\nAftermath.\nBefore his title match at WrestleMania X-Seven, Stone Cold Steve Austin would try to get revenge on Triple H for attacking him at the pay per view. The two would face off in a Three Stages of Hell match in No Way Out 2001 which Triple H won. On the same show, Stephanie McMahon would face Trish Stratus and The Rock would defeat Kurt Angle for the WWF Championship. The Rock and Austin would face at WrestleMania. Austin would win the match with help from his arch-nemesis Mr. McMahon and begin a heel turn.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.\n – Winner\nKane eliminated 11 men, breaking the record for the most wrestlers eliminated in a single Royal Rumble. This record was previously held by Hulk Hogan (1989) and Stone Cold Steve Austin (1997), who both scored 10 eliminations respectively."

        "text": "The 2000 Royal Rumble was the 13th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event and 100th PPV overall produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 23, 2000, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York. Six matches were contested on the event's card.\nAs has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2000 event, the winner received a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 2000. The main event was the 2000 Royal Rumble match, which The Rock won by last eliminating Big Show. The undercard included a street fight match between Triple H and Cactus Jack for the WWF Championship which Triple H won to retain the title.\nThis Royal Rumble was the first WWF pay-per-view event to air on terrestrial television in the United Kingdom, as Channel 4 had acquired the rights to broadcast World Wrestling Federation programming that year. The Royal Rumble aired live, with commercial breaks—a format that was changed for later PPVs on Channel 4. The event has been named as one of \"the 15 best pay-per-views ever\" by WWE, with the Street Fight match being critically acclaimed among various reviewers.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2000, the winner earned a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 2000. The 2000 event was the 13th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 23, 2000, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, New York.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown!\".\nWWF Championship.\nThe main feud going into the event was between Triple H and Mick Foley. At Armageddon the previous month, Stephanie McMahon turned on her father Vince during his match with Triple H, with whom he had been feuding and who (in storyline) had married Stephanie against her will in a drive-through wedding. Vince and his son, Shane McMahon, left the company the next night out of anger. This left Stephanie, who began referring to herself as Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley, in control and she and her husband formed the McMahon-Helmsley Era with Road Dogg, Billy Gunn, and X-Pac, where they set out to make life miserable for all of their enemies in the WWF.\nTwo of the biggest targets of the group were The Rock 'N' Sock Connection, the team of Mankind (Foley) and The Rock. Mankind was one of the most vocal of the objectors to what Triple H and Stephanie were doing, and in the December 27, 1999, episode of \"Raw is War\", Triple H decided that the company was “not big enough” for the three of them and forced Mankind and Rock to face each other in a Pink Slip on a Pole match later that evening. Rock won the match, which meant that Mankind was fired from the company. Triple H then began featuring a Mankind impersonator (Dennis Knight) in an attempt to mock him; Foley would eventually confront and beat up the impostor on \"SmackDown!\" on January 6, 2000.\nOn the January 10 episode of \"Raw is War\", The Rock brought every superstar to the ring, demanding that Foley be reinstated or the entire roster would walk out. Triple H, who had defeated The Big Show to regain the WWF Championship the week before, acquiesced and reinstated Foley, who promptly requested a Street Fight for the WWF Championship at Royal Rumble. Foley and Triple H fought in a four-on-four tag team match later that night. Triple H pinned Foley after using the ring bell, and delivering two Pedigrees. After the match, Foley took off his mask and attacked Triple H.\nOn the January 13 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Triple H called out Foley again only to have the Mankind impersonator come out instead. When Foley did come out moments later, he revealed to Triple H that he had been thinking about what Mankind was and declared that “Mankind” was not ready to face him for the title at the Royal Rumble. Instead, he said the fans deserved a substitute; he then took off his mask and shirt and tie to reveal a black “Wanted Dead” shirt underneath and revealed to Triple H that, instead of taking on Mankind, he would be facing instead the much more brutal and violent Cactus Jack.\nRoyal Rumble Match/Rock vs. Big Show.\nBuildup towards the Royal Rumble match began on January 10, when The Rock announced his participation in the match and a week later guaranteed victory. The Big Show, who had lost the WWF Championship the week before, also declared his intention to win the match.\nBad blood had begun to spread between the two several days earlier on \"SmackDown!\" when the two were involved in a tag team match where Big Show abandoned The Rock after claiming he did not think much of him. Later that night, Rock and Big Show faced the New Age Outlaws. At the end, Big Show attacked The Rock, who then hit Big Show with a steel chair, and a People's Elbow. On the January 20 episode of \"SmackDown!\", a confrontation between The Big Show and The Rock was interrupted by Tori, who declared Kane the favorite, leading to a Triple Threat Over-the-Top-Rope Lumberjack match. In the match, the Big Show eliminated The Rock with a chokeslam, and Kane eliminated The Big Show with a back body drop to win, sparking a fight involving all the competitors and lumberjacks.\nIntercontinental Championship.\nAnother feud going into the event was between Chris Jericho, Chyna and Hardcore Holly over the WWF Intercontinental Championship. Chyna and Jericho had been feuding over the Intercontinental Championship for some time. After Chyna defeated Jeff Jarrett to win the title at No Mercy in October 1999, Jericho began challenging her for it. After coming up short at Survivor Series, Jericho dethroned Chyna at Armageddon. Chyna then began randomly assisting Jericho in his title defenses, claiming that she wanted to ensure he remained champion so she could take the title back from him.\nOn the December 30 episode of \"SmackDown!\" Chyna and Jericho wrestled a match that ended in a double pin. Instead of declaring the match a draw and keeping the belt with Jericho, Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley declared Jericho and Chyna to be co-Intercontinental Champions. This meant that both Chyna and Jericho would defend the belt, albeit separately, and if one of them lost a title defense both of them lost the title.\nSince neither Chyna nor Jericho wanted to be the one to lose the title, both wrestlers began interfering in each other's matches to make sure they held onto the Intercontinental Championship until a match to settle the dispute could be signed. This ended up drawing Hardcore Holly into the mix, as he challenged both wrestlers for the title only to come up short each time. Holly eventually challenged the co-champions to a match at the Royal Rumble, and a triple threat title match was signed.\nEvent.\nSunday Night Heat.\nThe pay-per-view was preceded by an episode of Sunday Night Heat, which aired live on USA Network and included backstage interviews from Madison Square Garden as well as several participants drawing their entry numbers for the Royal Rumble match. An upset Kaientai and The Mean Street Posse were shown backstage not being able to draw numbers because they were denied entry into the Rumble match. The Big Show also did a live in-ring promo talking about his entry in the Rumble match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match of the event was between Kurt Angle and an unannounced opponent. Before the match, Angle spoke to the audience, putting down the New York Knicks, and his opponent. Tazz then made his WWF debut as Angle's opponent. Tazz gained the early advantage, performing a back body drop, sending Angle outside the ring. Angle gained the advantage after performing a vertical suplex outside the ring. After performing a belly to belly suplex, Angle climbed the turnbuckles, but Tazz hit the ropes. Angle fell onto the top turnbuckle, and Tazz performed a belly to belly suplex off the turnbuckles. Angle regained the advantage after a small package, and a bridging German suplex. Tazz then countered an Olympic slam into a German suplex. After a T-Bone suplex and a Head and arm suplex, Tazz applied the Tazzmission. Angle passed out and Tazz won the match, ending Angle's undefeated streak.\nThe second match was WWF's first-ever Tag Team Tables match, between the Hardy Boyz (Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy) and the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley). Before the match, the Dudley Boyz set up their heel status and insulted the fans (which ironically, the Dudley Boyz are both from New York City), expressing their dislike for the booing of John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves closer, which had defeated the hometown New York Mets 4–2 in the National League Championship Series two months earlier and trashed New York City and its people in what was a heated second-round playoff series. This Tables match was different in that instead of one person having to go through a table to win the match, both members from the same team had to go through a table. The Hardy Boyz gained the advantage with a double superplex to Bubba Ray, and the use of a ladder. After using the chair, Matt placed Bubba Ray on a table outside the ring. Matt then performed a diving leg drop as Jeff performed a diving splash (known as the Event Omega) on Bubba Ray through the table. The Hardy Boyz then placed D-Von on a table outside the ring. Matt attempted a diving leg drop through the table, but D-Von avoided it. Jeff then attempted a suicide senton, but missed, sending himself into a table. Bubba Ray performed a superbomb through a table on Matt. The Dudley Boyz then beat down the Hardy Boyz, and stacked tables in the entrance way under a balcony in the seating area. Bubba Ray dragged Jeff to the balcony, but Jeff performed a low blow, and used a chair on Bubba Ray. Matt moved as Bubba Ray fell through the tables. Matt then placed D-Von onto a table, and Jeff sent him through it with a Swanton Bomb from the balcony for the Hardy Boyz to win the match, which ultimately turned out to be a violent and brutal affair- it featured no less than twelve total steel chair shots to the head, including four to Bubba Ray Dudley.\nNext was the Miss Rumble 2000 swimsuit contest. The contestants were Ivory, Terri, Jacqueline, Barbara Bush, Luna Vachon, and The Kat, while the judges consisted of comedian Andy Richter and WWF alumni Sgt. Slaughter, Tony Garea, Johnny Valiant, Freddie Blassie, and The Fabulous Moolah. The contestants showed their swimsuits, though Luna refused to take off her coat. As the judges were deciding, Mae Young appeared, and announced her participation in the contest. After showing her swimsuit, she flashed her breasts. The video was censored before Mark Henry covered her up. The judges then unanimously decided Young as the winner, unfortunately Young's actions would end up costing the WWF their deal with Channel 4 in the UK.\nThe third match was a Triple Threat match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship between Hardcore Holly, and co-champions Chris Jericho and Chyna. Before the match, Jericho declared his plans for a celebration after winning the match. The match went back and forth before Holly sent Chyna outside the ring. Jericho then fought with Holly, applying the Walls of Jericho. Chyna returned to the ring, and attacked Jericho. Jericho performed a springboard splash to Holly outside the ring. Back in the ring, Chyna performed a handspring back elbow, and a DDT to Jericho. Chyna attempted a pin, but Holly returned and threw her out of the ring. All three were outside the ring, and Holly attempted to use a chair, but Chyna performed a dropkick to the chair into Holly's face. In the ring, Chyna performed a diving splash onto Holly, and Jericho performed a diving splash onto both of them. Chyna countered a belly to back suplex, and performed a low blow to Jericho. Chyna then performed a Pedigree to Holly. Jericho performed a diving crossbody to Chyna, who was on Holly's shoulders. Chyna performed a superplex to Holly, hit him with a chair, and applied the Walls of Jericho. Jericho then performed a one-handed bulldog, and a Lionsault to Chyna, to pin her for the victory. Jericho gained sole possession of the title as a result.\nThe fourth match was between the New Age Outlaws (Road Dogg and Billy Gunn) and The Acolytes (Faarooq and Bradshaw) for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Before the match, the New Age Outlaws delivered their signature speech to the audience. The Acolytes gained the early advantage after a fallaway slam from Bradshaw to Gunn. After avoiding an attack in the corner, Bradshaw performed the Clothesline from Hell on Gunn. Faarooq then executed a spinebuster on Dogg. As Faarooq attempted a pin, Gunn pulled the referee outside the ring, and Bradshaw knocked down both Gunn and the referee. After The Acolytes performed an aided powerbomb on Dogg, X-Pac came down to interfere, and performed a spinning heel kick on Bradshaw. Gunn then pinned Bradshaw after a Fameasser to retain the title.\nThe fifth match was between Triple H and Cactus Jack in a violent and brutal Street Fight for the WWF Championship. Jack gained the early advantage after repeated punches, and they fought outside the ring, where Triple H hit Jack with the ring bell. Triple H then hit Jack with a chair, but Jack got up, and performed a leg drop with the chair. The fight continued into the audience, with Jack performing a suplex onto pallets, and using a trash can. Triple H performed a belly to back suplex, but Jack came back with a running knee lift into the steel steps. Jack attempted to use a barbed wire two-by-four, but Triple H performed a low blow, and used the weapon on Jack. Jack came back, hit Triple H's groin with the weapon, and performed a double arm DDT. Jack attacked Triple H's head repeatedly with the weapon. Jack attempted a back to belly piledriver through the announce table, but Triple H countered with a back body drop. Jack countered a Pedigree attempt and performed a bulldog onto the two-by-four. Triple H performed a hip toss into the steps, and targeted Jack's knees, using the two-by-four. Triple H then handcuffed Jack but as he tried to use the steel steps, Jack performed a drop toe hold, sending Triple H's head into the steps. Triple H came back by using the chair. The Rock came out, and struck Triple H with a chair, as a police officer removed Jack's handcuffs. Jack performed a pulling Texas piledriver on the announce table, and spilled a bag of thumbtacks in the ring. Triple H came back with a back body drop onto the thumbtacks, and a Pedigree for a near-fall. Frustrated, Triple H finally hit Jack with a brutal second Pedigree onto the thumbtacks to win, and retain his title. After the match, Triple H was lifted onto a stretcher but Jack caught up to the emergency staff as they left the ringside area, pushed Triple H on the stretcher back to the ring, and hit Triple H with the two-by-four again.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the Royal Rumble match. During the match, non-participants Kaientai (Funaki and Taka Michinoku) repeatedly and randomly entered the ring, and attacked the participants. They were thrown out soon after each time. Rikishi, the fifth entrant, dominated upon entering, and eliminated all except Grand Master Sexay. Scotty 2 Hotty entered next, and the three Too Cool members danced in the ring until Rikishi eliminated the other two, and continued to dance. Rikishi eliminated the first to eighth entrants. The Big Boss Man, the ninth entrant, refused to enter the ring until Test, the following entrant, threw him in. During Kaientai's second interference, Taka was injured when he was thrown out of the ring, and sent to the hospital. Funaki continued to interfere by himself. Bob Backlund made a surprise return at number 14. It took six men to eliminate Rikishi. Chris Jericho entered at number 15 and eliminated Backlund before leaving through the crowd. Chyna entered at number 17 and eliminated Jericho before being eliminated by Boss Man not long after. After Faarooq, the eighteenth entrant, entered, non-participants Mean Street Posse came out, and attacked Faarooq, helping The Big Boss Man eliminate him. Bradshaw, entering twenty-seventh, was attacked by the Mean Street Posse, and eliminated soon after. Faarooq came out and, with Bradshaw, fought with the Mean Street Posse backstage.\nThe final four participants in the Royal Rumble match were The Rock, The Big Show, Kane, and X-Pac. The New Age Outlaws pulled Kane out of the ring, and attacked him. The Rock eliminated X-Pac, but the referees were preoccupied with Kane and did not see this. X-Pac re-entered the match. Kane hit an enzuigiri, and a scoop slam on The Big Show, but X-Pac then eliminated Kane with a spinning heel kick. X-Pac hit The Big Show with a Bronco buster, but The Big Show eliminated him with a gorilla press drop, leaving The Rock and The Big Show. The Rock performed a spinebuster and a People's Elbow, but The Big show came back with a chokeslam. The Big Show had The Rock on his shoulder, and attempted to throw him over the top rope, but The Rock hung onto the rope, and pulled The Big Show over. The Rock won the match.\nReception.\nIn 2011, Jack Bramma of 411Mania gave the event a rating of 8.0 [Very Good], writing, \"Easy, easy thumbs up. Triple H-Cactus Jack is a hardcore match with some psychology and tells an awesome story. One of the best brawls you'll ever see. The tables match is a frenzied melee and one of my favorite 10 minute matches ever. Taz's debut and the raucous ovation from the crowd and the rest is good enough to keep up. But please for the love of God, don't watch the Miss Rumble pageant\".\nAftermath.\nTriple H and Cactus Jack's feud continued into No Way Out, the following pay-per-view. On the January 31 episode of \"Raw is War\", Jack fought Triple H in a match where Mick Foley beat Triple H down. The following week, Triple H, in an attempt to end their feud, made a match between the two for the WWF Championship at No Way Out, but Foley would have to retire if he lost. Jack then decided that the match would be a Hell in a Cell match.\nEight days after the Royal Rumble, the \"Radicalz\" (Chris Benoit, Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, and Dean Malenko) arrived in the WWF from WCW, supposedly brought in by Cactus Jack, then the following week on \"Raw Is War\", they all turned on Jack when it was revealed that Triple H was the one that signed them to WWF contracts. They would make their PPV debut at \"No Way Out\" wrestling as a three-man team (Eddie Guerrero was injured and unable to wrestle).\nThe feud between Big Show and The Rock, which was in its infancy at the time, kicked into high gear after the finish to the Royal Rumble match. While the television cameras never actually showed this to the viewing audience, the sequence where Rock used Big Show's momentum to eliminate the big man and pull himself back into the ring ended with Rock accidentally touching the floor with both feet before Big Show's feet hit. The unintentional botched move was worked into the feud, where Big Show began claiming Rock had touched first and that he had indisputable video evidence of his victory (which consisted of a shot from a different camera filming the side of the ring where the elimination took place, and which clearly proved Big Show's statement). Once the evidence was shown to Triple H, Big Show received a match with Rock at No Way Out for the WrestleMania championship shot. Sixteen years later, the Rock made a special return to Monday Night Raw and ran into the Big Show backstage; after bringing up the 2000 Royal Rumble match, the Rock admitted that the Big Show legitimately should have been declared the winner.\nThe feud between Chris Jericho, Chyna and Hardcore Holly ended when Holly failed to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Jericho, and Chyna aligned herself with Jericho, who moved on to feud with Kurt Angle. Angle won the WWF European Championship on the February 10 episode of \"SmackDown!\", and on the February 14 episode of \"Raw is War\", Angle challenged Jericho to a match for the WWF Intercontinental Championship at No Way Out.\nThe feud between the Hardy Boyz and the Dudley Boyz continued, with Edge and Christian joining the feud. While initially showing respect, the Dudley Boyz attacked the Hardy Boyz during their match on the January 24 episode of \"Raw is War\". On the January 27 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Edge and Christian supported the Hardy Boyz and fought the Dudley Boyz, who put Edge and Christian through a table. On the January 31 episode of \"Raw is War\", the Hardy Boyz put the Dudley Boyz through tables, and, later, the Dudley Boyz put the Hardy Boyz through three stacked tables. On the February 14 episode of \"Raw is War\", D-Von Dudley defeated Edge and Jeff Hardy to earn a shot at the WWF Tag Team Championship at No Way Out, starting their feud with the champions the New Age Outlaws. Also during the match, the Hardy Boyz had a confrontation with Edge and Christian, starting their feud. They would also have a match at No Way Out.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds.\n – Winner\nX-Pac was originally thrown out by The Rock. However, the referees were distracted by the Outlaws beating up Kane, so he got back in the ring. Big Show eliminated X-Pac later."

        "text": "The 1999 Royal Rumble (marketed as Royal Rumble: No Chance in Hell) was the 12th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 24, 1999, at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim in Anaheim, California. The tagline and subtitle of the event was taken from a promise by WWF Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mr. McMahon that the first entrant in the Royal Rumble, Stone Cold Steve Austin, had \"no chance in hell\" of winning the match. The theme song for the event, based on the phrase, would go on to become the entrance music for McMahon's stable The Corporation and later, just McMahon himself, which he used until his resignation in January 2024.\nAs has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 1999 event, the winner received a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XV. The main event of the card was the 1999 Royal Rumble match. The event centered on the continuing heated rivalry between Stone Cold Steve Austin and Mr. McMahon, with those men entering the Royal Rumble match at #1 and #2, respectively. Mr. McMahon won the match by last eliminating Austin. The penultimate match was for the WWF Championship and was an \"I Quit\" match between Mankind and The Rock, which is remembered both for its brutality and its place in the documentary film \"Beyond the Mat\"; The Rock defeated Mankind to win the title. Lower down on the card, the WWF Intercontinental Championship and WWF Women's Championship were both defended.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1999, the winner earned a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XV. The 1999 event was the 12th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 24, 1999, at the Arrowhead Pond of Anaheim in Anaheim, California.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television show, \"Raw\".\nThe overriding theme of the pay-per-view was centered on The Corporation and Mr. McMahon's attempts to enforce his notions of how a company should be run on the promotion. Since its inception the night after Survivor Series, the group had mainly come to blows with D-Generation X, the Undertaker's Ministry of Darkness and McMahon's nemesis Stone Cold Steve Austin.\nWhen Commissioner Shawn Michaels allied himself with The Corporation, one of the first things he did was to book the Tag Team Champions, Road Dogg and Billy Gunn, in a title defense against Corporate members Ken Shamrock and The Big Boss Man. Despite his interference at they managed to retain their titles but they were not so lucky on \"Raw is War\" on December 14. As the feud between DX and The Corporation intensified, the New Age Outlaws turned to singles wrestling as Road Dogg found himself caught up in the hardcore division and became Hardcore Champion on December 21. Meanwhile, as well as tensions from the tag team feuding, Billy Gunn gained the ire of Ken Shamrock when his sister Ryan appeared at ringside, only to have her sibling affection distracted when Gunn lived up to his nickname by flirtatiously mooning Ryan after Val Venis had already danced for her. Filled with his typical rage Shamrock put his Intercontinental Championship on the line for a chance to honor his notions of sibling protection.\nAfter a minor absence, Women's Champion Sable returned to Raw with an open invitation on December 28, but before the match a fan came into the ring, later identified as Tori to give her a rose. A masked wrestler identified as \"Spider Lady\" came to the ring for the match (a nod to The Fabulous Moolah's screwjob over Wendi Richter in the mid '80s) but it ended in a no-contest when she started whipping Sable with her belt. The masked woman was revealed to be Luna Vachon, who would go on to face Sable in a \"Strap Match\" at the Rumble.\nThe Rock and Mankind had been feuding ever since Survivor Series in November 1998, when the two met in the finals of the \"Deadly Game\" tournament for the vacant WWF Championship. The Rock won the title that night with the help of the McMahons, who had previously been assisting Mankind, and became the chosen Corporate Champion while Mankind began a feud with the Corporation. Mankind faced The Rock again at Rock Bottom: IYH and won the match, but Mr. McMahon stepped in and announced that while Rock lost the match by falling unconscious to the mandible claw with Mankind’s smelly sock in his mouth, he did not technically submit and thus the WWF Championship would not change hands. Angered at being screwed out of the championship twice, Mankind attacked Shane McMahon on Raw is War and demanded a match. On the first Raw is War of 1999, January 4, after interference from The Corporation, D-Generation X and Steve Austin, Mankind won his first WWF Championship. Initially he refused The Rock's demands for a rematch, despite Rock offering stipulation after stipulation to appease Mankind until eventually he quit begging, at which point Mankind revealed that he would face The Rock at the Rumble as long as it was an \"I Quit\" match.\nThe Royal Rumble match featured a number of notable build ups. On Raw is War on January 11, a Corporation vs. DX mini-Rumble was set up with the winner taking the coveted number 30 spot; after all the apparent competitors had entered it seemed as if Triple H had won until Mr. McMahon made his way to the ring, entering himself on behalf of the Corporation and throwing a distracted Triple H out of the ring. Again it seemed as if the winner was established until DX's Chyna made her way to the ring and won the match. The event would mark the first time a female wrestler took part in the match. Chyna also appeared at the Royal Rumble the following year as well. Chyna became the only woman to enter the match until Beth Phoenix entered the Royal Rumble in 2010, Kharma in 2012, and Nia Jax in 2019.\nThe most notable aspect of the Royal Rumble, though, was the feud between Mr. McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin. Austin had won the Royal Rumble the previous two years and McMahon attempted to prevent him from repeating by putting him in a \"Buried Alive\" match at Rock Bottom: IYH against The Undertaker with one Royal Rumble place on the line. Austin won, with a little help from Kane and was guaranteed a place in the match, but McMahon continued in his attempts to prevent Austin from winning the match by \"randomly\" drawing Austin's spot at #1 and entering himself in the match at #30. Commissioner Michaels over-rode his decision and put McMahon at #2, and set up the aforementioned Corporate/DX mini-Rumble for the now vacant #30 position. With Austin and McMahon being the first two to enter, McMahon wanted to guarantee there would be \"no chance in hell\" that Austin would win by not only training as a competitor, but also offering a $100,000 bounty for the man who eliminated him.\nQualifying matches.\n Shamrock jumped the top rope to attack Billy Gunn as he made his entrance.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe opening match began slowly, with Boss Man taunting Road Dogg and being met with a crotch chop. The two circled each other, occasionally going in for a grapple but without achieving a move. Eventually Road Dogg became trapped in the corner and Boss Man punched him. Road Dogg found some short success when Boss Man tried to run and jump onto him, but was left with his crotch caught on the ropes. Boss Man tried to reply with his night stick but referee Mike Chioda stopped him and while he was being reprimanded, Road Dogg dragged him to his feet and pulled him into the ring post, legs open. After recovering, Boss Man threw Road Dogg outside of the ring. Inside the ring Boss Man took to hurling his opponent into the turnbuckles and then crushing him with a bear hug. Despite some punching back from Road Dogg, Boss Man dominated most of the match from this point and despite a Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll from Road Dogg, Boss Man used his opponent's momentum to catch him in the Boss Man Slam, pinning him afterwards.\nWith Billy Gunn in the ring, Ken Shamrock ran into a series of kicks but managed to get to his feet and punch Gunn into the corner. He quickly worked on slowing down Gunn's style, keeping him mostly grounded with a series of kicks and elbow drops, only picking Gunn up to kick him back down. Both men went down after Shamrock Irish-whipped him and tried to flapjack Gunn, only to have his face driven into the mat with a FameAsser. Although Gunn put Shamrock in the corner for a ten punch, he then went to run into him and was thrown over the top rope out of the ring. Shamrock took advantage of the time outside of the ring to drag Gunn around, throwing him face first into the ring post, steel steps and the unpadded floor before putting him back in the ring. When the two were on the apron, Gunn managed to stun Shamrock by elbowing him and jumping into a bulldog onto the Spanish announce table. Taking some time to recuperate, Shamrock was undeterred, fighting as soon as he returned to the ring as he began to work on Gunn's ankle. Gunn fought back but accidentally clotheslined referee Tim White and while he was down, Val Venis ran in and delivered a DDT on Shamrock. By the time White was conscious to make a pin count, Shamrock kicked out. Gunn gained momentum and eventually went for a move from the turnbuckle. When he came down, Shamrock caught his ankle and took him to the ground, using his ankle lock to make Gunn submit.\nThe European Championship match started with X-Pac running roughshod over Gangrel using a variety of spinning kicks. Gangrel's short advantage came from throwing X-Pac onto the ropes but X-Pac would not be kept down, trying a Bronco Buster. X-Pac tried to go to the top rope, fighting Gangrel from it, and then going for a flying crossbody. Some controversy arose when referee Teddy Long seemed to make the three count as Gangrel rolled the diving X-Pac into a roll-up pin, the champion kicking out too late. The match continued, though, despite chants from fans in attendance about the pin fall, but only for a short while as X-Pac jumped and drove a running Gangrel's head into the floor for the X-Factor and pinning him.\nDespite Shane McMahon announcing Sable as unfit for contest, she came to the ring and demanded to fight, with McMahon joining the commentary team and giving a very biased account. After whipping Vachon with the strap, Sable was knocked to the ground allowing Vachon to tap two turnbuckles but Sable stopped her, using the strap again to whip her. After being kicked in the corner by Sable, Vachon side slammed Sable and then wrapped the strap around Sable's neck, hoisting Sable on her back. She then toured the turnbuckles, tapping three of them unaware that Sable was doing the same from her back. Just before she could tap the fourth, Vachon was taken off her feet by Sable. Fearing a turn in the match, Shane McMahon jumped on the apron to distract the referee, but as Vachon went to tap the fourth turnbuckle, Tori attacked her and ran back into the crowd, letting Sable freely tap the fourth turnbuckle in sight of the referee to retain the Women's Championship.\nWWF Championship match.\nThe \"I Quit\" Match began with Mankind clotheslining and punching Rock into the turnbuckle before putting him on the ground and punching him, trying to make him quit early on with no success. When The Rock insulted Mankind over the microphone, Mankind struck him with the microphone and then Cactus clotheslined him out of the ring. After punching Rock against the barricade, he was thrown over the steel steps but managed to take control once again when The Rock joined the commentary team to further mock Mankind and was clotheslined over the table. After hitting him again with the microphone when he would not quit, Rock was thrown inside the ring again, where Mankind stuffed a smelly sock down the Rock's throat to the point where Rock could not talk to quit, as the Rock had passed out from the mandible claw. Mankind then took Rock out of the ring and through the crowd but when he tried to clothesline Rock, Rock slammed him back into the ringside barricade. Rock then took the bell to Mankind's head, ringing it next to his ear (and humorously singing \"bells will be ringing\" into the microphone) before trying to Rock Bottom him through the Spanish announce table, but the table gave way before the move could be performed.\nMankind ran for recovery up the walkway but was chased by The Rock who lost control when his opponent began head-butting him. Rock thumbed Mankind's eye and took him through the technical area, smashing his head into the food there and then performing a DDT on him on the concrete, at which point Mankind refused to quit. Rock then brought a ladder into the match but was knocked down with the ladder on top of him, he escaped just as Mankind delivered a running elbow drop onto the ladder, though he would still not quit. Rock then set the ladder up and climbed to the first tier of crowd, fighting in front of them with Mankind just about to throw him off. Rock low blowed him though, and then climbed over the barrier up the stairs to make a running punch which launched Mankind onto the electrical hub of the arena, causing them to spark and the lights to go out briefly. Shane McMahon came to stop the match but Rock demanded his opponent quit, though he would not ask him the question as he kicked a crawling Mankind back towards the ring. With Mankind lying unconscious in the ring, Rock handcuffed his hands behind his back and hit his head into the turnbuckle. Mankind kicked the Rock low, then dropped a knee into his crotch and asked him if he quit. The Rock managed to stand up and clotheslined Mankind to the mat, putting a chair on his face and performing the Corporate Elbow. When he was asked if he would quit, Mankind told Rock to go to hell, Rock told him he'd go to hell first. Mankind stood up only to be met with three hard steel chair shots but still refused to quit, saying he'd have to be killed first. Rock then chased Mankind out of the ring and up the walkway, hitting him repeatedly with a chair until he fell unconscious on the concrete. Finally, Mankind was heard shouting \"I quit!\" three times in a row; the audio was actually a recording from a promo Mankind made on \"Heat\" in the match build up, so Mankind never actually quit, but the Rock was declared the winner nonetheless. Backstage footage of before and after this match can be seen on the pro wrestling documentary \"Beyond the Mat\".\nRoyal Rumble match.\nThe Royal Rumble match began with Steve Austin and Vince McMahon circling each other. McMahon mistimed a clothesline and Austin punched him into the corner, stomping a mudhole. Austin then went to throw McMahon over the top rope but stopped, wanting to take his time as Golga came to the ring. With Austin distracted by Golga, McMahon fled under the bottom rope (and thus wasn't eliminated) but Austin soon followed when Golga was eliminated. Austin followed McMahon through the crowd and eventually fought their way to the halls of the arena and was led into the public toilets where The Corporation were waiting to beat Austin down and leave him unconscious on the floor. In the ring Droz had come out and waited the allotted time until Edge made his appearance, the two fighting only to quickly eliminate Gillberg as soon as he entered the ring. When Dan Severn entered the ring he immediately gunned for the also freshman Steve Blackman, the two fighting in the corner until Tiger Ali Singh came in and attacked Blackman. Meanwhile, clips were shown of Austin being lifted onto a gurney and eventually being taken to hospital. Shortly after, The Blue Meanie entered the match and went after Singh, before being cornered by Droz. When the eleventh man was scheduled to enter, nobody showed and backstage Mabel was shown throwing Headbanger Mosh into a wall before entering the Rumble himself in Mosh's place. Shortly after entering the match, Mabel took out Blackman, Severn, Singh, Meanie and Droz, and started a clash with Road Dogg, who was just fresh and took Edge out, having the upper hand. But after having some dominance, the lights went out, and when they came back up, under a blue hue, The Acolytes and Mideon had eliminated Mabel and took him to meet The Undertaker who put him in a (kayfabe) trance. None of them were competitors. Road Dogg was left on his own and quickly eliminated Gangrel but had more difficulty with Kurrgan. Al Snow tried to help Road Dogg but when he over zealously climbed the ropes to push Kurrgan out, Road Dogg jumped on the opportunity to push him over. The ring gradually began to fill up again with Goldust and Godfather until Kane entered, instantly putting all four wrestlers over the top rope and then eliminating himself when some asylum workers came to try and commit him.\nMr. McMahon briefly returned into the ring but then exited to give the ring to Ken Shamrock, opting to join the commentary team instead. The next entrant was Billy Gunn, with only one shoe due to his ankle being injured from their earlier match up. As Test entered the ring, the Ministry were shown in the parking lot putting Mabel into a hearse and then an ambulance pulled up with Steve Austin driving. He quickly made his way to the ring, overshadowing the entrance of the Big Boss Man. McMahon ran around the ring away from Austin, running through it to allow Shamrock to secure him before fleeing again to the commentary team. Austin eliminated Shamrock with little trouble but put more effort into Boss Man, choking him with a turnbuckle tie. Again the ring began to fill up, with two members of DX in Triple H and X-Pac, Test and Boss Man representing The Corporation along with other singles wrestlers in Val Venis, Mark Henry, Jeff Jarrett, D'Lo Brown and Owen Hart. Austin took a break from being in the ring to go to the commentary team to throw a jug of water in McMahon's face before returning to the fight. At this point the first woman to enter a Royal Rumble, Chyna came to the ring. She instantly targeted Mark Henry, delivering forearms before throwing him over the top rope, but before she had time to celebrate Austin immediately clotheslined her over the top rope, for which Triple H attacked him, and in addition, this latter took both Val and Jarrett out. Triple H was soon eliminated by Austin as the numbers started to dwindle after Austin threw D'Lo and Owen over, and after giving a Stone Cold Stunner to Boss Man, Austin eliminated him leaving only him and McMahon. Austin went to the announce table and attacked McMahon, throwing him into the crowd and then back to ringside, hitting him with a chair. Austin then threw McMahon into the ring, standing over him as McMahon clambered to his feet and lowblowed Austin. The two both staggered to their feet when Austin stunnered McMahon. The Rock then came to ringside taunting Austin with the WWF Championship, climbing up to the apron. As Austin ran to punch Rock, McMahon climbed to his feet and came up behind Austin, throwing him over the top rope and winning the 1999 Royal Rumble match.\nReception.\nIn 2010, Jack Bramma of \"411Mania\" gave the event a rating of 6.5 [Average], stating, \"Hard to accurately judge. The undercard is mediocre. Rock-Foley [is] awesome, but as usual the show lives or dies with the Rumble match. The '99 Rumble match is definitely acquired taste, and if you weren’t a fan of the period, you will probably think it sucks. It's dated as hell and is a microcosm of the Attitude Era, but I loved the Rumble match itself warts and all and that's mostly what the rating is for (the Rumble and Rock-Foley). Your mileage will totally vary\".\nAftermath.\nOn \"Raw Is War\" the following night, Mr. McMahon awarded The Rock the $100,000 bounty for helping him eliminate Austin in the Royal Rumble, and also announced that he was officially forfeiting his title shot at WrestleMania, the first time ever a Royal Rumble winner had done so, so as to not make The Rock defend his WWF Championship against McMahon. While McMahon planned to choose who The Rock would face at WrestleMania, he was interrupted by WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels, who informed McMahon that since he forfeited his title shot at WrestleMania, according to WWF rules, the title shot was then immediately given to the Royal Rumble runner-up, Steve Austin, much to McMahon's fury. Austin took advantage by convincing McMahon to a match. Austin explained that even more than a WWF Championship match, he wanted another chance to fight McMahon without any legal ramifications so much that he would risk his WrestleMania title shot for the chance. To ensure that there would be no corporate interference, the match would take place inside a steel cage at . Austin went on to win the match after the debut of Paul Wight, who came through the ring's mat and threw Austin into the cage wall, breaking it open and causing Austin to exit the cage before McMahon. Austin proceeded to face The Rock at WrestleMania XV, winning the WWF Championship for the second year in a row.\nThe mystery of Mankind's quitting was solved when it was revealed that Shane McMahon had played a voice clip from a prerecorded interview on \"Sunday Night Heat\" of Mankind vowing to make Rock be the one screaming, \"I quit, I quit, I quit!\" when he was actually unconscious. Having been screwed again, Mankind hijacked the $100,000 bounty money The Rock earned for helping eliminate Austin, and began to throw it in the crowd, holding it ransom for a rematch. The rematch would be a twenty-minute time limit hardcore match, held in an empty arena during halftime of Super Bowl XXXIII on \"Halftime Heat\", where Mankind would win the title back by trapping Rock underneath a heavy payload on a forklift truck. With the Rock claiming it was an unfair win, the two faced each other again, and in hopes of finding a definitive champion the match was booked as a \"Last Man Standing\" match at St. Valentine's Day Massacre. It ended in a draw when both men were counted out, meaning they had to settle it again the next night on \"Raw is War\" in a ladder match which Rock won with help from Paul Wight. With WrestleMania so close, Mankind sought to settle the score with Rock by countlessly trying to become a second special guest referee in the WrestleMania main event, alongside Wight. Early in the WrestleMania card, Wight and Mankind fought for the referee position in a match which saw Wight disqualified for chokeslamming Mankind through a pair of steel folding chairs. Mankind was sent to the hospital for his injuries, but returned to officiate in the closing minutes of the match.\nAfter making herself properly known, Sable's stalker Tori would be humiliated with her, pretending to align herself with Luna Vachon only to help Sable give her a beat down. Tori soon realized how selfish Sable was, though and the two had a match for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania XV where Sable retained her title thanks to interference from Nicole Bass.\nMabel, meanwhile, was renamed Viscera and became the newest member of the Ministry of Darkness as it assembled its war against The Corporation and Mr. McMahon, making The Brood part of the stable too on February 1. The Undertaker would have a \"Hell in a Cell\" match against Big Boss Man at WrestleMania XV which ended with The Brood passing rope from the roof to hang Boss Man with. The feud between the two stables continued until they joined forces when it became apparent that the \"higher power\" The Undertaker was answering to was actually Mr. McMahon.\nOne day after her historic appearance in the Royal Rumble Match, Chyna turned heel by betraying Triple H and becoming the newest member of The Corporation. At St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the evil Chyna teamed with fellow Corporation member Kane in defeating Triple H and X-Pac. Chyna turned against Kane and reunited with Triple H at WrestleMania XV, but they would both help Shane McMahon defeat X-Pac later in the event, making Triple H a member of The Corporation.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds.\n – Winner\n No. 11 was originally drawn by Headbanger Mosh, who was attacked and replaced by Mabel on his way to the ring. Mideon, Faarooq, and Bradshaw (themselves not official entrants) eliminated Mabel and would indoctrinate him into the Ministry of Darkness as \"Viscera\" on the following \"Raw\"."

        "text": "The 1998 Royal Rumble was the 11th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 18, 1998, at the San Jose Arena in San Jose, California. Six matches were contested on the event's card. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 1998 event, the winner received a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XIV.\nThe main event was a casket match between Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker for the WWF Championship, which Michaels won to retain the title. The main match on the undercard was the 1998 Royal Rumble match, which Stone Cold Steve Austin won by lastly eliminating Rocky Maivia, thus becoming the third person to win two Royal Rumble matches, and back-to-back, after Hulk Hogan in 1990-91 and Shawn Michaels in 1995-96. Additionally, The Legion Of Doom (Hawk and Animal) defeated The New Age Outlaws (\"Road Dogg\" Jesse James and \"Badd Ass\" Billy Gunn) by disqualification therefore, not winning the WWF Tag Team Championship, and \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia defeated Ken Shamrock to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1998, the winner earned a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XIV. The 1998 event was the 11th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 18, 1998, at the San Jose Arena in San Jose, California.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television show, \"Raw\".\nIn the weeks leading up to the pay-per-view, Ken Shamrock had been facing various members of the Nation of Domination ahead of his booked match against Intercontinental Champion Rocky Maivia (The Rock), defeating Kama Mustafa and Faarooq with his ankle lock despite interference from other Nation members. The \"Raw is War\" before the Rumble saw Shamrock team up with Mark Henry against Maivia and D'Lo Brown, but just as Shamrock looked set to lock his submission on The Rock, Henry turned on him, joining the Nation in giving him a post-match beat down.\nAfter winning their first tag team title, the New Age Outlaws further humiliated the erstwhile champions, the Legion of Doom, by shaving one of Hawk's mohawks and, with the help of D-Generation X, powerbombed Animal through the announcer's table, damaging his back. Although he was advised not to compete by doctors, Animal rested through the first few weeks of the year while the Outlaws ran roughshod through the tag division before this pay-per-view.\nThe buildup to the Royal Rumble match itself focused almost entirely on Stone Cold Steve Austin. He declared that before the match he would be living by the motto \"Do unto others, before they do unto me\" interfering in matches regularly on \"Raw is War\", or appearing just as matches finished, delivering the stunner to anyone in sight as well leaving other wrestlers back stage buried under tables and chairs. In the final segment of the \"Raw\" preceding the event, all competitors of the Royal Rumble were in the ring, waiting to draw their number of entry when Austin ran in through the crowd and began to throw punches all over the ring, sparking a brawl between the various wrestlers feuding in the ring, and kicking the number generator out of the ring.\nThe main event for the WWF Championship was a rematch between champion Shawn Michaels and challenger The Undertaker. The feud had begun after SummerSlam the previous August after Michaels, who was the special referee in the match between then-champion Undertaker and Bret Hart, hit Undertaker with a chair meant for Hart and counted the pin to cost Undertaker the championship. The first match between the two came at the following month, a match that ended in a no contest due to outside interference from Michaels' D-Generation X cohorts, Triple H and Chyna. Michaels and Undertaker resumed the feud at in October 1997 in the first Hell in a Cell match which ended with the debut of Undertaker's (kayfabe) brother, Kane, giving Michaels the unfair win by delivering a tombstone piledriver on Undertaker, allowing the almost beaten Michaels to steal the match. To mock his opponent, Triple H and Chyna brought a casket to the ring only for Michaels to appear from inside and spray paint it in D-Generation X slogans. The following week, while Michaels was delivering a promo, the same casket appeared again but this time Undertaker appeared from inside, grabbing the champion by the throat and dragging him into the coffin. Undertaker made his full presence known the following week, interrupting an interview in which Michaels was claiming to introduce the newest DX member: Kane. Undertaker told his opponent to leave his family out of the feud, before attacking the stable and being outnumbered. Kane made a surprise appearance and helped Undertaker, fighting DX up to the ramp before turning and reaching his hand out in an Undertaker-like salute which his brother returned.\nEvent.\nThe opening match began with Goldust attacking Vader as he entered the ring. Vader soon recovered and threw Goldust into the turnbuckle before he eventually fell out of the ring where Vader also shoved Luna Vachon to the ground. After a suplex and a big splash, Goldust was dragged to the corner so Vader could attempt his Vader Bomb, but a low blow stopped him. Vader then attempted the move for the second time, only to have Luna jump on his back. Vader hit the move anyway, and scored the pin.\nWith Sunny as the special guest referee, a six-man tag match of lucha libre midget wrestling took place. The face team took most of the early advantage, tagging frequently while the heel team were regularly thrown under the bottom rope and replaced with a fresh member. Max Mini used Sunny to help him dropkick Battalion, Tarantula and then El Torito in order and then delivered a top rope hurricarana to Torito, and winning the match with a backslide pin.\nThe Intercontinental Championship bout began with an exchange of punches and a few kicks until Ken Shamrock mistimed a hurricarana, allowing Rocky Maivia to slam him down. After being kicked to the corner, Shamrock replied with a crossbody that only gained him a two-count, as did a fisherman suplex pin. Maivia took control by reversing an Irish whip into a DDT and then putting the challenger in a headlock. His next attempt at a DDT was reversed, however, into a powerslam prompting Nation members to storm the ring. With the referee distracted after Maivia'sNation of Domination teammate D'Lo Brown's foot gets stuck with the ropes, \"The Rock\" used brass knuckles to hit Shamrock and then disposed of the knuckleduster inside Shamrock's trunks. By the time the referee looked back to the ring, he could only make a two count and Shamrock pulled off a belly to belly suplex slam, winning the match. However, as Shamrock celebrated, Maivia appealed to Mike Chioda who, upon discovering the foreign object, reversed the decision and took the belt from a bemused Shamrock. Then, Chioda gave it back to Maivia, making him the winner via disqualification. A furious Shamrock attacked the referee for stripping him of the title.\nIn the tag team match, New Age Outlaws prematurely began by attacking Legion of Doom before the bell rang but the Legion quickly turned the match in their favor, chasing the Outlaws up the ramp as the champions tried to lose by count out. Still holding control, the Legion took turns on Road Dogg who eventually handcuffed Hawk to the corner outside the ring. Regardless, Animal successfully dominated both Road Dogg and Billy Gunn, powerslamming Gunn into a pin that was broken by a chair shot. The disqualification gave the victory to LOD while the New Age Outlaws retained the belts, double teaming Animal until Hawk broke free from the cuffs to save his partner.\nThe Royal Rumble began with Mick Foley's persona Cactus Jack as #1, bringing trash cans to the ring. The second contestant was Terry Funk's alter-ego Chainsaw Charlie who ran to the ring wielding his chainsaw before Cactus hit him with a chair and the two engaged in a hardcore battle briefly interrupted by Tom Brandi who they both eliminated over the top rope. As \"The Rock\" Rocky Maivia entered, he was met with a trash can over the head, being bundled out of the ring under the bottom rope briefly. As the ring filled up Cactus Jack went to clothesline Charlie over the top rope but inadvertently threw himself over and eliminated himself. Owen Hart came out #9 but before he was able to enter the ring, NWA North American Champion Jeff Jarrett and ally Jim Cornette attacked him. Soon after, at #16, Mick Foley returned to the ring in his Mankind gimmick, returning the favour by eliminating Chainsaw Charlie while Ken Shamrock and Maivia resumed their feud from earlier. Jarrett officially came out at #18 and was soon joined in the ring by Owen Hart, who ran out from the back and eliminated Jarrett. Hart himself was soon distracted by the non-competing Triple H, who hit him with a crutch as Chyna yanked him out. When the clock counted down to #22, no contestant appeared with Jerry Lawler on commentary attributing the number to Stone Cold Steve Austin, who had reportedly been taken out backstage by Ken Shamrock. By #23, the Nation of Domination had four members (Maivia, D'Lo Brown, Mark Henry and Kama Mustafa) in the ring although they seldom worked together. All fighting in the ring ceased when Austin's music played for #24 but, after a lengthy wait, Stone Cold appeared from behind and tossed out Marc Mero and 8-Ball. Savio Vega, who entered #26, was accompanied by the rest of Los Boricuas who went straight after Austin. Faarooq completed the Nation stable in the ring but went straight after teammate Maivia before Foley's third appearance as Dude Love. Soon only four men remained (Maivia, Austin, Dude Love and Faarooq) and Austin and Dude Love, former tag team partners, teamed up against the Nation members, until Austin turned on Dude, allowing Faarooq to clothesline him out of the match. When Faarooq then turned to Austin, Maivia tossed his teammate out of the ring leaving the former Intercontinental Champion against the current champion. Maivia survived almost being thrown out only to be stunnered and tossed out again.\nThe main event began with The Undertaker mostly controlling Shawn Michaels. After walking on the top rope, Undertaker rolled Michaels into the casket but Michaels' hand grabbing the ring apron stopped it from being shut. As Undertaker went to shut the casket, Michaels threw it open and dazed his opponent by throwing powder into his eyes, leaving him stunned. Despite a throat shot, Undertaker began to lose his dominance of the match as things moved outside of the ring, with Michaels delivering a piledriver on top of the steel steps, before fellow degenerate, Triple H, hit him with a crutch. Michaels, too, failed to close the coffin's lid on Undertaker, forcing the fight back into the ring where Shawn tried to submit his opponent, following with a high-flying elbow drop and Sweet Chin Music. So sure of the win, with Undertaker lying in the casket, Michaels chose instead to taunt Undertaker, giving a crotch-chop which Undertaker seized on, leading to a brief fight in the ring but going back into the casket when Undertaker missed a flying clothesline and his momentum caused him to tumble inside. Michaels climbed to the top rope and delivered an elbow drop into the casket and the two fought inside a closed coffin. After eventually climbing out, both made it back to the ring where Undertaker gave Shawn a chokeslam. He then dragged the champion to the ring apron and hit a jumping tombstone piledriver, depositing Michaels into the casket. Before Undertaker could close it, the New Age Outlaws and Los Boricuas ran in and collectively pummeled Undertaker until the lights went out in the arena. Kane's music played and the Big Red Monster single-handedly took out everyone in the ring. In the meantime Chyna and Triple H helped a visibly hurt Shawn Michaels out of the casket. Kane suddenly turned on Undertaker, punching him and chokeslamming him into the casket. Triple H and Chyna shut it, thus ending the match and allowing Michaels to retain his title.\nKane was not done, however, as Paul Bearer came to ringside and the two padlocked Undertaker inside the casket and rolled it to the top of the entrance ramp where Kane chopped holes in the casket with an axe, doused it with gasoline and set it on fire. After the show went off the air, with the casket still burning, Kane and Bearer left the arena while various emergency officials extinguished the fire and Commissioner Slaughter and others tried to break open the casket to free Undertaker. However, when the casket was opened, no one was inside. Undertaker's voice then was heard to say \"Kane, until our paths cross again, I shall never rest in peace!\"\nReception.\nIn 2010, Jack Bramma of \"411Mania\" gave the event a rating of 7.0 [Good], stating, \"Worth a look for historical purposes if nothing else. Rocky was clearly on his way to being a star, Austin wasn't quite yet the biggest name in the industry but was close, and Michaels' (sort of) career-ending injury. And oh yeah four quality matches\".\nIn 2019, Thomas Hall of \"Wrestling Rumors\" gave the event a rating of D, stating, \"Good main event aside, this was a REALLY dull show overall. 1998 would wind up being an awesome year, but this wasn't the best start to it in the world. We saw a lot of the relics of the bad times here, but Austin was coming and there was absolutely nothing WCW could do to stop him. This wasn't a good show at all, but it was a necessary evil to get us to the glory days\".\nIn 2022, John Canton of \"TJR Wrestling\" gave the event a rating of 6/10, stating, \"It was another average Royal Rumble event that was lacking in terms of great matches aside from the main event. When it comes to that Undertaker/Shawn match, while it was very good, it's not their most famous match or their best match. The other undercard matches were poor, so that hurt the card quite a bit. In addition to that, the Royal Rumble match was probably the most predictable Rumble ever with Steve Austin winning. Aside from a few fun moments, it wasn’t very interesting at all. The crowd was engaged most of the night, so that's a positive and I also felt like they built up the top WrestleMania matches pretty well. At least Mike Tyson botching his interview and saying \"Cold Stone\" made me laugh\".\nAftermath.\nBy winning the Royal Rumble match, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin won the right to face Shawn Michaels for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania XIV. Mike Tyson's presence in the director's box was revealed the following night to be because he was taking the role of special guest referee for the event. Following an altercation with Austin, however, he was changed to special enforcer and soon allied with D-Generation X. At WrestleMania, though, Tyson showed his true colors and stepped in when the referee was knocked down making the three-count for Austin which many see as the official genesis for the \"Attitude Era\" and WWF's resurging dominance over chief rivals World Championship Wrestling (WCW).\nDuring his match with The Undertaker, Shawn Michaels suffered a severe back injury when he took a back body drop off of the casket, landing on his tailbone on the casket's outer mid-section. He herniated two discs in his back and crushed a third, and the injury forced him to retire from wrestling after WrestleMania. As it transpired, during a one-off match with Triple H at the 2002 SummerSlam, he realized his back no longer hampered him and made a full-time return to wrestling. His back injury kept him out of all wrestling until the main event at WrestleMania, despite being billed on the card for the next PPV, . His last-minute replacement was Savio Vega, who appeared in the main event eight-man tag team match which saw a number of high-profile feuds converge on the road to WrestleMania.\nThe New Age Outlaws would go on to take part in the eight-man main event at No Way Out of Texas, sparring opposite Cactus Jack and Chainsaw Charlie ahead of their WrestleMania title match. Their alliance with Triple H in this match saw them join the newly formed DX Army the day after WrestleMania. Legion of Doom went on to suffer a series of losses, ending in another loss against the Outlaws on February 23 after which they had an in-ring brawl and announced the dissolution of their team. They reappeared in a modified form as LOD 2000 in the opening WrestleMania match with Sunny as their valet.\nRocky Maivia's feud with Ken Shamrock spilled out into a ten-man tag match between the Nation of Domination and Shamrock's team, teaming with Ahmed Johnson and the Disciples of Apocalypse. Shamrock won the match by pinning Rock and faced him at WrestleMania once again for the Intercontinental title. He originally won the match but would not release his ankle lock; thus, Shamrock was disqualified.\nThe Undertaker would not return to action until WrestleMania, where he defeated Kane in a singles match. The feud continued with an inferno match at in April. Two months later, the two entered a storyline where Undertaker was eventually revealed to be in cahoots with his brother, which concluded with Paul Bearer reuniting with Undertaker and turning on Kane which led to the formation of the Ministry of Darkness at the end of 1998. This also marked the last time he would face Michaels in a singles match until the two met at WrestleMania 25; he would wrestle Michaels once more at WrestleMania XXVI where he won a \"streak vs. career\" match, forcing Michaels to retire from wrestling for good.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds.\n – Winner\n Referee Jack Doan was inadvertently kicked by Phineas I. Godwinn during his elimination, resulting in the referee suffering a concussion.\n Triple H and Chyna were not entrants in the Royal Rumble Match; they arrived in the arena during Honky Tonk Man's entry and worked together to eliminate Owen. Owen then ran after both of them to the backstage area.\n Owen was unable to compete in the Rumble for a while as he was beaten up by Jeff Jarrett on the way to the ring; he joined in the Rumble later on after Jarrett's entry, taking his revenge on Jarrett and eliminating him.\n Skull never made it to the ring; he was attacked by Los Boricuas prior to the Royal Rumble match when they mistook him for Stone Cold Steve Austin.\n Mick Foley is the only competitor to enter the same Royal Rumble match 3 times under different personas."

        "text": "The 1997 Royal Rumble was the 10th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 19, 1997, from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 1997 event, the winner received a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13.\nThe main event saw Shawn Michaels defeat Sycho Sid to win the WWF Championship. The main match on the undercard was the 1997 Royal Rumble match, which Stone Cold Steve Austin won after last eliminating Bret Hart. Additionally, Vader defeated The Undertaker, and Hunter Hearst Helmsley defeated Goldust to retain the WWF Intercontinental Championship.\nThe attendance of 60,477 is the highest recorded live crowd in the Royal Rumble's history with the 2017 edition of the event held at the same venue being the second largest. In addition to hometown hero Shawn Michaels going for the WWF championship, the WWF was working with the Mexico based Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA) promotion, and had several wrestlers from that company participate in the Royal Rumble match, as well as in a number of undercard matches.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1997, the winner earned a match for the WWF Championship at WrestleMania 13. The 1997 event was the 10th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 19, 1997, from the Alamodome in San Antonio, Texas.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised six matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television show, \"Raw\".\nThe feud between Goldust and Hunter Hearst Helmsley centered around Goldust's manager, Marlena. During the free broadcast prior to , Helmsley attempted to seduce Marlena. Goldust responded by attacking Helmsley during matches in the following weeks. The feud escalated on the December 30, 1996, episode of \"Raw\" during a match between Goldust and Jerry Lawler. Helmsley came to the ring and tried to carry Marlena away. Marc Mero, who had dropped the WWF Intercontinental Championship to Helmsley, blocked Helmsley's path, but the distraction was enough to cause Goldust to be counted out.\nOn July 22, 1996, Faarooq Asad made his WWF debut by attacking Ahmed Johnson, the Intercontinental champion. He claimed that he attacked Johnson because Johnson was not \"from the streets\", as Faarooq claimed to be. Soon after the attack, Johnson was diagnosed with a legitimate kidney problem, so the WWF claimed that Faarooq's attack had hospitalized Johnson. Johnson was unable to compete for several months and was forced to vacate the Intercontinental Championship. When Johnson returned to the WWF, he interfered in several matches involving Faarooq's stable, the Nation of Domination. He attacked them with a two-by-four, which led to an angle in which Johnson was suspended for the attacks. By December, Johnson's injury had recovered sufficiently to allow him to resume wrestling, and a match was scheduled for the next pay-per-view, the Royal Rumble.\nVader and The Undertaker did not have a substantial buildup to their match at Royal Rumble 1997. Vader had joined other heel wrestlers to attack The Undertaker on several occasions, but there was no major storyline behind their match. The Undertaker had been involved in a feud with Paul Bearer that dated back to SummerSlam 1996, when Bearer had turned on The Undertaker. On the January 5, 1997 episode of \"WWF Superstars\", The Undertaker attacked Vader's manager, Jim Cornette, leaving Vader without a manager at the Royal Rumble.\nThe feud between Sid and Shawn Michaels dated back to 1995, when Michaels had hired Sid as a bodyguard. Sid interfered during the Michaels vs. Diesel main event at WrestleMania XI by distracting the referee, but the plan backfired when the referee was unable to count the pinfall after Michaels superkicked Diesel. On the following night's episode of \"Monday Night Raw\", Michaels told Sid that he would not be needed in the case of a Michaels vs. Diesel rematch. Sid responded by turning on Michaels and powerbombing him three times. This attack led to a feud between Sid and Diesel, but Sid and Michaels were reunited as partners in an elimination match at Survivor Series 1995. During the match, Michaels accidentally kicked Sid in the face, which led to Sid being eliminated. Sid retaliated by powerbombing Michaels again. Once again, the feud was not developed, as Sid left the WWF. Sid returned to the WWF on the July 8, 1996 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\" when Michaels introduced him as a partner in a six-man match at . Sid helped Michaels several times in the coming months by saving him from attacks by other wrestlers. At , Sid defeated Vader to win a WWF Championship match against Michaels at Survivor Series 1996. During the match at Survivor Series, Sid attacked Jose Lothario, Michaels' manager, with a television camera. While Michaels was distracted, Sid hit him with the camera and powerbombed him to win the title. A rematch was later booked for Royal Rumble 1997.\nEvent.\nThe event opened with the Intercontinental Championship match between Goldust and the champion, Hunter Hearst Helmsley. Before the match began, Goldust attacked Helmsley up the aisle, but they then returned to the ring where they continued to brawl back and forth. Later into the match, Helmsley would attempt to hit Goldust with the Intercontinental Championship belt, however, Goldust countered and grabbed the belt and hit Helmsley with it, and as Goldust attempted to pin Helmsley, Mr. Hughes, who was at ringside as a bodyguard for Helmsley, pulled Helmsley out of the ring. Hughes then continued his distraction on Goldust, which led to Helmsley delivering a Pedigree and pinning Goldust for the win, thus Helmsley retained the Intercontinental Championship.\nIn the next match, Faarooq faced Ahmed Johnson. Johnson won the match by disqualification after members of the Nation of Domination, who were at ringside, interfered on Faarooq's behalf.\nThe third match was the encounter of The Undertaker and Vader. Undertaker gained control early into the match; however, Vader gained control after Paul Bearer, who was at ringside in Vader's corner, hit Undertaker with an urn. The Undertaker did not retaliate, as Vader hit a Vaderbomb on him, which gained a successful pinfall for the win.\nThe next match was a six-man tag team match featuring wrestlers from the AAA organization between the team of Héctor Garza, Perro Aguayo, and El Canek against the team of Jerry Estrada, Heavy Metal, and Fuerza Guerrera. A slow-paced match between the two teams, as they exchange control of the match back and forth. Late into the match, the two teams brawled outside of the ring, as Aguayo hit Metal with a diving double foot stomp off the top rope, which gained a successful pinfall, thus Garza, Aguayo and Canek won the match. \nThe Royal Rumble match began with Ahmed Johnson and Crush, where the rivalry with Johnson and Faarooq continued, as Johnson eliminated himself after Faarooq came down the aisle to chase him. Stone Cold Steve Austin was the fifth entrant. There were clock issues from numbers 3 to 5 but were fixed for No. 6, Bart Gunn. Stone Cold Steve Austin during the match had two separate runs where he eliminated wrestlers one by one and having the ring to himself for long stretches. Numerous wrestlers from AAA were invited to be entrants in the match. Mil Mascaras eliminated Cibernetico and Pierroth and then eliminated himself by diving onto them at ringside; years later Bruce Prichard stated that this spot had been devised because WWE creative anticipated that Mascaras would refuse to allow himself to be eliminated by anyone else; the Mexican star had long been notorious for refusing to allow other wrestlers to defeat him. No. 24 was Terry Funk who jumped ahead a little bit before the buzzer went off. The final five wrestlers were The Undertaker, Vader, Bret Hart, Diesel, and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The first of those wrestlers to be tossed over the top rope was Austin, who was thrown out by Hart. However, the officials were occupied trying to separate Terry Funk and Mankind, who were brawling with each other outside the ring, and thus no one saw Austin's elimination. Meanwhile, Vader and Undertaker began brawling with each other as a continuation of their feud and Hart began fighting with Diesel as Austin reentered the ring. Austin dumped both Undertaker and Vader out of the ring, while Hart eliminated Diesel. As Hart was celebrating, thinking he had won, Austin came in from behind and tossed him over the top rope. Since Austin was still considered to be in the match and was the only man left in the ring, the officials declared him the winner. With ten eliminations, Austin tied Hulk Hogan for the most eliminations in single Royal Rumble match. The record stood until 2001, when Kane eliminated eleven competitors.\nThe main event was a WWF Championship match between Shawn Michaels and Sycho Sid. Sid dominated most of the match and worked over on Michaels's back early into the match, however Michaels retaliated by hitting a flying elbow drop on Sid. Michaels then attempted to deliver Sweet Chin Music to Sid, however, he countered by tossing Michaels over the top rope onto ringside. As Sid threw Michaels back into the ring, Michaels accidentally hit referee Earl Hebner. Sid then delivered a Chokeslam and attempted to pin him, however, as the first referee was down, a second referee came out to count the pin, which got a two count. Sid then attacked the second referee, which allowed Michaels to hit Sid with a camera and delivered Sweet Chin Music, as the original referee slowly counted the successful pinfall, thus Michaels won the WWF Championship.\nAftermath.\nShawn Michaels later vacated the WWF Championship on the \"Thursday Raw Thursday\" special, where he gave his now-infamous \"lost my smile\" promo, citing knee problems as his reason to abdicate the title. Due to this and the controversial situation over the Royal Rumble ending, Stone Cold Steve Austin, Bret Hart, The Undertaker, and Vader were pitted against each other at in a Four Corners match for the vacant WWF Championship, which saw Hart win the title. The next night on \"Raw\", Austin interfered in a WWF Title match between Hart and Sid, causing Hart to lose the title after only one day. On the March 17 edition of \"Raw\", Hart and Sid faced off in a Steel Cage match for the WWF Title. Sid won after interference by both Stone Cold and Undertaker. At WrestleMania 13, Undertaker defeated Sid for the WWF Title, while Hart and Austin battled each other in a Submission match with Ken Shamrock as the special referee.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds. Early in the Rumble match, Vince McMahon stated on commentary that they had problems with the clock.\n – indicates a wrestler from Lucha Libre AAA World Wide (AAA), who was in a partnership with the WWF at the time. \n – Winner\nAustin was eliminated by Bret Hart, but snuck back in the ring while officials were distracted by a brawl between Terry Funk and Mankind on the other side of the ring.\n Faarooq was eliminated when Ahmed Johnson (who had eliminated himself from the Rumble earlier on) came back into the ring with a 2×4 and went after Faarooq, causing him to go over the top rope.\nIn this match, Stone Cold Steve Austin tied the record for the most eliminations in a single royal rumble with 10. The previous record holder was Hulk Hogan, who eliminated 10 participants from the Royal Rumble 1989"

It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1996, the winner earned a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XII. The 1996 event was the ninth event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 21, 1996, at the Selland Arena in Fresno, California.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television show, \"Raw\".\nIt also was the first rumble than theme music was used when someone entered the rumble\nEvent.\nIn a match occurring on the \"Free For All\" preshow, Duke \"The Dumpster\" Droese defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley. WWF president Gorilla Monsoon stepped in after Droese was pinned and reversed the referee's decision, disqualifying Helmsley for using brass knuckles to knock Droese out. As a result, Droese won the right to be entry number 30 in the Royal Rumble match, while Helmsley had to enter first.\nFeatured matches on the undercard were the 1996 Royal Rumble match which was won by Shawn Michaels, who last eliminated Diesel to win the match, making it his second straight Royal Rumble win; Goldust defeating Razor Ramon for the WWF Intercontinental Championship; and The Smoking Gunns (Billy Gunn and Bart Gunn) defeating The Bodydonnas (Skip and Zip) to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nAftermath.\nThe 1996 Royal Rumble marked the first pay-per-view appearance of Steve Austin, here using the name \"The Ringmaster,\" a blond-haired master ring technician and the featured wrestler in the \"Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase's stable. His elimination was accidental as he was supposed to be in the final four, but he slipped on the ropes and fell out when he was doing a spot with Fatu. In the weeks following the Royal Rumble, \"The Ringmaster\" gimmick was met with lukewarm reaction from fans, prompting Austin to create a new look and gimmick for himself: the \"Stone Cold\" gimmick, that of a foul-mouthed individual who drank beer and freely spoke his mind, uncaring of who he angered or whether he had friends (he often attacked heel and face alike), openly disregarded the rules and fought until his last breath. As \"Stone Cold,\" Austin—who began his first major feud, with Savio Vega, under \"The Ringmaster\" moniker and continued it after changing his gimmick—went on to become one of the WWF's biggest stars and helped usher in the promotion's Attitude Era.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 2 minutes.\n – Winner\n This was King Mabel's last appearance until he returned on June 30, 1998, for a one-off match with Ken Shamrock on Raw Is War."

        "text": "The 1995 Royal Rumble was the eighth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 22, 1995, in the USF Sun Dome in Tampa, Florida. The event featured five matches on its card. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 1995 event, the winner received a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XI.\nThe main event was the 1995 Royal Rumble match, which Shawn Michaels won after entering first and outlasting the 29 other wrestlers. This was the first time that the first entrant won the match. The event also featured a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, where Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. The match was stopped when several other wrestlers interfered and the referee lost control of the match. Two other title matches took place; Jeff Jarrett won the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Razor Ramon, and The 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly won the final match in a tournament that determined the new WWF Tag Team Champions.\nSeveral storylines from Royal Rumble 1995 were carried over to WrestleMania XI, the WWF's next pay-per-view. Bam Bam Bigelow attacked National Football League Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, who was sitting in the crowd; this set up a match between the two at WrestleMania. Pamela Anderson was at ringside and was supposed to accompany the winner of the Royal Rumble match to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania. Although Shawn Michaels won the match, Anderson came to the ring at WrestleMania with Diesel. The Undertaker's feud with Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation also escalated, as DiBiase's men stole the urn that was said to give The Undertaker his power. Jarrett and Ramon continued to feud for several months, and Bret Hart targeted Bob Backlund because of Backlund's interference in the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and was considered one of the \"Big Five\" PPVs, along with King of the Ring.

The match generally features 30 wrestlers and the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 1995, the winner earned a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XI. The 1995 event was the eighth event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 22, 1995, in the USF Sun Dome in Tampa, Florida.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised five matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television show, \"Raw\".\nThe storyline behind the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match began in 1994, when Bret Hart was feuding with his brother Owen. After Owen was unable to win the title, he helped Bob Backlund win the belt from Bret at Survivor Series 1994. Three days after Survivor Series, Diesel faced Backlund and won the title belt. He agreed to grant a title shot to Bret Hart, who, like Diesel, was also a fan-favorite.\nAlso at Survivor Series 1994, Shawn Michaels and Diesel had an argument after Michaels accidentally kicked Diesel in the face. Although the pair held the WWF Tag Team Championship together, Diesel said that he did not want to team with Michaels any longer. The title was vacated, and the WWF held a tournament to determine the new champions. During the tournament, The Smoking Gunns were forced to withdraw when Bart Gunn was injured in a rodeo accident. As a result, the 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly took their place. The Gunns requested that they get a title shot after the tournament when Bart had recovered. The 1–2–3 Kid and Holly advanced to the finals, as did Ted DiBiase's team of Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka. The match to determine the new champions was scheduled to take place at the Royal Rumble.\nThe Undertaker had been feuding with DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation since his return to the WWF from an injury in August 1994. During the match between The Undertaker and Yokozuna at Survivor Series 1994, Irwin R. Schyster, one of DiBiase's wrestlers, interfered in the match by attacking The Undertaker. The feud between The Undertaker and Schyster escalated when Schyster performed a series of vignettes in which he repossessed such items as tombstones and burial plots from people he claimed had not paid their taxes before dying. During the feud, Schyster was escorted to the ring for his matches by a group of hooded druids.\nThe feud between Jeff Jarrett and Razor Ramon began in late 1994 when Jarrett challenged Ramon for Ramon's WWF Intercontinental Championship. They faced each other several times, but Jarrett was unable to win the belt. Jarrett, who portrayed an aspiring country music star, was accompanied to the ring by The Roadie, who often interfered in matches on Jarrett's behalf.\nAlthough no major feuds were featured in the Royal Rumble match, \"Baywatch\" star Pamela Anderson was in attendance at ringside. It was announced that she would accompany the winner of the match during his WWF World Heavyweight Championship title shot at WrestleMania XI.\nEvent.\nPrior to the live pay-per-view broadcast, Buck Quartermaine defeated The Brooklyn Brawler in a dark match. \nIn the first televised match, Razor Ramon defended his WWF Intercontinental Championship against Jeff Jarrett, who was accompanied by The Roadie. Ramon used his strength to dominate the opening of the match. Jarrett gained the momentum with a series of dropkicks and then choked Ramon with a sleeper hold. Ramon ran at Jarrett but was thrown over the top rope. He hit his knee when he landed, and The Roadie then hit Ramon from behind in the knee. Ramon was unable to return to the ring, so Jarrett was awarded the match via countout. Because the championship cannot change hands on a countout, Jarrett challenged Ramon to continue the match. Ramon agreed and nearly pinned Jarrett twice. Jarrett applied the figure four leglock to apply pressure to Ramon's injured knee. Ramon escaped the hold and attempted to perform the Razor's Edge. He collapsed under Jarrett's weight, however, and Jarrett pinned him to win the title.\nThe Undertaker faced Irwin R. Schyster in the next match. The Undertaker gained the advantage at the beginning and held it until Ted DiBiase called his druids to the ring. When The Undertaker attempted to attack Schyster from the top rope, the druids shook the ropes and caused him to fall. Schyster performed a clothesline to knock The Undertaker out of the ring, where he and the druids attacked The Undertaker. When the match returned to the ring, Schyster was in control. Both men got knocked down, however, and a druid snuck into the ring and rolled Schyster on top of The Undertaker for a pinfall attempt. The Undertaker kicked out and attempted to perform the Tombstone Piledriver. A druid interfered to prevent the move, but The Undertaker performed a chokeslam on Schyster to gain the pinfall victory. After the match, Ted DiBiase called out Corporation member King Kong Bundy to help Schyster attack The Undertaker and steal the urn, which was said to be the source of The Undertaker's power.\nThe WWF World Heavyweight Championship match was next, in which Diesel defended the title against Bret Hart. Diesel began the match by clotheslining Hart, but Hart gained the advantage by focusing on injuring Diesel's knee. He performed the figure four leglock twice before attacking Diesel outside the ring. Diesel regained the advantage by using his size and strength to throw Hart and perform power moves to wear him down. Hart tied Diesel's legs to the ring post with a piece of tape and kicked him repeatedly. Diesel recovered and performed the Jackknife power bomb on Hart. Before the referee could count the pinfall, Shawn Michaels ran to the ring and attacked Diesel. The referee ordered the match to continue, and the match went back and forth until Hart used the Sharpshooter submission hold to place pressure on Diesel's injured leg. Owen Hart interfered by attacking Bret, but the match was ordered to continue. Bret Hart and Diesel brawled until Bret rolled Diesel up for a pinfall. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Michaels, Jarrett, and The Roadie came to the ring to attack Diesel. Meanwhile, Owen Hart and Bob Backlund attacked Bret Hart. Because the referee could not control the match, it was declared a draw and Diesel retained his championship.\nBob Holly and the 1–2–3 Kid faced Bam Bam Bigelow and Tatanka next in the final match of the WWF Tag Team Championship tournament. Tatanka began the match by using his strength against Holly, but Holly soon turned the match around by performing a hurricanrana throw. Bigelow used his strength against his opponents, but the 1–2–3 Kid performed a hurricanrana on him as well. Bigelow regained the advantage by kicking the Kid in the back of the head and controlled the match until the Kid threw him out of the ring. Bigelow and Tatanka turned the match around again, using power moves to wear down their opponents. At one point, Bigelow held the Kid for Tatanka to attack, but Tatanka accidentally hit Bigelow instead. The match ended in a similar manner, as Tatanka knocked Bigelow off the top rope when Bigelow attempted to perform a moonsault. The 1–2–3 Kid pinned Bigelow to win the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. After the match, the crowd heckled Bigelow. He responded by pushing retired NFL player Lawrence Taylor, who was at ring side, laughing about Bigelow's loss.\nIn the main event, Shawn Michaels was the first entrant in the Royal Rumble match, while Davey Boy Smith was the second participant. Every 60 seconds, another wrestler entered the match. As Owen Hart made his way to the ring, he was attacked by his brother Bret. As a result of the attack, Owen was quickly eliminated from the match when Smith, his brother-in-law, threw him out of the ring. King Kong Bundy and Mabel, the two biggest competitors in the match, fought until Mabel eliminated Bundy. Lex Luger then entered the match and eliminated Mabel. Bret Hart returned later and attacked Bob Backlund as Backlund was about to enter the match. This enabled Luger to eliminate Backlund quickly, after which Backlund and Bret continued to fight. The final four participants remaining in the ring were Michaels, Smith, Luger, and Crush. Luger attacked Crush but was eliminated by Michaels. Crush then convinced Michaels to work with him but then turned on Michaels by attacking him. Michaels scratched Crush's eyes, which enabled Smith to eliminate Crush. Michaels and Smith, the first two entrants, were the last two wrestlers remaining. Smith threw Michaels over the top rope and began to celebrate. Michaels, who had only touched the floor with one foot, was not eliminated from the match, however. He attacked Smith from behind and threw him out of the ring to become the first wrestler to win the Royal Rumble after entering first. Michaels celebrated in the ring with Pamela Anderson.\nReception.\nThe event was attended by 10,000 fans, which is approximately the maximum capacity of the USF Sun Dome. This attendance figure was down from the previous year's attendance of 14,500, but higher than the following year, when 9,600 people attended Royal Rumble 1996. From the ticket sales, the WWF gained $140,000; again, this was lower than in 1994 but higher than in 1996. The pay-per-view buyrate of 1.0, however, was higher than 1994's 0.9 figure but lower than 1996's buyrate of 1.1.\nCurrent WWE wrestler Cody Rhodes has stated that Michaels's win, in which he was the first wrestler to enter the ring in the #1 position and win the match, is his favorite ending to a Royal Rumble match. Reviewing the event for \"Online Onslaught\", columnist Adam Gutschmidt evaluated the event as acceptable but not exceptional. He found the Royal Rumble match to be the best part of the show, although he claimed that the WWF's switch to having wrestlers enter every 60 seconds hurt the match. He also found the inconclusive ending to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship match frustrating and rated the match between The Undertaker and Irwin R. Schyster as a \"dud\". The event has also been rated by customers at \"Amazon.com\", who have given the event four and a half out of five stars. Art O'Donnell, writer of the website WrestleCrap, has inducted the 1995 Rumble match into the site's list of \"the very worst in pro wrestling\". He cites that most of the Royal Rumble participants' gimmicks and the lack of main event wrestlers (such as Jeff Jarrett, Scott Hall and The Undertaker) as his reasons for including the match in the list.\nRoyal Rumble 1995 was released on VHS in North America by Coliseum Video on March 8, 1995. It was released in the United Kingdom in VHS format on May 8, 1995. The event, packaged together with Royal Rumble 1996, was also released on DVD in the United Kingdom as part of the WWE Tagged Classics line on April 17, 2006. On October 15, 2007, WWE released the event in the United Kingdom as part of the Royal Rumble Complete Anthology DVD set.\nAftermath.\nThe day after Royal Rumble, the 1–2–3 Kid and Bob Holly faced The Smoking Gunns. The Gunns won the match and the WWF Tag Team Championship. By losing the belts after one day, the Kid and Holly tied what was at that time the record for the shortest tag team title reign in WWF history.\nRazor Ramon faced Jeff Jarrett at WrestleMania XI in a rematch for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. To counteract The Roadie's interference, Ramon was accompanied by his friend the 1–2–3 Kid. Ramon won the match by disqualification but did not win the title. On May 19, 1995, Ramon defeated Jarrett in a ladder match to regain the championship, but Jarrett won the belt back three days later.\nThe Undertaker faced King Kong Bundy at WrestleMania XI. Although The Undertaker won the match, Kama, another member of DiBiase's Corporation, took possession of the urn and melted it down into a necklace. The Undertaker defeated Kama in dark matches at In Your House 1 and . They faced each other in a casket match at SummerSlam, which The Undertaker won to end the feud.\nBret Hart wrestled an \"I Quit\" match against Bob Backlund at WrestleMania. Hart won the match after special referee Roddy Piper determined that Backlund had conceded defeat. Bret's feud with Owen was not featured again, but the two did not reunite until they formed The Hart Foundation in 1997 with brothers-in law Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart.\nDespite Michaels winning the right to be escorted by Pamela Anderson to his WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Diesel at WrestleMania, Anderson came to the ring with Diesel instead. Michaels's bodyguard, Sycho Sid, attempted to interfere on Michaels's behalf but ultimately helped Diesel retain the title. Michaels became the second man to win the Rumble but lose their Wrestlemania title match. Diesel offered Michaels a rematch, and Michaels told Sid that he would not be needed in the upcoming match. Upset with Michaels, Sid attacked Michaels until Diesel came to Michaels's rescue. Diesel and Michaels became allies once again and teamed up to win the WWF Tag Team Championship later that year.\nBam Bam Bigelow challenged Lawrence Taylor to a match, which Taylor accepted after initially refusing. Diesel trained Taylor, who beat Bigelow at WrestleMania XI. Embarrassed, Bigelow challenged Diesel to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Tatanka was at ringside for the match; he turned on Bigelow and caused him to lose. Bigelow attacked Tatanka after the match, which led to Sid, a new addition to the Corporation, to come to Tatanka's defense. This led to a tag team match at King of the Ring, where Diesel and Bigelow defeated Tatanka and Sid.\nResults.\nTournament bracket.\nThe tournament was held between December 1994 and January 22, 1995. The tournament brackets were:\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every minute.\n – Winner"

        "text": "The 1994 Royal Rumble was the seventh annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on Saturday, January 22, 1994, at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island—the final Royal Rumble held on a Saturday until the 2022 event. Six matches were contested at the event, including one dark match.\nFor the 1993 event, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. The 1994 Royal Rumble match also awarded the winner the same prize, which was a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania X, thus becoming the tradition for the annual Royal Rumble match.\nThe main event was the 1994 Royal Rumble match. Lex Luger and Bret Hart were named co-winners after simultaneously eliminating each other. The undercard saw Yokozuna defeat The Undertaker in a Casket match to retain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, The Quebecers (Jacques and Pierre) defeated Bret Hart and Owen Hart to retain the WWF Tag Team Championship, and Razor Ramon defeated Irwin R. Schyster to retain the Intercontinental Championship.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\", and one of the \"Big Five\", along with King of the Ring that was established in 1993. It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 1994 event was the seventh event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on Saturday, January 22, 1994, at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers. Prior to 1992, there was no prize for winning the match. At the 1992 event, as the WWF World Heavyweight Championship had been vacated, the prize for the 1992 Royal Rumble match was the vacant title. At the 1993 event, it was decided that the winner would be awarded a match for the championship at WrestleMania IX. For 1994, the winner again earned a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which was at WrestleMania X, thus establishing a tradition of the Rumble winner earning a world championship match at WrestleMania.\nStorylines.\nThe first televised match of the pay-per-view was supposed to be Ludvig Borga vs. Tatanka. The two were engaged in a feud that began prior to Survivor Series 1993. Tatanka had been undefeated in the WWF since his debut in 1991. Borga ended this streak on the October 30, 1993, episode of \"WWF Superstars\" (taped on September 28, 1993), when he hit Tatanka with a steel chair while the referee was distracted. As a results of storyline injuries from this attack and the beating he suffered afterward at the hands of Borga and Yokozuna, Tatanka was forced to miss the main event match at Survivor Series. Although Tatanka defeated Borga by disqualification on the December 20, 1993, episode of \"Raw\", the bitterness between the two remained.\nBorga suffered a legit ankle injury, however, and was replaced by Bam Bam Bigelow. Although the substitution took place shortly before the event, Bigelow and Tatanka also had a heated rivalry. In 1993, Bigelow had cut Tatanka's dyed red hair as an insult to his Lumbee heritage. The two faced each other as part of a six-man match at SummerSlam 1993, but the feud continued even after Tatanka's team emerged victorious.\nAt Survivor Series 1993, Owen Hart was eliminated during an elimination match when he crashed into his brother Bret Hart, who was walking along the ring apron, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. He demanded a match with Bret to settle the dispute. Bret refused, and the brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays. They decided to focus their energy on taking the tag team title from the Quebecers. Their plan was temporarily put on hold when Marty Jannetty and the 1-2-3 Kid won the belts, but the Quebecers won a rematch the following week, guaranteeing that the Harts would get their title shot.\nRazor Ramon and Irwin R. Schyster (I.R.S.) began feuding prior to SummerSlam 1993 because of an angle in which Money Inc. (Ted DiBiase and I.R.S.) teased Ramon about losing to the 1-2-3 Kid, a newcomer to the WWF. The rivalry heated up when I.R.S. stole Ramon's gold chains while Shawn Michaels had Ramon distracted. Ramon and I.R.S. agreed to settle the feud at Royal Rumble 1994 with Ramon's Intercontinental Championship on the line.\nThe rivalry between Yokozuna and The Undertaker began at Survivor Series 1993. Yokozuna, who was pushed as an unstoppable monster, was unable to inflict any serious damage on The Undertaker when the two faced each other in an elimination match. Yokozuna slammed The Undertaker's head into the steel steps leading up to the ring, but The Undertaker was unharmed. Later, Yokozuna used his finishing move, the Banzai Drop, on The Undertaker. When he tried to repeat the move, however, The Undertaker became the first wrestler to sit up after the move, surprising Yokozuna and his managers. The Undertaker was granted a title shot in a Casket match. In the following weeks, it was revealed that Yokozuna had a fear of caskets. The Undertaker used this knowledge to gain a psychological advantage going into the match. On one occasion, Paul Bearer brought the casket to the ring to intimidate Yokozuna. When Yokozuna approached the casket to face his fear, the Undertaker popped out to scare Yokozuna.\nLex Luger wanted to participate in the Royal Rumble match, as the winner was scheduled to get a title shot for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania X. The contract he had signed for his title shot at SummerSlam 1993, however, stated that he would not receive a rematch if he failed to win the title. A compromise was reached, allowing Luger to compete. Yokozuna's manager, Mr. Fuji, was allowed to bring in two wrestlers, Genichiro Tenryu and The Great Kabuki, to hurt Luger's chances of winning.\nEvent.\nIn a dark match before the broadcast, the Brooklyn Brawler defeated Jim Powers. The Brawler used a swinging neckbreaker to get the victory. As the pay per view broadcast began, Vince McMahon introduced Ted DiBiase as his commentary partner for the evening.\nThe first televised match was between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow. Bigelow tried to attack Tatanka before the bell, but Tatanka moved. The two fought back and forth, and Bigelow gained momentum after Tatanka missed a crossbody from the top turnbuckle. Bigelow used his weight to keep the advantage, sitting on Tatanka and later using a bear hug to wear him down. After the two hit each other with simultaneous crossbodies, Tatanka began a war dance. Bigelow kicked Tatanka in the back of the head to regain the advantage but missed a moonsault attempt from the top rope, allowing Tatanka to perform a crossbody from the corner and get the victory.\nThis match was followed by the Tag Team Championship match. The match started slowly, but both teams soon began brawling in the ring. The Harts focused on Pierre, but Jacques was eventually able to tag in to rescue him. After Pierre regained the advantage, Owen tagged in and took control of the match. He applied the Sharpshooter to Jacques, but Pierre broke the hold. Bret tagged in but fell out of the ring and kayfabe hurt his knee when the Quebecers' manager pulled on the ropes. The Quebecers focused on Bret's knee until Bret regained the advantage and attempted to apply the Sharpshooter. He was not able to stand, however, so the referee stopped the match and awarded the victory to the Quebecers. After the match, Owen yelled at Bret for not tagging out of the match. He then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. This left fans wondering if Bret Hart would even make the Royal Rumble match itself.\nNext came the match between Irwin R. Schyster and Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Championship, for which Jim Ross and Gorilla Monsoon took over the commentary roles. The match began with a brawl between the two, and Ramon got the early advantage. Schyster eventually threw Ramon over the top rope and attacked him on the floor. I.R.S. kept control of the match for quite a while, applying a reverse chinlock while using the ring ropes for additional leverage. After Ramon escaped the hold, he was able to perform a fallaway slam on Schyster. He then used an Irish Whip to throw Schyster into the corner, but the match turned around with a ref bump when referee Joey Marella was in the way and was kayfabe knocked unconscious. Shawn Michaels ran to the ring with his fake Intercontinental belt and hit Ramon with it, and Schyster helped revive Marella to count the pinfall. I.R.S. appeared to win the title, but referee Earl Hebner came to the ring and explained the situation to Marella. When Michaels' belt was discovered in the ring, the match was restarted. Ramon simply grabbed Schyster, who was standing on the second turnbuckle celebrating, and performed the Razor's Edge for the victory.\nThe next match was the casket match; the first wrestler to get his opponent in the casket and close the lid would win the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Yokozuna had great difficulty inflicting any serious damage on The Undertaker, but it was soon revealed that Mr. Fuji had arranged for several wrestlers to get involved on Yokozuna's behalf. Crush, The Great Kabuki, Genichiro Tenryu and Bam Bam Bigelow interfered, but The Undertaker was able to fight back until Mr. Fuji stole The Undertaker's urn from Paul Bearer. Yokozuna opened the urn, and smoke poured out. Meanwhile, Adam Bomb, Jeff Jarrett, The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu) and Diesel then came to the ring to help Yokozuna. Eventually, Yokozuna and his allies were able to shut The Undertaker in the casket to end the match. They locked the casket and pushed it down the aisle until smoke started coming out of the casket. The Undertaker appeared on the video screen at the end of the aisle, vowing to return. The casket was shown exploding on the screen, although the casket in the arena did not explode. After the explosion was shown, Marty Jannetty (dressed as The Undertaker) rose to the ceiling of the Civic Center.\nBefore the Royal Rumble match began, commentator Vince McMahon revealed that WWF President Jack Tunney had shortened the interval between entrances from the traditional two minutes to 90 seconds due to time constraints. Kamala was supposed to compete in the match, but he was replaced by Virgil. Ludvig Borga could not compete due to his ankle injury and was replaced by Kwang, a newcomer to the WWF. In addition, the 1-2-3 Kid was replaced by Thurman \"Sparky\" Plugg, who was also making his debut. Bastion Booger was scheduled to be the twenty-fifth participant, but he did not appear for unknown reasons; Vince McMahon stated that he did not appear because he did not \"feel good\".\nThe Royal Rumble match began, with Scott Steiner and Headshrinker Samu as the first and second participant. Early in the match, Diesel tied a WWF record by throwing out seven consecutive wrestlers. He was ultimately eliminated by a group of wrestlers, while his partner Shawn Michaels kept aloof. Although Diesel wrestled as a heel at the time, his performance earned him applause from the crowd.\nSeveral ongoing feuds came into play during the match. Crush and his former friend, Randy Savage fought each other until Crush eliminated Savage. Bam Bam Bigelow and Doink the Clown also faced each other during the match. Doink had annoyed Bigelow with a series of pranks in late 1993, and the feud was supposed to be settled at Survivor Series 1993, but the team of \"Doinks\" that Bigelow fought was just The Bushwhackers and Men on a Mission dressed up as clowns. When they met in the Royal Rumble, Bigelow quickly eliminated Doink. The Royal Rumble match also saw an old feud rekindled. Shawn Michaels and Marty Jannetty, former tag team partners as The Rockers, traded a series of punches when Jannetty entered the match and Michaels ultimately eliminated Jannetty from the match. Due to being beat up by Owen Hart earlier in the night, there was a question as to if Bret Hart would even appear in the match. That question was answered when Bret Hart kayfabe limped to the ring as the 27th entrant in the match. Various different wrestlers went to work on his knee.\nThe final four were Fatu, Shawn Michaels, Bret Hart, and Lex Luger. The four sized up each other and then Bret Hart eliminated Fatu while Lex Luger took care of Shawn Michaels. Luger had Hart in a bear hug after punching his face a bit and then briefly lifted him up, but couldn't hold Hart up for very long. Bret Hart then moved both himself and Luger to the ring ropes. In an attempt to push Luger over the top rope, Bret Hart managed to push himself over as well. Both wrestlers crashed to the floor simultaneously which ended the match. Two referees argued about who had landed first while several inconclusive camera angles were broadcast. Meanwhile, ring announcer Howard Finkel declared one wrestler as the winner followed by the other. Eventually, WWF President Jack Tunney came to the ring and had Finkel declare both men co-winners. The situation regarding the title shot at WrestleMania X, which was to be given to the winner, remained unresolved until the following week on \"Monday Night Raw\".\nAftermath.\nLudvig Borga did not return to the WWF after his ankle healed, so there was no closure to his feud with Tatanka. The feud between Tatanka and Bam Bam Bigelow was also soon forgotten. In the summer of 1994, both wrestlers joined Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation. The two eventually formed a tag team and unsuccessfully challenged for the WWF Tag Team Championship.\nThe feud between Razor Ramon and I.R.S. ended shortly after the Royal Rumble. On the January 31, 1994 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\", the 1-2-3 Kid stole Ramon's chains back from I.R.S., bringing the feud to an end. Shawn Michaels’ attack on Razor Ramon increased the hostility between the two. The debate over the true holder of the Intercontinental Championship was settled at WrestleMania X in a ladder match with both belts suspended above the ring. This ended the feud between Michaels and Ramon, although Ramon continued to feud with Michaels' friend Diesel.\nOwen Hart demanded a match against Bret Hart, which Bret repeatedly refused. This situation was complicated because of Bret co-winning the Royal Rumble. Jack Tunney decided that both Bret Hart and Lex Luger would get separate title shots at WrestleMania X. A coin toss would determine who was to compete in the first title match, with the other wrestler facing \"suitable competition\". Lex Luger won the coin toss that was televised on Monday Night Raw; Tunney then made the decision to have Bret Hart wrestle his brother, Owen, in the opening match at WrestleMania. (Had Luger lost the coin toss, he would have faced Crush.) Owen won the match, but Bret came out of WrestleMania with the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after Yokozuna dropped the title to him. This led to an extended feud between the two that saw Jim Neidhart return to the WWF to side with Owen and Davey Boy Smith to make a comeback to take Bret's side.\nSeveral of the events during the Royal Rumble match led to feuds and pay-per-view matches later in 1994. Diesel's performance in the Royal Rumble match led to him becoming an up and comer in the WWF pecking order and he became the Intercontinental Champion shortly after WrestleMania X with assistance from Shawn Michaels. The duo later won the WWF Tag Team Championship the night before SummerSlam in August. At SummerSlam, however, Michaels cost Diesel the Intercontinental Championship by inadvertently kicking him when Razor Ramon ducked out of the way. Finally, at Survivor Series in November, the still-simmering tension between the two friends boiled over when Michaels hit Diesel with another kick intended for Razor during their Survivor Series elimination match. Diesel became irate and chased after Michaels, who escaped in a car and declared their friendship and team over.\nMeanwhile, Crush and Randy Savage faced each other in a Falls Count Anywhere match at WrestleMania X to settle their feud, and Doink and his midget sidekick Dink faced Bigelow and his kayfabe girlfriend Luna Vachon in a mixed tag match.\nThe Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months after his loss to Yokozuna. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. During his absence, the WWF promoted his return by showing video clips of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Ted DiBiase claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF, but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor. Paul Bearer claimed to have located the true Undertaker, which led to a match at SummerSlam 1994 between DiBiase's Undertaker (portrayed by Brian Lee) and Paul Bearer's original Undertaker. After defeating the false Undertaker, Bearer's Undertaker got revenge against Yokozuna by winning a Casket match at Survivor Series 1994. To help prevent outside interference, Chuck Norris was brought in as a guest referee.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every 90 seconds."

(Oceania is the only confederation that does not have an automatic place in the finals.) Its final round was the 2008 OFC Nations Cup. Consequently, New Zealand is also considered the OFC Nations Cup champion, and represented the OFC in the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.\nThis was the first OFC World Cup qualifying campaign since Australia's move from the OFC to the AFC.\nFormat.\nThe first phase began at the 2007 Pacific Games in Samoa, with the football tournament doubling as an OFC World Cup qualifying competition. The gold, silver, and bronze medallists (New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu, respectively) advanced to the second phase.\nThe three medallists joined seeded side New Zealand in a home-and-away round-robin tournament on FIFA match dates in 2007 and 2008, also acting as the 2008 OFC Nations Cup.\nThere were some confusion as to how the final qualifier for the playoff against an AFC nation would be selected. The FIFA website initially indicated that the top two sides from the round robin would advance to a play-off which would determine the qualifier, but the OFC articles did not include this round (with the round-robin winner advancing automatically). Later FIFA articles confirmed that the round-robin winner would advance automatically.\nFirst round.\nThe 2007 South Pacific Games held the first round. The draw was held on 12 June 2007 in Auckland, New Zealand. Tuvalu were not members of FIFA and so would have been unable to qualify for the World Cup had they proceeded to the OFC Nations Cup stage. It was not even clear whether Tuvalu would be eligible to advance that far had they finished in a medal position, as the OFC press release for the second stage draw stated that \"nine eligible member associations battle it out for the gold, silver and bronze medals that will hand them a berth in a Stage Two round robin home and away playoff with New Zealand\" - implying one nation (Tuvalu) would not be eligible. This question was rendered moot, however, as Tuvalu finished last in their table.\nPapua New Guinea, having initially entered the 2010 World Cup and indicated their intention to enter the South Pacific Games, were involved in a dispute with their sporting authorities and failed to meet the official accreditation deadline for the South Pacific Games. This meant they were effectively disqualified from the World Cup.\nKnockout stage.\nThe three medalists, New Caledonia, Fiji, and Vanuatu, advanced to the 2008 OFC Nations Cup (together with automatic qualifier New Zealand).\nSecond round.\nNew Zealand qualified for the play-off against the AFC playoff winner, as well as the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in South Africa.\nInter-confederation play-offs.\nThe Oceania champion (New Zealand) played the AFC playoff winner, Bahrain, in a two-legged play-off; New Zealand beat Bahrain to qualify for the 2010 World Cup.\nThe draw for the order in which the two matches would be played was held on 2 June 2009 during the FIFA Congress in Nassau, the Bahamas.\nQualified teams.\nThe following team from OFC qualified for the final tournament.\nTop goalscorers.\nBelow are full goalscorer lists for each round:"

        "text": "1939 was the 46th cricket season in England since the introduction of the County Championship in 1890. It was the one and only season in which English cricket adopted the eight-ball over. 1939 was the last season before the Second World War and it was not until 1946 that first-class cricket could resume in England on a normal basis. The West Indies were on tour and England won the Test series 1–0. The West Indian team departed early, with several matches cancelled, because of the growing international crisis.\nTest series.\nEngland played three Tests against West Indies, whose team included George Headley and Learie Constantine. The latter was recognised by \"Wisden\" in its 1940 edition as one of its \"Five Cricketers of the Year\" for 1939.\nEngland won the first Test by 8 wickets and the other two were drawn:\nThe third Test was completed on Tuesday, 22 August, the day before the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact which itself gave rise to passage of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939 by the UK Parliament on the 24th. Realising the gravity of the international crisis, the West Indian tourists cancelled their four remaining fixtures and sailed for home. The first of those was due to be played against Sussex at the County Ground, Hove, starting on Saturday, 26 August; the later three would have been against Kent, an England XI and H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI.\nCounty Championship.\nThe 1939 County Championship was determined on an average points basis because the county teams did not all play the same number of matches, the range varying from 24 to 32. Yorkshire won the title for the third successive season, playing 30 matches with 20 wins and 2 defeats to produce a points average of 9.286. Middlesex were the runners-up with 8.182 from 26 matches with 13 wins and 3 defeats.\nYorkshire were captained by Brian Sellers, whose efforts earned him a place in \"Wisden\"'s \"Five Cricketers of the Year\". The team had five batsmen who all scored more than 1,000 championship runs: Len Hutton (2,167), Wilf Barber (1,388), Herbert Sutcliffe (1,230), Maurice Leyland (1,191) and Arthur Mitchell (1,087). The bowling depended on Hedley Verity (165 wickets), Ellis Robinson (102), Bill Bowes (96) and Frank Smailes (49). The wicket-keeper was Arthur Wood who completed 39 catches and 27 stumpings. Other players included Cyril Turner and future England captain Norman Yardley.\nRunners-up Middlesex were well served by Test batsmen Bill Edrich (1,948 runs), Denis Compton (1,853) and Jack Robertson (1,562). Wicket-keeper Fred Price had an outstanding season with 53 catches and 20 stumpings. Middlesex relied heavily on its two main bowlers Jim Sims (142 wickets) and Jim Smith (84). Edrich and Price were recognised by \"Wisden\" as two of its \"Five Cricketers of the Year\".\nGloucestershire finished third under England captain Wally Hammond who scored 2,121 championship runs. Other good performers for Gloucestershire were batsmen Charlie Barnett, Jack Crapp and George Emmett; seam bowler Colin Scott and the outstanding spin bowler Tom Goddard who took 181 championship wickets.\nNoted batsmen at other counties were John Langridge (Sussex) with 2,106 championship runs; Les Ames (Kent), Joe Hardstaff junior (Nottinghamshire), Arthur Fagg (Kent), Eddie Paynter (Lancashire), Harold Gimblett (Somerset) and Laurie Fishlock (Surrey) who all made more than 1,700 runs. Walter Keeton of Nottinghamshire was recognised by \"Wisden\" as one of its \"Five Cricketers of the Year\" after he scored 312* against Middlesex, which was the highest individual score of the 1939 season and remains the highest ever made for Nottinghamshire.\nNoted bowlers elsewhere were Reg Perks (Worcestershire) and Doug Wright (Kent), the only others to take more than 130 championship wickets.\nLeading batsmen – all first-class matches.\nGeorge Headley had the highest average of batsmen who played in more than a handful of matches. He scored 1,745 runs at an average of 72.60 runs per completed innings with a highest score of 234*. The highest runscorer was Len Hutton with 2,883 at 62.67 with a highest score of 280*. Other leading batsmen were Wally Hammond, Denis Compton, Bill Edrich, Joe Hardstaff junior and John Langridge who all scored more than 2,000 runs.\nLeading bowlers – all first-class matches.\nHedley Verity had the best average of regular bowlers with 191 wickets at 13.13 runs per wicket with best figures of 9/62. It turned out to be Verity's final season as he was killed in action during the war. In his last appearance on 1 September, he took 7 for 9 as Yorkshire \"skittled\" Sussex for only 33. The most wickets were taken by Tom Goddard with 200 at 14.86 with best figures of 9/38. Other leading bowlers were Reg Perks, Jim Sims, Bill Copson and Doug Wright who all took more than 140 wickets.\nDebutants.\nAmong the first-class debutants in 1939 were future England players Alec Bedser, Godfrey Evans, Cliff Gladwin and Willie Watson. Those whose first-class careers ended in 1939 include Ken Farnes and Hedley Verity who were both killed in action during the war.\nImmediate impact of the war.\nThe season was almost over when war was declared on Sunday, 3 September and only ten first-class matches were cancelled. Four were due to begin on Saturday, 2 September but all were delayed due to the emergency and then cancelled after the declaration of war. Two earlier games involving the West Indian tourists had already been cancelled. Four remaining games, including Gentlemen v Players, were due to begin on different days during the following week and all were cancelled.\nThe final matches played before the war were six County Championship games that began on Wednesday, 30 August and were completed on or before Friday, 1 September, the day the Wehrmacht invaded Poland. Three of these games were completed with a result on the second day. Two more were ended as draws by agreement on the Friday morning after news of the invasion was reported.\nThe last match to be completed was Sussex v Yorkshire at Hove. From an overnight position of 330–3 in the first innings, chasing a Sussex score of 387, Yorkshire continued on the Friday morning and totalled 392 all out. Sussex collapsed in their second innings and were all out for only 33, whereupon Yorkshire made 30–1 to win by nine wickets. That ended the 1939 season and also marked the end of first-class cricket in England until the first of the Victory Tests began on 19 May 1945.\nThe few remaining county matches were cancelled immediately and Derek Birley commented that there was \"none of the unfortunate disposition to linger over it as in 1914\". Cricket in 1939 accepted the inevitable, summarised in the September 1939 issue of \"The Cricketer\" by Sir Home Gordon who found a suitable metaphor: \"England has now begun the grim Test match against Germany\".\nThe Third Test was the last match played at The Oval in 1939. Soon after war was declared, the ground was requisitioned and modified for use as a prisoner-of-war camp, but no prisoners were ever held there. Lord's was prepared for a similar fate but the authorities decided against it and Lord's was able to stage many games throughout the war to raise money for charity.\nH. S. Altham wrote in 1940 about a visit to Lord's in December 1939 as \"a sobering experience; there were sandbags everywhere and the Long Room was stripped bare with its treasures safely stored below ground\". Having painted a bleak picture thus far, Altham ended on a note of defiance: \"but the turf was a wondrous green, Old Father Time on the Grand Stand roof was gazing serenely at the nearest (barrage) balloon and one felt that somehow it would take more than totalitarian war to put an end to cricket\".\nIn the 1940 edition of \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\", author R. C. Robertson-Glasgow reviewed the 1939 season and remarked that it was \"like peeping through the wrong end of a telescope at a very small but happy world\"."

Yorkshire retained the County Championship title, having been the last pre-war champions in 1939. \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" (1947 edition), in its review of the 1946 season, remarked that \"the weather in 1946 might have been dreadful, but it didn't stop the crowds flocking to games\".\nTest series.\nEngland managed to arrange a three-match series against India, whose team was captained by former England player Iftikhar Ali Khan, the Nawab of Pataudi and included Vinoo Mankad, Vijay Merchant and future Pakistan captain Abdul Hafeez Kardar. Mankad was named by \"Wisden\" as one of its \"Five Cricketers of the Year\" in the 1947 edition.\nEngland won the First Test thanks to Alec Bedser's 11 wickets on his debut. The Second Test was drawn after India's last two batsmen held out for the final 13 minutes with England well ahead, Bedser again having taken 11 wickets in the match. The Third Test was also drawn after being ruined by persistent rain."

A system of batting and bowling bonus points was introduced into the County Championship, replacing the long- established \"first innings points\". The season was a watershed for Yorkshire too as, although they won their third successive championship title, the team broke up at the end of the season. The great fast bowler Fred Trueman retired and, following a stalemate in his contractual talks, Ray Illingworth left the club. Yorkshire did not win the title again until 2001. England and Australia drew the Test series with one win apiece so Australia retained the Ashes.\nCounty clubs were able to sign one overseas player who would not be subject to the normal residential qualification rules and so could appear for them immediately. All counties, with the notable exception of Yorkshire, took advantage of this. Nottinghamshire pulled off the coup of signing Gary Sobers.

        "text": "Frank R. Kitson (September 11, 1869 – April 14, 1930) was an American baseball pitcher.\nA native of Michigan, Kitson played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Baltimore Orioles (1898–1899), Brooklyn Superbas (1900–1902), Detroit Tigers (1903–1905), Washington Senators (1906–1907), and New York Highlanders (1907).\nKitson helped lead the 1900 Brooklyn Superbas to the National League pennant. He had 22 wins in 1899 and won at least 15 games five consecutive years from 1899 to 1903. He compiled a career record of 128–117 with a 3.18 earned run average (ERA) and 729 strikeouts. He appeared in 304 games and threw 211 complete games.\nEarly years.\nKitson was born in 1869 at Hopkins, Michigan.\nProfessional baseball player.\nMinor leagues.\nThe first record of Kitson's professional baseball career is in 1895 when he played for the Grand Rapids Gold Bugs in the Western League. He played in the Virginia League in 1896 and then in 1897 for the Burlington Colts of the Western Association. He compiled a 14–17 record for Burlington.\nBaltimore and Brooklyn.\nIn August 1897, the Baltimore Orioles purchased Kitson from Burlington. Ned Hanlon, manager of the Orioles, later recalled that he arranged the purchase of Kitson without having seen him. Interviewed in 1900, Hanlon recalled: \"I'll never take another man without first seeing him work. It took over a year to teach Kitson to earn the $500 that we gave for him, but it cost me enough worry to last a lifetime. He is now one of the best pitchers in the league, but when I got him he couldn't pitch a little bit, and as for fielding his position, that was out of the question.\"\nKitson's major league career got off to a roller coaster start in Baltimore. In his first start on May 19, 1898, he shut out the Pittsburgh Pirates. Six days later, the Cubs scored 20 runs off him; the game was called after seven innings with the Cubs ahead 20–4. In his second season in Baltimore, Kitson appeared in 40 games and compiled a 22-16 record in innings pitched. He ranked among the National League leaders with a 2.77 ERA (sixth), 22 wins (10th), and 34 complete games (10th). Kitson also contributed with a .314 batting average, three triples, and 16 RBIs.\nThe Orioles folded after the 1899 season, and a number of players, including Kitson, were transferred the Brooklyn Superbas. He was a key player for the 1900 Brooklyn team that compiled an 82-54 to win the National League pennant. He appeared in 40 games in 1900, compiling a 15-13 record with a 4.19 ERA in 253 innings pitched. He also helped his cause with a .294 batting average.\nHe improved in 1901, compiling a 19-11 record with a 2.98 ERA in 38 games pitched. He also led the National League with four saves. On July 25, he pitched a one-hitter against Christy Mathewson and the New York Giants, and \"The Brookly Daily Eagle\" reported that Kitson's \"speed, curves and command was perfect and the Giants were helpless in his hands.\"\nIn 1902, Kitson again won 19 games for Brooklyn, compiling a 19-13 record with a 2.85 ERA in 32 games pitched. He ranked among the National League's leaders with 19 wins (eighth), 109 strikeouts (ninth), and 29 complete games (10th).\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn October 25, 1902, he left Brooklyn to sign with the Detroit Tigers in the American League. In his first season in Detroit, he compiled a 15-16 record with a career-best 2.58 ERA. He remained with the Tigers for two more seasons, compiling a 9-13 record, 3.07 ERA in 1904, and a 12-14 record, 3.47 ERA in 1905.\nWashington and New York.\nOn December 5, 1905, the Tigers traded Kitson to the Washington Senators in exchange for Happy Townsend. He compiled a 6-14 record and 3.65 for the Senators in 1906. He began the 1907 with the Senators and lost his first three decisions with a 3.94 ERA. \nOn May 30, 1907, the Senators sold Kitson to the New York Highlanders. He compiled a 4-0 record for the Highlanders with a 3.00 ERA. He pitched his final major league game on July 22, 1907.\nIn 249 major league games, Kitson posted a 128–117 record with a 3.18 ERA. He also compiled a respectable .240 batting average (235-for-979) with 4 home runs and 95 RBI.\nLater years.\nKitson died in April 1930 at his farm located two-and-a-half miles north of Allegan, Michigan. He had been suffering from a heart ailment for several years before his death. He was interred in Hudson Corners Cemetery."

He made his starting debut at halfback against the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs the following week.\nAlexander was an unused reserve for Penrith's 1991 Grand Final win over the Canberra Raiders.\nFollowing the retirement of club veteran Royce Simmons at the end of the 1991 season, new recruit Brett Boyd was selected in the starting hooker position over Alexander to begin 1992. An injury crisis at the club (including to Boyd) allowed Alexander to remain in the starting line-up (playing at either halfback or hooker) until the week prior to his death. On 21 June 1992, Alexander played for Penrith in a reserve grade match against Eastern Suburbs, having been reportedly dropped from the first grade team for disciplinary reasons.\nDeath.\nAt approximately 10:10pm on 21 June 1992, Alexander, aged 20, was killed in a car crash in Colyton, a suburb in Western Sydney. Earlier that evening, the Panthers' players had been presented with blazers commemorating their 1991 success. The crash occurred shortly after Alexander left the function with teammates Scott Murray, Luke Goodwin, and Glen Liddiard to attend a nightclub in Mount Druitt.\nIt was reported that Alexander, who was driving, was not wearing a seatbelt when he drove through a red light and hit another vehicle, losing control of his own vehicle and crashing into a telegraph pole. Murray was injured in the crash (suffering a broken leg by one account, and a broken jaw by another). Although early reports claimed that Alexander had not been drinking that evening, it was later confirmed by the coroner that his blood alcohol content was 0.148, which is almost three times the legal limit of 0.05. Rumours that Alexander had been stopped by police shortly before the crash were denied.\nFuneral.\nA Requiem was held at St Nicholas of Myra Catholic Church in Penrith, with nearly 700 people in attendance inside the church and an estimated 4,000 people outside listening via loudspeaker. He was buried in Penrith Cemetery in Kingswood.\nImpact.\nDespite Penrith's premiership success the previous year, there was reportedly significant discontent within the playing group during the 1992 season. Head coach Phil Gould's perceived disfavouring of Alexander was said to have been a factor. Alexander's death, along with other internal conflicts, is said to have destroyed the promise of continued success for the club in this period.\nThe remainder of Penrith's 1992 season was disrupted as several players took extended periods of leave from training and playing duties. Brad Fittler withdrew from the n representative squad to play on 26 June 1992, while Mark Geyer (whose then fiancée, now wife is Alexander's sister Meagan) refused to train despite being issued an ultimatum, and left the club on 4 July amid other off-field issues. Greg Alexander, Liddiard, and Brook Kennedy were granted leave for an impromptu trip to Greece in July, which Geyer also attended. Liddiard was reportedly pushed out of the club for unspecified reasons after missing training sessions. Greg Alexander, who had been sidelined with a knee injury since April of that year, returned to the field on 2 August, playing off the interchange bench against the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles. Greg subsequently joined the Auckland Warriors for two seasons in 1995 as a way of dealing with his grief. He and Geyer both returned to Penrith in 1997.\nGreg has admitted that after his brother's death, \"I was never the same player.\" Gould told \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" in 2020, \"It's hard to talk about those days because we went from the highs to the lows very quickly. We won the club's first ever premiership then lost a special person in tragic circumstances the very next year. We were never the same people again.\" Liddiard told \"The Western Weekender\" in 2020 that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the crash.\nIn the 2010s and 2020s, Greg Alexander and Brad Fittler appeared in several road safety awareness campaigns reflecting on how Alexander's death impacted them.\nThe Penrith Panthers' rookie of the year award is named for Alexander."

        "title": "Jack Johnson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "John Joseph Louis Johnson III (born January 13, 1987) is an American professional ice hockey defenseman who is currently playing for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL). He has previously played for the Los Angeles Kings, Columbus Blue Jackets, Pittsburgh Penguins, New York Rangers, and Chicago Blackhawks. In his prime, he was a capable two-way defenseman, combining physical prowess and offensive capability. Johnson won the Stanley Cup with the Avalanche in 2022.\nFollowing two years with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program, Johnson was selected third overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft. After a year at the University of Michigan, his rights were traded to the Los Angeles Kings. He played another year at Michigan before signing his first professional contract with the Kings. In February 2012, he was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets after five seasons in Los Angeles. In 2018, he signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins in free agency. But after two disappointing campaigns, he was bought out by the Penguins and he signed a one-year contract with the Rangers. Johnson has represented the United States on the international stage multiple times, most notably playing for Team USA at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nJohnson's family moved to Bloomfield Hills, Michigan from Indianapolis shortly after he was born. He grew up playing for Little Caesar's in minor hockey. Johnson transferred to Shattuck-Saint Mary's Boarding School in Faribault, Minnesota before his eighth-grade year. As a sophomore during the 2002–03 hockey season, Johnson scored 15 goals and 27 assists as he helped the school's Midget Major AAA team win the U.S. National Championship along with current NHL player and former teammate Sidney Crosby.\nJohnson was drafted by the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round, third overall, in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft from the Team USA under-18 national team, but did not immediately jump to the NHL, instead playing for the University of Michigan in the Central Collegiate Hockey Association (CCHA). In his freshman season, Johnson set school records for points (32) and penalty minutes (149) by a freshman defenseman. After his freshman season, however, with the Hurricanes needing a defenseman and Johnson having committed to another collegiate season (the Hurricanes had tried to sign him after his freshman season ended), his rights were traded on September 29, 2006, along with Oleg Tverdovsky, to the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for Tim Gleason and Éric Bélanger.\nAfter his rights were traded, Johnson played one more season for the Wolverines, setting the school record for the most goals (16) by a sophomore defenseman in a single season and was named the CCHA Offensive Defenseman of the Year. During his tenure at Michigan, Johnson became a fan favorite for his physicality and end-to-end play.\nProfessional.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nAfter Michigan lost in the West Regional Semi-finals of the 2007 NCAA Tournament, rather than return to Michigan and finish the semester, Johnson jumped to the NHL and signed his entry-level contract with the Kings in March 2007, making his NHL debut on March 29 against the Vancouver Canucks. He played five games on the season, recording 18 penalty minutes and no points. Johnson recorded his first NHL point on October 10, 2007, assisting a Kyle Calder goal in a loss to the Dallas Stars. His first goal came on October 19, 2007, against goaltender Roberto Luongo of the Vancouver Canucks. Johnson scored three goals and eight assists that season.\nEarly in the 2008–09 season, Johnson suffered a shoulder injury that required surgery and missed 41 games.\nDuring the 2009–10 season, Johnson greatly improved his game, scoring eight goals and 28 assists, second only to Drew Doughty in defensive scoring for the Kings. His play earned him a selection to the Team USA at the 2010 Olympics, along with Kings' captain Dustin Brown; the two eventually won the silver medal.\nOn January 8, 2011, Johnson signed a seven-year extension with the Kings. At the time of the deal, Johnson led all Kings' defensemen in points scored with four goals and 24 assists. The contract carried an annual $4.3 million salary cap hit. He ended the 2010–11 season with a career-high 42 points, ranking sixth among all Kings skaters. His 2011–12 season with the Kings, however, was a tough one, as he failed to score at the pace he set in the previous season, recording only 24 points in 61 games by February 12, 2012.\nColumbus Blue Jackets.\n On February 23, 2012, Johnson was traded by the Kings to the Columbus Blue Jackets, along with a conditional first-round draft pick (Marko Daňo), in exchange for Jeff Carter. Upon arriving in Columbus, Johnson took the jersey number 7, which had previously been worn by Carter. During a March 8 game against his former team, the Kings, the Blue Jackets offered their fans a one night offer to have their Carter jersey nameplates changed to \"J. Johnson\" nameplates for free. Playing in 21 games for the Jackets after his trade, he recorded four goals and ten assists, for a total of 14 points. Johnson declared that he had no hard feelings in leaving Los Angeles, given that \"people [in Columbus] accepting me with such open arms,\" and \"I was looking forward to my new opportunity and getting the chance to play and be myself in Columbus.\" Johnson added that he did not follow the Kings' subsequent run to win the Stanley Cup, as he was in Finland playing for Team USA at the 2012 IIHF World Championship.\nWith the 2012–13 NHL lockout halting play to start the year, Johnson spent the lockout training so he would be in the top shape once the game returned. In the shortened 2012–13 season, Johnson was one of the Blue Jackets' alternate captains, and was considered the de facto leader of the team as Columbus nearly qualified for the 2013 playoffs. He scored one of his team's goals in the season closer against the Nashville Predators, and broke the Blue Jackets record for most ice time in regulation, nearing 35 minutes in a game against the Detroit Red Wings, which was also the individual record for the season. After his impressive showing of both on-ice skill and leadership, Johnson was considered a front-runner to become Columbus' first full-fledged captain since Rick Nash, though the Blue Jackets ultimately named Nick Foligno as the team's next captain.\nJohnson struggled during the first half of the 2013–14 season, with only 11 points in 43 games by January, a factor in the decision to not include Johnson on Team USA for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi despite being considered by many to be a lock for the team. His play improved in the new year, however, and Johnson scored 22 points in the 39 remaining games to finish the year with five goals and 33 points and help the Blue Jackets clinch their first playoff berth since 2009. The Blue Jackets lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins in the first round of the playoffs. Johnson led all Blue Jackets players in playoff scoring, with three goals and seven points in the six-game series, including two assists in a narrow 4–3 loss on home ice that knocked the Blue Jackets out of the playoffs.\nOn January 13, 2018, it was reported that Johnson requested a trade from the Jackets, citing a reduced role as well as a desire to better position himself as a free agent in the summer. Despite his earlier trade request, Johnson remained a member of the Blue Jackets after the trade deadline had passed on February 26.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nOn June 27, 2018, it was reported that the Pittsburgh Penguins were interested in signing him in the free agency period. Johnson's signing was made official by the Penguins on July 1, 2018, announcing a five-year, $16.25 million agreement. Johnson wore number 73 for the Penguins as veteran Matt Cullen wore his usual number 7. For the 2019–20 season, Johnson again changed his number from 73 to the number 3 following the departure of Olli Määttä, who had previously worn that number.\nOn October 5, 2020, the Penguins placed Johnson on unconditional waivers for the purpose of buying out the remaining three years on his contract. The following day, Johnson cleared waivers, making him a free agent.\nNew York Rangers.\nOn October 9, 2020, Johnson signed a one-year, $1.15 million contract with the New York Rangers. Johnson appeared in 13 games with the Rangers during the 2021 NHL season before it was announced on March 20, 2021 that he would undergo a core muscle repair surgery, effectively ending his season.\nColorado Avalanche.\nAs an unrestricted free agent (UFA) heading into the 2021–22 NHL campaign, Johnson was invited to the Colorado Avalanche 2021 training camp on a professional tryout (PTO) contract on September 1, 2021. After participating in training camp and appearing in 5 out of 6 pre-season games with the Avalanche, Johnson made the club's final roster to open the season, securing a one-year, $750,000 contract, on October 10, 2021. On October 13, 2021, Johnson scored the Avalanche's first goal of the 2021–22 season against the Chicago Blackhawks. On March 1, 2022, Johnson played his 1000th NHL Game. The Avalanche finished second in the league in the regular season, and Johnson played all but eight of the Avalanche's games in the regular season.\nWith Bowen Byram having returned from injury and newly-acquired Josh Manson having passed Johnson on the depth chart, however, Johnson was first a healthy scratch in the postseason. He did not participate in the first-round sweep of the Nashville Predators, nor was he active in the first three games of the second round against the St. Louis Blues. A season-ending sternum injury to Sam Girard in Game 3, however, elevated Johnson to the active roster once again. He went on to play all 13 games needed before the Avalanche won the Stanley Cup, finishing the Blues in three more games, sweeping the Edmonton Oilers and defeating the Tampa Bay Lightning in six games.\nChicago Blackhawks.\nAfter winning the Stanley Cup as a member of the Avalanche, Johnson left as a free agent to sign a one-year, $950,000 contract with the Chicago Blackhawks on August 17, 2022. Johnson made his Blackhawks debut on opening night of the season against the Avalanche, joining his former club in the raising of the Stanley Cup banner and appearing on ice for the ceremony on October 12, 2022. Deployed in an elevated top-four pairing role with the rebuilding Blackhawks, Johnson registered his first point with Chicago, assisting on a Sam Lafferty goal, in a 5-2 victory over the San Jose Sharks on October 15, 2022. Adding a veteran presence, Johnson added 4 assists through 58 regular season games.\nReturn to Colorado.\nApproaching the trade deadline, Johnson returned to the Avalanche for a second stint, after a trade with the Blackhawks in exchange for Andreas Englund on February 26, 2023.\nAs a free agent, Johnson opted to continue his tenure with the Avalanche, re-signing to a one-year, $775,0000 contract extension on July 2, 2023.\nInternational play.\n \n \nJohnson was first selected to the United States junior team at the 2004 IIHF World Championship. Despite failing to medal in the 2006 World Junior Championships, he was selected to the All-Star Team of the Tournament.\nJohnson was named to his first Olympic team on January 1, 2010. Johnson marched on behalf of the United States Olympic team in the opening ceremony in Vancouver on February 12, 2010, being the first American-born NHL player to march in the Olympic opening ceremony. In six games with Team USA, Johnson collected one assist and helped claim a silver medal. In the following 2010 IIHF World Championship, he was selected and named as captain of Team USA.\nPersonal life and legal issues.\nJohnson is married to Kelly Quinn, the sister of former National Football League (NFL) quarterback Brady Quinn. He is the brother-in-law of former NFL linebacker AJ Hawk.\nIn October 2014, Johnson filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, claiming just $50,000 in assets against $10 to $15 million in estimated debts. In 2008, he decided he no longer needed the guidance of long established sports agent Pat Brisson, and would rely on his mother, Tina Johnson, to manage him; in 2011, immediately before signing his first major contracta seven-year, $30.5 million deal with the Los Angeles KingsJohnson granted his mother power of attorney over all his finances, despite knowing, as he claimed in a later lawsuit against lenders, that she had no idea how to manage financial planning. Over the next few years, she and Johnson's father, John II, took out several large, high-interest loans against Johnson's future earnings, a lending practice known as \"monetizing,\" and spent the money on homes, cars and travel.\nLenders, among whom was Iowa Congressman-elect Rod Blum, eventually brought three lawsuits against Johnson for defaulting on over $6 million in debt. In court documents, Johnson claimed to have had no knowledge of his parents' spending, but would not be pursuing criminal charges against them. Instead, he filed lawsuits, totalling at least $1.5 million, including for punitive damages, against: Johnson admitted that he signed documents, without question, that his mother brought him, but that the fault lay with the parties he was suing. By 2016, Johnson had come to an agreement with almost all of his creditors and agreed to liquidate two homes and a luxury car and would only keep $246,000 each of the next two seasons, making him the \"lowest-paid player in the NHL for the next two seasons.\"\nIn the spring of 2022, at age 35, Johnson graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in general studies."

        "text": "Robert Alexander Gould (born September 2, 1957) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player. He played eleven seasons in the National Hockey League between 1980 and 1990 with the Atlanta Flames, Calgary Flames, Washington Capitals, and Boston Bruins.\nPlaying career.\nBob Gould was drafted by the Atlanta Flames of the National Hockey League in the seventh round, 118th overall, of the 1977 NHL amateur draft. He was also drafted by the Calgary Cowboys of the World Hockey Association in the eighth round, 70th overall, of the 1977 WHA Amateur Draft. Gould never played in the WHA, although he did eventually play in Calgary; after one game for the Atlanta Flames in 1979–80 he relocated to Calgary with the team the following season. He played parts of the next two seasons, 1980–81 and 1981–82, for the Calgary Flames before being traded to the Washington Capitals on 25 November 1981 along with Randy Holt for Pat Ribble and a second round selection from the 1983 NHL Entry Draft.\nAfter three seasons of bouncing between the minors and the NHL, Gould finally got a chance to play full-time at the NHL level with the Capitals and made the most of it, scoring 18 goals and 31 points in his first 60 games. He continued to play well with three straight seasons with over 20 goals, peaking in 1986–87 with a career-high 23 goals and 50 points.\nGould is also remembered for a March 20, 1987 fight with Mario Lemieux. Giving up 6 inches and 25 lbs, Gould ended up breaking Lemieux's jaw with a solid right uppercut. Lemieux spent the night at George Washington University Hospital. \"The first thing that came to mind when he said, 'Let's go,' was that I could get him off the ice for five minutes,\" Gould said. \"I never thought about hurting him.\" Lemieux would not fight again in the NHL for another 9 years.\nNearing the end of his career, Gould was traded by the Capitals to the Boston Bruins for defenseman Alain Cote on 28 September 1989. This was Gould's final NHL season, and he helped the Bruins reach the Stanley Cup finals, including advancing past his former team, the Capitals. Gould played for the Maine Mariners of the American Hockey League in 1990–91 before retiring altogether.\nIn 697 NHL games, he finished with 145 goals and 159 assists."

The 11 teams with One-Day International status at the time of drafting qualified automatically for the World Cup. Meanwhile, the 86 other members of the ICC played off in a series of tournaments, forming the Cricket World Cup qualification process, to capture one of the remaining five spots in the World Cup.\nEuropean Cricket Council Trophy 2003.\nHeld in Austria in August 2003, the European Cricket Council Trophy 2003 was contested by 11 teams across 3 preliminary groups.

        "text": "Charlotte Rugby Club, nicknamed the \"Old Originals\", are a rugby union team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. They currently play in USA Rugby Division II, and are members of the USA Rugby South. They play home games at Skillbeck Athletic Grounds.\nCharlotte Rugby Club was founded in 1971. In the ensuing decades they became one of the most dominant teams in the region, often competing for state and regional championships. As a result of their success they were invited to join the Rugby Super League, the country's highest level of rugby union competition, in 2006. They competed in the Rugby Super League from 2006 to 2010. In 2012, Charlotte Rugby Club started their Senior Women's team.\nHistory.\nCharlotte RFC formed in 1971 by former college rugby players living in the Charlotte area. In 1974, some of the players decided to leave and form a separate club, the Charlotte Gargoyles. The succession prompted Charlotte RFC to adopt the nickname \"Olde Originals\" to distinguish themselves from the other Charlotte team. Charlotte joined the Rugby Super League in 2006; in 2010 they announced they would not compete in the 2011 Super League season. Charlotte RFC then competed in the USA Rugby South DI competition for the 2011 and 2012 seasons while fielding their “B” side in USA Rugby South's Division III matrix. For 2013 due to low player numbers and a lack of success at the DI level, Charlotte focused their energy on the DIII level, finishing atop their matrix and advancing to the DII competition where they have played since the fall of 2013.\nIn 2022, Charlotte became the USA Rugby Men's Club Division II National Champions. Charlotte who had not lost a regular-season match in the 3 years prior, patiently waited for their opportunity to compete in and win the National Championship after USA Rugby had a 2-year layoff from national competitions due to COVID-19. During the 2022 USA Rugby playoffs, Charlotte defeated teams from Atlanta, Tampa Bay, Austin Tx, Santa Monica, and Denver, to solidify their place as National Champions!\nGrounds.\nThe Olde Originals play their matches at the Skillbeck Athletic Grounds located in the Coulwood neighborhood of Charlotte. Built in 1988, the grounds includes a 5,800 ft² clubhouse with a 900 ft² deck overlooking the pitch. The grounds also has an apartment for the players and a bar room for social events. When it was first built, it was considered to be one of the finest rugby facilities in the country."

        "title": "Rugby union in Namibia",
        "text": " \nRugby union in Namibia is a popular team sport in Namibia and its predecessor province of South West Africa. Because Namibia was formerly ruled by South Africa, rugby in Namibia was frequently influenced by events in that country and its domestic competition.\nGoverning body.\nThe Namibia Rugby Union is the governing body for rugby union in Namibia. The organisation was formed in March 1990, the same month that it joined the International Rugby Board (IRB).\nBefore independence in 1990, the governing body was the South African Rugby Board. Earlier bodies operating in South West Africa, from 1916 to 1990 were the South Africa Rugby Football Board (for whites only) founded in 1889 and the South Africa Coloured Rugby Board, founded in 1896.\nHistory.\nPre-independence.\nIn 1915, during World War I, South Africa, being a member of the British Commonwealth and a former British colony, occupied the German colony of South West Africa, later to be known as Namibia.\nIt is believed that Namibian rugby began in 1916 when it was introduced by migrants from South Africa. Because of this, and the fact that Namibia was ruled by South Africa for so long, it can therefore be considered one of several countries within South African rugby's sphere of influence – including Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Eswatini, and Botswana.\nThe British and Irish Lions played games in South West Africa on several occasions – in 1962, 1968, 1974, and 1980. Because South West Africa was part of the South African polity, this meant that rugby there was tainted with the image of apartheid, and moreover, the independence of Namibia coincided with the period in which the Lions did not tour Africa, due to the controversy connected with this. When the Lions tours to SA resumed in 1997, they no longer played games against other African sides, as previously occurred.\nFrom 1966 to 1988, the Namibian War of Independence was in full swing with guerillas from the nationalist South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) and others fighting South African rule.\nPost-independence.\nNamibia came to international attention in 1991, when they beat the Italian side and defeated the touring Irish in two tests. Phil Matthews' team was beaten 15-6 in the first test, and 26-15 in a match just two months before they started their 1991 Rugby World Cup campaign. For the Irish to be caught unawares was hardly surprising – Namibia had previously languished in the B Division of South Africa's Currie Cup, and only pulled away to become an independent nation in the 1980s. After independence, Namibia had to mostly make do with games against Zimbabwe, most of which they won.\nThis did not, however, mean a total cessation of international tours to Namibia; for example, Ireland toured Namibia in 1991.\nNamibian rugby still bears some similarities to its South African counterpart, using an aggressive, fast-moving game, ideal for their arid conditions. There have been some attempts to remedy this, and the conscious effort to bring in black players has included caps for the likes of Eden Meyer. Big hard forwards such as Johann Barnard are complemented by fast running backs such as Henning Snyman, Gerhard Mans and Andre Snoop (who now plays rugby league in England). It remains to be seen if Namibia can shake off image as a South African satellite.\nJohn Robbie, former captain of Ireland and the British Lions paid tribute to Namibia, saying,\nThe first major hitch in Namibia's rugby ambitions came in the qualifiers for the 1995 Rugby World Cup when they were beaten 13-12 by Côte d'Ivoire, and drew 16-16 with Morocco, which prevented them from entering the tournament. Namibia had rested several key players against Côte d'Ivoire in this game. However, more recently Namibia have been the consistent representatives of Africa beyond South Africa itself.\nPresent.\nAs in South Africa, the sport is most popular among Afrikaans speakers, but is also enjoyed by many English-speaking white Namibians. The sport is popular among school children, but the rugby union–playing population in Namibia is still relatively small with 36 clubs as of 1990.\nAs a vast, sparsely populated country, with little infrastructure, players frequently have to travel huge distances to games. This is a common problem in many African countries, but one Namibia has dealt with better than most. Another unusual feature of Namibian rugby is a high proportion of evangelical Christians, who often hold prayer meetings before matches and sometimes refuse to play on Sundays.\nNational team.\nThe Namibian national team are commonly known as the Welwitschias.\nUntil independence, players for Namibia were also eligible to represent South Africa; Namibian-born Springboks included Jan Ellis and Percy Montgomery (although in the latter case, his birthplace Walvis Bay was an exclave of South Africa until 1994). Various players pursue their rugby careers in South Africa and in a number of European countries. Frik du Preez, the South African player, also lived in the former South West Africa for a while.\nNamibia's players are notable for their other professions. For example:\nDomestic competitions.\nCurrie Cup.\nThe Currie Cup tournament is South Africa's premier domestic rugby union competition, featuring teams representing either entire provinces or substantial regions within provinces. Before Namibia gained its independence in 1990, the team, as South West Africa, played in South Africa's Currie Cup competition. Their best result was in 1988, when they finished third. They won the B section Currie Cup in 1987, beating Western Transvaal.\nSouth African competitions.\nA Namibian team called the Welwitschias also participated in several seasons of South African domestic rugby. It entered the Vodacom Cup in 2010, 2011 and 2015. The Vodacom Cup is a second-tier competition primarily used for developmental purposes, which runs alongside the Super Rugby season and involves all 14 South African provincial unions, with some invitational teams from other countries, such as the from Argentina and from Kenya.\nAfter the demise of the competition after the 2015 season, the Welwitschias participated in the First Division of the Currie Cup competition, as well as the replacement competition for the Vodacom Cup, the Rugby Challenge, launched in 2017. However, prior to the 2018 Currie Cup First Division, a lot of teams were struggling financially. The Welwitschias were informed that they would have to pay the travel costs for teams travelling to games in Windhoek, but — after initial reports indicated that they raised the money with the help of World Rugby — they could not raise the required funds and announced their withdrawal from the competition.\nNRU Premier League.\nThe NRU Premier League is Namibia's national rugby league and is contested by eight sides from all over Namibia. The current NRU Domestic League teams are:\nInternational competitions.\nRugby World Cup.\nNamibia has made the World Cup on seven occasions, in 1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2019, and 2023 but has never won a game. In August 2018, the Welwitchias qualified for their sixth Rugby World Cup by defeating Kenya 53-28 in Windhoek. They competed in Pool B for the 2019 World Cup in Japan and drew a match against Canada to finish fourth in the group."

        "text": "The Morocco national rugby union team are a national sporting side, representing Morocco in rugby union. The team is also known as the Atlas Lions. Morocco is governed by the Fédération Royale Marocaine de Rugby. Morocco competes in the Africa Cup annually. The team has won the competition in 2003 and 2005. They usually play their internationals in Casablanca.\nMorocco has thus far not qualified for a Rugby World Cup, but have participated in the qualifying tournaments since the early 1990s. For the 2007 Rugby World Cup tournament in France, Morocco failed to qualify when they lost to Portugal, home and away meaning they would not make the Repechage 1 play-off against Uruguay.\nThe national side is ranked 47th in the world (as of 29 July 2019) while their best ranking was 20th in the world (on 5 July 2004 )\nHistory.\nMorocco played their first international match on 25 December 1931 in Rabat, which Spain won 14–6. Another match was held three days later, and Morocco managed to hold Spain to a 10-all draw. Morocco met Spain again in April of the next year, though this time in Madrid, losing 8–14. The two teams met again that December, Spain winning 14–0. After playing four internationals, no official matches would be played by Morocco until 1967.\nMaking their return to the international rugby stage, Morocco faced off against their old opponents of the 1930s – Spain, losing 3–0. Morocco then won their first match, at home in Casablanca, where they defeated Spain by one point. In late 1970, they were beaten by a non-cap French XV in Casablanca. The following year Morocco defeated Italy in Naples, and lost 25–0 to Romania at home, and in 1972, were defeated 73–6 by a non-cap French XV. In 1975 in Brussels they defeated Belgium. Morocco they found wins against teams like Italy and West Germany, and lost games to touring French sides, as well as teams like Romania. Morocco played a French XV in 1983 in Casablanca, losing 9–16.\nMorocco entered the 1991 Rugby World Cup qualifyings, in a three games pool, in 1990, losing to Zimbabwe by 0–16, and to Tunisia by 12–16, finally winning their last fixture to Côte d'Ivoire by 11–4.\nTheir qualifying competitions for the 1995 Rugby World Cup started in group 2 Africas, winning their first game over Tunisia by 6–5, in October 1993. They lost their second game to Côte d'Ivoire but did go through to round 2, where they lost to Côte d'Ivoire again, as well as Zimbabwe, and drew with Namibia.\nMorocco were a part of Round 4 for the 1999 Rugby World Cup qualifying for Africas, again playing Namibia, Zimbabwe and Côte d'Ivoire. Morocco finished second in the round, behind Namibia, and went through to a repechage round. Uruguay won a home and away series. In 2000, Morocco were included in the inaugural European Nations Cup for Tier 2 rugby nations . They performed well and the highlight was when they defeated Romania 18–10 in Casablanca. In the same season, Morocco also played an under-23 Springboks side. In qualifying tournaments for the 2003 world cup, Morocco played in the six nation split third round, losing to Tunisia by one point and defeating Côte d'Ivoire. In February 2003, Morocco defeated France Amateurs 32–22 in Rabat.\nMorocco's bid to qualify for the 2007 world cup in France kicked off in June 2006 in pool 2 of round 2 of the Africas qualifying tournament. They defeated Uganda 36–3 in their first match, and then drew Côte d'Ivoire 9–9. They then lost 25–7 in Windhoek and 8–27 in Casablanca to Namibia. Morocco advanced to the Repechage Round as Africa 2, to play Europe 4 – Portugal, who won the home and away series.\nMorocco failed surprisingly the early stage of the 2011 Rugby World Cup qualifyings, after a 9–21 loss at home to Côte d'Ivoire.\nAfter failing to field a team in the 2011 Africa Cup Division 1A, Morocco, along with Namibia were relegated to Division 1B for 2012. After losses to Madagascar and Senegal, Morocco were relegated to the Division 1C tournament for the 2013 Africa Cup, and as such, were eliminated from the 2015 Rugby World Cup.\nHonours.\nOfficial competitions.\nRugby Africa Cup\nSecond level\nThird level\nNorth African Tri Nations\nRugby Arab Cup\nRugby Europe International Championships"

They are most widely read by young adult members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nTitles.\nThere are thirteen books in the series so far, with the fourteenth anticipated to be released in the near future:\nGeneral synopses.\nThe main characters of the series are Jim Hawkins, his sister Jenny Hawkins and Garth Plimpton, and later, their family members and friends. The novels involve people from modern times being transported to the past (at various times and locations described in the Standard Works) by means of a cave in Wyoming called \"Frost Cave\" (a real cave on the Spirit Mountain in Cody, Wyoming) in the United States. They feature both Book of Mormon and Bible themes.\nThe first four books feature Jim Hawkins as the main character: first as a teenager, then as a young man in college, and in the third and fourth as a father of three children.\nCharacters.\nAntagonists.\n† Characters based on other historical records.\n\"Thorns of Glory\" and \"Zarahemla\" books.\nIn an interview included in \"The Passage to Zarahemla\" DVD, Heimerdinger said that volume 11 would likely be published in 2009 and would be called \"Thorns of Glory\".\nIn an announcement published on his official blog on November 22, 2009, however, Heimerdinger said that because of the complexities involved with the book he is currently writing, there will likely be two more volumes in the current adventure. Heimerdinger said that tentative plans are for book 11 (\"Sorcerers and Seers\") to be published in early fall in 2010, with volume 12 (more appropriately named \"Thorns of Glory\") to be published 6–12 months after book 11.\nLater in his official blog, Heimerdinger said that he had submitted the draft to his publisher, and he didn't know how far into the editing process they are. He did say, however, that \"as of now the publisher's plan is to release the book this fall — September, if I understood them correctly. Things can change, but as of now, that's the intent.\"\nIn even later blog posts, Heimerdinger stated that the story had gotten even more complex and would culminate in combining the Tennis Shoes Adventure Series with his Passage to Zarahemla series. The volume uniting the two series was Passage's sequel, Escape From Zarahemla. Future Heimernovels will serve as sequels to both series.\nIn 2013, Heimerdinger posted that \"For months I've told fans that the new Tennis Shoes book would be called Thorns of Glory. Most know that this book is long enough that my publisher will likely divide it into two books. I've presumed it would be Thorns of Glory Part 1 and Thorns of Glory Part 2, sort of like the Feathered Serpent books. HOWEVER, I think I've come up with a better title for the first of these 2 books: Drums of Desolation. Let me know what you think. Just know that Book 13 is likely still called Thorns of Glory.\"\nSubsequent posts confirmed that \"Drums of Desolation\" would indeed be the title of the next book. It was released on October 1, 2014, though an option to pre-order from Heimerdinger himself was immediately available.\nThere was a period of 6 years between Book 12, and Book 13. In a 2020 podcast, Chris says he hadn't started writing the Book 14 yet but that he wants to release it much faster. "

        "text": "Leon Michael Hart (born April 9, 1986) is an American football coach and former player. Hart played college football as a running back at the University of Michigan, from 2004 to 2007, and holds the Michigan Wolverines career rushing record with 5,040 yards. He was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts in 2008, and played three seasons in the NFL. Hart has worked as an assistant football coach at the University of Michigan, Syracuse University, Western Michigan University, Eastern Michigan University, and Indiana University Bloomington.\nEarly years.\nHart attended Onondaga Central High School just outside Syracuse, New York where he set the national career record for rushing touchdowns (204), career points (for a non-quarterback) with 1,246, and finished second in career rushing yards (11,045). Onondaga Central went 46–1 (), losing only a single game to Mohawk Central School, and won three state championships (against Dobbs Ferry, Briarcliff and Cambridge) during Hart's career.\nHis national career touchdown record of 204 was surpassed by Johnathan Gray in 2011 although he remains first in career points.\nHart also excelled academically in high school, scoring 1280 on the SAT and graduating in the top five of his class with a 94% average.\nCollege career.\nIn the 2004 season, Hart set a Michigan record for most rushing yards in a season by a freshman with 1,455. He rushed for nine touchdowns and had 26 receptions for 237 yards and a touchdown catch. For the 2005 season as a sophomore, Hart missed significant time due to a hamstring injury. He started eight of Michigan's 12 games and played sparingly in three of those. He finished the season with 662 yards and four touchdowns rushing and added 16 receptions for 154 yards and a touchdown catch.\nDuring the 2006 season, Hart rushed for 1,562 yards – the fifth-best season total in Michigan history – and 14 touchdowns. He also caught 17 passes for 125 yards. For his efforts, Hart was recognized as his team's co-MVP with linebacker David Harris. He was also selected by both coaches and media to the All-Big Ten Conference First-team, named a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, and placed fifth in Heisman Trophy balloting.\nAs a senior in the 2007 season, Hart was elected team captain along with offensive tackle Jake Long and linebacker Shawn Crable. He entered the eighth week of the season as college football's leader in rushing yards, but after an ankle injury sidelined him for two games, he dropped in the rankings. Hart finished the season with 1,361 yards and 14 touchdowns.\nIn his Michigan career, Hart rushed 1,015 times for 5,040 yards; both marks are school records. His 41 career rushing touchdowns are third-best in Michigan annals. Hart's 28 career games with at least 100 yards rushing and 5 games with at least 200 yards rushing are each the most in Michigan history. Hart lost three fumbles in his college career, two of which came in his last game as a Wolverine in the 2008 Capital One Bowl. In that game, Hart also passed the 5,000 yard rushing mark for his career, becoming only the fourth player in Big Ten history to do so.\nAwards and honors.\nNational awards\nConference honors\nTeam awards\nProfessional career.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nHart was selected in the sixth round (202nd overall) of the 2008 NFL Draft by the Indianapolis Colts.\nThird on the Colts depth chart behind Joseph Addai and Dominic Rhodes, Hart saw little action during the 2008 season, rushing for nine yards on two carries. During the second quarter of the Colts victory over the Baltimore Ravens in Week 6, Hart sustained a knee injury on an 18-yard reception from Peyton Manning. On October 15, Hart was placed on injured reserve, ending his season.\nHart missed the 2009 pre-season opener with an ankle injury. On September 5, Hart was cut by the Colts then was signed to the Colts practice squad on September 6. On October 4, Hart was reassigned to the Colts active roster, replacing Chad Simpson. On November 24, Hart was waived by the Colts. He was re-signed to the practice squad on November 25. Hart was promoted to the active roster on December 2. On December 6, Hart got his first touches of the 2009 season. He had 11 rushing yards and two receptions for 27 yards. He had 28 rushing yards on December 13. On January 3, 2010, in the first quarter against the Buffalo Bills, Hart scored the first touchdown of his NFL career on a one-yard run on a hand-off from Peyton Manning. On February 7, 2010, Hart had two carries in Super Bowl XLIV.\nDuring a 2010 matchup against the Kansas City Chiefs, Hart scored his second career touchdown. It was the only touchdown of the game, as the Colts won 19–9. On November 1, 2010, in a Monday night game against the Houston Texans, Hart rushed for an NFL career-best 84 yards on 12 carries. Hart was released by the Colts on July 26, 2011.\nCoaching career.\nIn August 2011, Hart accepted a job at Eastern Michigan University as the offensive quality control coach for the Eastern Michigan Eagles football team. He served in that capacity for the 2011 season and then for two seasons, 2012 and 2013, as the team's running backs coach. On February 4, 2014, Hart was announced as the running backs coach at Western Michigan University. On January 4, 2016, he was announced as the new running backs coach at Syracuse University. It was announced on March 2, 2017, that Hart was leaving Syracuse to assume the vacant running backs coach position at Indiana University Bloomington under his former coach Mike DeBord. On January 13, 2021, Hart was named the new running backs coach at the University of Michigan. On October 8, 2022, during the first quarter of Michigan's game against Indiana, Hart suffered a seizure on the sideline at Memorial Stadium in Bloomington, Indiana. He was carted off the field in a stretcher and taken to a hospital for evaluation. In the wake of Jim Harbaugh's three game suspension to open the 2023 season, Hart served as interim head coach for the second half of Michigan's 2nd game of the season against UNLV. On September 9, 2023, Hart led the Wolverines to a 35-7 win over the Rebels. In doing so Hart earned his first official win as a college football head coach, while also becoming the first African American to head coach at Michigan. \nHart won a national championship with Michigan in 2023, coaching Blake Corum to back-to-back All-American selections at running back."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (1988)",
        "text": "The 1988 Royal Rumble was the inaugural Royal Rumble professional wrestling event produced by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). It took place on January 24, 1988, at the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The event aired as a television special on the USA Network on the same night as Jim Crockett Promotions' Bunkhouse Stampede pay-per-view (PPV) and was centered on the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. It would be the only Royal Rumble event to broadcast as a television special, as beginning with the 1989 event, it began airing on pay-per-view. After the launch of the WWE Network in 2014, this inaugural Royal Rumble was included with the rest of the Royal Rumble events in the PPV section.\nFour matches were contested at the event. The event was highlighted by the first-ever televised Royal Rumble match, which was won by Jim Duggan.The final match was a two out of three falls match in which The Islanders (Haku and Tama) defeated The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers). Additionally, The Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki) defeated The Glamour Girls (Judy Martin and Leilani Kai) in a two out of three falls match to win the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship and in the opening bout, Ricky Steamboat defeated Rick Rude by disqualification.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe idea for the Royal Rumble match was constructed by wrestler Pat Patterson. The rules were that each wrestler had to draw a number between 1 and 20, ostensibly at random. The #1 and #2 entrants would begin the match while the other participants would join the match every two minutes thereafter. Like a standard battle royal, participants had to eliminate their opponents by tossing them over the top rope with both feet touching the floor. The winner would be the last wrestler remaining after all others had been eliminated. \nThe first experimental Royal Rumble match happened at a World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) house show on October 4, 1987, at the Kiel Auditorium in St. Louis, Missouri. It was a 12-man match that One Man Gang won after last eliminating Junkyard Dog. Possibly because the event was not televised and a financial failure (drawing only 1,976 attendees), this event is not acknowledged by the promotion. According to Patterson, WWF Chairman Vince McMahon hated the concept from the start. Patterson was not at the 1987 show to guide the producers and the wrestlers. He said they had gotten the match concept mixed up. The original prize was a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against Hulk Hogan at the next St. Louis event scheduled for November 17, 1987; however, the ring announcer spoiled the Rumble result by announcing beforehand that One Man Gang would be Hogan's challenger at that following event.\nThe WWF then had a television special scheduled to air on the USA Network on January 24, 1988, emanating from the Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. \"Saturday Night Live\"s executive producer Dick Ebersol, who worked with McMahon on the \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" shows, was in charge of producing the special. Ebersol was unsatisfied with the event's planned card, and McMahon suggested Patterson to tell Ebersol about his Royal Rumble concept, which Ebersol thought was the \"greatest thing for television\". Patterson said that Ebersol saw the potential of the match, and Ebersol came up with the idea to add a countdown clock on the TV to build anticipation for the next entrant. Ebersol's endorsement was enough to convince McMahon to have the match as the centerpiece of the special, and the special was in turn titled after the match. The number of participants for the match was also increased to 20, but with no prize attached to the match.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised four matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWF's writers, while storylines were produced on WWF's weekly television shows, \"Superstars\", \"Wrestling Challenge\", and \"Prime Time Wrestling\".\nThe Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki) feuded with The Glamour Girls (Leilani Kai &amp; Judy Martin) over the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. Kai &amp; Martin were awarded the titles in August 1985 in Egypt. Kai &amp; Martin feuded with many tag teams and held onto the titles for over two and a half years. In November 1987, they began calling themselves \"The Glamour Girls\". At Survivor Series 1987, The Glamour Girls were part of WWF Women's Champion Sensational Sherri's team in a Survivor Series match against Fabulous Moolah's team. The Jumping Bomb Angels, part of Moolah's team pinned the champions to become the survivors for the match. After pinning the champions, The Jumping Bomb Angels signed a contract for the Royal Rumble challenging The Glamour Girls for the titles.\nEvent.\nThe first match was between Rick Rude and Ricky Steamboat. At the conclusion of the match, Steamboat attempted a diving crossbody but Rude pulled referee Dave Hebner in front of him to avoid any contact unto himself. Rude placed Steamboat in a Canadian backbreaker rack but Hebner signaled for the bell. Rude reacted as if Hebner was awarding him the match via a submission, but in fact, Hebner instead awarded the bout to Steamboat via a disqualification.\nDino Bravo attempted to set a world record to bench press 715 pounds. He was successful, but with help from spotter Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura.\nThe second match was a women's tag team two out of three falls match for the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship, as the champions The Glamour Girls (Judy Martin and Leilani Kai) defended the titles against The Jumping Bomb Angels (Noriyo Tateno and Itsuki Yamazaki). The challengers won the title after executing a double dropkick on Martin in the third and deciding fall.\nAndré the Giant and Hulk Hogan signed a contract for a WrestleMania III rematch that took place on the February 5, 1988 \"The Main Event I\". Tied into this was that Ted DiBiase had previously purchased André's contract from Bobby Heenan and promised André, should he defeat Hogan for the WWF Championship and then \"deliver it\" to him, that he would reward André with a large sum of money. During the in-ring promo, after he signed the contract, at DiBiase's prompting to \"give your stamp of approval\", André grabbed Hogan, slammed his head into the table and then tipped the table on top of him before the heels left the ring.\nNext was the match the event was based on – the Royal Rumble match. The first two wrestlers ever to enter a Royal Rumble match were Bret Hart of The Hart Foundation and one half of WWF Tag Team Champions Strike Force, Tito Santana. Hart hit Santana in the corner. Santana fired back but Hart hit him an inverted atomic drop, followed by a middle rope axe handle elbow drop. Butch Reed entered at #3 while Santana hit a flying forearm smash on Hart. Reed began nailing Santana until Santana dropkicked both Hart and Reed. However, the two men got the better of Santana. Reed tried to hit Santana who sidestepped, and Hart was accidentally nailed until Hart's tag team partner Jim Neidhart entered at #4. He helped Reed and his tag team partner Hart in attempting to eliminate Santana. Santana held on to ropes until Jake Roberts entered at #5, making the save for Santana. He tossed Reed out of the ring and eliminated him in the first elimination in the Royal Rumble history. He began pounding on Hart Foundation. Santana and Roberts tried to hit a Double DDT on Hart, but Neidhart attacked both men, saving his partner. Hart hit a jumping piledriver on Santana while Harley Race entered at #6. Neidhart and Race tried to eliminate Roberts while Santana nearly tossed Hart. Jim Brunzell entered at #7 and almost eliminated Hart before Neidhart attacked Brunzell, saving Hart again. Sam Houston entered at #8 and went after Hart Foundation. Tito Santana was then eliminated from the match.\nDanny Davis entered at #9 and began attacking Houston. Race attacked Roberts through the ropes. Roberts tried to hit a DDT on Davis but Davis blocked it. Boris Zhukov entered at #10. Zhukov's The Bolsheviks tag team partner Nikolai Volkoff and Don Muraco were quarreling over who was #11. The referees informed them that Muraco was #11 and Volkoff was #12. Zhukov was eliminated by Roberts and Brunzell. Brunzell dropkicked Hart but it had no great effect on Hart. Volkoff entered at #12 as Muraco clotheslined Race. Jim Duggan entered at #13 and received a nice reaction by the Canadian fans. All the wrestlers continued to beat each other until Ron Bass entered at #14. Volkoff prevented from Brunzell eliminating Davis. Brunzell pounded on Volkoff but was thrown out by Volkoff. B. Brian Blair entered at #15. Hillbilly Jim entered at #16 and eliminated Neidhart. Dino Bravo entered at #17. Bass had Houston on his shoulders and he threw Houston over the top rope, thus eliminating Houston in the process. The Ultimate Warrior entered at #18 as Muraco eliminated Bret Hart. Though Hart did not win the match, he set the first Royal Rumble longevity record for being eliminated at 25:42. The One Man Gang entered at #19 and he eliminated Blair and then Roberts. The final participant entering at #20 was the Junkyard Dog. Duggan tossed Volkoff out of the ring while on the other side of the ring, the One Man Gang eliminated Hillbilly Jim and later The Ultimate Warrior. Bass surprisingly attacked the Junkyard Dog and eliminated him from behind while Muraco surprisingly clotheslined Bass over the top rope as the final four left – Muraco, Duggan, Bravo and OMG. the One Man Gang nailed Duggan with a big splash in the corner and then the One Man Gang and Bravo began double-teaming on Muraco. Muraco managed to control both men until Frenchy Martin came out and distracted Muraco. Bravo and the One Man Gang was able to eliminate him. They went to do the same on Duggan. The One Man Gang attacked him but Duggan ducked and the One Man Gang accidentally eliminated Bravo. After a brawl with One Man Gang, Duggan eliminated him to become the first-ever Royal Rumble winner.\nA two out of three falls match between The Islanders (Haku and Tama) and The Young Stallions (Paul Roma and Jim Powers) closed the broadcast. The first fall concluded when Roma was tossed over the top rope by Tama – the ropes were low bridged by Haku – resulting in Roma injuring his knee. Roma was unable to return to the ring and got counted-out, giving the first fall to The Islanders. Powers worked much of the second fall, with Roma ailing on the ring apron, but eventually gave way to Roma after a taking a lengthy beating. Roma reluctantly tagged himself in but became an immediate victim to a Tama splash onto his injured knee. Haku then forced Roma to submit with a half crab to win the match in two straight falls.\nAftermath.\nHulk Hogan and André the Giant battled in their WrestleMania III rematch for the WWF Championship on February 5, 1988 \"The Main Event I\", where André controversially defeated Hogan for the WWF title. André sold the title to Ted DiBiase in exchange for a large sum of money but figurehead WWF President Jack Tunney vacated the title, making André the shortest reigning WWF Champion (at the time) with a reign of 45 seconds. An undisputed champion was crowned in a 14-man tournament at WrestleMania IV, where Randy Savage defeated DiBiase in the final match to become the new titleholder.\nThis Royal Rumble set a record for the highest viewed wrestling program on cable TV at the time with an 8.2 rating.\nBeginning with the 1989 Royal Rumble, the Royal Rumble became an annual January pay-per-view for the WWF, which, in 2002, was renamed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, which became an orphaned initialism in April 2011). The 1989 event also began the tradition of having 30 wrestlers in the titular match (with the exception of the 2011 event, which had 40). Beginning with the 1993 event, the winner traditionally earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. The 2016 event was unique because the champion defended the title in the match. While originally only contested by men (with the exception of Chyna, who took part in the 1999 and 2000 events, Beth Phoenix in 2010, Kharma in 2012, and Nia Jax in 2019), a women's version was introduced at the 2018 event, and the event now features a men's and women's match. Beginning with the pay-per-view broadcast in 1989, the Royal Rumble became one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, which were dubbed the \"Big Four\". From 1993 to 2002, these four were referred to as the \"Big Five\" along with King of the Ring, but that event was discontinued after its 2002 event. In August 2021, Money in the Bank became recognized as one of the \"Big Five\".\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\nA new entrant came out approximately every two minutes."

        "title": "Oxford University Cycling Club",
        "text": "Oxford University Cycling Club (O.U.C.C.) is a cycling club for students and associated members of the University of Oxford. Via earlier incarnations, the Dark Blue Bicycle Club (D.B.B.C.) and the Oxford University Bicycle Club (O.U.Bi.C.), it has a history reaching back to the very origins of club and competitive cycling.\nCycling is a discretionary full blue sport at Oxford with half blues awarded to the three riders comprising the fastest Oxford team in the Varsity Match against Cambridge, as well as three full blues awarded at the captain's discretion.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe history of club cycling at the University of Oxford, is extremely long and distinguished, but not continuous. The club has existed under three different names, and there have been periods during which no functioning club has been at all apparent. The Dark Blue Bicycle Club (taking its name from the identifying sporting colour of the University, known otherwise as Oxford Blue) was founded in 1873. Its stated objects were \"the holding of meets and races, the arrangement of tours, and generally to facilitate and encourage bicycling in the University\". Those local aims were soon to have national application as the club became centrally involved in forming and shaping the bodies that would organize competitive and recreational cycling in England and Wales in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. It was one of the eight clubs that met in Westminster on 7 September 1875 to establish an Amateur Championship. Founder members of the D.B.B.C. included the three who would represent Oxford in the first cycling Varsity match, which was held in 1874: Edgar Wing (Worcester Coll.), Charles Penrose (Oriel Coll.), and Charles F. Read (Queen’s Coll.) and, according to his own recollection, Edmund Denniss (Hertford Coll.). Rivalry between the two university clubs soon extended to the Hour Record, being first set and then bettered by their riders three times between 1876 and 1879, the two latter by Dark Blues, Weir and Christie.\nIn May 1881, the club changed its name to the Oxford University Bicycle Club, abbreviated to O.U.Bi.C.; the \"i\" distinguishing it from the Oxford University Boat Club. In Lent Term, 1882, the membership of the club stood at 44. The club continued as O.U.Bi.C. until it fell dormant in 1903. Since its inauguration, the Varsity match had been contested every year apart from 1885 (not held) and 1895 (abandoned), while over that period the format of the competition had varied considerably, from a road race between the two university towns to a track race meet.\nModern era.\nIn early 1939, several British regional newspapers announced, via a syndicated article, that: “After an interval of 37 years organised cycling has been revived at Oxford University. An Oxford University Cycling Club has been formed\". it was reported that members of the club had participated in an initial club ride on 29 January. The hope was expressed that Cambridge would follow suit, and that the Varsity races would soon resume. It did not, though, prove possible to organize a challenge race prior to the outbreak of World War II, mobilization for which stripped Oxford (and Cambridge) of most of its students and led to the disappearance of the so-recently reconstituted club.\nDuring the 1950/51 academic year a small club was once again active, though mainly for the purposes of recreational cycling. In the following year it acquired a handful of keen racing members, among them the ebullient Malcolm Prince (Jesus Coll.) who, with Brian Stackhouse (University Coll.) cycled to London to represent the club at the inaugural meeting of the British Universities' Cycling Union (BUCU). In 1953, the club organized the BUCU 25-mile T.T. championship and later in the same year it competed against the Cambridge University Cycle Racing Club (now CUCC) in a \"3-up\" team time trial on a \"neutral\" course near Whipsnade. Cambridge \"rode over\" to win, after the Oxford team suffered mechanical failure. The club at this time had a single female member, Margaret Wilkinson (Lady Margaret Hall), while J. B. Leishman (St. John's Coll.), the translator of the poems of Rilke, was persuaded to serve as the obligatory Senior Member.\nAfter another brief hiatus, the club was restarted in Michaelmas Term 1957 by Peter Hopkins (Exeter Coll.), Jim Thompson and Bill Speck (both Queen's Coll.), and a formal constitution was drawn up and approved by a large, new membership. It has enjoyed continuous unbroken existence ever since. The club was affiliated (for road racing) to the British League of Racing Cyclists and (for time trials) to the Road Time Trials Council. The club gained its first female members at this time. The first woman to join was  Anne Sims (St. Anne’s Coll.) in October 1957, with others soon following. Sunday club-runs became well supported and separate training rides were established. Touring immediately flourished within the club, co-existing happily with the racing imperative, and the first touring weekend took place during the Christmas vacation of 1957–58. Following a challenge from Cambridge, who had heard of the OUCC.'s revival, the first Varsity Match of the current series was held on the H23 course (Kidlington) on 5 June 1958; the contest being for a Varsity Shield, to be retained by the winning club until the next encounter. The only non-University, associate members allowed by the Proctors were the three senior officers of Oxford City Road Club, in recognition of the city club's friendly disposition to University cyclists. Their President was official timekeeper for the early Varsity matches when the OUCC took its turn to organise the event.\nIn its modern form, the annual Varsity Match has normally taken the form of a 25-mile individual time trial held on open roads under Cycling Time Trials (formerly RTTC) rules. An exception was the 1976 contest, which was decided over 10 miles. There is no limit on the number of University entrants, nor is parity of numbers required. The teams are decided by the results, as the three fastest times set by riders of each club are added together, and the winner is deemed to be the club with the lower of the two aggregate times. A Women's Varsity Match was introduced as soon as there were enough racing members in each club to form teams. OUCC. hosts the event on its local roads in even years, and CUCC in odd years.\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, a much-diminished membership reflected the national decline in cycle sport and cycling in general. Fortunately for the survival of OUCC, a steady trickle of committed ‘club’ cyclists, who already belonged to their local clubs and had raced as juniors, passed through the University club. As well as maintaining, through several lean years, all the essential events in the club calendar, including the inter-college ‘Cuppers’ 10-miles time trial, the club promoted the 1962 UAU. 50-mile championship time trial, in which it won its first individual and team medals at British Universities level; only Roy Cromack, then riding for Sheffield University, denying Bill Fowler (Keble Coll.) the gold. The outstanding racing member of the mid-to-late ‘60s was Mark Carritt (Univ. Coll.), a typical OUCC. ‘all-rounder’, though very untypical in that he excelled at every form of cycling competition. Carritt took the Bucks-Oxon-Berks road race title twice, as well as the British Universities road race, while in time trials he was among the best British 12-hour riders of his day, and, at the 25-mile distance, was the first OUCC rider to break the hour, recording a time of 58 minutes and 4 seconds in the 1968 Varsity Match.\nIn the early-to-mid 1970s, the club developed an interest in very long-distance rides, which included far-ranging vacation tours. It was through their membership of OUCC that the highly successful tandem tricycle pairing of Stuart Jackson and Edwin Hargraves came together, which took multiple United Kingdom place-to-place records. By the end of the 1970s, the racing membership of the club had dwindled to six including the Senior Member, Rolls-Royce Junior Research Fellow Lawrence Daniels (Keble Coll.). Defiantly, it entered teams in “3-up” and “4-up” time-trial “Open” events. This was the nadir of the modern-era club, but the demises of 1902 and 1939 were not to be repeated. The club began to grow, and in 1981, for the first time in its history, OUCC gained sponsorship. This came from Competition Cycles of Cricklewood, London, whose proprietor, Colin Freud (Christ Church Coll.), was a former member. Evidence of resurgence came in the windswept Varsity Match of 1982 in which six Oxford riders (also six Cambridge riders), riding the un-aerodynamic, steel bicycles of the era, all broke the hour for the 25-mile distance.\nIn the last decades of the century, a growing club membership and an improving gender ratio made possible a fuller club programme. The racing section embraced science-informed training methods, introduced in the early 1980s by research neurologist and club coach, Dr Eugene \"Gene\" Merrill. Performance testing and computer analysis was subsequently brought in by Dick Poole, the club's performance adviser of the mid-1980s. A fortuitous kerbside meeting in 2007 led to the club benefiting from the coaching services of former Giro d'Italia rider Flavio Zappi. The drive for competition success at Oxford, however, has never been at the expense of cycling for sheer enjoyment. While its Cambridge rival has always succeeded in focusing on the Varsity Match, OUCC (like the D.B.B.C. and O.U.Bi.C. before it) has a more wayward history. Writers have observed that the spirit of the Scholar Gypsy affects cycling at Oxford generally, attributing this partly to the nature of Oxfordshire's country lanes and the county's characteristic topography and scenery. The local woods now provide trails for one of the club's relatively recent accretions, the mountain biking section. Mountain biking, by virtue of ts popularity, has earned its own Varsity Match, held annually as a cross-country (XC) race, in which, like the traditional road time-trial event, the winning team is deemed to be that which finishes with the lowest aggregate time.\nInter-university achievements.\nIn 1983, the club returned to British Universities competition. In that year, it hosted the BUSF/BSSF. 50-mile championship and, a few weeks later, won the team category for the BUSF/BSSF 100-mile championship in South Lancashire. Since then, OUCC has been highly successful in competition, particularly in inter-university championships, gaining BUCS / BSSF titles in every type of road racing event; notable winning years being 1990 (Jonathan Atkinson: individual Hill-Climb), 1991 (S. Newington, D. Hulmes, S.

        "title": "Baseball in Cuba",
        "text": "Baseball was popularized in Cuba by Nemesio Guillot, who founded the first major baseball club in the country. It became the most played sport in the country in the 1870s, before the period of American intervention.\nDespite its American origin, baseball is strongly associated with Cuban nationalism, as it effectively replaced colonial Spanish sports such as bullfighting. Since the Cuban Revolution, the league system in Cuba has been nominally amateur. Top players are placed on the national team, earning money for training and playing in international competitions.\nHistory.\nThe early years (1864–1874).\nBaseball was introduced to Cuba in the 1860s by Cuban students returning from U.S. colleges and American sailors who ported in the country. The sport spread quickly across the island nation after its introduction, with student Nemesio Guillot receiving popular credit for the game's growth in the mid-19th century. Nemesio attended Spring Hill College in Mobile, Alabama, with his brother Ernesto. The two returned to Cuba, and in 1868 they founded the first baseball team in Cuba, the Habana Base Ball Club.\nSoon after this, the first Cuban War of Independence spurred Spanish authorities in 1869 to ban the sport in Cuba. They were concerned that Cubans had begun to prefer baseball to bullfights, which Cubans were expected to dutifully attend as homage to their Spanish rulers in an informal cultural mandate. As such, baseball became symbolic of freedom and egalitarianism to the Cuban people. The ban may have also prompted Esteban Bellán, an early Cuban player, to remain in the United States and become the first Latin American player to appear in the major leagues. Bellán played baseball for the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club while attending Fordham University (1863–1868). After that he joined the professional Unions of Morrisania, a New York City team, followed by the Troy Haymakers. In 1871 the Haymakers joined the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players, which is regarded by many historians as a major league. Bellán played for them in 1871 and 1872, then moved to the New York Mutuals, another NA team, in 1873.\nThe first organized match in Cuba took place in Pueblo Nuevo, Matanzas, at the Palmar del Junco, December 27, 1874. It was between Club Matanzas and Club Habana, the latter winning 51 to 9. Bellán played for Habana and hit two home runs.\nCuban baseball is organized (1878–1898).\nIn late 1878 the professional Cuban League was founded. At its inception the league consisted of three teams: Almendares, Havana, and Matanzas. Every team played the other two teams four times each. The first game was played on December 29, 1878, with Havana defeating Almendares 21 to 20. Havana, under team captain Bellán, went undefeated in the inaugural season and won the championship. The teams were composed of amateurs and were all-white, however professionalism gradually took hold as teams bid on players to pry them from their rivals.\nCuban baseball becomes international (1898–1933).\nThe Spanish–American War brought increased opportunities to play against top teams from the United States. Also, the Cuban League admitted black players beginning in 1900. Soon many of the best players from the Northern American Negro leagues were playing on integrated teams in Cuba. Beginning in 1908, Cuban teams scored a number of successes in competition against major league baseball teams, behind outstanding players such as pitcher José Méndez and outfielder Cristóbal Torriente (who were both enshrined in the United States' National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2006). By the 1920s, the level of play in the Cuban League was superb, as Negro league stars like Oscar Charleston and John Henry Lloyd spent their winters playing in Cuba. Furthermore, Cuban teams began flocking to the United States, and with it, intertwining Latino and African American baseball cultures. Defeats at the hand of colored teams in Cuba posed a threat to some Americans, one being the American Baseball League head, Ban Johnson, who had said, \"We want no makeshift club calling themselves the Athletics to go to Cuba to be beaten by colored teams\". This might have limited some opportunities but overall, baseball in Cuba was thriving and incorporating its own twists backed by the multi ethical ties of those who were playing it. It is often said that the United States is to thank for the spreading of baseball across the country, but it is really the citizens of Cuba, who were the ones who had a deep love and passion for the sport, so much so, that they can even be attributed with helping baseball spread to places like the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Venezuela.\nIn 1899, the All Cubans, consisting of Cuban League professional players, were the first Latin American team to tour the United States. The team returned in 1902–1905, exposing white Cuban players to U.S. major league and minor league scouts, and introducing black Cuban players to competition against the Negro leagues. Later Negro league teams included the Cuban Stars and the New York Cubans, which were stocked mostly with Cuban or other Latin American players.\nAmateur baseball in Cuba (1933–1960).\nAmateur baseball in Cuba was thriving in the 1940s and deepened the organization and maturity of the league. There were several amateur leagues in Cuba, referred to as . Many of the leagues were composed of factory or business workers who represented their individual companies. Originally, amateur teams represented exclusive social clubs in the Havana area, such as the Vedado Tennis Club. (In writing about amateur baseball in Cuba, Professor Roberto González Echevarría refers \"specifically [to] the game played by social clubs who played in the Amateur League\", as opposed to the semi-professional and sugarmill teams.) The growth of amateur baseball can be attributed to the economic recovery in Cuba around 1934. In 1934 there were only 6 teams, but by 1940, that number grew to 18.\nIn 1954, amateur Dominican baseball became better organized, respected abroad, and very structured which led professional clubs to draw young talent from the amateur leagues in cities throughout Cuba. The removal of some of the talented players in the league only slightly impacted the amateur leagues in Cuban cities. The young and talented team players who remained in the leagues gained physical strength by participating in the amateur games.\nOne major form of amateur baseball in Cuba was sugarmill baseball. Sugarmill baseball was popularized in the early 1950s. This group of amateurs consisted mainly of players who were workers at the sugarmill. It was often loosely organized and regionally established. Each team represented a different sugarmill, and they would compete against one another. Games were generally played on Sunday and holidays in order to leave weekdays reserved for field work. Players in the league used sugarmill ball as an escape from the harsh working conditions of the mill. During the Golden Age of Cuban League, sugarmill baseball was one of the most important producers of talent.\nIn Cuba's amateur baseball leagues, some of the greatest moments and players the game has ever produced on the island can be found, along with a high level of unconcealed iniquity. Until 1959 blacks were excluded from the amateur leagues. Segregation is traced back to the start of the 20th century when disagreement among players regarding the professionalization of the game led to a split. The amateur game was the origin of the segregation and remained a sport played among exclusive social clubs and factory workers. Membership in these clubs were restricted to whites, therefore blacks were excluded from amateur baseball and had to play for the semiprofessional teams. Whether the whites-only policy was a direct consequence of American influence on upper-class Cubans, or was a retention from colonial times is difficult to determine.\nThe growth of education in Cuba led to the decline of amateur baseball. As the players became more educated, they attempted to bypass the amateur level of ball and head straight for the professional leagues. \nFidel Castro was a keen baseballer who pitched for the University of Havana in the 1940's and attended games at El Gran Estadio del Cerro in Havana. In 1959, Castro committed to financing the Havana Sugar Kings, which won the Junior World Series in that year. As president, Castro implemented a system in which ball players could be locally sourced by state-sponsored programs. These programs allowed for young athletes to enhance their abilities. Every two to three years, players would be promoted to different levels based on skill. Parents were encouraged to place particularly talented children in the program at an early age. Children who participated in these programs were sometimes offered amenities such as more comfortable living, opportunities to travel and compete, pocket money, access to better food, etc. Placing a young generation in such state-controlled camps allowed for the regime to foster a new generation of loyalists.\nIn 1960s the government abolished all professional sports on the island. Sports were viewed as opposing the principles of the Cuban Revolution. With this thought in mind, the ideas of sport were altered to better coincide with the ideology of the Revolution. To reshape baseball was a difficult task. The idea of tradition had to be demolished and rebuilt. Rewriting Cuban baseball history by connecting the president to the glory years of the Amateur Leagues began to take shape and reflect revolutionary ideas. From then on, baseball and sports in Cuba were meant to encourage cooperation among nations, represent national pride, and promote fitness and military preparedness. Through sports, Cubans were able to feel personally involved in the nation building, socialization, and political integration of the revolution. Fidel Castro said, \"[w]e can say that our athletes are the children of our Revolution and, at the same time, the standard-bearers of that same Revolution.\"\nIn the 1960s, once amateur baseball became the main focus, there was a strong desire to play and participate in sports. Cuban baseball shed its commercial skin and sought out to advance the social and political aims of the revolution via sport. The organization of the game and role baseball led in society was transformed. Changes were revolutionary and discrimination in amateur baseball was abolished. The reorganization of baseball after 1961, the durability and expansion of the structure of baseball, construction of new stadiums, and the production of players are all significant results the Revolution had on Cuban sports. The island has remained the powerhouse of world amateur baseball since this time.\nBaseball in post-revolutionary Cuba (1961–present).\nIn 1959, the Cuban Revolution ushered in fundamental changes in how Cuban baseball was organized. The revolutionary government made baseball a symbol of excellence and used it to encourage nationalism. Shortly after the revolution, victorious guerrilla leaders demonstrated their Cuban spirit by engaging in exhibition baseball games that included symbolic gestures reinforcing the notion that baseball would be an integral component of post-revolution Cuba. In 1961, the Cuban government replaced the former professional baseball system with new amateur baseball leagues, most prominent among them the Cuban National Series. The reorganization aimed to organize the sport based on a socialist model of sports driven by national ideals rather than money. Revolutionary officials believed that under capitalism, sport is corrupted by profit motive. The perversion of sport was believed to result in the exploitation of the masses.\nThe shift from a professional to amateur system was preceded by the introduction of the Institute for Sports, Physical Education and Recreation (INDER). The Cuban government made success in sports competitions a primary goal in the hopes that international sports triumphs could draw positive attention to the Cuban Revolution. In addition to displaying Cuba's leadership to Third World countries, this would give Cubans themselves a sense of pride and feelings of nationalism for the Revolution. It was seen as a way of enhancing the revolutionary government's legitimacy. Much of Castro's vision towards establishing baseball as a prime means of nationalism was the state and government involvement in the sport. Local militia had a large role in monitoring the games. Many athletes were restricted to playing in their respective provinces. In many instances, it was up to the political authorities to decide important management decisions as well as salaries for each player. Sports participation in Cuba was also universalized and thus made an essential component of revolutionary activity. The term coined to describe such a process was , and sports served the purpose to educate and train the Cuban people, and another opportunity to fit in an egalitarian society that conformed to the very principles of the revolution. The Cuban people also became healthier due to their participation in sporting related activities, especially those that promoted physical education. Most Cuban sports facilities and the equipment they possess are adequate and meet the needs of the people as thoroughly as possible. INDER has branches at the municipal, provincial and community level and is ultimately responsible for the delivery of all sport and physical education functions; and the coordination of all sport related systems, structures and services delivered by political, health, cultural, community development, education and sports agencies and institutions that traditionally function independently of each other.\nAlthough sport in general underwent a huge transformation after the revolution, it is still imperative to note that baseball continued to play a pivotal role. After all it was Cuba's bloodline and was easy to pick up and play since it required less conditioning and more focus on the crafting skills of hitting, pitching, and strategy. Sports other than baseball retain some popularity in Cuba, including boxing and soccer, and the government continues to consider an athlete in fulfillment his or her duty as a Cuban citizen regardless of the sport pursued. As mentioned earlier, sport in post-revolutionary Cuba was utilized to not only improve health, but in doing so, citizens have become more prepared in-terms of self-defense in light of hostile policies at least in the early days of the revolution by the United States. Baseball, like all other sports in Cuba, was also utilized for political ends. For instance, Cuba has allowed for the Cuba National Baseball team to play in countries abroad such as Nicaragua to benefit flood victims and in Japan as a symbolic gesture to express goodwill for a strong trading partner. Such assistance by Cuba underlies its commitment to socialist internationalism, which still to this day sees a bevy of Cuban sports specialists training and instructing abroad citizens of other nations.\nSince the professional system was replaced by amateur leagues, players were not paid as extravagantly as they once were. Although members of the Cuba national team are nominally amateur, they were paid a sports leave wage determined by their principal occupation during the off-season—often less than annually. The situation would get worse in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which was Cuba's main trading partner. This led many players to defect to the United States due to deteriorating economic conditions. Amidst such action, even Fidel Castro admitted that it was hard to prevent the baseball stars from defecting. He would later proclaim, \"If you have to compete against six million dollars versus three thousand Cuban pesos you cannot win.\" Other problems included bribery scandals in which coaches and player alike would fix games, which subsequently led to them being banned from baseball in Cuba. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, there were also instances in Cuba where baseball games would be canceled due to power outages and most people chose to watch games from their home since it seemed more feasible to do so. The situation was so bad that pitchers in-game, would often have to exchange cleats with the pitcher who would have to pitch in the next half-inning. Resources even as minute as baseball cleats were scarce during this very time. The Cuban government to this very day is also somewhat hostile in relation to the players that did defect in the 1990s.\nIn amateur baseball fields, the home plates are made of wood. The fields are often in poor shape. The grandstands present at amateur baseball fields are protected by chicken wire and rarely painted. The maximum occupancy for a grandstand is 300 fans. Generally the stands are full, and often fans will stand on the sidelines to watch the games. The stands at amateur games are filled with cane cutters and factory workers looking to enjoy life after a hard day's work in the fields.\nIn 2008, Joe Kehoskie, a former baseball agent who represented several dozen Cuban players, told author Michael Lewis, \"There's at least half a billion dollars of baseball players in Cuba right now and probably a lot more.\" By the end of 2014, approximately 30 subsequent Cuban defectors had signed MLB contracts totaling just under $500 million.\nResumed exhibitions (1999–present).\nIn 1999, the Cuba national baseball team played a two-game exhibition series against the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball. This marked the first time the Cuba national team played against an MLB team, and the first time an MLB team played in Cuba since 1959. The Orioles won the first game, which was held in Havana, while the Cuba national team won the second game, which was held in Baltimore.\nIn December 2014, the United States and Cuba began to re-establish diplomatic relations. MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred entered into discussions to hold an exhibition game between an MLB team and the Cuba national team in 2016. The Tampa Bay Rays played the Cuba national baseball team on March 22, 2016, in Havana's Estadio Latinoamericano. The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the Cuba national baseball team, 4 to 1. The game was attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Cuba President Raul Castro and Rachel Robinson, the widow of Jackie Robinson.\nIn January 2019, pitcher Matthew McLaughlin joined the Plaza club in Havana's provincial league, believing himself to be the first American to play in Cuba's national baseball system in over 60 years.\nAmerica's effect on baseball in Cuba.\nBaseball was brought into Cuba by those returning from America in the late 1800s. While Americans may not have intended for baseball to become popular in Cuba, the sport had become a large part of the culture not just for the game but for what it represented to Cubans at the time. According to Rob Ruck in his article \"Baseball's Global Diffusion\", the meaning of the United States to the people of Cuba, \"a fresh, democratic vision of [Cubans] future\", was transferred to the sport (Ruck 200). However, the racial segregation that was prevalent in the United States in the 1900s affected some people of Cubas ability to play baseball. While in Cuba, there was no racial segregation in the game, dark-skinned and black players were unable to play in any minor or major leagues in the United States. Eventually, this was changed through the influence of Caribbean countries and Mexico, the unavoidable skill of dark-skinned and black players, and the shift of racial segregation in the United States. The United States had more influence in the beginning of baseball's journey in the Caribbean but it does not take long for Cuba to take the lead in making changes in baseball from racial segregation to the wages of players.\nNational teams.\nThe Cuba national team represents Cuba in international baseball. There are also a number of other national teams from the Under-12 team to the Under-18 team. In addition, there is a women's national team that represents Cuba in international women's events."

        "title": "Rugby union in Georgia",
        "text": "Rugby union in Georgia is a popular team sport. Rugby union is considered one of the most popular sports in Georgia.\nGoverning body.\nThe governing body for rugby union in Georgia is the Georgia Rugby Union. It was founded in 1961 (as a domestic body) and became an official affiliate to the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 1992.\nHistory.\nPrehistory.\nLike some other rugby playing nations, the popularity of the game in Georgia can be traced back to a pre-existing Georgian folk sport, called \"lelo\" or \"Lelo Burti\" (meaning literally in Georgian \"Field Ball\"), which is a full contact ball game, and very similar to rugby. In fact, even within Georgian rugby terminology, the word \"lelo\" is used to mean a try.\nLelo was played in Georgia from ancient times and is still played on occasions in rural areas. A field (\"Lelo\") was selected between two river creeks which represented a playing ground. Two teams, usually consisting of the male population of neighboring villages, would face each other, with the local priest acting as the referee. The number of players from each side was not set, but included any able men each village could summon. A large, heavy ball was placed in the middle of the field and the goal of the game was to carry it over the river creek of the opposing side.\nSoviet period.\nDuring the Soviet period, the Georgians regularly had six or seven players in the USSR side, before the break-up, as well as supplying the Soviet club champion, Dinamo Tbilisi. Rugby has been played in Georgia since the 1930s, possibly earlier, but its first \"official\" test was against a touring Zimbabwe side.\nThere were several unsuccessful attempts to introduce rugby into Georgia, the earliest known being in 1928, with subsequent attempts also in 1940 and in 1948. Rugby was introduced to Georgia by Jacques Haspekian, an Armenian man from Marseille in France who taught the game to students in the late 1950s through to the mid-1960s, although he then subsequently returned in France. He is still alive and living in Marseille, he was interviewed on French radio on the occasion of Georgia playing France in the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The very first rugby session was held on October 15, 1959, in Tbilisi, at the racecourse, where 20 people attended the meeting. The first Georgian club formed was the GPI (Georgian Polytechnical Institute), now known as \"Qochebi\".\nIn 1961, a three team domestic competition was formed, called the Tbilisi Championship. The following year the first match between a Georgian team and a Russian team took place, with Trud Moscow defeating the Georgian club. That year Georgian clubs also went on their first tours, going to Russia and Latvia.\nIn 1962, the first Soviet Trade-Union tournament was held. In the same year, ten new rugby teams were established in Georgia.\nIn 1964 the Tbilisi Rugby Section became known as the Georgia Rugby Federation. From the mid-1960s, the Soviet Championship and the Soviet Cup were introduced for competitive club competition between Soviet rugby clubs, with the first competition being held in 1966. The Georgian clubs were formed as regional selections fed by student teams. The best players would go on to make the USSR team.\nA Moscow team won the first Soviet Championship, though Dynamo from Tbilisi came in second place. In 1967 a French trade-union selection visited Georgia. It would not be until 1978, in the Soviet Cup (which was introduced in 1976) that a Georgian team would finish first, which was Locomotivi from Tbilisi. Georgian teams dominated the Soviet Championship and the Soviet Cup in the late 1980s with Kutaisi winning the championship in 1987 and 1988 and RC AIA Kutaisi winning in 1989 and 1990. In 1988 Georgia produced their first national sevens side.\nPost-independence.\nThe break-up of the Soviet Union led to a civil war, which helped set back the game greatly, and the recent Russian conflict with Georgia has also set it on a back foot. Half of all Soviet clubs were in Georgia. The Georgians applied for associate membership of the IRB in 1990, but were turned down. It took two years for the IRB to admit them in 1990, after consultation with the Soviet Federation.\nThe following year, Georgia played their first international match, against Zimbabwe, and won 16 to 3. With the collapse of the Soviet Union, Georgia formed their own national team (though a CIS team played in the early 1990s) and applied for International Rugby Football Board (now, International Rugby Board) membership. In 1993 the IRFB accepted Georgia as a federation member, making them the 52nd member.\nIn 1997, New Zealand coach Ross Meurant found the national team had only two practice balls, when he went to advise the Georgia Under-19 squad. This was typical of the lack of resources that the Georgians faced. Meurant said that the tackle bags that they were using were improvised:\nThe wife of another coach had stayed up half the night making them. This was not atypical. In the early 1990s, the Georgians had converted old Soviet era tractors into scrum machines.\nIn 1994 the Gumari were formed, being the Georgian Barbarians, and they went on to tour France. The following year saw the inauguration of the Sini competition. Their 1998 loss to Romania saw Georgia face Tonga in a repechage match to enter the 1999 Rugby World Cup in Wales. Georgia lost and thus did not make it to the World Cup. Though in 2001 they won the European Nations Cup, and became the 7th highest ranked team in Europe. They subsequently got through the qualifying stages for the next World Cup, and made it to Australia for the 2003 Rugby World Cup. They also qualified for the 2007 World Cup and went on to win their first World Cup match.\nCrowds as large as 10–15,000 regularly attend local derbies in Tbilisi.\nAs Georgia is a member of the Council of Europe, this gives Georgians employment rights within France, and many Georgian players are now based there. For example, in the qualifiers for the 2007 Rugby World Cup against Ireland, 18 of 25 players on the squad were based in France.\nNotable players include Giorgi Shkinin, and captain Ilia Zedginidze who was considered something of a \"Renaissance Man\" in World Cup rugby as a talented international lawyer with the ability to speak several languages fluently.\nCompetitions.\nThe Georgia Championship and Georgia Cup are the domestic rugby union club competitions in Georgia. Since most of the Georgian internationals play in France, its quality level does not match the popularity of rugby union across the country. A combination domestic side, The Black Lion, owned by the Georgian Rugby Union, was created to take part in international club competition. Originally entered into the European third tier Rugby Europe Super Cup, they are two time winners. The team were invited to take part in South Africa's traditional provincial competition, the Currie Cup in 2022, before finally being admitted to the main competition system in Europe, invited to take part in the 2023-24 EPCR Challenge Cup, the second tier continental competition\nPopularity.\nRugby union is one of the most popular sports in Georgia. Rugby is especially popular in the south of the country where the game is more popular than association football. The popularity of rugby union largely took off after the Georgia Rugby Union's inception into the IRB. This has seen rugby union become a major spectator sport. There are currently 2866 registered male players in Georgia according to the International Rugby Board. When Georgia played Russia in the European Nations Cup, 65,000 people crammed into the national stadium in Tbilisi and another 44,000 watched Georgia beat Russia 17–13.\nNational team.\nThe Lelos (as they are nicknamed) are the national rugby union team of Georgia. The team's name comes from lelo, an indigenous Georgian sport with strong similarities to rugby. Lelo has been adopted as the Georgian word for \"try\". One standard cheer of Georgian rugby union fans is \"Lelo, Lelo, Sakartvelo\" (Try, Try, Georgia). The Lelos participate in the European Nations Cup, which is a second-level competition for European national teams. The majority of the national side are based in France, in the lower divisions, having been sent there to improve their rugby skills and facilitate their development by coach Claude Saurel.\nWorld Cup.\nPrior to the 2003 Rugby World Cup, Georgia had failed to qualify for any previous tournaments, despite coming close in 1999 after losing a two legged repechage play-off against Tonga. On that occasion Georgia lost the first leg 37–6 in Nukualofa before recording a 28–27 win in Tbilisi. Georgia then bounced back to defeat Russia 17–13 to qualify for the subsequent 2003 Rugby World Cup. They lost all four of their matches but impressed against South Africa. Despite the poor financial state of the Georgia Rugby Union, qualification has seen the sport's profile enjoy a huge rise in popularity throughout Georgia. Their best performance was in 2015 tournament, when they were drawn against eventual world champions New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Namibia. Georgia won games against Tonga and Namibia, finished third in the group and automatically qualified for 2019 Rugby World Cup.\nEuropean Nations Cup.\nThe European Nations Cup is a second-level competition for tier-two European nations. Initially started as a one-year competition, the championship is now decided over two years with each team playing each other on a home and away basis. Georgia have won the competition on eight occasions, in 2001, 2008-9 and 2011–15.\nThe Antim Cup.\nThe Antim Cup is contested between Georgia and Romania. The cup is contested each time Georgia and Romania meet in a senior international match other than World Cup matches or qualifiers. The holder retains the cup unless the challenger wins the match in normal time. It is named after the Romanian Orthodox Metropolitan Antim Iverianul, who came from Georgia."

        "title": "1918 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1918 Stanley Cup Finals was contested by the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Toronto and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Vancouver Millionaires. In a series held entirely in Toronto, the Toronto team won the series by three games to two in the best-of-five game series to win the Stanley Cup. It was the first series contested by the new NHL and subsequently the first Stanley Cup win by the Toronto NHL franchise team.\nPaths to the Finals.\nPrior to the 1917–18 season, the National Hockey Association (NHA) had suspended operations as the result of a power play to oust Toronto Blueshirts owner Eddie Livingstone. The remaining clubs then met in November 1917 to form the NHL, using the same constitution and playing rules of the NHA. The NHL took the NHA's place in competing for the Cup in a playoff series with the Pacific Coast Hockey Association.\nThe Toronto NHL players were assigned from the Toronto NHA franchise, and played for a 'temporary' Toronto NHL franchise, operated by the Toronto Arena owners. This is why it is often called the 'Arenas' although no hockey club with the official name \"Arenas\" existed until after the 1917–18 season. The team at the time used no nickname; it was often referred to at the time as the \"Blueshirts\", the nickname of the NHA franchise, as it was announced by the NHA that the franchise had been sold, although Eddie Livingstone had not agreed to this as he wanted to resume his franchise or be compensated under his terms.\nToronto won the second half of the split regular season, while the Montreal Canadiens won the first half. Toronto then won the NHL title by defeating the Canadiens in a two-game, total-goals series, 10–7.\nMeanwhile, Vancouver finished the 1917–18 PCHA regular season in second place with a 9–9 record behind the 11–7 Seattle Metropolitans. However, Vancouver beat Seattle in that league's two-game, total-goals finals, 3–2, with a 1–0 game two victory.\nGame summaries.\nAs with the three previous NHA-PCHA Cup Final series, the series alternated between the NHL champion and the PCHA champion each year, while the differing rules for the leagues alternated each game. This meant that all of the games for the 1918 championship series were played at Toronto's Arena Gardens.\nTwo of the major differences between the two leagues' rules proved to be a major factor in the series. The PCHA allowed forward passing (adopted in the 1913–14 season) and played with seven players per side; the NHL did not adopt forward passing until the following season, and only played with six players. In every game, the winner was the one playing under its league's rules. The Torontos won Games 1 and 3 with victories of 5–3 and 6–3, and the Millionaires recorded 6–4 and 8–1 wins in Games 2 and 4. Because game five was played under NHL rules, it helped Toronto's Corbett Denneny to score the series winning goal in a 2–1 victory. The Torontos outscored the Millionaires by a combined total of 13–7 in the three games played under NHL rules. Conversely, Vancouver recorded a 14–5 margin in the games under PCHA rules.\nToronto goaltender Hap Holmes recorded a 4.20 goals-against average during the series, while Alf Skinner led Toronto with eight goals. Cyclone Taylor scored nine goals for Vancouver.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1918 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Arenas never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season.\nIt was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \"1918 Toronto Arenas\" was put onto its then-new collar.\nThe following Arenas players and staff were members of the Stanley Cup winning team.\n1917–18 Toronto Arenas"

        "title": "1919 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 1919 Stanley Cup Finals was the ice hockey playoff series to determine the 1919 Stanley Cup champions. The series was cancelled due to an outbreak of Spanish flu after five games had been played, and no champion was declared. It was the only time in the history of the Stanley Cup that it was not awarded due to a no-decision after playoffs were held.\nThe series was a rematch of the 1917 Stanley Cup Finals and the first since the armistice to end World War I. Hosting the series in Seattle was the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA) champion Seattle Metropolitans, playing against the National Hockey League (NHL) champion Montreal Canadiens. Both teams had won two games, lost two, and tied one before health officials were forced to cancel the deciding game of the series. Most of the Canadiens players and their manager George Kennedy fell ill with the flu and were hospitalized, leaving only three healthy players. The flu claimed the life of Canadiens defenceman Joe Hall four days later. Kennedy was terminally weakened by his illness, and it led to his death in 1921.\nPaths to the Finals.\nThe Canadiens won the first half of the 1918–19 NHL regular season while the Ottawa Senators won the second half, setting up a best-of-seven series between the two clubs to determine the NHL title. Montreal ended up winning the series, four games to one.\nMeanwhile, the Metropolitans finished the 1919 PCHA regular season in second place with an 11–9 record, behind the 12–8 Vancouver Millionaires. The two teams then faced off in a two-game total-goals championship series. Hours before the puck dropped for Game One, Metropolitans leading scorer Bernie Morris was arrested by United States authorities for alleged draft dodging. Without Morris, Seattle won game one 6–1 after Frank Foyston notched a hat trick, essentially ending the aggregate goals series. Vancouver recorded a 4–1 victory in game two, but lost the series to the Metropolitans by a combined score of 7–5. Morris was ultimately sentenced to two years hard labor at the U.S. Military Prison - Alcatraz, though his conviction was overturned after one year when he was granted an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army and sent straight to Ottawa for the 1920 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame summaries.\nAll of the games were held at the Seattle Ice Arena. As with previous Stanley Cup series, the differing rules for the leagues alternated each game. PCHA rules were to be used in games one, three, and five; and NHL rules were to be used in games two and four. The actual game five used NHL rules, as it was considered a replay of game four. \nSeattle dominated Montreal under PCHA rules, scoring two in the first, three in the second, and a further two in the third. Corbeau of Montreal was injured but finished the game and continued to play in the series as a substitute.\nThe Canadiens evened the series in game two with Newsy Lalonde scoring all of Montreal's goals. Montreal took the lead and never relinquished it, although Seattle scored two in 32 seconds in the third to make it close. Joe Hall took a puck to the nose on a deliberate play by Cully Wilson, but the rough tactics did not continue as Seattle tried to catch up.\nBack under PCHA rules, the Metropolitans won game three, 7–2. Seattle scored four goals in the first to take a commanding lead. No goals were scored in the second. In the third, Seattle prevented any comeback, outscoring Montreal 3–2.\nGame four has been considered one of the greatest hockey games ever played, ending in a scoreless tie after 20 minutes of overtime, with Seattle's Hap Holmes and Montreal's Georges Vézina blocking every shot. At the end of the first period, the Mets' Cully Wilson scored a goal, but Hall of Fame referee Mickey Ion waved it off, deciding it was scored just after he had blown the period's final whistle. Near the close of the second overtime, Berlinguette of Montreal had a chance to win it but missed by inches. Wilson of Seattle mixed it up with Berlinguette, who had to leave the ice. As players lay collapsed across the ice, the crowd gave both teams an ovation after the game in appreciation of the teams' play.\nBetween games four and five, discussions were made about which rules to use for game five. As game four had finished in a tie, the Canadiens wanted game five to be a replay of game four, using NHL rules, and Seattle wanted PCHA rules. The game was played under NHL rules, and it was agreed that in the future, teams would play overtime until a winning goal was scored.\nMontreal trailed in the game 3–0 after two periods, but Seattle tired, and Montreal scored three to force overtime. Lalonde had the Canadiens' second and third goals. In the extra period, Montreal's substitute Jack McDonald sprinted on the ice and tallied the game-winning goal in dramatic fashion after the Mets were down a player when Frank Foyston was injured, Jack Walker broke a skate, and Cully Wilson collapsed from exhaustion, leading the Canadiens to a 4–3 victory. The Metropolitans had only one substitute player, and the team was exhausted. On the last play, Cully Wilson went to the bench to be replaced by Frank Foyston. Foyston had scored nine of Seattle's 19 goals in the series, but by that point, he was unable to move and replace Wilson, leaving the team shorthanded while McDonald scored. Some players went to the hospital after the game, while others had to be carried home.\nCancellation.\nThe sixth and deciding game of the series was scheduled for April 1, but an outbreak of influenza caused several players on both teams to become seriously ill. With Lalonde, Hall, Coutu, Berlinguette, and McDonald of Montreal hospitalized or sick in bed, with fevers between 101 and 105 degrees Fahrenheit, game six was cancelled just five and a half hours before it was scheduled to start. Kennedy said he was forfeiting the Cup to Seattle, but Pete Muldoon, manager-coach of the Metropolitans, refused to accept the Cup in a forfeiture, seeing that it was catastrophic illness that had caused the Canadiens lineup to be short of players. Kennedy asked to use players from the Victoria team of the PCHA, but president Frank Patrick refused the request.\nFour days later, Joe Hall died of pneumonia brought about by the flu. His funeral was held in Vancouver on April 8, with most team members attending, and he was buried in Brandon, Manitoba. Manager George Kennedy also was stricken. His condition declined, and his wife arrived from Montreal to be with him. He never fully recovered from his symptoms and died 2 years later.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nNo official Stanley Cup winner was declared in 1919, and thus nothing was engraved onto the trophy. However, when the Cup was redesigned in 1948 and a new collar was added to include those teams that did not engrave their names on the trophy themselves, the following was added:\n1919&lt;br&gt;Montreal Canadiens&lt;br&gt;Seattle Metropolitans&lt;br&gt;Series Not Completed\nTeam rosters.\nMontreal Canadiens.\nSources: \nSeattle Metropolitans.\n† Morris did not play in the series due to his arrest for draft evasion.\n‡ Played rover position.\nSources:"

Margaret Smith Court's win in the singles was the first step towards her achieving a Grand Slam.\nTournament.\nEncouraged by Rod Laver's 1969 Grand Slam, Margaret Court successfully began her own Grand Slam campaign at the White City Stadium in Sydney, winning the Australian Open title without dropping a single set. She defeated fellow Australian Kerry Melville in the final 6–1, 6–3. Although the advent of the Open Era meant tournaments were now open to all tennis players the 1970 Australian Open men's competition was depleted by the absence of the world class players Rod Laver, Ken Rosewall, Andrés Gimeno, Pancho Gonzales, Roy Emerson and Fred Stolle. All these professional players were signed to the National Tennis League and were banned from entering the Australian Open because the financial guarantees were deemed unsatisfactory. The men's draw still had its memorable matches, not least in the quarterfinal when Dennis Ralston defeated local hero John Newcombe 19–17, 20–18, 4–6, 6–3 in the longest match (in games) in Australian Open history. The men's singles final between American Arthur Ashe and Australian Dick Crealy resulted in with Ashe winning his first and only Australian Open title in straight sets 6–4, 9–7, 6–2.

He played college football at North Carolina A&amp;T State University, where he was an all-conference player as a two-way lineman; he was also on the track team. \nIn 1960, he was one of the original draft picks of the new American Football League (AFL) Buffalo Bills franchise. However, he chose to play for the National Football League (NFL) St. Louis Cardinals instead, playing 10 games as an offensive guard, before being released the following year. He then played for the Bills, eventually transitioning to starting defensive end in 1964. He was part of a Bills' defense that did not allow a rushing touchdown for 17 consecutive games over a portion of the 1964 and 1965 seasons, winning the American Football League Championship in both years. Day said of winning the AFL championship, \"Winning the championship is like making love to the most beautiful woman in the world.\" He was an AFL All-Star in 1965. In March 1967, he was traded to the San Diego Chargers for running back Keith Lincoln. He played one season with the Chargers. After being cut the following year, he rejoined the Bills for his final season. Over nine seasons, he played 96 games with the Bills, 11 with the Chargers and 10 with the Cardinals.\nIn 1971, he was hired as a defensive line coach by the Bills, but when the head coach was replaced, Day was reassigned to scouting, lasting one year. \nFor his work helping indigent NFL former players, Day received the NFLPA Award of Excellence in 1997.\nHe worked in radio sales and as a youth counselor and a teacher in the Buffalo school system, before becoming a supervisor at Harrison Radiator in 1977. He worked there until his death at the age of 65. He was survived by his wife Joan, two daughters and a son."

        "text": "Beth Cunningham ( Morgan; born June 5, 1975), is the head coach of the Missouri State women's basketball team.\nCareer.\nShe was previously an associate head coach at Duke and Notre Dame and had been the women's basketball head coach at Virginia Commonwealth University and a former women's basketball player.\nAs Beth Morgan, she played for the University of Notre Dame, the Richmond Rage/Philadelphia Rage of the American Basketball League and the Washington Mystics of the WNBA before turning to coaching. She finished her playing career as one of the most decorated and top women's basketball players of all time.\nShe also played on the American teams in 1997 World University Games\n and the 1999 Pan-American Games.\nCunningham ranked as number 1 on Notre Dame's all-time scoring list with 2,322 points, until surpassed by Skylar Diggins. Diggins had played 17 more games than Cunningham did at Notre Dame. During her career, Cunningham set or tied 28 school records. In her final two seasons, she was a first team all-Big-East selection.\nCunningham took over the VCU Rams for the 2003–2004 season after serving as assistant coach of the team for two years. During her playing days at Notre Dame (1993-97), Cunningham was a trailblazer, leading the program to its first NCAA Women's Final Four appearance and a 31-7 campaign in her senior season. She was a two-time Associated Press and WBCA honorable mention All-America choice, four-time first-team all-conference selection and two-year team captain. The Irish were 97-32 in her four seasons, including a pair of conference titles and three NCAA appearances. She departed as the all-time leading scorer in Fighting Irish women's basketball history with 2,322 points (which now ranks third), having set or tied 28 school records during her career.\nShe was also a fixture in USA Basketball circles as both a player and coach, first suiting up for Team USA four times from 1996-99 (winning three medals including a gold at the 1997 USA World University Games) and later serving as the athlete representative on the USA Basketball Women's Junior National Team Committee and the USA Basketball Women's Collegiate Committee.\nFollowing her amateur career, Cunningham spent three seasons playing professional basketball, including two years with the Richmond/Philadelphia Rage of the American Basketball League (ABL) and one year with the WNBA's Washington Mystics in 2000 before embarking on her coaching career.\nHer father, Bob Morgan, was the head baseball coach at Indiana University for 22 years before retiring in 2005.\nPersonal life.\nShe married Dan Cunningham in 1998.

        "text": "The USC women's volleyball team is coached by Brad Keller, who was named to the position on February 20, 2020.\nUnder the last coach, Mick Haley, USC became the first repeat NCAA Volleyball National Champion to go undefeated, as they finished off 2003 with a record of 35–0 while becoming the first school in NCAA history to stay at number one in the coaches poll every week.\nHistory.\nThe program began in 1976. The first coach, Chuck Erbe, led the team to four national championships, 1 NCAA (1981) and three AIAW (1976–77, 1980).\nWomen's volleyball also has 10 final four appearances (1981, 1982, 1985, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2010, 2011), finishing as the National runner-up in 1982.\nMore recently, USC sent three female volleyball athletes to the 2008 Olympics – 2004 graduate Nicole Davis represented the indoor United States team, earning a silver medal. 2008 graduate Asia Kaczor represented her native Poland for indoor play, while 2006 alum Bibiana Candelas teamed up with Mayra García in beach volleyball, representing her native country, Mexico.\nYear by year highlights.\n1981.\n1981 was the first year the NCAA started sponsoring women's volleyball. USC, with a 26–10 record, defeated favored UCLA at Pauley Pavilion to win the first NCAA volleyball championship in NCAA history.\n2002–04.\nUSC won the program's second NCAA championship by defeating No. 2 and defending national champion Stanford 3–1. Keao Burdine was named the Most Outstanding Player.\nIn 2003, USC repeated as national champions. With a 35–0 record, the Women of Troy became the first repeat champion to go undefeated. USC defeated Florida 3–1 in the final.\nIn 2004, USC made its third consecutive final four, by upsetting No. 1 Nebraska in the regional final. In the national semifinals, the Women of Troy lost to No. 4 seeded Minnesota, the eventual national runners-up.\nUSC is the only school in the history of the AVCA Showcase tournament to win back-to-back AVCA Showcase titles, as the Women of Troy won in 2003 by defeating Hawaii and 2004 by defeating Minnesota.\n2007.\nUSC made its first final four since 2004, upsetting fourth-seeded Texas in the regional final. In the national semifinal, the Women of Troy nearly defeated top-seeded and eventual national runner-up Stanford, even having match point, but ended up losing the fifth set in extra points, 16–14. During the regular season, USC had beaten the Cardinal once.\n2010.\nStarting the season ranked tenth nationally, the Women of Troy compiled a 25–4 regular-season record, the eighth 25-win season in coach Haley's 10-year tenure. Notably, in the regular season USC recorded a sweep of crosstown rival UCLA in conference play, including a 3–2 margin in the last match before postseason play, avenging losses in both 2009 matches.\nThe Women of Troy dropped just one set through the first three rounds of the NCAA tournament before facing Stanford in the quarterfinal. Though the Cardinal had defeated USC in both regular-season matches, the Women of Troy edged Stanford in a five-setter, led by Falyn Fonoimoana's season-high 25 kills. It was USC's first win against Stanford in seven tries dating to 2007.\nDespite having won both regular season matches against Cal, the Women of Troy hit a season low .107 as a team—including a negative hitting percentage in the first set—and were swept, 3–0, in the semifinal. USC finished 29–5 on the season.\nVenues.\nThe North Gym, located in the USC Physical Education Building, was the team's home court from 1976 until 1988. From 1989 to 2006, the North Gym and the Lyon Center split time as the team's home court. In 2007, the team moved to the Galen Center as its home court, but uses the old venues if the Galen Center is reserved for other events."

        "title": "Wellington Rugby Football Union",
        "text": "The Wellington Rugby Football Union (known as the Wellington Lions for competition reasons) are a New Zealand governing body of rugby union in the New Zealand province of Wellington Region. The main stadium is Sky Stadium (formerly named Westpac Stadium) which is located in Wellington. The union also represents the Wellington Lions, which is professional rugby union team who compete in the Mitre 10 Cup competition and contest for the Ranfurly Shield. Before 2006 the Lions competed in the National Provincial Championship.\nSuper Rugby.\nPlayers from Wellington who are eligible to play in the Super Rugby generally play for the Hurricanes, and traditionally contribute the core of the Hurricanes squad. This position is largely due to the Wellington basing of the Hurricanes. Further, Manawatu and Hawke's Bay, two Hurricane provinces and prolific talent producers, had long been mired in the second half of the National Provincial Championship, allowing Wellington to lure the better players of these provinces with ease (Christian Cullen from Manawatu for example). The reorganisation of provincial rugby in 2006 brought all three provinces into the Mitre 10 Cup.\nNational Representative Rugby.\nThe senior Wellington representative team, the Wellington Lions play in the Mitre 10 Cup, which replaced the National Provincial Championship in 2006 as the Air New Zealand Cup. The Lions have won the provincial competition five times since its inception in 1976. The titles came in 1978, 1981, 1986, 2000 and 2022. They also won the second tier competition, the Championship, in 2017. Their colours are gold and black as shown on the Lions jersey. The Lions play their home games at the Sky Stadium (formerly named Westpac Stadium), previously playing at Athletic Park until 1999. Even with an All-Star backline in the late 1990s including Christian Cullen, Tana Umaga, Jonah Lomu and Alama Ieremia what was a superb team on paper never lived up to expectations and Wellington became known for its inconsistency. The Lions side have made it all the way to the grand final in seven times out of the last ten years (2004–2014), losing to Auckland in 2003, to Canterbury in 2004, to Waikato in 2006, Auckland in 2007, Canterbury in 2008, 2009 and most recently 2013. In 2014 Wellington lost a record nine straight losses and were relegated to the Mitre10 Cup Championship 2015. They won the Mitre10 Championship in 2017 over Bay of Plenty 59-45 to regain promotion to the Premiership in 2018.\nRanfurly Shield.\nThe Ranfurly Shield, colloquially known as the 'Log o' Wood', is perhaps the most prestigious trophy in New Zealand domestic rugby. First played for in 1904, the Ranfurly Shield is based on a challenge system, rather than a league or knockout competition as with most football trophies. The holding union must defend the Shield in home matches, and if a challenger defeats them, they become the new holder of the Shield.\nWellington won the first ever shield challenge winning it from Auckland in 1904 and defended it for 4 matches before losing it back to Auckland in 1905. It wouldn't be until 1914 when Wellington would get the shield back by winning it off Taranaki. This marked the longest time Wellington have held the shield successfully defending it for 15 matches until losing it again to Southland in 1920. They beat Southland a year later to regain the shield before promptly losing to Hawkes Bay after only 2 matches. Wellington held the shield for only one match in 1930 and after losing it to Canterbury they would not regain the shield until 1953. Up until the 1980s Wellington had short stints defending the shield but after losing it to Canterbury in 1982 it was to prove elusive. Wellington suffered 10 unsuccessful challenges for the Ranfurly Shield until they took it off Auckland in 2008, scoring five tries in a 27–0 victory, on the weekend of the Auckland Union's 125th anniversary.\nWellington lost the shield to Canterbury on 29 August, losing 36–14 at the then Westpac Stadium. Canterbury then held the shield for 4 defences (over 8 weeks) before losing to Southland on 22 October. It is currently held by Waikato who defeated Hawke's Bay on 9 October 2015 by 36–30.\nInternational matches.\nWellington has played a number of times against touring international rugby teams. Wellington drew with the British and Irish Lions in 1888 and beat them in 1908, 1930 and 1966\n. They have also played other international sides including South Africa, who were beaten in 1965. The Bill Freeman coached Wellington side defeated the Springboks 23–6, arguably the finest moment in Wellington rugby history.\nFull results for Wellington against international touring sides:\n1882 lost to New South Wales 2–14\n1882 lost to New South Wales 0–8\n1886 beat New South Wales 7–0\n1888 drew with British team 3–3\n1894 beat New South Wales 9–5\n1896 beat Queensland 49–7\n1901 beat New South Wales 17–16\n1905 beat Australia 23–7 (combined team with Wairarapa and Horowhenua\n1908 beat Anglo-Welsh 19–13\n1921 lost to South Africa 3–8\n1921 beat New South Wales 16–8\n1923 beat New South Wales 29–16 (combined team with Manawatu)\n1925 beat New South Wales 20–8 (combined team with Manawatu and Horowhenua)\n1930 beat British Lions 12–8\n1931 beat Australia 15–8\n1937 lost to South Africa 0–29\n1946 lost to Australia 15–16\n1950 lost to British Isles 6–12\n1956 lost to South Africa 6–8\n1959 lost to British Isles 6–21\n1963 lost to England 9–14\n1965 beat South Africa 23–6\n1966 beat British Isles 20–6\n1969 lost to Wales 6–14\n1971 lost to British Isles 9–47\n1973 beat England 25–16\n1975 lost to Scotland 25–36\n1977 lost to British Isles 6–13\n1979 lost to France 9–14\n1980 beat Fiji 24–8\nLocal club rugby.\nClub rugby is a large part of Wellington rugby. 18 clubs currently comprise the Wellington union and all contribute at least one team to the club competitions. The premier trophy in Wellington club rugby is the Jubilee Cup, which was won in 2012 by Marist St Pat's. Petone are the club with the most Jubilee Cup successes having won the title 22 times.\nYears in parentheses are when the current club was formed, though many are amalgamations of previously extant clubs. For example, Oriental-Rongotai claim their heritage back to the formation of the Oriental club in 1888 even though the current club was formed in 1969.\nWellington FC is New Zealand's oldest continuous club.\nWellington club rugby is contested over the following grades, following a change to the structure:\nRemaining grades include age-restricted (Under 21 years), weight-restricted (Under 85 kg), Reserve grade, and the non-competition presidents grade.\nHigh School rugby is organised by College Sport Wellington, with open-age/weight (Premier), weight-restricted (Under 80 kg, 65 kg, and 55 kg), and age-restricted (Under 15 years) for boys, and an open Girls grade. Each grade then comprises several divisions.\nChampionship Winners.\nWellington Senior Club Championship Winners since 1880:\nThe Jubilee Cup has been played for since 1929, with the winners being:\nJersey.\nMain sponsor is Stonewood Homes. Apparel is supplied by Paladin. Other major sponsors include:\nWomen's Rugby.\nWellington has a women's team that are part of the Women's Provincial Championship, called the Wellington Pride. Wellington Pride is the only team aside from Auckland to have won the Women's Championship."

        "text": "The 1977 Wimbledon Championships was a tennis tournament that took place on the outdoor grass courts at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London, United Kingdom. The tournament ran from 20 June until 2 July. It was the 91st staging of the Wimbledon Championships, and the third Grand Slam tennis event of 1977.\nCentenary celebrations.\nOn the opening day of the tournament, Monday 20 June, to celebrate the centenary of the first Gentlemen's Singles event, former singles champions were presented with a medal by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Katharine, Duchess of Kent on Centre Court. Those attending were: Kitty Godfree, Jean Borotra, René Lacoste, Henri Cochet, Jack Crawford, Sidney Wood, Fred Perry, Dorothy Round, Don Budge, Alice Marble, Yvon Petra, Jack Kramer, Bob Falkenburg, Ted Schroeder, Budge Patty, Dick Savitt, Margaret duPont, Frank Sedgman, Louise Brough, Vic Seixas, Doris Hart, Jaroslav Drobný, Tony Trabert, Shirley Irvin, Lew Hoad, Chuck McKinley, Ashley Cooper, Maria Bueno, Alex Olmedo, Neale Fraser, Angela Barrett, Rod Laver, Karen Susman, Roy Emerson, Billie Jean King, Manuel Santana, John Newcombe, Ann Jones, Evonne Goolagong Cawley, Stan Smith, Jan Kodeš, Arthur Ashe, Chris Evert and Björn Borg. Jacques Brugnon and Elizabeth Ryan were invited to represent all of the doubles champions. Ryan won a total of 19 doubles titles, a record that remains to date. Jimmy Connors (who was the number one seed for the tournament) did not attend the event, choosing instead to practise with Ilie Năstase at the time of the ceremony. This apparent snub by the American earned him harsh booing from the Centre Court crowd when he appeared to play his first round match the following day. The All England Club responded to media enquiries when Major David Mills, the secretary, issued this terse statement: \"Medals will be sent only to former champions who indicated they could not be here, and not to those who were here and had the extreme discourtesy not to collect it.\".\nTo commemorate the centenary of the event, all former singles champions were offered a place in the main draw by the All England Club. Several former singles champions (some of whom had been retired) competed in the championships as a result.

        "title": "BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars",
        "text": "BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars is a class of single-seater stock-car-racing in the UK with custom-built cars, with races conducted on walled oval tracks of either shale or tarmac of approximately a quarter-mile in length. The cars follow open wheel design principles, and there are no horsepower restrictions for the engines. Drivers may use any engine they choose, with Chevrolet based small or big block V8 engines being the most popular. The season runs from March through to November, with occasional meetings over the Christmas period.\nAdministration.\nBriSCA (British Stock Car Association) F1 Stock Cars are governed by the BriSCA Management Board, comprising three members of the association of promoters (BriSCA) and three members of the BSCDA (British Stock Car Drivers Association) together with an independent secretary. Rules and regulations relating to car specifications, race procedures, track requirements and all other aspects of the sport are updated annually by the BriSCA Management Board. All drivers wishing to race at a BriSCA F1 meeting have to be registered in advance by the BSCDA. All venues that stage BriSCA F1 racing must be licensed by BriSCA.\nHistory.\nBriSCA F1 Stock Car racing can trace its roots to the first stock car race in United Kingdom, which was held at New Cross Stadium in London on Good Friday, 16 April 1954, promoted by a Northampton-born Australian showman called Digger Pugh. It was a considered successful with two further meetings taking place at New Cross before the next meeting took place at Odsal Stadium, Bradford, on 26 May 1954. The new craze spread rapidly around the country and was dubbed the \"seven day wonder\". Originally, the cars were slightly modified saloon cars, hence the term \"stock\" as opposed to \"race\" cars. Most of the cars were American models with V8 engines, with some larger European cars. The cars were standard makes with wheel arches removed, and with bumpers added along with roll bars.\nIn 1956 the drivers' association was formed. In 1957, thanks to the efforts of Peter Arnold, a national numbering system was introduced, BriSCA, the association of promoters was formed and the Stock Car Racing Board of Control created. There was also an agreement that BriSCA would only use drivers of the drivers' association. From the initial explosion in 1954 things started to settle down, tracks opened and closed but racing rules were introduced and the cars became more refined, while star drivers started to emerge. BriSCA has raced continuously since 1954 and held over 5,500 meetings across the United Kingdom.\nIn 1975, about 30 southern based drivers broke away from BriSCA and formed their own association called SCOTA (Stock Car Oval Track Association). They were disappointed at the lack of F1 meetings being held in the south of the country. They raced for promoter Spedeworth in cars exactly the same as BriSCA F1. In 1978 it was renamed F1SCA (Formula One Stock Car Association). In 1980, F1SCA decided to introduce a five-litre limit, and make the cars slightly smaller. Renamed 'Formula 80' the cars ran until 2018 under the name 'Spedeworth V8 Stock Cars'.\nIn 2019 the Spedeworth V8 Stock Cars separated from all racing governing bodies and became an outlaw group. They now race as the 'V8 Stock Cars Tour' and race at tracks wherever they are welcome. In 2023 the sport has seen the addition of new drivers moving from the BriSCA V8 Hot Stox formula to the V8 Outlaw Tour. \nCurrently BriSCA F1 are governed by the British Stock Car (promoters) Association, ORCi, and Spedeworth International.\nCars.\nDuring the 1960s, the cars developed from stock road cars into specially built cars with fabricated chassis and race-tuned V8 engines. While NASCAR in the US also races specially-built race cars, they retain the appearance of a road car, unlike the BriSCA F1 which now bears no resemblance to a road car.\nA modern BriSCA F1 configuration is front-engined, rear-wheel drive, and open-wheeled, with the driver located centrally. The cars are constructed on race engineered steel ladder chassis with robust roll-over-safety cages and aluminium sheet body panelling, There is no limit in engine capacity or number of cylinders but engines must be naturally aspirated (no fuel injection, no supercharging or turbo charging permitted) and the engine blocks must be cast iron. The most common engines used, due to their reliability and availability, are based on the American Chevrolet V8 engine in both small block (350 ci) 5.7 litre and big block (454 ci) 7.4 litre varieties, producing upwards of 740 bhp with approximately 640 ft-lbs of torque but some cars are known to have been equipped with engines of 9 litre capacity (540 ci). Power is most typically delivered through a 'Doug Nash' style gearbox with two forward gears (one for racing) and reverse, and use a heavily modified Ford Transit rear axle with a locked differential.\nThe cars use 'American Racer' control tyres on the outside rear. The cars are also restricted in what dampers can be used, to control costs. Cars can reach speeds of 80–90 mph around a quarter-mile oval, so most cars use large roof mounted aerofoils, similar to those found on American sprint cars, to create downforce on the corners and provide some extra cornering grip. Wings are not compulsory, and the benefit is not proven.\nCars must weigh between 1,350 and 1,500 kg and due to always racing anticlockwise, the cars are limited to having a maximum of 52% of the weight on the left hand side of the car when viewed from the rear. Cars are weighed at each meeting to make sure they conform to this rule.\nMany drivers use two separate cars; one set up primarily for use on shale or dirt ovals, while the other car will be set up for tarmac or asphalt ovals. However, a few drivers with limited budgets may optimise just one car for both surface types, changing various components for each different track and surface.\nGrading of drivers.\nEach driver is graded according to past results, their roof or wing painted accordingly. Red roofs with amber flashing lights are known as 'superstar' grade; then red (star), blue ('A' grade), yellow ('B' grade) and white ('C' grade). Every month during the season, the list is recompiled based on points scored at that month's meetings, and drivers move up and down according to their latest position. There are restrictions on movement down the grades based on limited meetings raced at, and the previous highest grade reached. Novice drivers for their first three meetings are allowed to start at the back of the grid and show a black saltire on the rear cab panel, so that other drivers know to avoid deliberate contact with the new driver.\nChampionship winners are designated specific roof colours: gold for the world champion, silver for the national points champion, black and white checks for the British champion, and red and yellow checks for the European champion. If one driver wins more than one title, roof colours will be a combination of whatever titles have been won.\nIn stock car terminology, the roof colour will also be known as the 'top'; for example, cars with a white roof will be known as a 'white top' whereas a star driver will be termed a 'red top.'\nDrivers are always referred to by their racing number and name, for example ‘53’ John Lund. Drivers tend to carry their racing number throughout their careers. If they win the world championship they can choose to race as number '1' until the next world championship.\nRaces.\nBriSCA F1 Stock Car races are normally held on short, approximately quarter-mile, oval tracks, either tarmac or shale. Heats usually consist of 16 laps, with meeting finals lasting 20 laps. Special events (such as the world final) are held over 25 laps.\nThe race line up is unique in that best drivers start at the rear of the field. The lowest, 'C' graded, drivers start each race at the front, then 'B', 'A' and 'star', while the 'superstars' start each race from the rear of the field. Championship races are usually gridded in qualifying order, with the highest qualifiers starting at the front of the grid.\nThe number of competitors at a meeting will usually aim to be around 60. The meetings usually consist of three heats (20 cars in each), a consolation race, a final and a grand national. The first eight from the heats qualify for the final. Those who do not qualify from the heats can race in the consolation race and the first six qualify for the final. The final usually consists of 30 cars, and the grand national race is open to all, with the winner of the final, if racing, given a one-lap handicap. If the number of cars racing is lower, around 40 cars, they can split the cars into a two-thirds format. Each driver races in two heats, with a compilation of points deciding who races in the final.\nThe grand national is an all-season competition with the points collected resulting in a one-off race at the end of the season for the ‘grand national champion’\nUse of contact.\nStock car racing in the UK is often confused with banger racing where cars deliberately crash into each other. However, stock cars employ more subtle forms of contact where, typically, just enough force is employed to move the car in front wide to facilitate overtaking.\nRace signals.\nRaces are carefully monitored by track marshals placed at intervals around the track and the individual known as the 'Starter', positioned on a rostrum at the start/finish line who issues instructions to competing drivers via a system of flags. Additionally, traffic light signals are placed at suitable positions around the raceway.\nWorld Championship.\nThe World Championship is an annual competition and the premier stock car championship. The winner is granted the honour of racing with a gold roof and wing until the next World Final and may choose to race under number 1. The World Final is usually held in September. The host tracks, all of which are based in the UK, are chosen by the designated promoter.\nThe grid for the World Final is composed of drivers from the UK who are chosen through a series of qualifying rounds and two World Championship semi-finals. Drivers who fail to progress from the semi-finals may race again in a consolation semi-final to choose two more entrants, and the reigning world champion is entitled to start at the rear of the grid if they have not already qualified. The UK drivers are joined by stock car drivers from the Netherlands, and by invited drivers in the nearest equivalent motorsport formulas from other countries often including Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and the USA.\nThe most successful driver in world final races is John Lund, who has won eight. Other notable multiple winners include 391 Stuart Smith (six), 391 Andy Smith (five), 33 Peter Falding (four), 103 Johnny Brise, 252 Dave Chisholm , 515 Frankie Wainman Junior (three) 84 Tom Harris (three).\nNational Points Championship.\nThe National Points Championship is a season-long competition. The winner is granted the honour of racing with a silver roof for the following season.\nThe first season-long championship started in 1956. Drivers' scores at every stock car meeting were recorded to create the championship table. During the late 1990s, when Frankie Wainman Junior dominated, there was criticism that the National Points Championship was predictable and favoured drivers who had the money to race at as many meetings as possible. The National Series was created in 2002. Rather than the points accumulated over the entire season counting towards the winner, the National Series was competed for over 35 designated meetings. The season-long National Points Championship survived, but its importance was downgraded, and the privilege of racing with a silver roof for the following season was transferred from it to the National Series.\nIn 2009, the National Series was amended. This time, the top ten points-scoring drivers over the first two-thirds of the season were entered in the National Series Shootout, beginning with no points except for a small number of meeting attendance points. The drivers raced over ten designated shootout rounds, with the points scored in them deciding the winner of the National Series. In 2010, the number of competing drivers was increased to twelve. From 2012, the National Series Shootout was rebranded the National Points Championship Shootout.\nThe most successful driver in National Points Championships and National Series is 515 Frankie Wainman Junior, who has won fourteen. Other notable multiple winners include 391 Stuart Smith (thirteen), 53 John Lund (six), 38 Fred Mitchell (three), 391 Andy Smith (three) and 212 Frankie Wainman (three).\nSpectating.\nCars, drivers and their pit crews can be accessed, approached and watched while they prepare or repair cars between races, with drivers generally being happy to allow children to sit on or in their cars for photographs as well as to discuss how their racing is progressing.\nTracks.\nThe active UK tracks where BriSCA F1 stock cars race are:\nBoth Cowdenbeath and Lochgelly stage meetings biannually. \nOutside the UK:\nAlthough not part of the official BriSCA calendar, BriSCA F1 drivers also occasionally compete at Emmen, Texel, St Maarten, Blauwhuis and Lelystad in the Netherlands and Warneton in Belgium.\nDefunct tracks.\nThe following tracks no longer host BriSCA F1. Some have been demolished, others continue to hold meetings for other formulae including BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars, Superstox and bangers:\nBig tracks:\nMedia.\nThe 1980s saw BriSCA F1 Stock Cars on national television, featured on ITV's \"World of Sport\". During 2009, the BBC filmed an F1 Stock Car season almost in its entirety to produce a six-part television documentary titled \"Gears and Tears\" which featured the bitter battle between the two dominant clans in the sport, the Yorkshire-based Wainmans and the Lancashire-based Smiths. Over the nine-month season the film makers enjoyed unprecedented behind the scenes access. From 2011, satellite television channel Premier Sports began broadcasting selected meetings. Since September 2017, FreeSports (Freeview, FreeSat) have broadcast BriSCA F1 meetings with no payment to view required.\nPC simulation.\nSimulation of BriSCA F1 stock car (and other oval formulas) racing can be played on a PC via specially created 'mods', which exist for both the \"Nascar Heat\" and \"rFactor\" motor racing simulation game engines. \"rFactor\" requires a relatively recent PC specification. Racing can be simulated either off-line (against computer controlled cars) or on-line, with some organised racing leagues existing that mimic the real life racing fixture list and drivers in the leagues may opt to use replicas of real life cars or personalised 'skins' created using popular graphical editing tools. Accurately modelled stock car tracks that are either current or defunct may be downloaded for the modifications allowing for contemporary or nostalgic racing.\nThere is also a game on Xbox One called Stockcars Unleashed 2. It uses real car liveries, drivers and UK ovals and a championship racing format."

        "text": "The Harrisburg Senators were an American basketball team based in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, that was originally formed as a member of the American Basketball League, where it played for one season.\nFrom 1947 to 1951, the Harrisburg Senators played in the Eastern Professional Basketball League. Without a true basketball arena available at the time, the Senators split their games between the Madrid Palestra and the Zembo Mosque, two buildings that were large enough to hold a court and bleachers. During that time, the team's leading scorer was Joe Cackovic. The franchise reached the EPBL finals in both the 1948–49 and 1949–50 seasons.\nChange from Harrisburg Senators to Harrisburg Caps.\nThe Senators had trouble filling the huge Zembo Mosque during the 1950–51 season, and visiting teams complained that the basketball floor at the mosque was often waxed for dance halls, and that the Senators applied rosin on their shoes to countermand the slippery surface. The franchise folded midway through the 1950–51 season and was replaced by another franchise, the Harrisburg Caps, who finished out the Senators' season. After sitting out the 1951–52 season, the Caps returned to the EPBL and played their home games at the Madrid Palestra. The 1952–53 Caps' lineup was strengthened by the addition of four players from the Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania Army base, who played for both the military team and for the Caps. But with the season winding down and the Caps mistakenly believing they had been eliminated from the playoffs, the Fort Indiantown Gap players quit the team and the Caps were forced to use semipro hoopsters to finish out the final two contests."

        "text": "The Forest Rugby Club was established in 1958, to serve the community, not only as a rugby club but also to assist in the development of the youth in The Forest area. The club has grown dramatically since its inception and now fields junior teams from U6's to U17's.\nThe senior club has become one of NSW strongest and now fields 6 senior teams in the NSW Suburban Rugby Union 1st Division Kentwell Cup. The Kentwell Cup is the second tier of club Rugby and is a Sydney wide competition.\nHistory.\nIn 1957 the Forest Rugby story began when a small group of men from the Frenchs Forest area, who used to meet for a drink after work in a Chatswood Hotel, decided they would like their sons to play rugby. As there was no organised rugby in the area, one of the fathers Bill Holmes, formed a team of boys to enter the Gordon, Northern Districts competition. The team was coached by Dick Healy and managed by Bill Holmes and Les Cowan.\nBy 1958 the number of players, officials and supporters increased and it was decided to form a club. The first meeting was held in Soldiers Hall, Forestville on 10 February 1958. The club's colours of Bottle Green and White were chosen. The home ground would be French's Forest Primary School Oval.\nThroughout the 60's the club progressed further by drafting and having accepted a constitution, increasing their junior teams to 14 and re-locating to the permanent home ground of The War Memorial Playing Fields, Melwood Oval, Forestville. Notably, in 1966 the club's numbers had grown to 300 with 16 teams being fielded and Peter Sullivan being the first player from the club to be selected to play for NSW (and later went on to captain Australia).\nIn 1972 the club entered its first team in the Sydney Sub-District Competition where they stayed until 1979 where they were invited to join the newly formed 3rd Division. After several years of playing in the higher division it was decided to return to Sub-District competition in 1982 after difficulty fielding teams in all 4 grades due to the vast amount of traveling involved.\nThe club has been a centre of community activity throughout the 80's, 90's and into the millennium staging junior rugby training camps, golden oldies tournaments and fierce and competitive local rugby."

        "title": "Basketball in England",
        "text": "Basketball has a very long history in England, being introduced there by YMCA almost immediately after it was invented (having been created by the Canadian Dr. James Naismith in 1891 in Massachusetts). World Wars I and II further spurred its popularity.\nThe four highest profile team sports in the United Kingdom are football, cricket, rugby union and rugby league. Basketball belongs to the next tier alongside ice hockey and netball; like these sports, it has a significant and dedicated following, a professional league, but attracts little coverage from the major British media outlets and suffers from lack of \"crossover\" appeal. While England is the birthplace of the four main sports, and England teams are relatively major powers in each of them, Basketball, like ice hockey, is essentially an \"import\" from North America, and English and British teams have not generally been successful in them internationally, which also affects their profile.\nThe elite league is the fully professional British Basketball League, featuring teams from England and Scotland, while the semi-professional National Basketball League effectively forms the second-tier. There is no promotion and relegation between the two leagues because the BBL operates a franchise system whereby teams have to \"buy into\" the league.\nHistory.\nIntroduced by YMCA.\nBasketball was first introduced in England between March 1892 and January 1893 by the president of Birkenhead YMCA, C.J. Proctor, who had observed the game during a business trip to Canada. This introduction of the game led to a growth in participation in the new game of basketball initially as an internal league played at Birkenhead YMCA members (England's first Central Venue League), and later to other YMCA clubs in the Wirral and Merseyside regions.\nIn June 1894 Mel Rideout, a participant in the first game at Springfield College, introduced the game at a YMCA Convention held in England. This did not lead to a wider take up of the game.\nBirkenhead initiative remained a local development until 1911 when a YMCA instructor brought basketball to Birmingham YMCA, and a team was produced. Within a few months teams had sprung up in the district playing one another in friendly matches. The American Rules had been introduced, but the teams in Birmingham found them to be too complicated, and when forming a Local Basketball Association, they compiled a more practical set of rules for their own use.\nThe use of YMCA instructors from Springfield College gave a direct link to the origins of the game. Within a short time after the Birmingham Development many YMCA clubs in England had adopted the game and had formed District Associations similar to the Association in Birmingham. Most of these Associations found the same difficulty of complication in the American Rules and in 1912 the Birmingham Association Rules of Basketball were accepted throughout most of England with some slight differences in rules according to particular conditions.\nWorld War I and the inter-war years.\nMany Inter-Clubs and Inter-YMCA. games were played until in 1914 with the start of World War I a large number of young men left their home towns for France. Basketball naturally lost a great deal of its initial impetus and although many games were played during the War years the development was limited.\nWith the arrival of the Americans into the War in 1917, many keen British basketball players, found out more about the game and in 1918 an American YMCA Physical Director brought some influence to bear on the District Associations in England, with the result that the local rules were altered slightly and the game became more like the American game. The game was influenced greatly by American forces in Europe during and after World War I and many European Countries as a result began to play Basketball. Britain continued to be influenced during this period, and YMCA clubs developed the game with added flavour. Rules, however, continued to vary according to the country in which the game was played and this state was to continue for a great number of years.\nIn 1924 basketball was included as a demonstration game at the Paris Olympic Games. Great Britain was successfully represented in this Tournament by a team from the London Central YMCA who won all their games. The London Central YMCA (also written about as CentYMCA Harriers in the Dutch press) were reigning National YMCA Champions this championship having been established in 1922. One of the players from the victorious YMCA team introduced the game to the Netherlands, i.e. A.M.V.J. Amsterdam in 1929. In his honour there still is to this day a tournament called after him, the Lew Lake tournament organized by the first Dutch basketball club, AMVJ Amsterdam, founded in January 1930. Still today Lew Lake is honoured in the Dutch basketball world as the first one to give basketball demonstrations and teach the game in Holland.\nAMVJ organized an international basketball tournament in March 1932, the first international games in the Netherlands. Teams from Belgium, Lille, Holland and CentYMCA took part. Centymca ended second after Olympique Lille.\nThe game continued to develop in England and in 1936 a meeting was called at the London Central YMCA to form a Governing Body for the sport. The new Association, the Amateur Basket Ball Association of England and Wales (ABBA.) was established with Mr. Herbert Naylor, the National Physical Director of YMCA in England as chairman, Mr. J. A. Clay of Birmingham as Honorary Secretary and Mr. W. Browning as London Area Secretary.\nTo run the Association England was divided into four areas:\nA Divisional Secretary was appointed in each area. The game continued to spread in England as it was doing worldwide. Prior to 1936 basketball had been included in the Far Eastern Olympics held in Japan each year.\nMany new faces appeared in Basketball in England. Mr. George Williams of London presented a cup to the ABBA, as Senior Championship Cup and the first tournament for the cup was staged in Birmingham on 6 June 1936. The finalists in this Knockout Championship Tournament were Hoylake YMCA and London Polytechnic. The former winning the 1st Championships of England and Wales by 32 points to 21 points.\nGreater interest was taken in Basketball because of the incentive of the Championships and many more teams affiliated to ABBA the following year. The standard of play also improved and on 19 March 1938, Hoylake YMCA (the 1937 winners) were opposed by Latter Day Saints. This game won by Hoylake YMCA was the first game to be broadcast on radio with a running commentary being given during the final.\nThe George Williams Trophy played for by the teams in this competition is still used today for EB's premier Championship Competition.\nHoylake YMCA in October 1937 represented England in the Tournament at a Paris Competition - the first International team to play for England.\nDuring 1937, Basketball had increased in popularity, not only with senior players, but also with the younger members. Junior games were played extensively and in 1938 ABBA organised on similar lines to the Senior Championships a National Junior Championship of England and Wales. Plaistow YMCA presented the ABBA with a Challenge Cup. On 9 April 1938 the first Junior Championship Final was held in Birmingham between Ton Pentre (Rhondda Valley) Boys' Club and London Polytechnic with the Welsh Club winning the first tournament.\nOn the 18th, 19th, and 20 April 1938 basketball was included along with the European Roller Speed Skating Championships the Semi Finals and Finals of the Basketball Championship of England and Wales. In the Final, the Catford Saints beat Rochdale Greys 61 points to 47 points. The standard of play in this Championship showed considerable improvement. On the day following the Championship Finals Catford Saints represented England in the first International match ever held in Britain. The game against Germany was won by England by 40 points to 35 points.\nOn 22/23 October 1938 a composite England International Team competed in the International Basketball Tournament at the Sports Palace in Berlin. The team with Mr. W. Browning as Coach and Mr. J. Clay as Manager included three Birmingham players - F. Cole, C. Hunt and A. J. Lee, four London players - F. Gibson. R. Bradley, A. Hants, M. Ashton. and also F. Allen (Rochdale) and G. McMinn (Manchester). This was the first time a composite International Team had travelled abroad and this in itself showed the development of English Basketball. Birmingham and London Area supplied the majority of those International players in keeping with the level of the development of Basketball in England.\nABBA of England and Wales, had, gone all out to attract the public, with success. Basketball was now being played extensively in most areas of England and Wales and the public seemed to be interested. In February 1939 a London National League was started involving 6 teams playing in a League Competition at Haringey Arena.\nWorld War II.\nEnglish Basketball was progressing very well indeed and by including \"Catford Saints\" as the English team (1939 Championship Winners) in the Liège Festival that year, the ABBA once more made England's position in European Basketball felt. It is unfortunate for the progress of Basketball that World War II started in the latter part of 1939.\nA Championship Final was held in April 1940 with the Birmingham Athletic Institute (BAI) beating London Central YMCA in this final. Due to the war there was no Championship for the next six years and thus Birmingham retained the Trophy for that period.\nThe War, although stemming the development of the actual number of clubs in Britain, did have a good effect upon the game. The Army adopted the game and a number of Army teams were started. The Army influenced the other services and Inter-Service Tournaments were started.\nMany novices at basketball were introduced to a better class of play and coaching in the services. With the fall of the European Countries, many service personnel from these countries came to Britain, included in the Polish and French services contained some very keen basketball players, these people helped in the development of the game in the Forces.\nIn 1942/43, with the arrival of American forces, a further impetus to the growth of the game was given and their influence on the game in Britain continued for many years after the War.\nPresent.\nBasketball struggles to get funding, but there are still two leagues (the British Basketball League and the National Basketball League (England). The latter covers divisions 2, 3, and 4. There are also several amateur local leagues across the UK."

It was held between March 21 and 29, 1986, and concluded with Michigan State defeating Harvard 6-5. All Quarterfinals matchups were held at home team venues while all succeeding games were played at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island.\nQualifying teams.\nThe NCAA permitted 8 teams to qualify for the tournament and divided its qualifiers into two regions (East and West). Each of the tournament champions from the four Division I conferences (CCHA, ECAC, Hockey East and WCHA) received automatic invitations into the tournament with At-large bids making up the remaining 4 teams, 1 from each conference.\nFormat.\nThe tournament featured three rounds of play. The two odd-number ranked teams from one region were placed into a bracket with the two even-number ranked teams of the other region. The teams were then seeded according to their ranking. In the Quarterfinals the first and fourth seeds and the second and third seeds played two-game aggregate series to determine which school advanced to the Semifinals. Beginning with the Semifinals all games were played at the Providence Civic Center and all series became Single-game eliminations. The winning teams in the semifinals advanced to the National Championship Game with the losers playing in a Third Place game."

The voting panel select a list of nominees who can then be voted for by players, coaches, media representatives and the public via Twitter. Informed by the vote, the panel then select the winner. the voting panel comprises John Smit, George Gregan, Melodie Robinson, Maggie Alphonsi, Clive Woodward, Brian O'Driscoll, Richie McCaw, Thierry Dusautoir and Fiona Coghlan.\nThe first winner of the award was Ireland hooker Keith Wood. The winner for 2022 was Ireland's Josh van der Flier. New Zealand players have received the most awards, winning ten times. Two players have won three times – flanker Richie McCaw (2006, 2009 and 2010) and fly-half Dan Carter (2005, 2012 and 2015). Nominations for the award are dominated by players from Tier 1 nations; only United States' Joe Taufete'e has ever been nominated from a Tier 2 side.

        "title": "Competition climbing",
        "text": "Competition climbing is a form of regulated rock climbing competition held indoors on purpose-built artificial climbing walls (earlier versions were held on external natural rock surfaces). The three competition climbing disciplines are lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing. The result of multiple disciplines can be used in a \"combined\" format to determine an all-round winner (or the \"combined\" winner). Competition climbing is sometimes called \"sport climbing\", which is the name given to pre-bolted lead climbing.\nIn competition lead climbing, competitors start at the bottom of a pre-bolted sport climbing route to reach the highest hold possible within a set time limit on a single attempt, making sure to clip the rope into pre-placed quickdraws while ascending. In competition bouldering, competitors climb short problems without a rope, with an emphasis on the number of problems completed, and the attempts necessary to do so. In competition speed climbing, competitors climb a standardised route using a top rope, in the shortest time possible.\nThe International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) regulates and organizes the international competition climbing events, including the biennial IFSC Climbing World Championships, and the annual IFSC Climbing World Cup that is held as a series of events during the year. Competition climbing was featured at the Summer Olympics for the first time in 2020, in a once-off single combined format per gender, with the results based on a combination of lead climbing, bouldering, and speed climbing performances. The format for climbing at the 2024 Olympics has speed climbing as a standalone event, although lead and boulder are still a combined event.\nHistory.\nCompetition climbing dates from the arrival of sport climbing in the mid-1980s, which is a type of rock climbing where the climbing protection is pre-bolted into the climbing route, so the climber does not have to worry about their safety while ascending. Some were reticent about the ethics of competitive climbing, and in early 1985, several leading climbers signed the , rejecting the concept. However, later in 1985, the first internationally recognized competition climbing event was held at Sportroccia, which later became the annual Rock Master competition. These were annual lead climbing competitions held outdoors on natural rock surfaces and their first winners were Stefan Glowacz, Patrick Edlinger and Catherine Destivelle.\nIn 1988–89, the French Federation and Paul Brasset convinced the UIAA to regulate and administer competition climbing; it was agreed that events would be held on indoor artificial climbing walls. In 1989, the first UIAA Climbing World Cup was held over seven events around the world. In 1991, the first biennial UIAA World Climbing Championships was held in Frankfurt. In 1992, the first UIAA Climbing World Youth Championships was held in Basel. In 1998, bouldering and speed climbing were added alongside lead climbing for UIAA competition climbing events. In 2005, competition climbing was added to the World Games. In 2006-07, the UIAA ceded governance of competition climbing to a newly formed International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) that received provisional recognition by the International Olympic Committee.\nIn August 2016, the IOC announced that competition climbing would be a sport in the 2020 Summer Olympics, but that lead, boulder, and speed would be combined into a single medal event; this caused upset however it allowed the maximum number of disciplines to feature at the Olympics. During August 3–6, 2021, Alberto Ginés López and Janja Garnbret won the first-ever men's and women's Olympic climbing gold medals at the Tokyo Olympics, in the newly created combined event consisting of all three disciplines.\nAfter the Tokyo Olympics, it was announced that the 2024 Paris Olympics would only combine lead climbing and bouldering into a single medal event, with speed climbing split out into a standalone medal event.\nDisciplines.\nCompetition lead climbing.\nIn competition lead climbing, the competitors have 6 minutes to climb a challenging, and usually significantly overhanging, pre-bolted sport climbing route (with pre-placed quickdraws for their protection), which was constructed by a route setter. For the safety of the competitors, they must also clip their safety rope into the various quickdraws (that are attached to the bolts) while they ascend the route; failing to clip into a quickdraw terminates their climb at that position.\nIn the wider sport of rock climbing, pre-bolted lead climbing routes are known as sport climbs (in contrast to traditional climbing, where the climber places the protection equipment), confusingly however, \"competition climbing\" is sometimes also called \"sport climbing\", even though it also has bouldering and speed climbing.\nThe climber is allowed one single attempt at the route. Their score on the route is determined by the highest artificial hold number that they \"controlled\" before falling (i.e. all the artificial holds on the wall are numbered, starting with 1 at the bottom); if in addition, they had \"used\" that hold to make a controlled movement for the next hold before falling, a \"+\" is added to their score. For example, falling while secured on hold 34, while reaching for hold 35, earns a score of \"34+\".\nBetween rounds, the competitors are collectively given 6 minutes to inspect — but not attempt or practice — the next route. After the brief inspection, they are kept in an isolation area to prevent them from observing other competitors on the route and collecting its beta (which would help them to flash the route); they are thus effectively lead climbing the artificial route as an onsight, which is the most difficult way to ascend a new route.\nCompetition bouldering.\nIn competition bouldering, the competitors have to \"solve\" multiple short bouldering problems over a set time period, with the fewest falls. In contrast to lead climbing, these boulder problems are more complex, but each boulder problem can be attempted multiple times – with repeated falls – within a certain time limit (usually 5 minutes in qualifiers and 4 minutes in finals). As in all bouldering, the competitors do not use a rope or any climbing protection, but crash pads that are laid across the ground for safety.\nEach individual boulder problem has an official start position with proscribed positions for all four of the competitor's limbs at the base of the problem. The competitor is judged to have completed the boulder problem when they have placed their two hands on the explicitly marked \"top\" hold and held it long enough to receive confirmation from the judge. In addition to the top hold, \"zone holds\" are located at the mid-point of the problem, which if secured, earn a half point, in lieu of failing to earn a full point by \"topping\".\nAs with competition lead climbing, the competitors cannot see each other's attempts which would help them to learn route's beta. The climber's score is determined by the overall number of routes \"topped\", the most \"zone holds\" reached, and the number of attempts needed. Where two climbers have the same score (i.e. \"tops\" plus \"zones\"), the number of \"tops\" takes precedence, and where they are still level, the fewest attempts takes precedence.\nCompetition speed climbing.\nIn International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC) speed climbing competitions, climbers must ascend a 15-meter wall, which is slightly overhanging by 5 degrees, as fast as possible. Unlike lead climbing or bouldering, speed climbing holds are always the exact same size and placed in the exact same location. \nIn the qualification round, competitors race in pairs in Lane A and Lane B, however, they are not racing against each other, but against the clock. Each competitor will race twice — once in each Lane — and the 16 fastest competitors, ranked by their best time, reach the finals. In the finals, competitors race against each other in single-elimination rounds, with the winner, regardless of time, advancing until the ultimate winner is decided.\nNotable competitions.\nIFSC.\nThe most important competition climbing events are administered by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC):\nOlympics.\nIn August 2016, it was announced that climbing would be included for the first time in the 2020 Olympics. At the 2020 Olympics, competition climbers competed in a unique once-off combined format, where their lead, bouldering, and speed climbing rankings were added to determine a single medal event. The 2020 winners of this single combined format were Alberto Ginés López for men, and Janja Garnbret for women.\nFor the 2024 Olympics, the format is changed to be closer to the IFSC format, with speed climbing separated into a standalone event, although lead climbing and bouldering are still a combined event (i.e. unlike the IFSC-format, there will not be standalone lead and bouldering medal events).\nNotable competition climbers.\nAs of 2023, the most successful overall male competition climber in history is Austrian climber Jakob Schubert, followed by Czech climber Adam Ondra, and French climber François Legrand. Legrand is the most successful lead competition climber, Austrian climber Kilian Fischhuber is the most successful bouldering competition climber, and Chinese climber Zhong Qixin is the most successful speed competition climber.\nAs of 2023, the most successful overall female competition climber in history is Slovenian climber Janja Garnbret, followed by French climber Sandrine Levet, and Austrian climber Angela Eiter. Garnbret is also the most successful lead competition climber, Levet also is the most successful bouldering competition climber, and Russian climber Tatiana Ruyga is the most successful speed competition climber.\nAs of 2023, Garnbret is the most dominant competition climber, male or female, of all time.\nNotable non-competition climbers.\nAs competition climbing developed in the 1980s, some of the leading sport climbers largely ignored it to focus on setting new grade milestones in sport climbing. German climber Wolfgang Güllich, the strongest sport climber of that era, avoided the climbing competition circuit throughout his career saying: \"competitions are good for earning money, I see it as nothing more\". In 1990, British leading climber Jerry Moffatt retired early from a promising competition climbing career saying: \"I no longer had energy the energy to keep it all up. I wanted to get myself back again. I wanted to see my friends. I wanted to climb for myself. I wanted to do first ascents. Most of all I wanted to have fun\". In 2001, American climber Chris Sharma, the strongest sport climber of his era, also retired early from competition climbing saying: \"Personally, that's not ever really been my deal. I mean, competitions are fun, but 15 minutes after the competition they take the holds off. It's way more important for me to put up new routes and develop my vision in rock climbing. Create a legacy, create something lasting. No one remembers who won the freakin' World Cup in 1997, but people know who put up \"Action Directe\".\nSince 2010, it has become increasingly rarer for leading male and female rock climbers, in both sport climbing and bouldering, not to begin their careers as successful competition climbers. Exceptions still exist, including leading French sport climber Seb Bouin, who wanted to instead focus on finding \"mega lines\" (a reference to Sharma's \"King Lines\") on outdoor crags, which he described as his sole motivation."

Rugby union was introduced by the British during colonial rule and Uganda played their first international game against Kenya in 1958. They have not yet qualified for the Rugby World Cup.\nUganda compete annually against Kenya in the Elgon Cup and the Africa Cup. The Rugby Cranes won the CAR in 2007.\nHistory.\nUganda has a long history of rugby participation dating back to even before the first official rugby match was ever played in 1958. The Uganda Rugby Football Union (URFU) as it was known then was formed in 1955. There were no clubs formed at the time and games were frequently played between representative sides from Kenya and Tanganyika (Tanzania at the time) but most notably against the Royal Navy and some British and South African Universities.\nIn the early 1930s there was only one rugby club in Uganda called the \"Uganda Rugby Football Club\", which later became \"Uganda Kobs Rugby Football Club\" and then its name was changed to \"Kampala Kobs Rugby Football Club\". Most rugby games were played in Entebbe.\nThe East Africa team played some of the best sides in the world, including the British Lions in 1955, South Africa in 1961, and Wales in 1964. The three African Great Lakes countries of Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda have a long shared history of rugby. For much of their history, they have relied on each other for club, inter-district, inter-territorial and international matches, as well as combining their resources to create a regional squad called \"the Tuskers\".\nThe three East African countries, at the time, each had membership in the Rugby Football Union of East Africa (RFUEA), an umbrella union for the three nations both before and after they each achieved independence in the early 1960s. Until independence, each was regarded as a colonial possession of the British Empire rather than an independent nation.\nThe first official match between Uganda and Kenya took place in 1958 played in Kampala a game Uganda lost; Uganda scoring 11 points to 21 for Kenya. Uganda Rugby Union formally Uganda Rugby Football Union, become a World Rugby formally International Rugby Board affiliate in 1997 and now has a total rugby playing population of approximately 22,000.\nWith the formation of the Confederation of African Rugby (now known as Rugby Africa) in 2000, the Ugandan Rugby Union also became automatic full members. Uganda's biggest winning margin was to come in 2003 when Uganda beat Burundi 100-0. Uganda would later post its worst defeat in 2005 against South Africa; Uganda scored 10 points to 98 for South Africa XV.\nCurrent squad.\nUganda 2022 Africa Cup squad\nAkera Komaketch, Joseph Aredo, Arthur Mpande, Asuman Mugerwa, Aziku Robert, Tawfik Bagalana, Chissano Joachim, Emmanuel Ecodu, Emong Eliphaz, Paul Epilo, Thomas Gwokto, Juuko Jude, Kanyanya Ronald, Kato Reynolds, Khani Aziziz, Colin Kimbowa, Ivan Kirabo, Saul Kivumbi , Ivan Magomu (Captain), Manano Alhaji, James Mugisha, Jacob Ochen, Uhuru Charles, Timothy Oodongo, Faragi Odugo, Pius Ogena, Okia Solomon, George Scott Olwuoch, Michael Otto, Joseph Oyet, Alema Ruhweza, Lawrence Ssebuliba, Santos Ssenteza, Wanyama Conrad, Philip Wokorach\nRecent results.\nFor the 2017 series, the Africa Cup fixture between Kenya and Uganda will double up as the second leg of the Elgon Cup."

Brophy continues to travel with his troupe across Queensland each year. For his years of touring with his tent boxing show, Brophy was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2011 for his role in raising money for charity and for services to the entertainment industry.\nA dangerous sport.\nLargely unreported on, little is known about early tent boxers and events due to participants and spectators being largely illiterate. In more modern times, very few photographs exist of the movement as organisers disapprove of media involvement.\nFred Brophy insists he will continue travelling with his tent boxing troupe, until he dies, even though the sport was banned in New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia in 1971 by the government, due to health concerns."

        "text": "The 2003 UEFA Champions League final was a football match that took place at Old Trafford in Manchester, England on 28 May 2003 to decide the winner of the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League. The match was contested by two Italian teams: Juventus and Milan. The match made history as it was the first time two clubs from Italy had faced each other in the final. It was also the second intra-national final of the competition, following the all-Spanish 2000 UEFA Champions League final between Real Madrid and Valencia three years earlier. Milan won the match via a penalty shoot-out after the game had finished 0–0 after extra time. It gave Milan their sixth success in the European Cup.\nBackground.\nJuventus entered the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League as 2001–02 Serie A champions and so qualified for the group phase, Milan finished fourth so started off in the third qualifying round.\nJuventus went into the Champions League final as champions of Italy for the 27th time. Milan came third in the league, finishing with eleven fewer points than Juventus, but would win the 2002–03 Coppa Italia. The league games between the two teams in 2002–03 had each side winning their home fixture 2–1.\nRoute to the final.\nMilan.\nMilan won Group G of the first group round, a group that also included Bayern Munich, Lens and Deportivo La Coruña, advancing to the second group round where they won Group C. They defeated Real Madrid, Borussia Dortmund and Lokomotiv Moscow. They lost only two matches (Dortmund 1–0, and Real Madrid 3–1), and advanced to the quarter-finals where they met Ajax. The first leg was a draw (0–0) so the decisive match was the one at the San Siro which Milan won (3–2). In the semi-finals, they met local rivals Inter Milan. Both matches finished equal (0–0; 1–1), but Milan advanced on the away goals rule, despite both teams technically playing at home.\nJuventus.\nJuventus won Group E of the first group round, in which the other teams were Newcastle United, Dynamo Kyiv and Feyenoord. They finished second in Group D of the second group round, after Manchester United, due to their losses against the English side (2–1; 3–0) and against Basel (2–1), but they qualified to the quarter-finals where they eliminated Barcelona in extra-time (1–1; 2–1). In the semi-final, Juventus met Real Madrid; they lost the first match (2–1), but they won the second (3–1), key midfielder Pavel Nedved picked up a second yellow card which meant he was suspended for the final.\nPre-match.\nVenue.\nOld Trafford, the home of Manchester United, was selected to host the match in December 2001, following a meeting of the UEFA Executive Committee in Nyon, Switzerland, at the same time as Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville was selected to host the 2003 UEFA Cup Final. It was selected ahead of the likes of the Santiago Bernabeu Stadium in Madrid, the Stade de France in Saint-Denis near Paris, and the Amsterdam Arena.\nIt would be the first time the stadium had hosted a major European final, although it had been the venue for both the two-legged 1968 Intercontinental Cup between Manchester United and Argentine club Estudiantes de La Plata, and the 1991 European Super Cup between Manchester United and Yugoslavian club Red Star Belgrade, which had been scheduled to be played over two legs, only for the Yugoslavian leg to be cancelled due to the wars in the country at the time.\nThe stadium had recently undergone a major expansion; following the mandatory conversion to an all-seater venue as a result of the Taylor Report and ahead of England hosting UEFA Euro 1996, the stadium's North Stand was expanded to three tiers, with a capacity of 25,500 spectators. This was followed by the addition of second tiers to the East and West Stands, which brought the overall capacity of the stadium to 68,217.\nAs has taken place for every Champions League final since 1997, a ceremonial handover of the European Champion Clubs' Cup from the holders to the host city took place on 3 April 2003. After receiving the trophy from a representative of holders Real Madrid in the ceremony at the Manchester Town Hall, UEFA Chief Executive Gerhard Aigner presented it to the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Roy Walters. Former Real Madrid players Alfredo Di Stéfano, Francisco Gento, Amancio and Emilio Butragueño, as were Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, members of the club's 1968 European Cup final team, and members of Liverpool and Manchester City's past European trophy-winning teams.\nAlso in April 2003, a 24-hour football match – named the \"Starball Match\" in reference to the logo of the UEFA Champions League – was played in Manchester's Albert Square. It was the second Starball Match, after the inaugural match was held in Glasgow ahead of the 2002 UEFA Champions League final at Hampden Park. Over 1,000 players participated in the match, playing for sides named \"Internazionale Manchester\" and \"Real Mancunian\", in reference to Italian club Inter Milan and Spanish club Real Madrid. Internazionale Manchester won the match 252–162.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nAfter a brisk start, Milan had an Andriy Shevchenko goal ruled out after Rui Costa was deemed to have blocked Gianluigi Buffon's line of view from an offside position, although television replays showed that the Portuguese had moved out of Buffon's line of sight before the shot. Antonio Conte nearly scored for Juventus after coming on as a substitute in the second half, his header clattering against the post with Dida beaten. Andrea Pirlo also hit the bar for Milan. In the second half, both teams began to sit back and created few chances.\nBoth Juventus and Milan had injuries to defenders during the course of the game; Igor Tudor had to be substituted for Alessandro Birindelli towards the end of the first half of regular time after pulling a muscle in his right thigh. Five minutes into the first half of extra time, Roque Júnior sustained an injury to his left thigh in a challenge against Paolo Montero and had to play the rest of the game through the pain as Milan had run out of substitutions.\nThe penalty shoot-out has caused controversy among some fans as replays showed that Dida was in front of the goal line when saving penalties from David Trezeguet, Marcelo Zalayeta and Paolo Montero. Buffon was also off his line when saving penalties from Clarence Seedorf and Kakha Kaladze. Shevchenko put away the final penalty to win the European Cup for Milan for the sixth time.\nPost-match and legacy.\nThe teams would again meet in a feature final several months later in the 2003 Supercoppa Italiana in the United States. The game again required penalties to determine the winners, this time, however, Juventus came out on top.\nOn 28 May 2023, the twentieth anniversary of the UEFA Champions League final in Manchester, both teams coincidentally met on the penultimate matchday of their Serie A domestic league, with Milan once again prevailing over Juventus in a 1–0 away victory in Turin. Out of all players and technical staff from both teams present in Manchester twenty years ago, only Paolo Maldini was still involved with his club as a technical director at the time, shortly before his resignation in early June. Ironically, Pavel Nedvěd, suspended for the 2003 final through accumulation of yellow cards, had also been suspended from his executive duties at Juventus for 8 months in January 2023 due to his club's involvement in violations of financial fair play, and therefore could not attend the game."

Since it became a member of the Pac-12, it had the highest winning percentage, at .681, of all schools that participate in Division I baseball within the conference. ASU's NCAA leading 54 consecutive 30 win seasons was the longest streak in the nation. The Sun Devils have had just four losing seasons in program history (1963, 2017, 2018, and 2022). The Sun Devils had been nationally ranked during at least a part of every season of their 58-year history until 2017. The Sun Devils have finished 27 times in the Top 10, 22 times in the Top 5, and 5 times as the No. 1 team in the nation.\nASU is one of the most successful college baseball programs in the country. The Sun Devils have won five national championships, the fourth-most by any school, and are 1st in total number of alumni to ever play in Major League Baseball. Notable Sun Devil baseball alumni include Barry Bonds, Jim Palmer Reggie Jackson, Sal Bando, Dustin Pedroia, Andre Ethier, Bob Horner, Paul Lo Duca, and Rick Monday. \nHistory.\nThe Bobby Winkles years (1959–1971).\nArizona State University adopted baseball as a varsity sport in 1959. Under the guidance of coach Bobby Winkles, the Sun Devils finished their first season with a 28–18–1 record. In 1964, Coach Winkles led the team to a 44–7 record, winning the Western Athletic Conference title. They beat Utah twice in the WAC playoffs and then beat Air Force 6–1 and 7–6 to win District 7 and advanced to the 1964 College World Series. In their first game the Sun Devils were shut out 7–0 by the Missouri Tigers. The next day they beat Mississippi 5–0 before losing their next game two days later 4–2 to Maine. The following year the Sun Devils went 9–3 in the WAC to win back-to-back conference championships. In 1965, Rick Monday was taken first overall in the inaugural Major League First-Year Player Draft.\nTheir first game in the 1965 College World Series was a blowout win against Lafayette. The offense again exploded against St. Louis 13–3. They beat Ohio State 9–4, then beat St. Louis again 6–2 where they faced Ohio State. Arizona State lost the first game 7–3 but won the next game 2–1 to win their first national championship. The following season the defending national champions were unable to defend their title as they finished the season 41–11, finishing second in the conference, and failed to make the postseason.\nIn 1967 the Sun Devils were able to get back to the College World Series as they went 53–12 and made an appearance in the WAC championship losing the first game to BYU 3–0, before coming back to win the next two 6–3 and 4–3 to win the WAC championship. In the District 7 playoff series, they split the first two games of the series, winning 11–0 then losing 5–2. They were able to win the final game of the series 6–0 advancing to the 1967 College World Series. They opened winning two blowout games 7–2 and 8–1 against Oklahoma State and Boston College before winning a close one against Stanford 5–3. They were shut out in the next game against the Houston Cougars 3–0 before coming back to beat Stanford 4–3 and avenging the loss against Houston to win a blowout 11–2 to win their second national championship.\nOnce again, the Sun Devils followed up their national championship season with a second place conference finish and failed to receive a postseason berth. In 1969 the Devils were able to return to the World Series winning the WAC championship against BYU, then swept Idaho 7–1 and 3–2 in the District 7 playoff. They dropped their first game of the 1969 College World Series 4–0 to Texas, however they would win their next five games to win their third national championship in five years, winning the championship game 10–1 against Tulsa. This was the program's third national championship in the last five years.\nAfter the 1971 season, Coach Winkles was hired by the California Angels. Bobby Winkles was ASU's first varsity baseball coach and maintained an impressive 524–173 record during his 13 years of coaching for the Sun Devils. A three-time NCAA Coach of the Year, Winkles took the ASU program from scratch and built it into one of the premier powerhouses in all of college baseball.\nThe Packard Stadium years.\nWinkles Field-Packard Stadium at Brock Ballpark, located in Tempe, was the home of Arizona State baseball from 1974 to 2014. Dimensions of Packard are down the lines, in the power alleys and 395 to straightaway center. The fence is high. Located five feet beyond the center-field wall is the \"Green Monster,\" a 30-foot-high batting eye. The outfield wall is lined with orange trees and just beyond the left field fence lies the Salt River which winds its way through the Valley of the Sun.\nThe facility is the home of two national championship teams and 17 NCAA regional tournaments.

        "title": "Black Mist Scandal (Japanese baseball)",
        "text": "The refers to a series of game fixing scandals in Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) league and flat track motorcycle racing between 1969 and 1971. The fallout from these scandals resulted in several star players receiving long suspensions, salary cuts, or being banned from professional play entirely. The scandals led many fans in Japan to abandon the sport, and also to the sale of such illustrious teams as the Nishitetsu Lions and Toei Flyers (now the Seibu Lions and Hokkaidō Nippon Ham Fighters).\nThe term \"black mist\" was a reference to a political scandal that had enveloped the administration of Prime Minister Eisaku Satō just a few years earlier; \"bribery was said to envelop politics like a black mist.\"\nHistory.\nThe Black Mist Scandal had multiple components, involving the \"yakuza\" and members of both Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and professional flat track motorcycle racing (one of the four public sports where parimutuel betting is permitted) teams. Baseball players and executives were implicated in fixing competitions in both sports. The bulk of the revelations around the scandal came out between the fall of 1969 and the spring of 1970. Eventually, more than fifteen NPB players and coaches were implicated in game-fixing and sports betting, while five flat track racers were found to be involved in a race-fixing scheme. Members of nine NPB teams were implicated, with seven players coming from the Nishitetsu Lions alone. Ten NPB current and former players — including star pitchers Masaaki Ikenaga, Kentarō Ogawa, and Tsutomu Tanaka — were banned from the game for life.\nGame-fixing.\nDuring the 1969 season, Lions foreign player Carl Boles reported to Japanese news media that players were playing suspiciously, leading to a front office investigation where on October 7, 1969, pitcher Masayuki Nagayasu was found to have taken bribes from a \"yakuza\" clan to throw games. The team announced that Nagayasu would be released after the end of the season, and the story was reported in Japanese newspapers the next day. Late in November, the executive committee presiding over the NPB at the time voted to ban Nagayasu from the league for life, the first time any player had been banned from Japanese baseball.\nOn April 1, 1970, in an exclusive tape-recorded interview with the \"Shūkan Post\" newspaper, also broadcast on Fuji Television, Nagayasu revealed that other players on his former team were also involved in game-fixing. The NPB summoned seven players to testify about their involvement: Nagayasu, team ace Masaaki Ikenaga, pitchers Yoshinobu Yoda and Akio Masuda, catcher Kimiyasu Murakami, and infielders Kazuhide Funada and Mitsuo Motoi. Yoda and Masuda admitted their involvement. Ikenaga claimed to be uninvolved, but had not returned the ¥1 million he had received from Chunichi Dragons pitcher and former teammate Tsutomu Tanaka as an invitation to cheat.\nOne month later, Toei Flyers pitchers Toshiaki Moriyasu and Mitsugu Tanaka were revealed to be under suspicion of throwing baseball games. A subsequent report revealed that Kintetsu Buffaloes front-office official Akira Yano had been coerced into throwing games as a player during the 1967 season.\nOn May 25, 1970, the executive committee issued the following punishments to the accused Nishitetsu players:\nIn June the committee banned the Buffaloes' Akira Yano from baseball for life. In July, Buffaloes outfielder Masahiro Doi was prosecuted for illegal gambling. He was later suspended by the NPB for a month.\nOn July 30, 1970, the committee issued the following punishments for the Toei players:\nOn November 30, Hanshin Tigers pitcher Yutaka Enatsu received a stern warning from the Central League president due to \"involvement with persons in baseball gambling.\"\nOn January 11, 1971, Nankai Hawks pitcher Kiyohiro Miura received a stern warning for receiving an invitation to throw games from teammate Kimihiro Satō and not reporting it. On January 29 of that year, Taiyō coach Takashi Suzuki and pitcher Shōji Sakai were barred from playing in the NPB for their involvement with the \"yakuza\". Finally, on February 15, 1971, Lotte Orions pitcher Fumio Narita was suspended for a month for his involvement with bookmakers.\nRace-fixing.\nOn April 22, 1970, a flat track motorcycle racer under investigation for rule violations in a race revealed that baseball players were involved in a scheme to fix the results of races. (In Japan, four sports -- flat track motorcycle racing, track cycling, powerboat racing, and horse racing are designated as the \"kōei kyōgi,\" or public sports for parimutuel gambling.) Three men were arrested under suspicion of participating in the scheme: Chunichi Dragons pitcher Tsutomu Tanaka, Taiyō Whales pitcher Isao Takayama, and \"yakuza\" member Hirotaka Fujinawa. A few weeks later, Kentarō Ogawa, star pitcher for the Dragons, was arrested for taking part in the flat track fixing. Later on in May, Hanshin Tigers infielder Takao Katsuragi was arrested in the flat track scandal. In June, the NPB committee banned Ogawa from baseball for life; they suspended Katsuragi for three months.\nOn September 8, 1970, Yakult Swallows infielder Takeshi Kuwata (who had been the 1959 rookie of the year) was arrested for his role in the flat track scandal. He would later receive a three-month suspension from the NPB, but his involvement effectively barred him from signing with another team, and he retired at the end of the year.\nIkenaga's reinstatement.\nIkenaga's banning was fiercely contested by both Nishitetsu's front office and Ikenaga's family. His case was not taken up by the NPB until March 2005, when commissioner Yasuchika Negoro and team owners agreed on a bylaw that allowed banned players who have reformed themselves to petition for a removal of the ban. Ikenaga requested a removal soon afterwards, and on April 25, 2005, he was allowed to return to baseball."

        "title": "Kevin Porter (basketball)",
        "text": "Kevin Porter (born April 17, 1950) is an American former professional basketball player. He played eleven seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and led the league in assists four times in his pro career.\nAmateur career.\nBorn and raised in Chicago, Porter graduated from DuSable High School, earning a starting point guard spot as a sophomore, averaging 15 ppg and 7 apg. Steady improvement in his junior (to 20.7 ppg, 9 apg) and senior seasons (22.9 ppg, 13 apg), earned him All-City and All-Area honors in 1968. Porter led DuSable to the last Chicago Daily News Christmas Holiday Tournament Championship.\nPorter then played collegiately at Saint Francis University in Loretto, Pennsylvania. Porter thrived at Saint Francis, scoring 1,766 points in his career, averaging 22.9 over four years, including 24.7 ppg as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nOver an 11-year NBA career, Porter averaged 11.6 ppg, 8.1 apg, while winning four assist titles. Basketball historian Bijan Bayne said, “What always stood out about Kevin Porter is that he was pass-first, in an era of Pistol, Clyde, Pearl, Tiny, Westphal and Jo Jo. That watered down his star quality. But he had this signature high yo-yo dribble that was under supreme control, as he surveyed with his head up—unusual before Magic. He should be remembered as someone with quickness and vision who orchestrated NBA games against history’s premier guards.” Porter himself added, \"That's what I did. I got the ball to scorers. That's what kept me in the league that long.\"\nBaltimore / Capital / Washington Bullets (1972–1975).\nIn the 1972 NBA draft, Porter was the 39th overall pick, selected by the Baltimore Bullets in the third round. In his second year, he led the league in personal fouls with 319. While he received 320 the next year, he won a starting role and won the first of four NBA assist titles (8.0 per game) in 1975. The Bullets reached the NBA Finals, but were swept by the underdog Golden State Warriors.\nDetroit Pistons (1975–1977).\nIn late August 1975, Porter was traded to the Detroit Pistons for Dave Bing and a first round draft pick used to select Tree Rollins. Porter suffered a knee injury in the first season with Detroit and appeared in only nineteen games. Returning to the court for the 1976-77 Detroit Pistons season, Porter clashed with coach Herb Brown, telling a Detroit Free Press reporter, \"Write this - I want out. He is not man enough to say that the problem is him and me — well, I am. Nothing is going to get solved here.\" Sports Illustrated covered the tension but the Pistons made the post-season (44-38, .537) despite challenges between Brown and Porter, as well as those with Marvin \"Bad News\" Barnes in a season PistonsPowered would describe as \"absolutely insane, probably the craziest in Pistons history. They won a lot of games, but were completely dysfunctional.\" John Papanek of Sports Illustrated (SI) would state, \"if the Pistons were a TV mini-series, they would make Roots seem like Ding Dong School.\"\nNew Jersey Nets (1977–1978).\nIn the early start of his third season with the Pistons, the tensions with Brown came to a head as Porter was traded with Howard Porter and cash to the New Jersey Nets for Al Skinner, a 1978 2nd round draft pick (used to select Terry Tyler) and a 1979 2nd round draft pick (used to select Tony Price). Herb Brown was fired as well.\nWith New Jersey, on February 24, 1978, Porter had 29 assists in a game against the Rockets while with the Nets. He also had 14 points and 5 rebounds in a season that led to his 2nd assist title (10.2 apg). The per-game assist record would stand until Scott Skiles tallied 30 assists on December 30, 1990. Porter also averaged a career high 16.2 ppg for the Nets in 1977-78.\nReturn to Detroit (1978–1979).\nAfter the season, Porter was traded back to the Pistons, now led by coach Dick Vitale, in exchange for Eric Money. In that season, he won his third assist title - 13.4 apg, including a remarkable 30 point-25 assist game, on March 9, 1979. Additionally he was the first player to record over 1,000 assists in a single season. It would be five years before another player would record over 1,000 assists. Porter appeared as a member of the Detroit team in the cult classic basketball film The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh in 1979 alongside Pistons teammates Bob Lanier, Eric Money, John Shumate, Chris Ford, and Leon Douglas.\nReturn to the Bullets (1979–1983).\nAfter that season, Porter signed as a veteran free agent with the Washington Bullets for 1979-80. The Detroit Pistons received a first round draft pick in 1980 (which ended up with Golden State, who selected Rickey Brown with that pick) and a 1982 first round pick (Used to select John Bagley) as compensation for his departure. Porter appeared in two playoff games that year and garnered nine assists as the Bullets fell in the first round. The following year, he had 9.1 assists per game, which was enough to win his final assist title. However, during training camp before the 1981 season, he snapped his Achilles tendon, missing all of that season.\nHe only played 11 games of the next season, having only 4.2 assists per game. On January 18, 1983, he was waived by the Bullets. When he retired in 1983, he had accumulated 5,314 career assists (good for 49th all time) and 7,645 career points, while also being 14th all time in career assists per game and 13th in assist percentage at 37.5. Notably, of the top 50 in career assist leaders, he played the fewest games (659). Despite leading the league in assists per game four times, he was never selected to an All Star Game. Only five players have won more assists titles than Porter, and all five of them are in the Hall of Fame (Stockton, Cousy, Robertson, Nash and Kidd).\nToyota Super Corollas (1983).\nIn 1983, Porter played in the Philippines for the fabled Toyota Super Corollas team in the Philippine Basketball Association as an import during the 1983 PBA Reinforced Filipino Conference tournament. He scored 50 points in his debut on May 17, 1983 in a 135-141 loss to Tanduay Rhum, but was let go after eight games.\nPost playing career.\nWhile Porter was playing in the Philippines, the head coaching job at Saint Francis University became available and Georgetown University coach John Thompson recommended Porter for the job. Porter took over as the St. Francis head coach on July 11, 1983. During his four seasons as the St. Franics coach, Porter's record was 42-68 (.382).\nPorter then coached at Central State University, a historically black college in Ohio, and then returned to his hometown Chicago, fulfilling a dream to become an elementary physical education teacher, helping at-risk children with after school programs. \"I've been blessed. All I wanted was to be a fifth-grade teacher. That was my life. I wanted to be a teacher.\"\nPorter was inducted into the Illinois Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame in 1976, the Cambria County Sports Hall of Fame in 1984 and the Saint Francis Athletics Hall of Fame in 2003. Porter is retired and lives in Chicago.\nIn January 2022, Washington Wizards announcer Glenn Consor apologized to former Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. when he commented that Porter \"like his dad, pulled the trigger right at the right time\", after Porter made a key shot, under the mistaken belief that Porter Jr. was the son of Kevin Porter, the former Washington point guard. The father of Kevin Porter Jr., Bryan Kevin Porter Sr., pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in a shooting death of a 14-year-old girl in 1993 and was sentenced to 4 1/2 years in prison. Porter Sr. died in 2004 after being shot in a South Seattle bar. Porter Jr. was 4 years old when his father was killed."

        "text": "The Cold War was a college ice hockey game played between U.S. college rivals Michigan State University and the University of Michigan on Saturday, October 6, 2001. It set a then-world record for the largest crowd at an ice hockey game with 74,544.\nLongtime rivals with the University of Michigan in hockey (and other sports), MSU decided not to play this contest at East Lansing's Munn Ice Arena, but instead set up the ice rink in the middle of the much larger Spartan Stadium, which they filled to 103.4% capacity. This meant that 74,544 packed the Big Ten football stadium (the home of the MSU football team) to watch the MSU Spartans and the U-M Wolverines skate to a 3–3 tie. Two 300-piece marching bands were present on field and the game was internationally televised. Country artist Shannon Brown sang during the second intermission.\nRecord surpassed.\nThe opening game of the 2010 IIHF World Championship took place on May 7 at the retractable-roof Veltins-Arena, normally used by the soccer club Schalke 04. On this occasion, the stadium's configuration allowed for a capacity of 75,976, which would ultimately be exceeded by almost 2,000, breaking the all-time attendance record.\nOn December 11, 2010, the two teams involved in the Cold War met again, this time with Michigan hosting the game at its football venue, Michigan Stadium. UM billed the game as \"The Big Chill at the Big House Presented by Arby's\". When UM halted ticket sales to the general public on May 6, 2010, over 100,000 tickets had been sold. As of the 2010 football season, Michigan Stadium had an official capacity of 109,901. The game ended with a 5–0 victory for the University of Michigan. The record was officially set at 104,173 people.\nTelevision.\nThe game was broadcast by FSN Detroit, which made it available nationally. The announcers were Matt Shepard, Billy Jaffe and Shireen Saski. John Keating hosted a pregame show."

        "text": "Michael Thomas Heath (born February 5, 1955) is an American former professional baseball catcher. He played 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the New York Yankees (1978), Oakland Athletics (1979–1985), St. Louis Cardinals (1986), Detroit Tigers (1986–1990), and Atlanta Braves (1991).\nWhile Heath played most of his games as a catcher, he started his professional baseball career as a shortstop and played every position except pitcher during his major league career. He played 1,083 games at catcher, 142 games in right field, 79 games in left field, 39 games as a DH, 38 games at third base, four games each at first base and shortstop, and one game each at second base and center field.\nCareer.\nDrafted by the New York Yankees in the second round of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft, Heath made his major league debut with the team on June 3, 1978, at the age of 23. He hit .228 in 33 games with the 1978 Yankees and appeared in one game of the 1978 World Series.\nOn November 10, 1978, the Yankees traded Heath, Sparky Lyle, Larry McCall, Dave Rajsich, Domingo Ramos, and cash to the Texas Rangers for Dave Righetti, Juan Beníquez, Mike Griffin, Paul Mirabella, and Greg Jemison. The following June, after never playing at the major league level for Texas, Heath was traded to the Oakland Athletics where he got substantial playing time in seven seasons with the Athletics. Heath hit .333 for the A's in the 1981 American League Championship Series.\nWhile with the A's, Heath caught Mike Warren's no-hitter on September 29, 1983.\nAfter a season in which he batted .250 with 13 home runs, Heath was traded along with Tim Conroy from the Athletics to the Cardinals for Joaquín Andújar during the Winter Meetings on December 10, 1985. The Cardinals were in need of a catcher after releasing Darrell Porter and having only a barely tested Tom Nieto on its depth chart.\nHeath was known for his strong throwing arm. In 1989, playing with the Detroit Tigers, Heath led the AL's catchers with 66 assists and 10 double plays.\nHeath singled in his last plate appearance vs. the Cincinnati Reds on July 2, 1991.\nIn 1325 games over 14 seasons, Heath posted a .252 batting average (1061-for-4212) with 462 runs, 173 doubles, 27 triples, 86 home runs, 469 RBI, 54 stolen bases and 278 bases on balls. He finished his career with an overall .981 fielding percentage. In nine postseason games, he batted .190 (4-for-21) with 2 runs, 1 home run and 2 RBI."
