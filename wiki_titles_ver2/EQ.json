        "title": "2006 NCAA Division I baseball season",
        "text": "The 2006 NCAA Division I baseball season play of college baseball in the United States, organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) at the Division I level, began on January 26, 2006. The season progressed through the regular season, many conference tournaments and championship series, and concluded with the 2006 NCAA Division I baseball tournament and 2006 College World Series. The College World Series, which consisted of the eight remaining teams in the NCAA tournament, was held in its annual location of Omaha, Nebraska, at Rosenblatt Stadium. It concluded on June 26, 2006, with the final game of the best of three championship series. Oregon State defeated North Carolina two games to one to claim their first championship.\nRealignment.\nNew programs.\nStephen F. Austin brought back its varsity intercollegiate baseball program for the 2006 season, after having dropped the program following the 1995 season.\nBoth Kennesaw State and North Florida transitioned from Division II to Division I for the 2006 season.\nConference changes.\nEntering the 2006 baseball season, many baseball-sponsoring schools changed conferences. Several schools left Conference USA, as Charlotte and St. Louis left for the Atlantic 10 Conference, Cincinnati, Louisville, and South Florida left for the Big East Conference, and Texas Christian left for the Mountain West Conference. In order to replace these schools, Conference USA added Rice from the Western Athletic Conference, Marshall from the Mid-American Conference, and Central Florida from the Atlantic Sun Conference.\nIn order to compensate for the schools lost to Conference USA, the Western Athletic Conference also made several changes. New Mexico State joined from the Sun Belt Conference, along with Sacramento State, previously a Division I Independent. The Sun Belt, in turn, added Florida Atlantic and Troy from the Atlantic Sun. The Colonial Athletic Association added Northeastern from the America East Conference and Georgia State from the Atlantic Sun Conference.\nThe Atlantic Sun added three schools, East Tennessee State from the Southern Conference and Kennesaw State and North Florida from the Division II Peach Belt Conference.\nThe Atlantic Coast Conference added Boston College from the Big East.\nThe Southland Conference added one program, as conference member Stephen F. Austin revived its baseball program.\nConference formats.\nAs a result of the addition of Boston College as a 12th member, the Atlantic Coast Conference split into two six-team divisions. The Atlantic 10 Conference, which had added both Charlotte and St. Louis, eliminated its previous format of two six-team divisions. The West Coast Conference, which had previously competed in two four-team divisions, also eliminated its divisional format.\nCollege World Series.\nThe 2006 season marked the sixtieth NCAA baseball tournament, which culminated with the eight team College World Series. The College World Series was held in Omaha, Nebraska. The eight teams played a double-elimination format, with Oregon State claiming their first championship with a two games to one series win over North Carolina in the final."

        "text": "Sarajevo Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track is a bobsleigh and luge track situated on Trebević mountain overlooking the City of Sarajevo, built for the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nHistory.\nWhen Sarajevo was awarded the 1984 Winter Olympics in 1977, a bobsleigh and luge track was proposed. The track design was approved in 1981, with construction starting on 1 June of that year. Assembly of the track was completed on 30 September 1982 at a cost of YUD 563,209,000. The first international competition of merit held at the track was the 1983 European Bobsleigh Championships in January of that year. At the 1984 Games, there were 20,000 luge spectators and 30,000 bobsleigh spectators. After the Winter Olympics, the track was used for World Cup competitions until the Yugoslav wars started in 1991, which included the Bosnian War the following year. The track was damaged as a result of the Siege of Sarajevo; during the siege, the track was used as an artillery position by Bosnian Serb forces. The track still remains mostly intact (), with the war wounds of defensive fighting holes drilled into one of the last turns of the course. The track has been used for graffiti and bicycling in the period between the end of the war and the commencement of renovations in 2014. In June 2014, restoration began on the track, including the removal of overgrowth and graffiti, and the application of a protective coating from Start 1 down to the bottom of the course.\nDesign.\nIn preparation for the 1984 Winter Olympic Games, Mt. Trebević was selected as the site for a new sliding complex. The track complex was designed by architect Gorazd Bučar, with a vision for both reduced footprint of the facility, and flexible and adaptable use as a piece of Olympic Legacy Infrastructure. The track can be split into three segments for recreational and training purposes.\nWhen the track saw its first real competition (and a test competition ahead of the 1984 Olympic Winter Games), 1,246 heats of two- and four-man bobs were completed with just four overturns and only one serious injury reported. FIL (International Luge Federation) and FIBT (International Federation of Bobsleigh and Tobogganing) experts heralded the track as \"Safe, Quick, and technically interesting and requires extreme concentration and technical knowledge.\"\nThe top section, known as 'Course 1', begins at the upper start house and runs , splitting from the main track at turn 3. With the slightest grade, it is suitable for all riders.\nThe center section, known as 'Course 2', begins at the second start house and runs splitting from the main track at turn 7, after the complex and high-G 'Double S' turns (5, 6, and 7). It is more intense and complex, and provides a good training and recreational experience of complex turning.\nThe bottom section, known as 'Course 3', begins below turn 7, and at is the longest and fastest segment of the track containing some of the most complex turns in sliding: Omega, the Hairpin and the Labyrinth. Course 3 ends at the bottom of the track.\nRenovation.\nBeginning in 2014, following an extensive demining operation, limited renovations began-preparing the site for summer training with a grant from the International Luge Federation. As of January 2018 that operation continues. It is unclear when winter events will begin again due to the complete loss of both start houses and the refrigeration plant along with the extensive damage to every refrigerant and track-switching system on the track. The only remaining piece of the venue is the track itself, and is structurally in serviceable condition. However, the ultimate goal is to return the track to fully serviceable condition for hosting future sliding competitions and training teams from around the world.\nAfter the track's initial repairs, sliding sport competitors from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovakia, Poland, Turkey, Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia began regularly using the track for summer training. The damaged facility quickly became a regional training center and began receiving praise from its new users as one of the best of the nine such facilities available for training worldwide, and for bringing sliding sports back to the Balkans.\nIn the initial bid for the 2019 European Youth Olympic Winter Festival the track was considered for reconstruction to allow competition at the venue, however, due to the massive cost of rebuilding much of the track's critical infrastructure, sliding events were not run.\nIn April 2022, the Government of the Sarajevo Canton appointed a team to develop a plan for the revitalization and reconstruction of the entire facility as part of Barcelona's potential bid for the 2030 Winter Olympic Games.\nMajor events hosted.\nDuring its short ten-year operational history, the track hosted a number of high-profile sliding events.

        "title": "Billy Wilson (New Zealand rugby league)",
        "text": "William Wilson was a New Zealand professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s. He played at representative level for New Zealand (Heritage № 103), and Wellington, as a , or , i.e. number 2 or 5, or, 13, during the era of contested scrums.\nFamily and personal life.\nBilly Wilson was born on 17 May 1889 in Timaru to Tabitha Ann Wilson and Joseph William Wilson. His mother Tabitha was born in Batley, Yorkshire, England while his father Joseph was from the West Indies. Billy had three brothers, Joseph Simman, Nathaniel Arthur, and Charles Leslie, and two sisters, Elizabeth Maria May (Betty), and Ada. He also had a half sister, May Ineson after his mother remarried later in life to Johnathon (Johny) Cooper. His brother Nathaniel Arthur Wilson was better known as Ranji Wilson. He played 21 times for the All Blacks from 1908 to 1914. Billy Wilson was a carpenter by trade. At the time of his enlistment he stated that he was working for Campbell and Burke who ran a construction business in Wellington at the time.\nPlaying career.\nRugby union beginnings, Athletic RFC, and Wellington B.\nBilly Wilson began his senior oval ball career playing for the Athletic rugby club in Wellington. He had been a junior there and made his senior debut in a match on 7 May 1910 against Victoria College. He was only to play 4 games for them in total because of an extremely controversial and well publicised incident in 6 August match between Athletic and Poneke. It was alleged that his brother Ranji Wilson had struck Petone player Duilio Calcinai and broken his jaw. The case went to court 3 months later in November and received extensive front page newspaper coverage. Numerous witnesses were called to Ranji Wilson's trial with conflicting descriptions of what had happened and who had struck the blow. The match featured Ranji, Billy, and a third brother Joseph. They were similar looking enough that many witnesses said they couldn't be sure who struck the blow or each named a different brother. Billy said that he knew who struck the blow and when the Wellington Rugby Football Union asked him who it was he refused to answer. The Union then disqualified him from playing permanently at the start of the 1911 season for his failure to cooperate. Prior to the court case Wilson was selected to play for Wellington B in their match with Marlborough. He was considered a surprise selection because he had only played a handful of senior club matches. Wellington B lost the match 6-8.\nSwitch to rugby league, Athletic RL club, and Wellington.\nIn 1912, after being banned from playing rugby union Billy Wilson made the switch to rugby league where he joined the Athletic club. He had not played any football in the 1911 season. In 1922 when he applied for reinstatement at the end of his career he said to the Wellington Rugby Union that he had just wanted to play football. The Wellington rugby league competition was newly formed in 1912 with the Athletic club's birth in May that year. He played 9 matches for Athletic in their first season, mostly in the forwards but also some in the five eighth position.\nAt the beginning of the season prior to the club matches starting he played for a Wellington team against a combined Petone and Hutt side, then against Hawke's Bay, which they won 37-24, before a more official Wellington debut match against Nelson on the ground at Duppa Street in Wellington. In August he played against Auckland at Victoria Park in a 16-0 loss. At the end of the season on 7 September he played against Canterbury with Wellington winning 5 to 4.\n1913 was a busy season for Wilson as he played 13 matches for Athletic in the second row and loose forward position. He scored 10 tries and kicked a conversion. Then on 9 August he played in a Wellington trial match before being picked to play loose forward against Canterbury. Canterbury won the match 30-29. He then played against Auckland at Victoria Park in Auckland before a crowd of 7,500. Wellington went down narrowly 12-11. Wellington then played Wanganui and won 22-6 before then taking on the touring New South Wales side. They lost the match 34-18 at Newtown Park. Wilson's final match of the season was against Auckland who were on tour. It was a slightly weaker Auckland side which even included their manager due to injuries they had sustained in their match with Taranaki days prior. Wellington ran out winners 33-18 in front of 1,800 spectators. This would be Wellington's last victory against Auckland until 1988.\nIn 1914 he played 8 matches for Athletic though they had begun to struggle to field a side by the end of the season along with other club teams due to so many players leaving to join the fight in World War I. Wilson had scored 8 tries in those matches where he was now being used more regularly in the backs. On 3 June he played for Wellington against Hawke's Bay in an 18-9 win where he scored a try. He played in a Wellington trial match as they looked to pick their best side for their match with the touring England team. He scored a try for the A Team in their 12-11 win. The match with England was played at Newtown Park with 5,000 spectators present. Wellington were very competitive and only lost 7-14 to a fully professional side. Wilson then scored a try in a match against Canterbury which they won 13-3. He was picked in the New Zealand side to play England a week later. He then played for Wellington against Hawke's Bay and scored 4 tries in a 62-16 thrashing. His last representative match of the season was against Auckland. Auckland won 10-6 and retained the Northern Union Challenge Cup at Victoria Park, Auckland. Soon after this Wilson enlisted in the army to fight in World War I.\nIn 1919 after Wilson returned from the war he was elected club captain of Athletic. He played 2 matches where he scored 3 tries before he was selected to tour Australia with the New Zealand side. Following the tour he played in 3 more matches for Athletic in August and September. Against Petone B's senior side he ran in 5 tries and kicked a conversion in a 44-0 win. The 1920 season saw him play a very limited amount for Athletic early in the season and no representative football. It is possible that he had moved to Auckland during this season.\nInternational honours.\nBilly Wilson was selected for New Zealand in 1914 against Great Britain. The match was played at the Auckland Domain in front of 15,000 on 1 August. Wilson scored two of New Zealand's tries while playing on the left wing. New Zealand went down by the narrow margin of 16-13. His first try came after Jim Parker intercepted a pass and transferred the ball to Karl Ifwersen who sent it on to Wilson who \"with a great sprint\" scored. Then just before the final whistle Wilson \"snapped up the ball and put a fitting climax to a great game by scoring\".\nIn 1919 he was chosen for the New Zealand tour of Australia. He played in 7 of the tour matches and scored 6 tries with all of his appearances on the wing. He played against Auckland for New Zealand prior to their departure. New Zealand won 25 to 19. His first match in Australia was against New South Wales and saw New Zealand lose 23-18. He played against Tamworth on 11 June in a 21-13 win. He was in try scoring form against New South Wales on 21 June, crossing for 3 tries but it wasn't enough to avoid a 22-19 defeat. He scored New Zealand's second try after he beat the tackle of White and after some fumbling play crossed the line. His own second came after receiving a pass from Bill Williams and he ran over for a try. His third try came when Jim Rukutai passed to Stan Walters who passed to Wilson as he was being tackled. Wilson knocked the ball forward with his knee and followed through to regather and score. This gave New Zealand a 19-11 lead but they fell away to lose the match.\nHis next two games saw a win over Ipswich 11-8 and a loss to Queensland 26-18 on 28 June. His final two matches of the tour were against Rockhampton where he scored twice in a 23-0 win \"by fine play\". For his first try he received the ball near halfway and \"ran across the field at top speed, evading all attempts to stop him coming to the touch line, he retraced his steps infield fending off his tacklers in great style. Near the 25 Harris chased him, but Wilson had too good a start, and continuing he grounded the ball in a favourable position to goal. He scored again after good ball handling from his team mates where he took a pass from Harry Tancred and scored under the posts.\"\nIn his final match of the tour he was part of the New Zealand side which easily won 42-12 over Toowoomba where he scored another try. He took a pass after the ball crossed right across the field and he scored near the posts with Karl Ifwersen converting to give New Zealand a 10-0 lead.\nWilson last represented New Zealand in 1921. He was picked for the New Zealand tour of Australia but only played in the first 3 matches. New Zealand was thrashed 56-9 in the first game against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground before a crowd of 50,000. They then responded by pulling off an upset win two days later against Queensland. He scored a try after he \"sprinted in after having had the ball kicked to him from the centre\". Bill Davidson converted and New Zealand had a 19-0 lead and went on to win 25-12. He then scored another try against the same opponent on 11 June in a 21-16 loss. He had come on as a replacement for Charlie McElwee on a very heavy field due to wet weather and \"ran half the length of the field after receiving from Charles Woolley\". Unfortunately he sustained a bad leg injury and had to leave the field which meant New Zealand had to play with just 12 men for the remainder of the match. This was to be Wilson's last ever match for New Zealand as his injury ruled him out of the remaining 5 matches. The match ultimately turned out to be Wilson's last ever game of rugby league.\nWorld War I, and NZ military rugby teams.\nBilly Wilson stated in his enlistment information that he was a member of the Eastbourne Rifle Club. He departed Wellington, New Zealand for World War I on 14 February 1915. He arrived at Suez in Egypt on 26 March. He was in the Veterinary Corps, part of the 3rd Reinforcements. His brother Ranji Wilson had departed for the war late the previous season. Both listed their mother as living at 70 Hopper Street in Wellington at the time with Billy's marital status said to be \"single\".\nHe was with the Veterinary Corps from December 1914 to March 1915 when he was attached to The New Zealand Army Service Corps, Divisional Train, 1 Company. He was with them during the Gallipoli Campaign and was taken ill suffering from pneumonia while at the Dardanelles on 14 May 1915. He was moved to hospital in Alexandra, Egypt before being discharged on 9 June. He went back to the Dardanelles on 9 July. Then at the end of December 1915 he was attached to the Divisional Train, 2 Company. In January 1916 he then transferred to the Wellington Infantry Regiment.\nAt one point he was a 'runner' in the war, delivering messages. In a letter sent back to New Zealand by Peter McColl he said that Wilson was a \"runner of note and bears a charmed life apparently, judging by the number of stunts he gets into and out of; a runner's life in such times is the reverse of a happy one\". He played regularly for the Wellington Battalion team in matches against other New Zealand teams made up from players stationed in Egypt in 1916. They played against an Otago side and won 15-3, Canterbury where they also won 28-3, and then against an Auckland side with an estimated 3 to 4,000 spectators. The Wellington team won again 14-0 with Wilson scoring 3 of their 4 tries. Wilson then played in the Wellington team again against a Maori side and won a hard match 3-0.\nHe was also picked in the New Zealand Battalion side (nicknamed the Trench Blacks) which was playing in 1916 and 1917. In a letter from Auckland rugby player Colin Murray he said that the team had beaten a British Division team 73-3, and another British Division team 44-0. They then played a Glamorgan side at Richmond, London in December 1916 by 22-0 though it was stated that he did not play in that particular match. Wins followed against a Welsh Division side 18-3,an Irish Division team 49-3, an R.F.C team 82-0, and a Welsh Division team 3-0. His New Zealand team mate Cecil King was also in the squad as was his brother Ranji. Wilson was part of the squad for the Somme Cup match against a French side played in front of tens of thousands however he was a reserve and did not take the field. The New Zealand team won 40-0. A match with a N.Z. Hospital side at Amiens in France.\nWilson was slightly wounded while fighting in France on 7 June 1917 but rejoined his Wellington Infantry Regiment 3 days later.\nIn a letter headed \"France\" and dated 8 August 1918 from a Wellington rugby player had details of it concerning the Wilson brothers was published in the Free Lance newspaper on 10 October that year. He said that \"Arthur (Ranji) Wilson has been having a bad spin lately with a kind of trench fever. I saw him about a month ago. He had just rejoined his unit and was looking fairly well... Billy Wilson is also looking well, and has filled out a good deal\".\nThen in 1919 a letter was received from Peter McColl referring to a period from August to October 1918. He stated that \"\"Billy Wilson\" always turns up like the old cat with the brick around its neck for the First Wellington Battalion, which has never had to acknowledge defeat until our little unit met them the other day. You can take it from me that \"Billy\" has gained and not lost any rugby wisdom, despite war knocks and conditions. He is still the fancy player of his battalion, but is too well watched. Wilson is always dangerous, and his meteoric sprints cause the First Wellingtonians to frisk and cavort with delight and yell for their fancy\".\nAfter returning from the war Wilson was awarded the British War Medal and the Victory Medal.\nReinstatement to rugby.\nIn 1922 Wilson applied for reinstatement back into rugby. It was granted mid-season. He was eligible to play but by this stage he was 33 years old and after serving in the war and suffering from the occasional leg injury he doesn't appear to have played much if any rugby union football.\nIn 1923 it was mentioned that he had joined the Eastbourne rugby club and was helping to coach their third grade side by coaching the forwards.\nDeath.\nBilly Wilson died in Levin on 19 February 1976 aged 86."

The first Rosebuds are notable for being the first American based team to be allowed to compete for the Stanley Cup. The second Rosebuds are notable in that their roster was used to build the NHL expansion Chicago Blackhawks.\nPCHA Portland Rosebuds.\nThe first Portland Rosebuds played in the Pacific Coast Hockey Association from 1914 to 1918. The team was previously known as the New Westminster Royals, an inaugural member of the PCHA in 1911. The team moved to Portland due to poor attendance in New Westminster, British Columbia, and the availability of a larger arena in Portland. In 1916 the Portland Rosebuds won the PCHA championship and briefly held the Stanley Cup, losing it to the Montreal Canadiens in the 1916 Stanley Cup Finals. Their win is memorialized on the Stanley Cup as \"Portland Ore./PCHA Champions/1915–16\" on the 1909 base ring, one of the permanent rings. Portland was the first United States-based team to participate in the Stanley Cup Finals. Portland suspended operations in 1918, and were replaced by the Victoria Aristocrats.\nSeason-by-season record.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against\nWHL Portland Rosebuds.\nThe second Rosebuds team was born when the Regina Capitals moved to Portland for the 1925–26 WHL season.

Frank Patrick then negotiated the sale of the rest of the WHL players to the National Hockey League. The players were to be sold as three teams, one from the Victoria Cougars (who would be sold to Detroit and eventually become the Red Wings), one from the Rosebuds, and a third from the best players from Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver.

        "text": "The Portland Rosebuds, sometimes called the Portland Roses, were a baseball team owned by Jesse Owens. The Rosebuds were part of the West Coast Baseball Association, a Negro league headed by Abe Saperstein, the owner of the Harlem Globetrotters.\nThe Rosebuds played the Seattle Steelheads on their opening day, May 12, 1946, at Dudley Field in El Paso, Texas. They followed opening day with two more days of games in El Paso and one in nearby Ciudad Juárez.\nThe league was disbanded after only two months.\nHistory.\nThe Portland Rosebuds were a part of an all-black baseball league, the West Coast Baseball Association. Previously in 1936, Jesse Owens had made an attempt at promoting another negro league team, but was unsuccessful. When Owens helped start the West Coast Baseball League in 1946, his team, the Portland Rosebuds, was one of six teams in the league. Other teams in the league included the Oakland Larks, San Francisco Sea Lions, San Diego Tigers, and the Los Angeles White Sox.\nThe West Coast Baseball League was created as result of black players being banned from organized leagues. It was one of the last negro leagues to exist and the only one on the West Coast. Abe Saperstein, who famously founded the Harlem Globetrotters, served as the president of the league. Jesse Owens was named vice president of the league.\nSeason.\nThe Portland Rosebuds made their debut in El Paso, Texas, on May 12, 1946, against the Seattle Steelheads. There were a total of three West Coast Baseball League games played in El Paso. Owens played a major role in the promotion of these games and was said to have run against racehorses in between double headers. He also used these appearances to verbalize the importance of education being a ticket to a better life.\nThe Portland Rosebuds played their home games at Vaughn Street Park, home stadium of the local Portland Beavers. Negro Southern League veteran Wesley Barrow was at the helm as manager.\nOn June 4, 1946, the Portland Rosebuds played their first home game at Vaughn Street park against the Los Angeles White Sox. There were 1,500 fans in attendance. By the end of June, the Rosebuds were in second place in the league.    \nRoster.\nNone of the players on the team would go on to play in Major League Baseball.\nDisbandment.\nIt was previously announced that The West Coast Baseball Association would play a full 110-game schedule. However, despite having a strong standing in the league, attendance and news coverage for games suffered. The West Coast Baseball Association, along with the Portland Rosebuds were disbanded in July 1946.\nRevival.\nIn 2021, the Rosebuds were reborn as a collegiate wood bat baseball team that play in the Wild Wild West League."

        "text": "The 2014 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2014 World Cup, the 20th edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at the Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on 13 July 2014, and was contested by Germany and Argentina. The event comprised hosts Brazil and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, Germany finished first in Group G, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Algeria in the round of 16, France in the quarter-final and Brazil, by a score of, in the semi-final. Argentina finished first in Group F with three wins, before defeating Switzerland in the round of 16, Belgium in the quarter-final and the Netherlands in a penalty shoot-out in the semi-final. The final was witnessed by 74,738 spectators in the stadium, as well as over a billion watching on television, with the referee for the match being Nicola Rizzoli from Italy.\nGonzalo Higuaín missed a chance to score for Argentina in the first half when he was one-on-one with Germany goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, and Benedikt Höwedes failed to give Germany the lead shortly before half-time when his shot struck the goalpost. Lionel Messi had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with Neuer shortly after half time, but his low shot went wide of the goal. On 71 minutes, Thomas Müller was through on goal following a build-up involving André Schürrle and Mesut Özil, but he failed to control the ball and lost it to Argentina's goalkeeper, Sergio Romero. With the match goalless after 90 minutes, it went to extra time, in the second period of which Germany broke the deadlock. Mario Götze, who had come on as a substitute shortly before the end of normal time, received Schürrle's cross from the left on his chest before volleying a left-footed shot into the net to secure a 1–0 victory for Germany.\nGermany's win was their fourth World Cup title and the first since German reunification, as well as the first World Cup win by a European team in the Americas. Götze was named the man of the match, and Messi was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. Germany's manager, Joachim Löw, labelled his side's win as the culmination of a project that had begun ten years previously under his predecessor Jürgen Klinsmann, and praised his team's spirit. His Argentine counterpart, Alejandro Sabella, thought his team had been unlucky to lose, and called his players \"warriors\". Germany failed to defend their trophy at the subsequent 2018 World Cup in Russia, becoming the third successive World Cup holders to be eliminated in the group phase after defeats against Mexico and South Korea.\nBackground.\nThe 2014 FIFA World Cup was the 20th edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held in Brazil between 12 June and 13 July 2014. Brazil qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, and 203 teams competed for the remaining 31 spots through qualifying rounds organised by the six FIFA confederations and held between June 2011 and November 2013. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase. The defending champions from the 2010 World Cup were Spain, who had achieved three successive victories in major tournaments, having also won Euro 2008 and Euro 2012. Spain were eliminated in the group phase in the 2014 event.\nGermany had won the title three times before as West Germany – in 1954, 1974 and 1990. Argentina had two titles, in 1978 and 1986. The two sides had met each other six times previously in the World Cup, including in the 1986 final, which Argentina won , and the 1990 final, which West Germany won . They had met in the quarter-final stage of both of the most recent two World Cups, Germany winning both – a penalty-shootout win in 2006 and a win in 2010. Germany lost in the semi-final on both occasions. The most recent meeting between the two teams before the 2014 World Cup was a friendly match played on 15 August 2012 at Commerzbank-Arena in Frankfurt, which was won by Argentina .\nThe venue for the final was announced in 2011 as the Estádio Jornalista Mário Filho in Rio de Janeiro, commonly known as the Maracanã Stadium. It was built in preparation for the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and that tournament's final match, in which Uruguay beat Brazil to win the trophy, is the record-holder for the highest attendance at any football match in history. The Maracanã also hosted the finals of the Copa América in 1989, 2019 and 2021; the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup final; and both the men's and women's football finals at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The stadium underwent an extensive rebuild before the 2014 World Cup, after which its capacity was 78,838.\nThe match ball for the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, announced on 29 May 2014, was a variation of the Adidas Brazuca named the \"Adidas Brazuca Final Rio\". Though the technical aspects of the ball were the same, the design was different from the Brazuca balls used in the group phase and prior knockout games, with a green, gold and black coloring. It was the third ball released specifically for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the Teamgeist Berlin (2006) and the Jo'bulani (2010).\nRoute to the final.\nGermany.\nGermany were drawn in Group G for the World Cup, in which they were joined by Ghana, Portugal and the United States. Their first match was against Portugal, on 16 June 2014 at the Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova in Salvador. Germany won a penalty on 10 minutes, when João Pereira fouled Mario Götze. Müller took the kick and gave Germany the lead. Mats Hummels added a second goal with a header on 32 minutes, and Portugal's Pepe was shown a red card five minutes later, after he headbutted Müller. Müller then scored his second in injury time to give Germany a 3–0 half-time lead. Müller scored a third from close range in the second half, to complete a 4–0 victory, after Rui Patrício had failed to clear a cross by André Schürrle. Germany's second game was against Ghana at the Estádio Castelão in Fortaleza. After a goalless first half, Götze opened the scoring on 51 minutes, when his headed shot from a Müller cross bounced off his own knee and past Ghana's goalkeeper Fatau Dauda. Ghana equalised shortly afterwards, through an André Ayew header, and then took the lead when Sulley Muntari found Asamoah Gyan with a pass, after an error by Manuel Neuer. Germany levelled the game again on 71 minutes, when Miroslav Klose, who had come on as a substitute, kicked Benedikt Höwedes's goal-bound header into the goal from close range. Klose's goal equalled the Brazilian Ronaldo's World Cup record of 15 goals, and the game finished 2–2. Germany's last group game was against the United States at Itaipava Arena Pernambuco in Recife, with a win or draw needed to guarantee qualification. In rainy conditions, Müller scored the only goal of the game with a shot inside the penalty area after goalkeeper Tim Howard had saved Per Mertesacker's header. Germany qualified as group winners.\nGermany's opponents in the round of 16 were Algeria, with the match played on 30 June at the Estádio Beira-Rio in Porto Alegre. The game was tied at 0–0 after 90 minutes, Germany being described by BBC Sport's David Ornstein as looking frequently \"rattled\" as \"Algeria wasted a succession of chances in an opening, exciting encounter\". Germany took the lead early in extra time, when Müller crossed from the left and Schürrle scored from close range. Mesut Özil added a second for Germany in the final minute of extra time, before Abdelmoumene Djabou pulled a goal back for Algeria with a volley in injury time. Germany held on to record a 2–1 win.\n They then faced France in the quarter-final at the Maracanã Stadium on 4 July. Hummels gave Germany the lead on 12 minutes with a header, following a free kick by Toni Kroos, and that proved to be the only goal of what Ornstein described as a \"comfortable\" win. Germany faced tournament hosts Brazil in their semi-final game, on 8 July in Belo Horizonte. In a result described by BBC Sport's Phil McNulty in 2019 as \"a drama ... that will never be forgotten by anyone who witnessed it\", Germany won the game 7–1, inflicting Brazil's first competitive defeat at home for 39 years. They took the lead on 10 minutes, when Müller scored from a corner, unmarked by any Brazil players. They doubled their lead on 22 minutes through Klose, with his record-breaking 16th World Cup goal, before Kroos made it 3–0 on 25 minutes with a left-footed volley. Kroos scored again 179 seconds later, from an assist by Sami Khedira, before Khedira himself scored to make it 5–0 at half time. Schürrle scored twice in the second half to make it 7–0, before Oscar scored Brazil's sole goal shortly before the end. Simon Burnton of \"The Guardian\" later described Germany's play as being \"of a savagery unwitnessed against significant opposition in the tournament's history\". Germany progressed to their eighth final, 12 years after their last and their second since German reunification.\nArgentina.\nArgentina were drawn in Group F, alongside Bosnia and Herzegovina, Iran and Nigeria. Their opening game took place on 15 June 2014 against Bosnia and Herzegovina, who were making their World Cup debut. It was the first game of the tournament at the Maracanã Stadium. Argentina took the lead on 3 minutes, when Bosnian defender Sead Kolašinac scored an own goal after a free kick by Lionel Messi had been flicked on by Marcos Rojo. In the second half, Messi scored himself to double Argentina's lead with a powerful shot following a one-two with Gonzalo Higuaín. Vedad Ibišević scored for Bosnia and Herzegovina with 6 minutes remaining, but Argentina held on for a 2–1 win. Their second game was against Iran at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte on 21 June. Barney Ronay of \"The Guardian\" described Iran as producing a \"stirring performance against an Argentina team of all the attacking talents\", and the match remained goalless until the 90th minute. Argentina took the win in injury time, when Messi scored a left-footed shot into the corner from outside the penalty area to seal qualification for the next round with a game to spare. Their final group game was on 25 June, against Nigeria in Porto Alegre. Messi gave Argentina the lead on 3 minutes, scoring on the rebound after Ángel Di María's shot hit the goalpost. Ahmed Musa equalised for Nigeria a minute later with a right-footed curling shot, before Messi gave Argentina the lead again with a free kick from out shortly before half time. Musa equalised once again 2 minutes into the second half, hitting the ball past goalkeeper Sergio Romero after a one-two with Emmanuel Emenike, but Rojo scored with his knee 3 minutes later to seal a 3–2 win and first place in the final group table.\nArgentina's round-of-16 opponents were Switzerland, on 1 July at the Arena Corinthians in São Paulo. Argentina had the majority of the possession during the game, but BBC Sport's Jonathan Jurejko labelled their play \"unconvincing\", citing their failure to break down a Switzerland side who were playing defensively. There were no goals during normal time, and it remained 0–0 until 2 minutes before the end of extra time when Messi set up Di María to score the winner past Swiss goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. Substitute Blerim Džemaili almost equalised for Switzerland immediately afterwards with a shot that hit the goalpost, but Argentina held on for a 1–0 win. Their quarter-final was against Belgium at the Estádio Nacional Mané Garrincha in Brasília on 5 July. Argentina scored the only goal of the game on 8 minutes through Higuaín, who scored from the edge of the penalty area after Di María's pass was deflected off Belgium's Jan Vertonghen. Argentina played the Netherlands in the semi-final on 9 July. There were no goals in the game, in either normal time or extra time, in what McNulty described as \"120 tedious ... minutes that were in stark contrast to the spectacular shock\" of the previous day's semi-final between Brazil and Germany. Ron Vlaar of the Netherlands took the first penalty, a low shot to the right, which was saved by Romero. The next three kicks, by Messi, Arjen Robben and Ezequiel Garay, were all scored, before Romero made another save, diving to his right to keep out a high penalty from Wesley Sneijder. Sergio Agüero, Dirk Kuyt and Maxi Rodríguez all scored their penalties, giving Argentina a 4–2 shoot-out win. The press in Argentina called Romero's two saves the \"hands of God\", a reference to the \"hand of God\" goal scored by Diego Maradona in 1986. Argentina progressed to their fifth final, which was also their first since 1990.\nMatch.\nPre-match.\nNicola Rizzoli, from Italy, was named as the referee of the final, together with fellow Italians Renato Faverani and Andrea Stefani as the assistant referees, and Carlos Vera and Christian Lescano from Ecuador as the fourth and fifth officials. Earlier in the 2014 World Cup, Rizzoli took charge of the Spain–Netherlands and Nigeria–Argentina matches in the group stage, and the Argentina–Belgium quarter-final. He had previously taken charge of the 2010 UEFA Europa League Final and the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. He was also one of the referees at the 2011 FIFA Club World Cup, UEFA Euro 2012 and the 2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup. He became the third Italian referee to take charge of a World Cup final, after Sergio Gonella in 1978 and Pierluigi Collina in 2002.\nA closing ceremony for the World Cup took place about an hour and forty minutes before the final. A performance of two acts, the ceremony lasted about 20 minutes. The first act featured 22 samba dancers and a host of other performers, 32 of the dancers wearing dresses decorated in the colours of each of the participating teams. The second act featured musical performances headlined by Colombian singer Shakira, and included singers Carlinhos Brown, Wyclef Jean, Alexandre Pires and Ivete Sangalo as well as guitarist Carlos Santana. Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bündchen and Carles Puyol, a member of Spain's winning team in 2010, unveiled the FIFA World Cup Trophy.\nBrazilian president Dilma Rousseff was present at the final, along with Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose country hosted the next World Cup, and Jacob Zuma, the President of South Africa, the previous hosts. Representing the finalists, German president Joachim Gauck and chancellor Angela Merkel were in attendance, although Argentina's president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner could not attend because of both her grandson's birthday and a case of pharyngo-laryngitis. Other world leaders present included Viktor Orbán of Hungary, Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon and Antigua and Barbuda's Gaston Browne. Several celebrities and athletes also attended the final, including Rihanna, Daniel Craig, Mick Jagger, Ashton Kutcher, David Beckham, Tom Brady, Olivier Dacourt, LeBron James, and Christian Vieri. Former World Cup winners like Fabio Cannavaro, Lothar Matthäus, Daniel Passarella, Marco Materazzi and Pelé were present as well. Brazilian spectators at the game were largely supportive of the Germans as a result of the Argentina–Brazil football rivalry, despite their team's heavy semi-final loss.\nGermany were forced to make a late change to their line-up when Khedira sustained a calf injury during the warm-up before the match. He was replaced in the line-up by Christoph Kramer, with Germany's team otherwise unchanged from that which started in their win over Brazil in the semi-final. Argentina began the match with the identical team to that which started their semi-final against the Netherlands.\nFirst half.\nGermany kicked off the match at 4 pm local time (7 pm UTC) in temperatures of with 65% humidity, in front of a crowd of 74,738 and an estimated global television audience of 1.013 billion. The weather at Santos Dumont Airport, from the stadium, was recorded as fair at the time of kick-off, becoming partly cloudy later in the evening. Germany won a free kick 3 minutes into the game, when Rojo fouled Müller around from the Argentina goal. The free kick was hit straight at the wall, and Argentina launched a counterattack from the rebound. Pablo Zabaleta ran with the ball down the right before passing to Higuaín on the edge of the penalty area. He took a shot from a narrow angle, but the ball went wide of Neuer's left-hand goalpost. On 9 minutes, Messi outpaced Hummels on the Argentina right and ran into the penalty area. He attempted to find Ezequiel Lavezzi from the byline but Schweinsteiger reached it first and cleared. Germany had considerably more of the early possession, but a German defensive error on 20 minutes gave Argentina what Jerry Hinnen of CBS Sports called \"the best opportunity for either side\" thus far. Kroos miscued a header, which left Higuaín one-on-one with Neuer, but the latter's shot from the edge of the penalty area went wide of the goal. On 23 minutes, Klose had a chance to score when the ball reached him following a cross by Philipp Lahm, but Zabaleta dispossessed him before he could shoot.\nIn the 30th minute, Lavezzi found space for Argentina on the right and crossed into the penalty area. Higuaín collected the ball and slotted it past Neuer into the goal. He celebrated for several seconds, but the strike was disallowed as he had been in an offside position. Germany made a substitution shortly afterwards, taking off Kramer as a result of a head injury he had sustained 14 minutes previously. He was replaced by Schürrle. Höwedes received a yellow card on 33 minutes for a tackle which connected with Zabaleta's shins, before Messi had a shot blocked by Schweinsteiger. A minute later, Germany launched an attack down the left through Müller, who passed to Schürrle. He hit a shot towards the top left of the goal, but Romero did a full-stretch dive to save it, despite having his eyeline blocked by Özil. Messi then had another opportunity, running with the ball into the Germany penalty area and kicking the ball towards goal. Jérôme Boateng prevented Argentina taking the lead with a goal-line clearance. Shortly before half time, Höwedes received a Kroos corner in the penalty area, in what reporters for UEFA called the \"best chance of the half\", but his headed shot from an offside position struck the goalpost and it remained 0–0 at half time.\nSecond half.\nArgentina began the second half with Agüero on the field in place of Lavezzi. Higuaín had a shot in the first minute of the half after running down the right wing, but it went wide of Neuer's goal. Messi then had an opportunity to score when he was one-on-one with the goalkeeper a minute later, but his low shot on goal also went wide. Argentina had more possession than Germany in the opening 10 minutes of the half, and they had another chance on 50 minutes when Higuaín received a ball just inside the penalty area; he missed the ball with his attempted shot. In the 56th minute, Neuer took down Higuaín in the penalty area, but no penalty was given, despite Argentine commentators believing it should be given. No card was given either. Klose had Germany's first shot on goal of the second half on 59 minutes but his shot lacked power and was caught by Romero. Argentina had an opportunity to score through a Martín Demichelis header four minutes later, but Klose intercepted to send it behind. Shortly afterwards, Javier Mascherano brought down Klose after losing the ball to him, and was booked. His team-mate Agüero was also booked a minute later for a foul on Schweinsteiger. Midway through the second half, \"The Guardian\" Scott Murray commented that the first half had been \"goalless and brilliant\", but the second was \"goalless and ... well, not so much\", although he noted that it remained an open game.\nGermany had a chance on 71 minutes, Müller, Schürrle and Özil all getting involved in a build-up which Murray described as \"tiki-taka\", but when Schürrle eventually reached the penalty area with only Romero to beat, he failed to control the ball properly and the goalkeeper claimed it. Messi had a shot on 75 minutes, following a run across the edge of the German penalty area, which he attempted to curl into the top left-hand corner of the goal; it missed the target. Germany appealed for a penalty with 10 minutes remaining, after a tussle close to the Argentina goalpost following a Lahm cross, but the referee awarded a goal kick to Argentina. Kroos then had a chance for Germany following a lay-off pass by Özil, but he again missed the target. Both sides made substitutions in the final 5 minutes – Fernando Gago replacing Enzo Pérez for Argentina, and Götze came on for Klose for Germany. This represented Klose's last appearance for Germany, and he remains the most prolific goalscorer for any country in World Cup history. The final remained goalless after 90 minutes, and extra time was played.\nExtra time.\nEarly in the first half of extra time, Schürrle received a pass in front of goal from Götze, but his close-range shot was stopped by Romero. This was followed by a break upfield by Messi and Agüero with only two defenders covering, but Boateng was able to intercept and clear the danger. Five minutes later, a lob by Rodrigo Palacio over Neuer went just wide after the forward jumped on a mistake by Hummels in the German penalty area. At the halfway point in extra time, Murray wrote that Argentina were \"offering very little up front\" and speculated that many of the players might be \"thinking about penalties already\". Alan Tyers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" noted that Messi did not \"look quite the ticket\" and that he had not been playing well since half time. In the second half of extra time, Germany broke the deadlock when Götze scored in the 113th minute. Schürrle raced past two defenders on the left before crossing into the penalty area, where Götze controlled the ball on his chest and then volleyed left-footed into the net. Müller had a chance to double Germany's lead shortly afterward when he dribbled past two defenders, but his shot across the net was too wide. Late in extra time, Messi had an opportunity to equalise from a free kick within goal-scoring distance, but his attempt flew high over the crossbar. That proved to be the last action of the game as the final whistle was blown, confirming Germany's 1–0 victory.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules:\nPost-match.\nGermany's victory marked the first World Cup win by a European team in the Americas, as well as the third successive European triumph after Italy and Spain's wins in 2006 and 2010. President Rousseff of Brazil delivered the trophy to German captain Philipp Lahm during the awards ceremony on the stands. Alongside her during the trophy handover was FIFA president Sepp Blatter. As Lahm raised the trophy, the outro of the tournament's official song \"We Are One (Ole Ola)\" was played. The goalscorer Götze was named as the official man of the match for the final, despite playing only the last two minutes of normal time and thirty minutes of extra time. Messi was awarded the Golden Ball, FIFA's award for whom they considered the tournament's best player, and Neuer was given the Golden Glove for best goalkeeper.\nJoachim Löw, the manager of Germany, labelled his side's win as the culmination of a project which had begun ten years previously under his predecessor Jürgen Klinsmann. Speaking after the game, Löw said: \"We'd not made this ultimate step before, but champions do what they will do. This team has developed a spirit which is unbelievable.\" His Argentine counterpart, Alejandro Sabella, praised his players, describing them as \"warriors\", and felt that they had been unlucky to lose. He said that his team had had the better chances \"but we didn't take them, and we only had to last another five minutes or so to reach penalties. The pain is immense.\" Götze expressed a sense of disbelief at his scoring of the winning goal, having not had the opportunity to play for much of the tournament. He said: \"You score the goal and you don't really know what's happening. It hasn't been a simple tournament, or year, for me and I owe a lot to my family and my girlfriend who always believed in me. But a dream became reality here.\"\nThe German press praised the team for their overall performance in the tournament, contrasting it with the team's poor form a decade earlier. Christian Gödecke, writing in \"Der Spiegel\" wrote \"Now Germany is world champion, and German football is barely recognisable. It's the perfect mix of virtue and magic, of hurrah and heave ho.\" Writers in the \"Süddeutsche Zeitung\" described the final as a \"fitting punchline\" to the tournament, while noting that \"There won't be debates like there were in Rome in 1990, when the penalty that Andreas Brehme netted for the 1–0 victory was controversial and triggered conspiracy theories against Fifa amongst the Argentinians\". In Argentina, the press were downbeat but also indicated their pride in the team's achievement, with many newspapers featuring a front-page picture of Messi after the match, alone or with his teammates. Newspaper \"Clarín\" lamented the team's missed chances and their denied penalty appeal. Ezequiel Fernández Moores of \"La Nacion\" thought Germany the deserved winners, and believed the referee correct in denying Higuaín's penalty appeal. The host country's rivalry with Argentina continued to feature in the Brazilian press after the game, sports daily \"Lance!\" using the headline \"Tell Me How You Feel Now\" in response to Argentine mocking of Brazil throughout the tournament. Speaking on his TV show, Maradona responded to this by contrasting Argentina's one-goal defeat to the 7–1 loss suffered by Brazil. A photograph by Chinese photographer Bao Tailiang of the \"Chengdu Economic Daily\", showing Messi staring at the World Cup Trophy after Argentina's defeat, won the Sports Singles award at the 2015 World Press Photo of the Year contest.\nGermany's next major tournament was UEFA Euro 2016, in which they reached the semi-final before losing 2–0 to France. At the subsequent 2018 World Cup in Russia, Germany failed to advance from the group phase, finishing bottom of their group behind Sweden, Mexico and South Korea. Germany secured only one win at the tournament, over Sweden, and lost to Mexico and South Korea, becoming the third successive World Cup holders to be eliminated without reaching the knock-outs for the first time since 1938. Argentina's next major tournament was the 2015 Copa América, where they reached the final but were defeated by Chile in a penalty shoot-out, followed by a rematch at the 2016 Copa América at the final where they would also lose to them in a penalty shoot-out. In the 2018 World Cup, they advanced from their group in second place behind Croatia, before being beaten in the round of 16 by France. Argentina eventually won their third World Cup with victory against France in the 2022 FIFA World Cup final."

        "title": "2012 England rugby union tour of South Africa",
        "text": "In June 2012, the England national rugby union team went on a three-test tour against the South Africa national rugby union team, known colloquially and referred to hereafter as the \"Springboks\". This was one of a series of mid-year tours in 2012 by northern teams to be hosted by southern hemisphere nations.\nThe series was among the first to mark a return to the format of traditional tours, after the International Rugby Board (IRB) decided in 2010 to revive the concept, which could include mid-week matches against representative or club sides. This was first such tour since South Africa had hosted New Zealand in 1996.\nEngland last toured South Africa in 2007 and played two test matches, losing both 58 – 10 and 55 – 22. The last time the two sides met was in 2010 at Twickenham, when the Springboks won 21 – 11, marking their seventh straight win against England. Leading up to this series, both nations had played each other 32 times. The Springboks had won 19 games, England 12, and one had been drawn. England's last win against the Springboks was in 2006, when they won 23 – 21 at Twickenham. Their last victory in South Africa came in 2000, when they triumphed in Bloemfontein 27 – 22.\nSquads.\nEngland.\nOn 10 May, England coach Stuart Lancaster announced his initial 42-man squad for the tour to South Africa consisting of 23 forwards and 19 backs. Thirteen uncapped players were included in the squad.\nForwards: Mouritz Botha (Saracens), Dan Cole (Leicester Tigers), Alex Corbisiero (London Irish), Paul Doran-Jones (Northampton Saints), Phil Dowson (Northampton Saints), Carl Fearns (Bath Rugby), Joe Gray (Harlequins), Dylan Hartley (Northampton Saints), James Haskell (Highlanders), Tom Johnson (Exeter Chiefs), Graham Kitchener (Leicester Tigers), Joe Launchbury (London Wasps), Joe Marler (Harlequins), Lee Mears (Bath Rugby), Ben Morgan (Scarlets), Matt Mullan (Worcester Warriors), Tom Palmer (Stade Français), Geoff Parling (Leicester Tigers), Chris Robshaw (\"captain\", Harlequins), George Robson (Harlequins), Matt Stevens (Saracens), Thomas Waldrom (Leicester Tigers), Tom Youngs (Leicester Tigers)\nBacks: Anthony Allen (Leicester Tigers), Chris Ashton (Northampton Saints), Brad Barritt (Saracens), Mike Brown (Harlequins), Danny Care (Harlequins), Lee Dickson (Northampton Saints), Owen Farrell (Saracens), Toby Flood (Leicester Tigers), Ben Foden (Northampton Saints), Alex Goode (Saracens), Charlie Hodgson (Saracens), Jonathan Joseph (London Irish), George Lowe (Harlequins), Ugo Monye (Harlequins), David Strettle (Saracens), Manu Tuilagi (Leicester Tigers), Jordan Turner-Hall (Harlequins), Christian Wade (London Wasps), Ben Youngs (Leicester Tigers)\nSouth Africa.\nOn 2 June, new Springbok head coach Heyneke Meyer announced his squad of 32 players for the series. Nine uncapped players were included in the squad.\nForwards: Willem Alberts (), Marcell Coetzee (The Sharks), Keegan Daniel (The Sharks), Bismarck du Plessis (The Sharks), Jannie du Plessis (The Sharks), Eben Etzebeth (Western Province), Ryan Kankowski (The Sharks), Juandré Kruger (Blue Bulls), Werner Kruger (Blue Bulls), Tendai Mtawarira (The Sharks), Coenie Oosthuizen (Free State Cheetahs), Jacques Potgieter (Blue Bulls), Chiliboy Ralepelle (Blue Bulls), Pierre Spies (Blue Bulls), Adriaan Strauss (Free State Cheetahs), Flip van der Merwe (Blue Bulls), Franco van der Merwe (Golden Lions)\nBacks: Bjorn Basson (Blue Bulls), Jean de Villiers (Western Province), JJ Engelbrecht (Blue Bulls), Bryan Habana (Western Province), Francois Hougaard (Blue Bulls), Elton Jantjies (Golden Lions), Zane Kirchner (Blue Bulls), Patrick Lambie (), Lwazi Mvovo (The Sharks), Wynand Olivier (Blue Bulls), Ruan Pienaar (Ulster), JP Pietersen (The Sharks), François Steyn (The Sharks), Morné Steyn (Blue Bulls), Jano Vermaak (Blue Bulls)\nMatch reports.\nFirst Test – 9 June.\n\"For the match scorecard, see Week 3 of the 2012 mid-year test series: South Africa vs. England.\"\nThe First Test of the series was played at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. The event was a historic occasion, because it was the first time that England and South Africa had played each other in Durban; England had played at Kings Park during the 1995 Rugby World Cup, but they did not face South Africa in the tournament. In the 27 test matches the Springboks had played there since 1962, they had won 16 matches, lost 8 and drawn 3.\nThe Springboks named three uncapped players in the starting line-up: locks Eben Etzebeth and Juandré Kruger, and flanker Marcell Coetzee. Uncapped prop Coenie Oosthuizen was named on the bench.\nEngland selected two uncapped players to make their debut in the starting line-up: flanker Tom Johnson and prop Joe Marler. Uncapped back Jonathan Joseph was named on the bench.\nThis then was how the teams lined up for the match:\nFirst half.\nThere was heavy rain in Durban which eased before kick-off, as well as a blustery wind. As expected, both sides went in hard early. England looked composed enough, managing to repel a Springbok line-out from inside their 22 after they failed to handle Morné Steyn's kick-off. But a box kick from Youngs carried too far and ended up in the hands of speedy wing Habana, who slipped several tackles before being finally brought down on halfway. That moment aside, England's determination paid off when, six minutes in, the debutant Etzebeth was penalised for not rolling away after the tackle. Farrell converted the 40-metre penalty goal to open the scoring, 3 – 0. The home side finally came to life ten minutes into the match, and with 14 minutes gone on the clock, Morné Steyn levelled the scores from point-blank range 3 – 3 when England was penalised for being offside after some strong running by Sharks flanker Alberts. England continued to resist attack after attack from the Springboks, especially when, at the 20-minute mark, Hougaard found space in attack and passed to Spies, who was tackled by Tuilagi just inches short of the tryline. \nFinally, in a rare foray forward, Johnson, who impressed many observers on debut with his work rate, drew the defence before he passed to the number eight Morgan, who powered his way through South Africa's defence. Coetzee interfered illegally for the Springboks, and Farrell converted the subsequent penalty to regain the lead for England 6 – 3 at the 27-minute mark of the match. South Africa replied swiftly after England was again penalised for being offside. Steyn converted the penalty to again level the scores 6 – 6.\nHabana then injured himself when he chased a high kick from Morne Steyn and collided with England fullback Brown. A big chance for England went begging when Youngs found Ashton in midfield, who sidestepped Kirchner and took the ball up 30 metres only to spill it as he was brought down from behind by Hougaard. A series of deep kicks ensued as both sides tried to establish territory. In the final minute of the half, Johnson was penalised for using his hands in a scrum, but Steyn's penalty attempt drifted wide to leave the teams even at 6 – 6 at half time.\nSecond half.\nThe Springboks made two changes to their team during the break. Habana came back on and Lambie replaced Kirchner, who was suffering from a knee problem serious enough to rule him out of the next test. England made no changes. England made a promising start after Youngs found a gap in the Springbok defence. But South Africa struck the first blow when Morné Steyn dotted down in the right corner in the 47th minute after he had been involved in the attacking build-up that featured a storming run by Jannie du Plessis. Steyn's conversion attempt was just wide, so the score remained 11 – 6.\nThe Springboks wasted a chance to score again several minutes later. After they were awarded a penalty deep in England's 22, Hougaard chose to tap and go instead of letting M. Steyn take the kick for a penalty goal. The English then managed to turn the ball over. Flood was brought on to replace Barritt, who sustained an eye injury. There was a minor flare-up on the touchline between De Villiers and Farrell, but that was quickly sorted out by the officials. \nHougaard was replaced by Pienaar. Habana showed he was suffering no ill-effects from his first half injury, twice nearly getting through England's defence. The Springboks finally broke through again when they so severely disrupted an England scrum that Youngs was forced to clear under pressure. Habana caught the ball and ran it straight back. From the resultant ruck, the Springboks quickly spread the ball wide for captain De Villiers to cut inside and touch down in the right corner, making the score 16 – 6. But again, Steyn missed the conversion attempt, this time spraying it across the posts.\nLancaster replaced Morgan with Dowson, and England's reply was almost immediate. The Springboks misjudged the kick-off, which allowed Foden to intercept the ball and race towards the tryline. Again, the Springboks managed to scramble and again, Habana hurt himself, this time colliding with Frans Steyn. Referee Walsh penalised the Springboks for offside and Farrell slotted the penalty to take the score to 16 – 9.\nBut England was not finished yet. Barely two minutes later, England captain Robshaw managed to isolate Pietersen in a ruck and win a penalty for his team. Farrell duly converted and suddenly, with the score 16 – 12 with less than 15 minutes to go, the game was again up for grabs.\nStrauss came on for Bismarck du Plessis at hooker, and had an immediate impact. The Springboks seized back the momentum and swept forward, with Strauss, Pienaar and Coetzee prominent. Tuilagi was penalised for offside and Steyn, after three consecutive misses, nailed the penalty to restore the seven-point gap. The score was now 19 – 12 with ten minutes remaining.\nBoth sides made changes: for England, Dickson came on for Youngs; for South Africa, Daniel replaced Coetzee. England tried to create chances, most notably when Tuilagi again bumped De Villiers off whilst going forward. But there was no support and he was penalised for continuing to play the ball after being brought to ground.\nThe killer blow for England came when they had a scrum feed in their half at the 75-minute mark. The Springbok forwards timed their shove perfectly, causing England to buckle under pressure and thus earning a scrum feed. On the resultant scrum, Doran-Jones, who was just brought on for Marler, was penalised for collapsing the scrum. Steyn converted the penalty to put the game, with the score 22 – 12 and only two minutes remaining, virtually out of England's reach.\nNevertheless, England continued to fight. Joseph was brought on for Brown and, despite the limited game time, was involved in the movement which led to the try that England needed when Foden scored in the corner. However, it was too little too late. Farrell's attempted conversion after the hooter sailed wide. So the final score was 22 – 17. The Springboks had drawn first blood and led the series one-nil.\nSecond Test – 16 June.\n\"For the match scorecard, see Week 4 of the 2012 mid-year test series: South Africa vs. England.\"\nThe Second Test was played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg. This would be the third time that England and South Africa had played each other at the venue. The previous occasion the two sides had met at Ellis Park was back in 1984 when the Springboks won 35 – 9 courtesy of a hat-trick to Danie Gerber. However, England had claimed one of their few precious wins in South Africa at this venue back in 1972, when they won 18 – 9. In the 43 test matches the Springboks had played at Ellis Park since 1928, they had won 30 matches, lost 11 and drawn 2.\nThe Springboks made three changes to their match squad: Patrick Lambie replaced the injured Kirchner at fullback, and Bjorn Basson was called up to fill the vacant replacement spot. Werner Kruger was also called up to cover for the injured Coenie Oosthuizen.\nEngland made more changes to the starting XV, some of the changes forced due to injury. Most of the changes occurred in the backline; Ben Foden replaced the injured Mike Brown at fullback, and Jonathan Joseph was given his first Test start after Brad Barritt was sidelined with a lacerated eyeball. This also meant that Manu Tuilagi was shifted from outside centre to inside centre to accommodate Joseph at number 13. Foden's shift to fullback meant David Strettle was handed a starting berth on the wing. Toby Flood replaced Owen Farrell at fly-half. Up front the only change was the inclusion of Thomas Waldrom after Phil Dowson was sent home with a hamstring injury.\nThe line-ups for both teams were then as follows:"

        "title": "Cardiff Cricket Club",
        "text": "Cardiff Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Whitchurch, Cardiff, Wales. It was established in 1819 and forms the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club with its headquarters at Cardiff Arms Park. The first team plays in the South Wales Premier Cricket League. It is one of the oldest sporting organisations in the whole of Wales.\nHistory.\nCardiff Cricket Club was established in 1819. The club initially played on various cricket grounds, mostly in eastern Cardiff, due to better drainage. The club then moved to Cardiff Arms Park, but it was more of a gentlemen's club, rather than a sports club. By 1867 the Bute Estate agreed that the cricket club could rent the eastern part of the Arms Park at only one shilling per annum. By April 1875 the Bute Estate decided to restrict access to the Arms Park to Cardiff Cricket Club and other recognised clubs.\nIn 1922 Cardiff Football Club, later renamed Cardiff Rugby Football Club and Cardiff Cricket Club amalgamated to form the Cardiff Athletic Club. There had been previous attempts to merge the clubs, in November 1892 and between 1902 and 1904, when the two clubs worked closely to fund a new pavilion to serve the needs of both clubs, but it was not until 1922 that the merger finally took place. Later the Cardiff Arms Park Company Limited was formed by Cardiff Athletic Club, Arms Park (Cardiff) Greyhound Racing Company Limited and the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) acquired the land from the Bute Estate for £30,000 (GBP), but on the understanding that the Arms Park was only used for recreational purposes and was not sold for building. The cricket section of the Athletic Club acquired a 99 lease from the company at a rental of £200 per annum, with Glamorgan County Cricket Club paying rent for the use of the park for county cricket.\nThe existing wooden cricket and rugby pavilion had been demolished and new changing rooms included in the new North Stand. In 1937 a new cricket pavilion was built for the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club. By the mid 1950s improvements meant that the capacity of the cricket ground had increased to around 15,000, although the ground was still very small and often visiting teams agreed to the boundaries being shortened so that people could sit on the grass. Cardiff Athletic Club however wanted to develop new facilities for both the bowls and tennis sections, and did not allow new seating to be erected just for county games. A new scheme was developed to change the existing rugby ground into the National Stadium, and creating a smaller ground for Cardiff R.F.C. on the existing cricket ground, with the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club moving to Sophia Gardens. Cardiff Cricket Club played their final game at Cardiff Arms Park against Lydney Cricket Club on 17 September 1966.\nIn 1998, Cardiff Athletic Club sold the Sophia Gardens ground to Glamorgan County Cricket Club and the cricket section of Cardiff Athletic Club (Cardiff Cricket Club) for many years had no fixed cricket ground, while they were looking for a suitable cricket ground. In 1997 the club moved to their permanent home of the Diamond cricket ground at Forest Farm, Whitchurch, Cardiff and by July 2007 a new pavilion had been built on the ground.\nCardiff Cricket Club have won the South Wales Premier Cricket League in both 2009 and 2011."

        "text": "The 2012–13 Atlantic 10 Conference men's basketball season marks the 37th season of Atlantic 10 Conference basketball. The season marks the first for new members Butler and VCU, and the last for departing members Temple and Charlotte. The 2013 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament will be held for the first time at Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York.\nPreseason.\nPrior to the season, the Atlantic 10 welcomed new members, Butler and VCU. The two schools joined the conference immediately, rather than waiting a season as Butler initially intended, because they \"weren't going to be allowed to play in the respective conference tournaments.\" With the addition of these programs, the conference sits at 16 teams for one year, yet the conference slate stayed at 16 games. \"The league had to be creative with its schedule knowing that it would be for only one season. Every team will play each team once with one rivalry game twice.\"\nThe conference moved the conference tournament to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York, after six seasons in Atlantic City. Analysts predict \"the league's Big Apple debut might result in a record number of bids for this stacked conference.\" The contract lasts for five years. \"I just think it's going to be a rebirth of college basketball in New York,\" said Fordham coach Tom Pecora, who was born in the borough.\nFor the 2012–13 season, Butler lost Ronald Nored to graduation and Chrishawn Hopkins to a violation of team rules, but returned nearly every other significant player and added key players in transfer Rotnei Clarke and freshman Kellen Dunham.\nCharlotte's Chris Braswell \"might be the best big man in the league, and the 49ers have a good recruiting class entering the fold.\" Dayton's frontcourt garnered press for its depth, with Kevin Dillard returning as point guard, along with transfers Vee Sanford and Matt Derenbecker.\n\"Va. Tech transfer Tyrone Garland joins a loaded perimeter group\" at La Salle, and Massachusetts \"could be a title threat\" with point guard Chaz Williams, who returned along with three other starters following a run to the NIT semifinals.\n2012 A10 tournament champion Saint Bonaventure faced potential struggle after the loss of Andrew Nicholson, who \"was a dominant force throughout his career.\" However, the Bonnies returned Marquise Simmons and Michael Davenport from injuries. Saint Joseph's returned everyone \"from a team that was in the mix for an NCAA bid until late.\"\nSaint Louis was the favorite among many analysts because, although it lost Brian Conklin, the team returned Kwamain Mitchell and \"locks down on D.\" The Billikens are without coach Rick Majerus, who \"is taking a leave of absence for health reasons.\" Majerus died on December 1, 2012, prompting Commissioner Bernadette McGlade's statement, \"The entire Atlantic 10 family is grieving tonight over the loss of coach Majerus. His undeniable knowledge and love of the game was known to all, and he was an excellent teacher committed to the student-athlete. This passion made his impact on A-10 basketball over the past five years immeasurable. He will be missed at Saint Louis , within the A-10 and nationally; our prayers and condolences are with coach Majerus’\nfamily and the Saint Louis University community.\"\nPerpetual favorites Temple and Xavier both lost \"key weapons\" but neither were expected to have a \"huge drop\" as Temple's \"Scootie Randall will be healthy [and] Khalif Wyatt is back\" and Xavier adds Semaj Christon and Isaiah Philmore. However, Xavier lost all of its starters and half of its \"highly regarded recruiting class (Myles Davis and Jalen Reynolds) to academic issues.\"\nCBS analyst Jeff Borzello noted that \"It will be interesting to see how VCU adjusts in its first year. With that said, the Rams return many of their weapons from last season.\" However, the rams do not have freshmen recruits Mo Alie-Cox and Jordan Burgess, who \"is considered a top 100 recruit,\" as the school announced they were only partial qualifiers by the NCAA and thus were not eligible to compete until at least the 2013–14 season.\nAtlantic 10 preseason poll.\nSource \nAtlantic 10 preseason teams.\nSource \nConference Previews.\nSeveral media outlets projected the final Atlantic 10 Conference standings for the 2012–13 season:\nRegular season.\nA-10 vs. other conferences.\n\"As of 12/3/2012\"\nWeekly honors.\nThroughout the conference regular season, the Atlantic 10 offices name a player of the week and rookie of the week each Monday.\nButler's Roosevelt Jones was named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week on January 21, 2013."

        "text": "Athletes have competed as independent Olympians at the Olympic Games for various reasons, including political transition, international sanctions, suspensions of National Olympic Committees, and compassion. Independent athletes have come from North Macedonia, East Timor, South Sudan and Curaçao following geopolitical changes in the years before the Olympics, from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (present-day Montenegro and Serbia) as a result of international sanctions, from India and Kuwait due to the suspensions of their National Olympic Committees, and from Russia for mass violations of anti-doping rules.\nMedals were won by independent Olympians at the 1992 and 2016 Olympics, both times in shooting. The naming and country code conventions for these independent Olympians have not been consistent. Independent Paralympians have participated at Paralympic Games for the same reasons as independent Olympians.\nPrecursors.\nPrior to the 1906 Intercalated Games, entry was not restricted to teams nominated by National Olympic Committees (NOCs). Mixed-nationality teams competed in some team events. Participants in individual events are retrospectively credited to their nationality of the time.\nThe 1940 Winter Olympics was reassigned to Garmisch-Partenkirchen in spring 1939. In concert with Nazi German claims on Czechoslovakia, the organisers refused to recognise the Czechoslovakia NOC; however they were prepared to allow its athletes to enter under the Olympic flag. In any event, the Games were cancelled because of World War II.\nDuring the Cold War, some athletes who emigrated from Soviet Bloc countries were unable to compete at the Olympics, as their original state's NOC neither wanted them on its own team nor gave them permission to transfer nationality. Some applied to compete as individuals in 1952 and 1956 but were refused.\nWhen Guyana joined the 1976 Olympic boycott, its sprinter James Gilkes asked the IOC to be allowed to compete as an individual, but was refused.\nThe IOC first made provisions for athletes to compete under the Olympic flag in time for the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Some NOCs, mostly from Western Europe, wished to attend the Games despite their governments' support for the American-led boycott in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The NOCs hesitated to use national symbols without government approval, so the IOC relaxed this requirement: 14 NOCs competed under the Olympic flag, while three, New Zealand, Spain and Portugal, competed under their respective NOCs' flag.\n1992 Winter and Summer Olympics.\nIndependent Olympic participants.\nDuring the 1992 Summer Olympics, athletes from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Republic of Macedonia competed as independent Olympic participants. Macedonian athletes could not appear under their own flag because their National Olympic Committee (NOC) had not been formed. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) was under United Nations sanctions which prevented the country from taking part in the Olympics. However, individual Yugoslav athletes were allowed to take part as independent Olympic participants. 58 athletes competed as independent Olympic participants, winning three medals.\nUnified Team.\nThe former Soviet Union (except the Baltic states) competed under the Olympic flag at the 1992 Winter Olympics and 1992 Summer Olympics as a Unified Team.\n2000 Summer Olympics.\nAt the 2000 Summer Olympics, four athletes from East Timor competed as Individual Olympic Athletes during the country's transition to independence.\n2012 Summer Olympics.\nFour athletes competed as independent Olympic Athletes at the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nAfter the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles and subsequent withdrawal of the country's National Olympic Committee, three athletes from the country who qualified for the Games were allowed to compete independently. Several others competed for either Aruba or the Netherlands.\nThe National Olympic Committee for South Sudan was not established between the formation of that state and the 2012 Olympic qualifying. One athlete from South Sudan, Guor Marial, qualified for the Games and was allowed to compete as an independent.\nAthletes from Kuwait were originally allowed to compete as Independent Olympic Athletes as well, because their National Olympic Committee (NOC) was suspended. However, the NOC was reinstated allowing the athletes to compete under their own flag. Kuwait competed under the Olympic flag at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics and 2010 Asian Games.\n2014 Winter Olympics.\nThe Indian Olympic Association was suspended from the IOC in December 2012, due to problems with its electoral process. New elections were scheduled for 9 February 2014, two days after the start of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Therefore, the three Indian athletes who qualified for the Games were scheduled to compete as independent Olympic participants.\nOn 8 and 9 February, Shiva Keshavan participated in the luge competition and received 38th place. He would end up being the only athlete to officially participate as an Independent Olympic Participant.\nOn 11 February 2014, the IOC reinstated the Indian Olympic Association after Narayana Ramachandran, the president of the World Squash Federation, was voted in as the new president of the Indian Olympic Association, allowing the two remaining athletes to compete under the Indian flag rather than as independent athletes. This was the first time such a reinstatement of a NOC occurred as the Olympic Games were underway.\n2016 Summer Olympics.\nKuwaiti athletes competed as independent, as the Kuwait Olympic Committee was suspended by the International Olympic Committee due to governmental interference. This was the second suspension in five years; the first suspension resulted in Kuwaiti athletes being forced to compete under the Olympic flag as \"Athletes from Kuwait\" for the 2010 Asian Games. Fehaid Al-Deehani became the first Independent Olympic Athlete to win a gold medal. Like with gold medalists of the Unified Team at the 1992 Winter and Summer Olympics, the Olympic Hymn was played in the victory ceremony.\nRefugees were allowed to compete under the Olympic Flag at the 2016 Summer Olympics, under the label \"Refugee Olympic Team\". Ten athletes from four countries competed for this team.\nDue to widespread state-controlled doping in Russia, the International Association of Athletics Federations suspended the All-Russia Athletic Federation in November 2015. As a result, no Russian athlete would able to compete internationally, including the 2016 Olympics, until the suspension was lifted. The IAAF announced a path for athletes who train outside the Russia system and could prove themselves to be clean, as well as those who have helped in the fight against doping, to be eligible to compete as neutral athletes at the 2016 Olympics. Two athletes, Darya Klishina and Yuliya Stepanova were initially cleared for competition, as Independent Athletes.\nAlthough Yulia Stepanova was cleared by IAAF because of her revelations regarding Russia's systemic doping program, and IOC's recognition of her \"contribution to the protection and promotion of clean athletes\", she was banned by the IOC in line with the decision to ban all Russian athletes with previous doping convictions. IOC also rejected the suggestion that 'neutral' athletes could compete outside of national selection. Klishina was subsequently confirmed as competing under Russian colours, their only competitor in athletics at the 2016 Olympics.\n2018 Winter Olympics.\nOn 5 December 2017, the IOC announced that Russia would be banned from the 2018 Winter Olympics over its state-sponsored doping program. Russian athletes were allowed to participate under the Olympic flag as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) if they were cleared by a panel, which was chaired by Valerie Fourneyron and had representatives from the IOC, the World Anti-Doping Agency, and the Doping Free Sport Unit of the Global Association of International Sports Federations.\n2020 Summer Olympics.\nThe IOC Refugee Olympic Team competed at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, as independent Olympic participants. Twenty-nine athletes from 12 sports and 18 countries competed for this team. The IOC code was changed to the French acronym \"EOR\" which stands for \"Équipe olympique des réfugiés\".\nFollowing a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms featuring the Russian national colours, the logo of the Russian Olympic Committee and bearing the acronym \"ROC\".\n2022 Winter Olympics.\nFollowing a decision by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym \"ROC\", after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee. On aftermatch, the IOC announced that the Russian national flag would be substituted by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee. It would also be allowed to use team uniforms featuring the Russian national colours, the logo of the Russian Olympic Committee and bearing the acronym \"ROC\"."

        "title": "List of athletes who played in Major League Baseball and the National Football League",
        "text": "Fewer than 70 athletes are known to have played in both Major League Baseball (MLB) and the National Football League (NFL). This includes two Heisman Trophy winners (Vic Janowicz and Bo Jackson) and seven members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame (Red Badgro, Paddy Driscoll, George Halas, Ernie Nevers, Ace Parker, Jim Thorpe, and Deion Sanders). However, none of the players on the list has been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nIn 1920, the inaugural season of the NFL, 11 veterans of MLB (including George Halas and Jim Thorpe) became the first athletes to accomplish the feat. Since 1970, only seven athletes have done so, including Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders. Jackson was the first athlete to be selected as an All-Star in both MLB and the NFL. Sanders holds the longevity record, having appeared in 641 MLB games and 189 NFL games.\nOverview.\nSince the formation of the National Football League (NFL), fewer than 70 athletes are known to have reached the highest level of play in both sports.\nEarly years.\nChristy Mathewson (MLB HOF) played Pro Football from 1898–1902. More than two-thirds of the athletes who played at the top level of both sports did so in the early years of the NFL during the 1920s and 1930s. The 1920 NFL season was the first in the league's history, and 11 veterans of Major League Baseball (MLB) participated in the inaugural campaign. The first group to appear in both sports included Jim Thorpe, a pioneer of professional football who began playing with the Canton Bulldogs in 1915. Thorpe was a Native American who grew up in the Sac and Fox Nation in Oklahoma. He was one of the most versatile athletes of his era, having won Olympic gold medals in 1912 for the pentathlon and decathlon and having also played professional basketball. Thorpe played in MLB from 1913 to 1919 and in the NFL from 1920 to 1928. He was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nThe first group of MLB players to play in the NFL also included George Halas, who remained affiliated with the Chicago Bears as player, coach or owner from the 1920s until his death in 1983, Chuck Dressen, who later managed five Major League Baseball teams, including the Brooklyn Dodgers, from 1934 to 1966. and eight others (Lyle Bigbee, George Brickley, Garland Buckeye, Ralph Capron, Paul Des Jardien, Paddy Driscoll, Al Pierotti, and Tom Whelan).\nBert Kuczynski is one of a very small number of athletes to play Major League Baseball and in the NFL in the same year. In his senior year at Penn Kuczynski was on the NBC/Look Magazine 1942 All-American team as an end. After graduation in May 1943 he pitched in six games for the Philadelphia Athletics and played for the Detroit Lions in the 1943 NFL season. After two years in the Navy, in 1946 he played for the Philadelphia Eagles. While working on his master's degree in education at Penn, he was an assistant coach in the football program.\nIn 1954, former Ohio State star Vic Janowicz became the first Heisman Trophy winner to appear in both MLB and the NFL. After winning the Heisman in 1950, Janowicz played baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1953 to 1954 and football for the Washington Redskins from 1954 to 1955.\nModern players.\nIn 1987, Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson played for both the Los Angeles Raiders and the Kansas City Royals, becoming the first player to play in both the MLB and the NFL since the 1960s. Jackson played eight years in Major League Baseball and four years in the NFL. Jackson was also the first athlete to be named an All-Star in both sports. His versatility led Nike, Inc. to develop its \"Bo Knows\" ad campaign in which Jackson was envisioned attempting to take up a litany of other sports, including tennis, golf, hockey, luge, auto racing, and even playing blues music with Bo Diddley, who scolded Jackson by telling him, \"You don't know diddley!\"\nIn 1989, two years after Jackson's accomplishment, Deion Sanders played baseball for the New York Yankees and football for the Atlanta Falcons. Sanders had greater longevity playing in both sports than any other athlete in history, competing in Major League Baseball from 1989 to 2001 and in the NFL from 1989 to 2005. He led the National League with 14 triples in 1992 and finished second in the league in stolen bases twice: 1994 (38) and 1997 (56). Sanders also played in the 1992 World Series with the Atlanta Braves, hitting .533 in the series with five stolen bases in five attempts. He had a career batting average of .263, with 186 stolen bases and 43 triples in a nine-year career. In the NFL he was selected to play in eight Pro Bowls as a defensive back, and won two Super Bowls with the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys. Sanders had 53 career interceptions, returning 9 for touchdowns, and caught 60 passes for 784 yards and three touchdowns as a wide receiver. He was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.\nBrian Jordan is another notable two-sport athlete who played in both professional leagues. Jordan began his professional career in the NFL, playing three seasons as a safety for the Atlanta Falcons from 1989 to 1991. In his last two seasons in the NFL Jordan started 30 of 32 games and had 5 interceptions and 4 sacks and appeared in the 1991 playoffs with the Falcons. In 1992, Jordan switched to baseball and played 15 years as an outfielder from 1992 to 2006, mostly for the St. Louis Cardinals and Atlanta Braves. He had a career batting average of .282 with 1454 hits and 184 home runs. He was selected as an All-Star in 1999 and played in the World Series that same year. He appeared in post-season a total of five times,\nhitting six home runs in 38 games.\nThe last player to accomplish the feat was Drew Henson, who was a third baseman for the New York Yankees from 2002 to 2003 and a quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys and Detroit Lions in 2004 and 2008.\nIn total, only seven players have accomplished the feat since 1970. They are Jackson, Sanders, Jordan, Henson, Chad Hutchinson, D.J. Dozier, and Matt Kinzer.\nNotable omissions.\nCal Hubbard is the only person to be inducted into both the Baseball Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame. He played in the NFL from 1927 to 1936 and later served as an umpire in Major League Baseball. As he was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame as an umpire, and never appeared as a player, he is not included on the list.\nGreasy Neale is another person who gained fame in both sports but who is omitted from the list. Neale played eight years in Major League Baseball, mostly for the Cincinnati Reds, from 1916 to 1924. He also played for the Dayton Triangles in 1918 before the NFL was established. He later served as the coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1941 to 1950 and has been inducted into both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. However, he never appeared as a player in an official NFL game and is therefore not included in the list.\nList of players.\nThe following athletes have appeared in at least one game in both Major League Baseball and the National Football League."

The top two teams in each group advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams dropped down to the Europa League round of 32.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the group stage was held on 30 August 2012, 17:45 CEST (), at Grimaldi Forum, Monaco.\nTeams were seeded into four pots based on their 2012 UEFA club coefficients. The title holders, Chelsea, were automatically seeded into Pot 1. Pot 1 holds teams ranked 1–12, Pot 2 holds teams ranked 13–31, Pot 3 holds teams ranked 32–60, while Pot 4 holds teams ranked 63–171.\nEach group contained one team from each of the four pots, with the restriction that teams from the same national association cannot be drawn against each other. Moreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups played their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups played their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There were other restrictions, e.g., teams from the same city (e.g. Manchester United and Manchester City) in general did not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tries to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days), and Russian teams did not play at home on the last matchday due to cold weather.\nTiebreakers.\nThe teams are ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings:\nGroups.\nThe matchdays were 18–19 September, 2–3 October, 23–24 October, 6–7 November, 20–21 November, and 4–5 December 2012.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs advanced to the next round. In the event that aggregate score finished level, the away goals rule would be applied, i.e., the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs advanced. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time would be played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule would again be applied after extra time, i.e., if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team would advance by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie would be decided by penalty shootout.\nIn the draws for each round, teams were seeded based on their 2012 UEFA club coefficients, with the teams divided into seeded and unseeded pots. A seeded team was drawn against an unseeded team, with the order of legs in each tie decided randomly. Due to the limited time between matches, the draws for the second and third qualifying rounds took place before the results of the previous round were known. The seeding in these draws (or in any cases where the results of a tie in the previous round were not known at the time of draw) was carried out under the assumption that the higher-ranked teams of the previous round would advance to this round, which means if a lower-ranked team were to advance, it would simply take the seeding of its defeated opponent. Prior to the draws, UEFA may form \"groups\" in accordance with the principles set by the Club Competitions Committee, but they were purely for convenience of the draw and for ensuring that teams from the same association were not drawn against each other, and did not resemble any real groupings in the sense of the competition.\nTeams.\nBelow were the 54 teams (40 in Champions Route, 14 in League Route) involved in the qualifying phase and play-off round, grouped by their starting rounds. The 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route) qualified for the group stage to join the 22 automatic qualifiers.

The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. In the event that aggregate scores finished level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, then thirty minutes of extra time were played, divided into two fifteen-minutes halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by virtue of more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, the tie was played as a single match. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores remained tied.\nThe mechanism of the draws for each round was as follows:\nRound of 16.\nThe first legs were played on 12, 13, 19 and 20 February, and the second legs were played on 5, 6, 12 and 13 March 2013.\nMatches.\n\"Galatasaray won 4–3 on aggregate.\" \n\"Juventus won 5–0 on aggregate.\" \n\"3–3 on aggregate.

        "text": "Willis Elphinstone Davis Jr. (1893–1936) was an American tennis player who was active in the early 20th century.\nCareer.\nDavis was born in San Francisco, the son of wealthy painter Willis E. Davis and his wife Elise \"Elsie\" Kohler Davis. Davis's first prominent tennis match was a doubles competition for the California state championship in 1913 in which he and Lin Murray were eliminated by Clarence Griffin and John Strachan. Davis was playing for the University of California, Berkeley, and won a 1914 match against Stanford University's intercollegiate champion Herbert Hahn. While at Berkeley he joined the secretive fraternity Omicron Delta which had just changed its name from Theta Nu Epsilon, a chapter of the Skull and Bones. He was also a member of Delta Kappa Epsilon.\nBecoming known for his very high speed serve, Davis transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, Towne Scientific School for the 1914–15 school year. \"The New York Times\" profiled him as exemplary of the emerging California style of powerful \"cannonball service\" which Maurice E. McLoughlin had used to become national champion. Davis's explosive serve was observed to have an effective side-breaking spin applied with the top of the racket, a spin which put the opponent off balance. After his serve he usually rushed the net to counter sharply angled return shots. However, Davis was said to have a comparative weakness in his back court game, having put so much effort into perfecting his serve.\nDavis won the mixed doubles title at the 1916 U.S. National Championships played at the Philadelphia Cricket Club. With Eleonora Sears, he defeated Florence Ballin and Bill Tilden in two sets 6–4, 7–5.\nAlso in 1916, Davis won the Clay Court Championship, beating Conrad Doyle in the final in straight sets. In the 1916 Pennsylvania State Championship Davis scored a memorable victory over Bill Tilden in the semifinal, 3–6, 6–3, 13–11, and then claimed the title against Graig Biddle in the final.\nIn 1918, Davis joined the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps as a pilot. He trained in Oakland, California, San Antonio and New York to fly and fight in World War I. As a lieutenant in the American Expeditionary Forces, he was sent to France with fellow players Griffin and Charles S. \"Chuck\" Garland to participate in a friendly tennis match against French and British soldier/players, but the match was rescheduled for earlier and the three missed it. After the war, Davis competed at Wimbledon in 1919.\nA. Wallis Myers of \"The Daily Telegraph\" ranked Davis as World No. 9 in 1919.\nIn 1920, Davis reached the final of the men's doubles championship with Roland Roberts but were defeated by fellow Californians Clarence Griffin and Bill Johnston in three straight sets. He won the singles title at the Pacific Coast Championships (now SAP Open) in 1920 with a victory over Clarence Griffin in the final.\nHis best Grand Slam singles result came at the 1921 U.S. National Championships where he reached the semifinals and lost in straight sets to multiple champion Bill Tilden, though the first went to 10-8.\nHe won the 1921 invitation tennis tournament of the Meadow Club in both singles and doubles. In the singles finals, he defeated Vincent Richards in four sets, and in the doubles finals, he and Watson Washburn defeated brothers Howard and Robert Kinsey. Davis retired from professional competition in 1923."

The Belgian bronze medal team consisted of Léon Flament, François de Coninck, and Georges Anthony; it was the nation's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nNone of the crew members from the 1924 coxed pair event returned. The most accomplished crew was likely the Swiss Schöchlin brothers, who had won the European championship in double sculls in 1922 and had been members of the European champion eight team in 1925.\nNo nations made their debut in the event; the field consisted of all six nations that had competed previously. Belgium and France each made their fourth appearance, the two nations to have competed in all three prior editions.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). In a very unusual situation, the competition featured as many rounds as there were boats: six. There were four main rounds and two repechages. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael\nRound 1.\nWinners advanced to the second round.

Losers competed in the second repechage, if they had advanced by winning in the first round, or were eliminated if they had advanced through the first repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nItaly had not finished the second round, so Belgium was the only team to qualify for the second repechage, receiving a bye to the semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nSwitzerland advanced uncontested to the gold medal final, and was joined by France after France won the only semifinal against Belgium. Belgium received the bronze."

Switzerland was once again among the favourites, with a strong chance for a third straight gold. Italy had won the 1925, 1926, and 1927 European championships (with Switzerland third, second, and second those years), however, and was a significant challenger.\nJapan and Monaco each made their debut in the event.

It was held from 2 to 10 August 1928. There were 11 boats (99 competitors) from 11 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the United States, the third consecutive victory for the Americans in the event and fifth overall (winning every time the team competed). Great Britain returned to the podium after a one-Games absence in 1924 broke a three-Games medal streak, taking silver this time.

The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nGreat Britain and the United States were the dominant nations in the event, with the nations winning all six prior Olympic men's eight competitions between them. The United States held a 4–2 edge and the reigning crown (two times in a row). They were represented this time by the University of California, Berkeley (the United States) and the Thames Rowing Club (Great Britain). The Thames club had won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1927 and 1928.\nDenmark and Poland each made their debut in the event.

The event was won by Vincent Richards of the United States, the nation's first victory in the event since 1904 and second overall (tied with South Africa for second-most all-time behind Great Britain's three wins). France and Italy each earned their first men's singles tennis medals, with Henri Cochet's silver and Uberto De Morpurgo's bronze, respectively.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe field for this event was stronger than previous Olympic tournaments, but still had significant absences. The American greats Bill Tilden and Bill Johnston (\"Big Bill\" and \"Little Bill\") did not compete, but Vincent Richards was ranked world #2 in 1924 and the rest of the United States team (R. Norris Williams, Watson Washburn, and Francis Hunter) were all significant players. Three of France's Four Musketeers, who would rise to prominence later in the 1920s, competed. Defending champion Louis Raymond of South Africa returned.\nArgentina, Chile, Finland, India, Ireland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Portugal, Romania, and Yugoslavia each made their debut in the event. France made its sixth appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match.

Unlike the Ireland women's national rugby union team, the sevens team is a professional team with players contracted to the Irish Rugby Football Union.\nWorld Rugby Women's Sevens Series.\nIreland first competed in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series as an invited team in 2012–13. They entered the 2013 China Women's Sevens and won the Plate competition. After finishing as quarter-finalists in the 2013 Rugby World Cup Sevens, Ireland qualified to be a core team for 2013–14. Ireland did not participate in 2014–15 but returned as a core team in 2015–16 after finishing as runners up to Japan in a qualifying tournament hosted at UCD Bowl in August 2015. Ireland remained as a core team for 2016–17 and 2017–18. Ireland have never won a Cup at any of the Series tournaments but they have won Challenge Trophies, Plates and Bowls. Ireland's best performance in the Series came in 2016–17 when they finished ninth overall and gained their first ever wins against Fiji, England and France. In April 2017 Sene Naoupu scored three tries as Ireland won the Challenge Trophy at the 2017 Japan Women's Sevens, defeating Spain 26–7 in the final. In 2016 and 2017 they also won two successive Challenge Trophies at the Dubai Women's Sevens.\nTournaments.\nRugby World Cup Sevens.\nIreland made their Rugby World Cup Sevens debut at the 2013 tournament. They qualified after finishing sixth in the 2012 Sevens Women Grand Prix Series. The team was captained by Claire Molloy and they reached the quarter-finals, finishing seventh overall.\nThe Ireland women's sevens team and the Ireland women's national rugby union team has often used the same set of players. For example, the 2018 Women's Six Nations Championship squad included nine rugby sevens internationals. This has occasionally led to conflicts of interest. In February 2017 Sene Naoupu, Alison Miller and Hannah Tyrrell were controversially withdrawn from Ireland's 2017 Women's Six Nations Championship squad in order to represent the Ireland Sevens in the 2017 USA Women's Sevens. The reasoning behind this decision was that the Ireland Sevens were chasing a top eight finish in the 2016–17 World Rugby Women's Sevens Series in order to qualify for the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens. Ireland eventually finished ninth in the Series but subsequently qualified for the World Cup after finishing third in the 2017 Rugby Europe Women's Sevens Grand Prix Series.\nRugby Europe Women's Sevens.\nIreland first competed in the Rugby Europe Women's Sevens in 2006. Their best performances in the tournament were in 2016 and 2017 when they finished third on both occasions.\nOlympics.\nIn their attempt to qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics, Ireland competed in a series of qualifying tournaments including the 2015 Rugby Europe Women's Sevens Championships, the 2015 Rugby Europe Women's Sevens Olympic Repechage Tournament and the 2016 Rugby World Women's Sevens Olympic Repechage Tournament.

Between 1912 and 1970, over 5,000 children have attended the school. The school remained closed for the following decades.\nAfter renovating the building, St. Eugene Golf Course opened in 2000, followed by Casino of the Rockies in 2002, and the St. Eugene Hotel in 2003.\nThe resort underwent a multi-million renovation that was completed in July 2019.\nGround penetrating radar located 182 suspected unmarked graves in the community's cemetery which is adjacent to the former St. Eugene Residential School. In a June 30, 2021 press release, the Leadership of ʔaq̓am, a First Nations community part of the Ktunaxa Nation, indicated that unmarked graves can occur due to deterioration of wooden crosses that had traditionally been used to mark graves; the Leadership also indicated that: \"it is extremely difficult to establish whether or not these unmarked graves contain the remains of children who attended the St. Eugene Residential School.\" In a media release from the Lower Kootenay Band, also a member of the Ktunaxa Nation, Chief Jason Louis stated that \"It is believed that the remains of these 182 souls are from the member bands of the Ktunaxa Nation, neighbouring First Nations communities and the community of ʔaq̓am.\"\nProperty.\nThe resort has a golf course, a casino, two restaurants, a bar, and a spa.\nThe 3-story St. Eugene Hotel has 125 rooms and suites.

        "title": "Concussions in American football",
        "text": "Concussions and play-related head blows in American football have been shown to be the cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has led to player deaths and other debilitating symptoms after retirement, including memory loss, depression, anxiety, headaches, stress, and sleep disturbances.\nThe list of ex-NFL players that have either been diagnosed \"post-mortem\" with CTE or have reported symptoms of CTE continues to grow.\nAccording to Boston University, CTE is a brain degenerative disease found in athletes, military veterans, and others with history of repetitive brain trauma. Although CTE is highly controversial and misunderstood, it is believed that a protein called Tau forms clumps that slowly spread throughout the brain, killing brain cells.\nThere is also theoretical research that suggests early CTE might result from damaged blood vessels within the brain. That could trigger brain inflammation and, eventually, the development of proteins such as Tau believed to play a key role in CTE. This hypothesis was tested on adult mice; the researchers state that their brains possess similar attributes to that of human brains. Using a special device, the mice were given precise impacts that would lead to mild brain traumas similar to what an athlete would suffer in contact sports. The mice, whose brains were scanned using a specialized MRI, immediately showed changes to the electrical functions of their brains.\nAccording to 2017 study on brains of deceased gridiron football players, 99% of tested brains of NFL players, 88% of CFL players, 64% of semi-professional players, 91% of college football players, and 21% of high school football players had various stages of CTE.\nOther common injuries include, injuries of legs, arms, neck and lower back.\nNFL concussions.\nEfforts are being made within the NFL to address concussions and promote player safety. The league has made progress in recent years in reducing concussive injuries. The NFL is committed to addressing these issues and making improvements wherever possible by actively working to reduce the risk of head injuries and make the game safer for players. \nThere has been a persisting concern regarding concussions in the NFL, particularly as former players come forward with experiences related to these injuries. Research has indicated that repeated head trauma can have a significant impact on behavior and cognitive function. \nThe number of reported concussions in the National Football League (NFL) has increased by 18% since 2022. Some experts believe this trend should be reversed, citing technological advancements and helmet studies. It has been suggested that the NFL modify its helmets to reduce concussions. \nIf a player displays or reports symptoms of a concussion or stinger (a nerve pinch injury) after a blow to the head, they must follow NFL protocol. Various individuals, including the team athletic trainer, booth ATC spotter, team physician, game official, coach, teammate, sideline Unaffiliated Neurotrauma Consultant (UNC), or booth UNC, can initiate the protocol.\nHistory.\nConcussions are frequent injuries among football players. Concussions occur when the head is subject to a large impact force, resulting in a minor brain injury. There has been a growing concern about concussions since the early 1900s. In 1906, a Harvard student-athlete died from a head injury and the team doctors released a report titled \"The Physical Aspect of American Football\" in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal describing the type, severity, and number of injuries the team sustained in the 1905 season.\nThe NFL first began to review the subject formally in 1994, then NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue approved the creation of the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee with the stated goal of studying the effects of concussions and sub-concussive injury in NFL players. Tagliabue appointed rheumatologist Elliot Pellman to chair the committee. Pellman's appointment was met with harsh criticism, because he is not a neurologist or neuropsychologist and often admitted ignorance about head injuries. The concussion data collected by the league from 1996 to 2001 has been shown to understate the actual number of diagnosed concussions by ten percent. The league additionally relied on legal counsel who were actively involved in downplaying health risks in the tobacco industry.\nThe same year, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) reported a statistically significant increase in the risk of neurological disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in retired football players, which furthered public knowledge about the risk of long-term neurocognitive disease related to repeated head impacts. Despite the NIOSH study, Pellman and the MTBI Committee drew their own conclusions that continued to contradict these findings and those of other organizations. Biomechanical engineers and neurosurgeons informed the Committee that the helmet safety standard at that time was insufficient to minimize the risk of concussions.\nThe MTBI Committee began studying the nature of tackle plays resulting in concussive impacts and developing its own biomechanical analysis of the effect of these forces on the brain. It started publishing study results in 2003 that stated there were no long-term negative health consequences associated with concussions sustained by NFL players. A six-year study by the Committee concluded that, \"Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.\"\nResearch.\nOther organizations continued to publish study results that linked repeated concussions and long-term health problems contrary to reports by the MTBI Committee. A 2003 report by the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes at the University of North Carolina, for example, found a connection between numerous concussions and depression among former professional football players. Further, the center's follow-up study in 2005 associated both brain impairment and Alzheimer's disease with retired NFL players who had histories of concussions.\nA 2004 doctoral dissertation by Don Brady examined NFL Players' knowledge of concussions, studying both active and retired National Football League Players' knowledge of concussions. Brady's findings concluded: that many NFL players lacked accurate and essential knowledge pertaining to various aspects of a concussion; that the preponderance of credible experimental and clinical evidence pertaining to the adverse effects of concussion indicates that the brain is injured as a result of a concussion; that the altered cell functioning and cell death along with subtle to more visible neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and other medical problems reflect a diverse range of lifelong negative consequences of a concussion / brain injury; and that sports team health-care personnel need to focus primarily on the athletes' health and well-being, and not minimize an injury or primarily concentrate on the players' capacity to perform on the field. This expanded focus of health care is necessary in order to avoid any real or perceived conflicts of interest emerging in the concussion research, concussion management and related return to play decision-making process.\nDuring November 2014, Brady filed objections to the proposed NFL concussion settlement offer. Brady sent a cover letter and detailed objections on behalf of NFL retired players to the presiding US district court judge, Anita Brody.\nIn addition to the studies that continued to contradict the work of the MTBI Committee, renowned experts and sports journalists wrote critical reviews of the committee's studies. Robert Cantu of the American College of Sports Medicine noted bias in the committee's extremely small sample size and held that no conclusions should be drawn from the NFL's studies. In an ESPN Magazine article titled \"Doctor Yes,\" Peter Keating criticized Pellman and the MTBI Committee's work and argued that the \"... Committee has drawn a number of important conclusions about head trauma and how to treat it that contradict the research and experiences of many other doctors who treat sports concussions, not to mention the players who have suffered them.\"\nMore studies continued to associate repetitive head injuries with neurological problems later in life. Kevin Guskiewicz, Director of the Center for the Study of Retired Athletes in the Department of Exercise and Sport Science at the University of North Carolina, analyzed data from a 2007 study of nearly 2,500 former NFL players. He found about 11 percent of the study participants suffered from clinical depression, with a threefold increased risk in former players who had a history of three or four concussions. The following year, the NFL commissioned the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research to conduct a study involving more than 1,000 former NFL players. The results reported that Alzheimer's disease or similar diseases appear to have been diagnosed in former NFL players vastly more often than in the general population at a rate of 19 times the normal rate for men ages 30 through 49. The NFL responded to these results by claiming the study was incomplete.\nOn September 30, 2014, researchers with Boston University announced that in autopsies of 79 brains of former NFL players, 76 had tested positive for CTE. As of January 2017, that number had grown to 90 out of 94. A study published in \"The Journal of the American Medical Association\" in July 2017 showed that 110 of 111 former NFL players whose brains were examined were found to have suffered from CTE. \nEffects of concussions.\nConcussions are a large issue in the NFL. Many findings suggest that the onset of dementia-related symptoms are initiated by repetitive cerebral concussions in professional football players. \nCTE and other issues have been a very serious issue being caused by severe brain damage in football. ESPN states that \"The brain of former Kansas City Chiefs linebacker Jovan Belcher -- the 25-year-old player who shot and killed his girlfriend in 2012 before committing suicide -- showed signs of pervasive brain damage like that found in other deceased NFL players, according to a neuropathologist.\" \nHelmets.\nIn the article, Sports Law and Governance, it talks about how over 2,000 former NFL players are dealing with concussions later on in life. The players are complaining and the league is getting sued for how the helmets have led players to have severe lifelong brain damage. The NFL has been responding with a new \"HIT\" system helping players not get these problems so easily. \nWildman, a sports scientist shows how much of an ongoing criticism is about NFL helmets and just helmets in general. The NFL finally acknowledged the negative impact concussions have on its billion-dollar business and opted to start awarding research grants geared toward finding a solution. They are constantly trying to make better ways to protect the players without restraining them. \nThe Journal of Sociocultural Examinations of Sports Concussion shows significant data on concussions and . No matter what it is they are always trying to figure out a new helmet or new material to use to make it a lot safer for players if they take a lot of big blows to the head area. The article stated, \"suicides of former players linked to head trauma have combined to increase the public's awareness about the potential dangers of concussions in all levels of football.\"  \nPrevention.\nIn October 2009, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell and the NFL Concussion Committee were called before Congress to defend their policies against allegations of neglect. Goodell provided testimony, but was unable to answer many questions. As a result of this incident and pressure from the NFL Players Association, the NFL released a comprehensive overhaul of the league concussion policy in November and December 2009. The policy expanded the list of symptoms that would prevent a player from returning to a game or practice on the same day their injury occurred.\nWith continued pressure to protect players, the NFL began preventing players knocked unconscious by a concussion from returning to a game or practice, a policy that applied to Detroit Lions running back Jahvid Best in . Various players have filed lawsuits against the league for the concussions, accusing the league of hiding information that linked head trauma to permanent brain damage, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia. Some teams chose not to draft certain players in the NFL Draft due to their past concussion history. According to an Outside the Lines report, the head impact telemetry system (HITS) was in question by the League, although Kevin Guskiewicz, a professor at the University of North Carolina, said the system is functional. The technology could detect and measure the impact of blows to the head in real time during a game, but no such measurement exists in the league at this time. Former Pittsburgh Steelers receiver and current NBC Sports analyst Hines Ward stated the use of the system would be \"opening a Pandora's Box\", and that the data recorded by the system could be used by team owners to give players lower salaries.\nIn November 2011, the Cleveland Clinic Center for Spine Health created an online study released by the \"Journal of Neurosurgery\" in which various football helmets were compared with each other via crash test dummies. It was also found that leather helmets provided similar results to modern helmets, and in some cases, the leather helmets proved to have superior protection against concussive blows. However, the leather helmets did not provide as much protection against skull fractures.\nConcussion protocol process.\nWhen a football player sustains a concussion in the NFL, he is required to go through the concussion protocol the league has in place by the NFL Head, Neck and Spine Committee:\nPreseason evaluation.\nBefore the NFL season starts, all players and coaching staff of an organization are required to be educated on concussions and the importance of promptly reporting any concussion symptoms. All players in the league are also mandated to take a baseline neurological and physical exam. The baseline neurological exam is either a computerized or paper and pencil exam that will test different brain functions. The exam tests attention span, memory, language, speech skills, reasoning, planning, and organizational skills. The results of this test are used as a baseline if a player suffers a head injury at any point throughout the season. The preseason physical examination allows the team physician and athletic trainer the opportunity to review and answer any questions the player might have. This also gives the physician and athletic trainer the time to go over any previous concussions, discuss the importance of reporting any symptoms of a concussion, and explain the concussion protocol that is in place for the current season.\nIn-game identification.\nCurrent NFL concussion protocol creates positions in each organization's medical staff who are specifically charged with identifying and diagnosing concussions. One of these roles involves an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant who work with other team physicians and athletic trainers to conduct evaluations. Another position involves athletic trainers who are positioned in the booth at every game to spot potential concussions in players from both teams. These spotters review film throughout the game that could possibly result in concussions and are capable to call \"medical timeouts\" to relay that information to the medical personnel on the sidelines so that further evaluation can be conducted. These spotters have been in use since the 2011 season.\nIn-game evaluation.\nIf a player shows to have a concussion or concussion symptoms, it is mandatory that the individual be removed from the game. If the player is diagnosed with a concussion, they are prohibited from re-entering the game or practice that day. According to the league's protocol, signs of a concussion include: loss of consciousness, lack of balance, holding head after contact, absentmindedness, lethargy, confusion or a visible facial injury in combination with any of the other factors. If the medical staff rule the player clear from a concussion, then the video of that hit must be reviewed before the player can re-enter the game or practice.\nPost-game.\nAfter a concussion has occurred, the player must be monitored and examined on a daily basis in a training room by the team medical staff until fully cleared from concussion. Along with the continuous examination prior to a concussion, the player must meet standards that are in place by the league in order to return a game or contact practice. The player may not return to football activities until he has returned to his baseline cognitive function. Next, the player must go through a graduated exercise challenge, followed by a gradual return to practice and play. If player is feeling any setback or post- concussion symptoms, evaluation then starts from the beginning. Finally, the team doctor and an unaffiliated neurotrauma consultant must both clear him for return to play.\nNFL litigation.\nDenial by the League.\nThe NFL spent years trying to deny and cover up any link that emerged connecting head injuries sustained while playing football with long-term brain disorders. The NFL Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (MTBI) Committee, first formed in 1994, reported in December 1999 that the number of head injuries had remained \"remarkably the same over the course of four years.\" The committee went a step further in 2004 when it suggested in an article published in \"Neurosurgery\" that \"NFL players have evolved to a state where their brains are less susceptible to injury.\" Two months after that, MTBI publishes another article that concludes \"Players who are concussed and return to the same game have fewer initial signs and symptoms than those removed from play. Return to play does not involve a significant risk of a second injury either in the same game or during the season.\" However, when Dr. Bennet Omalu examined the brain of former Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster, he discovered a new brain disease, which he called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE. He outlined his findings in a scientific paper published in \"Neurosurgery\" in July 2005. The NFL's MTBI committee wrote in May 2006 that the article be retracted. Dr. Omalu instead wrote a second paper in the same magazine, this time about former Pittsburgh Steeler Terry Long. Dr. Ira Casson, who was then co-chair of MTBI, denied in a televised interview that there was any link between head injuries sustained playing in the NFL and long-term brain damage. His repeated denials won him the nickname \"Dr. No.\" In September 2009, \"The New York Times\" published an article of an NFL-funded study stating that former players are 19 times more likely than the general population to have dementia, Alzheimer's or other memory-related diseases. The NFL's spokesperson, Greg Aiello, publicly said, \"the study did not formally diagnose dementia, that it was subject to shortcomings of telephone surveys.\" Two months later, Aiello told \"New York Times\" reporter Alan Schwarz that \"it's quite obvious from the medical research that's been done that concussions can lead to long-term problems.\" It was the first time any League official had acknowledged a link between the two.\nThings got worse for the NFL when investigative reporters Steve Fainaru and his brother Mark Fainaru-Wada learned from an anonymous source that the NFL Retirement Board had awarded \"disability payments to at least three former players after concluding that football caused their crippling brain injuries – even as the league's top medical experts for years consistently denied any link between the sport and long-term brain damage.\" One of the cases was that of Mike Webster, who filed a claim in 1999. In 2005, three years after his death, his family received $1.8 million from the Retirement Board. \"That same year\", write the Fainuru brothers, \"the NFL published the 10th installment in its series on concussions research in the medical journal \"Neurosurgery.\" The paper, whose authors included three members of the League's [MTBI], asserted that chronic brain injury 'has never been reported in American football players.\nSince Aiello's admittance, the link between head injuries in football and long-term brain damage have become more accepted in the NFL. In a roundtable discussion with the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce, Jeff Miller, the NFL's senior vice-president for health and safety, admitted that \"there is a link between football-related head trauma and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.\" However, public relations issues continue to plague the League. A report from the Democratic members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce said that \"the NFL rescinded a gift to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for concussion research when it learned the study's findings would be detrimental to the league's image.\" The NFL had tried to funnel the funds it gave to the NIH towards its own studies. The League rejected the accusations.\nTo mitigate the public relations (PR) nightmare, the NFL has taken several steps to better assure player safety and bring awareness to head injuries in football players of all ages. Several rule changes took place between 2007 and 2014. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell issued a memo in December 2009 to all 32 teams stating that a player who sustains a concussion cannot return to play if he shows signs or symptoms, such as inability to remember assignments or plays, a gap in memory and persistent dizziness. This move changed the 2007 rule saying a player cannot return only if he has lost consciousness. Additionally, new rules regarding \"crown of the helmet\" tackles have been installed where a runner or a tackler cannot initiate forcible contact with the crown of the helmet outside the tackle box so as to protect players' heads. Lastly, the NFL and USA Football launched the Heads Up Football initiative, which \"emphasizes a smarter and safer way to play and teach youth football, including proper tackling and taking the head out of the game.\" A mobile application was also launched with help from the CDC where information about concussion protocols and player health and safety can be easily reached by parents and coaches.\nThe PR issues surrounding the NFL's cover-up of concussions are far from over, and it is too early to tell how and to what extent these events will impact the NFL or football playing. Robert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University and former college football player says, \"In the short-run, [the NFL] is still thriving\", but downward trends in youth football players shows that future generations \"might have less of an intimate attachment to the sport.\" Boland says this in light of Pop Warner football enrollment dropping by 9.5 percent between 2010 and 2012, likely linked to the high-profile concussion problem.\nFederal NFL concussion litigation.\nIn April 2011, attorneys Sol H. Weiss and Larry E. Coben from the Philadelphia law firm of Anapol Weiss filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Ray Easterling, Jim McMahon and five other players. Thousands of former NFL players have since filed lawsuits against the League after suffering repeated concussions throughout their careers.\nThe multidistrict litigation (MDL) titled In re: National Football League Players' Concussion Injury Litigation (MDL 2323) was filed on January 31, 2012, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Judge Anita B. Brody presides over the matter. The master administrative long-form complaint, filed by Plaintiff's Co-Lead Counsel Sol Weiss and Christopher Seeger on June 7, 2012, alleges the League \"... was aware of the evidence and the risks associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries virtually at the inception, but deliberately ignored and actively concealed the information from the Plaintiffs and all others who participated in organized football at all levels.\" The master complaint argues the NFL knew or should have known players who sustain repetitive head injuries are at risk of suffering \"... early-onset of Alzheimer's Disease, dementia, depression, deficits in cognitive functioning, reduced processing speed, attention, and reasoning, loss of memory, sleeplessness, moods swings, personality changes, and the debilitating and latent disease known as Chronic traumatic encephalopathy ('CTE').\"\nIn April 2012, Easterling was found dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound in his home. An autopsy report concluded Easterling's brain had evidence of CTE, a degenerative brain disease associated with frequent blows to the head.\nOne month later, former San Diego Chargers player Junior Seau also died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, and a brain autopsy showed he suffered from CTE.\nLike Easterling and Seau, an autopsy of Bears safety Dave Duerson's brain after he committed suicide earlier that year revealed he also suffered from the same degenerative brain disease.\nThe autopsy results following these players' suicides heightened existing concerns regarding the connection between player deaths and concussions. Neuropathologist Bennet Omalu has identified CTE in the autopsies of former players Mike Webster, Terry Long, Justin Strzelczyk, Andre Waters, and Chris Henry. One of the difficult issues facing doctors is attempting to identify mental health effects from concussions during the lives of former players rather than after their deaths. In April 2012, a group of former Dallas Cowboys—including Pro Football Hall of Fame inductees Randy White, Bob Lilly, and Rayfield Wright (among other retired players from around the league)—filed a lawsuit against the NFL, again accusing it of ignoring a link between concussions and brain injury.\nIn August 2012, the number of players involved in suits against the NFL increased to 3,402, and the League sued three dozen insurance companies in an attempt to force them to cover the costs of defending claims of not protecting players. However, Travelers ultimately sued the League on August 21 in a lawsuit called Discover Property &amp; Casualty Co. et al. vs. National Football League et al., New York State Supreme Court, New York County, No. 652933/2012. The company provided liability coverage for the League's merchandising arm (NFL Properties), and the insurer also pointed out that the above-mentioned lawsuit has allegedly 14 counts against the League, while only two against NFL Properties.\nAfter quarterbacks Jay Cutler, Michael Vick and Alex Smith sustained concussions in Week 10 of the 2012 season, the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA) reiterated their plans to have independent neurologists on the sidelines at every game. The 2013–14 NFL season involved an independent neurological consultant per team on the sideline of every game. Concussion guidelines released by the NFL in 2013, mandated a four-stage protocol for concussions, including examinations, treatment and monitoring prior to a return to play. In March 2013, the League proposed a rule to reduce concussions by making it illegal for a ball carrier or tackler to \"initiate forcible contact by delivering a blow with the top crown of his helmet against an opponent when both players are clearly outside of the tackle box.\" However, the proposal was met with criticism from players like running backs Matt Forte, Emmitt Smith and Marshall Faulk.\nA federal hearing was held on April 9, 2013, in Philadelphia to discuss the League's motion to dismiss the lawsuits brought on behalf of more than 4,500 former players. On July 8, 2013, Judge Brody ordered representatives of both sides of the litigation to explore a possible settlement in the litigation. Judge Brody ordered a report on or before September 3, 2013, regarding the results of the mediation.\nA proposed settlement was reached in the litigation on August 29, 2013. Under the agreement, the NFL will contribute $765 million to provide medical help to more than 18,000 former players. Retired players who suffer severe neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) diseases in the future will also be eligible to apply for medical help. In addition, $10 million will fund brain injury research as well as safety and education programs.\nThe settlement says it should not be interpreted as a statement of legal liability on the part of the NFL.\nThe settlement, which is projected to protect retired players for nearly 65 years, will compensate injured former players who need immediate help and will provide baseline assessments and medical benefits to those who are symptom-free or beginning to show signs of neurological problems.\n\"I think it's more important that the players have finality, that they're vindicated, and that as soon as the court approves the settlement they can begin to get screening, and those that are injured can get their compensation. I think that's more important than looking at some documents\", attorney Weiss said.\nThe settlement also allows a player diagnosed with CTE the eligibility to up to 4 million dollars in compensation. This has been met with criticism of the settlement's structure as it only applies to players diagnosed before the settlements preliminary agreement and disallows those diagnosed after the approval of the deal in July.\nControversy continues to surround the NFL response to concussive injuries among current and former players. Although Mike Webster was the first patient to be diagnosed with CTE, posthumously, being the first diagnosed case and one of the higher profile cases illuminating the issue of head trauma injuries to the NFL, his family has not received financial compensation from the NFL. The reason for this is Webster's died before January 1, 2006, and in the terms of the NFL's settlement agreement, the organization is only responsible for dispersing compensation payments to families of players who died from head related trauma and injuries from 2006 and beyond. The Webster family is currently taking legal action against the National Football League with the goal of removing that qualification from the settlement.\nThe NFL has paid nearly $1 billion in settlements from claims alleging long-term injuries from repeated blows to the head. Courts have examined these claims using a \"Trigger\" process. This trigger process includes 4 triggers: The \"exposure\" trigger, the \"manifestation\" trigger, the \"injury-in-fact\" trigger, and the \"continuous\" trigger.\nThe dementia tests that the NFL-approved process used came under scrutiny in 2021, as black players were assumed to have a lower baseline cognitive function than non-black players, making it more difficult to prove dementia in their case. The practice was called \"race-norming\" by opponents. A lawsuit attempting to overturn the practice was thrown out in March 2021 and the judge ordered the parties to resolve it via mediation. In June 2021, the NFL announced it would end the practice and would form a panel of neuropsychologists to create new, race-neutral standards.\nKansas City Chiefs concussion lawsuit.\nOn December 3, 2013, five former NFL players filed a lawsuit against the Kansas City Chiefs organization: former Chiefs players Alexander Cooper, Leonard Griffin, Christopher Martin, Joe Phillips, and Kevin Porter. They wish to know what the Chiefs knew about concussions and when they knew it.\nThis lawsuit is unique and different from the thousands of lawsuits previously filed against the NFL. These players are not suing the NFL, and are instead suing the Chiefs.\nFrom 1987 to 1993 there was no Collective Bargaining Agreement established in the NFL. With no existence of a CBA in these years, players who played during this time for the Chiefs can sue the team for many of the same reasons the NFL has been sued. The $765 million settlement in August 2013 between the NFL and former players only protected the NFL. \"I think all of our clients were disappointed\", McClain said of his clients reaction to the settlement with the NFL. The players gordon suing the Chiefs have all opted-out of the settlement from the previous mediation with the NFL.\nA law unique to Missouri allows certain former NFL players to sue the individual team. The current Missouri law states that employees can sue employers in civil court if the employees declined worker's compensation. The Independence attorney for the five ex-Chiefs, Ken McClain said, \"The lawsuit is allowed in Missouri after a state workers' compensation statute was amended in 2005 to exclude cases of occupational injury that occur over an extended time.\"\nThe amendment of the 2005 law is set to be changed at the end of December 2013. Martin and McClain have both encouraged former players who are eligible to join the lawsuit before their window of opportunity expires.\nOn December 1, 2012, Jovan Belcher, a then-current member of the Kansas City Chiefs, shot and killed his fiancée, Kassandra Perkins, before committing suicide in the Arrowhead practice facility parking lot. On behalf of Belcher's and Perkins' daughter, lawyers have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the Chiefs. Belcher's mother has filed a similar suit accusing the Chiefs of ignoring Belcher's cries for help as he complained of concussion like symptoms. The first occurrence came against Jacksonville in 2009 where Belcher was knocked unconscious and failed to receive adequate treatment. The second occurrence was against the Bengals in November 2012. The lawsuits allege, Belcher \"suffered what should have been recognized as an acute concussion.\" However, one lawsuit continues, \"despite exhibiting obvious symptoms, Decedent was never removed from play for evaluation and recovery.\" The lawsuits also claims Belcher exhibited signs of CTE, including changes in his mood and behavior.\nOn September 30, 2014, it was announced that the brain of former Kansas City Chiefs player, Jovan Belcher, contained neurofibrillary tangles of tau protein; which is associated with CTE. The tangles were distributed throughout Belcher's hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with memory, learning and emotion. If the findings of CTE come to be true, Belcher's daughter and mother are eligible for up to $4 million under the National Football League's current Collective Bargaining Agreement.\nRiddell concussion litigation.\nOn March 11, 2016, the family of deceased San Diego Charger defensive back Paul Oliver sued helmet-maker Riddell along with its related corporate entities, in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Chicago, Illinois. Shortly thereafter, Pro Football Hall of Fame running back and Super Bowl champion Paul Hornung, represented by The Brad Sohn Law Firm and Corboy &amp; Demetrio, filed a related case against these defendants. Now, some 100 former professional players have sued Riddell in the consolidated litigation in Cook County, which alleges Riddell to have conspired with the NFL in creating false science. Riddell's attempt at the same federal labor preemption defense attempted by the NFL failed. The NFL remains subject to discovery in this case, even though it is a non-party.\nConcussions in college football.\nThe NCAA, like the NFL, has been criticized for its handling of concussions, with numerous players having retired from football due to concussions, or have filed lawsuits against the association for failing to protect student-athletes from concussions. In 2011, former players Derek Owens and Alex Rucks filed lawsuits against the association for failing to cover the players' safety. Both Owens and Rucks claimed that they had suffered brain trauma which could have been prevented. In 2012, the Southeastern Conference and Big Ten Conference began work on preventing concussions, and appointed University of Mississippi Chancellor Dan Jones to evaluate and review existing research and various diagnoses from past analyses. In 2009, an NCAA panel created and recommended a rule that prevents athletes from returning to a game after sustaining a concussion. The panel also had recommended for an athlete to be sidelined after any concussion-related injury until the athlete was cleared by a doctor. Under the new plan, all student-athletes must sign statements saying that they will report all signs and symptoms of concussions to their coaches. In addition, all athletes must have baseline cognitive testing while the post-injury cognitive testing is strongly recommended. The athletes diagnosed with concussions must be removed from sports for a minimum of one day and can only return when decided by a team physician.\nConcussions in other leagues.\nNCAA Football.\nIn the 2003 football season, there were a reported 184 concussions out of the 4251 athletes that participated in that specific football season. That is 6.3% of college football players have reported having a concussion. This number does not include the athletes that fail to report they had a concussion. Out of these athletes that reported their concussion and sat out of competition until released to participate again, 6.5% of these athletes had another concussion occur in the same season. Concussions are known to be one of the most common injuries in College Football, this is because of the constant contact to these athletes' head. Another reason these concussions are very likely to happen is because, once a concussion is sustained, it is very likely to happen again. In fact an athlete that has sustained a concussion has a 35.1% chance of this injury reoccurring. The teams athletic trainers have specific guidelines for when their athletes sustain a concussion, and they must follow these guidelines when diagnosing a concussion, and also releasing a player to play after the initial diagnosis of the concussion. Failure to follow the specific concussion protocol will result in harsh punishment against the university. The athletic trainers do not have a specific guideline to how long it takes for their athletes to recover from these concussions, when they feel their athlete is ready to undergo protocol to return to play, is when they will test if their athlete is healthy enough to participate.\nPlayers that have suffered from the concussion, the average of their age was 19.5 years of age, and they had an estimated 8.4 years of experience. Players that have suffered two or more concussions were slightly younger at 19.1 years of age, and had some more experience at 9.1 years of participation. This supports the statement that athletes with more exposure to these helmet to helmet hits will be more prone to concussions. For example, a quarterback that is hit the least amount on the football fields only suffers concussions around 5.6% of the reported concussions, opposed to offensive linemen that suffer about 20.9% of the reported concussions. \nCanadian Football League.\nIn the 2010 season for the Canadian Football League, there have been 50 reported concussions; 44.8 percent of players reported having a concussion or concussion-like symptoms, 16.9 percent had confirmed that they had a concussion, and 69.6 percent of all players who suffered from concussions that year suffered from more than one. However, the average of 0.59 concussions per game is lower than the 0.67 recorded by the NFL in 2010. The league eventually started a concussion-awareness program with the help of Football Canada, Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS), the Canadian School Sport Federation, the Canadian Football League Players Association (CFLPA), the Canadian Football League Alumni Association (CFLAA), and the ThinkFirst program. The league eventually pointed out eight protocols:\nIn 2012, ThinkFirst founder and Toronto Western Hospital neurosurgeon Charles Tator led a study that was conducted by the University of Toronto, which examined the brains of 20 former players with a history of concussions, and compared them to 20 other players without a history of head injury. A separate group of 20 without football experience served as a control group. Also in 2012, the league and Tator announced a partnership to work in a study that would perform postmortem tests on former CFL players to look for signs of CTE.\nArena Football League.\nIn the Arena Football League, despite the league's intense play, very few lawsuits have been filed for concussions. The most notable lawsuit against the league was a lawsuit filed by former Colorado Crush kicker Clay Rush in 2010, who claimed that he suffered from permanent brain damage due to repeated blows to the head during games. Like the NFL, the AFL prohibits players who suffered from concussions from practicing. In 2008, during the original league's final season, the \"Shockometer\" made its debut at two season-opening games (Dallas Desperados vs. Georgia Force/San Jose SaberCats vs. Chicago Rush) on 40 player helmets. The device is projected to sell for $30 if it is to become available on the market. The players that were given the device play positions that are susceptible to hard hits, such as wide receivers, defensive backs, running backs, and linebackers. AFL Players Association regional director James Guidry stated that the red light does not mean that the player has a concussion, but as a warning for team examiners to inspect the player. Guidry also said that the device could be used to prevent players who do not want to show any signs of weakness after sustaining any concussion-like symptoms from continuing to play.\nYouth football.\nYouth athletes make up 70% of football players in the United States. Every year there are 23,000 nonfatal traumatic brain injuries stemming from playing football that required an emergency visit to the hospital. Of those visits, 90% of them are children between the ages of 5–18 years old.\nA study conducted from 2010 to 2014 showed that of the 529 million emergency room visits; 819,000 were contact sport related. This accounted for 0.15% of all emergency visits. This number although small, may affect and cause ramifications in the American healthcare system. These figures are represented with nearly 80-90% of that of the youth population (ages 7–18).\nOne of the first studies of its kind was performed during the Fall 2011 football season when researchers from Virginia Tech, receiving permission from parents, placed accelerometers (which measure g forces) inside the helmets of seven youth players. These seven players were 7- and 8-year-old boys participating in a community youth league who were chosen because they were expected to have high participation and also because they wore at least a youth medium Riddell Revolution helmet (enabling the accelerometers, battery, and wireless transmitter to fit inside the helmet within the padding). That is, these seven were not a random selecting of players. Rather, the purpose of this study was to establish a baseline of what range of hits are generally expected.\nAs way of comparison, a collision of 80g is a big hit in a college football game of which there might be only six per game. And the range of 80, 90, or 100g is generally where risk of acute injury and concussion begins to occur (concussion being symptoms such as feeling foggy or woozy and not necessarily loss of consciousness). An example of a lesser force of 40g is heading a soccer ball, and even with blows in this 30 to 40g range, it is not known whether these pose a cumulative risk of injury.\nThis 2011 study measured a total 753 impacts among these seven players with a median impact of 15g. It did, however, observe 38 impacts of 40g or greater, and six impacts of greater than 80g. Fortunately, none of these youth players experienced a concussion. There is also a concern that since many young players have less developed chest and neck muscles than older players, almost every impact potentially acts likes a surprise hit.\nA Virginia Tech doctor stated that reducing the number of higher hits during practice sessions constitutes a real opportunity. Of the 38 impacts of 40g or greater, 29 took place during practice. And of the six impacts greater than 80g, all took place during practice.\nOne Pop Warner game in particular in 2012 resulted in five concussions. In 2015, a family sued Pop Warner over the suicide of a former player who was later found to have CTE, claiming that the organization knew or should have known about the risk of head injuries. Several other lawsuits have been filed against Pop Warner for related cases.\nThe Center for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC's) has developed the \"Heads Up concussion in Youth Sports.\" It helps youth coaches, players, and parents be more aware of a concussion. Heads up provides important information on preventing, recognizing and responding to a concussion. 63% of youth coaches viewed concussions being more serious, 72% said they are educating others about concussions, and 50% had learned something new.\nAccording to the Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM), kids who begin playing football before the age of twelve are at a greater risk of depression, behavioral regulation, apathy, and executive functioning. Michael Alosco, PhD lead author for the (BUSM) states, \"This study adds to growing research suggesting that incurring repeated head impacts through tackle football before the age of 12 can lead to a greater risk for short- and long-term neurological consequences\".\nConcussions in high school football.\nConcussions are frequent in high school football. Football has the highest rate of concussion among high school sports, with about 11 concussions occurring per 10,000 athletic exposures. About 50 high school or younger football players across the country were killed or sustained serious head injuries on the field since 1997.\nMany concussions that occur during high school football often go untreated and are not monitored. This is a big concern because repeated trauma to the head, especially injuries with concussion like symptoms, puts a young athlete's health at serious risk. A 2013 study by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center found that, despite knowing the risk of serious injury from continuing to play with a concussion, half of high school football players would still play if they had a headache from an injury sustained on the field. Researchers surveyed 120 high school football players. Of those students, 30 reported having suffered a concussion. More than 90 percent recognized the risk of serious injury if they returned to play too quickly, but more than half of those aware of the risks responded they would \"always or sometimes continue to play with a headache sustained from an injury\", and only 54 percent indicated they would \"always or sometimes report symptoms of a concussion to their coach.\" Another study found that 15.8% of football players who sustain a concussion severe enough to cause loss of consciousness return to play the same day. Due to the fact that only 42% of high schools have access to athletic training services, there has been a large debate regarding the risks that high school football players face.\nEleven high schools in North Central Florida agreed to take a written questionnaire evaluating the varsity football teams' knowledge about concussions. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board for the Protection of Human Research Subjects by the University of Florida. The review consisted of three sections. First was to identify symptoms of a concussion, second what they believed were possible consequences from not getting the proper treatment of a concussion, and the last section was to indicate if they have ever received information about concussions. 25% of them had never received information about concussion and only 54% had talked about the issue of a concussion with a parent.\nPrevention efforts.\nNumerous efforts have attempted to identify potential concussions quickly. Helmet shock data loggers and impact sensors help monitor impacts a player receives. One example is a device created by Schutt Sports during the Arena Football League's 2008 season known as the \"Shockometer\"—a triangle-shaped object with adhesive on its side that sticks to players' helmets. When a player gets hit by a g-force which exceeds 98, a capsule with a green light in it will change to a red light. Doctors have determined that a g-force of approximately 100 will increase the risk of a concussion, even though a quarterback that gets sacked would normally register a g-force of 150 g. A possible flaw to the Shockometer is that fan activity could accidentally trigger the device. Riddell created the Head Impact Telemetry System (HITS) and Sideline Response System (SRS) to help record the frequency and severity of player impacts during practices and games. Every HITS helmet features MX Encoders, which would automatically record every hit. Eight NFL teams had planned to use the system in the season, but it was ultimately not used. In 2013, Reebok developed the Head Impact Indicator, which is a quarter-sized device placed on a player's skull, which activates a red/yellow light if the player is hit too hard. Similarly to Reebok's Impact Indicator, Battle Sport Science has released the Impact Indicator 2.0. The Impact Indicator 2.0 looks to increase long-term brain safety for all those who play football. On February 3, 2013, the NFL and General Electric partnered on a five-year, $50 million project to develop technology to predict brain injuries, show injury severity and the rate of recovery, and to create more protective material. There is now another company that has taken on the responsibility of attempting to limit the number of concussions in the game of football. Vicis, a Seattle-based firm, has created a new unique type of helmet that is very flexible due to the many layers that make up this new intricate helmet. This helmet consists of four layers, beginning with the Lode Shell. This layer absorbs the shock from the hit, which then leads to the Core Layer contorting and bending in all directions. This technology alleviates stress from the impact, which consists of all the linear and rotational forces involved in the hit. The Arch Shell exists directly under the Core Layer and is precisely designed to fit a player's head shape. The last layer, the Form Liner, works with the Arch Shell to apportion pressure evenly around the perimeter of the head. Instead of measuring a player's head the conventional way by taking the circumference, Vicis measures the length and width of the head to get more accurate data. A better fit of the helmet allows for the technology to work more advantageously. Several NFL players have tried this new helmet and have provided great feedback. Cliff Avril from the Seattle Seahawks said, \"You don't feel the thuds as hard as they normally are.\" In the NFL's 2017 Helmet Laboratory Testing Performance Results, the Vicis helmet finished first out of the 33 helmets that could have been worn in 2017 NFL season. Concussion-preventing technology continues to improve the safety in the game of football.\nNFL.\nSean Morey, who was named cochair of the NFL Player Association's Concussion and Traumatic Brain Injury Committee in October 2009, told Brown Alumni Magazine in early 2010 that \"fifty percent of concussions go unreported.\" Morey said that players kept their injuries secret because they felt bound by loyalty and feared job loss.\nSince then, the National Football League has made numerous rule changes to reduce the number of concussions suffered by players while making the game safer.\nIn 2010, the NFL reworded the League's rules to prohibit a player from \"launching himself off the ground and using his helmet to strike a player in a defenseless posture in the head or neck.\" Violations of this rule only result in the imposition of a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty. In the same season, the NFL mandated that once a player loses his helmet on the playing field, the current play must immediately be whistled dead.\nAlso in 2010, the NFL mandated that during field goals or extra point attempts, defenders must line up with their entire bodies on the outside of the snapper's body to protect the snapper while he is in a position of vulnerability. Violations of this rule, however, result in only a five-yard penalty for illegal formation.\nThe Competition Committee reviews all competitive aspects of the game, including playing rules, roster regulations, technology, game-day operations and player protection. The process for modifying or adopting rules and regulations is systematic and consensus-oriented.\nTo reinforce the seriousness of the rule changes, in the middle of the 2010 season, Commissioner Goodell issued a memo to all NFL teams stating that \"more significant discipline, including suspensions, will be imposed on players that strike an opponent in the head or neck area in violation of the rules.\"\nThe most drastic step the NFL has taken to reduce head injuries was the 2010 change to the NFL kickoff rules. To reduce what has been referred to as one of the most violent plays in the game, the kickoff was moved up from the 30-yard line to the 35-yard line. The NFL also outlawed the use of the three-man wedge on kickoffs, while allowing the two-man wedge to remain a legal play. Consequently, players on the kicking team must now line up closer to midfield, reducing the amount of space the players have in which to get a running start.\nIn 2011, the NFL also mandated that certified athletic trainers be available in press boxes during all NFL games. These athletic trainers assist medical personnel located on the sidelines in identifying potential concussions because the symptoms are often difficult to spot and assess from the field level.\nOn March 20, 2013, the NFL voted to introduce yet another new rule aimed at player safety. Starting in the 2013–2014 season, if a running back lowers the crown of his helmet while he is inside the tackle box or while he is less than three yards downfield and makes contact with a defender, the team will be given a 15-yard penalty.\nAfter three years of declines in reported cases, the 2015 regular season contained a spike in reported concussions even after making several safety improvements the previous year. The total cases reported for the practices, pre-season, and regular season was 271, a 31.6 percent spike. The 2015 cases reported for regular season games was 182, a 58.3 percent spike.\nIn the 2016 offseason, the NFL implemented a new policy to their concussion protocol. The NFL can now punish teams that do not follow their concussion protocol by imposing a monetary fine or taking away their draft picks. The first violation can be a fine up to $150,000 and the second violation can be a fine no less than $100,000 and a possible removal of draft picks. In 2017, the Seattle Seahawks were under much scrutiny for violating the NFL's concussion protocol by allowing Russell Wilson to return to the game against the Arizona Cardinals without the proper treatment. The Seattle Seahawks failed to have Wilson cleared by a team doctor and an independent physician before allowing him to return to the game. The NFL investigated the incident and imposed a $100,000 fine on the Seahawks.\nWFA.\nThe Women's Football Alliance has come a long way when it comes to the guidelines on making the game safer for its players.\nFrom 2012 to 2017 they have since made it illegal to send a player back into the game with suspicions of a concussion unless cleared by a certified health official.\nYouth football.\nReturn to play guidelines (RTPs), such as Washington State's Lystedt Law, have been legally mandated since 2009. All 50 states, and Washington, D.C., have now passed legislation to help reduce the number of traumatic brain injuries in youth football.\nSenator Dick Durbin, from Illinois, introduced the Protecting Student Athletes from Concussions Act on September 25, 2013, to the U.S. Senate. This act would require athletes, parents, coaches and school officials to be informed of the risks of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and it would also require the \"when in doubt, sit it out\" policy to be used with athletes that have been suspected of having a concussion and be removed from the field of play. A press release from Senator Durbin stated that many major U.S. sports organizations, including the NFL and NHL, endorsed the bill.\nIn 2016, the Pop Warner league banned kickoffs in an attempt to reduce high-speed collisions that result in concussions.\nScreening procedure.\nIn September 2015, researchers with the Department of Veterans Affairs and Boston University announced that they had identified CTE in 96 percent of NFL players that they had examined and in 79 percent of all football players.\nAs of February 2015, Gary Small and colleagues have been called into question by the FDA for their overzealous commercialization and promotion of clinically unproven screening that fellow peer researchers deem fit only for research and they have responded by withdrawing related materials from their website.\nTo date, all screening procedures that examine football players for brain damage have been post mortem. In 2013, Gary Small and colleagues developed an in vivo chemical tracer that can detect tau protein build up in living players. Small and his team invented this new chemical tracer, 2-(1-{6-[(2-[F-18]fluoroethyl)(methyl)amino]-2-naphthyl}ethylidene)malononitrile, or FDDNP, that could be used in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans. This new tracer measures for tau protein and amyloid plaque accumulation in human brains; symptoms of repetitive brain trauma among other things. Although tracers have been developed to screen for the build-up of tau proteins in the human brain, FDDNP is the first PET tracer that can be used in vivo in human trials. FDDNP was originally developed in an effort to detect Alzheimer's in elderly individuals, thus the article was published in the journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry. However, because there are similarities between Alzheimer's and the effects of Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy (CTE), FDDNP was used to study the extent of brain trauma in consenting, retired NFL players.\nSmall and colleagues performed a controlled experiment on retired NFL players and an equal number of control participants. Unfortunately the sample size was very small as only 5 players of the 19 contacted were eligible for the study. Though the sample size was small, a good range of positions were represented (linebacker, quarterback, offensive lineman, defensive lineman, and a center) and all players had played in the league at least 10 years. The players had to be at least 45 years of age and currently exhibit symptoms of cognitive and mood disruption. Control participants had to meet certain criteria as well to ensure that they were as similar as possible to the NFL players in order to eliminate any biases or confounding variables. Age, Body Mass Index (BMI), years of education, and family history of dementia were all selected as the selection criteria for control participants. All participants received intravenous injections of the FDDNP tracer and were tested over 4 weeks using PET imaging technology.\nThe injection of the FDDNP tracer was successful, and the results of the study showed significant differences between the NFL players and control participants. The NFL players had significantly higher FDDNP signals than control participants, indicating a greater amount of tau protein accumulation. The cortical regions of all the participants studied showed no significant difference, but the NFL players had FDDNP levels that were significantly higher in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, sub thalamus, midbrain, and cerebellar white matter regions of the brain as compared to the control participants. In addition, a positive correlation was found between the number of head injuries the players sustained and the levels of FDDNP binding. This suggests that players with a more severe history of head trauma will likely have significantly more accumulation of tau protein. This, in turn, gives rise to the suggestion that a more severe history of head trauma will result in greater deterioration of the brain, cognitive functioning, and mood regulation.\nThe findings of the study were consistent with previous autopsy studies of individuals with CTE. The important distinction to make, however, is that the patients in Small's study were not on the slab and walked out after testing was completed. This is monumental in the field of brain trauma and concussion research.\nBased on recent new blood tests; evidence is revealing no change in blood plasma tau and serum neurofilament light concentrations following sport related concussions. However these levels did rise in more severe concussion sport related injuries. This can potentially suggest that a new blood test be developed and help aid in identifying the severity of concussion, and assist in concussion protocols.\nRecovery efforts.\nConcussions are proven to cause loss of brain function. This can lead to physical and emotional symptoms such as attention disorders, depression, headaches, nausea, and amnesia. These symptoms can last for days or weeks and even after the symptoms have gone, the brain still will not be completely normal. Players with multiple concussions can have drastically worsened symptoms and exponentially increased recovery time.\nResearchers at UCLA used a brain-imaging tool to identify a certain protein found in five retired NFL players. The presence and accumulation of tau proteins found in the five living players, are associated with Alzheimer's disease. Previously, this type of exam could only be performed with an autopsy. Scientists at UCLA created a chemical marker that binds to the abnormal proteins and they are able to view this with positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Researcher at UCLA, Gary Small explains, \"Providing a non-invasive method for early detection is a critical first step in developing interventions to prevent symptom onset and progression in CTE\".\nPost-concussive symptoms (PCS) is an area of recovery that is often not discussed. New evidence suggest that new recovery protocols have been recommended and designed to more adequately and efficiently recover from concussions. PCS is a concussion symptom lasting longer than 14 days. Current protocols suggest that the athlete refrain from any physical activity until symptoms free. However, according to the Journal of Athletic Training \"a physiological approach to prolonged recovery from sport-related concussion\" suggests some aerobic activity may be beneficial to more appropriate healing from concussion, and may lessen the reoccurrence of repeated concussions.\nThere has been promising evidence that blood flow restriction based exercises can be used to improve Post-Concussion Syndrome (PCS). \"The leading theory supporting this is that human growth hormone is released in response to increased lactate production from exercise, enhancing the brain function and recovery\". This exercise based program could potentially be used in conjunction with aerobic therapy to better improve concussion symptoms during the recovery process.\nAs of 2011, all 32 NFL teams are required to have at least one Physical Therapist on staff. Physical Therapist can help with current and former NFL players that have experienced a concussion. A Vestibular Physical Therapist can create customized treatment for dizziness and balance dysfunction associated with a concussion."

        "text": "The men's artistic individual all-around event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1928 Summer Olympics. It was one of seven gymnastics events for men and was the seventh Olympic men's all-around gymnastic championship. Scores from the individual apparatus events were added to give aggregate scores for the individual all-around; individual all-around scores were similarly summed for the team all-around event. There were 88 competitors from 11 nations. Each nation sent a team of 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Georges Miez of Switzerland, with his countryman Hermann Hänggi taking silver. They were the first medals in the event for Swiss gymnasts since 1904 and the first gold medal ever for a Swiss man in the individual all-around. Defending Olympic champion Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia finished with the bronze this time, making him the third man to win multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the men's individual all-around. The first individual all-around competition had been held in 1900, after the 1896 competitions featured only individual apparatus events. A men's individual all-around has been held every Games since 1900.\nSeven of the top 10 gymnasts from the 1924 Games returned: gold medalist Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia, bronze medalist Bedřich Šupčík of Czechoslovakia, fourth-place finisher Ferdinando Mandrini of Italy, sixth-place finisher Ladislav Vácha of Czechoslovakia, seventh-place finisher August Güttinger of Switzerland, eighth-place finisher (and 1920 bronze medalist) Jean Gounot of France, and tenth-place finisher Mario Lertora of Italy. Reigning World Champion Peter Šumi of Yugoslavia did not compete in Amsterdam, but second-place finisher Josef Effenberger and third-place finisher Ladislav Vácha, both of Czechoslovakia, did.\nFor the first time, no nations made their debut in the event. France and Italy each made their sixth appearance, tied for most among nations, both having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nBy 1928, the format for the all-around competition had begun to settle after changing widely in the earlier Games. The 1924 Games (roughly following the precedent of 1904) used an aggregate score of the various apparatus events for an individual all-around championship; the 1928 tournament continued with that format. The rope climbing exercise was dropped, however. The 1928 all-around consisted of 10 exercises on 5 apparati. The compulsory and optional exercises for the parallel bars, horizontal bar, rings, and pommel horse were worth from 0 to 30 points each (with each apparatus from 0 to 60), while the compulsory (sidehorse) vault and optional (regular) vault exercises were worth from 0 to 15 points each (with 0 to 30 total for the vault competition). Thus, the total possible all-around score was 270.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael"

        "text": "The men's single sculls event was part of the rowing programme at the 1928 Summer Olympics. It was one of seven rowing events for men and was the seventh appearance of the event, which had been on the programme for every Games since rowing was added in 1900. There were 15 competitors, each from a different nation (as each nation could enter only one boat in the event). The event was won by Bobby Pearce of Australia, the nation's first medal in the event. Silver went to Ken Myers of the United States, extending that nation's podium streak to three Games (and making the nation four-for-four in reaching the podium each time it appeared). David Collet of Great Britain took bronze; that nation had also earned a medal each time it appeared (six times) and had a five-Games podium streak.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The single sculls has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nNone of the rowers from the 1924 Games returned. Two-time medalist and reigning champion Jack Beresford competed in the eight, but not the single sculls. The 1928 Diamond Challenge Sculls winner was Joseph Wright Jr. of Canada; he was the closest thing to a favorite in a relatively open field.\nJapan and South Africa each made their debut in the event. Great Britain made its sixth appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1904 Games in St. Louis.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1928 competition expanded the repechage system introduced in 1924, giving losing rowers a second chance at advancement. However, the number of rowers in each race was once again limited to two after multiple Games with more than two boats per race. These changes led to the tournament having a total of seven rounds (five main rounds and two repechages).\nThe course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael\nRound 1.\nWinners advanced to the second round. Losers competed in the first repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nWinners advanced to the second round, but were ineligible for a second repechage if they lost there. Losers were eliminated.\nRound 2.\nWinners advanced to the third round. Losers competed in the second repechage, if they had advanced by winning in the first round, or were eliminated if they had advanced through the first repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nWinners advanced to the third round, while losers were eliminated.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe competition became single-elimination from this point, with losers being eliminated even if they had not previously had to advance through a repechage.\nSemifinals.\nWinners advanced to the gold medal final, with the losers competing for bronze."

        "title": "Patricia Brown (baseball)",
        "text": "Patricia Irene Brown (April 23, 1931 – June 17, 2012) was a pitcher who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5' 5\", 135 lb., she batted and threw right handed.\nLike many players, Pat Brown had a brief career in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League because she felt that the schedule was demanding and the continuing trips interfered with her studies. She then went on to obtain four degrees and be listed in four different \"Who's Who\" directories for her accomplishments during a law librarian career that spanned forty years of dedicated service to Suffolk University in Boston.\nBorn in Winthrop, Massachusetts, Patricia was the youngest of four children in the family of Joseph and Harriet (née Taylor) Brown. While growing up, she had two dreams: to play baseball and to attend college. She was told she could not play baseball because she was a girl and could not attend college because she had no money. Nevertheless, she achieved both of these dreams.\nBrown started playing sandlot ball at an early age with her brothers Joseph Jr., Thomas and Alan and their neighborhood friends. \"Playing sandlot baseball was a real struggle for me at first. I was so tired of hearing that I should go home and play with my dolls that I wanted to cry\", she remembered. But the young Pat did not scream at the boys. She just bided her time. \"From time in time I played first base, second base, and shortstop, as well all three outfield positions. I never dared to volunteer to be the catcher, and luckily no one ever asked me to catch\", she added.\nFrom 1946 through 1948 Brown attended Winthrop High School, where she excelled in basketball, field hockey and tennis. Under the direction of Ellen Kiernan, she was a member of the field hockey team that played outside schools for the first time since before World War II.\nNevertheless, Brown did not play organized softball until being in high school. Even Little League Baseball had started in 1939 in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, Winthrop did not as yet have a Little League team. Not that it mattered to her, because girls were not allowed to play baseball. It not was until 1974 that Little League announced, almost reluctantly, that its teams were open to girls.\nFollowing her graduation, Brown became interested in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League after reading about it in a Boston newspaper. She sent a letter to the league's headquarters in Chicago. Pretty soon she received a letter asking her to come to a tryout involving hundreds of girls. She was not considered, but in 1950 a second chance came. This time she made a good impression on the league's scouts with her strong throwing arm. \"Finding women who could pitch was a problem for the league\", she explained.\nBrown was signed as a pitcher and was assigned to the Kenosha Comets. But Comets manager Johnny Gottselig felt she had control issues and need refinement, so she was sent to the Chicago Colleens development touring team. Brown was promoted to the Battle Creek Belles in 1951, but she did not have much of a chance to show her abilities.\nShe collected a 9-9 pitching record for the Colleens, while posting a .298 batting average and a .394 on-base percentage in 23 games. Her stint with the Belles was limited to two innings of shutout ball in one pitching appearance.\nBrown attended Suffolk University during the off-season, but when the college would not release her early in order to play and the league would not allow her to report late in the season, she opted to quit baseball and decided to concentrate on her studies.\nShe then earned Bachelor of Arts (1955), Juris Doctor (1965) and Master of Business Administration (1970) degrees from Suffolk University, and a MTS degree from Gordon–Conwell Theological Seminary (1977).\nBrown was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar Association in 1965. She received her Librarian's Certification in 1963 and her Law Librarian's Certification in 1967. She then had a 40-year career as the Law Librarian and Professor at Suffolk University. In addition, she was a longtime member of the Winthrop Council on Aging; the SHINE Program (Serving Health Information Needs of Elders) counseling at the Winthrop Senior Center, retiring as a Law Librarian Emeritus in 1992.\nIn 1988 Brown received further recognition when she became part of \"Women in Baseball\", a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\nThen, in September 1990, she was invited to throw the ceremonial first pitch at a Boston Red Sox home game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Fenway Park. She was joined in the ceremony by Patricia Courtney, Maddy English and Mary Pratt, other Massachusetts residents who played significant roles in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\nBesides this, Brown received numerous awards and recognitions over the years. She appears listed in the \"Who's Who in America\", \"Who's Who in American Law\", \"Who's Who in the East\", and \"Who's Who of American Women\" directories.\nIn February 1990, the Women's Sports Foundation presented her with an award \"For Outstanding Service in Women's Sports\", during the governor's annual Massachusetts Women in Sports Day at the State House in Boston. She also was honored at the dedication of the Suffolk University girls' basketball team first home game in their new gym in February 1991, and was inducted in the First Annual Winthrop High School Hall of Fame in March 1997.\nBy 1993, she spent over a year working with the New England Sports Museum to organize an All-American Girls Professional Baseball League display. She formed a working group that included former AAGPBL players Wilma Briggs and Marie Mansfield, as well as the aforementioned Maddy English, Mary Pratt and herself, of course. The finished exhibition contains assorted pictures, an original contract, and baseball spikes, gloves and uniforms, among other memorabilia.\nShe wrote \"A League Of My Own: Memoir of a Pitcher for the All-American Girls\", which was published by McFarland &amp; Company, in 2003. In her book, she shares her thoughts on the league's history, including what Philip K. Wrigley sought to do by creating the AAGPBL in 1943, what happened after that, and why the league folded after its twelve years of existence. \"I feel like I have finally pitched my no-hit game\", she commented about her book.\nPatricia Brown died in Park Ridge, Illinois, at the age of 81."

        "text": "The 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup was the 18th tournament of the FIBA Basketball World Cup for men's national basketball teams, held from 31 August to 15 September 2019. The tournament was hosted in China and was rescheduled from 2018 to 2019, becoming the first since 1967 that did not occur in the same year as the FIFA World Cup (which was held the previous year). The tournament expanded from 24 to 32 teams.\nThe tournament also served as qualification for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which took the top two teams from each of the Americas and Europe, and the top team from each of Africa, Asia and Oceania, alongside the tournament's host Japan. Montenegro and the Czech Republic each made their first appearance as independent nations after previously being part of Serbia and Montenegro and Czechoslovakia respectively, while Poland marked its return to the FIBA Basketball World Cup for the first time since 1967.\nThe defending champions, the United States, experienced their worst result at a World Cup, losing to France in the quarter-finals and Serbia in the subsequent classification game. The United States' previous worst result was sixth place in 2002. This was the first World Cup at which all three of the historically most successful teams (United States, Serbia/Yugoslavia and Russia/Soviet Union) failed to reach the semi-finals. Asian powerhouse and hosts China failed to get out of the first round, losing in shocking upsets to Poland and Venezuela. China ultimately missed the Asian qualifying spot for Tokyo, the first time in the country's history they did not qualify directly for the Olympics.\nSpain captured their second title after beating Argentina in the final 95–75. It was the second time Spain had reached a World Cup final, and its second win, while for Argentina it would prove to be its second defeat in three attempts. France went on to win the bronze medal for the second consecutive time after defeating Australia 67–59.\nHosts selection.\nThe whole bidding process started in April 2014. Bids from numerous nations were submitted. On 16 March 2015, it was confirmed that the World Cup would be staged in Asia, with China and Philippines as the final countries to be the basis for the selection of the host. On 7 August 2015, it was announced that China won the bid against the Philippines and will host the upcoming World Cup.\nQualification.\nChina as the hosts automatically qualified for the tournament. The continental championships were no longer the qualification system for the World Cup. Instead, two rounds of continental qualifying tournaments were held over two years.\nThe first round of the Americas, Asia/Oceania and Africa qualifiers featured 16 teams each, whereas Europe had 32 teams. Division A teams were split in groups of four, to be held in a home-and-away round-robin. The top three teams in each groups advanced to round two, and the last placed teams played the best Division B teams to qualify for the next season's Division A.\nIn round two of the World Cup qualifiers, teams were split in groups of six, totalling four groups in Europe and two in the other qualifiers. Teams carried over the points from round one, and faced other three teams again in a home-and-away round-robin. The best teams in each group qualified for the World Cup.\nStarting 2019, no wild card selection was held, and the Olympic champions were not guaranteed a spot in the tournament.\nThe draw for the qualifiers was held on 7 May 2017 in Guangzhou.\nMontenegro and the Czech Republic debuted in the World Cup. Montenegro was formerly a part of Yugoslavia, and later, Serbia and Montenegro teams, while the Czech Republic was a part of the old Czechoslovakia. Poland was returning to the World Cup, after participating in 1967. Canada, China, Germany, Ivory Coast, Russia, and Tunisia were returning to the World Cup after missing out in 2014. Croatia, Egypt, Finland, Mexico, Slovenia, and Ukraine were the teams that participated in 2014 that did not qualify in 2019. Brazil and the United States qualified in 2019, continuing their streaks in participating in all World Cups.\nSquads.\nEach team had a final roster of 12 players; a team can opt to have one naturalized player as per FIBA eligibility rules from its roster.\nReferees.\nThe following referees were selected for the tournament.\n1 – Suspended after the match France vs. Lithuania.\nPreparation games.\nSeveral teams participated in official tournaments or in exhibition ones, either ad hoc or already existing ones, to prepare for the World Cup.\nPan American Games.\nAn official and traditional tournament in the Americas. Out of the eight teams from the tournament, five already qualified to the World Cup. Of these five, all except the United States had players expected to be in the World Cup rosters, with the USA playing with collegiate players. Argentina defeated Puerto Rico to win the gold medal.\nAcropolis International Basketball Tournament.\nAn exhibition tournament. All four participating teams used the Acropolis Tournament as a warm-up. Serbia topped the table to win the championship, ahead of Greece.\nAustiger Cup.\nAn exhibition tournament. The four teams played in this tournament hosted by China as a warm-up to the World Cup. Serbia topped the table to win the championship, ahead of France.\nMálaga Tournament.\nAn exhibition tournament. Four teams participated in a preparation tournament hosted in Málaga, Spain. It was contested by Spain, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ivory Coast, and the Philippines.\nOther games.\nExhibition games were held as warm-ups for the World Cup. The United States defeated Spain in the Honda Center in Anaheim, which was between the top two teams in the FIBA World Rankings. Australia's defeat of the United States in Marvel Stadium, Melbourne in the 2019 Australian International Basketball series was the first USA team's loss with NBA players since its 2006 FIBA World Championship semifinals loss to Greece. The USA is the second-youngest team in the tournament and features only two players with international experience. Notably the US is missing over 30 of their best players, who opted out either due to injury, or to prepare for the NBA season.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was played in three stages. During the first stage, the 32 qualified teams were sorted into eight groups of four (A-H) and each team in a group played the other three teams once. The top two teams from each group then advanced to the second group stage. In the second group stage, there were four groups of four (I-L) made up of the teams that advanced from the first round, with the teams that have not yet played each other facing off against one another once. The top two teams from groups I to L will qualify for the final knockout phase.\nClassification rounds were revived after they were not held in 2014. They were traditionally held in every World Championship/World Cup and were last seen in action in 2010.\nIn total, 92 games were played over a total of 16 days.\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 16 March 2019 at Shenzhen Cultural Center in Shenzhen.\nHosts China and the three best qualified teams as per the February 2019 FIBA World Rankings were seeded in Pot 1, and China and USA were assigned to groups A and E, respectively.

The logo's concept was inspired from the Beijing Opera where the actors symbolize concepts such as wisdom, persistence, power and perfection, which are prerequisite characteristics that the participating players of national team will need to exhibit \"in order to succeed\". The logo design was also inspired from the Chinese Dragon Dance, a cultural tradition depicting a story of two flying dragons battling over a shining pearl which is meant to parallel the competition of national teams for the Naismith Trophy. The logo was created by Shanghai-based agency Flagship.\nSponsors.\nInfront China became the exclusive marketing partner for the domestic commercial rights of FIBA Basketball World Cup China 2019, according to a strategic cooperation agreement officially announced between Infront China, a Wanda Sports company, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the Organizing Committee for the competition.\nMascot.\nAn international mascot design competition was organized with the winning mascot chosen by fans. Yan Xu's design, a Chinese Dragon-inspired mascot named Son of Dreams, was announced to be the winning mascot on 18 April 2018. Son of Dreams was born in China on 8 August 2015 one day after China was announced as the host according to the mascot's fictional biography. The magical horns of the mascot is described as having the ability to give the dragon \"the power to see in the future, envisioning plays and moves before they actually happen\". He wears a red and blue uniform with the tournament's logo and high tops by China's top player Yao Ming. The mascot was chosen over other finalists Speed Tiger who was inspired by a Siberian tiger and QiuQiu (a.k.a. Little Lightning) who was inspired by a Chinese lion. The official mascot made his first public appearance on 28 June 2018 in Shenzhen.\nBall.\nOn 16 March 2019, FIBA revealed the official ball that would be used in the World Cup, Molten BG5000, designed by Molten.\nOfficial song.\nThe song \"Champion\" was released on 24 July 2019, and performed by American singer-songwriter Jason Derulo featuring Chinese singer Tia Ray. It was performed both in English and the host language Chinese.\nIssues and concerns.\nThere were concerns from national federations that they would not be able to play the qualifiers with players from top professional leagues globally (the National Basketball Association and EuroLeague), which was possible with professional leagues operating in mid-year.\nBroadcasters.\nThe television rights holders by territory as follows:\nControversy.\nAustralian center and NBA champion Andrew Bogut voiced concerns on the officiating in the semi-final match against Spain. During the match after a call he disagreed with, Bogut was seen gesturing with his hands that the officials had been bribed. Post-match, he claimed that it was a \"disgrace\" and encouraged people to look into where the headquarters are based. 3-time NBA champion and Australian assistant coach was less accusative but also cited their run of luck with officiating when the two sides meet.\nPatrick Mills was also controversially snubbed from the All-Star Five. Even being told he had been in the five before being omitted. Many fans and journalists felt that Mills should have been part of the All-Star Five."

        "title": "David Jacobs (table tennis)",
        "text": "Dian David Mickael Jacobs (21 June 1977 – 28 April 2023) was an Indonesian athlete who competed in table tennis, primarily Class 10 para table tennis. Born in Ujung Pandang, he took up table tennis at the age of ten and rose quickly through national tournaments. He was training to play internationally by 2000, and in 2001 he won his first gold medal, at the SEATTA Championships in Singapore. After 2010 he competed in para table tennis, having spent most of his career competing against athletes with full functionality. Having lost control in his right hand, he decided to compete in the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, winning a bronze medal.\nEarly life.\nJacobs was born in Ujung Pandang (now Makassar) on 21 June 1977. He was of Ambonese descent. He began playing table tennis at age ten, with the support of his parents Jan and Nell, as well as his brothers Rano, Piere, and Joe; his three brothers also play table tennis. In 1989 his parents registered him with the PTP Club in Semarang; in his two years with the club, he became a national champion at the elementary-school level.\nWhen Jacobs was ready to begin his junior high school, the family moved to Jakarta. Jacobs was signed with UMS 80 Club. He continued to improve and joined the provincial team. In 1997 he was sent to Beijing to train at the Shi Cha Hai Sports School. By 2000 Jacobs was already being prepared to compete at the international level by the Indonesian Table Tennis Association. \n Jacobs was married to Jeanny Palar, with whom he has one child.\nTable tennis career.\nWhile earning a degree in management from the Perbanas School of Economics, Jacobs continued training. He participated in his first Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) in 2001. Together with Yon Mardiono, in 2001 Jacobs won Indonesia's only gold medal at the SEATTA table tennis championship in Singapore. In the men's doubles competition, they defeated the Thai duo Phucong Sanguansin and Phakphoom Sanguansin in three matches, scoring 11–4, 11–4, and 11–6. Paired with Mardiono for the first time for this tournament, Jacobs told \"The Jakarta Post\" that they \"were determined not to let ourselves be dominated\".\nJacobs continued to play at the SEA Games, competing in Vietnam (2003), the Philippines (2005), and Thailand (2007). He won the 2004 Pekan Olahraga Nasional competition for table tennis, which led to him receiving an honorary position at the Department of Sport; he became a full-time employee there in 2008. In 2008, Jacobs served as a coach for the Indonesian men's table tennis team, and in 2009 he competed at the SEA Games in Kuala Lumpur.\nPara table tennis career.\nJacobs began playing in para table tennis tournaments later that year, becoming a member of the National Paralympic Committee in 2010. He competed in Class 10, which is the highest level of functionality in the system. He usually trained with opponents who maintained full functionality. Jacobs himself had a problem with one of his hands.\nAt the 2010 Asian Para Games in Guangzhou, China, Jacobs won a bronze medal. Before the competition, he had only a month to train. He competed in several international tournaments, winning a gold in Thailand, silver in Beijing, bronze in the Czech Republic, silver in the United Kingdom, and gold in Taiwan. At the 2011 ASEAN Para Games in Surakarta, Jacobs won seven gold medals: men's singles (open), men's doubles (open), mixed doubles (open), men's doubles, mixed doubles, team, and single. In January of the following year, Jacobs took on Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in a three-game series. Although the president won one game with a score of 13–11, Jacobs took the series, winning two games with the scores of 11–7 and 11–9. After the competition, Yudhoyono gave a speech on the need to support Indonesia's disabled athletes.\nIn March 2012, Jacobs won two gold medals at the Protour Paratable Tennis Lignano Open in Italy. In the men's singles, he defeated Ivan Karabec of the Czech Republic with a score of 11–9, 11–7, and 11–8, while in the men's team play, he was paired with Komet Akbar and defeated teams from the Netherlands and Czech Republic. In June he won the Slovakian Table Tennis Tournament, ranking him among the top three in the world.\nJacobs was one of several athletes who represented Indonesia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London, with Ni Nengah Widiasih (powerlifting), the swimmer Agus Ngaimin, and an athletics competitor, Setyo Budi Hartanto. Jacobs won the bronze medal in the Table Tennis Men's Individual C10 classification. It was the nation's first Paralympic medal in over twenty years.\nDeath.\nOn the night of 27 April 2023, Jacobs was found unconscious near Juanda-Gambir railway in Gambir, Central Jakarta. He was rushed to Husada Hospital, and died there on 28 April 2023, at the age of 45.\nAchievements.\nParalympic Games.\n\"Men's singles\"\nWorld Championships.\n\"Men's singles\"\n\"Men's team\"\n\"Mixed doubles\"\nAsian Para Games.\n\"Men's singles\"\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Men's team\"\nAsian Championships.\n\"Men's singles\"\n\"Men's team\"\nSEA Games.\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Men's team\"\nASEAN Para Games.\n\"Men's singles\"\n\"Men's doubles\"\n\"Men's team\"\nSEATTA Championships.\n\"Men's doubles\"\nITTF Para Table Tennis Tour.\n\"Men's singles\""

        "title": "2012 France rugby union tour of Argentina",
        "text": "In June 2012, France toured Argentina to play two Tests against the Pumas. The French tour was one in a series of tours by northern teams to be hosted by southern hemisphere nations.\nThe previous French tour of Argentina took place in 2010 as part of a global Two Test tour of South Africa and Argentina, where France lost to both nations. France's last winning tour of Argentina dated back to 1998 when the touring side claimed victory in both Tests. Since then France had an overall losing record against Argentina with 5 wins (4 at home and 1 in Ireland in the 1999 Rugby World Cup) and 7 losses (3 at home including two in the 2007 Rugby World Cup and 4 in Argentina).\nNo mid-week fixture had been planned for this tour, however most of the French squad, styled for the occasion as the \"XV du Président\", played a warm-up fixture against a team hand-picked by Serge Betsen, a former France international, for his jubilee.\nThe series was drawn 1-1, Argentina winning the first test and France the second.\nArgentina and France's next encounter took place on 17 November 2012 on French soil as part of the 2012 end of year tests. France claimed another victory (39-22) against their old foes.\nBackground.\nArgentina experienced a strong start in the 2011 Rugby World Cup with a rather successful pool stage, finishing runners-up to England with three wins (over Georgia, Romania and Scotland) and a narrow loss to England (9-13). However, the Pumas were unable to capitalise on it when they met future World Champions the All Blacks in the quarter-finals, losing 33-10.\nFrance, on the other hand, experienced a rather slow start in the competition with two wins (over Japan and Canada) and two losses (to New Zealand and Tonga), finishing runners-up to New Zealand on the virtue of a greater tally of bonus points than Tonga (who also finished with two wins and two losses). However, France produced a stronger showing in the knock-out stages, beating England in the quarter-finals (19-12), Wales in the semi-finals (9-8) and losing with the narrowest of margins to New Zealand in the final (8-7).\nDue to the World Cup neither team played any Test in the 2011 end of year tests. On 2 January 2012 France was ranked 3rd in the IRB World Rankings while Argentina stood in the 7th place.\nFrance experienced a disappointing 2012 Six Nations Championship with two wins (over Italy and Scotland), two losses (to England and Wales) and a draw (with Ireland), finishing 4th overall.\nAs a result on 2 April France had dropped to the 6th place in the IRB Rankings while Argentina remained on the 7th spot.\nAs part of Italy's Summer Tour of Americas and prior to the arrival of the French team, Argentina played a Test against Italy on Saturday 9 June in San Juan. Argentina won the game 37-22.\nBefore the first test between France and Argentina they remained respectively on the 6th and 7th spot in the IRB Rankings.\nTouring squad.\nPhilippe Saint-André announced his 28-man France squad for the June tour to Argentina. Several key faces were rested, including captain Thierry Dusautoir.\nHead coach: Philippe Saint-André\nNote*: After he sustained an injury in the First Test, Yvan Watremez was replaced in the squad by Thomas Domingo. (Philippe Saint-André originally planned to call up Castres prop Yannick Forestier but the latter was touring Japan with the French Barbarians and no satisfactory travel arrangement could be made, hence prompting the return of Domingo in the French squad after he sustained an important injury prior to the 2011 Rugby World Cup which prevented him from taking part in the competition and playing the major part of the 2011-2012 season with his club.)\nNote**: Although they took part in the warm-up fixture, Geoffrey Doumayrou, Antoine Guillamon and Romain Martial failed to appear in any of the Tests, thus remaining uncapped at the end of the Tour.\nHome squad.\nArgentina's 29-man squad named for the 2012 June Tests against Italy and France. Coach Santiago Phelan decided not to select any player involved in the Top 14 playoffs, reserving his best squad for the upcoming 2012 Rugby Championship. Esteban Lozada was a late addition to the squad after his recovery from injury.\nHead coach: Santiago Phelan\nNote*: Matias Orlando failed to appear in any of the Tests against both Italy and France, thus remaining uncapped at the end of the Tour.\nAftermath.\nOn 25 June 2012 (after all mid-year Tests had been played) France stood at the 5th place (their best ranking since March 2012) in the IRB Rankings (thanks to their second test comprehensive victory over the Pumas and Wales' loss to Australia in their third test) while Argentina had dropped to the 8th spot (their worst ranking since March 2012).\nFrom August to October 2012, Argentina competed in the inaugural Rugby Championship (the new incarnation of the Tri Nations Series) with Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, finishing bottom of the table with a draw (at home against the Springboks) and five losses. On 8 October 2012 France and Argentina remained respectively at the 5th and 8th places of the IRB World ranking.\nAs part of the 2012 end of year tests the Pumas toured Wales, France and Ireland, playing one Test against each union. They beat the Welsh but lost to the two other unions while France recorded three straight wins (against Australia, Argentina and Samoa). At the end of their Tests France had climbed to the IRB rankings 4th place, their best ranking since February 2012, while Argentina had dropped to the 9th place, their worst ranking since September 2011. However following the fourth week of Tests (of which Argentina and France were not part) Argentina climbed back to the 8th place thanks to Wales' defeat by Australia over the weekend.\nAs a result on December 3 for the 2015 Rugby World Cup Pool Draw France was drawn in Pot 1 while Argentina was drawn in Pot 2 and they ended up in Pool D and C respectively, meaning they will not meet before the Quarter Finals.\nFrom February to March 2013, France competed in the Six Nations Championship (the 14th series following this format) with England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy and Wales, finishing bottom of the table with one win (at home against Scotland), a draw (in Ireland) and three losses (at home to Wales, in England and Italy). On 18 March 2013 France has dropped to the 6th place in the IRB rankings while Argentina remained on the 8th place.\nAs part of the 2013 mid-year tests, France will tour New Zealand in a Three-Test Series while Argentina will host England in a Two-Test Series and Georgia for a one-off Test."

The song was written by Lamar and Tyler \"T-Minus\" Williams, the latter of whom also produced the song. The song, mixed by Dr. Dre and Top Dawg's engineer Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali, propelled Lamar to mainstream popularity. The song peaked at number 17 on the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100, in its thirteenth week of charting, after gradually climbing up the chart. It debuted on the Hot 100 at number 100 and progressed from number 55 and 32 to its peak. \"Swimming Pools (Drank)\" also serves as Lamar's first entry on the UK Singles Chart, where it debuted at number 63.\nA music video was released to accompany the song in August 2012. It was featured in the 2013 game \"Saints Row IV\", the 2014 re-release of the game \"Grand Theft Auto V\", and on a 2013 episode of \"Grey's Anatomy\". On January 26, 2013, Lamar performed the song along with the third single \"Poetic Justice\" on \"Saturday Night Live\".

A review by the magazine \"Rolling Stone\" shared a summary of the video stating: \"In his new video for 'Swimming Pools (Drank),' Kendrick Lamar defies gravity, floating and tumbling in suspended space as liquor bottles fly upwards and smash into the ceiling. The rapper gets introspective on a woozy beat, considering the highs and lows of alcohol consumption and the sense of confidence it bestows upon the drinker. Lamar spends most of the video rapping alone, but color-filtered shots of a booze-soaked rager poke through the more contemplative scenes.\"\nRemixes.\nThe official remix featuring his Black Hippy cohorts – Ab-Soul, Jay Rock and Schoolboy Q was included as a bonus track on the Target deluxe edition of \"Good Kid, M.A.A.D City\". On March 14, 2013, producer Dev Hynes uploaded a reinterpreted rendition of the track by English R&amp;B group, Mutya Keisha Siobhan to his official SoundCloud page. The track, entitled \"Lay Down in Swimming Pools\", features an interpolation of the original Lamar song. Hynes later commented saying: \"Just finished recording new music with Mutya, Keisha and Siobhan, and the girls felt like having a bit of fun at the end of the last session – enjoy!!\". Lloyd and August Alsina have also released a remix of the song. In 2023, Tori Amos' cover of the track was included in Trevor Horn's album \"\"."

        "title": "Newbury &amp; Crookham Golf Club",
        "text": "Newbury &amp; Crookham Golf Club is located about two miles from the centre of Newbury, Berkshire on the fringes of Greenham Common. The Club is the result of an amalgamation in 1946 of two clubs: Crookham Golf Club, founded in 1873, and Newbury District Golf Club, founded in 1923.\nThe present course, as envisaged for the Newbury District Golf Club, was opened for play in 1923. It was designed and constructed by John H. Turner and James Sherlock. John H. Turner was formerly engaged at RMC Camberley, Thornock, Gainsborough, Flackwell Heath, Denham, and, by 1922, Frilford Heath. His contribution was by far the greater, being responsible for most of the design of the course. James Sherlock was first engaged as a professional at Oxford University before moving to Stoke Poges and, by 1922, to Hunstanton. His best performances in the Open Championship were 6th at Sandwich in 1904 and 8th at St Andrews in 1905. He was a frequent winner of professional tournaments.\nCrookham Golf Club was founded in 1873 at the initiative of Captain Robert Dashwood Fowler RN and the Rev. John Scott Ramsay who graduated MA from United College, St Andrews University in 1863 and took up a living in his first church at nearby St Paul's, Kingsclere Woodlands in 1872. During his time at St Andrews he evidently practiced \"the Golf\" so that, when he arrived in Kingsclere, he already had a reputation as a \"well known player from St Andrews\". The location of the Crookham Golf Club course was on Crookham Common adjacent to, and on the North side of the road from Newbury through Crookham. The first mention of Crookham Golf Club was in the Berkshire Chronicle on 3 May 1873 with a call to people interested in becoming members of the Club. They adopted a local hostelry, the Traveller's Friend, as their \"Clubhouse\".\nThere certainly seem to have been some holes of interest on the Crookham course. One of note was the 13th named The Avenue. The Avenue was a line of lime trees, still visible today on Greenham Common. Play to the green was over these trees. Horace Hutchinson, a noted golfer in his day, described it as “A short hole played over an avenue of tall trees. It was not a blind hole as you could just get a glimpse of the flag between the stems.” He went on to say that “Some of our course constructors might make a note of this hole; and might do worse than copy it. I should say that one of its kind a round is enough”. The length of the course direct between the holes was three miles one hundred yards, comprising 18 holes two of which were used going out and coming in.\nThe aforementioned Horace Huthchinson won the Open Challenge Cup, now known as the Newbury &amp; Crookham Medal, three times over the spring, autumn and spring of 1878/1879. His home club was the Royal North Devon, as the competition was an Open Challenge the best players of the day would come to compete for it.\nThe Crookham Handicap Challenge Cup, now known as the Newbury &amp; Crookham Bogey, was the equivalent of a monthly medal. The first winner in 1874 was C.S Cunliffe, an army man from Aldershot. One of the founders, the Rev. Ramsay, was a prolific winner, with seven victories between 1874 and 1876. Another prolific winner was Captain Cecil Lyon.\nThe development of golf at Crookham was a convenient venue for those wanting to play in Open Golf competitions as the course was situated close to Thatcham train station on the Great Western Railway, and midway between the other three golfing venues in the south of England, Westward Ho! (Royal North Devon), Blackheath, and Wimbledon. Club membership was mainly made up of landowners, masons, bankers, flourishing tradesmen and the clergy."

        "text": "Temple Golf Club is a golf club located in Hurley, Berkshire, England. It is about 2 miles northwest of Maidenhead. It was opened in 1910. The course was designed by Willie Park Jr. It is recognised for its scenic beauty and its emphasis on sustainable environmental management.\nLocation.\nThe Temple golf course is on the right bank of the River Thames near Hurley, Berkshire, and not far from Maidenhead.\nIt is on the edge of the Chiltern Hills, and is surrounded by beech woods.\nIn the 19th century the land occupied by the golf course was part of Temple Park, in which many specimen trees had been planted.\nThese were incorporated into the golf course layout.\nThe course covered about of the park.\nThe terrain consists of a series of ridges, which were exploited by the designers.\nCourse.\nA reviewer in 1920 wrote, \"It may fairly be asserted that very few English golf links possess the beauties of Temple as regards the surroundings. From the terrace of the Club House the eye takes in a green expanse of English pastural scenery which is bounded on the horizon by the bold, bluff outlines of the Chiltern Hills, and also takes in one of the most beautiful pieces of the Thames Valley by Marlow and Bisham.\"\nThe course is long, with par of 70.\nAccording to Henry Cotton, \"Temple is tricky to score on, simply because no green is set up for the golf shot, so the ball goes forward off the pitch if incorrectly flighted and over hit. The turf is superb at Temple and the fairway lies almost too good to be true.\"\nDonald Steel said the course is \"challenging enough to keep good players at full stretch without diminishing the enjoyment of the rank and file.\"\nIn 1999 Temple was the national winner of the British and International Golf Greenkeepers Association (BIGGA) Golf Environment Competition.\nAccording to BIGGA Judge Dr. Keith Duff, chief scientist at English Nature, \"Temple provides the elusive feel good factor (often intangibly) when you play a course which both challenges the skills of the golfer, and at the same time, inspires you with its setting.\nIn 2017 the club was a finalist for the BIGGA Greenkeeping Achievement of the Year award.\nHistory.\nThe Temple Golf Club was founded in 1909 by some local landowners and army officers, including Colonel F. C. Ricardo, said to be the inspiration for Mr. Toad in Kenneth Grahame's \"The Wind in the Willows\".\nThe course, originally called Temple Links, was designed by Willie Park and James Hepburn.\nIt opened on 4 May 1910.\nMaintenance in the early days was labour-intensive.\nThe grass was cut using sickles, scythes and horse drawn mowing machines.\nThe hillside was maintained by grazing sheep, and the hay was cut and baled by a local farmer.\nThe course was home to wildlife such as geese and ducks in the marsh areas, partridge and pheasant, hare and deer.\nIn the early days there were relatively few members, and the course was not used much in winter.\nThe fairways were very narrow, and there were many more bunkers than at present.\nThe golfing enthusiast Raymond Oppenheimer was active in management of the course, which was owned by his family.\nAt the age of 16 he was a scratch golfer at Temple.\nPlayers included Sam Snead, Lawson Little, Cyril Tolley, Bobby Locke, Peter Thomson, Joe Carr, Michael Bonallack and Henry Cotton.\nCotton later became the club's professional.\nRaymond Oppenheimer withdrew from management of the course in 1969.\nSince then the course has been managed by a Committee of the Green and a chairman.\nEnvironment.\nThe subsoil is chalky, which makes the course drier than most.\nIt does not suffer from mud and puddles during wet weather.\nHowever, a dry summer did not burn the natural bent and fescue grasses that dominated the turf when the course opened.\nIn the early 1970s the club installed a pop-up irrigation system.\nThe combination of lack of aeration, excessive watering and fertilization and intensive mowing made the greens lush and soft, but damaged the grass quality, with the original bent and fescue grasses pushed out by annual meadow grass.\nThe traditional hay meadows were destroyed, reducing the numbers of insects, butterflies, moths, birds and small mammals.\nThere was still significant ecological value in the original grasslands, but the cutting regime was suppressing its development.\nIn 1990 the club implemented changes in response to an ecological appraisal.\nThese included changes to cutting regimes in the grassland roughs, and thinning, restocking and understory regeneration in the woodlands.\nUnder the new regime, the roughs were cut twice each year, in spring and late summer.\nCuttings were removed to avoid build-up of nutrients and thus to encourage growth of wild flowers rather than weed grasses. \nSemi-roughs were cut between once a week and once every three weeks.\nBetween 1990 and 2007 the cost of fertilizer was cut in half and the cost of pesticides by almost three quarters.\nWater usage went down by two thirds.\nThe course as of 2011 consisted mainly of high-quality grassland but had large areas of mature semi-natural woodland, and long hedgerows.\nAll were managed to maintain their ecological quality.\nThe hay meadows cover about and support wildflowers, butterflies and birds.\nThey are lightly cut in spring and harvested in autumn.\nThe cut material is composted on site with other green waste, and the finished compost is applied to areas that have little or no topsoil.\nThe roughs and semi-roughs were studied in a report for the Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire Naturalist Trust and the Windsor and Maidenhead Wildlife Group.\nIt found more than 200 flowering plant species, including a colony of more than 200 green winged orchid plants which could justify scheduling as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.\nThe woodland margins contain helleborines, spurge laurel and wood spurge.\nThere was evidence that badgers had been foraging in the semi-roughs, and the woodland margins contained badger tracks and setts."

The Trophy for this was presented to The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, who continue to host the competition annually.\nThe original course was at Ascot Heath, in the middle of Ascot Racecourse. In 2000, the racecourse owners gave the club notice to vacate the land, and eventually a new location was found on the other side of the road in Sunninghill Park. The new clubhouse opened to members in December 2004 and was officially inaugurated in 2006 by the patron of the club, Prince Andrew, Duke of York. Golf continued on Ascot Heath until August 2005 when it moved to the new course."

        "title": "Ice Hockey in Harlem",
        "text": "Ice Hockey in Harlem (IHIH) is a nonprofit organization based in New York City, New York, that works to improve the social and academic well being of children from the Harlem community. Through active participation in ice hockey, IHIH student-athletes learn the fundamentals of the game, engage in an active lifestyle, and broaden their life experiences.\nSince 1987, thousands of boys and girls have taken part in the program and have grown into capable, responsible adults who continue to live, work and, in many cases, raise their own children in Harlem. Each season, Ice Hockey in Harlem looks to offer new athletic and educational opportunities for children in its community. IHIH uses the sport of hockey to engage students and improve their self-esteem, while also providing a safe after school alternative that keeps them from harm and improves their school attendance and grades.\nIce Hockey in Harlem is also a member program of the National Hockey League's Hockey Is For Everyone initiative and has enjoyed a long relationship with New York Rangers, dating back to its inception.\nHistory and growth.\nIce Hockey in Harlem began in the winter of 1987 with forty eager participants ranging in age from 9–12 years old. All participants agreed to attend weekly classroom sessions and skate one night a week. In class these Ice Hockey in Harlem pioneers were taught math, reading, and geography using hockey cities and statistics as teaching tools.\nWith a cursory knowledge of the basics, the youngsters donned mismatched, second-hand equipment and wobbled onto the ice of Lasker Rink, an outdoor facility at the northern end of Central Park. Under the tutelage of Co- Founders Dave Wilk and Todd Levy, and with the help of former New York Ranger Pat Hickey, the boys were soon skating, shooting, and passing as though they had been playing the game for years. After that rookie season, the program managed to raise enough money to send one player to a summer hockey camp in California.\nBy Year Five, Ice Hockey in Harlem had expanded to 125 kids. With this increase in enrollment, IHIH was on the ice at Lasker Rink three nights a week for clinics, a six-team intramural league, and an All-Star touring team. The New York Rangers were generously supporting the program with a mid-season clinic at Lasker and fund-raising efforts. That summer players went off to summer hockey camp, in Canada and the U.S. Two players graduated from the program to attend prep schools on IHIH scholarships.\nBefore the start of Year Seven, the Ice Hockey in Harlem Board of Directors decided that expansion of the program and the increase in participants exceeded the capabilities of an all-volunteer staff. The full-time staff includes a Hockey Director and an Events Manager.\nToday.\nNow in its third decade, Ice Hockey in Harlem has become a widely recognized and highly respected name throughout the hockey community. It has also served as the model for numerous successful programs throughout the country. For nearly two decades now, Ice Hockey in Harlem has helped thousands of needy youngsters learn a sport that would otherwise be financially unavailable to them. More importantly, through its educational and community service components, IHIH has given its participants the tools to succeed in their schools and as solid citizens in their communities.\nHockey programs.\nOn-Ice Programming takes place three nights per week and Saturdays at Lasker Rink in Northern Central Park. Students normally spend a minimum of one and a half hours on ice each week. The hockey program is broken out into an introductory hockey program for beginners and advanced sessions by age groups as approved by USA Hockey.\nThe Learn to Skate/Learn to Play program is for children between the ages of 4-12 who are just getting started. They are provided with hockey equipment and ice skates and begin the process of getting comfortable on the ice and learning the rules of the game. This is where they begin to build confidence and an appreciation for the game and their coaches.\nAge specific on ice activities are for students from 4–18 years old include skills development sessions and game setting scrimmages. Eventually students take part in intramural scrimmages to begin gaining in-game experience and then home and travel exhibition games against teams from the local New York City and Westchester community, New Jersey and Connecticut.\nEducational programs.\nThese programs focus on academic achievement and character development for students between the age of 9-13. Through educational programming, participants are given the opportunity to develop their academic skills, and by doing so, demonstrate Ice Hockey in Harlem’s motto: “Education is our Goal.” Students are required to attend weekly classroom sessions as a condition for participation in the hockey program.\nThe IHIH after school curriculum teaches geography, history, and social studies, and skills in math, reading, and writing, using hockey as the central reference for study. This includes hockey literature, cities, statistics, players, rules of play, etc. IHIH has made literacy a focus of its educational programming.\nFour years ago, 'Book Club' was created for participants ages 9-16 to enhance their reading skills and promote a love of reading. This year, students read “The Game of their Lives” by Peter Gwozski about the 1980-81 Edmonton Oilers.\nBenefit On The Green.\nFor over 20 years, Ice Hockey in Harlem has hosted their annual Benefit on the Green Golf Tournament. This annual BOTG golf, and now, tennis outing brings together past and present NHL stars along with top corporate and private sponsors for a day that includes 18 rounds of golf, a tennis tournament, a cocktail reception, awards dinner, and live sports auction. Over the years, they have had such NHL players as Mark Messier, Mike Richter, Brad Richards, Brian Leetch, Willie O’Ree, Rod Gilbert, Martin St. Louis, Stephane Matteau, Jeff Beukeboom, and Manny Malhotra, among others. Through the BOTG, Ice Hockey in Harlem has raised much needed funding for programs to help ensure every student has a meaningful experience on and off the ice. Celebrating its 25th anniversary, Ice Hockey in Harlem will be hosting this year’s BOTG at the Quaker Ridge Golf Club in Scarsdale, NY.\nWinter Sports Celebration.\nEach year, Ice Hockey in Harlem and the New York Rangers team up to co-host the Winter Sports Auction. IHIH’s Winter Sports Auction brings together kids from the program, friends, and members of the New York Rangers and Rangers alumni for an evening of fun and auction shopping in support of the kids. The event normally consists of a live sport memorabilia auction, silent auction, and raffle while allowing fans to mingle and collect autographs from current and former New York Rangers."

Each nation was limited to one competitor. The distance was 1 kilometre. The race was won by the Danish rider Willy Hansen in 1 minutes, 14.4 seconds. Gerard Bosch van Drakestein of the Netherlands took silver, while Dunc Gray of Australia earned bronze. It was the first medal for each of the three nations in the men's track time trial; none had competed in 1896.\nBackground.\nThis was the second appearance of the event, which had previously been held in 1896. It would be held every Games until being dropped from the programme after 2004. The event was a \"new event\" in track cycling, \"supposedly popular in Italy.\"\nTwelve of the 16 competing nations made their debut in the event: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Denmark, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and Turkey. The four returning nations were Austria, France, Germany, and Great Britain.\nCompetition format.\nThe event was a time trial on the track, with each cyclist competing separately to attempt to achieve the fastest time. Unlike in 1896, the competition used a standing start. The distance was also increased to one kilometre rather than the one-third of a kilometre used previously.\nRecords.\nThere were no standing world or Olympic records prior to the 1928 Summer Olympics; world records were not ratified by the UCI until 1949 and the event (at the 1 kilometre distance) had not previously been held at the Olympics.\nOctave Dayen went first, earning a de facto Olympic record at 1:16.0. Gerard Bosch van Drakestein was the first man to beat Dayen, recording a time of 1:15.2. This held until Willy Hansen, racing 14th of 16, achieved a 1:14.4 time.\nResults.\nThe Official Report omits Rodríguez and Cattaneo, but other sources demonstrate that the two men did compete.\nNotes.\nDe Wael lists 16 competitors, with Francisco Rodríguez of Argentina placing 8th and Angelo Cattaneo of Italy tying with Aerts for 9th (with other finishers moving down correspondingly). Their names were not on the 1928 Official Report, but were discovered via research on Dutch newspapers from the time."

        "text": "Great Britain's Andy Murray defeated Switzerland's Roger Federer in the final, 6–2, 6–1, 6–4 to win the gold medal in men's singles tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics. The final was a rematch of the Wimbledon final played at the same venue four weeks prior, in which Federer prevailed. Federer was attempting to become the third man to complete the career Golden Slam in singles (after Andre Agassi and Rafael Nadal). It was Federer's third consecutive Olympics as the singles world No. 1, but his silver finish remains his only Olympic medal in singles. In the bronze medal match, Argentina's Juan Martín del Potro defeated Serbia's Novak Djokovic, 7–5, 6–4. Murray's gold was Great Britain's first medal at the event since 1908, and the nation's record fourth overall. Federer's silver was Switzerland's first medal at the event since 1992. Del Potro's bronze was Argentina's first medal at the event overall.\nThe tournament was held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London from 28 July to 5 August, making it the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was re-introduced to the Games. The event was run and organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and was part of the Association of Tennis Professionals tour. Matches were the best-of-three sets, except for the final which was the best-of-five sets. Tie-breaks were in use for all sets except the fifth set of the final and the third set of all other matches. There were 64 players from 34 nations.\nRafael Nadal was the reigning gold medalist from 2008, but withdrew due to a recurring knee injury. Despite his early exit at Wimbledon the previous month, Nadal was the pre-Olympics favourite to retain his Gold Medal.\nThe second-round match between Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Milos Raonic lasted 3 hours and 57 minutes and 66 games, with the third set ending at 25–23. This was (then) the longest tennis match in Olympic history, in terms of games played and in time, under the best-of-three-sets system. However, this record was quickly eclipsed by Federer and del Potro three days later in a semifinal encounter that lasted 4 hours 26 minutes, with the third set ending at 19–17. This was both the longest singles tennis match in Olympic history (played with the best-of-three-sets format) and the longest such match in the Open Era, surpassing the 4 hours 3 minutes in Nadal's victory over Djokovic at the 2009 Madrid Masters.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th (medal) appearance of the men's singles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. Demonstration events were held in 1968 and 1984.\nThe number one seed was Roger Federer of Switzerland, making his fourth Olympic appearance and second as the top seed. Reigning champion Rafael Nadal of Spain was out with a knee injury, though Spain was still represented among the top-four seeds with David Ferrer. Serb Novak Djokovic and Briton Andy Murray made up the rest of the top seeds. Djokovic had taken bronze in 2008; the other two quarterfinalists from that tournament to return were Federer and Jürgen Melzer of Austria.\nBulgaria, Colombia, Kazakhstan, Slovenia, Tunisia, and Ukraine each made their debut in the event. France made its 13th appearance, most among all nations, having missed only the 1904 event.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's singles was primarily through the ATP ranking list of 11 June 2012. An additional restriction was that players had to have been available for two Davis Cup events between 2009 and 2012. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. There were 64 quota places available for men's singles. The first 56 were assigned through the world ranking. There were two Tripartite Commission invitation places and 6 final qualification places allocated by the ITF based on continental and national representation along with world rankings.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were in best-of-3 sets, except for the final which was in best-of-5 sets. No tiebreak was played in the final set.\nSchedule.\nThe tournament ran from 28 July and 5 August."

Both finalists were attempting to become the second woman (after Steffi Graf) to complete the career Golden Slam in singles. Williams won the gold, only weeks after winning the 2012 Wimbledon Championships, without losing a set, without losing more than three games in any set, and without losing more than five games in any match. Her serve was broken only once during the tournament (by Urszula Radwańska in the second round). She also became the first tennis player (male or female) to complete the career Golden Slam in both singles and doubles. It was the United States' first victory in the event since Serena's sister Venus Williams won in 2000, and its fifth gold overall. In the bronze medal match, Belarus' Victoria Azarenka defeated Russia's Maria Kirilenko, 6–3, 6–4.\nThe tournament was held at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London from 28 July to 4 August 2012, and was the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was re-introduced to the Games. There were 64 competitors from 33 nations.\nElena Dementieva was the reigning gold medallist, having won in 2008, but she retired from the sport in 2010.\nBackground.\nThis was the 12th appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nReturning from the 2008 Games were bronze medalist Vera Zvonareva of Russia, fourth-place finisher Li Na of China, and three quarterfinalists: Jelena Janković of Serbia and the Williams sisters, Venus and Serena. Venus was the 2000 Olympic champion, playing in her fourth Olympic singles tournament. Serena had won almost every tennis honor possible except the Olympic singles (the sisters had won women's doubles in 2000 and 2008, and would win again in London). The Russian team that swept the medals four years earlier had experienced nearly complete turnover; gold medalist Elena Dementieva had retired, silver medalist Dinara Safina was injured, and Svetlana Kuznetsova was slumping. This made room for Maria Sharapova, a major rival of Serena. Sharapova and Serena were seeded #3 and #4 behind world #1 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and #2 Agnieszka Radwańska of Poland.\nGeorgia, Kazakhstan, and Liechtenstein each made their debut in the event. France made its 11th appearance, most among nations to that point, having missed only the 1908 Games in London (when only British players competed).\nQualification.\nQualification for the women's singles was primarily through the WTA ranking list of 11 June 2012. An additional restriction was that players had to have been available for two Billie Jean King Cup events between 2009 and 2012. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. There were 64 quota places available for women's singles. The first 56 were assigned through the world ranking.

        "text": "LaCrosse Footwear, Inc. is an American company based in Portland, Oregon. Founded in 1897 in La Crosse, Wisconsin, the footwear company moved to Oregon in 2001 where its Danner Boots subsidiary was based. In 2012, the company, which previously had been publicly traded, was bought by Japanese-based ABC-Mart.\nThe company manufactures boots and other footwear primarily for use in agriculture, hunting, construction, and the outdoors. Other products include rubber boots for farm and hunting, all manufactured in Asia.\nHistory.\nLaCrosse was established in Wisconsin in 1897 as the La Crosse Rubber Mill in the city of La Crosse. The company became the largest employer in that city in 1930. In 1994, the company acquired Portland, Oregon-based Danner Boots in a merger that was expected to create a company with an annual revenue of $100 million. A month later the company announced plans for an initial public offering (IPO) worth up to $24 million in order to help purchase Danner. At the time, LaCrosse had annual sales of $82 million.\nThe IPO went ahead in April 1994, raising nearly $18 million with a stock symbol of BOOT. LaCrosse bought footwear maker Lake of the Woods in June 1997 for $6.5 million. Company revenues had grown to $138 million for fiscal year 2000. The company closed its US-based manufacturing for the namesake brand in July 2001, and later that year moved its headquarters to Portland in order to consolidate operations and take advantage of the concentration of shoe companies in the Portland metropolitan area. Later that year, it also reported the first quarterly profit since 1999. In 2010, LaCrosse opened a new factory in Portland for its Danner brand, which helped it earn a contract with the U.S. Department of Defense in September 2011 for making boots for the Marine Corps.\nIn July 2012, ABC-Mart (Japanese: エービーシー・マート) purchased LaCrosse for $20 per share. ABC-Mart, a Tokyo-based retailer, had approximately 800 stores in Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. LaCrosse hoped to use those distribution channels to expand their brand in Japan where the company's American made boots were popular. At the time of the announcement, LaCrosse had 300 employees in Portland, and no layoffs were expected. The deal was finalized in August, with LaCrosse then becoming a private subsidiary of ABC-Mart/Japan. President and CEO Joseph Schneider then left the company in September 2012."

        "text": "The 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the eighth edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the premier international beach soccer competition for men's national teams, which has been organized by FIFA since 2005. Overall, this was the 18th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995 to 2004 but was not governed by FIFA. It was also the third edition to take place under the biennial system introduced in 2009.\nThe tournament took place from 9 to 19 July 2015 at Praia da Baía in Espinho, Portugal, after the country's bid was selected by the FIFA Executive Committee on 28 May 2013, from among twelve proposals. This was the second time that Portugal hosted a FIFA competition, after the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship. Fifteen teams advanced through their respective continental qualification competitions to join the host team in the final tournament. The final draw occurred on 28 April 2015 at the Espinho Multimedia Auditorium, setting up a total of 32 matches that were played at the Espinho Stadium – a purpose-built temporary venue with a capacity of 3,500 – and attended by a total of 96,300 people.\nAfter missing the previous edition, Portugal reached the final – eliminating two-time defending champions Russia in the semi-finals – and defeated first-time finalists Tahiti 5–3 to claim their second world title and their first in the FIFA era. Alan and Madjer were the only two surviving players from the Portuguese squad that won their previous world title in 2001 to also win these championships.\nHost selection.\nTwelve FIFA member associations from five confederations officially announced their interest in hosting the 2015 Beach Soccer World Cup by the deadline of 14 September 2012. On 28 May 2013, the FIFA Executive Committee, gathered in Mauritius, announced that the tournament would be held in Portugal. It was the second time that Portugal staged a FIFA competition, after the 1991 FIFA World Youth Championship.\nQualification.\nQualifying rounds took place in 2014 and 2015. Portugal qualified automatically as hosts.\nAfrican Zone.\nThe CAF Beach Soccer Championship took place in Roche Caiman, Seychelles on 14–19 April 2015. A total of eight teams took part in the tournament, where seven spots (other than host nation Seychelles) were determined through qualifiers held in February and March 2015. The top two teams qualified for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Senegal and Madagascar won their respective semi-finals on 18 April 2015 to qualify for the World Cup, with Madagascar defeating Senegal in the final on the next day to win the tournament.\nAsian Zone.\nThe AFC Beach Soccer Championship took place in Doha, Qatar on 23–28 March 2015. A total of 14 teams took part in the tournament (Palestine entered but withdrew). The top three teams qualified for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Oman and Japan won their respective semi-finals on 27 March 2015 to qualify for the World Cup. On the next day, Iran won the third place match to also book a place in the World Cup, while Oman defeated Japan in the final to win the tournament.\nEuropean Zone.\nThe UEFA qualifiers took place in Jesolo, Italy on 5–14 September 2014. A total of 23 teams took part in the tournament (Georgia entered but withdrew). The top four teams qualified for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Switzerland became the first team (other than host nation Portugal) to qualify for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup on 11 September 2014. On the next day, Russia, Spain and Italy also booked a place in the World Cup by advancing to the semi-finals, with Russia defeating Switzerland in the final two days later to win the tournament, and Italy defeating Spain to finish third.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean Zone.\nThe CONCACAF Beach Soccer Championship took place in Costa del Sol, El Salvador on 28 March–4 April 2015. A total of 16 teams took part in the tournament. The top two teams qualified for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Mexico and Costa Rica won their respective semi-finals on 3 April 2015 to qualify for the World Cup, with Mexico defeating Costa Rica in the final on the next day to win the tournament.\nOceanian Zone.\nThe OFC Beach Soccer Championship was scheduled to take place in Tahiti on 16–22 February 2015. However, the tournament was cancelled, and Tahiti were designated by the OFC as their representative.\nSouth American Zone.\nThe CONMEBOL Beach Soccer Championship took place in Manta, Ecuador on 19–26 April 2015. A total of 10 teams took part in the tournament. The top three teams qualified for the 2015 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup. Brazil and Paraguay won their respective semi-finals on 25 April 2015 to qualify for the World Cup. On the next day, Argentina won the third place match to also book a place in the World Cup, while Brazil defeated Paraguay in the final to win the tournament.\nTeams.\nThe following 16 teams qualified for the final tournament:\nNotes:\nVenue.\nAll matches were played at the \"Espinho Stadium\", a purpose-built 3,500-capacity venue located in Praia da Baía, Espinho. \nReferees.\nFIFA chose 24 officials from 24 different countries to referee matches at the World Cup, with at least one referee representing each confederation: four from AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from OFC and eight from UEFA.\nDraw.\nThe final draw was held on 28 April 2015 at the Espinho Multimedia Auditorium. The 16 teams were drawn into four groups of four teams, with hosts Portugal being seeded in Group A and defending champions Russia being seeded in Group D. Switzerland and Brazil, the second and third-ranked teams in the FIFA World Ranking, were the other two seeded teams. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn against each other for the group stage, except one of the groups that must contain two UEFA teams as there were five UEFA teams.\nSquads.\nEach team must name a squad of 12 players (two of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. The squads were officially announced by FIFA on 2 July 2015.\nGroup stage.\nIn the group stage, teams earn three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat.\nFollowing FIFA's rule changes issued in July 2014, this was the first World Cup to award just one point for a penalty shoot-out win (as opposed to two points in all previous World Cups) as well as penalty shoots outs being best of three rather than sudden death from the start.\nAll times are in WEST ().\nTiebreaking.\nThe ranking of each team in each group will be determined by the following criteria:\nIf two or more teams are equal on the basis of the above criterion, their rankings will be determined as follows:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAwards.\nIn the aftermath of the final, FIFA presented individual awards to the three best players of the tournament, top goal-scorers, and to the best goalkeeper. In addition, a collective award was given to the team with the most points in the Fair Play ranking. Since three players all scored 8 goals, other stats such as assists, penalties and matches played were then considered to work out the standings between them. Notably, this World Cup saw the fewest goals ever scored for a player to claim the golden boot."

        "text": "The United States' Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan defeated France's Michaël Llodra and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the final, 6–4, 7–6(7–2) to win the gold medal in Men's Doubles tennis at the 2012 Summer Olympics. This completed a career Golden Slam for the Bryan brothers, making them the second men's doubles team to do so (after The Woodies of Australia; Canada's Daniel Nestor also won a career Golden Slam, but with multiple partners). Their victory marked the first instance that both Olympic tennis doubles titles were claimed by siblings; fellow Americans Serena and Venus Williams won the women's doubles title. It was the record fourth gold medal for the United States in men's doubles. In the bronze-medal match, France's Julien Benneteau and Richard Gasquet defeated Spain's David Ferrer and Feliciano López, 7–6(7–4), 6–2. With France's silver and bronze, this was the first time since 1924 that one nation won multiple medals in the men's doubles.\nThe tournament was held at the All England Club in Wimbledon, London from 28 July to 4 August, making it the first Olympic grass court tournament since tennis was re-introduced to the Games. The event was run and organised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and was part of the Association of Tennis Professionals tour. Matches were the best-of-three sets, and tie-breaks were in use for all sets except the third set. There were 32 teams from 25 countries.\nSwitzerland's Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka were the reigning gold medalists from 2008, but they lost in the second round to Israel's Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of men's doubles tennis. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. A demonstration event was held in 1968.\nThe American pair of Bryan brothers, Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan, had been the top seed in 2004 but exited in the quarterfinals. They were again the number one seed in Beijing, but were defeated in the semifinals and took bronze. For a third Games, they were the top seed. Defending champions Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka also returned. One of the French fourth-place team members, Michaël Llodra, also competed again, this time paired with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. 2000 gold medalist Daniel Nestor (and career golden slam winner) of Canada competed for a fourth Games with his third different partner.\nColombia made its debut in the event. France and Great Britain each made their 11th appearance in the event, tied for most of all nations.\nQualification.\nQualification for the men's doubles was primarily through the ATP ranking list of 11 June 2012. An additional restriction was that players had to have been available for two Davis Cup events between 2009 and 2012. Nations had been able to enter four players (two pairs) in the event since the 2004 Games. Each nation was limited to a total of 6 male players in the singles and doubles events combined, so nations with 4 singles players could add only 2 more in doubles. The men's doubles draw was 32 pairs (64 players), with most of the pairs coming from the singles event where nations had 2 or 4 players. Doubles players ranked 10 or better qualified directly and could bring any ranked singles or doubles player from their nation as their partner. The ITF allocated places based on ranking and continental and national representation (bringing the total number of male tennis players to 86).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets; the final was reduced from best-of-five in prior Games. Tiebreaks were used for any set before the third (fifth in the final) that reached 6–6.\nReferences.\nMen's Doubles Draw"

The ground is used by Chester Boughton Hall Cricket Club.\nHistory.\nThe first recorded match held on the ground was in 1886, when Boughton Hall played Huyton. Cheshire first used the ground in 1910 when they played Northumberland in the Minor Counties Championship. Prior to and after World War I, Cheshire played a match annually at the ground, until World War II. Following the war Cheshire returned to the ground in 1951, however this would be their last match there until 1970. In 1972, the ground was selected as a home venue for Minor Counties North in the 1972 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, where the team played a single List A match against Lancashire. From 1970 to 1988, the ground held one Minor Counties Championship match annually.\nCheshire played their first List A match at the venue in the first round of the 1988 NatWest Trophy, which saw them record a famous victory against first-class opponents Northamptonshire. However, Cheshire lost their second round match held at Boughton Hall against Derbyshire. The following season, Cheshire played a further List A match there against Hampshire in the 1989 NatWest Trophy, which ended in defeat. Cheshire played their first MCCA Knockout Trophy match there in 1992 against Northumberland, with Minor Counties Championship cricket returning there in 1993 when Dorset visited the ground. List A cricket returned to the ground in the 1995 NatWest Trophy when Essex defeated Cheshire, while in the 1998 NatWest Trophy the same opponents visited, with Essex once again triumphing. The ground was used infrequently by Cheshire in minor counties during the 1990s.\nCheshire's first match there in the 21st century came against Lincolnshire in a List A match in the 2000 NatWest Trophy, which Lincolnshire won. The ground held its final List A match in first round of the 2002 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy when Cheshire played the Lancashire Cricket Board, with the match held in 2001 to avoid fixture congestion in 2002. Cheshire won by 8 wickets. Cheshire played a total of seven List A matches at the ground, winning two and losing five. Minor counties cricket returned in 2003, with Cheshire playing a single Minor Counties Championship match annually since then. Three MCCA Knockout Trophy matches have been played there since 2007, all with Devon as the opposition."

In the bronze medal match, the United States' Lisa Raymond and Mike Bryan defeated Germany's Sabine Lisicki and Christopher Kas, 6–3, 4–6, [10–4].\nThe tournament was held from 1 to 5 August on the grass courts of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in Wimbledon, London. This was the first time mixed doubles was included in the Olympic tennis programme since Paris in 1924, where Hazel Wightman and Richard Williams won gold. 32 players (16 pairs) from 13 nations competed.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of mixed doubles tennis. The event was first held in 1900 and would not be held again until 1912 (when both outdoor and indoor versions were held); it would then be held the next two Games in 1920 and 1924. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 (which included mixed doubles) and 1984 (which did not). Mixed doubles did not return with the rest of the tennis programme in 1988; instead, it was not until 2012 that mixed doubles returned to the programme, where it has been since.\nBelarus's Max Mirnyi was a top doubles specialist with six Grand Slam titles but no Olympic medals, as the country had no other top level male doubles player and the mixed doubles had not been played at the Olympics since 1924. Victoria Azarenka was the world #1 women's singles player with strong experience in doubles. The pair had won the 2007 US Open – Mixed doubles together and were the top seeds coming into the return of the event at the 2012 Olympics. The other seeded teams were the two American pairs (with the Bryan brothers playing with Liezel Huber and Lisa Raymond) and Polish duo Agnieszka Radwańska and Marcin Matkowski.\nArgentina, Australia, Belarus, the Czech Republic, Poland, Russia, and Serbia each made their mixed doubles debut. Great Britain and Sweden each competed for the fourth time, matching the absent France for most appearances among nations.\nQualification.\nThe main qualifying criteria were the ATP and WTA ranking lists as of 11 June 2012. The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. Players must have also made themselves available for two Fed/Davis Cup events from 2009 to 2012, one of which must have taken place in 2011–2012, and had a good standing with their National Olympic Committee.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter up to six men and six women athletes, with a maximum of four entries in the individual events, and two pairs in the doubles events. Any player in the world's top 56 was eligible, and NOCs had the option to enter players of a lower rank. Athletes were able to compete in both singles and doubles events. Doubles players within the top 10 doubles rankings on 11 June were eligible to bring any player provided that player had any doubles or singles ranking, and as long as the number of players from the same country did not surpass the total of six.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets. Tie-breaks were used for the first two sets of each match. If the score was tied at one set all, a 'super tie-break' (the first pairing to win at least 10 points by a margin of two points) would be used.\nSchedule.\nMatches took place between 1 and 5 August."

These followed the same format as those in the men's Giro d'Italia, and as in the men's race, the leader of the general classification received a pink jersey. This classification was calculated by adding the combined finishing times of the riders from each stage, and the overall winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Giro.\nThe other jerseys differ in colour from those of the men's Giro:\nFinal standings.\nGeneral classification.\nSource:\nFurther reading.\nIn November 2013 a book named \"Strijd in het vrouwenpeloton: de Giro door de ogen van Marianne Vos en Ellen van Dijk\" was published.

        "text": "Graeme Smith is a retired South African cricketer who played international cricket between 2002 and 2014. In a career spanning 12 years, he made centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 27 and 10 occasions in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches respectively. His tally of 37 international centuries places him only behind Jacques Kallis (62), Hashim Amla (53) and AB de Villiers (45) among his countrymen, as of October 2016.\nSmith made his Test and ODI debuts against Australia during the 2001–02 home series. His maiden century—200 against Bangladesh—came in October 2002. During South Africa's tour of England in 2003, he scored double centuries—277 at Edgbaston and 259 at Lord's—in consecutive Tests. Smith's performances in the season led to him being named one of the five \"Wisden\" Cricketers of the Year in 2004. His three centuries in consecutive Tests were instrumental in ensuring South Africa's series win against the West Indies in 2005. In Tests, Smith made centuries against all teams except India and Sri Lanka. He was most successful against England with seven centuries. With five double centuries he leads the list among South African cricketers as of May 2014. As of October 2015, Smith's four centuries in the fourth innings of a Test match is the second highest by any player, only behind Younus Khan, who has scored five centuries in the fourth innings of a Test. Of his 27 Test centuries, 25 came while captaining the side, and South Africa lost none of its matches on any such instance.\nSmith's first ODI century came in 2005, three years after his international debut. He went on to score four more centuries the same year, the second-most in a calendar year by a South African. Smith's highest score in ODIs was 141, which he made against England in September 2009. In ODIs, he made centuries against eight different opponents, with three of them scored at venues outside South Africa. Between his debut Twenty20 International and final one in 2005, Smith played 33 matches in the format without scoring a century; his highest score of 89 not out was made against Australia in February 2006."

        "text": "The Rugby Europe Sevens are a series of rugby sevens tournaments held by Rugby Europe. It was formerly known as the FIRA-AER Sevens until 2013, and the Sevens Grand Prix Series until 2021. Only one annual tournament existed prior to 2011, when Rugby Europe created a series of tournaments, following the model of the World Rugby Sevens Series. The main division is known as the Rugby Europe Championship Series, formerly known the Grand Prix, followed by the Trophy Series, Conference 1, and Conference 2. The competitions use a promotion/relegation system.\nFormat.\nIn the Championship Series, twelve teams play in at least two tournaments each summer throughout Europe. Each tournament spans two to three days — the first day is a pool phase, the second day is a pool and knockout phase, and the third day a knockout phase. During the pool phase, the teams are divided into three pools of four teams each. After the pool phase, the top eight teams (two first of each pool, plus two best-performing third place teams) advance to the Cup tournament; the other four teams play for the Challenge Trophy.\nAt the end of each tournament, teams are awarded points based on their performance. At the end of the series, the team with the most points is declared the champion. The team with the fewest points is relegated from the Championship Series to the Trophy competition, whereas the champion of the Trophy competition is promoted to next season's Championship Series.\nHistory.\n2002–2010.\nA number of qualifying tournaments lead up to a finals tournament, which functions as the European championship and, in 2008, also as the qualifying stage for the Sevens World Cup.\nPortugal won the first European Championship held in Heidelberg in 2002. Portugal would go onto win eight out of the first ten tournaments. In 2003, Heidelberg again held the tournament. In 2004 Palma de Mallorca was the host. From 2005 to 2007, Moscow hosted the tournament. Hanover held the tournament for the first time in 2008 and did so again in 2009. In 2010, the tournament returned to Moscow.\n2011–present.\nIn 2011, the format of the competition changed. The twelve best teams now meet over the course of several tournaments, following the model of the IRB Sevens World Series. The name also changed from the European Championship to the Sevens Grand Prix Series. The first edition of this competition was held in 2011 and won by Portugal. In 2021 the competition changed its name from the Sevens Grand Prix to the Rugby Europe Sevens Championship Series."

On 13 July 2020, Simonović signed a two-year deal with former team Crvena zvezda. On 15 November 2020, Simonović recorded his 300 apperiences for the Zvezda. He retired as a player with Crvena zvezda in July 2022. \nNational team career.\nSimonović was a member of the senior Serbian national basketball team which took silver medal at the 2014 World Cup under head coach Aleksandar Đorđević and after that he was a part of Olympic team that took silver medal at the 19th Olympic Basketball Tournament at the 2016 Summer Olympics under the head coach Aleksandar Đorđević.\nHe also represented Serbia at the EuroBasket 2015. In the first phase of the tournament, Serbia dominated in the toughest Group B with 5-0 record, and then eliminated Finland and Czech Republic in the round of 16 and quarterfinal game, respectively. However, they were stopped in the semifinal game by Lithuania with 67–64, and eventually lost to the host team France in the bronze-medal game with 81–68. Simonović was mostly used as a three-point and defensive task specialist; he averaged 2.3 points and 2.0 rebounds per game on 30.8% shooting from the three-point line.\nSimonović also represented Serbia at the 2016 Summer Olympics where they won the silver medal, after losing to the United States in the final game with 96–66.\nAt the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the national team of Serbia was dubbed as favorite to win the trophy, but was eventually upset in the quarterfinals by Argentina.

On 19 November 2022, the club parted ways with his following the Jovanović departure.\nOn 18 December 2023, SPD Radnički hired Simonović as their new head coach.\nControversy.\n2014 Serbian League trophy incident.\nOn 21 June 2014, Crvena zvezda team captain Simonović was part of a bizarre incident following the Serbian League playoffs final game 4, a hard-fought overtime contest that saw Partizan defeat arch-rivals Red Star Belgrade for a 13th consecutive league title.\nThe home-court loss came as a bitter pill to the Red Star team, considered by significant sections of the Serbian media and fans as title favorites capable of finally ending Partizan's 12-year domestic league domination. However, Partizan, already up 2-1 in the best-of-five series, led by Bogdan Bogdanović's 36 point performance, managed a memorable overtime away win for its 13th consecutive Serbian title.\nDisappointed and embittered over yet another failure to win the Serbian League, members of the Red Star ultra fan group, Delije, decided to disrupt the championship trophy presentation by storming the court, grabbing the displayed trophy, and taking it back with them into the stands among a crowd of fellow ultra fans. Simonović was soon seen entering the said crowd of Red Star fans by climbing into the stands where he proceeded to lift up the seized trophy, an act met with loud approval from the gathered fans who immediately erupted into cheers and fan songs. Many others in the arena expressed visible disapproval, among them seemingly even some Red Star players who turned away and began walking off the court.\nSince the trophy was physically damaged in the process, the championship trophy ceremony was eventually held with a smaller replica trophy presented to Partizan players and staff. Simonović later denied trying to offend anyone with his actions, claiming he entered the stands after being asked by the game's delegate to do so and try to return the trophy on the court."

        "title": "2012 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby",
        "text": "The 2012 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship as the State Farm Home Run Derby) was a home run hitting contest in Major League Baseball (MLB) between four batters each from the American League and National League. The derby was held on July 9, 2012, at the site of the 2012 MLB All-Star Game, Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.\nPrince Fielder won the derby with five home runs in the first round, eleven home runs in the second round, and twelve runs in the finals. His twelve home runs in the final round ties Robinson Canó's record for final round home runs, set in 2011. Fielder beat Toronto outfielder José Bautista in the final round, 12–7.\nRules.\nEach participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch without penalty. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he records ten outs in each round. When nine outs are reached in each round, the \"gold money ball\" comes into play, in which State Farm donates a certain amount of money to charities if a home run is hit. This repeats until the batter records the final out.\nIn the first two rounds, home run totals will carry over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a \"swing-off\" takes place. In a swing-off, each tied player gets five swings to hit as many home runs as possible. If after the five swings a tie still remains, players get three more swings to determine the winner; if needed, sudden-death swings continue until one player homers. Home runs hit during a first round swing-off do not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participate in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi-finals. The players with top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores reset from the first two rounds.\nRobinson Canó booing controversy.\nYankees' second baseman Robinson Canó was at the center of a controversy involving booing from the live Kauffman Stadium fans. Canó was the American League's captain for the Home Run Derby and was responsible for picking the other participants. In June, Canó said that the right thing to do would be to choose a player from the hosting Kansas City Royals. However, he ultimately picked Prince Fielder, José Bautista, and Mark Trumbo (who finished in first, second, and third place respectively) as the AL representatives, leaving out Billy Butler of the Royals. The fans in attendance at the Derby expressed their displeasure at the snub, and heavily jeered Canó with booing during his performance at the derby. Canó did not hit a single home run during the derby and finished in last place. Later, Canó claimed that Kansas City fans targeted his family during their jeers at the All-Star festivities."

If none of the top four finishers accepts the offer, this position in the starting gate reverts to qualifiers on the regular Road to the Kentucky Derby. Starting in 2018, Churchill Downs developed a similar European Road to the Kentucky Derby.\nThe remaining 18 spots in the starting gate (or up 20 if the European and Japanese offers are declined) are offered to the top finishers on the main Road to the Kentucky Derby. If one of those horses does not enter the Derby, their position is given to the next ranked horses on the list. Up to 24 horses may enter the race, with the bottom four point-earners listed as \"also eligible\". If any of the top 20 is scratched after entries are taken but before betting begins, the next ranked horse on the also eligible list will be eligible to run.\nIf two or more horses have the same number of points, the tiebreaker to get into the Kentucky Derby will be earnings in non-restricted stakes races, whether or not they are graded. In the event of a tie, those horses will divide equally the points they would have received jointly had one beaten the other. If an owner wants to run a filly in the Derby, she will have to earn points in the same races as the colts and geldings – points earned of the Road to the Kentucky Oaks are not transferable to the Derby.\nHistory.\nThe \"Road to the Kentucky Derby\" point system was created in 2012 to establish a \"clear, practical and understandable path\" to the first leg of horse racing's Triple Crown, according to the official website of Churchill Downs. A poll conducted by Churchill Downs prior to the changes showed 83% of respondents did not understand how horses became starters for the Kentucky Derby. The previous system was based on earnings from all graded stakes races, which essentially gave equal weight to earnings from juvenile races, sprints and even races on the turf as to the traditional Derby prep races. The new system completely disregards sprint races, and places heavy weight on later races, thus putting a premium on recent results. The points system has changed the way horses are prepared for the Derby, the composition of the field and how the race itself is run given the absence of pure sprinters to ensure a fast early pace.\nThe series is divided into two phases, the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and the Kentucky Derby Championship Series. The prep season consists of early races on dirt or synthetic surfaces over distances of at least one mile that typically are run between late September and late February. Points are awarded to the top 4 finishers in each race on a 10-4-2-1 scale, except for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, which has been awarded points on a 20-8-4-2 scale since 2016. The championship season consists of two legs and a \"wild card\" round. The first leg includes minor prep races, usually Grade II, with a 50-20-10-5 scale. The second leg consists of the Super Six Prep races, each worth 100 points to the winner. They include such historic races as the Florida Derby (G1) at Gulfstream Park, the Santa Anita Derby (G1) at Santa Anita Park, the Arkansas Derby (G1) at Oaklawn Park, the Louisiana Derby (G2) at Fair Ground Race Course, the Blue Grass Stakes (currently G2) at Keeneland Race Course and the Wood Memorial Stakes (currently G2) at Aqueduct Racetrack. There are two wild card races with points offered on a 20-8-4-2 basis.\nThe series originally consisted of 36 races in 2013 and has since changed over the years to include 46 races with the addition of the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby (beginning in 2017) and European Road to the Kentucky Derby (beginning in 2018) series.\nIn addition to qualifying via the Road to the Kentucky Derby, various fees are required to start in the Derby: a nomination fee, an entry fee and a starter fee. For example, in 2013 horses born in 2010 were eligible and the nomination fee was $600 which was to be paid by January 26, 2013. If the January date was missed, a late nomination fee of $6,000 could be paid by March 23, 2013. In addition, owners with qualifying horses were required to pay $25,000 to enter the Derby by May 1, 2013, and an additional $25,000 to start. If a qualifying horse was not nominated in either January or March, it could be supplemented to the Derby for $200,000.\n2013 season.\nThe 2013 season consisted of 36 races (19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 17 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season).\n2014 season.\nThe 2014 season consisted of 34 races (18 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season).\n2015 season.\nThe 2015 season consisted of 35 races (19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season).\n2016 season.\nThe 2016 season consisted of 35 races (19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season).\n2017 season.\nThe 2017 season consisted of 37 races (19 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season, 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season, and 2 races for the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby).\n2018 season.\nThe 2018 season consisted of 46 races (20 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season, 16 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season, 7 races for the European Road to the Kentucky Derby, and 3 races for the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby).\n2019 season.\nThe 2019 season consisted of 46 races (35 races in North America and Dubai on the main Road, 7 races for the European Road and 4 races for the Japan Road to the Kentucky Derby).\n2020 season.\nOriginally, the 2020 season consisted of 46 races (35 races in North America and Dubai on the main Road, 7 races for the European Road and 4 races for the Japan Road), with only minor changes from 2019. However, the season was heavily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the cancellation or rescheduling of most of the major prep races.\n2021 season.\nThe 2021 road consisted of 36 races, 20 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Prep Season\" and 16 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Championship Season.\"\n2022 season.\nThe 2022 road consisted of 37 races, 21 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Prep Season\" and 16 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Championship Season.\"\n2023 season.\nThe 2023 road consisted of 37 races, 21 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Prep Season\" and 16 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Championship Season.\"\n2024 season.\nThe 2024 road consists of 37 races, 21 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Prep Season\" and 16 races for the \"Kentucky Derby Championship Season.\" \nFor 2024, the main Road to the Kentucky Derby resembled the 2023 Road to the Kentucky Derby, consisting of 37 races, with 22 races for the Kentucky Derby Prep Season and 15 races for the Kentucky Derby Championship Season with the following changes:"

        "title": "2014 Tour de France",
        "text": "The 2014 Tour de France was the 101st edition of the race, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race included 21 stages, starting in Leeds, Yorkshire, United Kingdom, on 5 July and finishing on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 27 July. The race also visited Belgium for part of a stage. Vincenzo Nibali of the team won the overall general classification by more than seven minutes, the biggest winning margin since 1997. By winning, he had acquired victories in all Grand Tours. Jean-Christophe Péraud () placed second, with Thibaut Pinot () third.\nMarcel Kittel of was the first rider to wear the general classification leader's yellow jersey after winning stage one. He lost the following day to stage winner Nibali as the race reached the mountains. Nibali held the race lead until the end of the ninth stage, when it was taken by 's Tony Gallopin. The yellow jersey returned to Nibali the following stage, and he held it until the conclusion of the race.\nThe points classification was decided early in the race and was won by 's Peter Sagan. Rafał Majka of , winner of two mountain stages, won the mountains classification. Pinot finished as the best young rider. The team classification was won by and Alessandro De Marchi () was given the award for the most combative rider. Kittel and Nibali won the most stages, with four each.\nFollowing criticism by the professional women's peloton and campaign groups like Le Tour Entier regarding the lack of a women's Tour de France, a one day women's race - La Course by Le Tour de France - was held on the Champs-Élysées, prior to the last stage of the Tour.\nTeams.\nTwenty-two teams participated in the 2014 edition of the Tour de France. The race was the 18th of the 29 events in the UCI World Tour, and all of its eighteen UCI ProTeams were automatically invited, and obliged, to attend the race. On 14 January 2015, the organiser of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), announced the four second-tier UCI Professional Continental teams given wildcard invitations: , , and . The team presentation – where the members of each team's roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place at the First Direct Arena in Leeds, United Kingdom, on 3 July, two days before the opening stage held in the city. The riders arrived at the arena by a ceremonial ride from the University of Leeds. The event included performances from Embrace and Opera North, in front of an audience of 10,000.\nEach squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, therefore the start list contained a total of 198 riders. Of these, 47 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from 34 countries; France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Germany, Australia and Belgium all had 10 or more riders in the race. 's Ji Cheng was the first Chinese rider to participate in the Tour. Riders from eight countries won stages during the race; German riders won the largest number of stages, with seven. The average age of riders in the race was 29.88 years, ranging from the 20-year-old Danny van Poppel to the 42-year-old Jens Voigt, both riders. Voigt, riding in his final year as a professional, equalled Stuart O'Grady's record for most appearances in the Tour with 17. had the highest average age, while had the lowest.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nPre-race favourites.\nAccording to many observers before the race the top two favourites for the general classification were Chris Froome () and Alberto Contador (). Their closest rivals were thought to have been Vincenzo Nibali () and Alejandro Valverde (). A possible contender was the 2013 Tour runner-up, Nairo Quintana, who had chosen not to ride the Tour after his 2014 Giro d'Italia win that took place during May. Andy Schleck (), who was retroactively awarded the 2010 Tour title, was selected by his team as a domestique, and was not considered a possible favourite. The other riders considered contenders for the general classification were Andrew Talansky (), Rui Costa (), Thibaut Pinot (), Tejay van Garderen (), Jurgen Van den Broeck ().\nDefending champion and runner-up in the 2012 Tour, Froome, had shown his form so far in the 2014 season by winning the general classification of two stage races, the Tour of Oman and the Tour de Romandie. Contador, winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours, also won two stage races, the Tirreno–Adriatico and the Tour of the Basque Country in the lead-up to the Tour, placing second overall in the Volta ao Algarve, Volta a Catalunya and Critérium du Dauphiné. Nibali had missed the 2013 Tour as he had focused on the 2013 Giro, which he won. His highest Tour result was third in 2012. His best results so far in the 2014 season were fifth in the Tour de Romandie and seventh in the Dauphiné. Valverde, who placed eighth in the 2013 Tour and won the 2009 Vuelta a España, had a number of wins in the 2014 season prior to the Tour, most notably, the Vuelta a Andalucía stage race and the La Flèche Wallonne one-day race.\nThe sprinters considered favourites for the points classification and wins on the flat or hilly bunch sprint finishes were Peter Sagan (), Mark Cavendish (), André Greipel (), Alexander Kristoff () and riders Marcel Kittel and John Degenkolb. Winner of the points classification in the two previous Tours, Sagan, had won the E3 Harelbeke one-day race and won the points classifications in three stage races, the Tirreno–Adriatico, the Tour of California and the Tour de Suisse, during the 2014 season up until the Tour. Cavendish, who won the points classification in 2011, had nine wins so far in the season and had the full backing of his team. Greipel had amassed a total of twelve wins during the season prior to the Tour, but his team would have to share support for him and Van den Broeck. Kristoff had won the Milan–San Remo, and was considered a dark horse for the points classification. Kittel was seen as a top contender for the bunch sprints, as he won the most stages in the 2013 Tour, a total of four. He had an amassed seven wins so far in the season, two of which were in the Giro. It was thought that Degenkolb would be used by for the more challenging sprints. His major results of the season were first place in Gent–Wevelgem and second place in Paris–Roubaix, both one-day races.\nRoute and stages.\nOn 14 December 2012, the ASO announced that the English historic county of Yorkshire would host the 2014 edition's early stages (known as the \"Grand Départ\"). Further details of the first three stages held in the United Kingdom were released on 17 January 2013. This was the fourth Tour to contain stages in the United Kingdom, after 1974, 1994 and 2007. The entire route was announced by the ASO on 23 October 2013 at the official presentation at the Palais des Congrès in Paris. At the event, Stephen Roche, winner of the 1987 Tour, described the route as \"fairly soft\". Notable features of the route were the fifth stage's sections of sett paving, the five high altitude stage finishes and the lack time trialling, with only stage twenty's individual time trial.\nThe first of the two stages held in Yorkshire started in Leeds and finished in Harrogate, with stage two held between York and Sheffield. After a transfer to the East Anglian city of Cambridge, the race went south to the finish in London. The Tour transferred across the English Channel to the start of stage four Le Touquet-Paris-Plage, with the finish in Lille. Stage five began in Ypres, Belgium, and finished back in France. The following three stages crossed the north-east to the Vosges Mountains for stages nine and ten. The eleventh stage took place between Besançon and Oyonnax through the Jura Mountains. Stage twelve headed west to Saint-Étienne, with the next stage moving back east into the Chartreuse Mountains, with the finish at the Alpine ski resort of Chamrousse. The fourteenth stage ended in the town of Risoul. The following stage took the race south to Nîmes. After a transfer to Carcassonne, the route moved into the Pyrenees for the next two stages. The nineteenth stage took a northerly direction to the department of Dordogne and the location of stage twenty. A long transfer took the Tour back to the north-east to finish with the Champs-Élysées stage in Paris.\nThere were 21 stages in the race, covering a total distance of . The longest mass-start stage was the seventh at , and stage 17 was the shortest at . Nine stages were officially classified as flat, five as medium mountain and six as high mountain. Stage five, although classified as medium mountain, was flat with sett paving sections. There were five summit finishes: stage 10, to La Planche des Belles Filles; stage 13, to Chamrousse; stage 14, to Risoul; stage 17, to Saint-Lary Pla d’Adet; and stage 18, to Hautacam. The highest point of elevation in the race was the -high Col d'Izoard mountain pass on stage fourteen. It was among six \"hors catégorie\" (English: beyond category) rated climbs in the race. There were nine new stage start or finish locations. The rest days were after stage 10, in the Besançon, and after 15, in Carcassonne.\nRace overview.\nOpening week and Vosges.\nThe first stage's bunch sprint finish was won by Marcel Kittel. A crash in the sprint caused Mark Cavendish, a favourite for the win, to fall; he did not start stage two. Kittel gained the race leader's yellow jersey and the green jersey as the leader of the points classification, with Jens Voigt taking the polka dot jersey as the leader of the mountains classification. In the following stage, likened to a \"mini Liège-Bastogne-Liège\", Vincenzo Nibali took the stage win and yellow jersey, attacking on Sheffield's hilly terrain with remaining. Peter Sagan took the green jersey and Cyril Lemoine () took the polka dot jersey. Stages three and four, finishing in London and Lille respectively, ended in bunch sprints and were both won by Kittel. Crashes in stages four and five forced pre-race favourite Chris Froome to abandon the race; his injuries were later revealed to be fractures to his left wrist and right hand. The weather was wet throughout the fifth stage, with the sett paving causing many crashes (although not Froome's). The fractured ending was won by an attack in the final by Lars Boom of . Nibali, who placed third, extended his overall lead over his rivals, with Alberto Contador 2 min 37 s down. André Greipel won stage six's bunch sprint in Reims. Another bunch sprint took place at the end of the next stage, with the hilly finish decided by a photo finish between Sagan and the winner Matteo Trentin ().\nStage eight, the first at altitude, was taken by 's Blel Kadri, who attacked from a breakaway group with to go; he managed to hold his lead over the chasing group of overall favourites, who came in over two minutes behind. His win put Kadri into the polka dot jersey. Another solo victory came the following day, when Tony Martin of dropped fellow breakaway rider Alessandro De Marchi () with remaining. A large group that formed in pursuit of the duo finished 2 min 45 s behind, with the unconcerned general classification contenders coming together in at 7 min 46 s down. The yellow jersey went to a rider from the first group, 's Tony Gallopin. Martin now led the mountains classification. Stage ten was the Tour's first high mountain stage. On the final climb to the finish at La Planche des Belles Filles, Nibali attacked from the group of overall contenders with remaining, passed two surviving riders from the day's early breakaway, and claimed his second stage win, which put him back in the yellow jersey. Joaquim Rodríguez (), one of the two breakaway riders, took the polka dot jersey. Contador crashed during the descent of the Petit Ballon, into the stage, forcing him to quit the race; it was later revealed that he had fractured his right tibia. The next day was the first rest day of the Tour.\nJura and Alps.\nStage eleven's rolling terrain resulted in a final peloton that included mainly puncheurs; Gallopin won the stage after an attack from the finish in Oyonnax split the peloton and a second with remaining that successfully held off the chasers. The twelfth stage was won by Alexander Kristoff from a bunch sprint. Nibali took the stage win the following stage, making his move from the leading group in the final on the \"hors catégorie\" climb to Chamrousse. He extended his lead over the second-placed overall rider Alejandro Valverde to 3 min 37 s. Richie Porte, who was second overall before the stage and the new leader of , lost around nine minutes and dropped to sixteenth. Nibali took the lead of the mountains classification. In stage fourteen, Rafał Majka () attacked from a reduced breakaway on the climb to the finish in Risoul with remaining and managed to hold off chasing the group of overall favourites and soloed to victory. Nibali, second in the stage, extended his lead further by one minute as Valverde lost time and Rodríguez regained the polka dot jersey. Kristoff won the bunch sprint in the transitional stage fifteen.\nIn the first of the three stages in the Pyrenees, the sixteenth, a breakaway group of 21 riders formed in. The group reduced to five after the final climb, the \"hors catégorie\" Port de Balès with remaining, out of which came the winner, Michael Rogers of (), who attacked from finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon. The group of general classification favourites came in over eight minutes down. Majka led the mountains classification. The Tour's queen stage, the seventeenth, featured three first-category climbs and the \"hors catégorie\" climb to the finish at Saint-Lary Pla d’Adet. An early nine-strong breakaway was pulled back before the first climb by for their rider Rodríguez to take the mountains classification points and the temporary lead of the competition. This led to the formation of a large lead group which gradually split across the middle climbs. Rodriguez and Majka led the lead group race over the penultimate climb, with the former first. On the final climb, a group of four that had escaped were caught by Majka, who had dropped Rodríguez, and he soloed to claim his second stage win and the large number of points for the summit finish. Nibali had split apart the group of chasing overall favourites and came in third. Second-placed overall Valverde lost a minute to Thibaut Pinot in third.\nPyrenees and finale.\nThe Tour's final mountain stage, the eighteenth, saw Nibali take his fourth victory of the race at Hautacam; his stage winning move came from the finish, on the climb to Hautacam. He finished 1 min 10 s ahead of a group which were four of his nearest general classification rivals, with the exception of Valverde, who lost further time and dropped to fourth overall, displaced by Thibaut Pinot and Jean-Christophe Péraud, respectively. Majka finished third in the stage and secured the mountains classification. In stage nineteen, Ramūnas Navardauskas of attacked a peloton fractured by rain from the finish to win the stage. Martin claimed his second stage of the Tour in the penultimate stage's individual time trial. His time of 1h 6 min 21 s over the course was 1 min 39 s faster than second-placed Tom Dumoulin (). Nibali finished fourth, increasing his advantage.\nIn the final stage, Kittel secured a second successive victory on the Champs-Élysées in Paris, his fourth stage win of the race. Nibali finished the race to win the general classification by a margin of 7 min 39 s, the largest winning margin since Jan Ullrich in the 1997 Tour. Second and third respectively were Péraud and Pinot, with the latter 8 min 15 s down on Nibali. The points classification was won by Sagan with 431 points; Kristoff came second with 282 points. Majka finished with 181 points in the mountains classification, 13 ahead of second-placed Nibali. Pinot was the best young rider, with Romain Bardet () second. The team classification was won by , 34 min 46 s ahead of second-placed . Of the 198 starters, 164 reached the finish of the last stage in Paris.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nThere were four main individual classifications contested in the 2014 Tour de France, as well as a team competition. The most important was the general classification, which was calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. There were no time bonuses given at the end of stages for this edition of the Tour. If a crash had happened within the final of a stage, not including the time trial and summit finishes, the riders involved would have received the same time as the group they were in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered the overall winner of the Tour. The rider leading the classification wore a yellow jersey.\nThe second classification was the points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type. The leader was identified by a green jersey.\nThe third classification was the mountains classification. Points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double points were awarded on the summit finishes on stages 10, 13, 14, 17 and 18. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification. This was calculated the same way as the general classification, but the classification was restricted to riders who were born on or after 1 January 1989. The leader wore a white jersey.\nThe final classification was a team classification. This was calculated using the finishing times of the best three riders per team on each stage; the leading team was the team with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders in the team that lead this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who has demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trial and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, Alessandro De Marchi won the overall super-combativity award, again, decided by a jury.\nA total of €2,035,000 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €450,000, with the second and third placed riders got €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers of the race were awarded with money. The holders of the classifications benefited on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were given €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider got €20,000. The winners of the team classification received €50,000. There were also two special awards each with a prize of €5000, the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col d'Izoard in stage fourteen, and the Souvenir Jacques Goddet, given to the first rider to pass Goddet's memorial at the summit of the Col du Tourmalet in stage eighteen. Joaquim Rodríguez won the Henri Desgrange and Blel Kadri won the Jacques Goddet.\nUCI World Tour rankings.\nRiders from the ProTeams competing individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the World Tour rankings. Points were awarded to the top twenty finishers in the general classification and to the top five finishers in each stage. The 200 points accrued by Vincenzo Nibali moved him from fortieth position to second in the individual ranking. retained their lead of the team ranking, ahead of second-placed . Spain remained as leaders of the nation ranking, with Italy second."

        "title": "2012–13 PBA Tour season",
        "text": "This is a recap of the 2012–13 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It was the tour's 54th season, and the fourth straight season in which all of the North American fall events are condensed into the PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB). The season consisted of 34 individual title events, plus a \"PBA League\" team title event. The PBA billed 2012–13 as a \"super season\", running longer than one full year, in preparation for a return to a calendar-year season format for 2014.\nThis is also the first season since 2003–04 in which all events are open to any PBA member, as the Tour has abandoned the \"exempt\" tour format that began in the 2004–05 season. While \"exempt\" status for touring players has been dropped, the PBA Tour will still have a points system which affects a few events as well as \"Touring 1\" and \"Touring 2\" player statuses.\nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the fourth season in a row, the PBA held the fall North American events in one location at the GEICO PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB). Preliminary rounds of the televised tournaments were November 3–7, with television tapings on November 10–11. All of the events were held at the South Point Casino's bowling center in Las Vegas, Nevada. The season will run an unprecedented 14 months, concluding with a second PBA World Series of Bowling in the fall of 2013. This is in preparation for a move to a calendar year national tour format in 2014. In all, the 2012–13 season will have 40 title events, including 15 international tour stops. The international stops are part of the World Bowling Tour (WBT), but will award PBA titles to winners who are full-fledged PBA members at the time of the tournament (including members of international PBA organizations).\nThe World Series of Bowling for 2012 included four stand-alone title tournaments (Cheetah Championship, Viper Championship, Chameleon Championship and Scorpion Championship), plus the PBA World Championship major. The qualifying rounds of each stand-alone \"animal pattern\" event (8 games each for a total of 32 games) also served as the initial qualifying for the PBA World Championship. The PBA World Championship then held match-play for the top 24 bowlers on November 8–9. The WBT Men's and WBT Women's final rounds were also taped at the WSOB for a later TV broadcast. The WBT Men's final is now a PBA title event (it was not in 2011). All final rounds at the 2012 WSOB returned to a stepladder format, after an \"eliminator\" format was used for several events in 2011.\nFollowing the WSOB, the Round1 Japan Cup invitational tournament (formerly Dydo Japan Cup) took place November 29 – December 2 in Japan. This tournament, which typically includes a number of PBA Tour players and is a PBA title event, was not held in 2011 due to the earthquake and resulting tsunami in Japan.\nAfter three more international tour stops, the \"PBA Winter Swing\" commenced in North America with four tournaments in Allen Park, Michigan held January 19–28, 2013. The \"PBA Summer Swing\" took place May 19 – June 2, with four full tournaments held in and around Milwaukee, Wisconsin, plus a made-for-TV \"King of the Swing\" stepladder final. The remaining three major tournaments are spread out through 2013 (USBC Masters in February, Barbasol PBA Tournament of Champions in March, and U.S. Open in July).\nTournament summary.\nBelow is a schedule of events for the 2012–13 PBA Tour season. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (x)."

With this, they repeated the feat of Dagoberto Midosi and Ivan Severo, who, in 1954, also reached this stage in the World Championship held in Wembley, England. In singles, Monteiro's best results at the World Championships were the 2nd rounds of 2009 and 2021. In mixed doubles, the best result was the 2nd round in 2013.\nAt the 2004 Table Tennis World Cup, held in Hangzhou, China, he beat Olympic champion Seung Min Ryu, from South Korea, by 4 sets to 3 (5-11, 10-12, 11-8, 11-6, 8-11, 11-8, 11-8). \nThroughout his career, Monteiro won eight medals at the Pan American Games: four gold, one silver and three bronze.

        "title": "2012 Tour de France, Stage 11 to Stage 20",
        "text": "Stage 11 of the 2012 Tour de France was contested on 12 July and the race concluded with Stage 20 on 22 July. The second half of the race was situated entirely within France; starting with a mountain stage from Albertville to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles – incorporating two hors catégorie climbs during the stage – before the customary race-concluding stage finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.\nFollowing his victory in the ninth stage individual time trial, rider Bradley Wiggins held the lead into the second half of the race. He maintained his race lead throughout the second half of the race, holding a lead of 2 minutes and 5 seconds – transpiring from stage 9 – until the race's final individual time trial, held on the penultimate day of the race. Wiggins won the stage by 1 minute and 16 seconds ahead of his team-mate Chris Froome, and Wiggins ultimately held his lead into Paris the following day to win the race overall by 3 minutes and 21 seconds, to become the first rider from Great Britain to win a Grand Tour race. Froome finished second, while the final podium was completed by former Vuelta a España winner Vincenzo Nibali, riding for the team, who was the only other rider to finish within 10 minutes of Wiggins' final overall time.\nOnly Wiggins' team-mate Mark Cavendish was able to win more than one stage during the second half of the race, winning two of the final three stages including a fourth consecutive final stage victory in Paris. This victory allowed him to become the most prolific sprinter at the Tour de France with 23 stage victories, surpassing the record of 22 which had been held for 48 years by France's André Darrigade. Three French riders – Pierre Rolland, Pierrick Fédrigo and Thomas Voeckler – each took a stage victory during the second half of the race, with Voeckler's victory in the queen stage helping in part for him to become the eventual winner of the mountains classification. Other stage victories were taken by David Millar, André Greipel, Luis León Sánchez and Alejandro Valverde.\nDuring the fourteenth stage of the race, Wiggins neutralised the peloton on the descent from the Mur de Péguère climb, after carpet tacks were found to be responsible for around thirty punctures on the climb itself. Among those delayed was the defending champion Cadel Evans, who suffered three punctures on the climb and had lost around two minutes before Wiggins called a truce in the main field, allowing the breakaway to finish the stage over eighteen minutes clear of the pack. Following the raid of the team hotel during the first rest day, the second rest day was marked by a positive drugs test by rider Fränk Schleck, the third-placed rider from the 2011 race. Schleck quit the race after traces of xipamide, a banned sulfonamide diuretic drug, were found in the A-sample of his urine, and was later confirmed by the B-sample.\nStage 11.\n12 July 2012 — Albertville to La Toussuire-Les Sybelles, \nThe stage was spent entirely in the Alps with two hors catégorie climbs – the Col de la Madeleine after and the Col de la Croix de Fer after ; both of which had summits at or higher – before the finish at La Toussuire-Les Sybelles. The Col de la Croix de Fer was the highest point reached in the Alps in the 2012 Tour, so the leader across the summit would win the Souvenir Henri Desgrange. The finish was a first-category climb of at an average gradient of 6.1%. Much like the previous day, a large breakaway was formed after several different groups advanced clear of the main field as they approached the first climb of the day, at the Col de la Madeleine.\nIn total, there were 28 riders in the group at one point; at the top of the climb, the pace picked up and the group splintered into several mini-groups as 's Peter Velits scored the maximum points on offer for the climb, followed closely by rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Velits and Kessiakoff pulled out a 45-second advantage on the descent, but eight riders eventually bridged the gap and rejoined the duo before the Col de la Croix de Fer. had two riders in the group, with Christophe Kern setting the pace for team-mate Pierre Rolland, and the tempo was again splitting the group up. Back in the peloton, young rider classification leader Tejay van Garderen () attacked on the climb, as the benchmark for a later move by his team-mate Cadel Evans. They acquired a 30-second lead at one point before brought Bradley Wiggins back up to them. Kessiakoff just bettered Rolland for the mountains points atop the Col de la Croix de Fer, with the peloton around two minutes behind.\nThe group containing Wiggins and other overall contenders dropped a minute further back on the early parts of the Col du Mollard, where the breakaway consisted of Velits, Rolland, 's Chris Anker Sørensen and Robert Kišerlovski of , with 's Vasil Kiryienka later joining up. Rolland crashed on the descent from the climb, having taken first place points over the summit, while Sørensen was in difficulty to stay with the lead. rider Vincenzo Nibali tried to breach the peloton on two occasions on the final climb, catching up with 's Jurgen Van den Broeck who had escaped with eighth stage winner, 's Thibaut Pinot. Evans cracked on the climb, losing time to Wiggins, team-mate Chris Froome and other contenders. Froome put Wiggins into difficulty at one point, but backed the pace down via his team radio. Up front, Rolland was the last remaining rider of the breakaway, and soloed to his second Tour stage win, and his team's second stage win in a row. Pinot led the yellow jersey group across the line almost a minute down, while Evans lost almost 90 seconds on Wiggins, Froome and Nibali, who filled the top three places overall at the conclusion of the stage.\nStage 12.\n13 July 2012 — Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne to Annonay–Davézieux, \nWith a parcours of , the twelfth stage was the longest of the Tour; the race left the Alps but only after a pair of first-category climbs – the Col du Grand Cucheron and the Col du Granier – in the first , although there was also a third-category climb of the Côte d'Ardoix within the final , before the finish in Annonay-Davézieux. As had been the case in the previous two stages, there was another large breakaway group that set the tempo outside of the peloton in the early running. At its maximum, the group contained nineteen riders, but it had been reduced to eleven by the time the group reached the foot of the opening climb, the Col du Grand Cucheron.\nRobert Kišerlovski of took the maximum points on offer for the climb, to help protect the lead of the classification, held by team-mate Fredrik Kessiakoff. rider David Moncoutié tried to bridge the gap to reach the lead group, but crashed heavily on the descent from the climb. He had to abandon the race with abrasions. Kišerlovski also took maximum points on the Col du Granier, which made Kessiakoff's lead safe for another day. After reaching the mid-stage feeding zone in Saint-Joseph-de-Rivière, the lead group split and five riders – David Millar of , rider Jean-Christophe Péraud, 's Egoi Martínez, Kišerlovski and Cyril Gautier, looking to give a third win in a row – accelerated away to a near 13-minute lead at its maximum. With none of the riders being in overall contention, the peloton let the group go and decided not to chase them down before the finish.\nNone of the quintet attacked each other, and they remained as one into the final of the stage. Kišerlovski played his hand first, launching an attack with remaining, but Péraud closed down the move almost immediately; a secondary move took Martínez and Gautier out of the equation for the stage victory. Péraud accelerated again and Millar latched onto his wheel with Kišerlovski unable to follow the pair. Millar took the front inside the final , but Péraud remained on his wheel until just before to go; he launched his attack, but Millar beat him to the line for his fourth individual stage victory at the Tour – his first since 2003 – and the fourth different British rider to take a stage win at the 2012 Tour. The peloton was led across the line almost eight minutes down by the top two in the points classification, 's Matthew Goss and 's Peter Sagan. Sagan protested the sprint finish of Goss, feeling that he had impeded him in the closing metres. Race officials agreed with Sagan and demoted Goss to seventh – helped in part by a one-second time gap between them and the rest of the field – and penalised him 30 points in the classification, and 30 seconds overall.\nStage 13.\n14 July 2012 — Saint-Paul-Trois-Châteaux to Cap d'Agde, \nThis transitional stage took the Tour to the Mediterranean. The day's only categorised climb over Mont-Saint-Clair at Sète and the wind off the sea were two potential disruptions to the race in the final of the stage. For the celebration of Bastille Day, the breakaway had extensive French representation, with five of the eight-rider move – rider Samuel Dumoulin, 's Mathieu Ladagnous, Jimmy Engoulvent of , Maxime Bouet () and Jérôme Pineau, representing the team – from the country. The group was rounded out by Pablo Urtasun of , 's Michael Mørkøv and rider Roy Curvers.\nThe octet made their escape in the opening of the stage, and their advantage eventually stemmed to a maximum of almost 10 minutes at the mark, before sent riders forward to the front of the peloton in order to bring the gap down. Urtasun led the group across the line at the stage's intermediate sprint point in Mas-de-Londres, but behind, points classification leader Peter Sagan () was able to launch his sprint for the line before 's sprinter Matthew Goss did so, and extended his lead in the standings as a result. Pineau looked to go clear with to go, but his move was anticipated by Mørkøv, before he attacked of his own accord. Mørkøv held a one-minute advantage over his former breakaway companions all the way to the foot of the Mont-Saint-Clair, but the peloton were able to close the advantage to them all before the summit of the climb.\n's Cadel Evans and rider Jurgen Van den Broeck both attacked on the Mont-Saint-Clair, and their accelerated pace ripped the peloton apart, with many riders falling off the back of the peloton. Around 25 riders remained in the lead group, with only Sagan and Van Den Broeck's team-mate André Greipel out of the sprinters making the group. Further moves came from rider Alexander Vinokourov, Michael Albasini of , and 's Luis León Sánchez, but they were closed down by – looking after Greipel for the finish – and for race leader Bradley Wiggins. Wiggins led out team-mate Edvald Boasson Hagen for the sprint, but Greipel launched his own off his wheel and managed to fend off a quick-finishing Sagan to take his third stage win of the Tour by half a wheel, the first such feat by a German rider since Erik Zabel in 2001.\nStage 14.\n15 July 2012 — Limoux to Foix, \nThe race entered the lower Pyrenees with two first-category climbs; the Port de Lers and the Mur de Péguère, reaching an elevation of . The Mur de Péguère was featuring for the first time in the Tour de France; with sections of the climb in excess of 16%. Small attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for the first hour of racing after the attacks were closed down shortly after. It was not until a quarter of the way through the stage – some in – that a move was allowed to be established on the road, when eleven riders went clear including the points classification leader Peter Sagan of , who was looking to extend his points advantage over his rivals André Greipel () and rider Matthew Goss.\nBy the time that Sagan had crossed over the intermediate sprint line first, at Tarascon-sur-Ariège, the leaders' advantage was already over thirteen minutes, and was increasing by the kilometre due to the wet conditions on the roads. At the Port de Lers, the eleven riders were fifteen minutes clear when Cyril Gautier () developed a problem with his bike and had to stop for a change of equipment, losing around 40 seconds to his ten companions. He would not bridge back to them, and ultimately lost fourteen minutes to them by the stage finish. 's Luis León Sánchez attacked on the Mur de Péguère, with only Philippe Gilbert (), rider Gorka Izagirre and Sandy Casar of able to follow originally. Sagan later brought himself back up to the group, before Casar pulled a few seconds clear over the summit.\nAt the summit of the climb, carpet tacks were thrown onto the road causing as many as thirty riders to puncture, including Gilbert's team-mates Cadel Evans and Steve Cummings, while race leader Bradley Wiggins () changed his bike as a precaution. As a result, Wiggins called a temporary halt to the racing on the descent. At this time, Pierre Rolland () attacked and gained a two-minute margin over the peloton, but a combination of the tempo set by and , and Rolland realising the situation behind – later apologising for his actions – meant that he was brought back to the field, and they continued to slowly roll towards the finish in Foix. At the front, Sánchez attacked with around remaining, and eventually soloed his way to a fourth career stage victory at the Tour. Sagan led home a group of four riders almost a minute behind, while the peloton eventually crossed the line over eighteen minutes behind Sánchez.\nStage 15.\n16 July 2012 — Samatan to Pau, \nThe stage ran through the foothills of the Pyrenees, in the Gers and Pyrénées-Atlantiques departments. There were three minor climbs in the final third of the stage, which was expected to suit the remaining sprinters. Like the previous day, small attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for the first hour of racing after the attacks were unsuccessful. The most prominent of these was a five-rider move, involving 's Bert Grabsch, rider David Millar, Andriy Hryvko of , Rui Costa () and Yukiya Arashiro, representing . The peloton did not allow them to gain an advantage of more than 30 seconds, and they were eventually brought back to the main field at the mark.\nAnother five-rider group formed immediately thereafter, consisting of Christian Vande Velde (), Arashiro's team-mate Thomas Voeckler, 's Pierrick Fédrigo, rider Samuel Dumoulin and Dries Devenyns of . rider Nicki Sørensen chased the quintet down for around , and eventually made the group a sextet, after his team set the tempo in the main field for a while. The peloton had reduced the gap to the leaders to around five minutes at one point, but eventually decided to allow the breakaway to battle it out for stage honours. Voeckler took maximum points on all three categorised climbs prior to the closing , before Sørensen launched the first sustained attacks prior to the finish. However, Fédrigo and Vande Velde gained some ground with their attack at to go, and they contested the sprint in Pau; Vande Velde tried to launch his sprint first, but Fédrigo saw the move and remained in front, to take his second stage win in Pau – after a previous victory in 2010 – and fourth of his career. The remaining members of the breakaway came in before the main field, with 's André Greipel leading them home 11' 50\" down on Fédrigo.\nStage 16.\n18 July 2012 — Pau to Bagnères-de-Luchon, \nAfter the second and final rest day, the race entered the high mountains with the queen stage crossing two hors catégorie climbs – the Col d'Aubisque and the Col du Tourmalet – followed by the first-category climbs of the Col d'Aspin and the Col de Peyresourde, completing the so-called \"Circle of Death\", before dropping down to the finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon. The first rider over the Tourmalet – the highest point reached in both the Pyrenees and the 2012 Tour as a whole at – received the Souvenir Jacques Goddet.\nAlmost forty riders – around a quarter of the race's peloton at the start of the stage – made it into the early breakaway after around , including three riders in the lower reaches of the top twenty placings overall, mountains classification leader Fredrik Kessiakoff () and stage-winners Thomas Voeckler of and rider Pierrick Fédrigo. Voeckler and Kessiakoff led the group over the top of the Col d'Aubisque, with the group remaining together until the foot of the Col du Tourmalet. Here, the group started to fragment after 's Dan Martin accelerated with Kessiakoff and 's Laurens ten Dam in tow. rider George Hincapie, Chris Anker Sørensen of and 's Brice Feillu later joined the group up front, but only Voeckler and Feillu remained together at the top of the climb, where Voeckler further cut into Kessiakoff's polka-dot jersey lead. The peloton crossed the summit around ten minutes later.\nVoeckler and Feillu had an advantage of almost two minutes at the bottom of the Col d'Aspin, while Martin – on his own after being the last to be dropped by the French pairing out front – was joined by Hincapie and six other riders. With added pressure from Sørensen and rider Jens Voigt, Kessiakoff was dropped by the group, and aided the efforts for Voeckler to take the lead in the mountains classification. Back in the peloton, the tempo set by and was reducing the numbers in the group, and eventually, 's Cadel Evans lost contact on the climb. However, with team-mates around him, he was able to rejoin the group before the final climb of the Col de Peyresourde. A third of the way up the climb, Voeckler left his companion Feillu behind, and set off on a solo attack. Evans again fell off the back of the group, as Vincenzo Nibali () decided to make a preliminary attack on his rivals, 's Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome.\nWiggins and Froome were able to make their way back up to Nibali, sandwiching him with Froome on the front and Wiggins at the back of the trio. Voeckler cemented his mountains classification lead by reaching the summit of the Col de Peyresourde first, with the remaining riders of the breakaway spread out between him and the group of Wiggins, Froome and Nibali. Sørensen trailed Voeckler by a minute-and-a-half. Nibali attacked twice more on the steepest part of the climb, but Wiggins shadowed the move and kept himself up with Nibali. At the front, Voeckler descended towards the finish in Bagnères-de-Luchon with a 1' 40\" lead over Sørensen, and held the lead to the end for his second stage win of the race, and repeated his 2010 stage victory in the town. Sørensen remained 1' 40\" behind in second, while rider Gorka Izagirre bested Alexander Vinokourov () for third place. Nibali, Wiggins and Froome came in seven minutes after Voeckler, while Evans lost almost five minutes to the trio, falling from fourth to seventh in the general classification behind rider Jurgen Van den Broeck, 's Haimar Zubeldia and his own team-mate Tejay van Garderen. rider Jan Ghyselinck finished four seconds outside the stage's cutoff time, but he was given a reprieve by the comissaires to continue in the Tour, making him the new lanterne rouge.\nStage 17.\n19 July 2012 — Bagnères-de-Luchon to Peyragudes, \nThe final day in the mountains saw the race cross the first-category Col de Menté and the second-category Col des Ares before reaching the last hors catégorie climb of the Tour, the Port de Balès. The race then dropped down, before returning over the uncategorised Col de Peyresourde – crossing the summit for the second consecutive day – followed by a summit finish at the Peyragudes ski resort. With a scheduled parcours of , the stage was the shortest of the mountain stages of the 2012 Tour.\nSmall attacks set the course of the early running of the stage, with the field remaining as a whole for the first half-hour of racing after several attacks were closed down before a gap could be established. It was not until the Col de Menté that the early foundations of a breakaway were laid with the two mountains classification combatants, 's Thomas Voeckler and Fredrik Kessiakoff of again battling it out for points; Voeckler prevailed ahead of Kessiakoff. The two riders were also a part of a seven-rider breakaway that formed on the descent from the climb. The group was also bolstered for a time by rider Vincenzo Nibali, third place in the general classification behind duo Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome, but he eventually sat up from the group as the breakaway was not likely to be given an advantage if Nibali was in the group.\nA ten-rider chase group formed behind the leaders, and eventually joined up with them around halfway through the stage. Voeckler bettered Kessiakoff at the Côte de Burs, to extend his lead in the classification; the peloton were around three minutes behind, but closing gradually. Following a move by a pair of riders, Rui Costa () attacked out of the group as a set-up for his team leader Alejandro Valverde, who followed his move several kilometres later. Costa paced him for a time before Valverde went clear on his own, and built up a 35-second lead at the summit of the Port de Balès, while the peloton had closed by half a minute to trail him by around two-and-a-half minutes. The peloton caught the group of chasers including Voeckler, rider Levi Leipheimer and Blel Kadri of , on the descent with only Valverde remaining ahead as they hit the Col de Peyresourde.\nFor the second ascent of the Col de Peyresourde during the race, the riders would take the climb in the opposite direction from what they had done on the previous day, before a slight descent and then the final climb to Peyragudes. Valverde held a lead of 1' 20\" at the top of the uncategorised pass, with only a handful of riders remaining with the group of the \"maillot jaune\", including the top four in the general classification. Valverde was holding his own off the front, and the gap was fluctuating between 1' 20\" and 1' 30\" for several kilometres as they neared the summit, which came at the \"flamme rouge\" point. 's Jurgen Van den Broeck tried to attack, but was pulled back by the Froome and Wiggins tandem, which then accelerated away from their rivals and set off after Valverde. Ultimately, they came up short due to Froome having to wait three times for Wiggins as the race leader was several metres behind his domestique on certain parts of the climb. Valverde achieved his fourth career stage victory at the Tour, nineteen seconds ahead of Froome and Wiggins, who in turn extended their advantage over the rest of the field.\nStage 18.\n20 July 2012 — Blagnac to Brive-la-Gaillarde, \nDespite being ranked a \"flat stage\", there were four ranked climbs during the day which had the potential to produce a successful break from the peloton. In the early kilometres of the stage, a group of six riders instigated the first breakaway of the day, but after the peloton allowed them to create an advantage on the roads, they were brought back to the confines of the peloton not long later. There was then an uneventful period in the action, with no major attacks going off the front, until the first categorised climb of the day, at the Côte de Saint-Georges.\nOn the climb itself, rider Nick Nuyens and 's Yukiya Arashiro attacked up the hill, before they were joined by fourteen other riders to create the second major breakaway of the day's stage. The best-placed rider amongst the group was Rui Costa of the – just under half an hour behind the race leader Bradley Wiggins of – who was fresh from his set-up work for team-mate Alejandro Valverde the previous day. Around halfway through the stage, the advantage between the sixteen leaders and the main field reached its highest point of the day, at the 3' 30\" mark, before and set the tempo to start bringing the leaders back to the peloton. In the peloton, several riders fell to the ground after a dog ran into their path, slowing the pace as a whole. Among those involved was 's Philippe Gilbert, who had to be restrained when back on his feet. sent their riders forward to set the pace on the front of the group in the hopes of setting Peter Sagan up for a fourth stage victory of the race, and the gap reduced under two minutes inside of remaining.\nAt the head of the race, 's David Millar attacked on the Côte de Souillac, where moves from Arashiro and Wiggins' team-mate Edvald Boasson Hagen followed not long later. Five riders – rider Adam Hansen, Alexander Vinokourov of , Nuyens, Luca Paolini () and 's Jérémy Roy – came together at the bottom of the Côte de Lissac-sur-Couze, before Nuyens and Roy were dropped on the climb. They were replaced in the group by 's Nicolas Roche, rider Andreas Klöden and Luis León Sánchez of , with the six riders remaining together off the front into the finishing straight in Brive-la-Gaillarde. Roche and Sánchez attacked for the line, but both riders were usurped by the finish of sprinter Mark Cavendish following a lead-out from Boasson Hagen. Cavendish went around the outside of the pairing and took his 22nd Tour stage victory on the line, matching the tallies of Lance Armstrong, and André Darrigade for fourth place in the all-time Tour stage wins list, and tying Darrigade's record for victories by a sprinter. 's Matthew Goss and Sagan also managed to get ahead of Sánchez and Roche in the closing stages, for second and third places respectively, but were around ten lengths behind Cavendish at the finish.\nStage 19.\n21 July 2012 — Bonneval to Chartres, , (ITT)\nThe penultimate stage of the Tour was the final individual time trial with good roads into the centre of the city of Chartres. With other noted specialists within the time trial discipline having already abandoned the race, the top two riders in the general classification – pairing Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome – were expected to be the favourites for the stage, having finished first and second in the ninth stage time trial. As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. Thus, Jimmy Engoulvent of , who, in 153rd place, trailed overall leader Wiggins by 3 hours, 49 minutes and 9 seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage.\nEngoulvent recorded a time of 1 hour, 12 minutes and 49 seconds for the course as he was first to reach the line; but his lead was short-lived as several minutes later, rider Julien Fouchard went round the course over two minutes quicker than the time of Engoulvent. 's Johan Vansummeren was the first rider to record a time below 1 hour and 10 minutes with a time of 1 hour, 9 minutes and 24 seconds, before rider Patrick Gretsch recorded a time almost three minutes quicker, having passed the two riders that started directly before him – at one-minute intervals – on the course, and another on the finish line. Gretsch's time held for a considerable amount of time – around 2 hours – and was ultimately good enough for him to place sixth in the final stage results. It was not until the 88th rider to start the course that his time was beaten. Luis León Sánchez of set the best time at each of the three intermediate time-checks along the parcours and eventually crossed the finish line in a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes and 3 seconds, to surpass Gretsch's time by thirty-eight seconds.\nThe Spanish national champion's time held right into the final riders to take to the course, now at three-minute intervals for the last 14 riders. 's Tejay van Garderen, the holder of the white jersey for the young rider classification leader, went beneath Sánchez's time at the first split, but faded on the rest of the course and eventually finished 44 seconds outside of his time in third place. He had already passed his team-mate Cadel Evans, who had started three minutes ahead, on course, and the Boulder, Colorado native later dedicated his performance to the victims of the shooting in nearby Aurora. Only Froome and Wiggins beat the time of van Garderen at the first time-point, with Wiggins beating Froome by a dozen seconds; Wiggins continued to extend his lead on course, holding a 54-second buffer at the second time-check, and 1' 15\" at the third. Froome crossed the line in a time of 1 hour, 5 minutes and 29 seconds to beat Sánchez's time by 34 seconds, but Wiggins achieved his second stage win of the race, adding one second to his advantage between the third time-check and the finish; punching the air as he crossed the finish line. The only change in positions for the general classification inside the top ten was Evans being passed for sixth place by 's Haimar Zubeldia – despite nearly hitting a barrier during his pass through the course – by a margin of eight seconds.\nStage 20.\n22 July 2012 — Rambouillet to Paris (Champs-Élysées), \nThe Tour concluded with the now-customary stage finish on the Champs-Élysées in Paris. The stage had an easy start – with two fourth-category climbs apart, inside the first third of the stage – before eight high-speed laps, followed by the finish, which was expected to result in a sprint for the line. In keeping with tradition, the final stage began at a slow pace, and was a largely ceremonial procession through the suburbs of Paris. Shortly after the riders reached the circuit in the centre of the city, racing began in earnest, and after various unsuccessful attempts, the main break was initiated by Jens Voigt () and 's Danilo Hondo with around to go.\nHondo led the field across the final intermediate sprint point of the race, with Voigt just behind. Hondo did not remain out front however, as Voigt was eventually joined by ten other riders to form the breakaway, with their advantage eventually reaching a maximum of around thirty seconds in the closing stages. Hondo later crashed on the final lap, along with rider Mikaël Cherel, but both riders eventually remounted to finish the stage. As the peloton closed down the leaders' advantage, mainly through the work of , and , the breakaway lost members, until they were all caught with remaining. The lead-out train for Mark Cavendish (), which included race leader Wiggins, held the lead of the race through the final corners, and he won the final stage for the fourth successive year, becoming the first incumbent world champion to win on the Champs-Élysées. His 23rd stage victory allowed him to move into fourth place on the all-time Tour stage wins list, while the leaders of the four classifications finished in the peloton to secure their victories, and the traditional prize-giving was made shortly after the race."

The reigning champions entering the season were Harlequins, who had claimed their first title after defeating Leicester Tigers in the 2012 final. London Welsh had been promoted as champions from the 2011–12 RFU Championship, their first promotion to the top flight.\nSummary.\nLeicester Tigers won their tenth title after defeating Northampton Saints in the final at Twickenham, having finished second in the regular season table. London Welsh were relegated, in part, for having received a 5-point deduction for fielding a player who did not hold an Effective Registration. It was the first time that London Welsh had been relegated from the top flight since they first achieved promotion.\nAs usual, round 1 included the London Double Header at Twickenham, the ninth instance since its inception in 2004.\nRule changes.\nFor the second consecutive season, significant changes were made to the Premiership's salary cap. Last season, \"academy credits\" were introduced, giving each team a £30,000 cap credit for each of up to eight home-grown players in the senior squad. This season, the team cap rose for the first time since the 2008–09 season when it was increased from £2.2 million to £4 million. The new cap is £4.26 million before academy credits and up to £4.5 million with credits. In addition, each team was allowed to sign one player whose salary did not count against the cap.\nTeams.\nTwelve teams compete in the league – the top eleven teams from the previous season and London Welsh, who were promoted from the 2011–12 RFU Championship to the top flight for the first time. They replaced Newcastle Falcons, who were relegated after fifteen years in the top flight.\nPre-season.\nFollowing a lengthy appeal, London Welsh successfully gained promotion to the Premiership, having contested the Professional Game Boards recommendation to refuse them entry based on the Minimum Standards Criteria. This meant that Newcastle Falcons were relegated, following their confirmation that they would not appeal the new decision.\nThe 2012 edition of the Premiership Rugby Sevens Series began on 13 July 2012 at The Stoop, continued on 20 July at Edgeley Park, and 26 July at Kingsholm. This was the first opportunity of the season for any of the teams competing in the Premiership to win a trophy. The finals were held on 3 August 2012 at The Recreation Ground, and the Series was won by London Irish.\nRegular season.\nPremiership Rugby announced the fixture list on 4 July 2012. As with previous seasons, Round 1 included the London Double Header at Twickenham.\nFixtures as per Premiership Rugby Match Centre.\nRound 22.\nAll games in Round 22 kicked off at 15.00 on 4 May 2013, so as to not give any team a potential advantage with regards to knowing how to achieve a play-off berth, Heineken Cup place, or safety from relegation.\nPlay-offs.\nAs in previous seasons, the top four teams in the Premiership table, following the conclusion of the regular season, contest the play-off semi-finals in a 1st vs 4th and 2nd vs 3rd format, with the higher ranking team having home advantage. The two winners of the semi-finals then meet in the Premiership Final at Twickenham on 25 May 2013.\nFinal.\nThe final was contested at Twickenham on 25 May 2013 between Leicester Tigers and Northampton Saints with Leicester winning 37–17.

It became a State Based Rugby Organization (SBRO) under the USA Rugby umbrella in 2009.\nClubs.\nYouth.\nBig Island\nOahu"

Along with the Leinster Cricket Union, Munster Cricket Union, Northern Cricket Union and North West Cricket Union, it makes up Cricket Ireland (formerly known as the Irish Cricket Union). It is the main union under which cricket in the traditional Irish province of Connacht is played. It broke away from Munster Cricket Union and became a separate union in 2010, thus becoming the first Union to be formed in over 60 years.\nAs of 2012, it has nine teams registered to the union, with seven playing in the League and eight in the Cups. It organises the Connacht Senior League (which is in its fourteenth season) and Connacht Senior Cup. 2012 saw sides from the CCU enter the national cup competitions for the first time. All the clubs were targeting under-age cricket as the next step and planning to kick off an under-age league over the next two years."

        "text": "The Canada women's national basketball team () represents Canada in international basketball competitions. They are overseen by Canada Basketball, the governing body for basketball in Canada.\nHistory.\n2015 Pan American Games.\nThe Canada women's national basketball team participated in basketball at the 2015 Pan American Games held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada from July 10 to 26, 2015. Canada opened the preliminary rounds with an easy 101–38 win over Venezuela. The following day they beat Argentina 73–58. The final preliminary game was against Cuba; both teams were 2–0, so the winner would win the group. The game went down to the wire with Canada eking out a 71–68 win. Canada would face Brazil in the semi-final.\nCanada opened the semi-final with an 11–2 run on seven consecutive points by Miranda Ayim. Miah-Marie Langlois contributed five assists. In the third quarter Canada strongly out rebounded Brazil and hit 69% of their field goals to score 33 points in the quarter. Lizanne Murphy and Nirra Fields hit three-pointers to help extend the lead to 68–39 at the end of three-quarters. Canada continued to dominate in the fourth quarter with three-pointers by Nurse and Kim Gaucher. Canada went on to win the game 91–63 to earn a spot in the gold-medal game against the United States.\nThe gold-medal game matched up the host team Canada against the United States, in a sold-out arena dominated by fans in red and white and waving the Canadian flag. The Canadian team, arm in arm, sang \"O Canada\" as the respective national anthems were played.\nAfter trading baskets early the U.S. edged out to a double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians, with the home crowd cheering, tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter Canada outscored the U.S. 26–15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The U.S. would fight back, but not all the way and Canada won the game and the gold-medal 81–73. It was Canada's first gold-medal in basketball in the Pan American games. Kia Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts in 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts including two of three three-pointers.\n2015 FIBA Americas Women's Championship.\nCanada participated at the 2015 FIBA Americas Women's Championship, a qualifying event used to determine invitations to the 2016 Olympics. The games were held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada in August 2015. Canada was assigned to Group A and played Puerto Rico, Chile, the Dominican Republic and Cuba in the preliminary rounds. Canada won the first three games easily with a 94–57 win over Puerto Rico as the closest match. The final preliminary round game was against undefeated Cuba, a team Canada had faced in the Pan American games. Cuba played well in that event and was expected to challenge Canada. However, Canada defeated Cuba 92–43 to win first place in the group for a spot in the semi-final against the second-place team in group B, Brazil.\nThe semi-final game against Brazil was much closer. Canada led by only six points at halftime but gradually expanded the lead to end up with an 83–66 win, and a spot in the gold-medal game. The gold-medal game was a rematch with Cuba who won their semi-final game against Argentina. Despite the lopsided result in the preliminary rounds, Canada expected a closer game. Cuba started off strong and had an eight-point lead early in the game. Canada responded with a 16–0 run to take over the lead, but Cuba responded and took a small lead early in the second half. Then Canada took the lead back and gradually expanded the lead to end up with the win, 82–66. As the game wound down to the close, the crowd was chanting \"Rio\",\"Rio\",\"Rio\" in recognition of the fact that the win qualifies Canada for the Olympics in Rio in 2016.\n2017–2020.\nComing off a gold medal at the 13th edition of the FIBA Women's AmeriCup, Canada entered the 2017 FIBA Women's AmeriCup as favourites. They finished group play with a 4–0 record, and advanced to the semifinals. In the finals, they would beat host nation Argentina 65–67 to win their second straight title. Nirra Fields was named MVP of the tournament. By virtue of finishing top three, they also qualified for 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup.\nThe Canadians made their debut at the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast, narrowly missing out on a podium finish, losing to New Zealand 74–68 in the third place game.\nTrying to build off their third best showing at FIBA's premier international tournament, Canada entered the 2018 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup being drawn in Group A, with France, Greece, and South Korea. Canada went as far as the quarterfinals, where they lost 53–68 to Spain.\nCanada had one last change to qualify for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo, participating at the 2020 FIBA Women's Olympic Qualifying Tournaments – Ostend. Canada would go on to top their group and qualified to the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nIn Tokyo, Canada were drawn to Group A with Spain, Serbia, and South Korea. They would finish with a 1–2 record with their only win against South Korea.\n2021–present.\nWith the approaching 2022 FIBA Women's World Cup, Canada Basketball hired Fenerbahçe head coach Víctor Lapeña to lead its women's program through the World Cup and possibly the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\nAt the 19th edition of the FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup, Canada was drawn in Group B. They ended group play with a 4–1 record, with their only loss being to group leaders Australia. In the knockout stage, Canada advanced all the way to the semifinals where they would eventually lose 43–83 to the United States. In the third place game, Canada fell 95-65 to Australia. The 4th place finish was Team Canada's best showing since winning bronze at the 1986 FIBA World Championship for Women. With her efforts in the tournament, Bridget Carleton was named to the All-Tournament Team.\nIn 2023, Canada participated at the 2023 FIBA Women's AmeriCup, where they were drawn into Group B.

Current members for the Australian Women's Team are (as of November 2022): Shawn Flegler (Chairman), Shelley Nitschke (also Head Coach), Avril Fahey and Julie Hayes.\nAustralia's selection panel for the men's team was changed in November 2016 after a disappointing start to the summer which included back to back losses to South Africa at Perth and Hobart, the low point being the batting collapse for a total of 84 at Hobart. The preceding losses away to Sri Lanka in Tests (lost 0–3) and to the South Africans in One-dayers (lost 0–5) added further fuel to the fire forcing the ex-incumbent Rod Marsh to resign from his position of chairman of selection panel on the eve of 16 November 2016 taking moral responsibility for the debacle. Thereafter, on 17 November 2016, Trevor Hohns (already a member selector since May 2014), a former Australian leg spinner and a former national selector from 1993 to 2006, was appointed as the interim chairman of the selection panel. In addition, Greg Chappell, Cricket Australia's then National Talent Manager, was appointed as an interim selector to complete the selection panel also comprising Mark Waugh and Australia's Head Coach Darren Lehmann.\nUntil 2003, there would be a selection panel appointed by the former Australian Cricket Board which would pick players for home games and overseas tours. However, on the overseas tours selections would be done by a committee consisting of the captain, vice-captain and manager."

Thompson was an immediate impact player for the Toreros, helping the team to the first NCAA tournament berth in program history in 1984. He was also named WCAC freshman of the year.\nFor the next three seasons, Thompson was named first-team WCAC All-Conference, becoming the first player in school history to be so honored. As a senior in 1986–87, Thompson led USD to a 24-6 record, its best in program history. The team drew more interest than their crosstown counterparts at San Diego State, and they managed to sell out home games while students were off during Christmas break. The Toreros lost a heart-breaking first-round game in the 1987 NCAA tournament to Auburn, 62-61. Thompson had a big individual year, averaging 15.9 points, 7.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game and becoming the first player in school history to be named WCAC player of the year. Still, the Toreros played together as a team and were not solely dependent on Thompson.\nThompson finished his career with 1,379 points (12.1 per game) and graduated as the school's leading Division I career scoring leader. He also left as the school's all time Division I rebounding leader with 740 (6.5 per game). Both marks have since been surpassed. Thompson was named to the USD athletic hall of fame in 2000.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating from USD, Thompson was drafted by the Washington Bullets in the fourth round (81st pick) of the 1987 NBA draft, however he never played in the league.

        "text": "Mark Nielsen (born 8 October 1977) is a former professional tennis player from New Zealand.\nCareer.\nNielsen had a highest junior ranking of 16th and during his early career on the juniors circuit had wins over Dominik Hrbatý, Mark Philippoussis and Paradorn Srichaphan. At the 1994 Australian Open, Nielsen and partner Jean-Noel Grinda Jr made the boys' doubles semi-finals. The following year he and countryman Teo Susnjak won doubles titles at the Australian Hardcourt Junior Championships and Philippines Junior Championships. \nIn 1997, Nielsen began playing Davis Cup tennis for New Zealand. He took part in a World Group play-off tie against Spain in 1999, which the New Zealanders lost without winning a match. Nielsen lost both of his singles rubbers, to Félix Mantilla and Francisco Clavet, but did take the former into a fifth set.\nNielsen was a wildcard entrant at the 1998 Heineken Open and in front of his home crowd defeated Brazilian Fernando Meligeni in the opening round, before being eliminated by Marcelo Ríos. He competed in the Heineken Open a further seven times and also reached the second round in 2002, with a win over seventh seed and world number 33 Andreas Vinciguerra. With partner James Shortall, Nielsen also made the quarter-finals of the doubles that year. He was a doubles quarter-finalist again at the Heineken Open in 2003 and 2004.\nAt Islamabad in 2004, Nielsen played the longest match in New Zealand's Davis Cup history, against Pakistan's Aisam Qureshi. The five set match lasted for five hours and 20 minutes.\nIn 2006, a sample that Nielsen had provided while playing the qualifying stages at the Australian Open, tested positive for finasteride, which can be used as a masking agent. An independent Anti-Doping Tribunal accepted Nielsen's claim that he took the product containing the positive substance to treat hair-loss, but found that by failing to check whether the hair-loss product contained such a substance indicated a \"serious dereliction of duty on the part of any player who participates in a sport governed by the WADA Code\". He was given a two-year suspension by the International Tennis Federation.\nThe ban effectively ended his career, but once the suspension ended he did briefly return to compete on the Futures circuit and he played a Davis Cup tie in Kuwait. That would be his 20th and final Davis Cup tie, a tally bettered only by Onny Parun. He finished with 25 Davis Cup wins to his name, from 43 rubbers. His 20 wins for New Zealand in singles also has him second all-time, to Onny Parun."

However, due to the proximity of the London Olympics, any athlete who was qualified for the Olympics would not take part in the European Championships. As the Olympic Trials were held less than a week before the European Championships, the complete team was not announced until 25 June 2012. However, automatically selected field athletes were permitted to compete, if the event complimented their training schedule. Reigning European champion, Mo Farah (5,000m), was given special dispensation to defend his title. However, reigning champions Jessica Ennis and Dai Greene were absent due to their Olympic selection and Philips Idowu was injured. Shana Cox and Christine Ohuruogu had qualified for the Olympics, and were taken as part of the relay team, and not permitted to participate individually. A number of high-profile athletes were also seeking Olympic selection following the Olympic trials. Many athletes who won, or finished second, at the Olympic trials, were requiring an Olympic 'A' Standard, to receive automatic selection.\nFinally, at the Championships, 73 athletes took part in the events."

        "text": "Wainuiomata Rugby Football Club (WRFC) is a rugby union club based in Wainuiomata, an outlying suburb of Lower Hutt, New Zealand.\nThe club was formed in 1946 during the significant settlement of the area in the post-war era; mostly by young families attracted by the affordable new housing on offer.\nThe club has since been through many ups and downs. The 1980s were particularly successful with the club winning many lower-grade titles. However following the 1987 season many players defected to the rival Wainuiomata Rugby League Club, with the club relegated from the Premier ranks the following season. The club would not return to Wellington's top flight until 2006.\nSince returning to the Swindale Shield Wainuiomata have won the Hardham Cup twice - in 2007 where they upset Oriental-Rongotai and again in 2010 when they defeated Avalon - and were runners-up to Upper Hutt in 2006 and Tawa in 2008. In 2011 the club qualified for the Jubilee Cup, finishing 7th, and qualified for the semi-finals in 2012.\nThe 2014 season was a stellar year for the club making its first appearance in the premier competition's Jubilee Cup Final against fierce local rivals, Hutt Old Boys-Marist. The fairytale season did not have a happy ending, going down in a tense final, 11-14.\nThe club has also enjoyed success with their second and third teams. The second side were promoted out of the Senior 2 competition in 2011 and retained their place in Senior 1 after the second round. In 2012 the second's qualified for the Hardham Cup as one of the top four eligible sides, where they finished 7th. The third side won the Senior 3 competition in 2012 and as eligible for promotion will play the 2013 year in the Senior 3 competition.\nThe club also fields Colts (U21), Under 85 kg restricted and Presidents grade (over 35's) sides at a senior level; and a large number of junior sides. The club maintains close links with Wainuiomata High School providing a pathway into senior rugby.\nThe club is based at William Jones Park which has an indoor training facility and a single field. Matches are also played at Mary Crowther Park a short distance away.\nPiri Weepu and Jonah Lomu are the club's two All Blacks in its history, Weepu regularly playing for the team when circumstances allowed him too. Jonah Lomu played for the club twice in 2000 and 2001 and also represented the club when donning its club socks when appearing for the Barbarian F.C. in 2000.\nJustin Va'a and Earl Va'a represented Manu Samoa including appearances at 2 Rugby World Cup tournaments. Uale Mai was a long serving stalwart for the very successful Samoa national rugby sevens team and was named IRB International Sevens Player of the Year in 2006.\nLocal boys Tana Umaga and Neemia Tialata both played their senior club rugby at neighbours Petone, mostly during the period when Wainuiomata were outside the Premier ranks."

He came from two sets down to beat John Horn in the second round and was then eliminated from the tournament by Belgium's Jacques Brichant. Another Belgian, Jacques Peten, beat Black in the first round of the 1954 Wimbledon Championships. Black reached the third round of Wimbledon again in 1956, with wins over Gerald Oakley and Oliver Prenn, the latter in five sets. He had four match points against Australian Ashley Cooper in the third round but lost the final set 7–9. The following year he returned to Wimbledon for what would be the final time and he lost in the first round, to Emilio Martinez.\nThe Rhodesian also competed twice at the French Championships. In 1956 he won his first round match against Ecuador's Wladimir Lerque, in five sets, then lost to fourth seed Art Larsen. He lost in the opening round of the 1963 French Championships to Abe Segal.\nFamily.\nBlack, who worked as a high school teacher after leaving tennis, was the father of Byron, Cara and Wayne Black, all professional tennis players.

The Bruins competed in the Pac-12 Conference and were led by head coach Ben Howland. Prior to the start of the season, the Bruins took a Goodwill Tour of China in late August. The Bruins reopened the newly renovated Pauley Pavilion on November 9, 2012 in front of a then record crowd of 13,513. On March 9, 2013, the Bruins clinched the regular season championship of the Pac-12 Conference by defeating Washington, 61–54, to finish conference play with a record of 13–5. They were seeded as the No. 1 team in the Pac-12 Conference tournament in Las Vegas. They were defeated by Oregon in the championship game. A week later, the Bruins were eliminated in the second round of the 2013 NCAA tournament by Minnesota 63–83 to finish the season 25–10.\nAfter the season, on March 25, 2013, coach Ben Howland was fired by UCLA.\nRecruiting class.\nThe Bruins also received a notable walk-on this season in the form of Spanish frontcourt project Adrià Gasol, the younger brother of NBA stars Pau and Marc.\nSeason.\nBefore the season's opening game, freshman Shabazz Muhammad was declared ineligible to participate by the NCAA. He was ruled to have received improper benefits for travel expenses and lodging during unofficial visits to Duke and North Carolina. After missing three games and an appeal by UCLA, he was reinstated, and his family was required to repay approximately $1,600. He scored 15 points off the bench in his debut in a 78–70 loss to Georgetown in the semifinals of the Legends Classic. Jordan Adams added 22 points in the game, extending his school record to four games of 20-point games by a freshman to start a season. Muhammad became a starter in the next game against Georgia, and he scored a game-high 21 points in a 60–56 win in the Classic's consolation game. The following game, UCLA led Cal Poly by 18 points with 12 minutes remaining before they were upset, 70–68. Earlier in the year, the Bruins needed overtime to defeat another Big West team, UC Irvine. UCLA dropped out of the AP Poll after being ranked No. 11.\nUCLA lost 78–69 in the John R. Wooden Classic to the San Diego State Aztecs, the Bruins' first ranked opponent of the year. Although it was a neutral-site game in nearby Anaheim, the crowd favored the Aztecs.\nUCLA won its next 10 games, including an upset win over #7 Missouri, before losing to No. 16 Oregon. It followed with an 84–73 road win over No. 6 Arizona behind Muhammad's game-high 23 points. After losing their next two games, to Arizona State and USC, the Bruins won seven of their final nine games, clinching the regular season Pac-12 title in their final regular season game, with a win over Washington in Seattle on March 9.

        "text": "The Major League Baseball Scouting Bureau is a centralized scouting resource that operates under the auspices of the Office of the Commissioner of Baseball. Headquartered in Ontario, California, the MLBSB's efforts supplement the independent, proprietary amateur and professional scouting operations of the 30 Major League Baseball clubs. In 2012, the MLBSB employed 34 full-time and 13 part-time scouts in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. In 2010, it announced plans to expand its activities beyond Puerto Rico to other countries in Latin America.\nAccording to MLB.com, the MLBSB's scouts \"provide information on amateur prospects as a part of its mission to support the efforts of MLB clubs in the First-Year Player Draft. The MLBSB also provides professional scouting services, including the collection of video footage of players throughout the professional ranks, both domestically and internationally.\" It maintains an eligibility file on amateur players — many of them teenagers — and holds 35 tryout camps each June in its countries of operation.\nThe current MLBSB was founded in 1974 by outgoing Milwaukee Brewers general manager Jim Wilson, and became part of the commissioner's office in 1985. However, its roots date to the founding by Major League owners of the Central Scouting Bureau in 1968, a period of time when many big league clubs were downsizing their scouting departments. The CSB's first director was Jim Fanning, former farm and scouting director of the Atlanta Braves. In August 1968, Fanning resigned after seven months with the CSB to become general manager of the expansion Montreal Expos. He was succeeded by former Chicago Cubs \"head coach\" Vedie Himsl for two years. Then, the CSB was temporarily dormant for almost four years until it was revived, as the MLBSB, by Wilson.\nFrom 1998–2014, the MLBSB was supervised by director, and then senior director, Frank Marcos. He announced his departure from the bureau in October 2014. He was succeeded by former Major League executive Bill Bavasi."

        "text": "Carl Allen Webster (born February 10, 1990) is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Boston Red Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs. He has also played for the Samsung Lions of the KBO League.\nProfessional career.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nWebster was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 18th round of the 2008 MLB Draft and began his career with the Gulf Coast Dodgers in 2008. In 2009, he played primarily with the Arizona League Dodgers and in 2010 was with the Great Lakes Loons where he was 12–9 with a 2.88 ERA in 26 appearances (23 starts) and stuck out 114 batters. In 2011, he started nine games for the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes and was 5–2 with a 2.33 ERA before a mid-season promotion to the AA Chattanooga Lookouts. In 2012, he made 22 starts for the Lookouts (and 5 relief appearances) with a 6–8 record and 3.55 ERA.\nBoston Red Sox.\nOn August 25, 2012, Webster was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with infielder Iván DeJesús, Jr., first baseman James Loney, and two players to be named later, in exchange for first baseman Adrián González, pitcher Josh Beckett, outfielder Carl Crawford, infielder Nick Punto, and $11 million. Eventually, pitcher Rubby De La Rosa and OF/1B Jerry Sands were the two players to complete the trade.\nEntering 2013, Webster was ranked as the fourth-best prospect in the Red Sox minor league system and ranked 71st in the MLB.com Top 100 Prospects list. The Red Sox added him to their 40-man roster and assigned him to the AAA Pawtucket Red Sox to start the season.\nThe Red Sox called him up to the Majors for the first time on April 21, 2013, to start the second game of a doubleheader. Webster was optioned the next day. Webster was recalled May 7 after reliever Joel Hanrahan went on the disabled list. Webster was optioned back to Pawtucket on May 9, and recalled on June 22. During his time in the Majors of the 2013 season, Webster made 8 appearances (7 starts) going 1–2 with an 8.60 ERA.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn December 12, 2014, the Red Sox traded Webster, Rubby De La Rosa, and Raymel Flores to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for Wade Miley. The 2015 season proved to be a difficult one for Webster. He was reported to have had shoulder fatigue in April. After struggling to the tune of an 8.18 ERA in AAA, Webster was called up to Arizona and made 5 starts while also appearing out of the bullpen four times. The Diamondbacks designated Webster for assignment after the season.\nSamsung Lions.\nOn November 25, 2015, Webster was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for cash considerations. He was released by the Pirates on December 16 and shortly afterwards signed a one-year contract with the Samsung Lions of the Korea Baseball Organization. He managed to start 12 games for the Lions, pitching to a 5.70 ERA.\nTexas Rangers.\nOn November 17, 2016, the Texas Rangers signed Webster to a minor league deal. He made 12 appearances (11 starts) for the Triple–A Round Rock Express, registering a 4–4 record and 6.79 ERA with 44 strikeouts across innings pitched. Webster elected free agency following the season on November 6, 2017.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn March 2, 2018, Webster signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs. Across three levels in Chicago's minor league system, Webster pitched to a 2.65 ERA in 17 games, and was called up to the Major Leagues on September 19 pitching in three games. He was non-tendered and became a free agent on November 30, 2018. On December 19, he re-signed to a minor league deal with the Cubs.\nWith the Cubs struggling at the start of the 2019 season Webster was called up to the majors to bolster the bullpen. In his first relief appearance for the Cubs on April 6, the first batter he faced, Milwaukee's Ryan Braun, hit a three-run homer. On May 11, Webster was put on the 10-day disabled list and later moved to the 60-day list. On July 3, he began rehabilitation assignments with the Cubs' rookie league team continuing on July 9 with the Tennessee Smokies (AA). He became a free agent following the 2019 season.\nWashington Nationals.\nOn March 9, 2020, Webster signed a minor league deal with the Washington Nationals. He was assigned to the Nationals' Double-A affiliate, the Harrisburg Senators. The Senators' 2020 schedule was canceled, along with that of every other Minor League Baseball team because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Webster was released on May 31, 2020."

        "text": "The 2012 Super Rugby final was played between the South African Sharks and the New Zealand Chiefs Super Rugby teams on 4 August 2012. It was the 17th final in the Southern Hemisphere's premier transnational club rugby competition's history and the second under the newly expanded 15-team format. The Chiefs had qualified second highest during the regular season, while the Sharks qualified as the sixth, and lowest, team. The Chiefs went straight to the semi-final, where they beat fellow New Zealand team the Crusaders. The Sharks travelled to Brisbane and beat the Queensland Reds in the qualifying final and then the Stormers back in South Africa in the semi-final. As the Chiefs had qualified higher than the Sharks the final was played at Waikato Stadium, Hamilton.\nIn part due to the level of travel the Sharks had to make during the finals series (travelling from South Africa to Australia, back to South Africa and then on to New Zealand in just three weeks) they entered the grand final as the underdogs. They started the stronger, however, and scored first points through a penalty. The Chiefs struck back, scoring a converted try and two penalties to lead 13–3 at half-time. They extended the lead in the second half, outscoring the Sharks with three more converted tries and a penalty to just the one penalty for the visitors. The Chiefs won the game with a final score of 37–6. It was the Chiefs' first victory in the competition from their second final. For the Sharks, it was their fourth final defeat.\nRoad to the final.\nThe 2012 Super Rugby competition involved fifteen teams, five each from South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. 2012 marked the 17th season of the competition, and the second in the expanded 15 team format (12 teams competed between 1996 and 2005, before increasing to 14 between 2006 and 2010). The competition began on 24 February with the regular season consisting of 120 matches over twenty one weeks. Each team played teams from their own country twice (home and a way) and four teams from each of the other two countries once (two at home and two away). The top six teams after the regular season would advance to the finals. Unlike previous years, there was a three-week break between Week 15 and Week 19 to allow the three countries to play international rugby against Northern Hemisphere teams.\nThe Stormers finished top of the South African conference and topped the overall standings, with just two losses (to the Crusaders and Sharks). The Chiefs won the New Zealand conference and finished second overall, losing four games in total (including the last two of the regular season to drop below the Stormers). As the two top finishers both teams advanced straight into home semi-finals. The Reds beat the Waratahs in their final game of the regular season to finished top of the Australian conference after the Brumbies lost to the Blues earlier in the round. Despite finishing on the lowest points overall of the six finalists they qualified third as the top Australian team. The Crusaders, Bulls and Sharks filled the remaining three places as the next top finishers during the regular season.\nThe Crusaders hosted the Bulls in Christchurch in the first qualifying final, while the Sharks traveled to Brisbane to play the Reds. The Crusaders eased passed the Bulls in the first qualifier, with All Black five eight Dan Carter scoring 23 points in their 28-13 victory. In Brisbane the Sharks upset the Reds in the second qualifier, leading 20-3 after 30 minutes and out defending the opposition to win with a final score of 30-17. The two semi-finals were local derbies, with the Sharks playing the Stormers in Cape Town and the Crusaders playing the Chiefs in Hamilton. Both games were much closer than the qualifiers. The Chiefs held out the Crusaders to win 20-17, while the Sharks had to withstand a late surge from the Stormers to win 26-19.\nBuild-up.\nThe Sharks entered the final as underdogs. Ladbrokes gave 2/1 odds to the Sharks compared to 4/9 for the Chiefs, while the TAB paid $3.10 for a Sharks win compared to $1.13 for a Chiefs win. The Sharks had to travel from South Africa to Australia, back to South Africa and then on to New Zealand during the final series. Former Springbok and current Brumbies coach Jake White believed this would make the task much harder for the Sharks. Prior to the final the two teams played each other fifteen times, with the Chiefs winning 8 of the encounters to the Sharks 7. During the regular season they met in Week 9 and the Chiefs won 18-12 in Durban. The Chiefs have only made the final once before, in 2009 when the Bulls beat them 61-17 in Pretoria (a record margin in Super Rugby finals). The Sharks had previously made three Super Rugby finals, losing all three to the Blues in 1996, the Brumbies in 2001 and the Bulls in 2007. The title has only been won by the visiting team four times (Crusaders in 1998, 1999 and 2000 and the Bulls in 2007) and only one of those occasions has been when traveling to a foreign country (when the Crusaders beat the Brumbies in Canberra in 2000).\nThe Sharks team broke up the flight to New Zealand by spending most of the week in Sydney before heading to Hamilton. Sharks centre Tim Whitehead was not available after he broke his hand in the semi-final, although previously injured utility backs Patrick Lambie and Paul Jordaan have both just recovered and played in the final. The Chiefs squad was the same that beat the Crusaders after in doubt captain Craig Clark recovered in time from a leg injury. Rugby journalist Spiro Zavos predicted that a key match-up would be between the two international centres, Sonny Bill Williams from the Chiefs and JP Pietersen from the Sharks. Steve Walsh, the referee of the Sharks vs Stormers game, was named to officiate the final. Walsh, a former New Zealand referee before joining the Australian conference in 2010, was controlling his second Super Rugby Final after refereeing the Bulls vs Sharks game in 2007. His assistants were Craig Joubert, the referee of the Chiefs vs Crusaders semi-final, and Keith Brown, with Garratt Williamson the video referee.\nThe 25,100 tickets for the final sold out three days before the game. Season members and sponsors purchased 8000 while the public bought the remaining tickets two hours after they went on sale. Big screens were erected for fans in Hamilton at Garden Place and on Hood Street.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe Chiefs won the game 37–6, scoring four tries to none, to claim their first Super Rugby title. The Sharks dominated the match early, scoring first points when Frédéric Michalak kicked a penalty after six minutes. The Chiefs worked their way back into the game, scoring the first try in the 19th minute. Andrew Horrell claimed an Aaron Cruden chip kick and after a Sonny Bill Williams break the ball was moved wide for Tim Nanai-Williams to score in the corner. Cruden converted the try and then kicked two more penalties after Jannie and Bismarck du Plessis infringed to have the Chiefs leading 13–3 at half time.\nThe Chiefs scored their second try early in the second half. After Michalak's clearing kick got charged down in goal number eight Kane Thompson drove over from the resulting five-metre scrum. The conversion from Cruden made the score 20–3 in favour of the Chiefs. Michalak kicked a second penalty with 30 minutes remaining to bring the Sharks within fourteen points, before Lelia Masaga claimed a mis-directed Sharks pass, resulting from a big Williams tackle, and outran the defence to score the Chiefs third try. The conversion gave the Chiefs a 27–6 lead going into the final quarter of the game. Cruden kicked one more penalty before Williams scored the fourth and final try in the last few minutes to give the Chiefs a convincing victory."

An undrafted free agent prior to 2012, Brown was signed and subsequently released by the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League (NFL) during the offseason, as was documented in the 2012 season of documentary television series \"Hard Knocks.\" Prior to joining the Dolphins, Brown was a finance student and college basketball player.\nHigh school and college.\nBrown attended Judge Memorial and Highland high schools in Salt Lake City, Utah, where he played basketball, football, and baseball. As a junior, Brown was an all-state wide receiver, leading the state of Utah in regular season TD receptions. Brown was recruited and had scholarship opportunities in all three sports, including invites at BYU, Oregon, and Washington State to play football. Brown made the decision to play basketball at Westminster College and pursue a degree in finance. Brown, a 6’4\", 190-pound shooting guard, played in 91 games over three years for the Griffins. In 2009, Brown accepted a Finance Internship in the Salt Lake City office of Huntsman Gay Global Capital, a private equity firm. He later returned to the firm's West Palm Beach office, but after seven months, he chose to go back to Utah to complete his finance degree.\nWhile checking out pro trainers to help his brother Braden, an offensive tackle at BYU, prepare for a possible future in the NFL, Brown met a trainer who opened his eyes to his own NFL potential. Trainer Chad Ikei, of Ikei Sports Hawaii, remained persistent and soon Brown chose to put his college education on hold and move to Oahu to train full-time with other NFL prospects. The news of postponing his degree for a second time stirred skepticism from many of Brown's friends. During a three-month boot camp that included a strict diet and three training sessions a day, six days a week, Brown bulked up to 240 pounds and cut his body fat in half.\nPro day.\nAfter signing with sports agent Michael Ballard of MB Sports, Brown participated in the pro-day at Brigham Young University on March 29, 2012, where he had the best numbers of any athlete at the event with his 39\" vertical leap, 10' 3\" broad jump, and 4.43-second 40-yard dash. After Brown's impressive showing, he received calls from the Philadelphia Eagles, New York Giants, Oakland Raiders, and Indianapolis Colts, with the Eagles, Green Bay Packers, and Miami Dolphins being the first teams to invite him to private workouts.\nProfessional career.\nMiami Dolphins.\nBefore he was able to participate in all of the workouts of the interested clubs, the Dolphins persuaded Brown to sign with them. Brown signed a three-year minimum deal, which included a signing bonus.\nHe was waived on August 23, 2012."

        "text": "Isabella, Three Sailing Ships and a Con Man (Italian title: \" Isabella, tre caravelle e un cacciaballe\") is a 1963 two-act play by Italian playwright Dario Fo, the recipient of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Literature. Some people got angry: Fo received threatening letters, was assaulted in Rome with Rame by Fascist groups who also threw rubbish at them, while another performance was disrupted by a bomb scare. He recounted this event in the prologue of \"Johan Padan and the Discovery of the Americas\".\nPlot summary.\nThe play is considered \"an attempt to demystify and debunk the traditional history-book image\" of Christopher Columbus. Fo said: \"I wanted to attack those Italian intellectuals who, with the centre-left and the Socialist Party in the government, had discovered power and its advantages and leapt on it like rats on a piece of cheese. I wanted to dismantle a character who had been embalmed as a hero in school history books, whereas he is in fact an intellectual who tries to keep afloat within the mechanisms of power, play games with the King and be cunning with power figures, only to end up reduced to a wretch.\"\n\"Isabella...\" is a play-within-a-play wherein an actor condemned to death (for performing the works of a banned author) is granted a last wish to perform one last play. He performs a history of Christopher Columbus, of which Roberto Rebora, writing in \"Sipario\" in 1963, says:\nThe play about Columbus presents the Genovese hero as an obsessive, wily individual, pitting his wits against Isabella, Filippo, Giovanna the madwoman, the (Spanish) court, sailing ships, enemies, a trial, and eventual obscurity, a consequence of the fact that cunning and unscrupulousness (even to honourable ends) is not enough if the powers that be are not on your side.' \nProduction history.\nThe play was first produced at the Teatro Odeon in Milan on 6 September 1963, in a production directed by Fo himself. It was later broadcast on RAI 2 in May 1977, and revived at the Centro Dramatico Nacional in Valencia, Spain in 1992 (again directed by Fo).\nTranslations.\nEd Emery has carried out an authorised English translation."

        "text": "A ground out is a method of putting out a batter in baseball. In such a play, a defensive player catches a batted ball hit on the ground by the batter and throws the ball to a defensive player at first base before the batter can successfully reach the base, or records an out elsewhere via a fielder's choice.\nMethod.\nA batter is grounded out when a ball hits the ground immediately after being batted, commonly an infielder catches the ball and then throws it to a defensive player at first base to complete the out. The out is completed when the player at first base either catches the ball while touching first base or tags the batter, in both cases, before the batter successfully reaches the base.\nDouble play.\nIf the defensive players put out one baserunner during the same play in which a batter grounds out, the defensive team records a \"double play\". There are other means of recording a double play that do not entail a ground out.\nTriple play.\nIf the defensive players put out two baserunners during the same play in which a batter grounds out, the defensive team records a \"triple play\", the maximum possible outs that can be recorded on a single play. There are other means of recording a triple play that do not entail a ground out."

Even though the equestrian proficiency badge has been included among the five essential badges a Scout must obtain to be subjected for the Scouts Awards, the activity has been set aside for the past few decades due to lack of facilities in the country.

He played for the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in the New South Wales Rugby League (NSWRL) competition.\nHe is the uncle of rugby league players Ian Thomson and Gary Thomson.\nCareer.\nPlaying.\nThomson, a tough forward from the Lakes United club in the Newcastle Rugby League, represented the district in a 14–7 win over the Parramatta Eels in the 1964 State Cup competition. He went on to play for the NSW Colts against the touring French team later that year. In 1966 he made the first of 8 appearances for New South Wales, and a year later made his test debut for Australia in a 22–13 win over New Zealand at the Sydney Cricket Ground. He was retained for the second test against New Zealand at Lang Park in Brisbane which saw a 35–22 win for the Australians.\nWhile still playing for Lakes United in Newcastle, Allan Thomson was selected for the 1967–68 Kangaroo Tour at the end of the 1967 season. He played in one test on the tour (his final appearance for Australia), a 16–13 loss to France at the Stade des Minimes in Toulouse, France. He also played in 13 minor games during the tour.\nThomson left Lakes at the end of the 1968 season and linked with NSWRFL club Manly-Warringah in 1969. He was a reserve in the Sea Eagles 23–12 loss to the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the 1970 NSWRFL Grand Final, and went on to play in Manly's first ever premiership win in 1972 when the Sea Eagles defeated Eastern Suburbs 19–14 in the Grand Final at the SCG, partnering Terry Randall in the Second-row.\nFollowing the Grand Final win, Thomson returned to Newcastle to once again play for Lakes United.\nCoaching.\nAllan Thomson returned to Manly as its first grade coach for the 1980 NSWRFL season. The Sea Eagles ended the 22 round season with an 11-9-2 record and a 6th-place finish, one spot out of the finals. During his coaching at Manly in 1980, Thomson coached 1972 Grand Final teammates Graham Eadie and Terry Randall. He was replaced in 1981 by former Manly player Ray Ritchie.\nThomson, who had represented Country Firsts six times as a player between 1965 and 1973, was appointed coach of the team in 1983. He coached Country in four of the annual City vs Country games from 1983 to 1986, but lost all four games to NSW City.\nDeath.\nAllan Thomson died on 26 September 2006."

Under the new format, the top 6 seeds earned a bye out of the first round while the 7 seed plays the 10 seed and the 8 seed plays the 9 seed. The first round, which began on a Thursday, aired on BYUtv.\nThe 8 teams that advanced to the second round had a bye on Friday while the women's second round was completed. The men's second round became the quarterfinal round. It took place on Saturday and had the 1 seed playing the winner of the 8/9 game and the 2 seed playing the winner of the 7/10 game. The quarterfinals also featured the 3 seed playing the 6 seed, and the 4 seed playing the 5 seed. The two evening quarterfinal games aired on ESPN2 while the afternoon games aired on BYUtv.\nContinuing a normal procedure for WCC men's and women's tournaments, no games were played on Sunday. All conference members were founded as faith-based schools, and all but Pacific are financially supported by churches. Most significantly, BYU has a strict policy against Sunday play. Instead, the four remaining teams had an off day and prepared for the semifinals on Monday.\nThe semifinals took place on Monday with the winner of 1/8/9 playing the winner of 4/5 and the winner of 2/7/10 playing the winner of 3/6. One of the semifinals aired on ESPN2, and the other aired on ESPN.\nThe championship took place on Tuesday and featured the semifinal winners.

        "text": "The 2012 Stony Brook Seawolves baseball team represented Stony Brook University in the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball season. The Seawolves were coached by 22nd-year head coach Matt Senk and played their home games at Joe Nathan Field. The Seawolves clinched their second consecutive regular season championship and their fourth America East Conference baseball tournament championship, earning the league's automatic bid to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament, their fourth appearance in school history.\nIn the NCAA tournament, the team went on to win the Coral Gables Regional. They then defeated LSU in the Baton Rouge Super Regional, becoming the first ever team from the America East Conference to advance to the College World Series, the first team from New York in thirty years, and the first team from the Northeast since 1986.\nSummary.\nRegular season.\nStony Brook opened their 2012 campaign with a perfect 4–0 weekend at Thibodaux, Louisiana, with pair of victories over Alabama State and Nicholls State in the Colonel Round Robin. The team then traveled to Greenville, North Carolina, to face off against East Carolina, where they were swept in three consecutive one-run games to drop their record to 4–3. They returned to the Northeast for a single game against Fairleigh Dickinson, routing the Knights at Teaneck, New Jersey. Stony Brook participated in the Dairy Queen Classic splitting the weekend against Kansas and host Minnesota, bringing their record to 7–5.\nStony Brook opened their home season on March 10 against Iona beating the Gaels 12–7. The Seawolves followed up beating the Yale Bulldogs three out of four in a weekend series and compiled a string of victories against Fordham and Columbia for their first five-win streak of the season. Stony Brook couldn't keep the pace and lost back-to-back games against Holy Cross but bounced back to win a pair of games against NYIT and victories against Marist and Fairleigh Dickinson, ending their non-conference slate at 17–8.\nThe Seawolves opened conference play against Binghamton, taking two of three at home. The team won two midweek non-conference games against Iona and Marist at home and then traveled to Albany for a weekend series; the Seawolves took three out of four. The team returned home to beat Rhode Island 8–2 and swept a four-game series against Hartford. Stony Brook played a pair of midweek non-conference games against Fairfield and Central Connecticut, coming out victorious on both occasions and swept a four-game series at UMBC, extending their winning streak to ten games and taking command of first place in the America East with a 34–10 overall record and 12–2 conference record.\nStony Brook took two out of three against Binghamton at home and swept a three-game series against UMBC to clinch a second consecutive regular season championship while going 21–2 at home. Stony Brook closed the regular season with a four-game sweep at conference rival Maine to win a program record 43 games. They ended the regular season with a 43–11 record, going 21–3 in the America East. The Seawolves headed into the conference tournament with the best winning percentage in Division I.\nAmerica East tournament.\nStony Brook earned a first-round bye in the America East tournament, hosted at Joe Nathan Field. Needing to win three games to earn the conference title, they defeated fourth-seeded Maine 14–6 and third-seeded Binghamton 7–4 to advance to the title game, where they met up with Maine again, defeating them 13–6 to advance to the 2012 NCAA Division I baseball tournament with a 46–11 record, the best record in Division I with an .807 winning percentage. The Seawolves were the first team in the America East since 2002 to earn both the regular season and conference tournament championships in the same season. For the first time in the history of the program, Stony Brook found itself ranked, sitting at #25 in the Baseball America poll and #29 in the NCBWA poll.\nCoral Gables Regional.\nStony Brook traveled to South Florida to play in the Coral Gables Regional as the fourth seed. In the first game the Seawolves knocked off top seeded Miami (FL) by a score of 10–2. The Hurricanes had not lost a regional home opener since 1978. After losing to UCF 9–8, the Seawolves entered the loser's bracket, where they defeated Missouri State 10–7, mounting a comeback after being down four runs in the seventh inning and striking out Luke Voit with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth to preserve the victory. This gave the Seawolves a spot in the regional championship, where they defeated UCF 12–5 and 10–6 in consecutive days to win the regional, advancing to face LSU in the Super Regionals.\nBaton Rouge Super Regional.\nIn the first game of the Baton Rouge Super Regional, LSU started freshman Aaron Nola while Stony Brook started sophomore Brandon McNitt. While Nola departed with a 2–0 deficit, the Tigers came back to tie in the bottom of the ninth on a solo shot by JaCoby Jones. Stony Brook put together leads in the top of the 10th and 11th innings, but LSU tied the game both times with solo home runs. A rain delay in the 12th inning postponed the game, set to restart at 10:05 a.m. on the next day. A single by Mason Katz in the bottom of the 12th gave LSU a 5–4 walk-off victory.\nIn game two of the Super Regional, LSU started Kevin Gausman, who had been drafted in the top 5 of the 2012 MLB Draft a week prior. Gausman had closed out game one earlier in the day. Stony Brook's senior pitcher Tyler Johnson threw a 127-pitch complete game as the Seawolves defeated the Tigers 3–1. In the winner-take-all game three, Stony Brook jumped out to an early lead and handily won 7–2 behind sophomore pitcher Frankie Vanderka's complete game. The improbable upset sent Stony Brook to the College World Series, the first Northeast school to do so since 1986 and the first school from New York to do so since St. John's in 1980.\nCollege World Series.\nAfter upsetting LSU in Baton Rouge, Stony Brook took on the motto \"Shock The World\" to represent their unlikely run to the College World Series. Stony Brook found itself ranked #7 in NCBWA poll, their highest ranking ever, and Matt Senk was later announced to be the National Coach of Year. In the College World Series, Stony Brook suffered consecutive losses, falling 9–1 to UCLA and 12–2 to Florida State to end the Seawolves' Cinderella run. They finished the season 52–15, the most wins by any Division I team in 2012, with a program record seven drafted players.\nSchedule.\n! style=\"\"|Regular season (43–11)\n! style=\"\" | Postseason (9–4)\nProfessional draftees.\nStony Brook had a program-record seven players drafted by Major League Baseball teams in the First-Year Player Draft. Travis Jankowski was selected in the supplemental first round, 44th overall by San Diego, Stony Brook's first ever first-round draftee. Pat Cantwell, who was drafted previously in 2011, was drafted in the third round by the Texas Rangers. Maxx Tissenbaum (11th Round, San Diego), William Carmona (11th Round, Philadelphia), James Campbell (12th Round, Los Angeles Dodgers), Jasvir Rakkar (26th Round, Chicago), and Tyler Johnson (33rd Round, Oakland) were also drafted and all signed professional contracts with their respective teams."

At the age of six, Coleman's family moved to Charlottesville, VA where he started riding. His first horse was a Shetland pony that arrived in the bed of a pickup truck. Coleman soon started riding in the hunt fields of Virginia Piedmont Hunt where he learned the fundamentals of horse back riding. His father was his first show jumping coach, being an avid fox hunter and horseman in his own right. As his love for eventing grew he started training with Olympic veterans Karen and David O’Connor regularly. After graduating from Woodberry Forest School in 2001, Coleman took an apprenticeship with the O’Connors.\nIn 2001 at the age of 18, Coleman was gold medalist at the North American Young Rider's Championship. When he turned 19 he moved up to the three-star level and finished 8th on his horse Second Hope at Fair Hill International CCI3*, earning a spot on the USEF's winter training list. In 2003, Coleman and Fox In Flight traveled abroad to the Bramham CCI3* where the combination won the under-25 Championships, becoming the only US combination to ever do so. The pair stayed in England to compete in their first CCI4* at Burghley where the pair jumped a clean cross country round and finished 26th out of more than 100 starters.\nAt the age of 20, Coleman was listed as a contender for a spot on the US Olympic team in Athens. Unfortunately Fox In Flight was injured right before Rolex Kentucky in the spring of 2004, putting him out of contention for the 2004 Olympics. However, Coleman had a second ride at Rolex Kentucky in 2004 on Second Hope. This would be his first attempt at Americas only four-star, where he finished as the top placed young rider.\nIn the Fall of 2005 Coleman began his college education at University of Virginia, leading to the sale of some of his top horses, leaving him with just a few young horses and Second Hope. At this time in his life he took a step back from completing to focus on his education. During his time away from competing he continued to focus on his riding education, taking lessons from many world famous riders such as Gerd Reuter in dressage, and Anne Kursinski and Wiljan Laraakers in show jumping.\nIn 2012 Will places fourth on Twizzel at Rolex Kentucky CCI4* and earned a spot on the team US London Olympic team.\nIn 2021, Coleman won the CHIO Aachen Nations Cup aboard Off the Record. He became the first American event rider to win in Aachen."

Julie Vlasto of France took silver. Kathleen McKane Godfree of Great Britain repeated as bronze medalist.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nFrance's Suzanne Lenglen was the reigning Olympic champion and the dominant player of the time; however, she was ill (battling jaundice) and could not compete in front of the home crowd. American Helen Wills (who would go on to replace Lenglen as the dominant women's player and win 19 total singles Grand Slam titles) was 18 at the time and had played in three Grand Slam tournaments to date, reaching the finals in all three (and winning the 1923 U.S. championship). Julie Vlasto was the top French player in Lenglen's absence.\nGreece, Hungary, India, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Spain each made their debut in the event. France and Great Britain each made their fourth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets."

He and his twin brother Fred attended East High School and came to their father's university to play basketball for coach Vadal Peterson in the fall of 1943. Due to the shortage of college-aged men associated with World War II, freshmen were eligible to play varsity basketball; freshmen did not become permanently eligible until 1973. \nKnown as the \"Blitz Kids,\" Lewis joined classmates Arnie Ferrin, Dick Smuin, and Herb Wilkinson to become the first champions in NCAA men's basketball history to feature four freshmen in the starting lineup.\nCareer.\nFollowing the championship season, the Lewis twins joined the Army for World War II. After their stint in the military, both Lewises moved to Stanford University to finish their academic careers. Bob Lewis played basketball for Stanford coach Everett Dean and played three years for the Indians. Lewis was noted as a strong defensive player during his time in Palo Alto. In addition to basketball, Lewis was a standout tennis player at Stanford.\nLewis graduated with an engineering degree, and went into a career in the aerospace industry.\nDeath.\nLewis died on April 11, 2012, at his home in Tucson, Arizona."

        "text": "The Open Era is the current era of professional tennis. It began in 1968 when the Grand Slam tournaments allowed professional players to compete with amateurs, ending the division that had persisted since the dawn of the sport in the 19th century. The first open tournament was the 1968 British Hard Court Championships held in April, followed by the inaugural open Grand Slam tournament, the 1968 French Open, a month later. Unless otherwise sourced, all records are based on data from the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the International Tennis Federation (ITF), and the official websites of the four Grand Slam tournaments. All rankings-related records are based on ATP rankings, which began in 1973. The names of active players appear in boldface."

        "text": "The Nationale 1 Hommes, officially named the Luxembourg Basketball League (LBBL), is the highest men's basketball league in Luxembourg. The league's governing body is Fédération Luxembourgeoise de Basketball (FLBB). The league was previously known by sponsorships names Diekirch League and Total League.\nAbout.\nAs the league is semi-professional, all clubs are run as not-for-profit. Each team in the league is allowed to have two American players on the roster. While most local players do not receive a salary, American players are paid.\nThere are two player statuses: JICL (French acronym for \"player registered with a Luxembourgish club\") and non-JICL. To be classified as JICL, a player has to have obtained a license from a FLBB club before their 16th birthday, or have one for at least three seasons between their 16th and 21st birthday. Prior to the 2013–14 season, each team was only allowed two non-JICL players, no exceptions. In July 2013, the European Commission adjudged the ruling was contrary to the Schengen Agreement. Following that decision, the rule was scrapped and replaced by a gentlemen's agreement to keep the number at two, though some have signed a third non-JICL player, arguing they were part-time players.\nFormat.\nDuring the regular season, each team plays the other nine teams twice, one at home and one away (10 teams, 18 games, 18 rounds). After this, the top six teams move on to the second stage, where they play a further 10 games against each other. The top four teams at the conclusion of the second stage move on to the playoffs. In the semi-finals, the No. 1 seed plays the No. 4 seed, and the No. 2 seed plays the No. 3 seed. The winner of each best-of-three semi-final moves on to the Finals series to decide the title (also best-of-three).\nMeanwhile, the bottom four teams after the regular season join the best four teams from the second-tier Nationale 2 to play for relegation and promotion respectively. The two worst ranked Nationale 1 teams are relegated whilst the two best Nationale 2 teams are promoted.\nEuropean competition.\nLuxembourgian clubs have not participated in European competition since 2002, the last year FIBA organised the FIBA Saporta Cup, with the FLBB bemoaning the separation between FIBA Europe and ULEB and the move away from a single-elimination format. Some of the requirements for participation in the FIBA-organised European third-tier EuroChallenge that restrict their participation are: a €5,000 registration fee notwithstanding other costs, an arena that seats at least 2000 without non-basketball lines, and games played on weekdays."

        "text": "Donald Adams Greenwood (February 18, 1921 – March 21, 1983) was an American football player and coach. He played professionally as a back for three seasons with the Cleveland Rams and the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League (NFL) and All-America Football Conference (AAFC).\nGreenwood played college football for the University of Missouri before transferring to the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where he starred as a halfback, punter and quarterback. His first year in professional football was with the NFL's Rams in 1945, when the team won the NFL championship. The Rams moved to Los Angeles after that year, however, and Greenwood elected to stay in Cleveland, where a new team called the Cleveland Browns was under formation in the AAFC. He played two seasons for the Browns, during both of which the team won the league championship. Greenwood was plagued by injuries in 1946, and in 1947 he suffered a debilitating cheekbone fracture that ended his professional career. After retiring, he worked as a high school coach in Ohio and briefly as an assistant at Yale University. In 1951, became the head football coach at Toledo University, but resigned from that position before completing his first season, saying the school had not done enough to counteract unnecessary violence in the game.\nEarly life and high school.\nGreenwood grew up in Kansas City, Missouri and attended Southwest High School. He played on the school's football team but was more accomplished as a track athlete. He won the Missouri state championship in 1938 by running the 100-yard dash in 10 seconds. In 1939, he was a member of an 880-yard relay team that won state and national championships.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, Greenwood enrolled at the University of Missouri in 1940 and played on the school's football team as a halfback who doubled as a punter. He also continued to run track, and set a school record of 6.2 seconds in the 60-yard dash.\nIn football, Greenwood became a star on strong Missouri teams in 1941 and 1942. The Missouri Tigers football team ended the 1941 season with an 8–2 record under head coach Don Faurot, winning the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association (Big Six) title and advancing to the Sugar Bowl against Fordham. Missouri lost the game after a punt by Greenwood in the first period was blocked, leading to a safety. The final score of the game, played on a muddy field, was 2–0.\nGreenwood entered the United States Army Air Corps in 1942 to serve in World War II, but he got a medical discharge in 1943 after he was injured in a plane crash. After leaving the air corps, Greenwood enrolled at the University of Illinois and played in 1943 and 1944 for the Illinois Fighting Illini football team. He played quarterback at Illinois, and threw five touchdowns in 1943. He played in an October 1944 game against a military team at Great Lakes Naval Training Station coached by Paul Brown that ended in a 26–26 tie.\nGreenwood also played baseball in college, mostly as a pitcher starting as a sophomore at Missouri in 1941. In his final year at Illinois he batted .415 against Big Ten Conference teams. He ultimately decided that he had better chances as a football player.\nProfessional career.\nGreenwood went undrafted in 1944 but signed late that year with the National Football League's Cleveland Rams. He came to Cleveland before the 1945 season and began an off-season job at Thompson Products Company in its engineering department. His college degree was in psychology, and he hoped to switch to personnel work. He also worked as an assistant to Edward McKeever at Cornell University before the season started. With the Rams, Greenwood was part of a potent offense led by quarterback Bob Waterfield. The team won the 1945 NFL Championship Game by a score of 15–14 in frigid conditions at Cleveland Municipal Stadium.\nOwner Dan Reeves moved the Rams to Los Angeles after the 1945 season, and Greenwood decided to stay in Cleveland and play for the Cleveland Browns, a team under formation in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and coached by Paul Brown. He was still under contract with the Rams, but he signed with the Browns after successfully arguing along with several other Rams players that he was not legally bound to play for a team not based in Cleveland. Before the 1946 season started, Greenwood was working in the personnel department of A.W. Hecker Company. He left the company, however, to take a job as the track coach at Western Reserve University in Cleveland.\nThe Browns won the AAFC championship in 1946, and Greenwood tied as the league's touchdown leader with six. Greenwood, who played halfback both on offense and defense, was plagued by injuries late in 1946 and into 1947. He had a broken cheekbone in 1947 that put him in the hospital for two weeks and kept him on the sidelines as the Browns won another AAFC championship.\nCoaching career.\nGreenwood began his coaching career in 1946 as the track coach of Western Reserve University, now known as Case Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, where he coached for one season. \nAfter the 1947 Browns season, Greenwood announced his retirement from football due to his cheekbone injury and accepted a job as head football coach at Cuyahoga Falls High School in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. Greenwood was hired as an assistant coach at Yale University in 1949. By 1951, he was the football coach at Toledo University in Toledo, Ohio. But he left that post the same year in protest of \"rough play\" during a game between Toledo and Bowling Green. He said football should be discontinued at the school until players could be protected and their safety ensured. He said he would give up coaching until the \"accent on win at any cost is abolished\". The cheekbone injury he sustained in an \"uncalled for collision\" in a 1947 game against the San Francisco 49ers helped prompt his decision, he said. He had three operations on the injury, and it had not completely healed."

At the AFA, Welch played the critical center position in coach Joe Scott's Princeton offense. Welch played a reserve role as a freshman, but was the catalyst of the team's attack as a sophomore in 2003–04.

At the conclusion of the season, Welch was named Mountain West Conference co-player of the year (with Rafael Araújo of Brigham Young) and an honorable mention All-American by the Associated Press.\nWelch played the following season for new coach Chris Mooney, averaging 12.0 points, 3.6 rebounds and 3.0 assists, but the Falcons missed postseason play. Welch suffered an ankle injury before what would have been his senior season. He was offered a medical turnback (the AFA did not grant traditional medical redshirts), and would resume his career in the 2006–07 season. As a senior, Welch averaged 9.9 points, 3.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game as he led the Falcons to the semifinals of the 2007 National Invitation Tournament.\nAfter graduating from the Air Force Academy, Welch fulfilled his service commitment, stationed at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana.

        "text": "The men's triathlon was one of the triathlon events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. It took place on 7 August 2012, featuring 55 men from 32 countries. It was the fourth appearance of an Olympic men's triathlon event since the first at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. The race was around Hyde Park, a 1.42 km2 park in central London. The race was held over the \"international distance\" (also called \"Olympic distance\") and consisted of swimming, road cycling, and road running.\nA group of six finished the swim leg in a lead group. Great Britain's Jonny Brownlee was given a 15-second penalty for an illegal transition between the swimming and cycling disciplines. A large lead group was together at the end of the cycling leg but Jonny Brownlee's brother Alistair Brownlee (Great Britain) broke away on the run to win the gold medal with Spain's Javier Gómez in second and Jonny Brownlee in third. Alistair Brownlee earned Great Britain's nineteenth gold medal at the 2012 Games.\nAlmost immediately after the race, bronze-medallist Jonny Brownlee collapsed due to heat stroke; it was confirmed he would suffer no permanent damage.\nQualification.\nQualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes. Once eight NOCs had qualified three athletes; a NOC was limited to two entries. A NOC with an athlete who won one of the five continental championships (Africa, Asia, Pan America, Europe and Oceania) were given one place in the event. Additionally, three places were available for the NOC of the medallists at the International Triathlon Union (ITU) World Qualification Event. Another 38 places were available to the NOCs with the highest ranked athletes on the ITU Olympic Qualification List on 31 May 2012. If an athlete had already qualified through another method the NOC did not receive another quota with it instead going to the next NOC on the ITU Olympic Qualification List. Five more entries into the event were given to one NOC per continental region. This was based on the ITU Olympic Qualification List with the highest ranked athlete from a non-qualified NOC in their continental region qualifying a place for their NOC in the event. One was given to the Great Britain NOC as the hosts but as they had already gained a place, the host place was given to the highest eligible athlete on the ITU Olympic Qualification List's NOC. The final two places for the event was given to two NOCs chosen by the Tripartite Commission.\nFor all qualification places the qualified NOC had the right to select any athlete who, by 31 May 2012, were in the top 140 of the ITU Olympic Qualification List, in the top 140 of the 2012 ITU World Triathlon Series or in the top 140 of the ITU Points List.\nPreview.\nAlistair and Jonny Brownlee were considered strong favourites before the race. The 2000 men's Olympic triathlon champion, Canadian Simon Whitfield, said that, \"If you run this Olympic race ten times, one of the Brownlee brothers will win nine out of ten times. But they won’t win it that 10th time, and you try to be that person to be there to capitalise on it that 10th time.” Among other contenders were Javier Gómez of Spain, who was the ITU Triathlon World Champion in both the 2008 World Championships and the 2010 World Championships; New Zealander Bevan Docherty; Whitfield of Canada and the 2008 Olympic champion Jan Frodeno from Germany.\nCourse.\nThe event was contested in Hyde Park in Central London, a park opened in 1637. The swim started on the north side of The Serpentine and the course was one lap. One of the female competitors, Laura Bennett, said that the swim was the hardest part of the course after competing in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course: “The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.” After the swim there was then a transition zone in front of the main grandstand. The competitors then started a bike leg consisting of seven laps. The cyclists first rode down Serpentine Road towards West Carriage Drive before changing direction and cycling to Hyde Park Corner. The course then quickly turned left towards Hyde Park to go past Buckingham Palace on Constitution Hill. Once passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclist turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossing through the transition area before starting the next lap. The final discipline was the run. It was four-laps of a loop around The Serpentine on flat ground.\nThe course was designed to be as spectator-friendly as possible. The athletes passed through the main grandstand area 12 times. The men's triathlon was one of the few events with free viewing points.\nRace.\nThe race started at 11:30 a.m. on 7 August 2012. Richard Varga led early in the swim and held the lead to come out of the water first. His swim leg split time was 16minutes and 56seconds, fourseconds faster than Javier Gómez and those two; along with both of the Brownlees, Ivan Vasiliev and Alessandro Fabian; formed a lead group of six that had an 11second gap over the rest of the field. At the transition between the running and cycling legs, Jonny Brownlee was given a 15second penalty for riding his bike before the transition zone. On the ride the race reformed with a 22-man strong group together for the majority of the discipline. Alistair Brownlee, aware of both his superiority in the run leg and the penalty facing his brother, put the hammer down from the very beginning of the run, aiming to crack the rest of the field and create a gap for himself and his brother. The senior Brownlee soon started to run away from the rest of the field with only his brother and Gómez attempting to follow him. Jonny Brownlee was dropped from the group at approximately halfway through the run and then Alistair Brownlee dropped Gómez with to go. Alistair Brownlee would go on to win the race in a time of onehour, 46minutes and 25seconds, beating Gómez by 11seconds. Despite having to serve his time penalty at the end of the second-last running lap, the brutal speed of the group of three worked as Jonny Brownlee held on to the bronze medal position, 20seconds behind Gómez but 18seconds in front of fourth-placed David Hauss of France.\nBronze-medallist Jonny Brownlee collapsed almost immediately after crossing the finish line. Paramedics gave him treatment and diagnosed heat stroke. He was taken to the medical tent where it was determined he would suffer no long-lasting effects.\nAlistair Brownlee criticised the penalty that he thought cost his brother the silver medal: \"I've never been a fan of these penalties, I think they're ruining the sport.\" Alistair also called the rules \"disgusting\" and accused triathlon organisers of \"ruining\" the sport."

        "text": "The women's triathlon was one of the triathlon events at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, United Kingdom. It took place on 4 August 2012, featuring 55 women from 31 countries. It was the fourth appearance of an Olympic women's triathlon event since the first at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. The race was around Hyde Park, a 1.42 km2 park in central London. The race was held over the \"international distance\" (also called \"Olympic distance\") and consisted of swimming, road cycling, and road running.\nA sub-twenty degree Celsius Serpentine River met the athletes in the swimming discipline. A group of seven finished the swim leg in a lead group. A couple of athletes crashed on the bike leg, including one of the pre-race favourites, Emma Moffatt of Australia. However, a large lead group of 22 athletes were together at the end of the cycling leg with an over a minute and a half over the rest of the field. A group of five athletes formed on the running leg; Nicola Spirig, Lisa Nordén, Erin Densham, Sarah Groff and Helen Jenkins and held together for most of the run. Jenkins (Great Britain) was dropped with two kilometres to go before Groff (United States) was dropped, also on the last lap. In the ensuing sprint finish Spirig (Switzerland) beat Nordén (Sweden) by 15 centimetres in a photo finish with both athletes recording the same time. Densham (Australia) finished two seconds behind Spirig to win the bronze medal with Groff fourth and Jenkins fifth. Switzerland became the first country to win the women's triathlon twice at the Olympics, with Spirig joining Brigitte McMahon (Sydney 2000) as an Olympic champion.\nNordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result of the photo finish in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) but their appeal was turned down and Spirig retained her gold medal.\nQualification.\nQualification for the race was restricted to three athletes per National Olympic Committee (NOC), an organisation representing a country at the Olympics, until eight NOCs had three qualified athletes.

In a preview written on the ITU website, Merryn Sherwood identified Jenkins, Moffatt, Densham, Spirig and Andrea Hewitt (New Zealand) as favourites. She wrote that she expected Lucy Hall (Great Britain), Hewitt and Densham to be strong on the swim leg along with a few other athletes. Sherwood thought that if that there was a large group of athletes together on the run then many of the competitors would fancy their chances at winning. Sherwood wrote, \"Most importantly every athlete will be going into the race knowing they have a chance.\" Sherwood's thoughts were similar to those of New Zealander Kate McIlroy who said, \"It’s funny, the women’s race seems at the moment there is probably 25 girls that could win it on the day.\" On the website \"Triathlete\" Courtney Baird said that the race favourites were Paula Findlay (Canada), Jenkins, Hewitt and Densham.\nMoffatt was the only athlete competing in the women's triathlon at the 2012 Olympics that had previously won an Olympic medal. She had won a bronze medal in the 2008 race in Beijing, China. Anja Dittmer was competing in her fourth Olympic triathlon, the only woman in the race doing so. The ITU World Triathlon Series champions of the four previous years in Jenkins (2008 &amp; 2011) and Moffatt (2009 &amp; 2010) were competing. Three countries had athletes competing for the first time in an Olympic triathlon. They were Ecuador (Elizabeth Bravo), Slovenia (Mateja Šimic) and Mauritius (Fabienne St Louis).\nDensham won the last ITU World Triathlon Series race before the 2012 Olympics in Hamburg, Germany. She beat Moffatt and Groff to win her second race of the 2012 Series. Hewitt was leading the World Series going into the Olympics.\nCourse.\nThe event was contested in Hyde Park in Central London, a park opened in 1637. The swim started on the north side of The Serpentine and the course was just one lap. After competing in the London leg of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series on the Olympic course Laura Bennett said that the swim was the hardest part of the course: “The swim was the most difficult, it was hard to get away from everyone.” Erin Densham said that: \"“The swim is going to play a big role. They have said before you can’t win the race in the swim but you can definitely lose it. Honestly there is no knowing how it’s going to go but it’s going to be hard and fast.\"After the swim there was then a transition zone in front of the main grandstand. The competitors then started a bike leg consisting of seven laps. The cyclists first rode down Serpentine Road towards West Carriage Drive before changing direction and cycling to Hyde Park Corner. The course then quickly turned left towards Hyde Park to go past Buckingham Palace on Constitution Hill. Once passing Buckingham Palace, the cyclists turned and went back towards Hyde Park and eventually crossed through the transition area before starting the next lap. The final discipline was the run. It was four-laps of a loop around The Serpentine on flat ground.\nThe course was designed to be as spectator-friendly as possible. The athletes passed through the main grandstand area 12 times. The women's triathlon was one of the few events with free viewing points.\nRace.\nThe race started at 9:00 a.m. British Summer Time on 4 August 2012. Lucy Hall, the youngest athlete in the race, led early in the swim and finished the swim leg first in a time of 18 minutes and 27 seconds. Hall led a group of seven; Line Jensen (Denmark), Mariko Adachi (Japan), Pâmella Oliveira (Brazil), Claudia Rivas (Mexico), Laura Bennett (United States) and Jessica Harrison (France); out of the water. The seven women had transition one (swimming to cycling) times of between 39 and 44 seconds.\nHall slowed the leading pack down so that her teammate Helen Jenkins could catch-up. The lead pack joined with the peloton at the end of the second cycling lap to form a 22-women strong group. Despite the chase group chasing hard, all 22 athletes finished the cycling leg in the same pack without any additions. There was a time difference of one minute and 44 seconds between the 22nd and 23rd athletes after the bike leg. The quickest individual bike split was shared between two New Zealanders, Andrea Hewitt and Kate McIlroy, who both completed the bike leg in one hour, five minutes and 26 seconds. Due to overnight rain the roads were wet and multiple athletes crashed on the bike leg. Two athletes in Kathy Tremblay (Canada) and Emma Moffatt had to withdraw from the race due to crashing. Moffatt, one of the pre-race favourites crashed on the first lap of the cycling leg. At the second transition (cycling to running) Anne Haug (Germany), who was in the second group, was the quickest through the transition in a time of 27 seconds. Of the leading group most went through in around 30 seconds.\nThe group quickly separated on the run leg and the lead group was down to eight athletes after one lap of the running course. They were Spirig, Nordén, Densham, Jenkins, Groff and Hewitt, Ainhoa Murúa (Spain) and Emma Jackson (Australia). Jackson was the first to get dropped and was followed by Groff and Murúa. The five remaining athletes finished the second run lap together. The group was then reduced to four when Hewitt was dropped. The American Groff then rejoined the group at the very start of the final run lap after being dropped earlier on in the race. In the ensuing sprint finish between Spirig, Nordén, Densham and Groff, Spirig pushed the pace and held off a fast-finishing Nordén to win by an estimated margin of 15 centimetres. Both athletes recorded a time one hour, 59 minutes and 48 seconds, and were separated by a photo finish. Densham finished two seconds behind Spirig to win bronze. Groff finished fourth with Jenkins fifth, Hewitt sixth, Murúa seventh and Jackson eighth.\nAfter the race, Nordén and the Swedish Olympic Committee appealed against the result in the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). The organisation turned down the appeal and Spirig retained the gold medal."

        "text": "The men's rings event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1928 Summer Olympics. It was one of seven gymnastics events for men and it was contested for the fourth time after 1896, 1904, and 1924. Scores from the rings event were added to the results from other individual apparatus events to give aggregate scores for the individual and team all-around events. Eighty-eight gymnasts from eleven nations competed, with each nation having a team of 8 gymnasts. The event was won by Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia, the nation's first medal in the rings event. For the second consecutive Games, Czechoslovakian gymnasts took both silver and bronze: Ladislav Vácha finished second and Emanuel Löffler is credited with a third place finish. Vácha, the bronze medalist in 1924, was the first man to win multiple medals in the event.\nLöffler's bronze medal may be the result of a math error. His scores in the compulsory and voluntary exercises were 27.25 and 28.25, respectively, which would result in a total score of 55.50. This score is consistent with the individual all-around and team all-around scores for Löffler and Czechoslovakia. However, his total score is listed as 56.50 instead in the Official Report for the rings apparatus. A score of 55.50 would have placed Löffler fourth in the rings, behind Italy's Romeo Neri at 56.00.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Six of the top 10 gymnasts from 1924 returned: bronze medalist Ladislav Vácha of Czechoslovakia, fourth-place finisher Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia, fifth-place finisher Bedřich Šupčík of Czechoslovakia, seventh-place finisher Jan Koutný of Czechoslovakia, eighth-place finisher Ferdinando Mandrini of Italy, and ninth-place finisher Vittorio Lucchetti of Italy. The 1926 world championship podium had Štukelj (who had also won in 1922), Vácha, and Šupčík atop it, in that order.\nThe Netherlands made its debut in the men's rings. Hungary competed for the first time since 1896. The other nine nations had all competed in 1924. The United States made its third appearance, most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nEach gymnast performed a compulsory exercise and a voluntary exercise. The maximum score for each exercise was 30 points. The rings was one of the apparatus used in the individual and team all-around scores. It accounted for of the score.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael"

        "text": "The men's vault (or \"jumps\") event was part of the gymnastics programme at the 1928 Summer Olympics held in Amsterdam. It was one of seven gymnastics events for men and it was contested for the fourth time after 1896, 1904, and 1924. Scores from the vault event were added to the results from other individual apparatus events to give aggregate scores for the individual and team all-around events. There were 85 competitors from 11 nations. Each nation had a team of 8 gymnasts; three of the 88 men did not start. The event was won by Eugen Mack of Switzerland, the nation's first victory in the event and first medal since 1896. Emanuel Löffler gave Czechoslovakia its second consecutive silver medal. Stane Derganc's bronze was Yugoslavia's first medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the fourth appearance of the event, which is one of the five apparatus events held every time there were apparatus events at the Summer Olympics (no apparatus events were held in 1900, 1908, 1912, or 1920). Six of the top 10 gymnasts from 1924 returned: gold medalist Frank Kriz of the United States, silver medalist Jan Koutný of Czechoslovakia, fourth-place finisher Leon Štukelj of Yugoslavia, sixth-place finisher Janez Porenta of Yugoslavia, seventh-place finisher Ferdinando Mandrini of Italy, and tenth-place finisher Ladislav Vácha of Czechoslovakia. The event was not held at the 1926 world championships and there was no clear favorite.\nThe Netherlands made its debut in the men's vault. Hungary competed for the first time since 1896. The other nine nations had all competed in 1924. Switzerland and the United States were each making their third appearance, tied for most of any nation.\nCompetition format.\nIn the early Olympics, the vault format changed considerably. For 1928, the vault competition consisted of two different jumps: one over a sideways (perpendicular to the approach) pommel horse and one of a lengthwise (parallel to the approach) over a vaulting horse (with no pommels). The pommel horse jump was of a set form while the gymnast could choose the skills to use for the vaulting horse jump. The combined score for the two jumps, of a maximum 30 points, was the result of the event.\nThe vault was one of the apparatus used in the individual and team all-around scores. It accounted for of the score, half of what the other apparatus counted (with the optional and compulsory components of the others counting for 30 points maximum each, rather than 30 points combined).\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael"

        "text": "Martin O'Donnell (born 4 June 1986) is an English professional snooker player. He gained a two-year place on the main snooker tour by coming through the 2012 Q School. He finished with the most points during the Q Tour of the 2022–23 season and gained a two-year tour card as a result. He is known as \"The Minister of Defence\" because his initials spell out \"MoD\" as reference to the UK government body responsible for the Armed Forces.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nAs an amateur, O'Donnell played in all 12 of the Players Tour Championship events during the 2010/2011 season. He reached the second round on three occasions, but could not progress any further, however, in Event 3 he defeated former world champion, Shaun Murphy 4–3.&lt;ref name=\"2010/11\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell finished 109th on the Order of Merit. He entered the 2011 Q School in an attempt to turn professional and in the final event he was one match away from achieving this. He played Kurt Maflin and lost 1–4.\nIn the 2011/2012 season, O'Donnell was again confined to entering the PTC events, playing 9 of the 12. He reached the main draw on six occasions but failed to win a match once there. He won the SnookerBacker Classic, which guaranteed him entry into Q School at the end of the season. O'Donnell won five matches at the first 2012 Q School event, concluding with a 4–1 victory over Adrian Ridley, to secure a two-year tour card beginning with the 2012/2013 season.\nProfessional debut.\nO'Donnell's first match as a professional was in qualifying for the Wuxi Classic. He beat David Grace 5–2, before losing to Alfie Burden 3–5.&lt;ref name=\"2012/13\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He went one better in qualifying for the next ranking event, the Australian Goldfields Open, by defeating Jeff Cundy and Grace once more, but was then whitewashed 0–5 by David Gilbert. He did not win two consecutive matches in qualifying for any other event this season.\nO'Donnell played in all ten minor-ranking Players Tour Championship events and did not win a match in any of them, until his final attempt at the European Tour Event 5 in Scotland. He saw off Sean O'Sullivan, Craig Steadman, Kurt Maflin all by 4–3 scorelines to reach the quarter-finals, but his run was ended as Andrew Higginson advanced with a 4–2 win. This helped O'Donnell to finish 83rd on the PTC Order of Merit. His season ended when he was beaten 5–10 by Tian Pengfei in the first round of World Championship Qualifying. O'Donnell finished his first year on the tour ranked world number 86.\n2013/2014 season.\nO'Donnell was beaten in the qualifying rounds for eight ranking events in the 2013/2014 season. All 128 players on the tour entered the UK Championship and Welsh Open at the first round stage, with O'Donnell losing at this stage in both.&lt;ref name=\"2013/14\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The only event he qualified for this season was the China Open by defeating David Gilbert 5–1. He received a bye through the first round due to Stuart Bingham's withdrawal which meant he would play in the last 32 of a ranking event for the first time. O'Donnell faced Craig Steadman and was edged out 5–4. In the European Tour events his best result came at the Rotterdam Open where he beat experienced players Robert Milkins and Marcus Campbell, before losing 4–0 to Stuart Bingham in the last 16. As he ended his second season at world number 92, outside the top 64 in the rankings, his other route to remain on tour next year was through the European Order of Merit, with eight places available to non-qualified players. O'Donnell finished 59th, less than 300 points short of Tony Drago who received the final spot and entered the 2014 Q School to retain his professional status. He was eliminated in the last 64 in both events and had amateur status for the coming season.\n2014/2015 season.\nO'Donnell qualified for the first round of three of the six European Tour events during the 2014/2015 season. His only win came at the first event, the Riga Open where he defeated Alfie Burden 4–2, but then lost 4–1 to Mark Williams in the second round. At the end of the season he won his place back on the tour by coming through three matches at the EBSA Play-offs, culminating with a 4–3 victory over Jamie Clarke.\n2015/2016 season.\nO'Donnell overcame Gerard Greene 6–4 to qualify for the International Championship and lost 6–2 to Neil Robertson in the first round.&lt;ref name=\"2015/16\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the first round of the Welsh Open he knocked out Stephen Maguire, making a 130 break along the way, but was then defeated 4–2 by Matthew Stevens. O'Donnell beat another multiple ranking event winner when he recovered from 3–1 down to Mark Williams to triumph 5–3 and qualify for the China Open. He then ousted Joe Swail 5–2 and Matthew Selt 5–1 to reach the last 16 of a ranking event for the first time, but he was thrashed 5–0 by Mark King.\n2016/2017 season.\nO'Donnell qualified for the Riga Masters and beat Sam Craigie 4–3, before losing 4–3 to Jimmy Robertson. He had to wait until the penultimate event of the year to reach the last 32 again as he qualified for the China Open by edging past Thepchaiya Un-Nooh 5–4 and thrashed Jimmy Robertson 5–0. O'Donnell would be defeated 5–1 by Mark Selby and played in the 2017 Q School as he was ranked 74th in the world, outside the top 64 who kept their places. He lost 4–1 to Lukas Kleckers in the last round of the first event and 4–3 to Ashley Carty in the third round of the second, but took the final place through the Q School Order of Merit to earn a new two-year tour card."

        "text": "Major League Baseball 2K5 (MLB 2K5) is an MLB licensed baseball simulation video game published by 2K. \"MLB 2K5\" is available for PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The previous game in the series made by Sega Sports was ESPN Major League Baseball back in 2004. Unlike the other \"2K5\" branded sports games, this was published by 2K, making it the first Visual Concepts-developed sports game not to be published by Sega, though Sega's logos are still seen in the background of menus and ballparks. (These logos and the ESPN Graphics would be removed and replaced by 2K's logos in the World Series Edition) The game included Web Gems instant replays, K-Zone pitching, Slam Zone hitting, and baserunner mode. The game was released in late February 2005 on the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles. The cover baseball player was New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter. Later that year, an upgraded version titled Major League Baseball 2K5: World Series Edition was released during the 2005 MLB postseason.\nCommentators.\nThe commentary is delivered by the ESPN Sunday Night Baseball crew of Jon Miller and Joe Morgan. Karl Ravech introduces the games from the studio.\nFeatures.\nExhibition: Play against the computer or head-to-head with another player.\nFranchise: Play multiple seasons with a team.\nGM Career Mode: Become a team's GM and try to accomplish certain goals given by the owner while building a good team.\nOnline: \"MLB 2K5\"s online mode includes both games and online leagues.\nReception.\n\"MLB 2K5\".\nThe game received \"favorable\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. GameSpot said that \"what sets MLB 2K5 apart from other baseball video games is how great it looks and sounds ... Major League Baseball 2K5 is a big step in the right direction for Take-Two's (formerly Sega's) video game baseball franchise. Last year's game, to be kind, was full of bugs and had modes that didn't actually work as advertised. All of the modes in this year's game work like they should and there seem to be hardly any bugs, although the few you will probably run across do have the potential to be very annoying.\" IGN wrote that \"MLB 2K5 still has a ways to go if it intends to compete with the memory of MVP next year. The animations need a complete overhaul, the AI definitely needs a reworking, and the Franchise Mode has to see significant innovation outside of a nicer interface\", but that overall \"MLB 2K5 is a great experience worthy of a spot on your shelf.\"\n\"World Series Edition\".\nThe \"World Series Edition\" received \"generally favorable reviews\" on both platforms, a bit higher than the original \"MLB 2K5\", but both a few points shy of \"universal acclaim\", according to Metacritic. During the 9th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated \"MLB 2K5: World Series Edition\" for \"Sports Game of the Year\", which was ultimately awarded to \"SSX On Tour\".\nExclusive license.\nIn 2005, in response to EA Sports' exclusive license with the National Football League and ESPN prohibiting any NFL 2K games for the foreseeable future, Take-Two Interactive signed an exclusive third-party licensing contract with Major League Baseball (MLB), MLBPA and MLBAM to produce MLB games. The agreement, which ran from Spring 2006 to 2012, allowed for the console manufacturers Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo to produce MLB titles for their respective platforms, but barred third party developers such as EA Sports from continuing or developing their own MLB games."

The league consisted of a merger of three independent leagues, the Northern League of Illinois, United League Baseball of Texas, and the Golden Baseball League based in the Western United States and Western Canada and was a last-ditch effort to save the teams in said league. The league's chairman of the board was Dave Kaval, former CEO of Diamond Sports and Entertainment (owners of the now-defunct GBL), league president was Brian MacInnes and main board member was James C. Peters.\nAfter playing two seasons, the North American League folded.\nTravel issues and division alignment.\nTo keep travel costs from being a financial issue for the teams, in 2011 the league played in a division structure where teams played 75% of their 96-game schedule within their division and made just one lengthy roadtrip of 12 games outside their division. The season concluded with divisional playoffs followed by a North American Championship Series.\nAs of the 2012 season there was no inter division play. The North and United played all games within their own division. The only play outside the division was supposed to be a 3 out of 5 games for the North American Baseball League championship. The United Division refused to play a championship series.\nThe 2012 United Division championship series saw the Edinburg Roadrunners defeating the Fort Worth Cats, three games to none. In the North Division championship series, the San Rafael Pacifics topped Na Koa Ikaika Maui, two games to one.\nLevel of play.\nThe roster rules allowed all teams to keep their existing players from 2010. The three predecessor leagues had contracts of 35 players purchased by Major League organizations in 2010. In addition, these three leagues placed half of the prospects on the Baseball America Top Indy Prospects List and six of the 14 players on the 2010 Baseball America All-Indy First Team.\nDownfall of the league.\nOn March 27, 2012, it was announced that Diamond Sports &amp; Entertainment walked away as management of the league. As the 2012 season came to a close, the league finally folded due to financial instability and franchises withdrawing from the league."

It has occupied its current site on the Lane Cove River at Yacht Bay, Longueville since 1933. The club has a focus on masters, juniors and social rowing. The club conducts an annual corporate regatta and a learn-to-row program.\nHistory.\nSir George Dibbs, a three-time Premier of New South Wales was one of the instigators of a public meeting held in July 1879 at Milsons Point to consider the prospects of establishing a rowing club on Sydney harbour's north side. The following month at the School of Arts in St Leonards a committee was elected and an enrolment program for members was commenced.\nThe club was the fourth senior rowing club to be formed in Sydney with only the Sydney, Mercantile and Glebe clubs in existence when North Shore came into being in 1879.\nThe first boatshed was built on the western side of Careening Cove at the bottom of Willoughby Street and an opening ceremony took place on Saturday 15 November 1879, when a Regatta was held. The club met opposition from a local government member regarding the site it had secured and in 1890 voluntarily vacated the Willoughby Street site and moved the clubhouse to the opposite side of Careening Cove where a Mr. John Wilson owned a water frontage. By 1894, the club had 113 members and 14 boats and was considering a new and more ample boathouse site.\nA third location was secured in 1903 at the head of Careening Cove after the Committee negotiated a lease with the Harbour Trust. The shed was built that same year, a 65 ft by 50 ft two-storied structure, roughly twice as big as the old shed. Ferry traffic, choppy water and the site's exposure to Sydney's southerly winds made the site less than ideal for preparing racing crews and in 1929 the club built a branch clubhouse and training facility at its current location just above Longueville Wharf on the Lane Cove River. All the club's activities were transferred to this shed in 1937 and it has operated from there since.\nMembers.\nOlympic representative members include:\nNotable past members include:"

        "text": "Alfredo Luis Escalera Maldonado (born February 17, 1995) also known as Alfredo Escalera and Alfredo Escalera–Maldonado is a Puerto Rican baseball outfielder who is a free agent. The Kansas City Royals drafted Escalera out of high school in the eighth round of the 2012 MLB Draft. making him the youngest player to be drafted since the inception of the First-Year Players Draft in 1965. Escalera was born in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico where his baseball abilities were noted at an early age, and later moved to Bradenton, Florida to enhance his training. Escalera debuted in his first professional game with the Arizona League Royals only two weeks after signing his multi-year contract.\nEarly life.\nEscalera was born in the Santurce section of the Puerto Rico Capital City, San Juan. When he was four years old, Escalera started playing baseball. In 2008 his parents moved to Florida to provide him with better development opportunities. His father, Alfredo L. Escalera, MD, an internal medicine physician, met his mother, Nancy, a New York nurse of Hispanic descent while undergoing his medical training in the Long Island College Hospital. The Escaleras moved to Puerto Rico where they established their residence as well as a considerable healthcare practice which included a medical group practice, a nursing home and a healthcare consulting firm. Escalera's younger sister Gabriela has become one of her brother's closest advisors and is closely involved in his professional career.\nThe Escalera family has a strong baseball tradition. Escalera's uncle Nino Escalera played for the Cincinnati Reds and his cousin Ruben Escalera for the Milwaukee Brewers. Both worked as scouts and professional team managers in their post-playing careers.\nEscalera was exposed to baseball at the age of four when he joined the Encantada Baseball Club in Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico. He later transferred to the Roosevelt Baseball Club in search of a more instructional environment. Between the ages 9 and 12, Escalera participated in the internationally regarded IMG Academy Baseball Camp in Bradenton, Florida. IMG's Program Director, Ken Bolek, later invited Escalera to join IMG as a full-time student-athlete. Escalera joined the IMG Academy in 2008.\nHigh school.\nDuring Escalera's high school career he participated in over two hundred IMG scrimmage and spring games as well as several workouts, showcases, and tournaments across the United States and Puerto Rico. Escalera mainly played for the IMG Royals but during the summer he joined the Puerto Rico Rookie Palomino Team (2010) and the Miami Bombers (2011).\nAt IMG, Escalera was honored with the 2011 IMG's Batting Champion Award after accumulating 25 RBIs in 19 games with a batting average of .500. During his senior year, Escalera maintained a batting average of .377 with a flawless defense in a 25-game season. Escalera also had three walk off hits during his senior year ending the games in victory for his team, two of them while playing in the Sarasota Classic (Elite Division) and a walk off home run in the championship game.\nEscalera's baseball talents drew a significant attention form several NCAA Division 1 colleges. While still in his junior year, Escalera verbally committed to attend Florida State University (FSU). Just prior to the National Letter of Intent signing day, Escalera, determined not to join the FSU Seminoles and instead signed a Letter of Intent to attend Stetson University's business school where he was expected to be the starting centerfielder for the Stetson's Hatters Baseball Team. Escalera's signing was met with enthusiasm by the Hatters team. \"Alfredo is an extremely athletic student-athlete and has the ability to play any outfield or infield position. He has game-changing speed and a very good bat that projects to have some power at the Division I level. We are very excited to have Alfredo becoming a Hatter as he rounds out this already impressive class.\" stated Stetson's Baseball Head Coach Pete Dunn.\nProfessional career.\nPlayer profile.\nThe IMG Academy experience propelled Escalera's early talent into a solid professional skills player with good knowledge of the game. According to the former MLB Coach and IMG Director, Ken Bolek, Escalera had a high degree of overall athleticism, with above-average speed, arm strength, and bat speed, as well as very good overall action. Escalera also runs the 60 yard dash in 6.2 seconds making him a valuable base runner. Escalera's skills were nationally ranked and evaluated by Perfect Game, Baseball Factory and Prospect Wire; he was considered to be one of the most consistent and reliable baseball players of the 2012 rookie crop.\nOffensively, Escalera can produce real power out of his thin frame. However, in addition to his offensive skills – bat speed, quick hands, low-tension swing – the general consensus is that on defense Escalera has a smooth easy action to the ball, remarkably quick feet and soft hands. His solid arm strength (91 MPH) supports his fielding skills. Perfect Game Scouting Report described Escalera as having a very smooth action, lots of arm strength, on line accurate throws, sound fundamentals and long infield actions that may lead to the third baseman position in the future but he has the tools to play any of the outfield positions.\nDuring his high school senior year Escalera was scouted by eighteen Major League Baseball (MLB) organizations. He caught the attention of the professional southeast scouting staff who were regulars in Escalera's high school baseball games and workouts. \"\"Escalera is one of the most interesting prospects to watch leading up to the draft\" stated the sports expert Mack Ade.\nKansas City Royals scout Alex Mesa, comprehensively evaluated Escalera's performance prior to the 2012 draft and developed a close relation with Escalera and his family. Mesa lobbied the Royals’ management team and later got support from Paul Gibson and Lonnie Goldberg, National Cross-Checker and Director of Scouting respectively. The Royals consistent draft philosophy has been to get the best talent available on the board. Mesa successfully argued that Escalera's ability and work ethic fit that philosophy perfectly.\nOn draft day, Escalera was selected as the Kansas City Royals 8th pick, becoming the youngest player to be drafted since the inception of the draft in 1965. After negotiating the terms of his contract and signing an agreement, Escalera was sent to the AZL Royals in Surprise, Arizona.\nAfter a month with the AZL Royals Escalera was able to adjust and contribute to his team's success. Escalera's participation in the AZL League has generated enthusiastic responses from his teammates, fans and coaches. \"Combine Escalera's youth, glimpse of hitting talent, arm and speed and the Royals could have a true diamond in the rough\"\" stated sports analyst Zach Mortimer.\nEscalera was assigned by the Kansas City Royals to join the affiliate Burlington Royals in North Carolina during the 2013 baseball season after having a strong spring training showing. During the season, Escalera endured some minor challenges including a left thigh muscle strain. Despite this, Escalera ended his 2013 season as the Burlington Royals Team's leader in hits, doubles and batting average among the players in the team's final roster with more than 150 season's at bats. Escalera made the Top 20 2013 Appalachian League's batting average list.\nAfter the 2014 Spring Training session, the Royals organization assigned Escalera to the Kansas City Royals affiliate Lexington Legends in Kentucky.\nPhilanthropic activities.\nEscalera has shown a commitment with participating and supporting altruistic events organized to improve the quality of live of the homeless population as well as underprivileged kids. During his recurrent outings to the Royals’ training camp in Surprise Arizona, Escalera has gotten involved in many humanitarian activities mostly related with assisting kids to get motivated to succeed in life. In October 2012, the Extra Innings Foundation awarded Escalera with the Player of the Month Award, for his continued support to the development of young children in the Arizona underprivileged communities. Later that year, Escalera headed an activity to raise funds for UNICEF's United States Fund to promote world access to clean water. He turned over a $25,000 check to the Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock, in the presence of Secretary of State-designate David Bernier and Secretary-designate of Sports and Recreation Ramón Orta. In April 2013, during the National Volunteer Week, President Obama's Administration awarded Escalera with the President's Volunteer Service Award the nation's most distinguished service awards in the United States. During the 2014 Spring Training, the Royal's front office, teammates and coaches awarded Escalera the 2014 Mike Sweeney Award for exemplifying Royals' values on and off the field "

        "text": "Mike Nesbitt is an American college football coach and former player. He is the head football coach for Ottawa University in Surprise, Arizona, a position he has held since 2018. He served as the head football coach at West Texas A&amp;M University from 2013 to 2016, compiling a record of 25–17. Nesbitt was the offensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars football team at the University of Houston at the start of the 2012 college football season. He previously served as the offensive coordinator at Stephen F. Austin State University, West Texas A&amp;M, and Blinn College. His 2006 Blinn team won the NJCAA national championship, and his 2010 West Texas A&amp;M team ranked second in the nation with an average of 529 yards per game in total offense.\nPlaying career.\nNesbitt grew up in Belen, New Mexico, and played college football as a punter under head coach Dennis Franchione for the New Mexico Lobos. He averaged 45 yards a punt as a junior, the second highest in New Mexico school history. And as a senior, he \"led the nation in net punting.\"\nAfter his college career, Nesbitt pursued a career in professional football. In June 1994, he signed a contract to play professional football for the New Orleans Saints. He was cut by the Saints in late August 1994. The following year, he was re-signed by the Saints in March 1995. He was again cut by the team in late August before the start of the regular season.\nIn February 1996, he signed with the Minnesota Vikings. He was released before the start of the regular season.\nCoaching career.\nNesbitt was as a head football coach at the high school level, including stints at his alma mater, Belen High School, and at Albuquerque, New Mexico's Manzano High School.\nIn June 2001, Nesbitt left his position at Manzano High School to become the running backs and kicking coach at Howard Payne University in Brownwood, Texas. After four years at Howard Payne Nesbitt accepted a post as the offensive coordinator at Blinn College in Brenham, Texas. At Blinn, he worked under head coach Brad Franchione, the son of Dennis Franchione who had been Nesbitt's college coach. During Nesbitt's two seasons at Blinn, the team compiled a 19–3 record and won the NJCAA national championship.\nFrom 2007 to 2010, he was an assistant coach at West Texas A&amp;M. After three seasons as the quarterbacks coach, he became the offensive coordinator in 2010. During the 2010 season, Nesbitt's offense was ranked as #2 in the nation with an average of 529 yards per game in total offense and #4 in scoring offense with an average of 42 points per game.\nIn January 2011, Nesbitt became the offensive coordinator at Stephen F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, Texas. He spent only one year at Stephen H. Austin.\nIn January 2012, Nesbitt was hired as the offensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars football team under head coach Tony Levine. His work with offense received favorable coverage during the spring and summer months. However, after a 30–13 loss to Texas State in Houston's season opener, Nesbitt resigned his position as offensive coordinator. The \"Houston Chronicle\" reported that Nesbitt was \"forced to resign . . . in the wake of a stunning season-opening loss to Texas State.\""

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Steve Waugh",
        "text": "Steve Waugh is a former cricketer and captain of the Australia cricket team. He is a right-handed middle order batsman and a right-arm medium bowler. Described as one of the most consistent batsmen, and by Indian cricketer Rahul Dravid as \"a gritty player who did not throw away his wicket easily and is someone who valued his wicket\", Waugh scored centuries (scores of 100 or more) in both Test and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). During his career in international cricket he scored centuries on 35 occasions and half centuries on 95 occasions. Considered to be one of the greatest modern day cricket captains, Waugh led Australia to 41 wins out of the 57 Test matches under his captaincy. \"He was named Cricketer of the Year in 1988 by \"Indian Cricket\", and a year later by \"Wisden\". In January 2010, the ICC inducted him into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.\nWaugh made his Test debut against India in December 1985, and scored a century for the first time in a match against England in 1989 which Australia won. In Test matches, Waugh has scored centuries against all Test cricket playing nations, the second player to do so. He has scored a century in at least one cricket ground of all Test cricket playing nations, except Sri Lanka and Bangladesh. He has made scores of 150-plus in an innings on 14 occasions. His career best score of 200—his only double century—came against West Indies in April 1995. Waugh has been most successful against England, scoring ten centuries against them, the first in 1989 and the last one in 2003. On 25 July 2003 he became the first player to score 150 runs in an innings against all Test-playing nations, a world record. He has been dismissed eight times between scores of 90 and 99, with a further two innings not out in the 90s. As of August 2015, Waugh is ninth in the list of leading century makers in Test cricket.\nAlthough he made his ODI debut in January 1986, it was not until 1996 that Waugh scored his first century, when he made 102 against Sri Lanka in a match which Australia lost. He went on to score centuries on two more occasions until the end of his career. His highest score of 120 came against South Africa during the 1999 Cricket World Cup; the innings ensured Australia's victory and earned him a Man of the match award. Having played for Australia for nineteen years, Waugh retired from international cricket after the final Test of the 2003–04 series against India."

        "title": "Leichhardt Rowing Club",
        "text": "Leichhardt Rowing Club formed in 1886 is one of the oldest rowing clubs in Sydney, Australia. The clubhouse has occupied sites on Port Jackson's, Iron Cove at Leichhardt since 1886. Leichhardt is an all-level competitive and recreational rowing club, with a long history of supporting women's rowing. The club has enjoyed a rebirth in the new millennium partly due to the success of its Masters, Corporate Challenge and learn-to-row programs as well as a cherished partnership with Pymble Ladies College.\nHistory.\nS.G Davison, the Mayor of Leichhardt presided over a public meeting at the Leichhardt Council Chambers on 29 May 1886 which was called for the purpose of forming a rowing club. Permission was obtained from the Crown for the Leichhardt Park Trustees to permit the use of water frontage for baths and rowing club sheds through the efforts of Solomon Hyam MLA. After a boatshed was built, Sir Henry Parkes, Premier of New South Wales formally opened the new club at a ceremony on 24 September 1887 before the largest group of people ever assembled on Leichhardt Park. The club was established free from the pressure of the amateur principle in place at Sydney and Mercantile. It was for both \"manual labourers\" and \"brain toilers\" and Parkes, who described rowing as \"a healthy, beautiful and manly exercise\", expressed his approval of the club's democratic principle regarding membership.\nThe club took delivery of its first boat – a single skiff – in late 1887. Life membership subscriptions paid by some of the foundation directors were used to fund a few further skiff purchases. Leichhardt was admitted to the New South Wales Rowing Association in March 1893. A severe storm fully destroyed the club and its fleet of boats in 1897 but rebuilding and replacement was fully complete by 1900. The club's initial racing colours were buff and blue but by 1902 club equipment was being painted in red and blue, the club's livery ever since.\nHenry Hauenstein was the club's first selected Olympic competitor, rowing in the men's eight at Stockholm 1912. He had regularly appeared in the New South Wales state eight since 1907.\nOver 100 club members left to see active service in World War I and a number fell. After the armistice Hauenstein and fellow club-member Tom McGill rowed (along with Middleton of the Sydney Rowing Club) in the victorious AIF crew at Royal Peace Regatta who won the cup for eight-oared boats presented by King George V. In time, the King's Cup, became the trophy presented to the winning men's eight at the annual Australian Rowing Championships.\nAt the commencement of World War II the club had 40 active members. By the war's end 90 club members had served in the forces. The Australian Military Forces occupied the park, foreshore and clubhouse from 1943 and the boats were rehoused at the neighbouring Haberfield Rowing Club.\nLeichhardt Rowing Club began co-operating with nearby ladies rowing clubs from about 1910. Women began rowing for the club in the 1950s. In 1976 the club constitution was changed to admit women as constitutional members.\nThe 1950s was a golden era for the club. Leichhardt won the Sydney premiership four times, including a hat trick, was runner-up four other times and third in the other two years. Four club men were selected for Olympic representation at Helsinki 1952 and five for Melbourne 1956.Although rowing no longer is part of the Empire/Commonwealth Games, there was one representative in 1950, four in 1954 (Canada), and eight in 1958 (Wales). The 1950s also produced a small but successful squad of Australian Championship women in four oared events with Lionel Robberds A.M.Q.C as both coxswain and coach.\nBy 1976, the club constitution was amended to include women. Len Macpherson, club life member from 1961, recruited students from neighboring schools and by 1980 had achieved state and national success with representation at New Zealand and the Royal Canadian Henley. The mid-1980's with Michael (Mick) Lowrey as coach, achieved similar outcomes with students from Sydney Girls High School. In 1980, the administration of women's rowing in NSW was transferred to the New South Wales Rowing Association (NSWRA) and with that, the formal development of girls’ college rowing. Coach Lowrey was awarded Coach of the Year by the NSWRA for the 1990 – 1991 season. At one stage, women club members held both the national open and lightweight scull championship simultaneously. By 1994, Gillian Campbell, the first female club captain and 1992 Olympian, had been a sports mistress at Pymble Ladies College. Rowing was introduced to the college sports program and on an initiative by the college principal, Gillian Moore A.O, a strong partnership has been of great benefit to students, members and both parties since the late 1990s.\nThe new millennium has introduced increased participation for both men and women in masters rowing whilst maintaining its junior development program. Club administration is dependent upon the voluntary efforts of the executive and committee. Most recently, at the 2020 annual general meeting, Daniela Borgert was elected club Captain after a successful representative State Masters career having first joined Leichhardt Rowing Club in the 1980s as a coxswain at just 14 years old.\nClub Presidents.\nFred Walsh was the club's first President, holding the position from 1886 to 1893. FG Baker was president during World War II and instrumental in a new clubhouse built in 1940. However, by 1942, Neil McCallum as Club Captain provided support in negotiation with both council and military officials following wartime waterfront acquisitions in Leichhardt Park. The “new” clubhouse was then relocated to its current site.\nSince 1946, thirteen members have served as president until 1985. Two of those as life members, Robert (Stan) Jones 1938 and Barry Moynahan 1970, were awarded the O.A.M for services to the club and sport in general. In the period from 1986 to 2001, the position of President was held by Robert W Stone, a former state champion oarsman and national winning coach who was signatory to the 2001 formal agreement with the Uniting Church and Pymble Ladies College. This unique event attracted formal negotiation from both state and national rowing associations. Approval at state government ministerial level was given to the long-term arrangement through a reserve trust. Notwithstanding the club/college partnership, a characteristic of all Presidents over many years has been the ability to actively engage members, parents ad retired rowers in support.\nMembers.\nNotable past members include:\nOlympic representative members include:"

DeLorean, for less than $35 million in 2002. It was previously known as Lamington Farm and the site of a floundering golf course construction project. The 36-hole club was designed by golf course architects Tom Fazio and Tom Fazio II. The first course opened in 2004.\nIn 2005, \"Golf Magazine\" ranked it at #73 in the United States and #84 by \"Golf Digest\" for 2005 and 2006. The club hosted the wedding of Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, in October 2009. As reported in 2012, membership in the golf club cost then at the most $300,000.\nThe golf club hosted the third event in 2022 of the LIV Golf Invitational Series.\nMajors host.\nThe golf club hosted the U.S. Women's Open from July 13 to 16, 2017. The Professional Golfers' Association of America awarded the course the 2022 Men's PGA Championship in 2014.\nOn January 10, 2021, the PGA of America stripped the course of the PGA Championship in 2022. The decision was taken because it was felt that hosting the tournament at the course would be \"detrimental to the PGA of America brand\". The decision was taken several days after Trump was accused of encouraging the storming of the United States Capitol.\nTrump presidency.\nDonald Trump uses a small cottage next to the communal swimming pool as his private residence, with a matching cottage used by Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner. In November 2016, after Trump won the 2016 United States presidential election, the clubhouse was used to host meetings for his presidential transition. Representative Leonard Lance predicted that the resort could become \"Camp David North\". In 2017 it became one of the three official presidential residences, the other two being – at that time – Trump Tower in New York and Mar-a-Lago in Florida. White House staffers receive the same discounts (15–70%) as club members at the Club's pro shop, an arrangement that was flagged as \"absolutely wrong\" by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\nIn May 2017, Trump started to use the property for weekend retreats during the summer when Mar-a-Lago is closed for the season. Trump stated that staying at his property in Bedminster is less expensive and disruptive than going to Trump Tower in New York. This made the property the \"Summer White House\". It is usually used from May to September. In August 2017, the estate was used as a \"working vacation\" of the president for a duration of 17 days while the White House underwent renovations approved by the Obama administration and overseen by the Trump administration.\nIn August 2018, the estate became again the site of the President's \"working vacation\" for close to two weeks.\nTrump went for another \"working vacation\" at his golf club also in August 2019 while the White House underwent some fix ups.\nIn 2020, Trump stayed at the golf club on a number of occasions. On October 1, he held a fundraising event at the mansion. Several hours later, after he was back in Washington, it was announced that his COVID-19 test was positive.\nSecurity issues.\nDue to security concerns, flight restrictions are imposed by the Federal Aviation Administration within a 30-mile radius during Trump's stays at his golf club. Restrictions affect 19 airports in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, among them two airports that have to close down completely because they are within a 10 mile-radius, namely Solberg Airport in Readington, New Jersey and Somerset Airport in Bedminster, New Jersey. Additionally, Academy of Model Aviation Clubs cannot fly model airplanes in this same 30-mile radius.\nWith the official designation as an official residence of Trump, Congress appropriated up to $41 million for its security costs in the time between inauguration and October 1, 2017.\nTax status.\nAs much of the estate is used for agriculture, namely growing hay and raising a small herd of goats, for tax purposes part of the Bedminster course and the Trump course in Colts Neck qualify as farmland. \"The Wall Street Journal\" estimated that the use of the property tax exemption for farmland reduced the tax bill on the two golf courses from $80,000 to less than $1,000. The director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club said that Trump was \"hiding behind a farmland assessment to get a massive tax break on a golf course.\"\nTrump family cemetery.\nIn 2015, Trump received the approval to build a family cemetery at the estate that would include a classical mausoleum. Trump indicated that he wants to be buried at the Bedminster golf course.\nIvana Trump, Trump's ex-wife and mother to Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump, was buried in the Trump family cemetery on July 20, 2022."

        "text": "The 2012–13 Australian Baseball League season was the third Australian Baseball League (ABL) season, and was held from 1 November 2012 to 9 February 2013. The season started with a game between the defending champions Perth Heat and the Adelaide Bite at Norwood Oval in Adelaide.\nThe season consisted of six teams competing in a 46-game schedule followed by a two-round postseason to determine the ABL champion. During the regular season, the Perth Heat participated in the 2012 Asia Series which included the host team and champion team from Korea Baseball Championship in South Korea, the champions from Nippon Professional Baseball in Japan and Chinese Professional Baseball League in Taiwan, and an all-star team from China Baseball League in China. The 2012–13 champions will likewise qualify for the 2013 Asia Series.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the Canberra Cavalry, the Sydney Blue Sox and the Perth Heat progressed to the postseason. Sydney were eliminated by Perth, to face Canberra in the championship series. Canberra defeated Perth two games to nil to win their first ABL championship and be awarded the Claxton Shield. It was the first time a team from the Australian Capital Territory won the Claxton Shield.\nChanges from 2011–12 season.\nRegular season schedule.\nThe previous season included 45 games for each team and facing each team nine times. This was expanded for the 2012–13 season to 46 games, to ensure that each team had the same number of home games as road games (23). This change also meant that each team did not play each other team an equal number of times. In the first three rounds, each team had a bye for one round and played one home and one away series of three games each, played \"... against their two closest geographical neighbours; building upon both traditional and newly established rivalries.\" The remaining ten rounds were made up of four–game series with each team playing two series against the five other teams, one at home and one away.\nPostseason structure.\nIn previous seasons, the postseason had followed the Page playoff system, with the top four teams participating over three weeks. However, in the 2012-13 season only the top three teams qualified for a two-week postseason. The team that finished first—the Canberra Cavalry—earned a direct entry into the ABL championship series and the right to host the series. The second- and third-placed teams—the Sydney Blue Sox and the Perth Heat respectively—are playing in the preliminary final series hosted by the higher finishing team. The winner of that series will qualify for the championship series. Reduced from five games in the semi-final and preliminary final series in 2012, all rounds of the 2013 postseason are being held as best–of–three game series.\nTeams.\nVenues.\nEach of the six teams return from the previous season, and five of them will continue to use the same grounds for their home games. The sole exception is the Melbourne Aces, that played at the Melbourne Ballpark in the south-eastern suburb of Altona. As part of the move from the Aces former home, the Melbourne Showgrounds, A$290,000 worth of improvements were made prior to the start of the season, including A$200,000 investment from the Victorian state government. The ground was the home ground of the Melbourne Monarchs and the Melbourne Bushrangers in the former ABL.\nRosters.\nAs in the previous season, each team has an active roster of 22 players available each round. These players are drawn from 35-man squads. These squads will be confirmed by each of the teams before the beginning of the season.\nRegular season.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAll-Star Game.\nThe 2012 Australian Baseball League All-Star Game, known as the 2012 ConocoPhillips Australia ABL All-Star Game due to naming rights sponsorship from ConocoPhillips, was the second exhibition game held by the Australian Baseball League (ABL) between Team Australia and a team of World All-Stars. The game was held on Sunday, 16 December 2012 at Melbourne Ballpark in Melbourne, Victoria, the new home of the Melbourne Aces. The players involved were selected from the rosters of the six ABL teams, with players not eligible for selection in the Australian team for international tournaments eligible for the World All-Stars.\nPostseason.\nThe 2013 Australian Baseball League (ABL) postseason was held from 2 to 9 February 2013. It was scheduled to start on 1 February, but the first game of the preliminary final series was postponed due to wet weather, and was the first game of a doubleheader the following day. The postseason was contested by three of the six teams participating in the regular season, with the teams with the best winning percentages qualifying.\nThe preliminary final series was hosted by the Sydney Blue Sox at Blue Sox Stadium in Sydney, against the Perth Heat. The Heat won the series two games to nil, to then face the Canberra Cavalry at Narrabundah Ballpark in Canberra in the championship series. Canberra defeated Perth two games to nil to win their first ABL championship and be awarded the Claxton Shield. It was the first time a team from the Australian Capital Territory won the Claxton Shield\nFormat.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the postseason will involve the teams in a two-round structure. Each round will consist of a best-of-three game series between the respective teams. The first-placed team will directly qualify for the championship series, and the second- and third-placed teams will play each other in the preliminary final series, the winner of which will qualify for the second place in the championship series.\nBracket.\nQualification.\nThe Sydney Blue Sox were the first team to clinch a postseason berth, when they defeated the Brisbane Bandits in the first game of their second series at Blue Sox Stadium in Sydney, the final series of the regular season. In the second game of the same series the following night, the Blue Sox clinched a home postseason series by beating the Bandits again. The Canberra Cavalry clinched their first ABL postseason berth that same night, when they defeated the Adelaide Bite at Norwood Oval in Adelaide. The win also guaranteed a regular season finish no lower than second, and like the Blue Sox assured the Cavalry oh hosting a home postseason series.\nThe final makeup of the postseason bracket was not determined until the final day of the regular season. The Cavalry guaranteed themselves first place and a place in the championship series when they beat the Bite in their final game. This win also confirmed the Blue Sox would finish in second place and host the preliminary final series. The Perth Heat qualified for the final postseason position when they defeated the Melbourne Aces at Baseball Park in Perth in their final game. The win eliminated the Bandits from contention.\nPreliminary final.\nThe Sydney Blue Sox hosted the Perth Heat in the preliminary final series at Blue Sox Stadium. The Blue Sox and Heat split their season series 4–4. The four game series played in Sydney in November 2012 was also split 2–2. Over the three ABL seasons played up until this series, Perth has the better record head-to-head against Sydney, with a record of 18–9. The two teams have met in one postseason series before, in the 2011 major semi-final: the Perth Heat won the series 2–0 in Sydney.\nThe first game of the series was scheduled to be played on 1 February, but was postponed due to wet weather. It was rescheduled to be the first game of a doubleheader the following day.\nChampionship series.\nThe Canberra Cavalry will host the Perth Heat in the championship series at Narrabundah Ballpark. The Cavalry won their season series against the Heat 6–2. The four game series played in Canberra in January 2013 was won by Canberra 3–1. Over the three ABL seasons played up until this series, Canberra has the better record head-to-head against Perth, with a record of 13–12. The two teams have not previously met in a postseason series; Canberra qualified for the postseason for the first time in 2013."

However, injuries limited Jenkins to five games in 1970, allowing Joe Taffoni to win the starting right tackle spot that season following Clark's retirement, while at left tackle, 1971 draftee Doug Dieken eventually replaced Schafrath and held the starting spot through 1984. Hickerson remained in the lineup at guard through 1973, by which time Jenkins was long gone from Cleveland. \nJenkins was a backup lineman on Miami's undefeated 1972 Super Bowl championship team. He was one of the players who carried coach Don Shula off the field on their shoulders after the team's victory in Super Bowl VII and as a result his image is included in the bronze statue outside Sun Life Stadium commemorating the event.\nDuring the highlight film of Super Bowl VII produced by NFL Films, Jenkins is shown exclaiming \"damn!\" after the Washington Redskins scored their lone touchdown on Mike Bass' 49-yard return of Garo Yepremian's infamous pass. When the film shows Redskin quarterback Billy Kilmer throwing a pass into the Washington bench on his team's final possession, Jenkins exclaims \"Hey Kilmer! Atta boy Kilmer!\"."

        "text": "The USA Rugby Sevens Collegiate National Championships is an annual competition among the top college rugby teams in the country to decide a national champion in rugby sevens. USA Rugby organized the championship to capitalize on the surge in popularity of rugby sevens following the 2009 announcement of the addition of rugby to the Summer Olympics. USA Rugby recognized that rugby sevens is growing in popularity, participation and interest. At the time of the foundation of the tournament, rugby was one of the fastest growing sports across college campuses. This tournament is a major contributor to the selection process for USA Rugby Olympic athletes.\nHistory.\nUSA Rugby announced in September 2011 the creation of a new sevens tournament. The launch by USA Rugby had a few hiccups. USA Rugby did not officially announce the December 16–17, 2011 tournament and its dates until September 2011, and at that time USA Rugby had still not determined the location. Those mid-December dates were in the middle of exams for some schools. College Station, Texas, was ultimately announced as the venue in November. College Station lacks direct flight to many major cities, and this problem was compounded by the decision to hold the tournament over a Friday and Saturday, requiring students to miss both a Thursday and Friday. For these reasons, many colleges that qualified or were invited to the tournament—such as Penn State, UCLA, Utah, BYU, Boston College, Navy, LSU, Iowa, Dartmouth, Delaware, Cal, and Bowling Green—declined to participate.\nThe inaugural 2011 tournament was contested by 24 teams that qualified based on performance in qualifying tournaments throughout the fall of 2011. The 2011 tournament was won by Life University, defeating Central Washington 22–17 in overtime. Tim Stanfill of Central Washington was the tournament MVP, and Derek Patrick of Miami was the tournament's leading try scorer.\nThe 2012 tournament was more organized, with only one team - UCLA - declining to participate in the tournament. The 2012 tournament also saw increased airtime, with the entire tournament available live via webstream and some of the knockout rounds broadcast on ESPN3.\nFor the 2013 tournament, three teams—Cal, BYU, and UCLA—won bids but declined to participate.\nThe 2015 tournament was held in May — unlike previous tournaments which had been held in December. The tournament took place in Denver over the weekend of May 23–24, less than one week before the 2015 Collegiate Rugby Championship in Philadelphia. Once again, several top teams did not play: BYU, California, Life University, and UCLA.\nQualifying tournaments.\nThe following rugby sevens tournaments, played throughout the fall season preceding the national championships, serve as the qualifying events for the national championships. The winner of each qualifying tournament earns an automatic berth in the national championships. The rest of the places in the national championships are awarded to at large bids chosen by a selection panel.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Comparison of Gaelic football and rugby union",
        "text": "A comparison of Gaelic football and rugby union is possible because of certain similarities between the codes, as well as the numerous dissimilarities.\nUntil the mid-1990s, both codes were strictly amateur. The highest level of Gaelic Football remains amateur, whereas rugby union now offers professional and semi-professional levels of competition. Players have successfully made the transition to top levels in both codes, and because rugby union is played at the professional level, there is a financial lure for players to switch from Gaelic football to rugby union. A small number have made the journey the other way.\nBoth codes are organised on an all-Ireland basis, with provincial bodies.\nRugby union has a number of set pieces, such as line-outs, scrums and rucks that do not have direct equivalents in Gaelic football. Gaelic football aims at a more open kind of play, and as such falls between rugby and soccer.\nPitch.\nBoth codes use rectangular grassed fields however the Gaelic football pitch has a larger area. A Gaelic football pitch is 130–145 metres long and 80–90 metres wide and are marked at distances of 13 m, 20 m and 45 m from each end-line whereas the Rugby field is as near as possible to a maximum of 144m long by 70m wide. with a maximum of 100m between the two try lines.\nAnother key difference is the goal posts. Rugby union posts consists of two posts with a crossbar but without a net, whereas Gaelic football consists of two posts with crossbar and a net. The area above the crossbar is used for scoring in both codes, however, only in Gaelic football is the area underneath the posts used for scoring kicks. The goal posts in Gaelic football are narrower and the crossbar is lower.\nBall.\nThe obvious difference is the ball used.\nRugby union uses an oval ball (a prolate spheroid), somewhat similar to an American or Australian rules football. This makes a difference in the variety and style of kicking. Rugby union is capable of producing a diverse range of kicking styles.\nGaelic football uses a round ball similar to a football (i.e., soccer ball) or volleyball. The round ball can be kicked anyway you like, inside, outside and middle of your boot. The instep is the most popular style based on culture, the drop punt used in Gaelic is a far superior kick in terms of distance and accuracy but is rarely taught. It is made of 18 stitched leather panels, with a circumference of , weighing between when dry. It may be kicked or \"hand passed\". A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.\nDuration.\nThe majority of adult Gaelic football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two-halves of 30 minutes, with the exception of senior inter-county games which last for 70 minutes (two-halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two-halves of 10 minutes). The under-12s have a half of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time lasts for about 15 minutes.\nA rugby union game is divided into two-halves of 40 minutes (or shorter for lower-grade games) separated by a half time period of up to 15 minutes in an international match. Most notably, a rugby union game will continue after the scheduled end of a half (half-time or full-time) until the ball becomes dead – any occurrence that would have play restart with a scrum or line-out, or when a team scores. This has led to some 'nail-biting' finishes where teams losing by only a small margin work their way towards scoring, and games can go on several minutes over time. The clock is also stopped during substitutions and for injuries, so the referee does not need to add stoppage time.\nAdvancing the ball.\nIn both games, players must dispose of the ball correctly, by hand or by foot. Gaelic football deems the \"open hand tap\" to be legitimate disposal.\nUnlike Gaelic football, rugby union has an offside rule. In rugby union, it is illegal to throw (pass) the ball in a forward direction: a player in a position to receive such a pass would in most cases be offside anyway.\nTackles and blocks.\nRugby union allows full tackling above the knees and below the shoulders, whereas Gaelic football explicitly disallows tackling. Rugby union rules do not allow tackles above the plane of the shoulders. Only the player who has possession of the ball can be tackled. The attacker must also attempt to wrap his or her arms around the player being tackled: merely pushing the player being tackled to ground with a shoulder is illegal. If a maul or ruck is formed, a player may not \"ram\" into the formation without first binding to the players.\nThe level of tackling allowed in Gaelic football is more robust than in association football, but less than rugby union. Shoulder to shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:\nGaelic football allows \"shepherding\" or blocking, limited to use on players in possession of the ball. Blocking is illegal in rugby union.\nPenalties.\nIn Gaelic football the penalties available (in increasing order of severity) are:\nScoring.\nRugby union is played between two teams – the one that scores more points wins the game. Points can be scored in several ways: a try, scored by grounding the ball in the in-goal area (between the goal line and the dead ball line), is worth 5 points and a subsequent conversion kick scores 2 points; a successful penalty kick or a drop goal each score 3 points. The values of each of these scoring methods have been changed over the years.\nIn Gaelic football, if the ball goes over the crossbar, a \"point\" is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point can be scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or by fisting it over in which case the hand must be closed whilst striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a \"goal\", worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal can only be scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into the net. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0–21 Team B 4–8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).\nPlayers.\nThere is no \"goalkeeper\" in rugby union, instead there is a \"fullback\", although it must be said that the fullback in rugby union is not required to guard a goal in the same way that a goalkeeper does. A rugby union fullback generally fields the long range kicks, and makes long range attacks.\nBoth codes have a maximum of 15 players per side on the field at any one time.\nOrigins.\nBoth sports have their origins in the traditional football games of Europe, with a great deal of formal 19th century codification overlaying them.\nGaelic Football was codified by the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) in 1887. Gaelic football is thought to have originated with the ancient Irish game of \"caid\". The codification of Gaelic football was partly in response to the growing popularity of Association football and rugby in Ireland.\nThe code of football later known as rugby union can be traced to three events which occurred in England: the first set of written rules in 1845, the Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863 and the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The code was originally known simply as \"rugby football.\" It was not until a schism in 1895, over the payment of players, which resulted in the formation of the separate code of rugby league, that the name \"rugby union\" was used to differentiate the original rugby code.\nMichael Cusack one of the founders of the Gaelic Athletic Association had been known as a rugby player in Ireland, and was involved with the game at Blackrock College and Clongowes Wood College. Cusack was a native Irish speaker and had been concerned with the decline of indigenous Irish football codes. Cusack, along with others codified Gaelic football in 1887.\nInteraction between the two codes.\nRugby union grounds are used for many other sports, including rugby league, American football and Gaelic football. Rugby union is also notable for promoting the British and Irish Lions, a selection of players from Britain and Ireland rugby team.\nRule 42 (Rule 5.1 in the 2009 rulebook) prohibits the use of GAA property for games with interests in conflict with the interests of the GAA referred to by some as \"garrison games\" or foreign sports. Current rules state that GAA property may only be used for the purpose or in connection with the playing of games controlled by the association. Sports not considered 'in conflict' with the GAA have been permitted.\nOn 16 April 2005 the GAA's congress voted to temporarily relax Rule 42 and allow international Association Football and Rugby to be played in the stadium while Lansdowne Road Football Ground was closed for redevelopment. The first soccer and rugby union games permitted in Croke Park took place in early 2007, the first such fixture being Ireland's home match in the Six Nations Rugby Union Championship against France.\nIn January 2006, it was announced that the GAA had reached agreement with the FAI and IRFU to stage two Six Nations games and four football internationals at Croke Park in 2007 and in February 2007, use of the pitch by the FAI and the IRFU in 2008 was also agreed. These agreements were within the temporary relaxation terms, as Lansdowne Road was still under redevelopment until 2010. Although the GAA had said that hosted use of Croke Park would not extend beyond 2008, irrespective of the redevelopment progress, fixtures for the 2009 Six Nations rugby tournament saw the Irish rugby team using Croke Park for a third season.\n11 February 2007 saw the first Rugby Union international to be played there. Ireland were leading France in a Six Nations clash, but lost 20–17 after conceding a last-minute converted try.\nA second match between Ireland and England on 24 February 2007 was politically symbolic because of the events of Bloody Sunday in 1920. There was considerable concern as to what reaction there would be to the singing of \"God Save the Queen\", which was being used as the anthem of the England team. Ultimately the song was sung without interruption or incident, and applauded by both sets of supporters at the match, which Ireland won by 43–13 (their largest ever win over England in rugby).\nRule 27, sometimes referred to as \"The Ban\", banned GAA members from taking part in or watching non-Gaelic games. Punishment for violating this rule was expulsion from the organisation and it remained in place from 1901 until 1971. During that time people such as Douglas Hyde, GAA patron and then President of Ireland, were expelled for attending a soccer international. To circumvent the ban members such as Moss Keane would commonly adopt a false name. The last person to be suspended from the GAA for violating Rule 27 was Liam Madden, an architect and member of Longford GAA in 1969\nInternational competition.\nRugby union has been an international game since 1871, when beat at Raeburn Place in Edinburgh. entered international competition in 1875, and have played matches continuously ever since. The Rugby World Cup itself is of much more recent origin, dating back to 1987, when invitations were sent out to various national sides. Entry has been through qualifying rounds ever since.\nGaelic football is mostly domestic, although it remains popular in areas with major Irish emigre populations. Although the game is formally organised outside Ireland, there are no true national Gaelic football teams.\nHowever, Gaelic footballers do participate in one form of international competition – international rules football. This is a compromise code between Gaelic football and Australian rules football, so is strictly speaking not Gaelic football, although an Irish national side is picked for it. The earliest game of the International Rules Series was in 1984. These were prefigured by an Australian tour of Ireland in 1967 organised by Harry Beitzel, which played against domestic sides."

        "text": "The individual show jumping at the 1928 Summer Olympics took place on 12 August 1928 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam. Scores from the individual competition were summed to give results in the team competition. There were 46 competitors from 16 nations. Each nation could send a team of three riders; 15 nations did so, while Japan had a single rider. The event was won by František Ventura of Czechoslovakia, the nation's first medal in individual jumping. France earned its first medal in the event since 1912 with Pierre Bertran de Balanda's silver. Charles-Gustave Kuhn took bronze, putting Switzerland on the podium for the second consecutive Games.\nBackground.\nThis was the fifth appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nThree of the top 10 riders from the 1924 competition returned: gold medalist Alphonse Gemuseus of Switzerland, silver medalist (and 1920 gold medalist) Tommaso Lequio di Assaba of Italy, and ninth-place finisher José Álvarez de Bohórquez of Spain.\nArgentina, Hungary, Japan, and the Netherlands each made their debut in the event. Belgium and France both competed for the fifth time, the only nations to have competed at each appearance of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\n\"The obstacles with number 16 as a maximum, the minimum height being 1 m. 25, and the maximum height 1 m. 40 (4’ to 4’ 9”). The canter must be free and at a speed of 400 m. (43 yds.) a minute. The timekeeper shall not take into account greater speed, but on the other hand a lower speed shall be penalised by 0.25 of a point per second over the time allowed. Grazing, displacing or touching the obstacles shall not be taken into account.\" The course was 720 metres long.\nTies for medal position were broken with re-rides, while all other ties were broken by time.\nSchedule.\nThe first round was interrupted by rain and had to be continued on the second day.\nResults.\nThe course was relatively easy, with seven riders able to finish with no faults. Three of them repeated the feat in the first re-ride, guaranteeing those riders the medals and requiring a second re-ride to determine who would receive which medal. In the second re-ride, some obstacles were raised to 1.60 metres in height to increase the difficulty.\nSource: Official results; De Wael"

The test was the same as for the 1924 Olympics, but the 10-minute limit was now raised to 13 minutes, giving the riders much needed time to complete it without losing points for going over the time allowed. Judging created controversy, both due to nationalistic tendencies by judges and the fact that individual judges had differing opinions on what was correct. While there was discussion on how to make it more fair—including dropping the lowest and highest scores, only having one judge from a neutral county, and removing 20 points from each score given to a countryman of each judge—no changes were made until after the judging scandal at the 1956 Games.\nScores from the individual competition were summed to give results in the team competition.\nResults.\nSource: Official results; De Wael"

        "title": "SummerSlam (2013)",
        "text": "The 2013 SummerSlam was the 26th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It took place on August 18, 2013, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the fifth consecutive year. The event's card consisted of nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show.\nIn the main event, Daniel Bryan defeated John Cena to become the new WWE Champion, with Triple H acting as special guest referee, only to be attacked by Triple H and lose it minutes later to Randy Orton, who cashed in the Money in the Bank contract. In other prominent matches, Alberto Del Rio defeated Christian to retain the World Heavyweight Championship and Brock Lesnar defeated CM Punk in a No Disqualification match.\nThe event received 296,900 buys, down from previous year's event of 358,000.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since been considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania.&gt; The 2013 event was the 26th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 18, 2013, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the fifth consecutive year.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised nine matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television programs, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nOn the July 15 episode of \"Raw\", new Raw General Manager Brad Maddox announced that WWE Champion John Cena could choose his own Summerslam opponent. Later that night, after taking an informal poll of the live audience, he chose Daniel Bryan. In the weeks before SummerSlam, Vince McMahon would berate Daniel Bryan by trying to make him shave his beard, putting him into a gauntlet match against his former friend Kane. On the August 12 episode of \"Raw\", Maddox served as special guest referee in a match with Bryan facing Wade Barrett. After making a quick count to let Barrett win the match, Maddox offered his services as the guest referee for the Cena vs. Bryan match at the PPV when Triple H interceded, and announced he'd serve as referee instead (punctuated by a Pedigree to Maddox).\nAfter AJ Lee retained her Divas Championship against Kaitlyn at Money in the Bank and later cost Dolph Ziggler his attempt at winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Ziggler broke up with AJ the next night on \"Raw\", causing her to distract Ziggler in his non-title rematch against Del Rio and leaving Big E Langston to attack him. On the July 29 episode of \"Raw\", Kaitlyn defeated AJ in a non-title match to stay in contention for the Divas Championship, but four days later on \"SmackDown\", AJ defeated Kaitlyn to retain the championship after Layla interfered and protected AJ. A week later on \"SmackDown\", The Miz (the host of SummerSlam) announced that Kaitlyn and Ziggler would face AJ and Langston in a mixed tag team match at the PPV.\nAt Payback, CM Punk defeated Chris Jericho in his return in his hometown. The next night on \"Raw\", he challenged World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio to a match, turning face. He won by countout, but a returning Brock Lesnar attacked him. Over the next few weeks, tension rose between Punk and Paul Heyman, who cost Punk the WWE Championship Money in the Bank Ladder Match at Money in the Bank. The next night on \"Raw\", Lesnar again attacked Punk. The next week, Punk challenged Lesnar to a match at Summerslam. Heyman accepted on Lesnar's behalf. During the SummerSlam kickoff show, Heyman announced that both Lesnar and Punk had agreed to make the match no disqualification.\nOn the July 19 episode of \"SmackDown\", Randy Orton defeated World Heavyweight Champion Alberto Del Rio in a non-title match. However, on the July 29 \"Raw\", Christian also defeated Del Rio in a non-title match. To determine the next challenger for Del Rio's championship, new SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero decided to make a triple threat match between Christian, Orton, and the returning Rob Van Dam. The match ended with Christian reversing Orton's attempt of an RKO into a backslide pin, winning the match and becoming the new #1 contender for the title before being attacked by Del Rio. On the August 9 episode of \"SmackDown\", Christian defeated Del Rio in another non-title match.\nAt the Money in the Bank pay-per-view on July 14, Damien Sandow won the Money in the Bank briefcase for a future World Heavyweight Championship shot, betraying his former tag team partner Cody Rhodes in the process. Rhodes attacked Sandow after the latter's loss to Christian the following night on \"Raw\". On the July 26 episode of \"SmackDown\", while Sandow was facing Randy Orton in a singles match, Rhodes took his briefcase, causing Sandow to lose the match and search for it. Rhodes threw it into the Gulf of Mexico, and Sandow was unable to retrieve it because he couldn't swim. It was announced on the August 5 \"Raw\" that Rhodes would face Sandow at SummerSlam. Four days later on \"SmackDown\", Sandow debuted his new, brown Money in the Bank briefcase with a new World Heavyweight Championship contract. Later on, after Christian defeated Del Rio in a non-title match, Sandow attempted to cash in his contract, but his effort was thwarted by Rhodes.\nOn the July 8 episode of \"Raw\", after Kane defeated Christian, The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, and Erick Rowan) attacked Kane, removing him from competing at the Money in the Bank ladder match for the WWE Championship contract. The Wyatt Family attacked Kane again three weeks later on \"Raw\", after losing to Daniel Bryan. A week later on \"Raw\", after Harper and Rowan defeated Tons of Funk (Brodus Clay and Tensai), Kane announced that he would face Bray Wyatt in a Ring of Fire match at SummerSlam.\nOn the August 12 episode of \"Raw\", as a result of their feud stemming from starring on \"Total Divas\", Natalya challenged Brie Bella to a match at the pay-per-view, which she accepted by slapping Natalya's face. Natalya also announced that The Funkadactyls (Naomi and Cameron) will be in her corner because Eva Marie has aligned herself with The Bella Twins (Brie and Nikki Bella).\nAlso on the August 12 episode of \"Raw\", Rob Van Dam won a 20-man battle royal (lastly eliminating Mark Henry) to challenge Dean Ambrose for the United States Championship at the SummerSlam Kickoff Show, one hour before the pay-per-view broadcast.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show, Dean Ambrose defended the United States Championship against Rob Van Dam. The match was streamed live on WWE.com, the WWE app, and various social sites. In the end, Van Dam executed a Five Star Frog Splash on Ambrose, but Roman Reigns interfered and attacked Van Dam with a Spear, meaning Van Dam won by disqualification.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe show opened with The Miz welcoming to SummerSlam, with JoJo singing the national anthem after the opening pyro.\nThe first match pitted Kane against Bray Wyatt in a Ring of Fire match. Following three chokeslams, Kane gestured for a Tombstone Piledriver, but Luke Harper and Erick Rowan overcame the flames using an asbestos blanket and were able to attack Kane, who was attempting to fight them off. Wyatt executed Sister Abigail on Kane for the win. Following the match, Wyatt retreated to his rocking chair and watched Harper and Rowan use two sets of steel steps to smash Kane's skull.\nThe next match was between Cody Rhodes and Damien Sandow. In the end, Rhodes performed the Cross Rhodes to win the match.\nIn the third match, Alberto Del Rio faced Christian for the World Heavyweight Championship. Del Rio immediately began targeting Christian's shoulder. The match ended when Christian performed a Spear on Del Rio but his injured shoulder prevented him from covering Del Rio. Del Rio forced Christian to submit to the Cross Armbreaker to retain the title. After the match, Del Rio declared himself (in both English and Spanish) a true role model for the WWE Universe.\nIn the fourth match, Natalya faced Brie Bella. When Eva Marie and Nikki Bella tried to intervene, Cameron and Naomi stepped in on Natalya's behalf, attacking Eva and Nikki. After an Alabama Slam, Natalya forced Brie to submit to the Sharpshooter to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nIn the fifth match, Brock Lesnar faced CM Punk in a no-disqualification match. After some 25 minutes of back and forth fighting involving chair shots, submission holds, aerial maneuvers and outside brawling, Punk executed the Go to Sleep on Lesnar but Paul Heyman broke up the pinfall. Moments later, Punk applied the Anaconda Vice on Lesnar but Heyman interfered. Punk punched Heyman and applied the Anaconda Vise on Heyman but Lesnar broke the hold by hitting Punk with a chair. Lesnar executed an F-5 onto a chair for the victory. Following the match, the crowd loudly chanted Punk's name as he limped back up the ramp.\nIn the next match, Dolph Ziggler and Kaitlyn fought Big E Langston and Divas Champion AJ Lee. In the end, Kaitlyn executed a Spear on AJ outside the ring. Big E executed a Clothesline on Ziggler for a near-fall. Ziggler executed a Zig-Zag on Big E for the victory.\nIn the main event, John Cena defended the WWE Championship against Daniel Bryan with Triple H as the Special Guest Referee. The match was extremely back and forth between the 2. After Bryan hit the Yes kicks, Cena got back the upper hand and went for the Five Knuckle Shuffle, but Bryan countered and kicked him. Cena then got Bryan down again and this time hit the Five Knuckle Shuffle. Cena then went for an Attitude Adjustment but Bryan countered. Bryan hit a missile dropkick for a nearfall. Later on Bryan locked Cena into an STF but Cena got out, only to get suplexed numerous times before being put in the Yes! lock. Cena got out of it though and hit the Attitude Adjustment for a 2 count. Bryan hit a flying Headbutt on Cena for a near fall, and when he dived to the outside of the ring Cena countered and regained control. Cena locked Bryan into the STF, but Bryan countered it into the Yes! lock, but Cena reached the ropes. The two continued to go back and forth with a series of moves that culminated after Bryan hit Cena with a kick to the head, followed by a Running Knee on Cena to win his first WWE Championship. As Bryan celebrated, Cena shook Bryan's hand and offered him advice. Cena shook Triple H's hand before departing. The match would later be named Match of the Year by Pro Wrestling Illustrated.\nRandy Orton then appeared with his Money in the Bank contract, raising the briefcase. Triple H attacked Bryan with a Pedigree, turning heel for the first time since 2006. Orton cashed in the contract and pinned Bryan to win the title.\nAftermath.\nThis was the last SummerSlam to feature the World Heavyweight Championship, as the title was unified with the WWE Championship at December's event, with the latter being renamed to WWE World Heavyweight Championship.\nOn the August 19 episode on \"Raw\", John Cena addressed the audience, informing them he was temporally leaving WWE due to a triceps surgery. He returned at the Hell in a Cell pay-per-view against Alberto Del Rio for the World Heavyweight Championship. The same day, The Shield (Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose) and Randy Orton formed an alliance with the WWE COO Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, The Authority, which was created to stop Daniel Bryan from regaining the WWE Championship. The storyline between Bryan and The Authority culminated at WrestleMania XXX, where Bryan defeated Triple H to be added in the WWE World Heavyweight Championship main event, thus making it a triple threat match, which Bryan won. The Authority angle would continue, feuding with anyone they felt like, until WrestleMania 32, where it finally disbanded for good.\nDel Rio's former ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez began working with Rob Van Dam. On the September 13 episode of \"SmackDown\", he was defeated by Del Rio and was assaulted by him afterwards. Van Dam challenged Del Rio twice for the World Heavyweight Championship at Night of Champions and Battleground, both in losing efforts.\nAfter SummerSlam, AJ Lee ended her partnership with Big E and at Night of Champions, she faced Natalya, Naomi and Brie Bella for the Divas Championship in a fatal four-way match. During at that time, Lee started a feud with the cast of E!'s TV series \"Total Divas\" by cutting a worked shoot promo criticizing them.\nCM Punk continued to feud with Paul Heyman after his loss to Brock Lesnar at SummerSlam by defeating the Intercontinental Champion, at that time, Curtis Axel on the August 26 episode of \"Raw\".\nOn the September 2 episode of \"Raw\", Big Show fought Daniel Bryan and attempted to exit the ring before Stephanie McMahon told him to return and knock out Bryan. That same night, Cody Rhodes was fired after losing to Randy Orton. Then, on the September 9 episode, Rhodes' brother Goldust returned in an attempt to earn his brother's job back, but failed to do so. The Authority then invited Cody Rhodes' and Goldust's father Dusty Rhodes on \"Raw\", but after an argument Stephanie McMahon ordered Big Show to knockout the American Dream. At Battleground, Cody Rhodes and Goldust got their jobs back after defeating The Shield's Seth Rollins and Roman Reigns and on the October 14 episode of \"Raw\", they defeated Rollins and Reigns to win the WWE Tag Team Championship in a No Disqualification match due to interference by Big Show, who knocked out all three members of The Shield."

        "text": "The 2015 FIFA Club World Cup (officially known as the FIFA Club World Cup Japan 2015 presented by Alibaba E-Auto for sponsorship reasons) was the 12th edition of the FIFA Club World Cup, a FIFA-organised international club football tournament between the winners of the six continental confederations, as well as the host nation's league champions. The tournament was hosted by Japan between 10 and 20 December 2015.\nDefending champions Real Madrid did not qualify as they were eliminated in the semi-finals of the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League. The eventual winners of that competition, Barcelona, went on to win a record third Club World Cup title, beating Guangzhou Evergrande 3–0 in the semi-finals before beating River Plate by the same margin in the final.\nHost bids.\nThe application process for the 2015–2016 as well as the 2017–2018 editions, i.e. two hosts, each hosting two years, began in February 2014. Member associations interested in hosting had to submit a declaration of interest by 30 March 2014, and provide the complete set of bidding documents by 25 August 2014. The FIFA Executive Committee was to select the hosts at their meeting in Morocco in December 2014. However, no such decision regarding the 2015–2016 host was made until 2015.\nThe following countries expressed an interest in bidding to host the tournament:\nJapan was officially confirmed as the host of the 2015 and 2016 tournaments on 23 April 2015.\nProposed change to format.\nUnder a proposed change to the competition, led by the Oceania Football Confederation, the new format would mean a removal of the knockout rounds for the quarter-finals and play-off round, replacing it with two round-robin groups of three teams, consisting of two teams from the host nation and the champions of AFC, CAF, CONCACAF, and OFC, with the group winners advancing to the semi-finals to play the champions of CONMEBOL and UEFA. This would allow for all teams to play at least two matches, avoiding the current situation where the loser of the play-off round would play only one match.

        "title": "Marty Wilson (basketball)",
        "text": "Lamar \"Marty\" Wilson (born October 17, 1966) is an American college basketball coach, currently an assistant coach at UC Berkeley. Wilson previously served as head coach at his alma mater Pepperdine University.\nPlaying career.\nAs a player at Pepperdine, Wilson ended his career in fifth place on the all-time assists list with 342 (he still ranks ninth). Under head coach Jim Harrick, Wilson was a backup point guard in\n1984-85 and 1985–86, and the Waves advanced to the NCAA Tournament both seasons. A back injury sidelined Wilson for the entire 1986-87 campaign, but he took over as the starting point\nguard in 1987-88. Unfortunately, he suffered a season-ending knee injury in the 17th game of the season, though the Waves still advanced to the NIT.\nTom Asbury took over as head coach in 1988-89, and Wilson's extensive rehabilitation paid off as he returned to the starting lineup as a senior and led the Waves to a 20–13 record and the\nsecond round of the NIT. The Waves posted a record of 97–58 (.626) during his five seasons as a student-athlete.\nWilson graduated from Pepperdine in 1989 with a bachelor's degree in communications. In the year between his graduation and his return to Pepperdine as an assistant coach, Wilson tried out for the Continental Basketball Association and was an assistant coach at Simi Valley High School.\nCoaching resume.\nMarty Wilson is set on helping the program return to the triumphant days that\nhe previously enjoyed as a player and assistant coach with the program.\nAfter 21 seasons as an assistant coach, including nine at Pepperdine, Marty Wilson was elevated to the position of head coach of the Waves following the 2010-11 season. Wilson has\ncompiled an impressive record in Malibu, beginning as a student athlete (1985–89) and continuing as an assistant coach (1991–96, which included a brief stint as the interim head coach) and as the\nassociate head coach for three seasons (2009–11).\nThe Waves went 10-19 in his first season. Including his time as interim coach, his overall record is 13-29 in two seasons at Pepperdine.\nExcluding interim coaches, Wilson is the 12th men's basketball head coach in Pepperdine history.\nDuring his first six seasons on the Waves’ staff, which followed his graduation in 1989, Wilson helped Pepperdine to a 106-72 (.596) record. He began as the restricted-earnings coach before being\nelevated to full-time status for the 1994-95 season.\nWith Wilson on the bench, Pepperdine earned bids to the NCAA Tournament in 1991, 1992 and 1994 and made the NIT in 1993. The Waves also won West Coast Conference regular-season titles in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and WCC Tournament titles in 1991, 1992 and 1994.\nFollowing Tom Asbury's departure for Kansas State after the 1993-94 season, Wilson remained on the staff under new head coach Tony Fuller. When Fuller resigned midway through the 1995-96 season, Wilson took over on an interim basis at the age of 28 and directed the Waves to a 3–10 record down the stretch. Most notably, that included an upset of a Steve Nash-led Santa Clara team in the first round of the WCC Tournament.\nWilson left Malibu but stayed in Southern California for the next several years, spending two seasons (1996–97 and 1997–98) as an assistant coach at San Diego, where he was also the recruiting coordinator under head coach Brad Holland.\nHe spent the next six seasons (1999-2004) at UC Santa Barbara, and was the top assistant for Bob Williams as the Gauchos averaged 18 wins a season during his last three years there. UCSB won the Big West Conference's West Division in 1999, captured the Big West Tournament title and advanced to the NCAA Tournament in 2002 and won the Big West regular-season title and made an appearance in the NIT in 2003.\nPrior to his return to Pepperdine, Wilson was an assistant for four seasons (2005–08) at Utah under head coaches Ray Giacoletti and Jim Boylen. During his first season with Boylen, the Utes went 29-6, won the Mountain West Conference's regular-season title, advanced to the NCAA Tournament's Sweet Sixteen and finished the year ranked 18th nationally by the Associated Press.\nIn February 2008, Wilson returned to Pepperdine as the associate head coach and head coach in waiting following the retirement of Asbury.\nAfter 7 seasons, Pepperdine announced that Wilson would not return as head coach effective at the end of the 2017-18 season.\nOn April 5, 2018, Wilson was hired by Cal as an assistant coach under Wyking Jones.\nPersonal life.\nBorn Lamar Wilson in Pacoima, California, Wilson is married and has two grown children."

He was capped for Wales 21 times between 1964 and 1969 and was part of three Five Nations winning teams.\nRugby career.\nThomas played rugby as a school boy, and was selected to represent his country for the Welsh Secondary Schools side. On leaving Neath Grammar School, he matriculated at Cambridge University, studying the natural sciences tripos as an undergraduate at Christ's College, Cambridge. He was selected for the University team, and won three sporting 'Blues' playing in the Varsity Match in 1960, 1961 and 1962. During his time back in Wales, away from College, he represented his local team Neath, and faced the touring South African team of 1961 as part of a joint Aberavon / Neath side. On leaving Cambridge he returned to Neath where he became an integral member of the Neath team. At the age of 22, he was selected for his first full international cap when he was chosen to represent Wales against England as part of the 1963 Five Nations Championship.\nThomas went on to represent Wales 21 times between 1963 and 1969, each of his caps won as a Neath player, his only senior club. He toured twice with Wales, in 1964 to South Africa, playing in all four games, and in 1969 to Australasia and Fiji.

In his 1989 book \"The Rugby Clubs of Wales\", David Parry-Jones describes' Thomas as bringing a \"fresh dimension to the tradition of tough, closely concentrated forward play\" who was able to \"attract and mould distant talent which might otherwise have found its way into other clubs\".\nThomas was father-in-law to Wales international Rowland Phillips and Neath flanker Robin Jones. He was the grandfather of Swansea second-row Jack Jones."

        "text": "The Australian Women's Ice Hockey League (AWIHL) is Australia's top-tier women's ice hockey league. Established in 2005 as Australia's first women's national league, the AWIHL has amateur status and is sanctioned by Ice Hockey Australia (a member of the International Ice Hockey Federation). The AWIHL is currently contested by five teams from five Australian states, including South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales, Western Australia and Victoria. The league champion is awarded the Joan McKowen Memorial Trophy and the premier is awarded the Stephanie Boxall Trophy. The most successful team in AWIHL history is Melbourne Ice, who have claimed seven championship titles. The current champion, from 2019–20, is the Sydney Sirens, who claimed their second title.\nHistory.\nBeginning.\nShowcase Series.\nIn 2005, the probability of establishing a national women's ice hockey league was discussed by the National Women's Council. Due to large costs to players to participate in such a league, an alternative proposal for a much shorter Showcase Series was passed around for consideration to begin in the 2006 season. The Series would see four teams competing in mini-tournaments during February to June. Each round robin style tournament would occur over a weekend and throughout the Showcase Series period between February and June, each team would travel twice and host the tournament once. The first Showcase series was planned in February 2006 for Newcastle, New South Wales. The second series would be in March 2006 in Bendigo, Victoria, the third would occur in April 2006 in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory. In May, the series would be held in Adelaide, South Australia, and in June the fifth series would take place in Brisbane, Queensland. At this time, a full season would follow in November 2006 and stretch over into summer 2007.\nThe first Showcase Series proved to be successful where, in each mini-series, three teams would play each other twice in a round robin style tournament. Five clubs ended up being involved in the Showcase Series which consisted of five mini-tournaments held on a weekend each month in a different city.\nThe Showcase Series returned for a second season in October 2006, and ran until February 2007. A national women's league did not start in November 2006, as previously hoped. In this second season four mini-series were held, one weekend mini tournament was played each month between only four teams representing Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Brisbane, Queensland, Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney. The purpose of the Showcase Series continued to be as a precursor to a national women's league that was being actively planned.\nForming the AWIHL.\nThe official formation of the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League (AWIHL) was in 2007, following the two seasons of \"Showcase Series\" that were held in 2006 and 2007.\nThe Australian Women's Ice Hockey League is recognised by Ice Hockey Australia (IHA) as the premier senior women's national ice hockey competition.\nThe league conducted its inaugural season with four teams: Adelaide Assassins, Brisbane Goannas, Melbourne Dragons, and Sydney Sirens. The team that won the finals series at the end of each season became the AWIHL champions and were presented a perpetual trophy that was donated by Westlakes Trophies and Framing and was called the West Lakes Trophy.\n2010s.\nIn October 2010, the Australian Women's Ice Hockey League conducted a competition to replace the original league logo with a new one. The competition closed 1 December 2010, and the original logo was replaced by the current one.\nIn the early 2010s there was a move to align AWIHL teams with Australian Ice Hockey League (AIHL) counterparts. This strategy led to three of the four AWIHL teams to either sign a memorandum of understanding or merge with AIHL teams to create dual program organisations. The Melbourne Dragons became the Melbourne Ice by signing a MOU, that allowed the Dragons management to remain in control of the team. Adelaide Assassins became the Adelaide Adrenaline and Sydney Sirens became the North Star Sirens. Both Adelaide and Sydney would later return to being independently run organisations, but the Ice remain in the league since 2010.\nIn 2016, IHA announced the formation of the annual Australian Women's Tier 2 Show Case Series (AW2SCS) to act as a feeder league to the AWIHL and provide a development pathway from state leagues to the AWIHL. Initially the league had four teams based in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne (x2). By 2019 the AW2SCS had five teams and had expanded to Adelaide and Perth.\nThe AWIHL officially expanded in August 2018 for the first time, with the introduction of the Perth Inferno to the league. Perth had played two exhibition games against the Sydney Sirens the season before and had competed in and won the Australian Women's Tier 2 Show Case Series two years in a row on their road to AWIHL entry.\nTwo AWIHL teams featured in Australasia's Best Sporting Team list 2019. The list, conducted by Platinum Asset Management and GAIN LINE Analytics, ranked and named the top 25 sporting teams in Australasia. In 2019, AWIHL teams, Sydney Sirens and Melbourne Ice were ranked inside the top 25 sporting teams. The Sirens were ranked twenty-first and Melbourne Ice were ranked twenty-third.\nCOVID-19 period.\nThe AWIHL, like many other Australian sporting leagues, was forced to cancel two consecutive league seasons due to multiple COVID-19 outbreaks and border and health response restrictions between 2020 and 2022. In August 2022, AWIHL Commissioner, Melissa Rulli, officially stepped down from her position after nearly five years in the role. Rulli held the position of Commissioner from December 2017 to August 2022 and oversaw steady viewership and accessibility growth of the AWIHL in that time until the COVID-19 hiatus. Ice Hockey Australia opened an expression of interest process on 26 August 2022 to find Rulli's replacement, with applications closing on 16 September 2022. This provides IHA enough time to appoint a new Commissioner ahead of the 2022–23 season start in November 2022.\n2020s.\nAfter a two-year hiatus, the AWIHL announced it would return to action for the 2022–23 season, scheduled to kick off in November 2022 and run through til March 2023.\nTeams.\nAs of 2022, the AWIHL has five active teams, including four founding members and one expansion team. The five teams are from five different Australian states and capital cities, including, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia.\n \n \n \nFuture expansion.\nFuture expansion has been mooted, including into New Zealand, which, since 2014, runs a four team national league of its own, NZWIHL, but there are no active bids to join the league. Melbourne Chargers Ice Hockey Club, who compete in the Women's Tier 2 Show Case Series, have publicly said their goal is to move up divisions to the AWIHL. The club is working towards that goal and have signed a partnership with AIHL team Melbourne Mustangs, to help them on their way to achieving this goal. In the 2019–20 Annual Report, IHA, stated its intentions to seek an increase in the number of teams participating in AWIHL to six teams.\nTeam history.\nAdelaide Rush.\nAdelaide was one of the four founding teams of the AWIHL in 2007 and also competed in the showcase series in 2006. Originally established as the Adelaide Assassins, the South Australian outfit began life as the dominant force in women's hockey in Australia, winning the first five straight AWIHL championship titles. In 2011–12, the team merged and became part of the Adelaide Adrenaline organisation. Between 2011–12 and 2015–16 the Adrenaline ran both the women's and men's programs in the AWIHL and AIHL. Ahead of the 2016–17 season, the AWIHL team parted ways with the Adrenaline and the new organisation was established to run the AWIHL licence in Adelaide, the Adelaide Rush.\nBrisbane Lightning.\nBrisbane was the first team to join the AWIHL in 2006. They participated in the showcase series in 2006 and was one of the four founding teams in the AWIHL in 2007. Setup as a not-for-profit incorporated sporting organisation, the Brisbane, Queensland-based club was known as the Brisbane Goannas from establishment until 2022. The team has run a successful junior to senior development program known as the Gecko's to Goannas Program. On 3 October 2022, the Goannas announced they had partnered with the Brisbane Lightning organisation, who had their men's program accepted into the AIHL for 2023, and officially changed their name to match, becoming the Brisbane Lightning.\nMelbourne Ice.\nMelbourne was one of the four founding teams of the AWIHL in 2007. Established in 2005 as Melbourne Dragons, in 2010, the team entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Melbourne Ice organisation that runs a men's program in the Australian Ice Hockey League. The agreement saw the Dragons change their name and branding to match the Melbourne Ice and a sharing of off-ice resources and guidance. However, the Dragons organisation retained a lot of self-control and is run as a separate club with their own committee. The team are seven-time AWIHL champions and five-time AWIHL premiers.\nSydney Sirens.\nSydney was one of the four founding teams of the AWIHL in 2007. The Sirens began in Sydney, New South Wales at the Sydney Ice Arena but over the years the team has moved around, playing at Canterbury Olympic Ice Rink, Penrith Ice Palace, Liverpool Catholic Club Ice Rink and Macquarie Ice Rink. Between 2011 and 2013 the team became a part of the Newcastle Northstars organisation and relocated to Hunter Ice Skating Stadium and was renamed North Star Sirens. When the team returned to Sydney, they reverted to their old name, Sydney Sirens. The Sirens are three-time AWIHL champions and three-time AWIHL premiers.\nPerth Inferno.\nPerth are the first ever expansion team in the AWIHL history. The Perth Inferno officially joined the league in July 2018, becoming the fifth AWIHL team. Donning purple and orange, the Inferno began as the Western Australian representative team, they went on to play two exhibition games during the 2017–18 season against the Sydney Sirens before joining the AWIHL regular season in 2018–19.\nSeason structure and rules.\nRegular season.\nThe AWIHL regular season is played between October and March each year. The regular season consists of 30 games in total, with each team playing twelve games. Each team will play two games every scheduled weekend during the regular season. There is no overtime period played in the AWIHL regular season. In the event of a tied score at the end of regulation time, a penalty shootout will determine the winner of a game. If there is no time for a shootout to occur, a draw will be declared.\nGame length.\nThe AWIHL has adopted the international standard three 20-minute stop-time periods length for all regular season and finals regulation time periods. The AWIHL was the first national competition under Ice Hockey Australia to implement these international standards in 2018–19. Prior to 2018–19, the AWIHL played 54 minute games, with 17 minutes played in each of the first two periods, followed by a full 20 minute third period. Teams are allowed a minimum of 5 minutes warm-up before each game and are allowed one 30 second timeout during regulation game time.\nGame rules and points system.\nThe AWIHL has adopted the current International Ice Hockey Federation Official Rule Book for playing rules. The AWIHL points system, follows similar systems widely used in Europe. 3 points is awarded for a regulation time win, 2 points for a shootout win, 1 point for a shootout loss and 0 points for a regulation time loss. In the unlikely event of a draw, both teams will be awarded 1 point each.\nImport rules.\nAWIHL teams are allowed to sign a maximum of four imports for their team's roster for any given season. Teams are allowed to dress a maximum of three imports for any given AWIHL game with one exception, the team who finished last in the league standings the season before is allowed to dress all four imports for any given AWIHL game. Import goaltenders is prohibited in the AWIHL. This regulation was implemented to support the Australian national women's teams.\nAn import is defined as someone without Australian citizenship or permanent residency. New Zealand residents who move to Australia under the Trans-Tasman Travel Arrangement are counted as imports for the first two consecutive seasons, after that they are exempted from the import rules and count as a ‘local’ player. If they cease to live permanently in Australia, they lose their exemption status and must start the process over.\nPlayoffs.\nPlayoffs are known in the AWIHL as the Finals. They are played over a single weekend in a chosen location. The AWIHL Commission chooses the finals location. The Finals Weekend involves four games in total, two semi-finals played on the Saturday followed by a third-place playoff and grand final on the Sunday. The top four tams from the regular season qualify for the finals weekend. The top seed plays the fourth seed in the first semi final followed by two verses three in the second semi. Unlike in the regular season, overtime can be played in finals games. The AWIHL implements a 4v4 stop time overtime period of 10 minutes in accordance with the IIHF Rule Book. The winner of the grand final is named AWIHL champion and lifts the Joan McKowen Memorial Trophy and has their name inscribed on the original trophy, retained in the IHA Office. Gold, silver and bronze medals are given to rostered players and team officials on the teams who finish first, second and third in finals.\nLeague champions.\nAWIHL champions by seasons (2006–present).\nReferences: \nTrophies.\nJoan McKowen Memorial Trophy.\nSince 2010–11, the Joan McKowen Memorial Trophy has been the highest title honour in the AWIHL. The trophy is awarded to the AWIHL champions, the team that wins the grand final of the finals weekend (playoffs) at the end of each season. The trophy is named after Joan McKowen, who was a prominent figure in Australian Ice Hockey before her death in 1992. Her husband, Maxwell McKowen donated the trophy for its first use as the prize for the annual national women's ice hockey tournament in 1995.\nStephanie Boxall Trophy.\nTaking over from the West Lakes Trophy in 2020, is the Stephanie Boxall Trophy. The trophy is awarded to the winner of the minor premiership in the AWIHL, the team that finishes top of the league standings at the conclusion of the regular season. The trophy is named after Stephanie Boxall, who was a pioneer of the women's game in Australia. Originally playing boys before the women's game was established, Steph took on the sport's ruling body in the 1980s and won the right for women to continue to participate in men's ice hockey after the national body tried to ban women due to fears of being sued if a woman got hurt. This helped paved the way for the establishment of the women's game in Australia. Steph was an inaugural member of the Australian national team and National Women's Championship when it started in 1995. She went on to captain Australia and has been called the “best female ice hockey player Australia has ever had”. Steph is the first Australian, and is one of only six women, to be named in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto, Canada.\nFormer trophies.\nWest Lakes Trophy.\nFor the first three seasons of the AWIHL, between 2007–08 and 2009–10, the West Lakes Trophy was the championship trophy for the league. However, in 2010–11, the AWIHL secured and introduced the Joan McKowen Memorial Trophy for the championship. The West Lakes Trophy was subsequently re-purposed to become the minor premiership trophy for AWIHL teams who finish top of the regular season standings at the end of each season. But this was later replaced by the Stephanie Boxall Trophy.\nIndividual awards.\nEach season, ahead of, or at, the beginning of the AWIHL Finals, the league announces the winners of the individual player awards that recognises excellence across a number of different categories.\nReferences:"

The season featured 12 teams from across England and Scotland including a new entrant, the reformed Manchester Giants, who were based on the original franchise of the same name that folded in 2001. East London Royals were due to become the 13th member of the League, but after their financial backing fell through weeks before the start of the season, the League deferred their entry until the 2013–14 season. The pre-season also saw long-time member franchise Milton Keynes Lions relocate to London and rebrand itself as the London Lions, whilst Cheshire Jets – encountering severe financial difficulties and threatened with the franchise being dissolved – were saved by campaigning local fans and businessmen and renamed as Cheshire Phoenix midway through the season.\nThe Championship regular season commenced on 21 September 2012 with reigning Champions Newcastle Eagles beginning the defence of their title with a 72–65 victory over Glasgow Rocks. The regular season saw all teams face each other three times during the campaign, playing either two games at home and once on the road or vice versa, with the top-eight placed teams advancing to the play-offs, which took place in April 2013. The season climaxed on 28 April with the showpiece Play-off Final, which returned to its former home at Wembley Arena, for the first time since 2002. Leicester Riders dominated the campaign, and were successful in three of the BBL's four annual competition's, claiming the League title, BBL Cup and Play-off title.

The ODI series was reduced due to Australian Cricketers' Association (ACA) and Cricket Australia (CA) concerns about the weather in the UAE during August.\nEarlier the International Cricket Council (ICC) approved a six-match T20I series on the request of Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), but Pakistan still wanted to play an ODI series. The PCB chairman, Zaka Ashraf proposed the matches start in the evening to avoid the worst of the heat. The series was initially scheduled to take place in Sri Lanka but clashed with the dates of the Sri Lanka Premier League (SLPL) and was shifted to the UAE."

        "title": "American football in the United Kingdom",
        "text": "The sport of American football is played in the United Kingdom in domestic and international levels. Domestic games in England. Scotland and Wales are operated by British American Football Association who run the BAFA National Leagues for Adult Contact football and British Universities American Football League for the University contact game. Games in Northern Ireland are structured by American Football Ireland who are based in the Republic of Ireland. The UK has played host to games in association with the Americans' National Football League (NFL), including four regular-season NFL games, as of 2021.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe first game of organised American football to be played in the UK was scheduled to be between US Navy servicemen from the USS \"Idaho\" on 23 November 1910, in a match sponsored by the \"Daily Mirror\" known as the Silver Cup. However, after the Michigan team pulled out, they were replaced by a team from the USS \"Vermont\". The game, played at Crystal Palace, finished 19–0 to the team of the \"Idaho\". The cup was played for two more times in 1910, won once more by the crew of the Idaho, and once by the crew of the USS Georgia.\nDuring World War II, large numbers of US servicemen stationed in Europe meant that games were regularly played in the United Kingdom. The most prominent game was known as the \"Tea Bowl\", played at the White City Stadium, between US and Canadian troops. The game, watched by 30,000 spectators, saw the first half played under US rules, and the second under Canadian rules. Canada came out as 16–6 victors, including a 40-yard touchdown reception for Denis Whitaker. A rematch was hastily planned, known as the \"Coffee Bowl\", and thanks to Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Tommy Thompson, 50,000 spectators watched the US team cruise to a 18–0 victory. Thanks to the success of the Tea and Coffee Bowl games, a game between the US Army and US Navy was scheduled for 12 November 1944. The match finished 20–0 in favour of the US Army.\nFollowing the war, US forces stationed around Europe formed the USAFE League. The league ran from 1946 until being disbanded in 1993.\n1980s: Surge in popularity and foundation of a league system.\nIn 1982, terrestrial broadcaster Channel 4 began showing weekly NFL highlights, and interest in the sport surged, assisted by the problems association football was facing at the time such as hooliganism and decaying stadiums. An estimated 4 million people tuned into Super Bowl XX between the Chicago Bears and the New England Patriots.\nIt was around this time that interest in a domestic British league started, and teams were founded primarily in proximity to Air Force bases with a strong American presence, such as RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire. In 1983, the first game between two British teams, the London Ravens and the Northwich Spartans, ended in a 48–0 victory to the Ravens.\nIn February 1984, a meeting at the Post House Hotel in Bedford saw representatives of 35 teams meet to discuss the formation of an association. 26 teams attended a second meeting, and this saw the formation of two leagues – the British American Football Federation (BAFF) and the American Football League United Kingdom (AFLUK) – and soon there would be over 40 teams competing in fully kitted football. However, in part due to the recession, players and teams struggled for funding.\nIn 1985, a further conference was scheduled with the aim of merging the existing organisations. However, the two leagues were unable to resolve their differences, and a third league, the United Kingdom American Football Association, was born from the meeting in Birmingham.\nVilla Park was the site of the first British championship, between the Streatham Olympians and the London Ravens. 7,000 fans watched the London Ravens become the first British champions. It was in 1985 that the GB Lions played their first ever international game against France, coming away with a 7-0 victory.\nFollowing a study of feasibility, Budweiser announced a £300,000 fund to grow the sport in the UK. In 1986, the Leicester Falcons and the Birmingham Bulls played to determine which team would be Britain's inaugural entry into European competition. The Bulls came out on top in a 32–18 victory.\nIn the same year, the two leagues would become one after BAFL announced massive losses and began immediate liquidation. 102 teams in 18 divisions found themselves under the Budweiser banner for the coming season. 1986 also saw the first ever official NFL game at Wembley between the Chicago Bears and the Dallas Cowboys.\nThe late 1980s saw a high number of import players brought in from the US. 1989 was also a mixed year for Britball. The GB Lions saw success, winning their first European Championship, but in the national leagues, Budweiser announced the withdrawal of their sponsorship.\n1990s.\nIn 1990, the NFL established the NFL Trust, designed to develop the game further. 1990 also saw the NDMA league announce a sponsorship deal with Coca-Cola. 1991 saw the foundation of the World League of American Football, and the UK-based London Monarchs took home the inaugural World Bowl. In the same year, the GB Lions once again won the European Championship.\nIn 1992, following a demotion to the NDMA Division 2, the pioneering London Ravens folded. The WLAF was suspended until 1995, but returned with the Scottish Claymores representing the UK alongside the Monarchs.\nIn 1998, the British American Football League (BAFL) was founded to govern the game at a national level. After years of struggling, the team then known as the England Monarchs were replaced in NFL Europe by the Berlin Thunder.\nNew millennium.\nIn 2005, the last remaining British-based team in NFL Europe, the Scottish Claymores, were replaced by the Hamburg Sea Devils.\nFollowing the collapse of BAFL in 2010, the British American Football Association (BAFA) was founded to govern the National Leagues and the national team.\nDomestic leagues.\nIn England, Scotland and Wales, the domestic game is organised by the British American Football Association (BAFA), who operate a series of league competitions as the BAFA National Leagues. The championship game is known as the BritBowl.\nNorthern Irish teams compete in an amateur island-wide regional competition in Ireland, organised by the Irish American Football League (IAFL).\nAmerican football is also one of the sports organised under the umbrella of the British Universities and Colleges Sport, which operates a league competition as the British Universities American Football League.\nInternational teams.\nThe Great Britain national American football team represents the United Kingdom in international competition. There are a number of teams under the GB Lions banner; the Men's Senior team, the Students team, the U-19 team, the women's team and men's, women's and U-19 flag football teams.\nNational Football League.\nVarious games of the National Football League (NFL), the main professional league for the sport in the United States, have been played in the United Kingdom.\nAmerican Bowl.\nThe American Bowl was an NFL pre-season competition held from 1986 until 2005 in various locations around the world. The original Wembley Stadium in London hosted a total of 8 of these games in the 8 seasons from 1986 until 1993, originally being the only venue for the first three years in which the Bowl consisted of only one game, and then as one of the multiple venues as it expanded incrementally from two, three and four games.\nDevelopment league teams.\nTwo British teams competed in the NFL sanctioned development league, set up in 1991 as the World League of American Football (pausing in 1993–94), renamed NFL Europe in 1998, before eventually being disbanded in 2007. The London Monarchs competed from 1991 until 1998 (renamed England Monarchs in for their final season). The Scottish Claymores competed from 1995 to 2004.\nInternational Series.\nThe NFL International Series was inaugurated in 2007 to host NFL regular season games outside the United States. Played at the new Wembley Stadium in London (rebuilt and reopened in 2007), the series increased from one to two games for the 2013 season, to three games for the 2014 season, and then to four games from the 2017 season. In 2019, the series moved to the new home of Tottenham Hotspur, although games may still be played at Wembley Stadium.\nPotential London franchise.\nThe success of the International Series has led to speculation that London will be chosen as home of an NFL franchise in the future.\nBroadcasting.\nChannel 4 was the first British channel to broadcast American football, in 1982. Coverage of the 1982 season involved broadcasting highlights of one game a week, and culminated in the first ever live broadcast of the Super Bowl in Britain, for which Channel 4 paid NBC £100,000. The sport became so popular in the mid-1980s that the Super Bowl regularly attracted more than 4 million viewers.\nChannel 4 ceased coverage of NFL in 1997, before returning in 2010. In terms of free-to-air television, the Channel 4 deal to show 21 games of the 2014 NFL season live (17 regular season games, the three International Series games, and the Super Bowl) marked a high point in terms of number of game shown. Channel 4 opted not to renew its rights from the 2015 season after failing to reach a deal with the NFL.\nSince the 2020/21 season, Sky Sports had broadcast Sky Sports NFL. The channel is a full time service and runs for the duration of the NFL season. As well as live and recorded coverage of games, output includes simulcasts of magazine shows from NFL Network such as \"Good Morning Football\" and \"NFL Total Access\". The channel broadcasts until early February 2021. This has been repeated in subsequent years. \nSky had first shown NFL coverage in 1995 and over the years Sky had gradually built up its rights after entering the market in 1995 and by 2015, Sky Sports coverage coverage comprised 103 live games, including Thursday Night Football, Sunday Night Football and \"Monday Night Football\", plus two or three other daytime Sunday games, as well as the full post-season and the Super Bowl.\nFree-to-air coverage is currently seen on ITV which took over the terrestrial coverage of the sport after seven years on the BBC. The deal includes the rights to show two of the three NFL London Games and the Super Bowl in addition to a weekly highlights programme.\nOther channels which have previously broadcast NFL games in the UK have been Channel 5, ESPN UK and British Eurosport."

A centre, he represented Counties at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national team, the All Blacks, from 1972 to 1981. He played 102 matches for the All Blacks, including 34 internationals, and scored 30 tries, four of which were in test matches.\nRobertson played 135 matches for Counties between 1971 and 1982, making his debut for the union at the age of 19. He was the All Black centre (No 13) for much of the 1970s, and was admired for his pace, silky pass and swerve, and his thinking approach to the game.\nRobertson was regarded as one of the best centres in New Zealand rugby history. He played against all-white South African teams during the Apartheid era, in common with many All Blacks at the time. However, he declared himself unable to play against the Springboks during their New Zealand 1981 tour. This was due to his \"personal abhorrence of apartheid\", following the 1976 tour of South Africa.\nRobertson died on 12 May 2023, at the age of 71."

        "title": "2012 Tour de France, Prologue to Stage 10",
        "text": "The 2012 Tour de France began on 30 June, and stage 10 occurred on 11 July. The 2012 edition began with a prologue – a short individual time trial stage – where each member of the starting peloton of 198 riders competed against the clock – in Liège, Belgium with two more stages held in the country before moving back into France. The race resumed in Orchies for the start of the third stage; also during the first half of the race, the peloton visited Switzerland for the finish to the eighth stage in Porrentruy, and contested another individual time trial stage – having returned to France – the following day.\nFabian Cancellara held the lead of the race throughout its opening Belgian leg; having won the race-commencing prologue, Cancellara defended it on the following two stages before the race returned to France. Cancellara maintained his overall lead for the rest of the race's first week, before eventually losing time on the first true mountain stage of the race – stage seven – as he was dropped on the closing climb to La Planche des Belles Filles. As a result, Bradley Wiggins assumed the \"maillot jaune\", becoming the first British rider to wear the jersey since 2000. Wiggins maintained the lead for the following three stages, including his first victory at the Tour during the ninth stage individual time trial in Besançon. Wiggins held a lead of almost two minutes in the overall standings with the more mountainous second half of the Tour still to race. Two riders won multiple stages during the first half of the race; Peter Sagan, in his first Tour de France, won three stages and also held the lead of the points classification, while André Greipel took back-to-back stage victories on the fourth and fifth stages. World champion Mark Cavendish achieved one stage victory, while French riders Thibaut Pinot and Thomas Voeckler each took breakaway victories.\nThe race was also marked by several large crashes, most notably on the sixth stage, when the majority of the field crashed with around remaining. In total, twelve riders had to abandon the race due to injuries suffered during the crash. During the race's first rest day – held after the ninth stage individual time trial – the team hotel of the squad, in Bourg-en-Bresse, was searched by French police and gendarmerie. One of team's riders in the Tour, Rémy Di Gregorio, was arrested in relation to an ongoing anti-doping case, and was immediately suspended by the French team; although the case had been open since 2011, when Di Gregorio was a member of the team.\nPrologue.\n30 June 2012 — Liège (Belgium), , (ITT)\nThe prologue was a short and fairly flat circuit around Liège, with expected stage times to be about eight minutes. The start ramp was located at Avenue Rogier next to the Parc d'Avroy; the riders then headed north by the Boulevard d'Avroy and Boulevard de la Sauvenière. They then followed the Quai Roosevelt, along the Meuse, until the midway point when they returned on the opposite carriageway, before turning right towards Place Saint-Lambert, in front of the Palais des Princes-Évêques. From there, the riders rejoined the original route on the opposite carriageway of Boulevard de la Sauvenière before the finish line located on Boulevard d'Avroy on the opposite side of the Parc d'Avroy from the start.\nWith several tight corners, the prologue was expected to favour riders with good bike handling skills. The first rider to leave the start house in Liège was 's Tom Veelers, with most of the general classification contenders going towards the end of the starting order, as rain was not scheduled to disrupt the race. Veelers set a time of 7' 47\" for the course – which was near-identical to the 2004 prologue held in the city, won by then- rider Fabian Cancellara, over a parcours – but this was immediately beaten by rider Simon Gerrans, who went five seconds quicker around the course. Gerrans' lead was also not to last for long, as Ukrainian national champion Andriy Hryvko () bettered his mark by 14 seconds; the time was ultimately good enough for tenth place in the stage results. Hryvko held the lead for over an hour, as no other rider could get within three seconds of his time at that point.\nIt was not until Gerrans' teammate Brett Lancaster, a former prologue winner at the Giro d'Italia, that Hryvko's time was beaten; Lancaster recorded a time four seconds quicker, crossing the line at 7' 24\". rider Edvald Boasson Hagen marginally bettered Lancaster's time to assume the lead for a time, but French champion Sylvain Chavanel () set a mark of 7' 20\" for the course. His time held until the final ten riders to take to the course; Bradley Wiggins () trailed Chavanel by six seconds at the intermediate time-check – coming around halfway through the test – but paced the second half better to negate the deficit, and beat the time of Chavanel by around half a second. Cancellara, the pre-stage favourite, recorded the fastest time of 3' 35\" to the intermediate point, and extended his eventual stage-winning margin to seven seconds by the finish; in the process, Cancellara won his fifth Tour prologue stage, a record.\nOf other overall contenders, defending champion Cadel Evans (), 's Vincenzo Nibali and rider Ryder Hesjedal, the winner of May's Giro d'Italia, all placing solidly inside the top twenty riders. Nibali's teammate Peter Sagan and world time trial champion Tony Martin (), who both had been tipped as favourites to win the stage, both encountered difficulties on the course during their respective runs. Sagan lost time after he overshot one of the 180-degree hairpin bends and had to clip out of the pedals, while Martin – who had set a similar time to teammate Chavanel at the intermediate time-check – suffered a puncture, and ultimately finished 23 seconds down on Cancellara's time.\nStage 1.\n1 July 2012 — Liège (Belgium) to Seraing (Belgium), \nThe Tour remained in Belgium for the first full day's racing with a stage through the rolling countryside of the Ardennes. After four Category 4 climbs en route, the race finished at Seraing, a municipality just outside Liège. The finish was at the top of a long and fairly steep drag – the Côte de Seraing – rising for at an average of 4.7%, which was expected to suit the race's puncheurs such as rider Philippe Gilbert, who won a similar finish in the opening stage of the 2011 Tour at Mont des Alouettes.\nSix riders – Yohann Gène (), rider Pablo Urtasun, 's Maxime Bouet, Nicolas Edet of , Anthony Delaplace () and rider Michael Mørkøv – advanced clear of the main field in the early running of the stage; the sextet managed to extend their advantage to a maximum of almost five minutes around a quarter of the way through the stage. By this point, Mørkøv and Urtasun had both scored a point towards the mountains classification, having led over the Côte de Cokaifagne and the Côte de Francorchamps respectively. Overall leader Fabian Cancellara was being paced by his teammates, and help to stabilise the gap to the leaders at around three minutes. Mørkøv then proceeded to win the two remaining climbs on the day, to take the race's first polka-dot jersey, becoming only the third Danish rider to have held the lead of that classification.\nThe breakaway also scored the major points at the stage's intermediate sprint point in Érezée, where Gène took the honours ahead of Urtasun and Edet, while in the main field, 's Matthew Goss out-sprinted his former teammates Mark Cavendish () and André Greipel () for seventh place. were joined by Gilbert's squad in order to reduce the lead advantage; it was cut to around a minute with to go, and the break was eventually caught inside of remaining. The field remained together onto the Côte de Seraing, but halfway up the climb, Cancellara attacked and only Peter Sagan () could hold pace with him. 's Edvald Boasson Hagen later bridged up to the duo, and it was left to the three riders to fight it out for the stage win, with the reduced peloton chasing behind. Cancellara attacked first, but Sagan came around the outside and freewheeled to his fourteenth victory of 2012, ahead of Cancellara – who maintained his overall lead – and Boasson Hagen. Gilbert led home the peloton in fourth, as 22-year-old Sagan became the youngest rider to win a Tour stage since Lance Armstrong in 1993.\nStage 2.\n2 July 2012 — Visé (Belgium) to Tournai (Belgium), \nThe race remained in Belgium for one more day with a flat course heading almost due west from Visé. There was one fourth-category climb of the Côte de la Citadelle de Namur during the stage, but it was expected to ultimately result in a sprint finish in Tournai. Three riders – French pairing Anthony Roux of and rider Christophe Kern, along with Michael Mørkøv (), wearing the polka-dot jersey as mountains classification leader following his part in the breakaway on the first stage – went clear around after the start of the stage, making the early breakaway from the field, and the trio managed to extend their advantage over the main field to around eight minutes, around later.\n took up duties at the front of the peloton in order to reduce the gap that the leaders had held; although by the time that Mørkøv scored the point for crossing the summit of the Côte de la Citadelle de Namur first, around later, the lead had only been reduced to around six-and-a-half minutes. Again, the breakaway took top points on offer at the intermediate sprint point in Soignies, with Kern taking maximum points for for the second successive day. None of the trio elected to contest the sprint, while back in the main field, Matthew Goss () again won the sprint contest for fourth place ahead of rider Mark Renshaw, Mark Cavendish of and the previous day's stage winner, 's Peter Sagan. With around remaining of the stage, Roux attacked his two fellow breakaway companions, going off on his own as Mørkøv and Kern allowed themselves to fall back into the confines of the main field.\nRoux managed to gain an advantage of almost a minute, but he too was brought back by the main field inside the final of the stage. , and held the front with sprinter Marcel Kittel falling off the back of the field, as he was suffering from stomach problems; instead their focus would be left with his lead-out man Tom Veelers. The field remained together for the sprint finish in Tournai; led it out for Greipel, with Sagan just behind. Cavendish moved up the order, behind two other riders – 's Daryl Impey and rider Óscar Freire – and slid in behind Greipel with around to go. Cavendish launched his sprint off Greipel's wheel with left, and got the better of him by half a wheel to take his 21st Tour stage victory, moving out of a tie with Luxembourg's Nicolas Frantz for sixth place on the all-time Tour stage wins list. Greipel, Goss, Veelers and 's Alessandro Petacchi completed the top five on the stage, with Sagan taking the points classification lead, and the green jersey, from 's Fabian Cancellara with sixth place. Cancellara maintained his seven-second overall lead over Cavendish's teammate Bradley Wiggins.\nStage 3.\n3 July 2012 — Orchies to Boulogne-sur-Mer, \nFollowing its three-day opening salvo in Belgium, the Tour moved back to France, starting in Orchies – where the fifth stage team time trial of the 1982 race was abandoned in progress due to industrial action – before heading west towards Boulogne-sur-Mer. There were six climbs within the closing of the parcours – all long or shorter – including the final long climb up to the finish, with an average gradient of 7.4%. Like the first stage, the course was ideally favoured towards the puncheurs.\nThere was a fast-paced start to the stage with several short and punchy attacks, but were closed down immediately. However, a five-rider move was allowed to be initiated after , with 's Sébastien Minard, Rubén Pérez of , Andriy Hryvko representing the team, rider Michael Mørkøv – continuing his run of being in the breakaway in each of the road stages so far – and Giovanni Bernaudeau of all breaking free, quickly gaining a lead of around two minutes. Their lead eventually reached a maximum of over five-and-a-half minutes before and made their presence at the front of the peloton, for their respective classification leaders Fabian Cancellara (overall) and Peter Sagan (points). The breakaway again scored the major points at the intermediate sprint point in Senlecques; rider Mark Cavendish won the bunch sprint for sixth place, despite being boxed in by 's Kenny van Hummel, with the two riders later exchanging words.\nMørkøv extended his mountains lead by crossing each of the first two climbs ahead of his rivals, while behind, several large crashes in the peloton took down a number of riders. Two riders suffered fractures and had to abandon on the route: 's Kanstantsin Sivtsov (tibia) and 's José Joaquín Rojas (collarbone). Mørkøv and Hryvko dropped their breakaway companions, and managed to hold off until to go when Mørkøv cracked on the Côte du Mont Lambert. Hryvko held off until the top of the climb, where he was then caught himself. 's Sylvain Chavanel attacked with to go, and at one point, put fifteen seconds between himself and the field, but he was caught before the finish by the -led field. Sagan comfortably took the sprint for the line, holding enough of a lead to free-wheel the closing metres and performing a \"running man\" salute akin to Tom Hanks's character in 1994 film \"Forrest Gump\". A one-second time difference between Sagan and the field – led home by 's Edvald Boasson Hagen, Peter Velits () and Cancellara – was announced by the organisers, with all riders that were delayed in a crash in the closing metres, given the same time as Boasson Hagen et al.\nStage 4.\n4 July 2012 — Abbeville to Rouen, \nThe first half of the stage followed the coast of Picardy and Normandy along the English Channel through Dieppe to the intermediate sprint point of Fécamp, before turning inland towards the finish at Rouen, with four fourth-category climbs during the parcours. The wind on the coast was expected to have an influence on the race, while the two tight turns to get over the Guillaume le Conquérant Bridge with to go, were potentially disruptive for the lead-outs ahead of an expected sprint finish along the quayside in Rouen.\nA three-rider breakaway was formed in the early kilometres of the stage, with the riders all representing French-licensed Professional Continental teams. Home riders David Moncoutié () and Anthony Delaplace () were joined by Japan's Yukiya Arashiro representing , as they set about gaining an advantage of over eight-and-a-half minutes from the main field. On the day, Moncoutié and Delaplace would ultimately share the four categorised climbs between them, each scoring two points towards the mountains classification; while Arashiro, the best sprinter among the trio, took maximum points at Fécamp. The now-customary bunch sprint for the minor points was again taken by 's Mark Cavendish, after launching his sprint off the rear wheel of 's Matthew Goss. 's Mark Renshaw just edged out points leader Peter Sagan of for sixth place points. A light rain shower hit the race with around remaining, before the first crash of the day with 's Jonathan Cantwell and Sagan's teammate Vincenzo Nibali among those delayed, but both would later rejoin the main field.\nThe lead gap continued to dwindle as the race wore on, with Delaplace eventually leaving his breakaway companions behind with to go. Six more riders looked to join the leading trio but all riders were eventually brought back ahead of the finish. Inside the final , another crash took down a number of riders including Cavendish and lead-out man Bernhard Eisel, as well as the duo Robert Hunter and Tyler Farrar. The final sprint was between the sprint trains of , and ; Jürgen Roelandts, Marcel Sieberg and Greg Henderson set the tempo for André Greipel to lead it out from the front, and Greipel achieved a stage victory at the Tour for the second consecutive year, the first such occurrence for a German rider since Erik Zabel. Alessandro Petacchi () beat 's Tom Veelers to the line for second, with Goss and Sagan – the latter despite being delayed by the late-stage crash – rounding out the top five.\nStage 5.\n5 July 2012 — Rouen to Saint-Quentin, \nThis was a very flat day's racing heading in a north-easterly direction with no rated climbs, with a wide straight finish in the Champs-Élysées Park. As a result, the stage was expected to favour the sprinters. Almost immediately after the peloton rolled out of the start in Rouen, 's Mathieu Ladagnous, was the first rider to break the confines of the main field and was allowed to go clear without resistance. He was joined by three more riders over the next few kilometres, as Pablo Urtasun of , 's Julien Simon and rider Jan Ghyselinck provided assistance, and soon the quartet held an advantage of 5' 30\" after of the stage.\nIt was at that point that Marcel Kittel, 's main sprinter, abandoned the race due to his ongoing gastroenteritis. The leaders held an advantage of around three minutes as they approached the intermediate sprint point in Breteuil, coming after of the parcours. Ladagnous took the maximum points on offer, as the four leaders rolled through the line without competition. As it was the previous day, Mark Cavendish () led the main field across the line, ahead of 's Matthew Goss and rider Mark Renshaw. The gap remained around the three-minute mark until to go, when it was gradually brought back by the peloton. At , the lead quartet held a lead of 20 seconds, while in the peloton, another big crash occurred; among those hitting the tarmac were points leader Peter Sagan () and 's Tyler Farrar.\nFarrar, suffering his fourth crash of the race, fell after a clash of elbows with rider Tom Veelers; after the stage, an angered Farrar tried to board the team bus to voice his feelings towards Veelers, but was escorted away by staff, including general manager Jonathan Vaughters. Ghyselinck attacked with just remaining, gaining some space from his three breakaway companions. He faded on the finishing incline, as Urtasun and Ladagnous both passed him; Urtasun was ultimately passed by the sprinters with to go. Goss launched his sprint first, with Ghyselinck's teammate Samuel Dumoulin on his wheel; but for the second stage running, it was André Greipel () who took victory ahead of Goss, 's Juan José Haedo, Dumoulin and Cavendish. 's Fabian Cancellara maintained the yellow jersey – earning the 27th of his career – which set a record for a rider not to have won the Tour, surpassing France's René Vietto.\nStage 6.\n6 July 2012 — Épernay to Metz, \nThis was the last flat stage before the race entered the mountains; during the parcours, there was one fourth-category climb of the Côte de Buxières, around after the intermediate sprint point, coming at in the commune of Saint-Mihiel. The race finished near the Centre Pompidou where another bunch sprint was expected. Once again, it was a four-rider breakaway that was allowed to be instigated in the early kilometres. David Zabriskie () was the first rider to go off the front, and he was later bolstered by 's Davide Malacarne, rider Romain Zingle and 's Karsten Kroon, who joined him after around of racing. They later established a maximum lead of around six-and-a-half minutes early in the stage.\nAround into the stage, there was a minor crash involving the winner of the previous two stages, André Greipel (), and overall contenders Robert Gesink () and Alejandro Valverde () amongst others. Greipel suffered a dislocated shoulder in the crash, although all riders would later rejoin the main field; Greipel did not contest the intermediate sprint for points, where Kroon led over the line in the breakaway, while behind, it was 's Matthew Goss that took the most available points from the main field – eleven for fifth – ahead of 's Mark Cavendish and points leader Peter Sagan of . Zabriskie crossed the summit of the Côte de Buxières first to claim the point on offer for the mountains classification, while in the peloton, there was another minor crash; Greipel was involved again, as were his teammate Jelle Vanendert and 's Bauke Mollema. Again, the peloton splintered due to the crashes, but due to a reduction in pace, those delayed were able to rejoin the main field.\nWith of the day's stage remaining, a much larger crash delayed the majority of the field. According to 's Danilo Hondo, the crash was caused by his teammate Davide Viganò while adjusting his jersey and fell into a ditch, causing other riders to stack up behind. Amongst the riders that were delayed by the crash were Fränk Schleck (), Steven Kruijswijk (), Gesink, Mollema, Valverde, Vanendert, 's Michele Scarponi, 's Pierre Rolland and the entire team with the exception of Zabriskie. Cavendish was also delayed, but although he was able to avoid the crash, he picked up a puncture in the process. Four riders abandoned the race on the route due to injuries suffered; 's Tom Danielson – who had already been racing with a separated shoulder – suffered trauma to his other shoulder, hip and arm, and was sent to hospital; he was joined there by Viganò (damaged shoulder), 's Mikel Astarloza (dislocated elbow), and 's Wout Poels, who tried to ride on for but eventually had to abandon; he was later diagnosed with a ruptured spleen and kidney, as well as three broken ribs and bruised lungs. After completing the stage, 's Óscar Freire (broken rib and punctured lung), Imanol Erviti of the (\"loss of muscle mass\"), and Maarten Wynants of (broken ribs and punctured lung) had to withdraw as well.\nAfter the crash, the race had split into many distinct groups; the breakaway still held a minute's lead over a reduced peloton of around sixty riders, with those delayed in several more groups a few minutes and more behind. With nearly all of their riders able to get through the chaos, took up pace-making on the front of the peloton, in the hopes of getting Goss the stage victory. The breakaway held a 15-second lead with to go, but it took until the final to catch them, with Zabriskie holding off to remaining. This set up the sprint, with Goss going first, while Sagan was nearly boxed in by 's Kris Boeckmans as he suffered a snapped chain with to go; he made it round him and soon passed Greipel, who faded in the closing stages, and he picked up his third stage victory of his début Tour, becoming the fifteenth rider to do so. With Edvald Boasson Hagen () and Ryder Hesjedal () among those delayed, Sagan moved into the top ten overall along with Maxime Monfort (), as Monfort's teammate Fabian Cancellara maintained the overall lead once again.\nStage 7.\n7 July 2012 — Tomblaine to La Planche des Belles Filles, \nThe race entered the high mountains with a first-time finish at at the ski resort of La Planche des Belles Filles in the Vosges. After two third-category climbs, the final climb was long and averaged 8.5% with places of the climbs reaching 14–20% in the closing stages. Following on from the crash the previous day, five more riders abandoned the race prior to the stage; Giro d'Italia winner Ryder Hesjedal of (hip and leg), was joined on the sidelines by teammate Robert Hunter (vertebrae), 's Hubert Dupont (sprained ankle, fractures to vertebrae and radius), 's Iván Gutiérrez (knee), and 's Amets Txurruka, who fractured his collarbone.\nAn initial breakaway of nineteen riders went clear after , but it was eventually reduced to seven riders, representing seven different teams, by the time the race reached the mark. They eventually established a lead of nearly six minutes around a third of the way through the stage; by the intermediate sprint point in Gérardmer, it had been reduced by a minute, as Cyril Gautier () took the twenty points for first over the line, and Peter Sagan () extended his points lead by one, as he beat Matthew Goss () in the main field sprint, for eighth place. 's Chris Anker Sørensen crossed both of the third-category climbs first ahead of 's Luis León Sánchez, but the peloton started reducing their advantage by each passing kilometre. 's Dmitry Fofonov launched an attack at the front, which dislodged Gautier from the lead group; the peloton remained a minute in arrears, with holding station and setting the tempo, protecting Bradley Wiggins from any danger.\nJurgen Van den Broeck of , rider Alejandro Valverde, and 's Robert Gesink encountered difficulties at this point, and would lose over a minute by the end of the day. Sørensen and 's Michael Albasini were the last of the leaders to be caught, with just over remaining. continued to break the peloton apart, and by the time the leaders had reached the \"flamme rouge\", only five riders remained at the front – Wiggins and his teammate Chris Froome, 's Cadel Evans, rider Vincenzo Nibali and Rein Taaramäe of – for the closing kilometre. Evans hit the final corner first, but Froome looked strongest on the steepest part of the climb, and he eventually went past him and Wiggins, accelerating away to a two-second time gap over his rivals. With 's Fabian Cancellara losing almost two minutes on the day, he surrendered the yellow jersey to Wiggins, who became the fifth British rider to wear the jersey, and first since David Millar in 2000. Froome assumed the polka-dot jersey thanks to the stage victory, while Taaramäe took the white jersey from Evans' teammate Tejay van Garderen.\nStage 8.\n8 July 2012 — Belfort to Porrentruy (Switzerland), \nThe race entered Switzerland after of the parcours, going through the Jura Mountains with a total of seven rated climbs including the first-category Col de la Croix – the summit of which was at after a , 9.2% average gradient climb – before the finish in Porrentruy. Ten riders made the immediate breakaway from the peloton, but the gap that they had achieved was closed down by the team ahead of the day's first climb, the Côte de Bondeval. Jens Voigt of attacked off the front of the lead group to take the point on offer for the mountains classification, and was joined by several more riders on the descent; however, the group only held a gap of twenty seconds at the mark.\nJérémy Roy attacked from the peloton for , and soon caught and passed Voigt on the road; while in the peloton, Samuel Sánchez () had to abandon the race, after crashing with teammate Jorge Azanza and 's Alejandro Valverde, and suffered a fractured metacarpal in his left hand. Roy was joined by rider Fredrik Kessiakoff on the day's fourth climb, the Côte de Saignelégier, while a 22-rider chase group formed behind the duo. Steven Kruijswijk () and 's Kevin De Weert left that group, and soon joined up with the two leaders on the Côte de Saulcy, before Kessiakoff left them behind, after attacking once again. He held a lead of 1' 45\" over the dwindling chase group on the penultimate climb, the Côte de la Caquerelle, and eventually the group had reduced to just French pairing Tony Gallopin () and Roy's teammate Thibaut Pinot, the youngest rider in the Tour.\nGallopin lost ground to Pinot on the final climb, and soon Pinot was chasing after Kessiakoff on the climb itself; he ultimately caught him towards the summit of the climb. Kessiakoff could not stick with Pinot on the climb, with Pinot crossing the summit with a 12-second advantage over Kessiakoff. The group of overall contenders had also been reduced, with 's Jelle Vanendert setting the tempo for teammate Jurgen Van den Broeck, around a minute-and-a-half behind Pinot. With boisterous support from his team manager Marc Madiot, Pinot maintained an advantage of a minute into the final , as Kessiakoff was swept up by the small chasing group. Van Den Broeck and Cadel Evans () looked to go clear in the closing stages, but they were brought back; while at the front, Pinot soloed to a 26-second margin of victory, ahead of Evans, Gallopin and the rest of the group. Kessiakoff took the polka-dot jersey from Chris Froome (), as Froome's teammate Bradley Wiggins maintained the overall lead into the following day's individual time trial.\nStage 9.\n9 July 2012 — Arc-et-Senans to Besançon, , (ITT)\nThe first of two lengthy individual time trial stages was fairly flat with rolling hills in the early kilometres before the parcours entered the valley of the River Doubs at Boussières. It was expected that the main contenders for the general classification were to emerge after this stage. As was customary of time trial stages, the riders set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification at the end of the previous stage. Thus, Brice Feillu of , who, in 178th place, trailed overall leader Bradley Wiggins () by one hour, eleven minutes and thirty-nine seconds, was the first rider to set off on the stage. Feillu ultimately recorded a time of 57' 33\" for the course, which was not bettered until the thirteenth rider to complete the course, rider Gustav Larsson, who recorded a time over three minutes quicker than Feillu.\nHe completed the course in a time of 54' 19\", and his time held for around an hour before his teammate Lieuwe Westra assumed top spot; despite being ten seconds down on Larsson at the second intermediate time point, Westra completed the final portion of the course some twenty seconds quicker, and recorded a time of 54' 09\". 's Tony Martin, the world champion, was the next rider to assume the top spot, setting the first time underneath 54 minutes; he set a time of 53' 40\", despite riding with a fractured scaphoid bone in his left wrist and suffering a flat tyre in the opening of the stage. Fabian Cancellara of improved the quickest time benchmark; he set the fastest time at each of the two intermediate time points on the stage, and having passed the rider who started three minutes before him on the road, 's Bauke Mollema, Cancellara established a time for the course of 52' 21\", beating Martin's time by 1' 19\".\nHis time was threatened by rider Tejay van Garderen, as he went beneath the time of Cancellara at each of the intermediate time checks, but faded towards the end and fell nine seconds outside of his target. Ultimately, only two riders beat Cancellara's time, both riding for . Chris Froome improved upon van Garderen's times at the splits, but maintained his pace until the end, setting a time half a second inside 52 minutes, beating Cancellara's time by 22 seconds. Wiggins went even quicker and by the time he had finished, he had put 35 seconds into his teammate with a time of 51' 24\", winning his first Tour stage. Wiggins also put substantial time into his major general classification rivals, as the margin on the day ranged between 1' 43\" for Cadel Evans () who finished sixth on the stage, and 3' 29\" for rider Rein Taaramäe, who was 28th and lost the white jersey as leader of the young rider classification to van Garderen.\nStage 10.\n11 July 2012 — Mâcon to Bellegarde-sur-Valserine, \nAfter a rest day, the Tour remained in the Jura Mountains, with much of the day's route the same as that followed on stage five of the 2012 Critérium du Dauphiné, including the Tour's first passage over the hors catégorie climb of the Col du Grand Colombier; a long climb, reaching an altitude of at an average gradient of 7.1%, but with sections in excess of 12%. The Tour then passed over the Col de Richemond, before the finish; the race descended towards Billiat before a gradual uphill finish in Bellegarde-sur-Valserine.\nSeveral small attacks occurred in the early kilometres of the stage, and the peloton allowed the riders to establish an advantage off the front of the main field. It eventually amounted to some twenty-five riders in the breakaway, including rider Michele Scarponi – the highest-placed rider in the group, some ten minutes in arrears of race leader Bradley Wiggins () – and the top two riders in the points classification, 's Peter Sagan and Matthew Goss of . After 's Michael Mørkøv took maximum points over the first climb of the day, the Côte de Corlier, the next focus was on the intermediate sprint point at Béon; Sagan launched his sprint first but was beaten to the line by both Goss and 's Yauheni Hutarovich, with Goss reducing Sagan's lead in the standings to 27 points. The breakaway group split apart on the Col du Grand Colombier; only Scarponi, 's Thomas Voeckler, rider Luis León Sánchez and Dries Devenyns of remained at the front.\nVoeckler crossed the summit of the climb first, taking the 25 points on offer for the hors catégorie climb. The peloton crossed five-and-a-half minutes later. Voeckler also took maximum points at the Col de Richemond, and as a result, took the polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification lead from rider Fredrik Kessiakoff. Sagan had dropped back to aid his teammate Vincenzo Nibali, who had attacked on the descent of the Col du Grand Colombier, but both riders were not to stay in front ahead of the -led peloton. 's Jens Voigt made up a minute on the lead quartet to join them, with around remaining; Devenyns looked to go clear in the closing stages, but Voeckler had kept most in hand to take his third career Tour stage victory, three seconds ahead of Scarponi and seven ahead of Voigt. Wiggins remained on the wheel of his closest rival, Cadel Evans of the , to maintain his 1' 53\" lead in the general classification into the Alps."

        "title": "Tom Wilson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Thomas Wilson (born March 29, 1994) is a Canadian professional ice hockey right winger and alternate captain for the Washington Capitals of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Capitals selected him in the first round, 16th overall, of the 2012 NHL Entry Draft.\nBorn and raised in Toronto, Ontario, Wilson began playing hockey at the age of two. He spent one year of minor ice hockey as a defenceman before switching to forward, where he could be more involved in the game. After spending time in the Greater Toronto Hockey League, the Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) selected Wilson in the second round of the 2010 OHL Draft. The following year, he helped Canada to capture gold medals at both the World U-17 Hockey Challenge and the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament. His first two seasons of junior ice hockey were limited by injuries to his wrist, knee, and knuckle, but he attracted attention during the 2012 J. Ross Robertson Cup playoffs, scoring seven goals and six assists in 13 playoff games. After the Whalers' 2012–13 season concluded, Wilson joined the Capitals for the 2013 Stanley Cup playoffs, playing in two games against the New York Rangers.\nWilson made the Capitals' roster for the 2013–14 NHL season, serving on the fourth line as an enforcer. He missed the first part of his sophomore season with a broken fibula, but continued his aggressive, physical style of play into the remainder of the season, racking up a high level of penalty minutes. As Wilson's career progressed, he began to receive criticism from other teams for hits and checks to his opponents' heads. Wilson was first fined for checking in 2016, and received his first suspension during the 2017 preseason. His and the Capitals' Stanley Cup championship in 2018 was similarly overshadowed by a number of controversial hits during the playoffs, including one to Zach Aston-Reese that resulted in a three-game suspension. The NHL elected to suspend Wilson for 20 games that October, following an illegal hit to the head of Oskar Sundqvist during a preseason game against the St. Louis Blues. It was his fourth suspension in 105 games.\nAfter serving the suspension, which was appealed and reduced to 14 games, Wilson began to retool his approach to the game, limiting his hits on his opponents and focusing instead on generating goals. During the 2018–19 NHL season, he set career highs in goals and points. In 2021, however, Wilson's performance as a power forward and enforcer came under fire from opposing coaches again after causing two serious injuries to other skaters: first Brandon Carlo of the Boston Bruins, followed by Artemi Panarin of the New York Rangers.\nEarly life.\nWilson was born on March 29, 1994, in Toronto, Ontario, the largest city in Canada. He began playing ice hockey at the age of two, when his father built an ice rink in their backyard for Wilson and his older brother Peter. Wilson grew up playing alongside the sons of National Hockey League (NHL) players such as Tom Fitzgerald, Shayne Corson, and Steve Thomas, all of whom lived in Toronto and had children around Wilson's age. Both of his parents were minor ice hockey coaches at North Toronto Memorial Arena: his father Keven coached competitive \"rep\" teams, while his mother Neville coached the more recreational house league.\nWhen he began playing minor hockey, Wilson was a defenceman, but he switched to playing forward after one year so that he could be involved in more plays. After three seasons playing AA minor hockey with North Toronto, Wilson joined the Toronto Jr. Canadiens of the Greater Toronto Hockey League (GTHL), where he scored 44 goals and 105 points in his final minor season. He also played in the GTHL for the Beresford Bisons, and split time between GTHL and his school team at Greenwood College School.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThe Plymouth Whalers of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) selected Wilson in the second round, 27th overall, of the 2010 OHL Priority Selection. The team was interested in Wilson's sizeat the time, he stood and weighted and in his physical style of play. Drafted at the age of 16, Wilson continued his education at Plymouth High School in Michigan while playing with the Whalers. Wilson took a physical, energetic approach to his junior ice hockey career at once, fighting to compete with his older teammates. His rookie 2010–11 season was limited to only 28 games after Wilson suffered a wrist injury during an international exhibition game, keeping him out of play for the second half of the season. In those 28 games, he scored three goals and three assists while racking up 71 penalty minutes.\nInjuries continued to follow Wilson in the 2011–12 OHL season, including a sprained medial collateral ligament in his knee and a fractured knuckle. The latter injury occurred during the CHL/NHL Top Prospects Game, forcing Wilson to miss three weeks of games in February. In 49 regular-season games for Plymouth, Wilson recorded 27 points and 141 penalty minutes. During the J. Ross Robertson Cup playoffs, however, he established himself as a strong forward for the team, stepping in for an injured Stefan Noesen. In 13 playoff games, Wilson scored an additional seven goals and six assists before the Kitchener Rangers defeated Plymouth.\nGoing into the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, the NHL Central Scouting Bureau ranked Wilson the 15th-highest prospect among all available North American skaters. That year, the Washington Capitals selected him in the first round, 16th overall, of the draft. On July 18, 2012, Wilson signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Capitals, with the expectation that he would continue to play with Plymouth for the following season.\nWilson began the 2012–13 season with Plymouth, scoring 36 points and recording 59 penalty minutes in his first 31 games with the team. When the NHL returned to play in January 2013 after the lockout, Wilson was invited to the Capitals' training camp, where he practiced alongside veterans like Alexander Ovechkin and Nicklas Backstrom before he was returned to Plymouth. After being drafted, Wilson's behaviour on the ice began to change: he focused on point production by emulating Tomas Holmstrom of the Detroit Red Wings, and Whalers coach Mike Vellucci discouraged Wilson from fighting, with the implication that he was too important of a prospect to suffer injury or suspension. Wilson finished his junior ice hockey career with 17 points and 41 penalty minutes in 12 playoff games.\nProfessional.\n2013–16.\nAfter the Plymouth season ended, Wilson joined the Hershey Bears, the Capitals' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. He spent three games in Hershey before being called up to the Capitals for Game 5 of the 2013 Eastern Conference quarterfinals against the New York Rangers. He debuted on May 10, 2013, playing on the Capitals' fourth line. In only his second NHL game, Wilson broke the blade on his left skate while attempting to forecheck a member of the Rangers, and had to be assisted back to the bench by forward Jason Chimera. The Rangers ultimately took the series in seven games.\nGoing into the 2013–14 NHL season, the Capitals, who were struck by the NHL salary cap, appointed Wilson and fellow 19-year-old Connor Carrick to their roster in order to save money. Although he did not score a goal in his first 10 games, the Capitals chose to retain Wilson on their roster in order to fill the enforcer role that had been left vacant when Matt Hendricks chose to sign with the Nashville Predators. Wilson took part in his first NHL fight on October 3, 2013, battling Lance Bouma of the Calgary Flames and receiving a five-minute major penalty. His first goal came on November 6, scoring the last point in a 6–2 rout of the New York Islanders. Wilson's first serious hit as an enforcer came the following month, when he charged Brayden Schenn of the Philadelphia Flyers. Wilson was ejected from the game and received a call from the NHL Department of Player Safety for the incident, but did not receive any supplemental discipline. Wilson was one of only three NHL rookies that season to appear in all 82 regular-season games, scoring 10 points while participating in 14 fights and recording 151 penalty minutes.\nOver the summer, while preparing to return to the Capitals, Wilson suffered a broken left fibula. He underwent surgery on July 8, 2014, with no expected time frame for his return to the NHL. When he joined the team at the start of the season, it was only for non-contact practice, and he was briefly assigned to Hershey for a three-game rehab stint at the end of October. When he returned to the team in November, it was on the top offensive line with Ovechkin and Backstrom, where he engaged in five fights through his first 13 games of the season. On March 27, 2015, Wilson received his first fine from the Department of Player Safety. After being warned for diving and embellishment on March 1 in a game against the Toronto Maple Leafs, Wilson was ordered to pay a $2,000 fine for the same penalty against Zach Parise of the Minnesota Wild. Wilson admitted, at the end of the season, that his leg injury had affected his stamina throughout the season; in 67 regular-season games, he scored only 17 points while posting 172 penalty minutes, and he registered only one point in 13 playoff games. Wilson also drew controversy during the playoffs for a hit on Lubomir Visnovsky of the Islanders, who had to be removed from the game. Wilson did not receive any punishment besides a two-minute minor penalty, while Islanders captain John Tavares referred to the hit as \"a complete target of a defenseless player\".\nWilson found his place on the Capitals during the 2015–16 season, logging more minutes than in the past two seasons while being called upon for penalty kill situations. His aggressive style of play, meanwhile, continued to generate more controversy. On December 10, 2015, Wilson received a five-minute major penalty and a game misconduct for boarding Brian Campbell of the Florida Panthers, a hit that led to calls for additional punishment. The following week, Wilson was given a match penalty for an illegal check to the head of Curtis Lazar of the Ottawa Senators. The penalty was rescinded upon further review after the league found that Wilson had initially made contact with Lazar's hip, and the apparent head injury was the result of whiplash. On April 29, 2016, during the 2016 Stanley Cup playoffs, Wilson was fined $2,403.67, the maximum amount allowable under the NHLPA Collective Bargaining Agreement, for a knee-on-knee collision with Conor Sheary of the Pittsburgh Penguins. The following day, he explained to reporters that the hit was an accidental result of a \"bluff check\" on Sheary. Playing on the third line for the better part of the season, Wilson scored seven goals and 16 assists in all 82 regular-season games. He dropped to the fourth line for the playoffs, scoring one assist in 12 games.\n2016–18.\nOn June 30, 2016, the Capitals signed Wilson as a restricted free agent to a two-year, $4 million contract. He told reporters that his goal for the 2016-17 NHL season was to shed his reputation as a physical player and focus more on improving his scoring. On December 31, 2016, Wilson collided with New Jersey Devils defenceman John Moore, who was carried off the ice on a stretcher and was later hospitalized with a concussion. An NHL spokesman told reporters the next day that Wilson would not be fined or suspended for the hit. Wilson's point production dropped during the 2016–17 regular season, with only 19 points in 82 games. However, his performance at the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs surpassed previous playoff appearances, with three goals in four games against the Toronto Maple Leafs. After scoring the overtime-winning goal in Game 1, Wilson scored two goals in Game 4. The Capitals ultimately lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Penguins.\nWilson received his first two suspensions during the 2017–18 preseason. First, on September 23, 2017, he received a two-game preseason suspension for interference against Robert Thomas of the St. Louis Blues. Then, on October 1, in the Capitals' preseason finale, Wilson received a four-game suspension as a repeat offender for a hit on Blues forward Sammy Blais. When he returned to the line-up, Wilson found an offensive rhythm on the top line with Ovechkin and Backstrom: in his first 13 games, he put up eight points and averaged nearly two minutes more of ice time per game than the season prior. By the end of the regular season, he had set a career-high 14 goals and 21 assists, but was also second to Micheal Haley with 187 penalty minutes. Wilson avoided a third suspension during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, when he charged Alexander Wennberg of the Columbus Blue Jackets. Department of Player Safety decided not to pursue further disciplinary action as they could not determine, based on the available cameras, whether Wilson's main point of contact was Wennberg's head.\nAs the Stanley Cup playoffs progressed, Wilson's hits on his opponents continued to draw scrutiny. On April 29, 2018, in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, Wilson made contact with the head of Penguins defenceman Brian Dumoulin, forcing the latter to leave the game. Wilson's history of suspension, combined with a growing controversy over headshots during the NHL postseason, further heated the incident, which was eventually ruled an \"unfortunate hockey play\". In the next game, Wilson's shoulder collided with the head of Zach Aston-Reese, giving the latter a concussion and a broken jaw that would require surgery. Wilson was labelled a \"headhunter\" and dirty player on social media, and received a three-game postseason suspension from the NHL. Wilson delivered a final controversial hit of the season in Game 1 of the 2018 Stanley Cup Finals, on Jonathan Marchessault of the Vegas Golden Knights. Wilson received a minor penalty for what he declared \"a good clean hit\", while Marchessault argued that the hit should be reviewed. Wilson ultimately helped take the Capitals to their first Stanley Cup victory, recording 15 total points, with at least one point in 11 of the 21 playoff games in which he appeared. This included two goals and one assist in the Cup finals, which Washington took from Las Vegas in five games. Wilson was one of several players asked to deliver a short speech during the Stanley Cup parade at the National Mall following the Capitals' victory, saying, \"They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but we brought the cup home.\" Wilson and the Capitals' successful postseason run was somewhat overshadowed by his second-round suspension, and Wilson thanked his teammates for supporting him through the \"tough situation\" and continuing in his absence.\n2018–24.\nFollowing his Stanley Cup performance, the Capitals re-signed Wilson to a six-year contract on July 27, 2018, with an average annual value of $5.17 million. On October 3, 2018, Wilson received a 20-game suspension for a preseason hit on Oskar Sundqvist of the St. Louis Blues. The impact of the hit, which left Sundqvist on the injured list, as well as the frequency of Wilson's suspensions, resulted in the long suspension length. The NHL referred to the incident, which was Wilson's fourth suspension in 105 games, as \"unprecedented\". Wilson attempted to appeal the league's decision, arguing that the head contact he made with Sundqvist was unavoidable, but the decision was upheld by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman on October 25. Following Bettman's decision, Wilson filed an additional appeal from a neutral arbitrator, and had his suspension reduced to 14 games. Wilson was allowed to play with the Capitals on November 13 for the Capitals' match against the Minnesota Wild. In the first game after his suspension, Wilson scored a goal, drew a minor penalty for goaltender interference, and engaged in a fight with Wild skater Marcus Foligno.\nOn November 30, only nine games after returning from his suspension, Wilson was ejected from a game against the New Jersey Devils for a late hit against Brett Seney. The match penalty received an automatic review, but Wilson faced no additional discipline from the Department of Player Safety. At the time of the hit, Wilson had scored seven goals in nine games and had extended his goal streak to five games. Wilson used his history of suspensions to change his approach to the ice, putting less emphasis on the physical aspect of his game and setting career highs with 22 goals and 40 points in 63 regular-season games. As the Capitals entered the 2019 Stanley Cup playoffs, however, Wilson's teammates and coaches worried that his restrained approach could not continue among the heightened tensions of postseason hockey. One of the strongest hits that he delivered, elbowing Greg McKegg of the Carolina Hurricanes during the Eastern Conference semifinals, went without penalty. The Hurricanes took the series with a double-overtime Game 7.\nWilson's shift towards point production over hits continued into the 2019–20 season, when, by the holiday break, he had reached a career high 0.68 points per game, alongside a career low 1.61 penalty minutes per game. By the time that the regular NHL season was suspended in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilson was one goal shy of his career high, with 21 goals in 68 games. When the NHL returned to play for the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs in Toronto, Wilson was one of 31 Capitals invited to play in the \"bubble\". For the second year in a row, Washington failed to advance past the first round of playoffs, falling in five games to the Islanders.\nThe 2020–21 NHL season brought more controversy for Wilson's playing style, beginning with a \"very big, and very late\" hit on Mark Jankowski of the Penguins at the end of February. This was followed by a hit on Brandon Carlo of the Boston Bruins on March 5, which resulted in Carlo being transported to the hospital in an ambulance. Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy referred to the incident as a \"predatory hit from a player who's done that before\", while Carlo's teammate Brad Marchand referred to it as a \"bullshit hit\". Although referees did not call an on-ice penalty for the hit, the Department of Player Safety later suspended Wilson for seven games, requiring him to forfeit over $300,000 of his salary to the NHL Players' Emergency Assistance Fund. On May 4, the NHL and Department of Player Safety came under fire when they chose not to suspend Wilson for a fight against New York Rangers skaters Pavel Buchnevich and Artemi Panarin. Wilson first hit Buchnevich before removing Panarin's helmet and throwing him into the ice. Panarin was forced to miss the remainder of the season, while the Rangers released a statement declaring George Parros, the head of the Department of Player Safety, \"unfit to continue in his current role\". The controversy was amplified when, the following day, Shayne Gostisbehere of the Flyers was suspended two games for a hit against Mark Friedman of the Penguins. Unlike Wilson, Gostisbehere had never before received an NHL suspension. On May 7, 2021, Wilson told reporters that he had reached out to Panarin and that he wished to move on from the incident. After scoring 13 goals and 20 assists during the regular season, Wilson opened the scoring for the 2021 Stanley Cup playoffs with a shot against Tuukka Rask of the Bruins. That goal would be the only even-strength point drawn from one of the Capitals' top-six forwards as they fell to the Bruins in five games.\nWhen Alexander Ovechkin was placed on COVID-19 protocols, Wilson, who had 13 goals and 18 assists by the midway point of the season, was named as his replacement for the 2022 NHL All-Star Game.\nOn August 4, 2023, Wilson signed a 7-year, $45.5-million contract extension with the Capitals. On November 30, in his 700th career game, Wilson scored his first career hat trick. Wilson was selected to play in the 2024 NHL All-Star Game. On March 22, 2024, Wilson was suspended for six games for high-sticking Toronto Maple Leafs forward Noah Gregor two days earlier.\nInternational play.\nWilson first represented Canada internationally at the 2011 World U-17 Hockey Challenge. Playing on the gold medal-winning Canada Ontario team, Wilson injured his wrist on a breakaway, leaving Mathew Campagna to take a penalty shot in the 5–3 win over the United States. In four games at the U-17 tournament, Wilson scored one assist and recorded six penalty minutes. That same year, Wilson represented Canada at the 2011 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, capturing another gold medal with three goals in five games.\nPlaying style and criticism.\nWilson, standing and weighing , has been described as a power forward, with a strong scoring record and a highly physical approach to the ice. Wilson's teammate on the Capitals, forward Brendan Leipsic, has said that Wilson's size gives the hits that he makes on opponents a distinctive \"crunch\", telling reporters that Wilson's particular danger lies not just in his size but the pace with which he attacks. He has also been described as an enforcer and a \"goon\", particularly in response to his May 2021 hit on Artemi Panarin. Wilson's physically-intensive style of play has been criticized by opponents and sports journalists as an artifact of an older era of NHL play. Stu Grimson, a former NHL enforcer, said, \"If you put Tom Wilson back in the '90s, the early '80s, he's just one tough son of a bitch and no one thinks twice. But the game has evolved.\" A 2021 poll found that Wilson was the most hated NHL player on social media, with 47.9 percent of his impressions trending negative and 15.3 percent categorized as neutral.\nWithin the Capitals, Wilson has found a role as a defensive-minded forward to clear the way for linemates like Alexander Ovechkin and Evgeny Kuznetsov. As a rookie playing on the fourth line, Wilson was primarily tasked with defending his teammates by initiating fights with opponents, but as his offensive skill progressed and fighting became less frequent in the NHL, Wilson became more selective about his fights, believing that he was more valuable on the ice than serving a penalty. Most of Wilson's disciplinary history came in a streak: between the 2017 and 2018 preseasons, he served four suspensions in 105 games, and then avoided suspension again until March 2021.\nPersonal life.\nWilson has been active in charity work across the mid-Atlantic, including the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Teammates for Kids Foundation, Homeward Trails Animal Rescue, and Hockey Fights Cancer. During the 2018–19 NHL season, Wilson launched a partner program with Make-A-Wish called Forty Three's Friends, which offers Capitals game tickets to Make-A-Wish children and involves a personal meet-and-greet with Wilson after the game. The following year, he expanded the program to include veterans from the United Heroes League. In 2019, the Capitals nominated Wilson for the King Clancy Memorial Trophy, given to a significant humanitarian contributor in the NHL.\nWilson is married to professional beach volleyball player Taylor Pischke. The couple began dating in 2015 after meeting at one of Pischke's volleyball tournaments, and became engaged on July 23, 2021. They were married on August 27, 2022. In 2020, shortly before the COVID-19 pandemic forced the suspension of the NHL season, the couple adopted a Labrador retriever puppy named Halle."

The previous highest ranked team they defeated was #15 Washington in 1998. Following the win over Creighton, the Broncos began to receive votes in both the AP and Coaches polls. Their win over LSU on December 14 was Boise State's first win ever against a team from the SEC. On December 30, Jr. Jeff Elorriaga set a Boise State and Mountain West record by making 10 3-pointers in a win against Corban. With 30 points against Corban, Elorriaga became the third Bronco this season to score 30 or more points (Marks 35 vs Creighton, Drmic 34 vs LSU). It is the first time in school history that three different Broncos have scored 30 points in a game during the same season. The 67-point win over Walla Walla on January 5 was the largest margin of victory in school history. The Broncos set a school record with 12 non-conference wins. On January 9, leading scorer Derrick Marks along with Mikey Thompson, Kenny Buckner and Darrious Hamilton were suspended for violation of team rules for the Mountain West opener vs Wyoming. The Broncos only played 7 players and won the game by 2. On January 23 vs Fresno State, the Broncos went 26 for 26 at the line to set a new school and Mountain West record for most made free throws without a miss. The previous conference record was 23 for 23 set by Colorado State in 2011–12. Derrick Marks and Anthony Drmic were named to the Mountain All-Conference 2nd team.

        "text": "The 2012–13 Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team represented Gonzaga University in the 2012–13 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played their home games at the McCarthey Athletic Center, which has a capacity of 6,000. The Bulldogs (also informally referred to as the Zags), were in their 33rd season as a member of the West Coast Conference, and were led by head coach Mark Few, who was in his 14th season as head coach. In the previous season, the Zags gained a record of 26–7 and reached the third round of the 2012 NCAA tournament.\nOn March 4, 2013, Gonzaga was the top-ranked team in the nation for the first time in school history. The Bulldogs were the fifth team to be ranked number one during the 2013 season.\nPreseason.\nIn 2012–13, the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team were in their 33rd season as a member of the West Coast Conference. Since 2004, the team has played their home games at the McCarthey Athletic Center, which has a capacity of 6,000. In their previous season, a West Coast Conference Preseason Poll predicted that the Gonzaga Bulldogs would finish atop of the conference. Despite the high expectations, the Zags finished second place behind Saint Mary's in the West Coast Conference Standings with a 13–3 conference record, causing its eleven-year run as regular season champions to come to an end. The Bulldogs lost in the championship game of the West Coast Conference tournament to Saint Mary's, who claimed their second tournament title in three years. The team drew a seven seed in the 2012 NCAA tournament, where they lost to two seed Ohio State in the third round, 73–66, and finished with a record of 26–7.\nBefore the 2012–13 season, the Gonzaga Bulldogs men's basketball team lost two seniors from the previous year to graduation: starter Robert Sacre and transfer Marquise Carter. Sacre was the team's third-highest scorer, with an average of 11.6 points per game, and averages of 6.3 rebounds and 1.4 blocks per game. In his final season, he was selected for the all-conference team and finished his career with 1,270 points, 679 rebounds, and 186 blocks. He would go on to be selected by the Los Angeles Lakers as the 60th overall pick in the second round of the 2012 NBA draft. Carter was a guard off of the bench, and averaged 3.8 points, 1.5 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game.\nFour players left Gonzaga voluntarily: freshmen Chris Sarbaugh and Ryan Spangler, as well as sophomores Mathis Mönninghoff and Mathis Keita. Sarbaugh redshirted in 2011–12 after coming out of high school from Gonzaga Prep, and transferred to North Idaho College. Spangler played in 22 games and averaged 6.6 minutes per game before transferring to Oklahoma. Mönninghoff was a reserve wing for the Zags and played an average of about six minutes per game before he left to play professionally in Germany. Keita played in 23 games, averaging 9.4 minutes and 2.7 points per game before he transferred to Indiana University of Pennsylvania the following season.\nOn October 29, 2012, the Bulldogs were voted by other West Coast Conference coaches as the preseason favorite to win the league, receiving seven of the nine votes. Sophomore guards Gary Bell Jr. and Kevin Pangos were selected for the All-Conference Team, as well as junior center Sam Dower and senior forward Elias Harris. Harris and Pangos were listed on the preseason Naismith Award 50-man watchlist, while Harris was also listed on the Wooden Award preseason top 50 list.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002965; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002965; color:#FFFFFF;\"| Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002965; color:#FFFFFF;\"| 2013 WCC Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#002965; color:#FFFFFF;\"| 2013 NCAA Tournament\nSeason.\nPreconference season.\nThe Gonzaga Bulldogs started their season with a 103–65 home win against Southern Utah on November 9.

Freshman Przemek Karmowski led the Bulldogs with 22 points, while senior Guy Landri Edi scored a career-high 16 points. Three days later, Gonzaga played West Virginia as a part of the ESPN College Hoops Tip-Off Marathon, where they would go on to rout the Mountaineers 84–50. They held West Virginia to 21 percent shooting in the first half, and led 45–18 at halftime. Matt Humphrey's steal and dunk cut Gonzaga's lead to 50–32 with 14:45 left, but Elias Harris responded with a three-pointer to push the lead back to 20. Gary Bell Jr. led the Bulldogs with 15 points, as four other players scored in double figures. On November 18, the Zags played at home against South Dakota, where they would beat the Coyotes 96–58. Despite having 16 turnovers and making 4 of 15 free throws, the team outscored the Coyotes 38–9 in the paint. After a slow start, the Bulldogs went on an 18–4 run midway through the first half. Karnowski had a team-high 20 points, while Harris had 16 points and a career-high 18 rebounds in the victory.\nDuring Thanksgiving weekend, the Bulldogs travelled to Lake Buena Vista, Florida to participate in the 2012 Old Spice Classic. On November 22, Gonzaga went on to beat Clemson 57–49 in the first-round game of the tournament. After being behind by as much as eight, the Zags responded with the help of David Stockton, who had a career-high seven assists. Kelly Olynyk, coming off of a redshirt year, played in his first game of the season after being suspended for the previous three games for violating the student code of conduct. The next day, the Bulldogs went on to beat Oklahoma 72–47. The Sooners never had a lead in the game, as Harris scored 14 of his 18 points in the second half. In the Old Spice Classic championship game two days later, the Zags would hold on beat Davidson 81–67 to capture its second tournament title and remain undefeated on the season at 6–0. After Davidson was ahead by as much as nine, Kevin Pangos connected on a three that made it 58–53 with eight minutes to play and scored another three two minutes later to make it 64–57. Harris finished with a team-high 24 points and 10 rebounds, while Pangos added 23 points, five assists, and two steals.\nThe team returned home to play Lewis-Clark State on November 29. They routed the Warriors 104–57, and were led by freshman Kyle Dranginis, who had a career-high 30 points, seven assists, and six rebounds. Despite sitting starters Harris and Bell, the Zags forced 20 turnovers and had a 46–20 rebounding advantage. In the teams' first meeting since 1976, the Bulldogs defeated Pacific 85–67 two days later. Despite an early 18–10 Pacific lead, Gonzaga replied with a 10–0 run later in the first half to take a 49–34 halftime lead. The frontcourt accounted for 64 of the team's points, as bench player Sam Dower scored 18 points and grabbed nine rebounds. After this, the Zags faced their first true road game of the season as they travelled to play at Washington State. Down 67–69, DaVonte Lacy made a layup for the Cougars to tie the game. With the game tied at 69, Pangos drove up the court to make a layup with two seconds left to secure the 71–69 victory. Olynyk made 10 of 14 shots and grabbed seven rebounds to keep Gonzaga in the game in the second half, while Harris led the team with 23 points. The victory gave the Bulldogs their best start to a season in Division I history with a 9–0 record.\nGonzaga suffered their first loss of the season against #13 Illinois on December 8, falling 85–74. Tied at 41 at halftime, the Zags shot 38 percent in the second half after shooting 60 percent in the first half. A free throw by Pangos cut Illinois' lead to 75–71 with 2:51 left in the game. However, the Illini responded with an 80–71 advantage to take control of the game. The Bulldogs recovered from their first loss of the season by beating Kansas State in the annual State Farm Battle in Seattle game, 68–52. The team outscored Kansas State in the paint 38–12 and limited the Wildcats to 33 percent shooting. Olynyk led the team with 20 points, while Bell added 11 points. Four days later, Gonzaga returned home and beat Campbell 74–52. The team finished with 33 points from the bench and 44 in the paint, while scoring 18 points off of 15 turnovers. Karnowski led the Zags with 14 points, while Harris put up 11 points and a career-high six assists.\nWith over a week to prepare for their next game at home, the Bulldogs beat Baylor 94–87 on December 28. The team was unable to hold a lead until there was 4:53 remaining in the first half. At that point, the game went back and forth, and the Zags led by as many as 12. Pangos led the team with 31 points, while Olynyk and Harris added 21 and 17 points, respectively. Gonzaga then went back on the road to play at #22 Oklahoma State, where they got a 69–68 win. With 35.7 seconds left in the game, Mike Hart set a screen for Bell, who made a three-pointer to give the Zags the 67–65 lead. On the following play, Olynyk fouled out and sent Marcus Smart to the free throw line. Smart missed both free throws and Pangos rebounded the ball, and subsequently was sent to the free throw line, where he made both free throws. The win made Gonzaga undefeated against the Big 12 for the season with a 5–0 record.\nConference season.\nTo begin the conference season, the Bulldogs travelled to Firestone Fieldhouse on January 3 to play Pepperdine, where they would beat the Waves 78–62. David Stockton came off the bench and keyed the Zags with four steals to hold off a Pepperdine team that was down two with 12 minutes left. Despite scoring a season-low 43.4% from the field, Elias Harris scored 18 points and Kelly Olynyk added 16. Two days later, they went to Santa Clara and beat the Broncos 81–74. The team managed to withstand a Santa Clara rally late when Olynyk made a key putback with 1:55 remaining. He led the team with a career-high 33 points and 10 rebounds, while Harris added 14 points for the Zags. After this, Gonzaga would go back home to play conference rival Saint Mary's, whom they would beat 83–78. Saint Mary's would have one field goal in the final minutes of the first half to help the Bulldogs to a 46–28 halftime advantage. However, Stephen Holt would hit three shots and two free throws in a 90-second span to cut the lead to 55–44. With 26 seconds left, Kevin Pangos missed and fouled Matthew Dellavedova, who made it 79–78. Gonzaga held on for the win and was led by 31 points from Olynyk.\nOn January 17, the Bulldogs went on the road to play Portland, whom they beat 71–49. Despite two early fouls on Olynyk in the first half, Gonzaga shot 46.6% from the field. Olynyk would come back with a strong second half to finish with 21 points, eight rebounds, one steal, and two blocks. The game extended Gonzaga's best start in school history with an eight-game winning streak. Two days later, they would travel to Hinkle Fieldhouse to play a non-conference game at #13 Butler as a part of the debut game of ESPN's \"College GameDay\" for the 2013 college basketball season. Gonzaga was ahead 33–32 at halftime, but Butler scored the first five points of the second half to take the lead. Ahead 63–62 with 3.5 seconds left, Stockton threw the ball inbounds and watched as it was stolen by Butler sophomore Roosevelt Jones, who took the buzzer beater shot to give Butler the 64–63 win. The team would recover and return home from their second loss of the season on January 24 by beating BYU 83–63. Olynyk scored 26 points on 9-for-9 shooting and was also 8-for-8 on free throws. The Zags won the rebound battle 37–29 and outscored BYU 42–28 in the paint while shooting 56.9% from the field.\nTwo days later, the team would go on to beat San Francisco at home 66–52. Despite shooting 58 percent in the first half and building a lead of 24 at one point, the Bulldogs shot just 8 of 27 in the second half. They were led by Olynyk, who had 13 points, eight rebounds, three assists, three steals, and one assist. The team then travelled to Loyola Marymount on January 31, where they would rout the Lions 88–43. The team shot 13-for-21 from behind the three-point line and shot 54.4% from the field. Gary Bell, Jr. led the team with 15 points, which were entirely three-pointers. The team would face a tougher task when they went to San Diego two days later. The Zags left 36–27 at halftime, but San Diego would go on a run to drop the Gonzaga lead to 51–50. They trailed 57–53 with 7-and-a-half minutes left before outscoring the Toreros 12–6. Stockton would hit a runner in the lane with 55.9 seconds left, but Olynyk would miss the front end of a one-and-one to give San Diego a chance to win the game with eight seconds left. However, Harris would go on to block the last-second shot to secure the 65–63 victory. Harris scored 18 points and eight rebounds, while Olynyk and Bell added 15 and 13, respectively.\nThe team would return home on February 7 to rout Pepperdine 82–56. They managed to hold Pepperdine to 36.2% from the field and also forced 21 turnovers. Gonzaga was led by Kevin Pangos, who scored 14 points, collected four assists, and had four steals.

Pangos also added 20 points, while Harris recorded a double-double with 16 points and 10 rebounds. Gonzaga's next battle would take them down to Moraga, California, where they would play the second conference game against rival Saint Mary's. Gaels point guard Matthew Dellavedova would score 19 of his 22 points in the first half, as the Gaels led the Zags 33–32 at the break. However, Gary Bell, Jr. would go on to score 20 points and fuel a 7–0 run for the opening 1:06 of the second half to take the lead for good. The team managed to shoot 50% from the field, while converting 9 of 17 three-pointers. Pangos contributed 18 points and led the team with three assists, while Olynyk added 17 points to help the Zags take control of first place in the conference with an 11–0 record.\nThe Zags then travelled to play San Francisco at War Memorial Gymnasium, which is a place where they had not won for three consecutive years. Gonzaga's defense forced San Francisco to stay on the perimeter for a majority of their shots, as the Bulldogs limited the Dons to 36.8% from the field. Olynyk led the team with 26 points and nine rebounds, while Harris added 17 points and 13 rebounds to lead the team to a 71–61 victory. A rebounding advantage of 45–22 and defensive field goal percentage of 30.2% helped Gonzaga rout Santa Clara 85–42 on February 20. The Zags shot 56.2% from the field and converted on 7 of 17 three-pointers. Harris led the team with 17 points and nine rebounds, while Olynyk scored 15. Three days later, the team beat San Diego at home 81–50. The team's defense held the Toreros to 35.7% shooting and 2-for-14 beyond the arc. Gonzaga came into the second half making its first six of seven shots to push the lead to 54–30 with 14 minutes left. After San Diego scored, transfer Drew Barham's three-pointer started a 13–0 Zags run that pushed the lead to 67–32. Pangos led the team with 18 points, while Olynyk contributed 14 points, nine rebounds, and three blocks.\nWith two conference games left, the Bulldogs travelled to play at the Marriott Center against BYU on February 28. The Zags led by 11 with 10:51 left in the game, but BYU would begin to cut the Gonzaga lead. Three three-pointers by Brock Zylstra and Craig Cusick, as well as two free throws by Brandon Davies tied the game at 60 with 4:18 remaining. Olynyk hit a key jumper with 43 seconds remaining and Pangos hit two free throws to give the Bulldogs some breathing room. However, Gonzaga fouled Cusick on a three-point attempt, causing him to make three free throws to give BYU one final chance with 6.6 seconds remaining. The Zags fouled BYU before Cusick could attempt a three, and Harris' free throws at the other end sealed Gonzaga's 70–65 victory. The final conference game of the season for the Zags would be at home against Portland two days later, whom they would beat 81–52. Harris scored 20 points, while Olynyk grabbed a double-double with 15 points and 11 rebounds. The win made the team finish undefeated in conference play at 16–0 for the first time in team history and conference history. It also broke the team's previous record for the best regular season start with 29 wins.\nPostseason.\nOn March 4, 2013, the team drew a number one ranking in both the AP Poll and Coaches' Poll for the first time in program history. In the 2013 West Coast Conference men's basketball tournament, the Bulldogs received a one seed by virtue of a 16–0 conference record, causing them to have a bye into the semifinals. Due to Loyola Marymount beating Santa Clara in the quarterfinals, Gonzaga was matched up against Loyola Marymount. The team would go on to win the game 66–48, as they were led by Elias Harris, who had 21 points, eight rebounds, one assist, two steals, and two blocks. In the championship game of the tournament, the Zags would go against rival Saint Mary's for the third time. The defense of the Bulldogs forced Saint Mary's guard Matthew Dellavedova to score two points on 1 of 8 shooting and have the Gaels shoot 35.7% from the field as a whole. The team shot 52.1% from the field and dominated the Gaels in the paint 42–18. The Zags were led by Kelly Olynyk, who contributed 21 points and 12 rebounds. Harris also added 19 points for the Bulldogs, and would later be named the MVP of the tournament. With the victory, the Bulldogs secured an automatic bid into the 2013 NCAA tournament.\nOn Selection Sunday, Gonzaga received a one seed in the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament for the first time in school history and was set to play Southern on March 21 at EnergySolutions Arena in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Jaguars previously played against the Bulldogs in an opening game for the 2010–11 season, where Gonzaga routed Southern 117–72. Despite being routed a couple of seasons before, the Jaguars were only behind 34–31 at halftime. Olynyk scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half to help Gonzaga pull ahead. Despite this, Southern managed to tie the game at 56 with 3:45 left, but Gary Bell, Jr. would hit a three-pointer to make it 59–56. On the ensuing possession, Southern guard Derick Beltran hit two free throws to cut the deficit to one. However, Kevin Pangos would respond with a three-pointer to put the Zags ahead by four. YonDarius Johnson and Malcolm Miller had open looks on the next possession, but neither was able to convert. Pangos finished with 16 points and hit two free throws with 14.3 seconds left to seal the victory for Gonzaga. The team managed to avoid the upset and hold on for the 64–58 victory to advance to the Round of 32.\nGonzaga's season came to an end on March 21 with a 76–70 loss to ninth-seeded Wichita State. The Shockers had a 36–31 lead at halftime, and were ahead by as much as 13 at one point in the game. However, the Bulldogs would respond with a 12–0 run in the second half to give themselves a 49–41 lead with 11:53 left. Nevertheless, Wichita State started a string of five straight three-pointers when Tekele Cotton hit one with 6:05 remaining, cutting the deficit to four. With 1:28 seconds left, Fred VanVleet threw up and converted on a three-pointer with one second left on the shot clock to give the Shockers a 70–65 lead. The rest of the game was a free throw shooting contest, as Wichita State shot 50% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc, converting on 14 of 28 attempts from long range. Olynyk contributed 26 points and 9 rebounds, while Pangos scored 19. The loss made the Zags the first number one seed to be eliminated as they finished with a record of 32–3.\nStatistics.\nStatistics adapted from ESPN."

        "text": "In June 2012, Wales toured Australia as part of the 2012 mid-year rugby test series. They faced Australia in a series of three internationals across the eastern states, starting at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, then moving on to Etihad Stadium in Melbourne, before finishing in Sydney at the Sydney Football Stadium. In addition, they played a tour match against one of Australia's domestic clubs, the Brumbies, at Canberra Stadium.\nBefore flying to Australia, Wales also held a one-off match at home so that Rob Howley, the caretaker coach, could finalise the squad. This was held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff against the Barbarians.\nDuring this tour, Wales were attempting to regain the James Bevan Trophy they lost in 2009, when Australia beat them 33–12 in Cardiff. They had won it the previous year, 21–18. However, the last time Wales beat Australia in Australia was in 1969, when they won 19–16.\nThis tour was the most keenly anticipated rugby tour of the 2012 tours, with Wales going into it as Grand Slam winners of the 2012 Six Nations and Australia as winners of the 2011 Tri Nations.\nWales lost the series 3–0, continuing their history of not having won in Australia for 43 years. However, all matches were close encounters, and they scored 61 points to Australia's 72. They also played a return match in Cardiff in the 2012 Autumn Internationals that ended in a similar narrow defeat, 14–12.\nIn the last three matches between the two teams, Wales led with five minutes to go and Australia snatched victory from them.\nSquads.\nWales.\nTowards the end of May, the bulk of the Welsh squad left for Australia, leaving a handful of players to face the Barbarians. After Wales' win over the Barbarians, the few players who had earned their place in the squad during the game left for Australia to join up with the team. Caretaker coach Rob Howley announced a 35-man squad to take to Australia.\nAustralia.\nRobbie Deans announced his squad to face Wales at the beginning of June. The public already knew that James O'Connor, Kurtley Beale and usual captain James Horwill would all be out of the tour due to injury. From this, Robbie Deans was able to announce his 40-man squad. On 19 June, it was revealed that Beale would return for the third and final test against Wales.\nHead coach: Robbie Deans\nTest matches.\nFirst test.\nNotes"

        "title": "Jonathan Joseph (rugby union)",
        "text": "Jonathan Byron Alexander Joseph (born 21 May 1991) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a centre for Pro D2 club Biarritz. He played more than fifty games for England between 2012 and 2020.\nEarly career.\nJoseph began his rugby career at Derby RFC. He attended The Old Vicarage School, a preparatory school in Darley Abbey, before the family moved to Berkshire. His father is originally from Grenada and represented Northampton Saints in the 1980s. His younger brother Will Joseph is also a professional rugby player who made his international debut in July 2022.\nJoseph attended Millfield and came through the London Irish academy after he spent his teenage years playing at Newbury RFC. At club level, his first senior rugby came on loan to Barnes RFC as injury cover; however, his breakthrough season was for Irish in 2010–11, when he played in thirteen Premiership games and scored five tries. His remarkable rise was marked with a nomination for the Land Rover Discovery of the Season award in 2012. He left London Irish at the end of the 2012–13 season having made 44 appearances and scored 13 tries.\nClub career.\nJoseph joined Bath at the start of the 2013–14 season and quickly forged a successful midfield partnership with inside centre Kyle Eastmond. In his first season at the club he started in their EPCR Challenge Cup final defeat to Northampton at Cardiff Arms Park.\nAfter a relatively quiet inaugural season, Joseph more than hit his straps in his second, proving to be sublime in attack and robust in defence. During their European Champions Cup match away at Stade Toulousain in January 2015, Bath showed scant regard for the French team's vast rugby pedigree and ran in four tries, with Joseph providing the catalyst for what many commentators regard as one of the finest European cup rugby tries of all time. Collecting the ball inside his own half, Joseph wriggled and side-stepped past a number of players before chipping ahead and collecting. After a searing run, again escaping the tackles of many of the Toulouse defenders, he released teammate Ross Batty, who in turn passed to Francois Louw to complete the move in scoring what was a truly audacious try. At the end of the 2014-15 season Joseph scored a try in the Premiership final as Bath finished as runners-up to Saracens.\nInternational career.\nEngland.\nJoseph progressed through the England age-grade ranks and started for the England U20 side that defeated Ireland in the final round of the 2011 Six Nations Under 20s Championship to complete a grand slam. Later that year he was a member of the squad that finished as runners-up to New Zealand in the final of the 2011 IRB Junior World Championship alongside future England teammates Mako Vunipola, Joe Launchbury, George Ford, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly and Christian Wade, amongst others. In February 2012, Joseph made his debut at England 'A' level in a defeat against Scotland.\nJoseph was one of thirteen uncapped players selected by England head coach Stuart Lancaster for the 2012 mid-year tour of South Africa. On 9 June 2012, he made his debut as a second-half substitute for Mike Brown in the first Test defeat at Kings Park Stadium. An injury to Brad Barritt allowed Joseph to start the subsequent two Tests at outside-centre alongside Manu Tuilagi. He was ruled out of the 2013 Six Nations through injury but was named to start both Test matches on the subsequent tour of Argentina.\nJoseph scored his first international try against Wales in the opening game of the 2015 Six Nations. In the next round he scored twice against Italy and was named player of the match. Joseph recorded his fourth try of the competition in the penultimate round against Scotland to finish the top try scorer of the tournament. On 14 May 2015, it was announced that Joseph had won the Rugby Players' Association 'Player's Player of the Year' and 'England Player of the Year' for his outstanding performances for both club and country during the 2014–15 season. He was included in the squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup and scored in a warm-up loss to France. He played in three of their four pool games as the hosts failed to reach the knockout phase.\nJoseph was selected by new coach Eddie Jones for the 2016 Six Nations and during the tournament scored his first hat-trick at international level away to Italy. He started all five games during the competition including the final match as England defeated France to achieve their first Grand Slam in over a decade. He scored a try in the opening game of their 2016 tour of Australia and also started the next two Tests as England completed a series whitewash. Later that year he scored tries in autumn internationals against Fiji and Australia. The following year saw Joseph accomplish another hat-trick in the penultimate round of the 2017 Six Nations against Scotland. He also started in the final game of the competition as England missed out on a consecutive grand slam with defeat away to Ireland which also brought an end to a record equalling eighteen successive Test victories. Later that year he scored another try in a victory over Australia.\nJoseph was included in the squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. He played in the quarter-final and semi-final victories over Australia and New Zealand. In the 2019 Rugby World Cup Final he came off the bench during the second-half to replace Jonny May as England were defeated by South Africa to finish as runners-up. After the World Cup Joseph won his fiftieth cap during the 2020 Six Nations and also started in the final round victory against Italy which meant England won the tournament. Later that year he played in the Autumn Nations Cup; however, a calf injury ruled him out of the final of the competition.\nBritish &amp; Irish Lions.\nJoseph was selected as one of the 41 British &amp; Irish Lions players that toured New Zealand in the summer of 2017. He did not participate in the Test series but did score a try in a tour game against Highlanders.\nHonours.\nEngland\nBath"

Jenny Naruhn, Svetlana Hess, Tilla Dier and Lisa Kropp became the first \"sport soldiers\" in the Army, which provides high-performance development for a select few male and female athletes from different sports. They undergo basic training, followed by a few military courses annually, while getting paid to train for their sport.\nAll sport soldiers were based in the Olympic Centre in Cologne from 2012. In addition to the full-time players, other national players were invited to move to the area to attend daily rugby and fitness sessions. The Olympic Centre works in conjunction with the Cologne Sport University. The number of contracted players increased to eight in 2013, with Steffi Gruber, Laryssa Stone, Alysha Stone, Julia Peters, and Vivian Bahlmann joining Hess, Kropp, and Nahrun.\nDespite these efforts, the results of the women in the European Championship tournaments deteriorated, with the team failing to even to place under the top eight teams in Europe in 2015. Weidemann resigned and was replaced by Australian Michael Hooke, while South African Melvine Smith became the U18 coach. The sports soldiers lost their Army contracts.

        "text": "The 2026 FIFA World Cup, marketed as FIFA World Cup 26, will be the 23rd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial international men's soccer championship contested by the national teams of the member associations of FIFA. The tournament will take place from June 11 to July 19, 2026. It will be jointly hosted by 16 cities in three North American countries: Canada, Mexico, and the United States. The tournament will be the first hosted by three nations and the first North American World Cup since 1994. Argentina is the defending champion.\nThis tournament will be the first to include 48 teams, expanded from 32. The United 2026 bid beat a rival bid by Morocco during a final vote at the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow. It will be the first World Cup since 2002 to be hosted by more than one nation. With its past hosting of the 1970 and 1986 tournaments, Mexico will become the first country to host or co-host the men's World Cup three times. The United States last hosted the men's World Cup in 1994, whereas it will be Canada's first time hosting or co-hosting the men's tournament. The event will also return to its traditional northern summer schedule after the 2022 edition in Qatar was held in November and December.\nFormat and expansion.\nStarting with this edition, the FIFA World Cup expanded to 48 teams, an increase of 16 from the previous seven tournaments. The teams will be split into 12 groups of 4 teams, with the top 2 of each group and the eight best third-placed teams progressing to a new round of 32, as approved by the FIFA Council on March 14, 2023. This is set to be the first expansion and format change since 1998.\nThe total number of games played will increase from 64 to 104, and the number of games played by teams reaching the final four will increase from seven to eight. The tournament will last 39 days, an increase from 32 days of the 2014 and 2018 editions. Each team will still play three group matches. The final matchday at club level for players named in the final squads is May 24, 2026; clubs have to release their players by May 25, with exceptions granted to players participating in continental club competition finals up until May 30. The 56 days of the combined rest, release, and tournament periods remains identical to the 2010, 2014 and 2018 tournaments.\nThe expansion to 48 teams had already been approved on January 10, 2017, when it was decided that the tournament would include 16 groups of 3 teams, and 80 matches in total, with the top two teams of each group progressing to a round of 32. Under this format, the maximum number of games per team would have remained at seven, but each team would have played one fewer group match than before. The tournament still would have been completed within 32 days. This format was chosen over three other proposals, ranging from 40 to 48 teams, from 76 to 88 matches, and from one to four minimum matches per team.\nCritics of this format argued that the use of three-team groups with two teams progressing significantly increased the risk of collusion between teams. This prompted FIFA to suggest that penalty shoot-outs may be used to prevent draws in the group stage, although even then some risk of collusion would remain, and a possibility would emerge of teams deliberately losing shootouts to eliminate a rival. To address these concerns, FIFA continued considering alternative formats.\nThe general idea of expanding the tournament had been suggested as early as 2013 by then-UEFA president Michel Platini, and also in 2016 by FIFA president Gianni Infantino. Opponents of the proposal argued that the number of games played was already at an unacceptable level, that the expansion would dilute the quality of the games, and that the decision was driven by political rather than sporting concerns, accusing Infantino of using the promise of bringing more countries to the World Cup to win his election.\nHost selection.\nThe FIFA Council went back and forth between 2013 and 2017 on limitations within hosting rotation based on the continental confederations. Originally, it was set that bids to be host would not be allowed from countries belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments. It was temporarily changed to only prohibit countries belonging to the confederation that hosted the previous World Cup from bidding to host the following tournament, before the rule was changed back to its prior state of two World Cups.\nThe FIFA Council made an exception to potentially grant eligibility to member associations of the confederation of the second-to-last host of the FIFA World Cup in the event that none of the received bids fulfill the strict technical and financial requirements. In March 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino confirmed that \"Europe (UEFA) and Asia (AFC) are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Russia and Qatar in 2018 and 2022 respectively.\" Therefore, the 2026 World Cup could be hosted by one of the remaining four confederations: CONCACAF (North America; last hosted in 1994), CAF (Africa; last hosted in 2010), CONMEBOL (South America; last hosted in 2014), or OFC (Oceania, never hosted before), or potentially by UEFA in case no bid from those four met the requirements.\nCo-hosting the FIFA World Cup—which had been banned by FIFA after the 2002 World Cup—was approved for the 2026 World Cup, though not limited to a specific number but instead evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Also for 2026, the FIFA general secretariat, after consultation with the Competitions Committee, had the power to exclude bidders who did not meet the minimum technical requirements to host the competition. In March 2022, Liga MX president Mikel Arriola claimed Mexico's involvement as cohost could have been at risk if the league and the federation had not responded quickly to the Querétaro–Atlas riot between rival fans that left 26 spectators injured and resulted in 14 arrests. Arriola said FIFA was \"shocked\" by the incident but Infantino was satisfied with the sanctions handed down against Querétaro.\nCanada, Mexico, and the United States had all publicly considered bidding for the tournament separately, but the United joint bid was announced on April 10, 2017.\nVoting.\nThe voting took place on June 13, 2018, during the 68th FIFA Congress in Moscow, and it was opened to all 203 eligible members. The United bid won with 134 valid ballots, while the Morocco bid received 65 valid ballots. Iran voted for the option \"None of the bids\", while Cuba, Slovenia, and Spain abstained from voting. Ghana was suspended by FIFA due to a corruption scandal and was therefore ineligible to vote.\nVenues.\nDuring the bidding process, 41 cities with 43 existing, fully functional venues with regular tenants (except Montreal) and 2 venues under construction submitted to be part of the bid (3 venues in 3 cities in Mexico; 9 venues in 7 cities in Canada; 38 venues in 34 cities in the United States). A first-round elimination cut nine venues and nine cities. A second-round elimination cut an additional nine venues in six cities, while three venues in three cities (Chicago, Minneapolis, and Vancouver) dropped out due to FIFA's unwillingness to discuss financial details. After Montreal dropped out in July 2021 due to lack of provincial funding and support to renovate the Olympic Stadium, Vancouver rejoined the bid as a candidate city in April 2022, bringing the total number to 24 venues, each in its own city or metropolitan area.\nOn June 16, 2022, the sixteen host cities (2 in Canada, 3 in Mexico, 11 in the United States) were announced by FIFA: Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Guadalajara, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Monterrey, Mexico City, Toronto, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia, and Miami. Eight of the sixteen chosen stadiums have permanent artificial turf surfaces that are planned to be replaced with grass under the direction of FIFA and a University of Tennessee–Michigan State University research team. Four venues (Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, and Vancouver) are indoor stadiums that use retractable roof systems, all equipped with climate control while a fifth, Los Angeles, is open-air but has a translucent roof and no climate control. The host of the final match—MetLife Stadium—was announced by FIFA on February 4, 2024.\nAlthough there are soccer-specific stadiums in Canada and the United States, the largest dedicated soccer-specific stadium in the U.S., Geodis Park in Nashville, seats 30,000, which falls short of FIFA's minimum of 40,000 (Toronto's BMO Field is being expanded from 30,000 to 45,500 for this tournament). Stadiums including Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Gillette Stadium in Foxborough and Lumen Field in Seattle are used by National Football League (NFL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) teams. Although primarily used for gridiron football, with the American stadiums having hosted NFL teams, and Canada's stadiums hosting the Canadian Football League (CFL), all of the Canadian and American stadiums have been used on numerous occasions for soccer and are also designed to host that sport.\nMexico City is the only capital of the three host nations chosen as a venue site, with Ottawa and Washington, D.C., joining Bonn (West Germany, 1974) and Tokyo (Japan, 2002) as the only capital cities not selected to host World Cup matches. Washington was a host city candidate but, due to the poor state of FedExField, combined its bid with nearby Baltimore's, which was also unsuccessful. Other cities eliminated from the final hosting list were Cincinnati, Denver, Nashville, Orlando, and Edmonton. Ottawa's candidate venue, TD Place Stadium, was eliminated early on due to insufficient capacity. None of the stadiums used in the 1994 FIFA World Cup will be used in this tournament, and the Azteca is the only stadium in this tournament that was used in the 1970 and 1986 FIFA World Cups.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nThe United Bid personnel anticipated that all three host countries would be awarded automatic berths. On August 31, 2022, FIFA President Gianni Infantino confirmed that six CONCACAF teams will qualify for the World Cup, with Canada, Mexico, and the United States automatically qualifying as hosts. This was confirmed by the FIFA Council on February 14, 2023.\nImmediately prior to the 67th FIFA Congress, the FIFA Council approved the slot allocation in a meeting in Manama, Bahrain. This includes an intercontinental play-off tournament involving six teams to decide the last two FIFA World Cup spots.\nThe six teams in the play-offs will comprise one team from each confederation excluding UEFA, and one additional team from the confederation of the host countries (CONCACAF). Two of the teams will be seeded based on the World Rankings, and they will play-off against the winners of two knockout games between the four unseeded teams for the two FIFA World Cup berths. The four-game tournament is to be played in one or more of the host countries, and will also be used as a test event for the FIFA World Cup. The ratification of slot allocation also gives the OFC a guaranteed berth in the final tournament for the first time: the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be the first tournament in which all six confederations have at least one guaranteed berth. This will also be the first time since the 2010 edition in which all continents have a team qualified for the World Cup finals.\nMatch schedule.\nThe match schedule, including the venue for the final, was revealed on February 4, 2024, 3:00 p.m. EST, from the Telemundo Center in Miami. However, only the venues and dates were confirmed for the matches, with no information regarding group assignments. Match pairings and kick-off times will be confirmed following the final draw, allowing for more matches to be scheduled at favorable times for global audiences. The geographical regions were updated with Atlanta and Miami moved to the eastern region. The opening match was announced to include Mexico, taking place on June 11, 2026, at the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City. The opening match involving Canada will take place on June 12 at BMO Field in Toronto, while the opening game for the U.S. will take place on the same day at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood. Each host nation was scheduled to play its three matches in the group stage within its own country. AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, will host the most matches of any venue at the tournament with nine. MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, will host the final on July 19. The United States will host 78 matches, including the quarter-finals onward, while Canada and Mexico will each host 13.\nHost cities were geographically grouped to optimize travel for teams and fans, except Canada and its opening-game opponent in Toronto. 4 out of 12 groups were allocated for the Central region with 24 matches, three groups in the Western region, and the rest in the Eastern region with a shared-region group with Canada. Cities were split into three regions: the Western Region (Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles), the Central Region (Guadalajara, Mexico City, Monterrey, Houston, Dallas, Kansas City), and the Eastern Region (Atlanta, Miami, Toronto, Boston, Philadelphia, New York/New Jersey).\nGroup stage.\nPrior to the final draw, stadiums will be assigned to specific groups. Following the final draw, pairings will be allocated to specific matches, and the kick-off times will be confirmed.\nMarketing.\nBranding.\nThe official emblem and brand identity was unveiled on May 17, 2023, at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, California; its basic form consists of a stacked \"26\" with an image of the FIFA World Cup Trophy in front of it (marking the first time that the trophy has been depicted in a World Cup emblem as a photo, as opposed to a stylized representation), but it is designed to be adaptable to different backdrops. The next day, FIFA unveiled variants of the emblem for each of the host cities, which feature color variants and designs that reflect local landscapes or culture (with the Los Angeles emblem featuring a stylized sun and wave, the Monterrey emblem featuring imagery of the Cerro de la Silla mountain, and Toronto featuring the city skyline and CN Tower).\nReaction to the logo from the initial unveiling was largely negative, with many feeling that the design was either unfinished or uncreative compared to the emblems of past FIFA World Cup tournaments. By contrast, United States national team player Jesús Ferreira described the emblem as \"beautiful\".\nBroadcasting rights.\nOn February 12, 2015, FIFA renewed the U.S. and Canadian broadcasting rights contracts for Fox, Telemundo, and CTV/TSN parent company Bell Media to cover 2026, without accepting any other bids. A report in \"The New York Times\" asserted that this extension was intended as compensation for the rescheduling of the 2022 World Cup to November–December rather than its traditional June–July scheduling, as it created considerable conflicts with major professional sports leagues that are normally in their off-season during the World Cup."

        "title": "Wheelchair basketball classification",
        "text": "Wheelchair basketball classification is the system that allows for even levels of competition on the court for wheelchair basketball based on functional mobility. The classifications for the sport are 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player, 4 point player and 4.5 point player, the greater the player's functional ability. Classification for the sport is set by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation.\nDefinition.\nClassification in wheelchair basketball plays an important role in the sport as the classification uses total points of players to determine who can be on the court. The classifications for the sport are 1 point player, 2 point player, 3 point player, 4 point player and 4.5 point player. The higher the point number, the greater the player's functional ability. With five players on the court, the total number of points may not exceed fourteen. There has been sustained criticism of the classification system as being overly complex from players, coaches and leagues. These criticisms have been documented in academic research published in 1986, 1990, 1995 and 1997.\nGovernance.\nClassification for the sport is set by the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation (IWBF). Going into the 2012 Summer Paralympics, the classification system dates to 2004 and was created by the IWBF Player Classification Commission. In 1999, the United States based National Wheelchair Basketball Association governed over their own wheelchair basketball classification system because they did not like the system used by the IWBF, finding it to complex. The system they use and oversea is based on a classification assigning players a maximum of three points. Historically, the IWBF has had a good and close relationship with the Federation Internationale de Basketball Association. At the same time, IWBF have striven to maintain independent governance of their support.\nEligibility.\n, people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. To be eligible to play wheelchair basketball, competitors must have a physical limitation that prevents them from being able to \"run, pivot, or jump at speed and with control, safety. stability, and endurance of a nondisabled player; and have a permanent physical disability in the lower limb that can be objectively verified by acknowledged medical or paramedical investigations such as measurement, X-ray, CT, MRI, and so on.\" Lower leg amputation competitors are allowed to participate in wheelchair sport following classification rules for them based on functional mobility.\nHistory.\nEarly classification for the sport was managed by ISMGF and was a medical classification system with three classes. The original wheelchair basketball classification system in 1966 had 5 classes: A, B, C, D, S. Each class was worth so many points. A was worth 1, B and C were worth 2. D and S were worth 3 points. A team could have a maximum of 12 points on the floor. This system was the one in place for the 1968 Summer Paralympics. Class A was for T1-T9 complete. Class B was for T1-T9 incomplete. Class C was for T10-L2 complete. Class D was for T10-L2 incomplete. Class S was for Cauda equina paralysis. During the 1970s, a debate began to take place in the physical disability sport community about the merits of a medical versus functional classification system. During this period, people had strong feelings both ways but few practical changes were made to existing classification systems.\nFrom 1969 to 1973, a classification system designed by Australian Dr. Bedwell was used. This system used some muscle testing to determine which class incomplete paraplegics should be classified in. It used a point system based on the ISMGF classification system. Class IA, IB and IC were worth 1 point. Class II for people with lesions between T1-T5 and no balance were also worth 1 point. Class III for people with lesions at T6-T10 and have fair balance were worth 1 point. Class IV was for people with lesions at T11-L3 and good trunk muscles. They were worth 2 points. Class V was for people with lesions at L4 to L5 with good leg muscles. Class IV was for people with lesions at S1-S4 with good leg muscles. Class V and IV were worth 3 points. The Daniels/Worthington muscle test was used to determine who was in class V and who was class IV. Paraplegics with 61 to 80 points on this scale were not eligible. A team could have a maximum of 11 points on the floor.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, ISMGF classification cheating occurred in both swimming and wheelchair basketball. Some of the medical classifications for both many sportspeople appeared arbitrary, with people of different functional levels being put into the same class. This made the results for many games and swimming races appear to be completely arbitrary. Impacted sportspeople were starting to demand that changes be made to address this. The German men and women's national wheelchair basketball teams were leading the charge in this regard, offering to test out and actually testing new systems that were being developed by Cologne based Horst Strokhkendl. This process started in 1974 with a final report being written in 1978. Despite the report being submitted to ISMGF, no changes were made for years.\nWheelchair basketball was the first disability sport to use a functional classification system instead of a medical classification system. Early experiments with this type of classification system in basketball began during the 1980s. In 1982, wheelchair basketball finally made the move to a functional classification system internationally. While the traditional medical system of where a spinal cord injury was located could be part of classification, it was only one advisory component. The first demonstration of the system used at the 1983 Gold Cup Championships. At the time, there were four classes for the sport. The competition demonstrated that ISMGF medical classifiers had issues with correctly placing players into classes that best represented their ability. The new system increased player confidence and reduced criticism of the classification system as it pertained to accusations that players had been incorrectly classified. The functional classification system used at the 1983 Gold Cup Championships was developed in Cologne based Horst Strokhkendl. This system is the one that has been used consistently in the international community since then. It was subsequently used at the 1984 World Games for the Disabled in England. The introduction of a functional classification system also meant that for the first time, amputee players could participate in the sport. Despite the system being in place in time for the 1984 and 1988 Summer Paralympics, a decision was made to delay its use at the Paralympic Games until 1992, where it was used for the first time. This was in part a result of conflict between broader ISMGF and the Wheelchair Basketball Subcommittee. The ISMGF was opposed in some measure to fully moving to a functional classification system for the sport. This conflict would not officially resolve itself until 1986, when the United States men and women threatened to boycott major tournaments unless the functional system was fully implemented.\nIn 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport and oversaw the classification systems as part of a review for any sport seeking IPC recognition. The debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme. The Games were the first ones where basketball players of different types of disabilities competed against each other, basketball players had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification.\nBecause of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, with standards based around identifying impaired strength, limb deficiency, leg length differences, and stature. It also included ways to assess vision impairment and intellectual impairment.\nSports.\nAt times, players may not easily fit into the standard full point classifications. For this reason, they can be classified in between, such as 1.5 points, 2.5 points, and 3.5 points. Classifiers are discouraged from assigning this half point classification as a competitor's initial classification. Performance wise, 4 point players can move their wheelchairs at a significantly faster speed than 1 point players. There is also a significant difference in special endurance between 2 point players, and 3 and 4 point players, with 2 point players having less special endurance. In standard endurance, there is little significant difference between the different point classifications. Across all point classes, there is little difference in ability to perform an envelope agility test. In games, 4 point players steal the ball three times more often than 1 point players. 4 point players generally have the greatest number of rebounds on the court because of competitive advantage when under the basket in terms of height, stability and strength. 4 point players turn over the ball with much greater frequency than 1 point players. 1 point and 2 point players handle the ball the least on court.\nWith a maximum of 14 points allowed to be on the floor at any time, teams may differ their point allocation based on the situation of the game. Having three 4 point players and two 1 point players involves the lower tiered players fulfilling the role of setting screens, while the higher tiered players create shots to bring the team back in the game. On the other hand, a team may choose to allocate their points in a more balanced manner to allow for increased mobility and handling.\nProcess.\nClassification appeals are handled by the IWBF. During the classification process, a player is asked to propose what classification they think they should be classified as. Once classified, changes in classification can only be made if there is unanimous decision amongst those who did the classification.\nIn most countries, classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nParalympic Games.\nOnly wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, wheelchair, amputee and cerebral palsy disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through an independent classification body, with classification being done based on functional ability. General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village in block 2 from 29 to 31 August. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 23 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 7 class changes. There were 5 protests by PPS with all 5 classifications being upheld. There were 4 classification appeals lodged for wheelchair basketball at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving 2 athletes which resulted in 2 class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, wheelchair basketball classification was scheduled for 4 to 6 September at Carioca Arena 1.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

        "title": "Para-swimming classification",
        "text": "Para-swimming classification is a function-based classification system designed to allow for fair competition in disability swimming. The classes are prefixed with \"S\" for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, \"SB\" for breaststroke and \"SM\" for individual medley events. Swimmers with physical disabilities are divided into ten classes based on their degree of functional disability: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 and S10. The lower number indicates a greater degree of impairment. Those with visual impairments are placed in three additional classes: S11, S12 and S13. One more class, S14, is reserved for swimmers with intellectual impairment. A final class, S15, is for athletes with hearing loss. Another Classification is S19 Whitch is basically S14. It is different because S14 swimmers have an Iq of below 75 whereas S19 swimmers have an Iq of above 75. \nSwimming was one of the first organised sports for people with disabilities, and was contested at the first Summer Paralympics in 1960. Both the rules for the sport and approval of classifications were the responsibility of the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA) until 1992, when the International Paralympic Committee took over the governance of classification. As of 2012, people with visual, physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in the sport. The classification system was originally based on medical criteria, but has since moved to one largely based on functional disability to make para-swimming more competitive. The sport is moving towards an evidence-based classification system.\nDefinition.\nPara-swimming classification is based on a system in which functional criteria are assessed. Athletes who have different physical disabilities may compete in the same class so long as their functional impairments are similar. In swimming, amputations of the arms below the elbow have a significant impact on functional ability. As a result, swimming classifications differ from athletics classifications. Swimmers are divided into ten classes based on degree of functional disability: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9 and S10. The most severely affected are in class S1; these swimmers normally use wheelchairs outside of the pool. Classes are prefixed with the letter \"S\" for freestyle, butterfly and backstroke events, while those prefixed with \"SB\" are for breaststroke, and those with \"SM\" for individual medley events. This is because different strokes require the use of different muscle groups. In the case of the breaststroke, for example, the hand and the hip play a crucial role. Because of this, a swimmer may compete in one class for one stroke and a different class for another. It also means that swimmers with cerebral palsy, spinal cord injuries and limb deficiencies may compete against each other. For the individual medley, the class assigned is the mean average of the classes assigned for each individual stroke (rounded to the nearest whole number with .5 rounding up).\nThere are three additional classes, S11, S12 and S13, for visually impaired swimmers. The lower number indicates a greater degree of impairment: class S11 swimmers are blind or nearly blind, and compete in blacked-out goggles. They each have a \"tapper\" who uses a pole or \"bonker\" to warn the swimmer that they are approaching the end of the pool. The visual classifications are based on medical classification, and not on functional mobility. One more class, S14, is for intellectually disabled swimmers. This class was not contested at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Paralympics after the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) dropped all intellectual disability events following the basketball ID controversy at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, but was restored for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.\nThe general rules for Paralympic swimming are based on those intended for able-bodied competitors. The rules regarding strokes, turns and the length of time that swimmers may remain under water are similar to those for the Olympic Games. Events take place in a standard 50m pool. Swimmers may dive in or start in the water. Swimmers may not use any assistive technology while competing.\nA final class, S15, is for athletes with hearing loss.\nGovernance.\nSwimming was one of the eight sports contested in the first Paralympics, the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome. Both the rules for the sport and for the approval of swimmers' classifications were set by the Fédération International de Natation Amateur (FINA). In 1992, the IPC formally became the governing body for disability swimming. Four different sporting bodies, the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), International Sports Federation of the Disabled (ISOD), International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (ISMWSF) and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), assisted the IPC in governing swimming at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC Classification Code and IPC Swimming govern the classification process. Classification of swimmers is performed by classifiers that are recognised by the IPC.\nHistory.\nThe earliest classification system for para-swimming was created during the 1940s. At this time, swimmers were classified based on their medical conditions. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, the classification system was set up as a series of \"handicaps\". In an effort to clearly describe disabilities and promote fairness, the number of classifications ballooned. This made organizing competitive events difficult as there were too few people in each classification; international events for people with disabilities were said to have as many winners as competitors. At the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul, the number of eligible classes was so great that 60 gold medals were awarded in one swimming event.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, classification involved being examined in a supine position on an examination table, where multiple medical classifiers would often stand around the player, poke and prod their muscles with their hands and with pins. The system had no built-in privacy safeguards and players being classified were not ensured privacy during medical classification nor with their medical records.\nDuring the 1960s and 1970s, ISMGF classification cheating occurred in both swimming and wheelchair basketball. Some of the medical classifications appeared arbitrary, with people of different functional levels being put into the same class. This made the results for many games and swimming races appear to be completely arbitrary. Impacted sportspeople were starting to demand that changes be made to address this.\nIn 1974, the Disabled of the German State of North Rhine-Westphalia (BSNW) developed a swimming classification system that stayed in use until 1982. This system had seven classifications. There was a CP class for athletes with hemispasticity who would also compete in the same class against competitors who were single arm above the elbow amputees, had double-arm dysmelia type ectromelia, had single arm paralysis or had a fixed shoulder joint. There was an intellectual disability class called Class J, and a Class H for people with severe disabilities. BSNW classification events included swimming races from 50 to 1500 metres. The system was later expanded to include nine classes before it was discontinued. The BSNW system did not gain international support, and only was used inside Germany. It was discarded because of a need to have athletes classified for international competitions.\nIn 1983, classification for swimmers with cerebral palsy was governed by CP-ISRA. There were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the 25 metre freestyle event with flotation devices with or without flotation devices. Class 2 competitors could compete in the same events, but only against class 2 competitors. That year, 80 to 85 per cent of all competitors with cerebral palsy competed in the same classification in international competitions.\nClassification for swimming relied on a points system to assess the severity of physical disability without considering athlete functionality specifically as it applied to the ability to swim a particular stroke. This caused problems because certain types of disability had a greater negative impact on swimming than others, and the point system did not directly address functional ability. To address this, in 1990 point consideration was eliminated for disability types that did not impact performance. The IPC decided to reduce the number of classifications, and to try to fix classification so that competitors could have more certainty in which classification they would compete in before attending an event. This was a major change, as previously, athletes would be classified immediately before, and even during, an event. As a result, the number of swimming classifications dropped from 31 at Seoul in 1988 to 10 at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona.\nGoing into the 1992 Summer Paralympics, the International Coordinating Committee and the Technical Committee of the IPC push for a move towards a functional classification system. This came to a head at the November 1989 meeting of the Barcelona Olympics Organising Committee (\"Comite Organitzador Olimpic Barcelona\" - COOB), when a discussion started about what events and classifications should be eligible for the Games. A study by the organising committee and the Polytechnic University of Catalonia in the lead-up to the meeting looked at the results of recent international competitions. It proposed a series of classes, based on the competitive results, for use in Barcelona. COOB insisted that such a system be implemented to ensure the sport at the Paralympic Games was serious and competitive, instead of recreational. The suggestions were implemented for sports such as swimming and athletics. The Games were the first ones where swimmers of different types of disabilities competed against each other, swimmers had a guaranteed right to appeal their classification.\nThe move to functional classification coincided with the rise of sports science. The first detailed international swimming sport science project was conducted at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. This was followed by a similar project at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona. These studies provided an increasingly detailed understanding of the factors involved in high performance swimming. Henceforth sports science became the driver of both performance and classification.\nAhead of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney, changes were made in classification for the breaststroke, bringing the total number of functional classifications down from ten that had competed in Atlanta to nine. Swimmers who had been classified as SB10 at the 1996 Summer Paralympics in Atlanta opted not to compete in Sydney. Several former SB8 and SB9 swimmers moved down a class to compete, and made the finals in their classifications. The IPC's Olympian aspiration to become an premier elite international sporting competition still fell short. In Sydney, 561 gold medals were awarded in 18 sports, compared with 300 in 28 sports at the 2000 Summer Olympics.\nClassification process.\nDuring the classification process, classifiers evaluate factors including whether a swimmer's physical limitations require him or her to start in the water, and how the swimmer enters the water in competition. A two-person panel that includes at least one person with a medical background handles classification at international competitions. Classifiers are required to be familiar with the type of disability they are classifying, whether physical, visual or intellectual. \nClassification by national sports bodies mirrors the international classification process, conducted by nationally recognised IPC classifiers. For Australian competitors, for example, classification is managed by the national sport federation, Swimming Australia, with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: provisional, national and international. The first is for club-level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nInternationally, all classification is handled in English but athletes are allowed to have an interpreter present during the process. Swimmers are required to disclose any medications they regularly use, and provide detailed records of their medical history if a classifier deems them relevant. They are allowed to have someone familiar with their swimming limitations present during the process. The process includes a physical assessment, observation assessment, and a functional assessment that may include performance in the pool. Swimmers with visual impairment do not require the functional and observational components of assessment. If a swimmer intentionally misrepresents his or her disability, he or she is barred from the classification process for a minimum of two years, and is unable to compete.\nIf swimmers do not agree with their classifications, they can appeal through the IPC Board of Appeal on Classification, which is the body recognised by IPC Swimming. Formal processes exist for how to do this in both non-competition and competition periods. Classification assessment took roughly 30 to 45 minutes at the 1996 Summer Paralympics. Classification for blind swimmers only lasted about 15 minutes.\nClassification at the Paralympics.\nAll disability types were eligible to participate at the 1992 Summer Paralympics. The IPC oversaw classification based on functional disability. General and functional classification took place in the Paralympic Village, with functional swimming classification taking place on the same dates at the Piscines Bernat Picronell. The process became a contentious issue at the Paralympics because of on-the-spot reclassifications that resulted in changes to the competition schedule. On-the-spot classification or re-classification was viewed as a negative aspect of the 1996 Summer Paralympics, and the Paralympic movement overall. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 54 assessments were conducted, resulting in 13 class changes. There was one Paralympic New Status (PNS) protest and two Paralympic Permanent Status (PPS) protests by a national Paralympic committee, with one classification upheld and two denied. Six classification appeals were lodged for swimming at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving four athletes, resulting in two class changes. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, the IPC had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, swimming classification was scheduled to take place at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium, with visually impaired swimmers getting classified from September 4 to 6 and all other swimmers being classified from September 3 to 5. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio de Janeiro, their in-competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.\nFuture.\nDisability sport's major classification body, the IPC, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system, as opposed to a performance-based system, so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class compared to competitors who train less."

        "title": "Para-cycling classification",
        "text": "Para-cycling classification is the process of classifying participants in para-cycling covering four functional disability types. The classification system includes classes for handcycles for people who have lower limb mobility issues. The sport is governed by the (UCI).\nDefinition.\nThere are fourteen classifications based on functional disability type. \nThe blind classifications are based on medical classification, not functional mobility classification.\nBeyond the level of vision impairment, research done at the Central Institute on Employment Abilities of the Handicapped in Moscow has found differences in functional capabilities based on differences in visual acuity. This does not play a significant role in tandem cycling.\nGovernance.\nClassification is handled by the (UCI). While the CP-ISRA has an interest in the sport because it is open to people with cerebral palsy, it is not governed by them. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the UCI coordinated Federation Internationale de Amateur de Cyclisme.\nEligibility.\n, people with physical and visual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. In 1983, Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain lesion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres.\nHistory.\nIn 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association. The classification used the classification system designed for track events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. By the early 1990s, cycling classification had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nThe debate about inclusion of competitors into able-bodied competitions was seen by some disability sport advocates like Horst Strokhkendl as a hindrance to the development of an independent classification system not based on the rules for able-bodied sport. These efforts ended by 1993 as the International Paralympic Committee tried to carve out its own identity and largely ceased efforts for inclusion of disability sport on the Olympic programme.\nClasses.\nClassification for para-cycling is done for four types of cycling equipment — (1) upright bicycles, (2) handcycles, (3) tricycles, and (4) tandem bicycles. For each type of equipment, the classifications are based on disability type or level. Classification numbers indicate the severity level of limitation, with 1 being the most severe, for example the lower numbers indicate both lower and upper limb limitations, whereas, the higher numbers apply to athletes with only lower limb limitations. \nPara-cycling classes, as defined by the UCI, can be decoded easily. The first letter stands for the gender (M for men, W for women). Subsequent letters stand for the sport division (C for Cycling; H for Handbike, T for Tricycle, B for blind or visually impaired - also known as TCB for Tandem Class Blind). The final number is the class in that division - with the lower the number, the greater the degree of impairment. Therefore WH3 stands for the class \"Women's Handbike 3\".\nThe International Paralympic Committee lists eligible impairment types as:\nCycling.\nAthletes have a physical impairment that prevents them from competing in able-bodied competition but still compete using a \"standard bicycle\". There are five classes of cycling: \nHandbike or hand cycling.\nAthletes have lower limb impairment that necessitates use of a hand-operated cycle. There are five classes of hand cycling: \nIn hand-cycling classifications, H1 and H2 can use an AP1 and AP2 handcycle, H3 can use an AP2, AP3 and ATP2 handcycle, and H4 can use an ATP3 handcycle.\nTricycle.\nAthletes have an impairment which affects their balance. They compete with a three-wheeled cycle called a tricycle - three wheels providing more balance than a standard two-wheeled cycle.\nBlind/Visually Impaired, also known as Tandem Class Blind.\nAthletes who are blind or visually impaired. They compete using a two-person cycle known as a tandem, with a sighted \"pilot\" in the front seat. Under UCI rules, a professional cyclist must not be active for 12 months in any UCI professional tour (starting January 1 of the year) or be selected to any national team in a UCI-sanctioned championship, except Masters (over 40), in order to apply as a para-cycling pilot.\nThis rule is designed to prevent active elite-level cyclists from having an advantage, although developmental cyclists who have yet to participate in a UCI professional tour or retired elite cyclists could participate. For example, Corentin Ermenault, a young French cyclist who has yet to reach the professional ranks, and Adam Duggleby, who is not a professional on the major tours, both served as sighted guides at the 2020 Paralympics. Craig MacLean, who medaled at the Olympic Games in 2000, retired in 2008 and began serving as a guide in 2011 after sitting out the required two years.\nProcess.\nInternational classification is undertaken by a UCI panel which consists of \"a medical doctor, a physiotherapist and a sports technician\" who will assess the athlete and assign them a class. The evaluation is done in English, and athletes are allowed to be accompanied by an interpreter and/or a representative of their country's National Federation in the sport. Classified athletes will be issued a para-cycling classification card.\nFor Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: \nAt the Paralympic Games.\nCompetitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. Cycling appeared for the first time at the 1988 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, cerebral palsy, amputee and wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through multiple federations and the International Paralympic Committee, with classification being done based on disability type. At the 1996 Summer Paralympics, on the spot classification required that classifiers have access to medical equipment like Snellen charts, reflex hammers, and goniometers to properly classify competitors. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 33 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 5 class changes. Handcycling classifications were included at the Paralympics for the first time at the 2004 Summer Paralympics.\nA total of 155 men and 70 women competed at the London 2012 Summer Paralympics. Road cycling competition was held at Brands Hatch, Kent from 5 September to 8 September, while track cycling was held at the Velodrome, Olympic Park from 30 August to 2 September. A maximum of 14 men and 7 women per nation were allowed to compete across the 18 medal events in road cycling and 32 medal events in track cycling.\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, cycling classification was scheduled for September 5 at the Velodrome and September 4 to September 6 for visually impaired cyclists. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.[33]\nFuture.\n, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

        "title": "Para-snowboarding classification",
        "text": "Para-snowboarding classification is the classification system for para-snowboarding. The sport originally called Adaptive Snowboard is now practiced by hundreds of athletes around the world. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) defines three classes: SB-LL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both legs (with SB-LL1 and SB-LL2 for more- and less-severe impairment), and SB-UL for athletes with a physical impairment affecting one or both arms who compete standing. The sport made its official Winter Paralympic debut in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia.\nEligibility.\nClassifications exist for deaf competitors, blind competitors, people with physical disabilities and those with intellectual disabilities. The IPC eligibility rules provide for athletes with a physical impairment such as limb loss or limb deficiency, spinal cord injury, nerve damage, or cerebral palsy. , athletes with other impairments, such as visual impairments, are not eligible. The IPC defined two competition classes in 2014:\nFor the 2018 Winter Paralympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, the IPC divided the SB-LL category in twain:\nThe World Snowboard Federation (WSF) has a more elaborate classification system, with classes SB1 to SB12 for snowboarders with limb disabilities:\nThe WSF also defines three visual impairment class, B1, B2 and B3, identical to those used by the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) for other sports for visually impaired athletes.\nGovernance.\nThe sport widely called Adaptive Snowboarding held its first official competition at the 2000 USASA Nationals in Waterville Valley NH, USA. The USASA governed adaptive snowboarding competitions in North America through 2008, after which the World Snowboard Federation accepted international governance beginning in 2009. It is now practiced by hundreds of athletes around the world, and governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The IPC and the WSF signed a memorandum of understanding in July 2009 under which the WSF would continue to govern the sport until 2014, after which the situation would be reassessed. Both organisations would continue their efforts to develop the sport. IPC Alpine Skiing governs snowboarding as well as alpine skiing, and the two share a common set of regulations. In explaining the change of the name of the sport, the WSF stated that:\nFor Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nAfter initially rejecting the sport in August 2011, the International Paralympic Committee changed its mind and added Para-snowboarding to the Alpine Skiing programme on 2 May 2012. The President of the Sochi 2014 Olympic Organizing Committee, Dmitry Chernyshenko, welcomed the addition of the new sport, saying:\nThe sport made its official Winter Paralympic debut in the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi, Russia. There were men's and women's standing snowboard cross. Only events in the SB-LL class were offered. The events were run in a time-trial format (one rider on course at a time), and. unlike some other Paralympic events, results were calculated \"without\" factors that adjust times based on disability classification. Each athlete got three runs over a course of jumps, bumps and turns. Times from the best two were added together for their final total.\nBoth events were run on 14 March 2014. The women's event was won by Bibian Mentel-Spee from the Netherlands in a time of 1 minute 57.43 seconds. France's Cecile Hernandez Ep Cervellon came second with a time of 2 minutes 07.31 seconds. America's Amy Purdy came third in 2 minutes 14.29 seconds. The men's event was a clean sweep for the United States. Evan Strong won in 1 minute 43.61 seconds, followed by Michael Shea with a time of 1:44.18 and Keith Gabel with a time of 1:47.10.\nFuture.\nThe snowboarding cross events at Sochi were a success, with tickets for para-snowboarding events being among the first to sell out. In April 2014 the IPC announced plans to add slalom to the events at 2018 Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Consideration was also given to having the snowboard cross event run with pairs of athletes competing against each other rather than as a time trial. There were still no plans to add non-standing or visually impaired events. , visually impaired events were not considered for medal events at WSF Para-Snowboard competitions due to the small numbers of internationally competitive athletes."

        "text": "Para-archery classification is the classification system for para-archery used to create a level playing field for archers with a different range of disabilities. Governance in the sport is through the International Archery Federation. Early classification systems for the sport were created during the 1940s and based on medical classification. This has subsequently changed to a functional mobility classification with the exception of blind archery.\nDefinition and participation.\nPara-archery classification at the Paralympic Games is the basis for determining who can compete in the sport, and within which class. It is used for the purposes of establishing fair competition. Entry is eligible to male and female athletes with a physical disability. The blind classifications are based on medical classification, no functional classification.\nPeople with cerebral palsy are eligible to compete in archery. The Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) classes of CP3, CP4, CP5, CP6, CP7 and CP8 have counterparts with the classification system used by the World Archery Federation.\nGovernance.\nGovernance in the sport is through the International Archery Federation (also known as the World Archery Federation or Fédération International de Tir à l’Arc – FITA) and is overseen by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The IPC transferred its governance to FITA in 2009 as part of the IPC's program to move governance to sport-specific bodies. FITA sets the rules for competition in the World Archery Book: the most recent version effective as of 1 April 2012. In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the Federation Internationale de Tir Al'Arc.\nHistory.\nThe classification for this sport was created during the 1940s and for much of its early history was a medical condition based classification system. In 1964, the International Sport Organization for the Disabled (ISOD) was created. They created the first formal classification system, which had 27. This was reduced to 12 classifications for the 1976 Summer Paralympics and was further reduced to nine classifications for the 1992 Summer Paralympics. In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was undertaken by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). The classification was based upon the system designed for field athletics events. There were five cerebral palsy classifications for its competitors. Class 1 and Class 2 competitors could compete in the division 1, class 1 and class 2 events. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain lesion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres. By the early 1990s, the archery classification had moved away from medical based ones to a functional classification system. Going into the 2000 Summer Paralympics, there were concerns raised by members of the cerebral palsy community about the need to maintain a multiple functional classification system inside this sport specifically for this class of athletes given the large range of functional ability inside the community with cerebral palsy and other motor functional disabilities. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nEligibility.\n, people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. Male and female athletes with a physical disability (as defined by the IPC) can compete in the following divisions: recurve (or classic) bow, compound bow and visually impaired (VI). Within these divisions are open, standing and wheelchair classes with events for individuals and teams.&lt;ref name=\"Archery: Events/Disciplines\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nThe distance from the target and number of arrows shot is the same for para-archery athletes as for able-bodied competitors except for the Visually Impaired (VI) division. Athletes must have a current disability classification card or their results will not qualify for World Records, titles or any other rankings.\nClasses.\nThere are three divisions in Para-Archery: Recurve Bow, Compound Bow and Visually Impaired. Within these divisions, athletes are classified by their impairment(s) as follows:\nAssistive devices must be authorized by an international classifier and listed on the athlete's classification card. Assistive devices can include:\nVisually impaired athletes in the VI division must wear a blindfold for vision impairment equality.\nProcess.\nFor a para-archery athlete to compete at the Paralympic Games, international classification by an International Classification Panel is required. The International Classification Panel will allocate a class to the athlete and rule which (if any) assistive equipment the athlete may use. Their ruling overrides all prior classifications including those of a national basis. Athletes must be classified according to their disability and level of impairment. The classification process normally involves a physical assessment to authenticate the disability and evaluate the degree of limitation. The athlete will be observed in competition action. Results will place the athlete in one of the three classes (see Classes): this evaluation cannot be used for sports outside of Archery.\nWhilst athletes may be deemed to have a disability or impairment, this does not guarantee classification. Athletes may be deemed ineligible to compete based on any of the following findings:\nAthletes may need to undergo the classification process more than once if their impairment is of a progressive nature. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport is not supported by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nOnly wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. This continued at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo and 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, amputee and wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the IPC, with classification including standing, sitting and open. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 10 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 0 class changes. 88 male and 52 female para-archery athletes from across the world will compete at the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games. Competition is being held at The Royal Artillery Barracks from the 30 August to 5 September, with nine medal events in standing and seated classes held. A maximum of three athletes per country will compete in individual events. For each team event, a maximum of one team with three athletes per country is allowed.\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case by case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, archery classification was scheduled for 7 September and 8 September at Sambodromo. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.\nProminent athletes.\nSome prominent para-archery athletes have competed and won medals in both able-bodied and paralympic competition. The first paraplegic athlete to compete in able-bodied competition the Olympic Games was a para-archer named Neroli Fairhall of New Zealand.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

        "text": "Wheelchair rugby classification is the seven class system that assigns players a point value based on functional mobility to insure parity in athletic ability on the court at any given time. Classification is handled by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation.\nDefinition.\nIn wheelchair rugby, players are assessed into seven classes: 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 points. The lower level points indicate less functional ability and the higher points indicate greater functional ability. Men and women both play the sport, and they play on the same team. There are no separate events for men and women.\nOnly four players are on the court at any given time. The total points on the floor for a team cannot exceed 8, but this maximum is increased by 0.5 points for every female on the court. This is done in order to insure parity in athletic ability on the court at any given time. \nGovernance.\nClassification is handled by the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation, and is outlined in their 2008 publication called \"International Wheelchair Rugby Federation Classification Manual.\" In 2009, the classification was handled by the IWAS.\nEligibility.\n, people with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. Lower leg amputation competitors are allowed to participate in wheelchair sport following classification rules for them based on functional mobility.\nHistory.\nThe sport was created in 1977 in Canada, and was designed as an alternative to wheelchair basketball. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport. Wheelchair rugby had been governed by IWAS since 1992, close to the sport's inception. IWAS had also managed the classification side of the sport. In 2010, the International Wheelchair Rugby Federation formally separated from IWAS and took over management of classification of their sport themselves.\nProcess.\nWheelchair rugby classification includes looking at practiced activities, and may include observing their warm up routine, the ability during throwing drills, their ability to catch a ball and their ability to maneuver their wheelchair. Classification may also include a test where competitors are asked to bench press in order to demonstrate their upper arm strength and how much upper arm mobility they possess.\nIn most countries, classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nAt the 1992 Summer Paralympics, wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through ISMWSF, with classification being done based on functional disability type. There were 4 classification appeals lodged for wheelchair rugby at the 2000 Summer Paralympics involving 3 athletes which resulted in 1 class change.\nWheelchair rugby competition at the London 2012 Summer Paralympics was held at the Basketball Arena, Olympic Park from the 5 September to 9 September. One team of twelve athletes (men and women) per country was allowed.\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. Wheelchair rugby competitors were an exception to this rule in that players under Review status for their classification would be eligible to compete in Rio. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, wheelchair rugby classification was scheduled for September 11 to 12 at Athletes Park. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

Competition at the 2012 Summer Paralympics will be held at Eton Manor (Olympic Park), from 1 September to 8 September. It is estimated that between 64 and 80 men and 32 to 48 women will compete in six medal events. The maximum number of competitors per country allowed is as follows:\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\nProminent athletes.\nDavid Hall is Australia's highest medal winner at the Paralympics in wheelchair tenniswith one gold, three silver and two bronze medals spanning across three Paralympic Games.\nIn the Paralympics Esther Vergeer won four gold medals in singles as well as three gold and one silver medals in the doubles.\nIn the Paralympics Shingo Kunieda won three gold medals in singles as well as one gold and two bronze medals in the doubles.\nIn the Paralympics David Wagner won one gold and two bronze medals in singles as well as three gold medals in the doubles.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

        "text": "Wheelchair fencing classification is the classification system for wheelchair fencing which is governed by the IWAS. People with physical disabilities are eligible to compete included people with physical disabilities. Classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee.\nPurpose.\nIn wheelchair fencing, the purpose of classification is to insure that fencers are classified based on equitable functional mobility so that their training, skill level, talent and experience determine the outcome of a match, not their disability type. This insures fairness in the sport.\nGovernance.\nIn 2009, the classification was handled by the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS). In 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the Federation Internationale Escrime. IWAS continues to serve as the international classification body for the sport, with classification handled by a wheelchair fencing subcommittee.\nClasses and eligibility.\nThere are four classes in wheelchair fencing, with the classes having names of 1, 2, 3 and 4. These classes are often combined with the combined classes of Category A and Category B.\nClass 3 is for paraplegics from D10 to L2, scoring between 5 and 9 points on Type 1 and Type 2 function tests. For class 4, fencers tend to have a lesion below L4. They tend to score at least 5 points on Type 3 and Type 4 of the function test. For international IWF sanctioned competitions, classes are combined. 3 and 4 are combined, competing as Category A.\nLower leg amputation competitors are allowed to participate in wheelchair sport following classification rules for them based on functional mobility. , people with physical disability are eligible to compete in this sport.\nHistory.\nDuring the 1980s, there was a move away from a medical classification system to a functional one, with ISMWSF being one of the organizations driving this change on the wheelchair sport side. Some wheelchair sports saw the introduction of sport specific classification systems during this period, including wheelchair fencing, with the IWF Classification system being implemented for the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul. It had first been used at the European Championships in Glasgow 1987, and was small changes were made to this system before its use at the 1988 Games.\nBy the early 1990s, wheelchair fencing classification had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nOnly wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. This continued at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo and 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, wheelchair users were eligible to participate, with classification being run through ISMWSF, with classification being done based on functional spinal disability type. Wheelchair fencing at the 1996 Summer Paralympics saw the introduction of A and B classes, much like the ones used today. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 6 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 0 class changes. 1 classification was PPS protested by a national Paralympic committee and was denied.\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis.\nGetting classified.\nIn most countries, classification for national competitions is done through the local national Paralympic committee.\nOne of the standard means of assessing functional classification is the bench test. Using the Adapted Research Council (MRC) measurements, muscle strength is tested using the bench press for a variety of spinal cord related injuries with a muscle being assessed on a scale of 1 to 5 for people with cerebral. A 1 is for no functional movement of the muscle or where there is no motor coordination. A 2 is for normal muscle movement range not exceeding 25% or where the movement can only take place with great difficult and, even then, very slowly. A 3 is where normal muscle movement range does not exceed 50%. A 4 is when normal muscle movement range does not exceed 75% and or there is slight in-coordination of muscle movement. A 5 is for normal muscle movement.\nWheelchair fencing classification has 6 test for functionality during classification, along with a bench test. Each test gives 0 to 3 points. A 0 is for no function. A 1 is for minimum movement. A 2 is for fair movement but weak execution. A 3 is for normal execution. The first test is an extension of the dorsal musculature. The second test is for lateral balance of the upper limbs. The third test measures trunk extension of the lumbar muscles. The fourth test measures lateral balance while holding a weapon. The fifth test measures the trunk movement in a position between that recorded in tests one and three, and tests two and four. The sixth test measures the trunk extension involving the lumbar and dorsal muscles while leaning forward at a 45 degree angle. In addition, a bench test is required to be performed."

        "text": "Disability table tennis classification is the disability sport classification process for para table tennis that is governed by the International Table Tennis Federation. The sport's classifications are open to people with physical and intellectual disabilities.\nGovernance.\nIn 1983, the rules for this sport and approval for classification was done by the International Table Tennis Federation. This remained the case in 2009.\nEligibility.\n, people with physical and intellectual disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. In 1983, Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA) set the eligibility rules for classification for this sport. They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres.\nHistory.\nIn 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association. The classification used the classification system designed for field athletics events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. Going into the 2000 Summer Paralympics, there were concerns raised by members of the cerebral palsy community about the need to maintain a multiple functional classification system inside this sport specifically for this class of athletes given the large range of functional ability inside the community with cerebral palsy and other motor functional disabilities. At the New York hosted Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged, this sport was played, with the organisers having hearing and vision impaired classifications, amputee classifications, Les Autres, cerebral palsy and spinal cord disabilities. By the early 1990s, table tennis classification had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level.

The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nProcess.\nIn table tennis classification, practiced activities are looked at and classifiers may look at things like how a player positions themselves relative to the table, their ability to serve and to return a serve. For Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nOnly wheelchair classified athletes were eligible to compete at the 1960 Summer Paralympics in Rome in this sport. This continued at the 1964 Summer Paralympics in Tokyo and 1968 Summer Paralympics in Tel Aviv. Competitors with cerebral palsy classifications were allowed to compete at the Paralympics for the first time at the 1984 Summer Paralympics. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, amputee and wheelchair disability types were eligible to participate, with classification being run through the International Paralympic Committee, with classification being done based on functional disability type.

        "title": "Para-equestrian classification",
        "text": "Para-equestrian classification is a system for para-equestrian sport is a graded system based on the degree of physical or visual disability and handled at the international level by the FEI. The sport has eligible classifications for people with physical and vision disabilities. Groups of eligible riders include The sport is open to competitors with impaired muscle power, athetosis, impaired passive range of movement, hypertonia, limb deficiency, ataxia, leg length difference, short stature, and vision impairment. They are grouped into five different classes to allow fair competition. These classes are Grade I, Grade II, Grade III, Grade IV, and Grade V(Grade Names Changed as of Jan 2017) . The para-equestrian classification does not consider the gender of the rider, as equestrines compete in mixed gender competitions.\nHistory of classification.\nIn 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors in this sport was done by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA). They defined cerebral palsy as a non-progressive brain legion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain damage were eligible for classification by them. The organisation also dealt with classification for people with similar impairments. For their classification system, people with spina bifida were not eligible unless they had medical evidence of loco-motor dysfunction. People with cerebral palsy and epilepsy were eligible provided the condition did not interfere with their ability to compete. People who had strokes were eligible for classification following medical clearance. Competitors with multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy and arthrogryposis were not eligible for classification by CP-ISRA, but were eligible for classification by International Sports Organisation for the Disabled for the Games of Les Autres.\nThe CP-ISRA used the classification system designed for field athletics events. In 1983, there were five cerebral palsy classifications. Class 1 competitors could compete in the Division 1, Class 1 and Class 2 events, while riding with a leader and 2 siderwalkers and/or a backwalker. In 1990, the Equestrian Australia did not have specific classifications for competitors with disabilities. Acknowledging membership needs though, some rules had organically developed that looked like classifications based on rule modification for different disability types. These included acknowledging one-armed riders were not required to hold the reins in both arms, riders with hearing loss were given visual signals instead of audio signals at the start of and during an event, and blind riders, when they reached a marker, were given an auditory signal. When the sport was undergoing growth in 1995, a classification system was established in order to provide a level playing field for competitors. The system developed at the time was called \"Functional Profile System for Grading\" and was largely created by Christine Meaden, who had IPEC classifier status. By 1999, there were four classifications for competitors and 120 accredited equestrian classifiers around the world. At the New York hosted Empire State Games for the Physically Challenged, para-equestrian competition was broken into hearing and vision impaired classifications, amputee classifications, Les Autres, cerebral palsy and spinal cord disabilities.\nAt the 1996 Summer Paralympics, classification was done at the venue because classification assessment required watching a competitor play the sport. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 6 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations, in this case FEI, to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nThe fourth edition of FEI's classification system guide was published in January 2015.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less.\nClassification process.\nThe purpose of classification to identify the level of functional disability of a rider, completely independent of their skill level. This is because demonstration of skill is the purpose of competition. Steps are taken before and during the classification process to avoid this. Part of the process involves observing the competitor riding and doing a bench press. For this reason, classifiers do not observe a rider on their horse prior to the bench press to avoid assessing skill at functionality.\nDuring classification, classifiers look at several things including a rider's mobility, strength and coordination. This is done during a bench press, during training and in competition. After riders are classified, they are giving both a classification and a profile. This profile a number 1 to 39 for para-dressage and 1 to 32 for para-driving. This profile impacts what adaptive equipment riders can use.\nEach rider's classification has a status. The available statuses for classification include New, Review, Reviewed Fixe Date - Paralympic Games, and Confirmed. The status of a rider's classification affects their ability to protest their classification.\nClassification governance.\nInternationally, classification is handled by FEI. Classification at the national level is handled by different organizations. For example, Australian para-equestrian sport and classification is managed by the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nCriticism.\nThe classification system in para-equestrian has been criticized by some riders as not fully taking into account disabilities that have fluctuations in a person's regular functional abilities. This criticism specifically related to multiple sclerosis.\nDiagrams.\nThe images below are examples derived from FEI's guide.\nPara-dressage classification.\nThe Grade 1 (Grade I) para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 1 incorporates severely disabled riders with Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres and Spinal Cord Injury.\" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 1: Severely disabled riders with cerebral palsy, les autres and spinal cord injury\" In 2011, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) defined this classification as: \"Riders compete in four mixed disability groups or ‘grades’, with Grade 1 split into two sub-categories (1a and 1b).\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE I: These riders are mainly wheelchair users who have poor trunk balance and/or impaired function in all four limbs or good upper limb control but no trunk balance.\"\nThe FEI defines this classification as \"Grade I — This is split again into two sections: Grade Ib — At this level the rider will ride walk with some trot work excluding medium trot. Grade Ia — At this level the rider will ride a walk only test.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade I: Athletes with a physical disability. Riders with poor trunk balance and/or impairment of function in all four limbs or no trunk balance and good upper limb function. Riders generally use a wheelchair in everyday life. Grade 1 is split into 1a and 1b.\"\nEquipment usage for this class differs based on rider profile. In general, competitors in this grade use a snaffle bit. Riders may use their voice to guide the horse during competition provided they do so in moderation. Riders from this classification may compete at a higher functionality class, but they must declare their intention to do so by end of the year for competitions in the following year.\nGrade 1.\nAs of July 2016, the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 1a on their website as \"Athletes in grade 1a have severe impairments affecting all limbs and the trunk. The athlete usually requires the use of a wheelchair in daily life.\"\nGrade 1a para-dressage riders with Profiles 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 12a, and 13 are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 1a para-dressage riders with Profiles 7, 12a, and 13 are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\nFor Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 1a classification, the percentage was 71.78%. Competitors in Grade 1a include Australia's Rob Oakley.\nGrade 2.\nAs of Jan 2017 the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 2 on their website as \"Athletes in grade 2 have either a severe impairment of the trunk and minimal impairment of the upper limbs or moderate impairment of the trunk, upper and lower limbs. Most athletes in this class use a wheelchair in daily life.\"\nGrade 2 para-dressage riders with Profiles 4, 6, 9, 10a/b, 11a/b, 12b, and 31a/b are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 2 para-dressage riders with Profile 12b are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\nCompetitors in Grade 2 include Australia's Grace Bowman and Joann Formosa. For Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 1b classification, the percentage was 71.95% for Grade 1B.\nGrade 3.\nThe Grade 3 (Grade III) para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 3 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres, Spinal Cord injury and Amputee riders with reasonable balance and abdominal control. \" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 3: Athletes with reasonable balance and abdominal control including amputees\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE III: These riders are mainly wheelchair users or people who have severe movement impairment involving the lower half and with mild to good upper limb function, or severe impairment on one side of the body. \" Federation Equestre International defines this classification as \"At this level the rider will ride a novice level test excluding canter.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade III: Athletes with a physical disability.

Riders may use their voice to guide the horse during competition provided they do so in moderation. Riders from this classification may compete at a higher functionality class, but they must declare their intention to do so by end of the year for competitions in the following year. Grade 3 para-dressage riders with Profiles 8, 10a/b, 11a/b, 14, 17a, 18a, 27, 31a/b, and 32 are allowed to have a hard hand hold. Grade 2 para-dressage riders with Profile 14, and 27 are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\nFor Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 2 classification, the percentage was 69.7%.\nGrade 4.\nThe Grade 4 (Grade IV) Para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 4 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres, Amputee, Spinal Cord Injury and totally blind athletes with good balance, leg movement and co-ordination.\" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 4: Athletes with good balance, leg movement and coordination including blind athletes\" In 2011, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games defined this classification as: \"The visually-impaired compete alongside those with a physical disability in Grades 4 and 5 only.\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE IV: Riders in this section are mainly able to walk without support, with moderate impairment on one side of the body, moderate impairment in all four limbs or severe arm impairment. They may require a wheelchair to cover longer distances. They must have a total loss of vision in both eyes.\" Federation Equestre International defines this classification as \"At this level the rider will ride a novice level test.\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade IV: Athletes with a physical disability or vision impairment. Riders with moderate unilateral impairment, moderate impairment in four limbs or severe arm impairment. In day to day life, riders are usually ambulant but some may use a wheelchair for longer distances or due to lack of stamina. Riders with a vision impairment who compete in this class have total loss of sight in both eyes (B1).\" As of July 2016, the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 3 on their website as \"Athletes in grade III have a severe impairment or deficiency of both upper limbs or a moderate impairment of all four limbs or short stature. Athletes in grade III are able to walk and generally do not require a wheelchair in daily life. Grade III also includes athletes having a visual impairment equivalent to B1 with very low visual acuity and/ or no light perception.\"\nEquipment usage for this class differs based on rider profile. In general, competitors in this grade use a snaffle bit or double bridle. Riders may not use their voice to guide the horse during competition unless their classifier has specifically allowed for this. Grade 4 para-dressage riders with Profile 15 are allowed to use a connecting rein bar.\nRiders from this classification may compete at a higher functionality class, but they must declare their intention to do so by end of the year for competitions in the following year.\nCompetitors in this classification include Australia's Sharon Jarvis. For Australian who tried to qualify for the 2012 Summer Paralympics, they needed to have a percentage of a target score \"based on the average overall scores that achieved medals in each grade at the 2010 World Equestrian Games\". For Grade 4 classification, the percentage was 70.88%.\nGrade 5.\nGrade 5 (Grade V) Para-equestrian classification is defined by \"BBC Sport\" as follows: \"Grade 5 incorporates Cerebral Palsy, Les Autres, Amputee, Spinal Cord injury and Visually Impaired. This last group comprises ambulant athletes with either impaired vision or impaired arm/leg function. \" In 2008, \"BBC Sport\" defined this classification was \"Grade 5: Ambulant athletes (those able to walk independently) with either impaired vision or impaired arm or leg function\" In 2011, the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games defined this classification as: \"The visually-impaired compete alongside those with a physical disability in Grades 4 and 5 only.\" In 2008, the \"Australian Broadcasting Corporation\" defined this classification was \"GRADE V: These riders have impairment in one or two limbs or some degree of visual impairment.\" Federation Equestre International defines this classification as \"At this level the rider will ride an elementary/medium level test\" The Australian Paralympic Committee defined this classification as: \"Grade V: Athletes with a physical disability or vision impairment. Riders have a physical impairment in one or two limbs (for example limb loss or limb deficiency), or some degree of visual impairment (B2).\" As of July 2016, the International Paralympic Committee defines Grade 5 on their website as \"Athletes in Grade V have a mild impairment of range of movement or muscle strength or a deficiency of one limb or mild deficiency of two limbs. Grade V also includes athletes with visual impairment equivalent to B2 with a higher visual acuity than visually impaired athletes competing in the Grade IV sport class and/ or a visual field of less than 5 degrees radius.\"\nEquipment usage for this class differs based on rider profile. In general, competitors in this grade use a snaffle bit or a double bridle.

        "title": "Adaptive rowing classification",
        "text": "Adaptive rowing classification is the classification system used for adaptive rowing. It is based on functional ability and is broken down into three specific classifications. This system is governed by Federation Internationale de Societes d'Aviron. Eligible competitors have a physical or visual disability.\nDefinition.\nAdaptive rowing has three broad classifications based on a rower's functional ability. These classifications are PR1 (previously AS) for arms and shoulders, PR2 (previously TA) for trunk and arm mobility, PR3 (previously LTA) for legs, trunk and arms mobility. There was also previously a mixed boat classification called LTAIDMix4+, which included rowers with intellectual disabilities.\nGovernance.\nThe sport is governed by the Federation Internationale de Societes d'Aviron (FISA).\nEligibility.\n, people with visual and physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport.\nBritish Rowing defines two types of rowers with disabilities:\nHistory.\nAdaptive rowing was taking place in France by 1971, with two classes of rowers initially participating: people with visual disabilities and people recovering from polio. People recovering from polio in France used boats with pontoons in order to increase their stability. Other changes were made to the boat with the development of a hinge-system to prevent rowers from tiring as easily. Blind rowers used the same boats during the 1970s and 1980s as their able-bodied counterparts but were guided on the course by a referee. Blind rowers were also encouraged to be in boats with sighted rowers, with the blind rowers serving as the stroke and the cox paying special attention to help the blinder rower. Classification was not something developed in France in this era as there was a focus on integrating rowers into the regular rowing community.\nAdaptive rowing in the Netherlands began in 1979 with the founding of Stichting Roeivalidatie. There was not an emphasis on classification early on, but rather in integrating adaptive rowing with regular rowing inside of rowing clubs. Attempts were then made to customise equipment to suit an individual rower's specific needs as they related to their disability.\nAdaptive rowing in the United States began in 1981 with the catamaran being the boat first used by rowers with a disability. By 1991, a classification system was in place for domestic competitions, but it was still under development. Many rowers also competed against their able-bodied counterparts during this period.\nAdaptive rowing racing began in Australia in 1988. The first FISA recognised adaptive rowing World Cup event took place in 1991 and held in the Netherlands.\nEarly governance of the sport in Australia was done by the Rowing Council with supporting from the Australian Rowing Association. Early classifications were limited because of the limited number of rowers. In many of the earliest races inside Australia, there were two classes: fixed seats and sliding seats.\nIn 1991 in Great Britain, adaptive rowing was not a large concern. Rowing clubs endeavored to fully integrate rowers with disabilities into regular club races.\nBy 1991, an international classification system was attempting to be developed. These classes were:\nThis early system, called the Functional Classification System was not internationally agreed upon in part because it was not seen as entirely fair as it did not consider rower functionality and correct times based on that. At this time, there was also discussion about whether or not classifications should be created for rowers with intellectual disabilities. In 1992, the International Paralympic Committee formally took control of governance for disability sport.\nClasses.\nAthletes are classified as follows:\nPR3 (previously LTA). Legs, Trunks and Arms. Athletes are able to use a sliding seat and have function in their legs, trunks and arms to row. They may have a visual or physical impairment. Visually impaired athletes will wear blindfolds for vision impairment equality. The three categories of vision impairment used in FISA sport classification for adaptive rowing are B1, B2, and B3, which within PR3 (LTA) adaptive rowing are respectively known as PR3-B1, PR3-B2, PR3-B3.\nPR2 (previously TA). Trunks and Arms. Athletes row with only their trunks and arm functional. They are unable to use a sliding seat due to impairment in the legs.\nPR1 (previously AS). Arms and Shoulders. Athletes row with only their arms and shoulders, as they do not have the use of their trunks or legs.\nRules allow for a rower to compete in a higher functional class than they are currently classified. Rowers may not compete in lower classifications than they have been classified. \nIn the Coxed Four, the maximum number of vision impaired rowers in a boat is two.\nProcess.\nFor Australian competitors in this sport, the sport and classification is managed the national sport federation with support from the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nFor the 2008 Summer Paralympics, classification assignment for this class was handled by FISA. For the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, rowing classification was scheduled forSeptember 8 at Lagoa Stadium, and September 4 to 6 for visually impaired rowers.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."

Only people with lower leg paralysis or lower leg extremity amputations are eligible to compete. \nThe sport is governed by World Paravolley [formerly known as World Organization Volleyball for the Disabled]].\nDefinition.\nSitting volleyball allows for multiple classifications but players effectively play in one class, with eligibility for the sport limited to people with lower leg paralysis or lower leg extremity amputations. This sport has rules that were designed specifically for people with disabilities in mind. Classifications for this sport are based on functional mobility. In total there are three types of classification, whereby only two are eligible to play at international competitions. They are, Disabled (D class), Minimally Disabled (MD), and Abled-Bodied (AB), where the latter is ineligible to play.\nGovernance.\nThe sport's classification process is governed by the World Organization Volleyball for the Disabled.\nHistory.\nBy the early 1990s, sitting volleyball classification had moved away from medical based system to a functional classification system. Because of issues in objectively identifying functionality that plagued the post Barcelona Games, the IPC unveiled plans to develop a new classification system in 2003. This classification system went into effect in 2007, and defined ten different disability types that were eligible to participate on the Paralympic level. It required that classification be sport specific, and served two roles. The first was that it determined eligibility to participate in the sport and that it created specific groups of sportspeople who were eligible to participate and in which class. The IPC left it up to International Federations to develop their own classification systems within this framework, with the specification that their classification systems use an evidence based approach developed through research.\nEligibility.\nPeople with physical disabilities are eligible to compete in this sport. In competitions that are non-sanctioned, such as national cup and league matches, people without disabilities may compete.\nProcess.\nAt the 1996 Summer Paralympics, on the spot classification required that classifiers have access to medical equipment like Snellen charts, reflex hammers, and goniometers to properly classify competitors.\nFor Australian competitors in this sport, the sport is not supported by the Australian Paralympic Committee. There are three types of classification available for Australian competitors: Provisional, national and international. The first is for club level competitions, the second for state and national competitions, and the third for international competitions.\nAt the Paralympic Games.\nAt the 1992 Summer Paralympics, two types of volleyball were played including sitting and amputee, with classification being run through ISOD. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, 26 assessments were conducted at the Games. This resulted in 1 class change.\nFor the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio, the International Paralympic Committee had a zero classification at the Games policy. This policy was put into place in 2014, with the goal of avoiding last minute changes in classes that would negatively impact athlete training preparations. All competitors needed to be internationally classified with their classification status confirmed prior to the Games, with exceptions to this policy being dealt with on a case-by-case basis. In case there was a need for classification or reclassification at the Games despite best efforts otherwise, sitting volleyball classification was scheduled for September 5 and September 6 at Riocentro-Pavilion 6. For sportspeople with physical or intellectual disabilities going through classification or reclassification in Rio, their in competition observation event is their first appearance in competition at the Games.\nFuture.\nGoing forward, disability sport's major classification body, the International Paralympic Committee, is working on improving classification to be more of an evidence-based system as opposed to a performance-based system so as not to punish elite athletes whose performance makes them appear in a higher class alongside competitors who train less."
