        "title": "2012 Stanley Cup Finals",
        "text": "The 2012 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) season, and the culmination of the 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Western Conference playoff champion Los Angeles Kings defeated the Eastern Conference playoff champion New Jersey Devils four games to two, capturing the first Stanley Cup title in the team's 45-year history, dealing the Devils just their second Stanley Cup Finals defeat in five tries and first since . Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player of the playoffs.\nThe Los Angeles Kings made their second appearance in the Finals in franchise history, they lost in their previous appearance to the Montreal Canadiens in five games in . The New Jersey Devils last appeared in , when they defeated the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games to win their third Stanley Cup title. It was the first championship series since 2007 whose Stanley Cup-clinching game was played on the winning team's home ice.\nThe Eastern Conference winner had home ice advantage for the first time since , since the Devils had a better regular season record than the Kings. The Devils were the lowest-seeded team to have home-ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Finals, a record previously held by the Devils when they won the Cup as a fourth seed in . With the Devils entering the playoffs as the ninth seed of the sixteen playoff teams by regular season record (no division titles) and the Kings as the thirteenth, their combined seed of twenty-two was the second highest of any playoff matchup (only trailing the 1991 Cup Finals with twenty-three), and it was the first playoff matchup with no team seeded better than ninth. The Kings became the first, as well as the last eighth-seeded team to win the Stanley Cup since the conference-based seedings were introduced in 1994.\nPaths to the Finals.\nLos Angeles Kings.\nThe Los Angeles Kings historically had not fared well in the postseason, having only progressed beyond second round of the playoffs once in franchise history. There were some highlights in franchise history, such as a dramatic seven-game series loss to the heavily favoured Boston Bruins in 1976, the upset of the top seeded Edmonton Oilers (including the game three Miracle on Manchester) in 1982, and a comeback from a 3–1 series deficit to beat the defending Stanley Cup champion Oilers in 1989. The first time that they advanced to the Conference Finals was in , where the Kings defeated the Toronto Maple Leafs to reach their first Cup Finals in franchise history, where they lost to the Montreal Canadiens. From 1994 to 2011 the Kings won just one playoff series, during the 2001 postseason when they upset the Detroit Red Wings in six games and coming back from a 3–1 deficit to push the eventual Cup champions Colorado Avalanche to seven games.\nThe Kings started the regular season at 13–12–4 before firing head coach Terry Murray on December 12, 2011. John Stevens served as interim coach before the team hired Darryl Sutter on December 20. Under Sutter, the Kings finished the season at 95 points. The Kings lost their final two regular season games to fall from first place in the Pacific Division (and the #3 seed in the West) to third place in the division and eighth in the conference. The Kings won only 40 out 82 games, and with 95 points became first losing record team to finish the season with more than 90 points.\nThe Kings then went on to become the second team to eliminate the first, second and thirds seeds from the playoffs in the same postseason (and the first team to do so in that order), after the 2003–04 Calgary Flames, also coached by Darryl Sutter, eliminating the Vancouver Canucks in five games, the St. Louis Blues in four games, and the Phoenix Coyotes in five games. In addition, the Kings went a perfect 8–0 on the road in these playoff games and the first team to go undefeated while en route to the Finals.\nThe Kings are the second eighth seed to reach the Finals, following the Edmonton Oilers in (the Oilers lost out to the Carolina Hurricanes in seven games). Kings players Jarret Stoll and Matt Greene were part of that Oilers team in 2006, while teammate Justin Williams played for the Cup-winning Hurricanes.\nNew Jersey Devils.\nThe Devils started the season having missed the playoffs in the 2010–11 season for the first time since 1995–96 season, breaking a 13-year consecutive postseason appearance streak. This was the Devils' first season under head coach Peter DeBoer, who replaced the retiring Jacques Lemaire during the offseason. Under DeBoer, New Jersey finished the regular season with 102 points, but ended up with the sixth seed in the Eastern Conference playoffs.\nThe Devils eliminated DeBoer's former team, the Southeast division-winning Florida Panthers, in seven games, and two of their division rivals, first the fifth-seeded Philadelphia Flyers in five games, and the first-seeded New York Rangers in six games.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nLos Angeles scored first on Colin Fraser's goal at 9:56 of the first period.The Kings then held the Devils without a shot on goal for the first 14 minutes of the second period, but could not increase their lead. The Devils tied the game at 18:48 of the second period when Anton Volchenkov's shot bounced off of Kings defenceman Slava Voynov and into the Los Angeles net. At 3:58 of the third period, a Devils goal was waved off when Zach Parise illegally pushed the puck with his hand over the Kings goal line. Anze Kopitar beat Martin Brodeur on a breakaway goal 8:13 into overtime to give the Kings a 2–1 win in game one.\nWith the win, the Kings became the first team to win their first nine road games in a single postseason.\nGame two.\nThe Kings extended their 2012 playoff road winning streak to ten with another 2–1 overtime victory. This time, it was Jeff Carter who scored at 13:42 of the extra period. After Carter's initial shot from the right side was stopped, he then went around the net to grab the puck on the other side and then made a shot through traffic that beat Martin Brodeur. Los Angeles scored first on Drew Doughty's unassisted goal at 7:49 of the first period. The Devils tied the game at 2:59 of the third period when Ryan Carter deflected Marek Zidlicky's shot into the Kings' net. Neither team could take advantage of their power plays, nor on a 4-on-4 late in the third period. Both teams had more shots than game one; Jonathan Quick made 32 out of 33 saves, while Brodeur made 30 out of 32.\nGame three.\nLos Angeles scored four goals, and Jonathan Quick stopped all 22 New Jersey shots, as the Kings defeated the Devils 4–0. The Kings' first goal at 5:58 of the second period was controversial. Dwight King's original shot against Martin Brodeur was stopped, but King kept on swiping the puck until Alec Martinez finally pushed it across the goal line. Brodeur argued that he had the puck covered up just before Martinez's shot, but the officials did not blow the play dead and the goal stood.&gt; The Kings' scored their second goal at 15:07 of the third period when Justin Williams sent a pass near the boards to Dustin Brown, who then passed to Anze Kopitar on the other side, who then lifted the puck over Brodeur. In the third period, two New Jersey penalties led to two Los Angeles power play goals. Meanwhile, New Jersey could not score off of Los Angeles' five penalties during the game, including Jeff Carter's high-sticking double-minor in the first period that led to a Devils 5 on 3 for about a minute.\nThis contest also saw the return of Kings' left winger Simon Gagne, who had been out of the Los Angeles lineup since December 26, 2011, due to a head injury. Gagne, who played in the Stanley Cup Finals for the second time in three years, took Brad Richardson's spot in the lineup. In 2010, Gagne, along with current Kings teammates Mike Richards and Jeff Carter, were members of the Philadelphia Flyers that lost to the Chicago Blackhawks in six games.\nWith the win, the Kings became the first team in NHL history to take a 3–0 series lead in all four rounds of the playoffs.\nGame four.\nNew Jersey avoided being swept for the first time in team history when Adam Henrique scored at 15:29 of the third period to break a 1–1 tie, and Ilya Kovalchuk added an empty-netter with 19.1 seconds left, defeating the Kings 3–1, and forcing a fifth game. This marked the third time in this playoffs that the Kings failed to close out a series in game four after winning the first three games. The game remained scoreless until 7:56 of the third period when Patrik Elias shot a rebound into the Los Angeles net, giving New Jersey their first lead of the series. This lead was cut short a minute later, as David Clarkson was called for boarding at 8:52, and four seconds later Drew Doughty tied the game with a power play goal for the Kings. With the loss, the Kings failed to match the record set by the Edmonton Oilers, who was the last team to lose only two games in their 1988 championship run with at least 16 required games played in a four-round format.\nGame five.\nThe Devils gave the Kings their only playoff road loss with a 2–1 victory, ending their 10-game road-winning streak, and became the first club since the Detroit Red Wings in to come back from a 3–0 deficit in the Cup Finals to force a game six. New Jersey scored first at 12:45 of the first period, their first power play goal of the series, after Jonathan Quick misplayed the puck and Zach Parise found an open net on the other side before the Los Angeles goalie could recover. The Kings tied the game at 3:26 of the second when Justin Williams took a pass from Matt Greene, skated into the New Jersey zone and beat Martin Brodeur. But the Devils took the lead for good at 9:05 of the second when Bryce Salvador's shot deflected off of Kings defenceman Slava Voynov into the Los Angeles net. Jarret Stoll's goal at 11:16 of the second period, which would have tied the game, was waved off because he shot it with a high-stick. The Devils later held on for the final minute of the game on a 4-on-4 and the Kings pulling their goalie for the extra attacker on what became essentially a 5-on-4 advantage.\nGame six.\nThe Kings defeated the Devils 6–1 to capture the series and win their first Stanley Cup in team history. This was the most lopsided Cup-clinching game since , when the Pittsburgh Penguins won game six by beating the Minnesota North Stars 8–0. At 10:10 of the first period, New Jersey's Steve Bernier was assessed a major boarding penalty and a game misconduct on a hit to Los Angeles' Rob Scuderi. The Kings then put the game out of reach by scoring three goals on the ensuing five-minute power play (when a major penalty is assessed, the full five-minute penalty must be served)—the first by Dustin Brown, the second by Jeff Carter, and the third by Trevor Lewis.\nCarter then beat Martin Brodeur to score his second goal of the game at 1:50 of the second period after Anton Volchenkov collided with a linesman while trying to defend Brown, who was carrying the puck into the New Jersey Zone. Unimpeded after Volchenkov was screened from the play, Brown easily got the pass off to Carter. Adam Henrique got the Devils' lone goal at 18:45 of the second period after getting the rebound off of a shot by Petr Sykora. Lewis added an empty net goal at 16:15 of the third period after Brodeur was pulled for an extra attacker. With Brodeur back in the net, Matt Greene scored the Kings' sixth goal of the game 15 seconds later.\nRegarding Bernier's game-changing penalty, Rich Chere of \"The Star-Ledger\" wrote that it was \"the most devastating call in the Stanley Cup finals since the illegal curve on Marty McSorley's stick in \". Several Devils fans and other observers believed that there was inconsistency with the officials' calls, and that they missed a couple of calls on the Kings at the time of that hit, such as one Jarret Stoll made on the Devils' Stephen Gionta. With the win, the Kings became only the second California-based NHL team to win the Stanley Cup, following the Anaheim Ducks, who beat Ottawa in , the 12th expansion team to win it, and the second-to-last of the surviving 1967 expansion teams to do so (in 2019, the St. Louis Blues became the last remaining franchise from the 1967 expansion to win the Cup).\nNotes.\nThe 2012 Stanley Cup Finals marked the first time two American-born captains faced off in the championship series of the NHL as Dustin Brown of Los Angeles battled against Zach Parise of New Jersey. This scenario ensured a second time in league history of an American-born captain leading his team to the Stanley Cup championship. Derian Hatcher of the Dallas Stars was the first American-born captain to do so, leading his team over the Buffalo Sabres in .\nThese finals guaranteed the lowest-seeded Stanley Cup champion in history. New Jersey, as a fifth seed, won the Stanley Cup in . With the Kings' victory, they became the first team ever to win the Stanley Cup as the eighth seed. They are also the second team to win the Stanley Cup without having home ice advantage in any of the four rounds of the playoffs, also after the Devils in 1995.\nThe Kings are the fourth consecutive team to win the Stanley Cup after opening the season in Europe as part of the NHL Premiere Series. Previous NHL Premiere participants (Pittsburgh—, Chicago—, Boston—) went on to win the Cup.\nJonathan Quick became the third American Conn Smythe Trophy winner, following previous winners Brian Leetch () and Tim Thomas (2011).\nTeam rosters.\nYears indicated in boldface under the \"Finals appearance\" column signify that the player won the Stanley Cup in the given year.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2012 Stanley Cup was presented to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman, following the Kings 6–1 win over the New Jersey Devils in the sixth game of the finals.\nThe following Kings players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2011–12 Los Angeles Kings\nOfficials.\nThe following officials were chosen for the Stanley Cup Finals:\nTelevision.\nIn Canada, the series was televised in English on CBC and in French on the cable network RDS. In the United States, NBC broadcast the first two and the final two games, while the NBC Sports Network televised games three and four.\nThe 2012 Final rated poorly in comparison to the four most recent Stanley Cup Finals on United States television. The first four games were marred by low ratings; had the series ended in four games, this series would have produced the lowest television ratings ever for a championship series of any major league sport. However, game five and game six produced somewhat higher ratings than the first four games, which gave the 2012 Final a slightly higher rating than the Final (which was on par with the Final); the 2007 Final therefore remains the lowest-rated championship series in American television history."

It was the first ever W.A.K.O. championships to be held in Eastern Europe.\nThe event was open to amateur men, and for the first time ever, women were allowed to compete (this was the same for the London event). The men had two categories, Full-Contact and Semi-Contact, while the women competed in Semi-Contact only. Unlike London there was no Musical Forms although there was an additional Semi-Contact team event. Some countries was allowed more than one competitor in certain weight categories in the men's and women's events due to limited numbers and some competitors in the men's events competed in more than one category. By the end of the championships, the top nation in terms of medals won was France, Great Britain were in second with Italy in third. The event was held in Budapest, Hungary on Saturday, 2 November 1985 in front of an estimated 20,000 spectators.\nMen's Full-Contact Kickboxing.\nAs with the London event there were ten weight classes in Full-Contact although some of the division were slightly different at the heavier end of the spectrum - ranging from 54 kg/118.8 lbs to over 87 kg/+191.4 lbs. All bouts were fought under Full-Contact rules with more detail on the rules being provided at the W.A.K.O. website - although be aware that the rules may have changed slightly since 1985. One of the notable winners was Chiarrochi who had also won a gold at the 1983 world championships, while compatriot Olivier Gruner (who would later have a career as an actor in Hollywood) won silver in the 75 kg category. France was the top nation in Full-Contact by the end of the championships, winning three golds and four silvers.\nSemi-Contact Kickboxing.\nSemi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fights were won on points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited - more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1985. In the men's division there were seven weight divisions ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs. By the end of the championships the top nation in men's Semi-Contact was Great Britain with two golds and one silver medal.\nAs with the London event, for the first time ever women were allowed to compete at a W.A.K.O. championships. The only category on offer was Semi-Contact with just two weight divisions; under 60 kg/132 lbs and over 60 kg/+132 lbs. The rules were similar to the men's - a full version can be found on the W.A.K.O. website although be aware that the rules will have changed somewhat since 1985. Due to the somewhat smaller amount of nations competing some nations were allowed more than one competitor per weight division. By the end of the championships Hungary was the strongest nation in women's Semi-Contact, winning one gold, one silver and one bronze medal. There was also an additional team event of which Great Britain came away with gold."

Philippines' highest achievement was they qualified and competed at the FIVB Volleyball Women's World Championship in 1974 edition, where they finished at 18th place.\nHistory.\nThe Philippine national team was formerly organized and sanctioned by the Philippine Volleyball Federation (PVF), originally known as the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (PAVA) from 1961 to 2003. The team was a regional powerhouse in Southeast Asia having won gold medals at the 1977, 1979, 1981, 1985, 1987 and 1993 editions of the Southeast Asian Games. The Philippines also participated at its first and only FIVB Volleyball World Championship in 1974.\nThe national team had its last gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games finish under Russian-Latvian head coach Staņislavs Lugailo, who was part of the Soviet Union men's national team that won gold at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, was hired to lead the team in 1990. He guided the team to its bronze medal finish at the 1991 Southeast Asian Games. The national team had a training camp in Japan in 1992 where it played games against Japanese volleyball clubs. Lyugailo later led the national team to win a gold medal at the Southeast Asian Games in 1993 defeating defending champions Thailand in the final. Thailand would later defeat the Philippines in the next edition in 1995 in the gold medal match. The Philippines fail to duplicate its gold medal games for the next editions of the Southeast Asian Games with Thailand establishing dominance in women's volleyball in the region.\nThe Philippine national team did not see international play after the 2005 edition of the Southeast Asian Games and the Asian Championships. The Philippines won a bronze medal at the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. They would make a comeback at the Asian Championships in 2013 and at the Southeast Asian Games in 2015 respectively.\nIn 2014, the PVF lost recognition of the Philippine Olympic Committee after a leadership crisis. The Fédération Internationale de Volleyball (FIVB) recognized the Larong Volleyball sa Pilipinas, Inc. (LVPI) as its provisional member in 2015 effectively taking over the PVF's mandate. The LVPI was allowed to send and organize national volleyball teams, including the women's team to FIVB tournaments for the next few years.\nAfter failing to get a podium finish at the 2015 Southeast Asian Games, it was decided that the national team coached by Roger Gorayeb will be disbanded. However it is later decided that Gorayeb will remain coach of the national team which participated in another tournament, the 2015 VTV International Women's Volleyball Cup. The team finish last out of six teams and was without many of its players that played in the Southeast Asian Games.\nIn 2021, the Philippine National Volleyball Federation (PNVF) was formed and was given full FIVB membership replacing the LVPI as the volleyball federation for volleyball in the Philippines.\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\nFormer squads.\n2018 Asian Games.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2017 Asian Women's Volleyball Championship.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2015 Asian Women's Championship.\nCoaching staff\nTeam Staff\nMedical Staff\n2022 Asian Women's Volleyball Cup.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2018 Asian Women's Volleyball Cup.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2023 Asian Volleyball Challenge Cup.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2023 Southeast Asian Games.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2021 Southeast Asian Games.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2019 Southeast Asian Games.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2017 Southeast Asian Games.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2015 Southeast Asian Games.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n2023 SEA Women's V.League.\nFirst Leg.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\nSecond Leg.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2022 ASEAN Grand Prix.\nThe following persons were assigned by the Philippine National Volleyball Federation as part of the coaching staff.\n2019 ASEAN Grand Prix.\nFirst leg.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\nSecond leg.\nCoaching staff\nTeam staff\nMedical staff\n Clarence Estban\n2015 VTV Cup.\nCoaching staff\nYouth teams.\nPrevious squads.\nCoaching staff \nTeam staff\n Marissa Andres\nMedical staff\n Clarence Esteban\nCoaching staff\nTeam Staff\nMedical Staff\nIn 2016, the Under-19 team finished 10th among 15 teams in the 2016 Asian Women's U19 Volleyball Championship.

        "text": "Ryan Murphy (born March 31, 1993) is a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman currently playing with EC Red Bull Salzburg in the ICE Hockey League (ICEHL). He was originally drafted in the first round, 12th overall, by the Carolina Hurricanes during the 2011 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nMurphy was selected by the Kitchener Rangers third overall in the 2009 Ontario Hockey League (OHL) Bantam Draft. He began his first season as a 16-year-old and led the OHL in rookie defencemen scoring, scoring 39 points in 62 games playing on a defensive pairing with Columbus Blue Jackets first-rounder John Moore. He followed up his stellar rookie campaign by helping the Rangers proceed to the third round of the OHL playoffs with 17 points in 20 games, leading the Rangers in defence scoring.\nMurphy broke out his sophomore season, leading the OHL in defencemen goal scoring with 26 goals. He added to that with 53 assists for 79 points in 63 games, good enough for second in OHL in defencemen scoring behind Windsor Spitfires defenceman Ryan Ellis.\nMurphy was named to the OHL First Team All-Star team for the 2010–11 season. On June 24, 2011, Murphy was drafted 12th overall by the Carolina Hurricanes in the NHL Entry Draft, reuniting with former Kitchener Rangers teammate Jeff Skinner. On September 16, 2011, Murphy signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Hurricanes.\nWhen the Hurricanes' final 23-man roster was released on October 5, 2011, Murphy was on it, and he began the 2011–12 season in the NHL. On October 13, the Hurricanes returned Murphy to his OHL team, the Kitchener Rangers. Murphy suffered a severe concussion on November 4, during a game against the Niagara IceDogs. Consequently, he was placed in \"complete shutdown mode\" by the Rangers.\nOn September 18, 2012, Murphy was named captain of the Kitchener Rangers. During the 2012–13 season, on February 21, 2013, Murphy made his NHL debut with the Carolina Hurricanes. He made the Hurricanes' opening night roster for the 2013–14 season. On October 6, 2013, he scored his first career NHL point, assisting on a Jay Harrison goal.\nOn June 29, 2017, Murphy (along with goaltender Eddie Läck and a seventh-round draft pick) was traded to the Calgary Flames in exchange for prospect Keegan Kanzig and a sixth-round pick in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. The following day, on June 30, the Flames announced Murphy was placed on unconditional waivers to buy-out the remaining year of his contract. The following day, on July 1, Murphy signed as a free agent to a one-year, two-way contract with the Minnesota Wild.\nDuring the 2018–19 season, on January 30, 2019, the Wild traded Murphy to the New Jersey Devils in exchange for Michael Kapla. Assigned to AHL affiliate, the Binghamton Devils, Murphy appeared in 2 games before he was recalled to New Jersey on February 9, 2019. In his Devils debut, Murphy had a primary assist on a Pavel Zacha opening goal, helping the Devils to a 3–2 victory over former club, the Carolina Hurricanes, on February 10, 2019. He was returned to the AHL the following day. On June 25, 2019, Murphy was not tendered a qualifying offer to remain with the Devils, making him a free agent.\nWith his NHL prospects dwindling, Murphy opted to move his career abroad, agreeing to a one-year contract with Russian club HC Neftekhimik Nizhnekamsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), on July 27, 2019. In his lone season in Russia with Nizhnekamsk in the 2019–20 season, Murphy recorded 8 goals and 23 points in 56 regular season games. He made 4 playoff appearances, going scoreless in a series sweep defeat to Ak Bars Kazan.\nA free agent, Murphy opted to return to North America, agreeing to a one-year AHL contract with the newly founded Henderson Silver Knights, affiliate of the Vegas Golden Knights, on August 14, 2020. With the 2020–21 season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to stay in shape Murphy returned to the KHL on loan from the Silver Knights, agreeing to a stint with Belarusian club HC Dinamo Minsk on November 14, 2020. He made 12 appearances on the blueline with Minsk, adding 8 points, before he was returned to the Silver Knights on December 27, 2020.\nFollowing a successful season with the Silver Knights, Murphy secured a one-year, two-way contract with the Detroit Red Wings on July 28, 2021. He played the season exclusively with the Red Wings' AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins.\nA free agent from the Red Wings, Murphy opted to return to the Russian KHL, securing a one-year contract with Salavat Yulaev Ufa on June 29, 2022.\nInternational play.\nMurphy was cut from the Canadian 2010 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament team despite a great performance during the tryout camp. Murphy would later be selected to the Canadian world junior camp in December, where he was one of the final cuts.\nDuring the World Under-18s in April 2011, Murphy had an impressive tournament, scoring 13 points and leading the tournament in defencemen scoring, as well as leading Canada to a fourth-place finish as their leading scorer. He was named Defenceman of the Tournament. On the back of his performance, Murphy was invited to take part in Canada's 2011 national junior team selection camp \nMurphy was named to Team Canada in his final year of eligibility for the 2013 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. It was Murphy's third time trying out for Canada's national U20 team."

He was initially an outfielder in Philadelphia's farm system before being converted to pitching in 1987.\nPlaying Career.\nThe Philadelphia Phillies drafted Tom Newell in the 24th round of the MLB draft. He and fellow pitcher John Costello were the only players drafted in that low round that actually ended up making it to the majors. Newell made his professional debut as an outfielder in the Phillies minor league system, but after two seasons, he was converted into a pitcher. The Spartanburg Suns finished with a 66-70 record, and Newell, along with Bob Scanlan both finished the season with double digit losses. \nIn 1986, Newell started out with Philadelphia's single A team in Clearwater, but ended up making the jump to Portland, the triple A team. After the season was over, Philadelphia dropped Portland and signed an agreement to make the Maine Guides their new Triple A farm club. Newell was struggling with Maine, that however, did not sway Philadelphia from promoting him to the major league club.\nTom Newell played two games in the majors, his last occurring September 18, 1987. Called in to relieve starter Bruce Ruffin, Newell proceeded to record the final out to get out of the inning. He started the fourth inning, and after walking two batters, giving up two hits, and allowing two runs, he was lifted from the game, and relieved by Freddie Toliver. After the game, Newell was demoted to the minor leagues.\nCast off by Philadelphia after the 1988 season, Newell was out of baseball in 1989, and signed a minor league deal with the New York Yankees in 1990, in hopes of reviving his career. After a terrible stint with Triple A Columbus after being promoted from Double A, Newell was released by the Yankees, and he never pitched another game in organized ball. "

        "title": "Connecticut Golf Hall of Fame",
        "text": "The Connecticut Golf Hall of Fame honors people with connections to the state of Connecticut for their achievements and contributions in the sport of golf. The Hall of Fame was created in the mid-1950s by noted local golf journalist Skip Henderson. The event was originally organized by Greater Hartford Jaycees and the Connecticut Sports Writers' Alliance. During the first phase of the ceremony, the award was bestowed equally to obscure amateurs and famous professional golfers. By the 1980s, however, the Hall was disestablished. However, in 1991, under the auspices of the Connection State Golf Association, the Hall of Fame induction ceremony was renewed.\nHistory.\nIn November 1954, \"The Hartford Times\" sportswriter Charles Stuart \"Skip\" Henderson, Jr. brought up the idea of creating a state golf Hall of Fame to the Greater Hartford Jaycees. The organization was instituted the following February. The organization was created through a collaboration between the Jaycees and the Connecticut Sports Writers' Alliance. The purpose of the Hall of Fame, it was later described, was to \"[recognize] an individual who has state connections, participated in a golf-related activity in Connecticut and has brought honor through golf endeavors at the state, regional, or national levels.\"\nThe first induction ceremony was held at the Golf Club of Avon in April 1955. It was held during the third annual Connecticut PGA Spring Golf Show. The selection was completed by the sportswriters of Connecticut. Robert M. Grant was the unanimous choice for the award. Grant was a leading amateur golfer and president of the Connection State Golf Association (CSGA), the New England Golf Association, and Wethersfield Country Club. In 1956, the ceremony began to be held at Wethersfield Country Club after the conclusion of the Insurance City Open, a local PGA Tour event held at the club. The selections continued to be determined by the Connecticut Sports Writers Alliance.\nIn the early years, the awards' distribution alternated between star professional golfers and obscure local golfers. After Grant's selection, local amateur golfers Charles C. Clare, W.W. \"Mike\" Sherman, and Frank D. Ross won the award. In 1959, the award went to pathbreaking female golfer Georgianna Bishop. In 1960, electrician and former Connecticut Amateur champion, H.H. Mandly won the award. Following that, legendary golfers Julius Boros and Gene Sarazen won the award consecutively. Immediately thereafter, former U.S. Open champions Billy Burke and Tony Manero earned Hall of Fame honors in respective years.\nBy the late 1960s, the ceremony moved to Glastonbury Hills Country Club in Glastonbury, Connecticut and then Elmhurst Country Club in East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. During this era, the award was bestowed upon Dr. Ted Lenczyk, a dentist and former Connecticut Open champion, and his sister, Grace Lenczyk Cronin, a star amateur golfer in the 1940s. In the early 1970s, the ceremony returned to the Golf Club of Avon. Despite the changes in location, the awards ceremony was consistently conducted at the annual Connecticut PGA Spring Golf Show. During this era, the event was still sponsored by the Jaycees and the election process was consistently decided by the local sportswriters. In late 1983, however, the ceremony ceased to exist.\nIn 1991 the awards were \"reinstituted.\" The CSGA, not the sportswriters, now \"assumed administration\" of the ceremony. During this era, several CSGA executives earned honors. In 1991, former executive for the CSGA, Marty Moraghan, earned the award. \"I can't tell you what this means to me,\" said Moraghan, \"to be in the same company as Dick Siderowf and Bobby Grant is something I'll never forget.\" The following year, Jim Killington, another executive for the association, was inducted. In 1997, former CSGA executive director Russ Palmer was inducted. Palmer was instrumental in merging the CSGA with Connection Section PGA.\nIn the early 21st century, a number of awards were distributed posthumously to early 20th century golf figures. In 2000 and 2001, the award was dispensed, respectively, to leading 1920s professional Johnny Golden, and the amateur Dick Chapman, former US Amateur and British Amateur champion. In 2005, Skip Henderson, the sportswriter who originated the idea of a Hall of Fame, was selected for the award.\nInductees.\nSource:"

The choice was made primarily on Green's size, speed and jumping ability. Green and his agent spoke to the Chargers but despite the money he was being offered to change sports, he decided that he wanted to continue playing basketball.\nThe following month, Green was selected by the Phoenix Suns in the third round of the 1979 NBA draft with the 64th overall pick.

        "title": "Volleyball spiking",
        "text": "In volleyball, spiking is the offensive play where a player swings the ball with their palm sharply downwards over the net and into the opposing court, making it difficult for the opposing team to recover the ball. The mechanism of spiking is unique to volleyball, but its counterparts in other sports include slam dunking in basketball, smashing in tennis, or shooting in association football.\nVolleyball spiking became very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the massive proliferation of beach volleyball as a popular sport. Well known beach professionals such as Karch Kiraly used the volleyball spike to score devastating points on their opponents as well as wow the crowd with the spike's air of theatricality. \"Spiking\" as it related to volleyball entered the international and American lexicon through video games, movies and the growing popularity of the AVP.\nIn 1916 the \"set\" and \"spike\" was created in the Philippines where the six-sided play and three hits per side rule were instituted in the following years.\nThe spike is the most effective attack in high levels of play, used by each team to score points. It is generally on the third and final touch and involves an approach with footwork, a jump, and then an attack. It is a high-velocity shot with explosive movements that send the ball over the net which usually generates the most points during the game. The setter will usually toss the ball to the attacker, called a set, who will choose which attack they want to perform. As the spike requires highly coordinated movement patterns in the approach, the swing, and the landing, it is one of the more difficult skills to master in volleyball.\nTypes.\nRegular spike.\nThe basic type of spike which, following the jump, the player draws the preferred hitting arm back, and the other arm pointing up, similar to a cocked bow. This is followed by a whip-like action of the hitting arm, striking the ball with the hand at full extension. This spike keeps the elbow above the shoulder throughout the entire swing. Contacting the back of the ball with an open hand in the shape of the ball will create top spin. The spike must be contacted above the net so that the ball be directed steeply downwards.\nThe hand position helps with avoiding or hitting around the block. An angle or cross court shot involves wrapping the hand around the inside of the ball with the thumb down. To hit cut-back shots, the hand is wrapped around the outside of the ball with the thumb up, the hit requires a full follow through by the arm.\nDinks.\nAn attack which is used to deceive the opposing blockers and tip the ball over the blocker’s hands onto an open area behind them. Instead of the player swinging hard at the ball, they reach high with an extended elbow, contacting with only the fingertips. Is commonly done when blockers have all paths covered or they are expecting a strong hit. Furthermore, is more effective when blockers are using swing blocking techniques which has a longer hang time that can be taken advantage of.\nRolls.\nSimilar to the dink where it is usually done to deceive the opposing blockers, the player starts with the complete aggressive approach, then near the jump, extends their arm forward and uses a circular motion to roll the ball over the blockers with top spin into the empty court space behind them, endeavoring to catch the back court defenders off guard.\nScoring off the Block / Tooling / Wipes.\nFollowing the normal approach, a spike which aims for the blocker's hand nearest to the sideline to bounce off of into out of bounds. This counts as a point for the attacking team due to the last contact before out of bounds belonging to the defending team. Is usually executed by higher level players.\nBack Row Attacks.\nUsually, players in the back of the court do not participate in the attacks as they are not allowed to hit the ball in front of the attack line. However, this attack is legal as long as they jump with both feet behind the attack line to attack a ball. Different signals are used to convey what attacks they want to execute with the setter/team such as \"A\", \"B\" (or \"pipe\"), and \"C\", where they correspond to the left, middle and right side of the court respectfully. Sometimes, the back-row player may receive the serve first, and then quickly position deep enough in the court to conduct a full approach.\nThe Slide.\nAn attack where the approach is modified and only one foot is used for take-off. If the player is able to take a running approach along the length of the net instead of towards the net, they will be able use a one-foot takeoff effectively.\nIt is most commonly used by a middle attacker who runs behind the setter and chases a back seat to the end of the court. The momentum of the player horizontally will often carry them out of bounds after the jump, so they have to quickly recover to get back into position for the next play.\nIn the case of a middle attacker, they will move around the back of the setter and jump driving the knee on the same side as the preferred hitting hand, taking off the other foot. Simultaneously, the players hands will raise and draw into the bow position ready to swing on the ball.\nDown Balls.\nWhen the ball is not in a position where an attack can be set up on the third hit, a team usually doesn't want to give a free ball to the other side. This is a hit done from the middle of the court similar to a top spin serve without jumping which can be aimed to a certain area on the opposing teams court to still be an effective attack. Players often hit to the deep corner of the opposing team's court. The player quickly moves behind the ball and draw their arms back like a bow. As the ball approaches, the players foot opposite to their preferred hitting arm comes forward, and the hitting arm swings forward contacting with an open palm to create top spin on the ball. Another tactic sometimes employed is to hit the ball towards the opposing team's setter to make them take the first touch, hence stopping them from being able to set the ball on the second touch.\nThe Approach.\nThe approach is essential for getting enough speed and height to execute a spike. The player starts with their arms hanging naturally at their sides, around 3 metres from the net, behind the attack line. The approach consists of three steps, towards the net at a 45-degree angle starting with the opposite leg of the hitting hand with the arms swinging forward, the next step is a running step on the other foot, often called the directional step. This step allows for the player to adjust to the set and position accordingly, the player accelerates towards the net with step and drives their arms back for momentum in the jump. The final step is done by the starting foot to restore balance and so the player can jump off of both feet, transferring the momentum from the previous step into vertical movement. Often a heel strike is incorporated in the last two steps to brake and prevent net violations. Both hands are swung forward to add momentum and to get into position for the spike form.\nLanding.\nThe significant amount of volleyball landings subject the lower limb joints of players to high forces, which may cause acute or overuse injuries. A review found 54 acute injuries, 30% of which were to the knee, 17% to the ankle, and 17% to the fingers in 178 professional beach volleyball players during a 7.5 week period. A proper two-footed landing is important as one-footed landings result in one leg absorbing more force, increasing risk of injury.\nTiming.\nA crucial part of the attack, and perhaps the hardest, is the timing. Often new players will struggle with knowing when they should begin their approach towards the ball. Timings of the attack are often referred to as tempos. There are three main tempos: first, second, and third.\nFirst tempo is when the attacker takes all their steps for the approach before the ball is set. This is easier for the attacker, but harder for the setter as they must do a quick set to get the ball to the attacker. A common example of an attack using first tempo is the quick middle attack where the middle blocker finishes their approach and jumps at the same time that the setter contacts the ball. This attack is risky but puts a lot of pressure on the opposing middle blocker to stay in the middle to stop the attack instead of going to either side.\nSecond tempo is when some of the steps are taken prior to the setter's contact with the ball, and the rest are taken after. This set is less risky than first but still gives the opposing blockers less time to react to the set.\nThird tempo attacks are when the attacker takes all their steps after the setter has contacted the ball. Third tempo sets usually occur when the team isn't in proper positions to attack, and more time is needed."

It is one of the longest cricket match series in Sri Lanka, having been played for over 119 years. It is played at the Galle International Stadium. Lovers' Quarrel began in 1905, under the two principals Rev. James Horne Darrel of Richmond College and Sir. Frank Lee Woodward of Mahinda College. \nMatch history &amp; Series summary.\nRichmond - Mahinda cricket big match was played for the first time in 1905 at Galle esplanade, with the two principals, Rev. J. H. Darrell of Richmond and Mr. F. L. Woodward of Mahinda, officiating as umpires. Richmond College won the inaugural match and went on to win the next two matches in 1906 and 1907. Mahinda College's first victory was registered in 1908 and their last victory in a big match was recorded in 2008, while Richmond College's last win was recorded in 2019. Having broken a 30-year-long deadlock of draws, Mahindians registered an emphatic 10 wicket win over Richmondites in the 2008 encounter. After a 45-year-long winless streak, Richmondites also registered a win by an innings over Mahindians in the 2014 encounter and continued to a second consecutive win by an innings in 2015.\nIn 1953, Mahindian Somasiri Ambawatte captured all ten Richmond’s wickets in an innings to claim the bowling record of the series and in the same match he scored a century to record the finest all round feat in the history of the big match. In 1972, Prasad Kariyawasam of Richmond College erased a 33-year-old big match record of 155 runs held by Mahindian Sirisena Hettige, with an unbeaten 156 runs. On the very next day of the same match Mahindians piled up the highest score by a team, when they totaled 359 with their top order batsman P. H. K. H. Ranasinghe scoring 162. It is the current record for the highest individual score by a batsman in the big match series. Jayantha Dias of Richmond College holds the record for most centuries in the big match, scoring consecutive centuries in 1968 &amp; 1969."

        "text": "The Basketball Fix is a 1951 noir sports drama film directed by Felix E. Feist and starring John Ireland, Marshall Thompson and Vanessa Brown. The film is also known by the alternative title The Big Decision in the United Kingdom. It is based on the CCNY point shaving scandal.\nPlot.\nSports journalist Peter Ferredey tries to prevent promising college basketball player Johnny Long from becoming involved with a betting ring, but is unable to stop him from shaving points during games for gambler Mike Taft.\nProduction.\nBasketball betting had existed for many years but grew during the 1940s. Since the start of college doubleheaders (two games in a row) at Madison Square Garden in 1934 and the invention of spread betting by Charles K. McNeil circa 1940, gamblers \"embraced the excitement of college basketball and the financial possibilities of betting the spread\". Still, the general public considered amateur college basketball \"pure\", and it was not until 1951, after multiple trials resulting from the CCNY point shaving scandal, when awareness of college basketball gambling centered in New York became widespread. Based on this scandal, Realart Pictures released \"The Basketball Fix\" in 1951. Edward Leven produced it; Peter R. Brooke and Charles Peck Jr. wrote the screenplay. The book \"Basketball in America\" states, \"This movie exploited the fascination people had with the daily media reports of the actual investigation and the subsequent trials.\" The film had to do with both \"society and basketball\".\nRelease.\nThe film was shown nationwide beginning in 1951, including at the Palace Theatre in New York City, the Majestic Theatre in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, and the Roxy Theatre in Decatur, Alabama. Alpha Video, Digiview Entertainment, and St. Clair Entertainment Group released it on DVD.\nReception.\nA review in \"The New York Times\" said, \"While \"The Basketball Fix\" is on the timid side, it is worth the effort put into it, and points the way to better and more constructive social comments.\" \"The Decatur Daily\" wrote, \"When Hollywood unlimbers its big cameras and turns the heat of a spotlight on a dramatic situation like \"The Basketball Fix\"...you can generally count on plenty of fireworks – and you won't be disappointed this time.\" A \"TV Guide\" review said, \"Surprisingly, the scandal in \"The Basketball Fix\" was small potatoes compared to the one that rocked the real basketball world in 1951.\""

His debut was described as \"a very brilliant first appearance\" and he was described as a first-rate half-back, a quick starter, with a very fair amount of pace, an unselfish player, and good tackle. His second and final match was on 5 February 1877 at The Oval in the England vs Ireland match. This match was the first international to be played with fifteen a-side, making Hutchinson one of the few players to have played international matches in both 20 and 15 a-side eras. Eight minutes into the match Hutchinson ran in for a try and later scored again, making him England's record try scorer at that point.\nHutchinson's military career was to take him to India and it was this which curtailed his rugby playing career.

        "text": "Patrick O'Neal Howell (born August 31, 1968) is a former professional baseball player. He played part of one season in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets in 1992, primarily as a center fielder. He also played one season in the Chinese Professional Baseball League in 1998. Howell's strength as an athlete was blazing speed. He stole a lot of bases in the minor leagues and exhibited brilliant defense as a centerfielder wherever he played, including in the major leagues as a member of the New York Mets. However, he was not a strong hitter.\nEarly life.\nHowell was born in Mobile, Alabama and attended Vigor High School in Prichard, Alabama.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Mets.\nThe Mets initially drafted Howell in the 9th round of the 1987 amateur draft. After playing with their minor league baseball system for five seasons, he made his major league debut in 1992. He got a hit in his first big league at bat against the Astros' Pete Harnisch. That season, he batted a .187 with no home runs and 1 run batted in in 79 at bats over 31 games.\nMinor leagues and overseas.\nAfter the 1992 season, he was traded to the Minnesota Twins for Darren Reed. After playing one season in their farm system without returning to the majors, he became a free agent and re-signed with the Mets. After one season with the Mets, he left the affiliated minors, playing in the Mexican League from 1995 to 1997.\nIn 1998, Howell crossed the Pacific to play for the Brother Elephants in Taiwan, batting .264 in 24 games. He returned to the United States in 1999 with the Duluth–Superior Dukes in the Northern League. He played the next four seasons with the Nashua Pride of the Atlantic League before suffering a knee injury in July 2004. He tried to come back the following year but did not play professionally again.\nAs a minor leaguer, Howell batted .249 with 20 home runs and 290 runs batted in 1133 games."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 1985 London were the joint fifth world kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization arranged by British karate master Joe Johal – who had been made W.A.K.O. president earlier that year. The organization was facing some turmoil at the time with it splitting into two separate factions due to political differences which meant there were two separate world championships being held – with an event in Budapest that very same weekend. These political differences would, however, be resolved the following year and the organization would come back together. It was the second world championships to be held in the city of London and third overall (the Europeans had been held in 1980, the worlds in 1983).\nThe event was open to amateur men, and for the first time ever, women were allowed to compete (as they would in Budapest event also). The men had three categories, Full-Contact, Semi-Contact and the newly introduced Musical Forms (which had been unofficially part of the W.A.K.O. World Championships 1981). In contrast, the women had just the one category; Semi-Contact. Each country had one competitor per weight division in men's Full-Contact and Semi-Contact, although some competitors in the men's events competed in two different categories, while the women's Semi-Contact and men's Musical Forms categories were allowed more than one participant per country due to limited numbers. By the end of the championships, the top nation were West Germany, narrowly shading the USA by virtue of an extra silver, with host nation Great Britain behind in third. The event was held at the Wembley Centre in London, England, UK, on Saturday, 2 November 1985.\nMen's Full-Contact Kickboxing.\nIn the men's Full-Contact category there were ten weight classes ranging from 54 kg/118.8 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, with the two heaviest divisions being similar to the 1983 world championships and slightly heavier than the last Europeans. All bouts were fought under Full-Contact rules with more detail on the rules being provided at the W.A.K.O. website – although be aware that the rules may have changed slightly since 1985. Notable winners included regular winner Ferdinand Mack who moved up to the 75 kg division to win his sixth gold at a W.A.K.O. championships (world and European) and future boxing world champion Troy Dorsey who would also win gold at the same event in the Semi-Contact category. At the end of the championships West Germany was the comfortable leader in Full-Contact winning an impressive six golds, one silver and one bronze.\nSemi-Contact Kickboxing.\nSemi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fighters were won by points given due to technique, skill and speed, with physical force limited – more information on Semi-Contact can be found on the W.A.K.O. website, although the rules will have changed since 1985. There were also less divisions in men's Semi-Contact with slightly different weight classes ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs. The most notable winner was future boxing world champion Troy Dorsey who also won a gold medal in Full-Contact at the same event. The USA was the top nation in men's Semi-Contact winning four golds and two bronze medals. \nAlso, for the first time ever women were allowed to compete at a W.A.K.O. championships. The only category on offer was Semi-Contact with just four weight divisions ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 60 kg/132 lbs. Due to the somewhat smaller amount of nations competing some nations were allowed more than one competitor per weight division. By the end of the championships West Germany was the strongest nation in women's Semi-Contact beating off a spirited show by Scotland by winning two golds and one silver medal.\nMen's Musical Forms.\nMusical Forms made its first official appearance at a W.A.K.O. event (it had been held unofficially in Milan four years previously). Musical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques. Unlike the other categories on offer in London there were no weight classes. More information on Musical Forms can be accessed on the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules may have changed since 1985. Musical Forms in London was open to men only and by the end of the championships, there was only one recorded winner with the US's John Chung adding a gold to the unofficial one he won in Milan and his second at the London event (he won a bronze in the −69 kg Semi-Contact category as well)."

        "text": "The fosh, fosh ball, or fosh change is a seldom used pitch in Major League Baseball described as \"a cross between a split-fingered pitch and a straight change-up\". It is designed to fool a batter expecting a fastball to have to contend with a slower pitch. The pitch has a grip like a fastball, but the index and middle fingers are spread slightly across the baseball, and the ring and little finger wrap around the side of the ball. If thrown properly, it has characteristics like a breaking change-up or an off-speed split-finger fastball.\nThe origin of the fosh is unknown. Mike Boddicker was the first pitcher known to throw it, having tried it in the 1980s. As pitching coach for the Boston Red Sox, Al Nipper taught the pitch to Jeff Suppan in 1995, and Tom Gordon and Roger Clemens in 1996. Other pitchers who have used it in a game are Jason Frasor, Trevor Hoffman, Johan Santana, Jason Bere, Carl Pavano, and Carlos Rosa.\nThere are various etymologies for the term \"fosh\". According to \"The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching, Pitchers, and Pitches\", three derivations are known. One is that Earl Weaver described it as \"a cross between a fastball and a dead fish\". Another is a description by David Nied, who said the term sounds \"like the perfect word for the movement of the pitch\". A third derivation, from Al Nipper, is that fosh is an acronym for \"full of ...\"."

        "text": "Ronald Baxter Henry (August 7, 1936 – May 14, 2016) was an American professional baseball player. He was a catcher who spent one full season (1961) and part of another (1964) in Major League Baseball as a member of the Minnesota Twins. Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall, and weighed .\nHenry's career lasted for 15 seasons (1954–68). The first seven were spent in the farm system of the Milwaukee Braves. He was chosen in the 1960 Rule 5 draft after batting .310 for the Austin Senators of the Double-A Texas League, and spent the entire 1961 campaign with the Twins in their first season in the Twin Cities. He was the club's third-string catcher (behind Earl Battey and Hal Naragon) and played in only 20 games, 14 as a pinch hitter. Henry batted only .143 with four hits, then spent the next 2 seasons in the minor leagues until his recall to Minnesota in June 1964. With Battey, a five-time American League All-Star, still entrenched as the Twins' regular receiver, Henry's opportunities again were limited.

        "text": "Michael Edward Hutchinson (born March 2, 1990) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) while under contract to the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). Hutchinson was selected by the Boston Bruins in the third round, 77th overall, of the 2008 NHL Entry Draft.\nPlaying career.\nAmateur.\nHutchinson grew up playing minor hockey for the Barrie Icemen (now Jr. Colts) of the OMHA's Eastern AAA League. He was a member of the Ontario Blues summer hockey team that featured other notable graduates such as Steven Stamkos, John Tavares, Alex Pietrangelo, Michael Del Zotto, Stefan Della Rovere, Cody Hodgson and Cameron Gaunce. Hutchinson was selected in the third round, 69th overall, of the 2006 OHL Priority Selection by his hometown Barrie Colts. After three years in Barrie, Hutchinson was traded in the summer of 2009 to the London Knights, where he finished his junior career.\nProfessional.\nOn March 30, 2010, the Boston Bruins signed Hutchinson to a three-year, entry-level contract. Having split the 2010–11 season with the Bruins' minor league affiliates—the Providence Bruins of the American Hockey League (AHL) and the Reading Royals of the ECHL—on April 12, 2011, Hutchinson was recalled by Boston to the NHL. On March 3, 2012, just one day after his 22nd birthday, Hutchinson was recalled by Boston to serve as the team's back-up goaltender on the night due to an injury to starter Tuukka Rask.\nOn July 19, 2013, as a free agent, Hutchinson signed a one-year, two-way contract with the Winnipeg Jets. He was assigned to the Jets' secondary affiliate, the Ontario Reign of the ECHL to begin the 2013–14 season. Hutchinson posted 22–4–2 record with the Reign, earning a promotion to Winnipeg's AHL affiliate, the St. John's IceCaps. With the IceCaps' starting goaltender Edward Pasquale suffering season-ending injury, Hutchinson posted a 15–5 record before earning a recall to the Winnipeg Jets on March 15, 2014.\nOn April 7, 2014, Hutchinson made his NHL debut in a 1–0 loss to the Minnesota Wild. He played the final two games of the season with the Jets, claiming his first career NHL win with Winnipeg in a 2–1 shootout win over the Boston Bruins on April 10. He was returned to the IceCaps for the 2014 AHL playoffs, and was instrumental in helping St. John's reach the Calder Cup finals for the first time in franchise history. On July 2, 2014, the Jets signed Hutchinson to a two-year contract extension. Hutchinson played in the 2014–15 season in the NHL as the back-up to Jets starter Ondřej Pavelec. Hutchinson would finish the season with a 21–10–5 record.\nOn June 21, 2016, Hutchinson signed another two-year contract extension with the Jets.\nOn July 1, 2018, having left the Jets as a free agent after five seasons, Hutchinson signed a one-year, $1.3 million contract with the Florida Panthers. After attending the Panthers' 2018 training camp, Hutchinson was reassigned to begin the 2018–19 season with their AHL affiliate, the Springfield Thunderbirds. However, he was soon recalled to the Panthers after an injury to starting goaltender Roberto Luongo, and made his debut with Florida in a 5–4 overtime defeat to the Philadelphia Flyers on October 16, 2018. Hutchison collected his first and only win with the Panthers in relief in the following contest against the Washington Capitals on October 19, 2018. After four games with the Panthers, and following the return to health of Luongo, Hutchinson was reassigned to the Thunderbirds.\nHutchinson appeared in eight games with Springfield before being traded on December 29, 2018, to the Toronto Maple Leafs in exchange for a 2020 fifth-round draft pick. He was immediately reassigned to join Toronto's AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies. After being recalled to the NHL, on January 3, 2019, he made his debut with the Leafs in a 4–3 loss against the Minnesota Wild. On January 5, in his second game for the Leafs, he recorded his first victory in the Maple Leafs uniform, earning a shutout in a 5–0 win against the Vancouver Canucks.\nOn June 29, 2019, Hutchinson agreed to a one-year, one-way $700,000 contract extension to remain with the Maple Leafs. Assuming the backup duties for the Maple Leafs entering the 2019–20 season, Hutchinson was unable to solidify his role posting a 0–4–1 record through his first six games before he was re-assigned to AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, on November 12, 2019. He later returned to the Maple Leafs on November 29, 2019, and played sparingly in recording 4 wins through 15 games. On February 13, 2020, Hutchinson was placed on waivers by the Maple Leafs, eight days after the team had traded for backup goaltender Jack Campbell. He cleared waivers the next day and was loaned to the Toronto Marlies.\nOn February 24, 2020, Hutchinson was traded by the Maple Leafs to the Colorado Avalanche in exchange for Calle Rosén. Remaining with the Avalanche to cover for injured goaltender Philipp Grubauer, he served as the backup to Pavel Francouz. On March 2 (his 30th birthday), Hutchinson recorded his first win with the team, making 17 saves in a 2-1 win over the Detroit Red Wings. With the season soon halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Hutchinson later returned to the team as the club's third choice goaltender in the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nFollowing injuries to both Grubauer and Francouz, Hutchinson made his playoff debut during the second round in relief of Francouz, making three saves during a 5-4 defeat to the Dallas Stars on August 30, 2020. Entering Game 5, with the Avalanche down 3-1 in the series, Hutchinson made his first start to record 31 saves in posting his first-career postseason victory on August 31, 2020. He became just the seventh goaltender in NHL history to win his first two starts while facing elimination in Game 6, helping the Avalanche level the series 3-3 after a 4-1 victory on September 2, 2020. He was unable to help advance the Avalanche to the conference finals, suffering a 5-4 overtime defeat in his fourth career post-season appearance on September 4, 2020.\nAs a free agent at the conclusion of his contract with the Avalanche, Hutchinson opted to return to the Maple Leafs, securing a two-year, two-way contract on October 30, 2020.\nOn July 13, 2022, Hutchinson continued his journeyman career in the NHL, agreeing to a one-year, two-way contract with the Vegas Golden Knights. In the following 2022–23 season, Hutchinson was re-assigned to add depth to the Golden Knights AHL affiliate, the Henderson Silver Knights. He collected just 1 win through 7 games with the Silver Knights and was recalled to the Golden Knights on multiple occasions without making his debut with the club. On March 2, 2023, the Golden Knights traded Hutchinson to the Columbus Blue Jackets and a seventh-round pick in 2025, in exchange for Jonathan Quick. Hutchinson made 16 appearances with the cellar dwelling Blue Jackets, posting 2 wins to play out the regular season.\nAs a free agent from the Blue Jackets, Hutchinson went un-signed over the summer. He later signed a professional tryout (PTO) with the Detroit Red Wings by accepting an invitation to their training camp in preparation for the season. Hutchinson was later released from his tryout with the Red Wings and signed a PTO with AHL affiliate, the Grand Rapids Griffins, on October 6, 2023. On December 19, 2023, the Red Wings signed Hutchinson to a one-year, two-way contract for the remainder of the 2023–24 season. After injuries to starting goaltenders Ville Husso and Alex Lyon, Hutchinson made his debut for the Red Wings on December 23, 2023. "

        "text": "The 2012 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2011–12 season. It began on April 11, 2012, after the conclusion of the regular season, and ended on June 11, with the Los Angeles Kings defeating the New Jersey Devils in six games in the Stanley Cup Finals to win their first Stanley Cup championship. Kings goaltender Jonathan Quick, having recorded a 1.41 goals against average, was named the Conn Smythe Trophy winner as the playoffs' most valuable player.\nThe Vancouver Canucks made the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners for the second consecutive year with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Detroit Red Wings increased their postseason appearance streak to twenty-one seasons, the longest active streak at the time. The Florida Panthers returned to the postseason to end a record-breaking 10-season drought from the playoffs that began with the 2000 Stanley Cup playoffs. This was also the first time that the Buffalo Sabres missed the playoffs during their active playoff appearance drought; they surpassed Edmonton and Florida's shared record for longest playoff appearance drought in league history by missing the playoffs in 2022. This was the first year since 1996 in which no Canadian-based teams advanced past the first round. It marked the first time since 2004 in which none of the previous year's conference finalists (Boston Bruins, Vancouver, Tampa Bay Lightning, and San Jose Sharks) advanced past the opening round. This was the only playoffs where the Phoenix Coyotes reached the Conference Finals.\nAfter clinching a postseason spot in their 81st game of the regular season, the Kings became the first eighth-seeded team to win the Stanley Cup in NHL history (and the second eighth seed to reach the Cup Finals after the 2005–06 Edmonton Oilers). Their postseason began with an elimination of the Vancouver Canucks, who became the third Presidents' Trophy-winning team in the last four seasons to be eliminated in the opening round. Los Angeles went on to become the second team to eliminate the first, second, and third seeds from the playoffs in the same postseason after the 2003–04 Calgary Flames (and the first team to do so in that order). In addition, the Kings became the first team to make the Finals undefeated on the road (with their 8–0 record). As the sixth seed in their conference, the Devils were the lowest-seeded team to have home-ice advantage in the Stanley Cup Finals, breaking a record they set when they won the Cup as a fourth seed in 2000.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThe top eight teams in each conference qualified for the playoffs. The top three seeds in each conference were awarded to the division winners; while the five remaining spots were awarded to the highest finishers in their respective conferences.\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, the highest remaining seed in each conference was matched against the lowest remaining seed. The higher-seeded team was awarded home ice advantage. In the Stanley Cup Finals, home ice was awarded to the team with the better regular season record. Each best-of-seven series followed a 2–2–1–1–1 format: the higher-seeded team played at home for games one and two (plus five and seven if necessary), and the lower-seeded team was at home for games three and four (and if necessary, game six).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nConference quarterfinals.\nThe conference quarterfinals featured an NHL-record 16 overtime games.\nOne of the other major headlines during the conference quarterfinals were the number of suspensions and fines handed by the league. However, several players, coaches and writers complained about the lack of consistency that Brendan Shanahan, the NHL's Vice President of Player Safety and Hockey Operations, was handing out these fines and suspensions. \"(for each specific fine or suspension, see each series summary below)\"\nEastern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (8) Ottawa Senators.\nThe New York Rangers entered the playoffs as the first overall seed in the Eastern Conference with 109 points. The Ottawa Senators earned 92 points during the regular season, losing the tiebreaker to Washington in regulation + overtime wins (38 to 35) to finish eighth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the first playoff series between these two teams. Ottawa won three of the games in the season's four-game regular season series.\nThe first few games of the series were overshadowed by rough play and suspensions on both sides. In the first game, Rangers' checking center Brian Boyle punched defenceman Erik Karlsson but was not penalized. Senators' head coach Paul MacLean responded by adding enforcers Zenon Konopka and Matt Carkner for game two. Konopka harried Boyle as he conducted a live TV interview during the pre-game warm-ups, earning himself and his club fines. Carkner attacked Boyle at the beginning of the game and continued punching after Boyle fell to the ice. Boyle never dropped his gloves and Carkner was given a five-minute major and game misconduct. The Rangers' Brandon Dubinsky was also ejected as the third man in on the altercation; he threw a Gatorade cooler as he exited. Carkner received a one-game suspension for fighting an unwilling player. In an unrelated incident in that same game, New York's rookie skater Carl Hagelin elbowed Ottawa's captain Daniel Alfredsson in the head. Hagelin was given a five-minute major penalty and Alfredsson left the game and did not return. Hagelin was suspended for three games prompting a question of consistency by the New York Rangers. Alfredsson missed three games due to a concussion from the incident.\nNew York had a 4–2 victory in game one, but Ottawa's Chris Neil scored 1:17 into overtime of game two to tie the series at 1–1. In game three, Boyle scored the lone goal in the Rangers' 1–0 win. The Senators then overcame a two-goal deficit in game four to even the series yet again with Kyle Turris' goal 2:42 into overtime. Ottawa goaltender Craig Anderson stopped all 41 shots in a 2–0 victory on the road in game five, giving the Senators their first lead in the series. New York scored three goals in the second period in their 3–2 victory in game six and then held on to a 2–1 win in game seven to take the series.\n(2) Boston Bruins vs. (7) Washington Capitals.\nThe Boston Bruins, the defending 2011 Stanley Cup champions, entered the playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference by winning the Northeast Division with 102 points. The Washington Capitals earned 92 points during the regular season, winning the tiebreaker over Ottawa in regulation + overtime wins (38 to 35) to finish seventh overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the third playoff series between these two teams, with each team having won one of the previous playoff series. The most recent series between these teams was the 1998 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which was won by Washington in six games. Washington won three of the games in this year's four-game regular season series.\nThis was the first ever playoff series in NHL history in which all seven games were decided by only one goal. In addition, four of these games were decided in overtime. Rookie Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby, who started in place of injured regulars Tomas Vokoun and Michal Neuvirth, allowed only two goals in the first two games, matching his Bruins counterpart Tim Thomas. Thomas recorded a shutout in Boston's 1–0 overtime victory in game one. In game two, the Capitals battled back with a double overtime thriller when forward Nicklas Backstrom scored early in the second overtime period. The Bruins' 4–3 win in game three was followed by Backstrom getting suspended for one game after his post-game cross-check on Bruins forward Rich Peverley. Even without Backstrom, the Capitals evened the series with a 2–1 victory in game four. Washington's Troy Brouwer then scored the winning goal on a power play with 1:27 left in regulation of game five. Boston, facing elimination, went to Washington and managed to extend the series with Tyler Seguin's goal in overtime of game six. Game seven started with Washington forward Matt Hendricks deflecting the puck past Thomas. The Bruins answered with a shot that snuck behind Holtby and Tyler Seguin finding the puck and putting it in, but Washington's Joel Ward scored in overtime to give Washington a 2–1 victory in game seven and eliminate the defending Stanley Cup champion Bruins. With Washington's victory in the series, Holtby became just the third rookie goaltender in NHL history to defeat the reigning Stanley Cup champions.\n(3) Florida Panthers vs. (6) New Jersey Devils.\nThe Florida Panthers entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Eastern Conference by winning the Southeast Division with 94 points. The New Jersey Devils earned 102 points during the regular season to finish sixth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the second playoff series between these two teams, with New Jersey having swept the 2000 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, the last time the Panthers qualified for the playoffs. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nIn the first two games of the series, the winner scored the first three goals. In game one, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur won his 100th career playoff game, only the second netminder after Patrick Roy to do so, as New Jersey won 3–2. The Panthers' 4–2 win in game two was their first playoff win since April 17, 1997, and ended a streak of nine straight defeats in a 15-year span. game three saw both starting goaltenders pulled from the game. Florida's Jose Theodore surrendered three goals in the first period before being replaced by Scott Clemmensen, appearing in only his second playoff game. Brodeur was then pulled after the Panthers rallied to tie the game in the second period en route to 4–3 win. This was the first time since game one of the 2006 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Carolina Hurricanes that Brodeur was pulled in a postseason game, which coincidentally marked Clemmensen's playoff debut. Brodeur bounced back in game four and broke another one of Roy's records with his 24th career playoff shutout, as the Devils beat the Panthers, 4–0. But Theodore responded with his second career postseason shutout, as the Panthers took a 3–2 series lead with a 3–0 victory in game five. The Devils then tied the series with Travis Zajac's winning goal 5:39 into the overtime of game six. New Jersey's Adam Henrique then scored two goals in game seven, including the series-winning goal 3:47 into double overtime, to defeat Florida, 3–2.\n(4) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (5) Philadelphia Flyers.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the Eastern Conference with 108 points. The Philadelphia Flyers earned 103 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Eastern Conference. This was the sixth playoff series between these two teams, with Philadelphia having won three of the five previous playoff series. In the most recent matchup in the 2009 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, the Penguins defeated the Flyers in six games. Philadelphia won four of the games in this year's six-game regular season series. The Penguins entered the series as the favourites, with many hockey commentators predicting them to be the Stanley Cup champions.\nHowever, the Flyers won the first three games of the series en route to eliminating the Penguins in six games. Pittsburgh struggled defensively, giving up eight goals in each of games two and three. The Penguins did however score 10 goals in their game four win, becoming the first team to do so in a playoff game since the Los Angeles Kings scored 12 in the 1990 Smythe Division semifinals against the Calgary Flames. The Flyers' goaltending flaws resurfaced in that game, with neither Ilya Bryzgalov nor Sergei Bobrovsky able to stop the Penguins' torrid shooting. Again facing elimination, Pittsburgh went on to win game five, 3–2, in the lowest scoring game of the series. But Philadelphia rebounded to eliminate Pittsburgh in game six by the score of 5–1.\nGame three was overshadowed by a flurry of penalties drawn between the two teams, reminiscent of their penultimate regular season meeting on April 1. Three Penguins players drew suspensions. Arron Asham was suspended four games for a cross-check on Brayden Schenn, Craig Adams was suspended one game for instigating a fight, and James Neal was suspended one game for charging Claude Giroux. Penguins head coach Dan Bylsma was fined $10,000 because of Adams' instigator penalty in the final five minutes of the game.\nThe 45 goals scored through the first four games set an NHL record for goals in the first four games of a best-of-seven series. A total of 56 goals were scored over the course of the entire series, the highest total in any playoff series since 1995. \nWestern Conference quarterfinals.\n(1) Vancouver Canucks vs. (8) Los Angeles Kings.\nThe Vancouver Canucks entered the playoffs as the Western Conference regular season champions and Presidents' Trophy winners, earning 111 points. The Los Angeles Kings qualified for the postseason as the eighth seed with 95 points. This was the fifth playoff series between these two teams, the two teams each having won two of the previous playoff series. The most recent matchup occurred in the 2010 Western Conference quarterfinals, where the Canucks defeated the Kings in six games. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series. The Canucks entered the series as the favourites, with many hockey commentators predicting them to be the Western Conference champions.\nHowever, the Kings won the first three games of the series en route to eliminating the Canucks in five games. In doing so, Los Angeles became the third California team, and the sixth team overall, to eliminate a Presidents' Trophy winner in the first round of the playoffs. Vancouver struggled offensively throughout the series, while Los Angeles goaltender Jonathan Quick only allowed eight total goals, including a shutout in game three. The Canucks' Byron Bitz was suspended for two games after boarding the Kings' Kyle Clifford in game one. Cory Schneider then replaced Roberto Luongo as Vancouver's starting goaltender for game three, prompting speculation that Luongo might be traded after the season. Game four saw the return of Vancouver's Daniel Sedin, in his first appearance since suffering a concussion on March 21. He had an assist in the Canucks' 3–1 victory in game four, and the team avoided becoming the first Presidents' Trophy winner to be swept in a conference quarterfinal series. However, Jarret Stoll ended the Canucks season, scoring at 4:27 of overtime to give the Kings a 2–1 victory in game five, the only overtime game of the series. They moved on to the second round for the first time since 2001.\n(2) St. Louis Blues vs. (7) San Jose Sharks.\nThe St. Louis Blues entered the playoffs as the Central Division champions, earning 109 points. The San Jose Sharks qualified for the postseason as the seventh seed with 96 points. This was the fourth playoff series between these two teams, with San Jose having won two of the three previous playoff series. The most recent matchup occurred in the 2004 Western Conference quarterfinals, where the Sharks defeated the Blues in five games. St. Louis swept this year's four-game regular season series, outscoring San Jose by a combined score of 11–3. A large part of the Blues' success was the play of their goaltenders Jaroslav Halak and Brian Elliott, who both allowed a league low of 165 combined team goals, earning them the William M. Jennings Trophy.\nThe Blues began the playoffs with Halak on goal, partly based on his playoff experience playing for the Montreal Canadiens. The Sharks took game one off of Martin Havlat's goal in double overtime. Halak then suffered a lower-body injury early into game two, but Elliott picked up where Halak left off in a Blues' 3–0 shutout, and subsequently allowed only five San Jose goals in St. Louis' victories in games three, four, and five to capture the series.\n(3) Phoenix Coyotes vs. (6) Chicago Blackhawks.\nThe Phoenix Coyotes entered the playoffs as the third seed in the Western Conference by winning the Pacific Division with 97 points. The Chicago Blackhawks earned 101 points during the regular season to finish sixth overall in the Western Conference. This was the first playoff series between these two teams. Phoenix won three of the games in this year's four-game regular season series.\nThis became only the second playoff series in NHL history in which the first five games went into overtime, the first being the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens. Games one and two both saw the Blackhawks score the tying goal with less than 15 seconds left in regulation. In game two, Chicago's Andrew Shaw was ejected and later suspended for three games, after hitting Phoenix goaltender Mike Smith in the head. Smith laid on the ice for five minutes but remained in that game. Then in game three, the Coyotes' Raffi Torres hit the Blackhawks' Marian Hossa in the open ice. Hossa was carted out on a stretcher. Torres left his feet, Hossa did not have the puck when Torres hit him, and Torres did not receive a penalty during the game, Torres was later suspended for 25 games and next season's preseason games. The hit violated three rules: interference, charging, and hit to the head. Coyotes forward Mikkel Boedker scored the overtime winning goal in both Game three and four, giving the Coyotes a 3–1 series lead, though Chicago was able to stave off elimination in Game five with a 2–1 overtime win, making it five consecutive games that the two teams required overtime. Game six ended up being one-sided as Smith shutout the Blackhawks, 4–0, and the Coyotes won their first playoff series since moving from Winnipeg to Phoenix in 1996, and the first one in franchise history since 1987.\n(4) Nashville Predators vs. (5) Detroit Red Wings.\nThe Nashville Predators entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the Western Conference with 104 points. The Detroit Red Wings earned 102 points during the regular season to finish fifth overall in the Western Conference. This was the third playoff series between these two teams, with Detroit having won both of the previous playoff series in six games, and the most recent matchup occurring in the 2008 Western Conference quarterfinals. The teams split this year's six-game regular season series.\nThe Predators defeated the Red Wings in five games, with four of them each being decided by only one goal. In the final seconds of game one, Nashville captain Shea Weber slammed Detroit's Henrik Zetterberg's head into the glass, cracking Zetterberg's helmet. Weber was later fined $2,500 for the action with no suspension or further disciplinary action. Although the Red Wings had the most home wins in the league during the regular season (with an overall home record of 31–7–3), the Predators won both games three and four on the road, Nashville's first-ever playoff victories at Joe Louis Arena.\nConference semifinals.\nEastern Conference semifinals.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (7) Washington Capitals.\nThis was the seventh playoff series between the Rangers and the Capitals, with Washington having won four of the previous six playoff series. This also was the third series between these two teams in the last four seasons, with the previous two series occurring in the 2009 and 2011 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which Washington won 4–3 and 4–1, respectively. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nNew York eliminated Washington in seven games. In game one, the Rangers scored two goals within 1:30 in the third period to take a 3–1 victory. The Capitals then took game two, 3–2, after Alexander Ovechkin scored the game-winning power-play goal with 7:27 left in the third period. Game three then ended at 14:41 of the third overtime with Marian Gaborik's goal to give New York a 2–1 win. This game was the 20th longest overtime game in NHL playoff history, the first 3OT game for the Rangers since 1971, and the longest overtime game in Rangers franchise history since 1939. New York also snapped a streak of seven consecutive playoff overtime losses, their last playoff overtime win coming in 2007. For Washington, it was the third-longest game in franchise history.\nWashington evened the series in game four with Mike Green's power play goal with 5:48 remaining to give the Capitals a 2–1 win. In game five, with Washington leading 2–1 with 21.3 seconds remaining, Capitals forward Joel Ward took a double-minor penalty for high-sticking Rangers forward Carl Hagelin, and on the ensuing power play New York forward Brad Richards scored the game-tying goal with 6.6 seconds left in regulation, the latest game-tying playoff goal in Rangers franchise history. The Rangers remained on the power play to start the overtime period, with Ward serving the second half of his double-minor, and Rangers defenceman Marc Staal scored the game-winning goal at 1:35 of OT, completing the comeback. Washington rebounded in game six, winning 2–1 as goaltender Braden Holtby made 30 saves to force game seven. Brad Richards scored 1:32 into the first period to give the Rangers an early 1–0 lead game seven, then Michael Del Zotto scored in the third period to make it 2–0. Washington's Roman Hamrlik cut the score to 2–1 shortly after Del Zotto's goal, but the Capitals were unable to score another goal and lost the series. Through their first 14 games of the playoffs, the Rangers did not allow more than three goals in any of the games, setting an NHL record.\n(5) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (6) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the fifth playoff series between these two teams, with each team having won two of the previous four playoff series. The most recent matchup occurred in the 2010 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, where the Flyers defeated the Devils in five games. The Atlantic division rivals split this year's six-game regular season series.\nThe Devils defeated the Flyers in five games. In each game of the series, the team that scored first ended up losing. Daniel Briere scored 4:36 into overtime of game one to give Philadelphia its lone victory of the series by the score of 4–3. New Jersey then scored four third-period goals in a 4–1 victory in game two. Alexei Ponikarovsky's goal 17:21 into overtime defeated the Flyers, 4–3, in game three. Then in game four, the Devils scored four unanswered goals to overcome a 2–0 deficit to win, 4–2. And finally in game five, New Jersey scored two first-period goals 3:18 apart en route to a 3–1 victory to win the series.\nWestern Conference semifinals.\n(2) St. Louis Blues vs. (8) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the third playoff series between these two teams, with St. Louis having swept Los Angeles out of both of the previous playoff series; the most recent matchup was in the 1998 Western Conference quarterfinals. Los Angeles won three of the games in this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Kings swept the Blues to advance to the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993. Los Angeles scored 15 total goals in the series, while goaltender Jonathan Quick only allowed six total St. Louis goals. This series marked the first time in Kings history that they swept a seven-game series, and the first time in NHL history the eighth seed defeated both the first and the second seeds. This was the only sweep of the entire playoffs.\n(3) Phoenix Coyotes vs. (4) Nashville Predators.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two teams. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Coyotes defeated the Predators in five games to advance to their first ever conference finals in team history. This also marked the first time that Phoenix jumped to a 2–0 series lead since 1987. Ray Whitney scored the overtime winner in the Coyotes' 4–3 victory in game one. In game two, four different Phoenix players each had a goal and an assist in their 5–3 win. The Predators bounced back in game three, with goaltender Pekka Rinne stopping all 32 shots in a 2–0 victory. Coyotes goaltender Mike Smith responded with a shutout of his own in game four, stopping 25 shots, while Shane Doan scoring the lone goal in a 1–0 Phoenix win. Smith then continued to hold Nashville scoreless until 14:01 of the third period of game five, and the Coyotes held on to a 2–1 victory to win the series. Nashville was without forwards Alexander Radulov and Andrei Kostitsyn for games three and four, as the team suspended both players for breaking team curfew prior to game three. This marked the last time that the Coyotes won a playoff series until 2020, when they defeated Nashville in the qualifying round.\nConference finals.\nEastern Conference final.\n(1) New York Rangers vs. (6) New Jersey Devils.\nThis was the sixth playoff series between these two teams, with New Jersey's only win coming from a sweep of the Rangers in the 2006 Eastern Conference quarterfinals. The Devils and the Rangers last met in the 2008 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which the Rangers won in five games. The teams split this year's six-game regular season series. In 1994, the Rangers and the Devils also met in the Eastern Conference Final, with New York prevailing in seven games, en route to winning the 1994 Stanley Cup. The Devils reached the conference finals for the first time since beating the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 2003 Stanley Cup Finals, while the Rangers reached the conference finals for the first time since 1997, when they lost to rival Philadelphia Flyers.\nThe Rangers scored three unanswered goals in the third period, and goaltender Henrik Lundqvist stopped all 21 New Jersey shots, to take game one, 3–0. In game two, David Clarkson's score early in the third period broke a 2–2 tie to give the Devils a 3–2 victory. Game three then ended up being similar to game one, as New York scored another three unanswered goals in the third period, and Lundqvist stopped all 37 New Jersey shots, en route to a second 3–0 win in this series. With his fifth goal of the playoffs in game three, Rangers rookie forward Chris Kreider set an NHL record for goals and points (5 goals, 7 points) for a player in the playoffs before his first regular season game.\nNew Jersey then took game four, 4–1, as Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur made 28 saves and Zach Parise scored two goals. Game five ended up being a wild contest, as New Jersey scored three unanswered goals in the first period before New York tied it up early in the third period. Ryan Carter then scored at 15:36 of the third period, and Zach Parise added an empty-net goal, to give the Devils the 5–3 win. Adam Henrique's goal at 1:03 of overtime of game six then gave New Jersey a 3–2 victory to win the series. The Devils' did not win another playoff series until 2023 when they defeated their rivals the New York Rangers in seven games. \nWestern Conference final.\n(3) Phoenix Coyotes vs. (8) Los Angeles Kings.\nThis was the first playoff series between these two franchises (including when the Coyotes were in Winnipeg). Each team won three games in this year's six-game regular season series. The Kings reached the conference finals for the first time since losing in the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals to the Montreal Canadiens, while this marked the first Conference finals appearance for the Phoenix Coyotes franchise, which made it past the first round of the playoffs for the first time since 1987. Since the NBA's Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers made it to the playoffs, game four of the series had to be played on the same day as game four of the Los Angeles Clippers and San Antonio Spurs series.\nThe Kings defeated the Coyotes in five games, advancing to their first Cup Finals since 1993. Los Angeles out-shot Phoenix in game one, 48–27, en route to a 4–2 win. The Kings then shut the Coyotes out in game two, 4–0, as goaltender Jonathan Quick made 24 saves and Jeff Carter scored a hat trick. Los Angeles then overcame an early 1–0 deficit to take game three, 2–1. However, Shane Doan scored Phoenix's only two goals, and goaltender Mike Smith stopped all 36 shots, to give the Coyotes a 2–0 victory in game four to extend the series. But Dustin Penner's goal at 17:42 of overtime of game five gave the Kings a 4–3 victory to win the series. The game five win extended the Kings' road playoff winning streak to ten games, eight of which came this season, both setting NHL playoff records. The Kings became only the second team to eliminate the top three seeds from the same postseason, after the 2003–04 Calgary Flames, and the second eighth-seeded to reach the Stanley Cup Finals after the 2005–06 Edmonton Oilers. Game Five was the last Stanley Cup playoff game to be held at Jobing.com Arena.\nStanley Cup Finals.\nThis was the first playoff series between the Kings and the Devils. The Devils defeated the Kings in both games in this year's two-game regular season series. This was New Jersey's fifth appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals, and their first since the Cup win over Los Angeles's rival Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in seven games. This was Los Angeles's second Finals appearance; their only other appearance was a five-game Stanley Cup Finals loss to the Montreal Canadiens in . The combined seeds of the teams, 14, is the highest ever for the Stanley Cup Finals. On June 11, 2012, the Kings defeated the Devils in six games and won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The Kings became the first and to date, only eighth-seeded team in North American sports history to win a championship.\nBy winning the first two games on the road in Newark, New Jersey, the Los Angeles Kings set the single-season consecutive playoff road winning record at ten. They also improved the record to twelve consecutive road wins going back to the 2011 NHL playoffs when they beat the San Jose Sharks the last two games played in San Jose.\nPlayer statistics.\nSkaters.\nThese are the top ten skaters based on points.

The tournament doubled as the qualification to the 2012 Summer Olympics to be held in London, Great Britain.\nThe United States won the tournament after defeating Argentina 4–2 in the final, obtaining their first title and ending Argentina's streak of six consecutive titles since the women's tournament was included in the Pan American Games in 1987.\nQualification.\nEvery country in the Pan American Hockey Federation had the opportunity to qualify through a regional tournament except the two North American countries as they did not participate in them. Taking that into consideration, it was decided to allow two teams not already qualified through regional tournaments to qualify for the Pan American Games based on final rankings in the 2009 Pan American Cup. Along with the automatically qualified host nation, the eighth participating country was decided in a three test-match series between Cuba (who did not participate in the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games) and Jamaica (who would have qualified in the third qualifying position from the 2009 Pan American Cup)\nCompetition format.\nEight teams competed in both the men's and women's Pan American Games hockey tournaments with the competition consisting of two rounds.\nIn the first round, teams were divided into two pools of four teams, and play followed round robin format with each of the teams playing all other teams in the pool once. Teams were awarded three points for a win, one point for a draw and zero points for a loss.\nFollowing the completion of the pool games, teams placing first and second in each pool advanced to a single elimination round consisting of two semifinal games, and the bronze and gold medal games. Remaining teams competed in classification matches to determine their ranking in the tournament. During these matches, extra time of 7½ minutes per half was played if teams were tied at the end of regulation time. During extra time, play followed golden goal rules with the first team to score declared the winner. If no goals were scored during extra time, a penalty stroke competition took place.\nUmpires.\nBelow are the 12 umpires appointed by the Pan American Hockey Federation:\nResults.\n\"All times are Central Daylight Time ()\"\nFirst round.\nPool A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPool B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "title": "1965–66 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 1965–66 Ashes series consisted of five cricket Test matches, each of five days with six hours play and eight ball overs. It formed part of the MCC tour of Australia in 1965–66 and the matches outside the Tests were played in the name of the Marylebone Cricket Club. M.J.K. Smith led the England team with the intent on\nregaining the Ashes lost in the 1958–59 Ashes series, but the series was drawn 1-1 and they were retained by Australia. The Australian team was captained by Bobby Simpson in three Tests, and his vice-captain Brian Booth in two Tests.\nIt was the first tour of Australia by players instead of amateurs and professionals and the first time that the MCC travelled to Australia by air instead of by sea. Although the press labelled the England team as the weakest to go to Australia, their entertaining cricket won them favour with the crowds. They also made their runs faster than any other England team since the war and for once England batted faster than Australia, a refreshing contrast to other Ashes series of the era.\nWith both sides having good batsmen and weak bowling attacks an exceptional number of runs were made, especially by Australia in the last two Tests when they fielded seven specialist batsmen and an all rounder. A record eleven batsmen averaged over 40 in the series and the teams exceeded 500 in an innings three times between them, 400 another four times and England made their highest score in Australia since 1928–29. \"The long and short of it was that the batting of both sides was much stronger than the bowling\".\nIn the Third Test at Sydney England's Bob Barber and Geoff Boycott added 234 for the first wicket in 242 minutes, the highest opening partnership by England in Australia since Jack Hobbs and Herbert Sutcliffe made 283 at Melbourne in 1924–25, resulting in Australia's defeat by an innings and 93 runs, their worst result at home since 1911–12. In the Fourth Test at Adelaide Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry added 244 in 255 minutes, the highest opening stand by Australia in an Ashes Test at the time, and still their highest opening stand against England in Australia. They won by an innings and 9 runs to even the series, only the third time that two teams had defeated each other by an innings in successive Tests.\nLawry \"always seemed to be batting\", his 592 runs (84.57) were the most in an Ashes series since Don Bradman in 1946–47 and his three centuries the most since Arthur Morris in 1948. Bob Cowper retained the Ashes for Australia with his 307 in 727 minutes in the Fifth Test at Melbourne, the first Test triple century in Australia, the longest Test innings in Australia and the highest Ashes century in Australia. The series also saw the debut of the Australians Doug Walters, who made a century on debut, Keith Stackpole and Peter Allan and the final Tests of Wally Grout, Brian Booth, Peter Burge and David Sincock.\nFirst Test – Brisbane.\n\"Australia had substantially the better of it, Walters adding his name to the fairly select list of those who have made a hundred in their first Test...After Walters's innings I wrote that with one necessary qualification I thought he would be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48. The reservation concerned his ability against really fast bowling, as to which I had no evidence...Only Lawry and Simpson have made more runs and had record to compare if one is to make a quantitative judgement. Any all events my contention is at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia , some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings I never saw it.\"\nPreliminaries.\nAlthough the wicket at the Gabba usually favours fast bowlers both teams used a leg spinner and two off-spinners in the match, Bob Barber, Fred Titmus and Dave Allen for England and Peter Philpott, Tom Veivers and Bob Cowper for Australia. Vice-captain Brian Booth took command as Bobby Simpson had broken his wrist, and elected to bat after winning the toss. The 19-year-old Doug Walters was called up for his Test debut after having made 129 for New South Wales against the tourists and so was the fast bowler Peter Allan on his home ground. Bill Lawry's Victorian teammate Ian Redpath was brought in to open instead of Simpson. The veteran batsman Peter Burge ensured his place with innings of 52, 50, 114 not out and 60 against the MCC. The tourists had had the best run of games of any MCC team since the war, beating Western Australia, South Australia and New South Wales, drawing with Queensland, when they needed two more wickets to win, and losing to Victoria by 32 runs after a run-chase. As a result, the bookies reduced the odds of their winning the Ashes from 7/2 to evens. The England vice-captain Colin Cowdrey was unable to play and was replaced by the in form Scottish opener Eric Russell.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nPersistent rain ruined the first two days with less than three hours play on the first day and none on the second. England thought their wicket-keeper Jim Parks caught Bill Lawry off Dave Brown (3/71) with his seventh ball, but were turned down by Umpire Egar. This was the first and last umpiring dispute of the series as Egar and Lou Rowan soon established their credentials. Lawry – \"England's scourge of the sixties\" – stayed put until the afternoon of the third day making 166. He added 187 with Doug Walters who hit 155 with 11 fours and 2 sixes to become the 10th Australian to make a century on his Ashes debut, and aged 19 years and 357 days the third youngest after Archie Jackson and Neil Harvey. The off-spinner Tom Veivers made 56 not out and Booth declared on 443/6 early on the fourth day, leaving him 11 hours to bowl England out twice if he could enforce the follow on.\nEngland – First Innings.\nEngland made steady progress, Bob Barber was out for 5, but the young batsmen Geoff Boycott (45) and John Edrich (32) batted for 108 minutes adding 70 runs for the second wicket before the leg-spinner Peter Philpott removed them both. The stonewaller Ken Barrington dug himself in for over three hours making 53 while first Jim Parks (52) and Fred Titmus (60) attacked the bowling at the other end. Parks hit 4 fours and 3 sixes and Titmus 6 fours and Barrington asked them to slow down as they were making him look foolish. They both fell to Philpott, as did Brown to give the Australian 5/90, his only five-wicket haul in Tests. The last five wickets fell for 59 runs and Eric Russell, who had injured his hand, came in last and batted out an unbeaten duck in his only Test of the series. Though England made 280 – 183 runs behind – Booth could enforce the follow on due to the truncated play on the first two days.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nAustralia had less than three and a half hours to bowl England out for victory and their spinners gave them 50 overs to do so. Bob Barber hit 34 off 37 balls with 3 fours and a six, but Geoff Boycott carried his bat through to stumps with 63 not out. Boycott pushed a ball from Peter Philpott away with his hand during his innings, but Brian Booth refused to appeal for handled the ball and Wally Grout just told him not to do it again. John Edrich (37) and Ken Barrington (38) also hit sixes and Mike Smith saw out the last half-hour as England made 186/3 to ensure a draw.\nResult.\nThanks to nine hours of rain Australia and England drew the Test to go into the Second Test with the series tied 0–0, though the hosts felt that they had the moral advantage.\nSecond Test – Melbourne.\n\"England's reply began with an 'electrifying' 88 in an hour by Boycott and Barber – what a pity that circumstances prevented this glamorous partnership from regularly plaguing England's opponents once this tour was over! From this beginning all those following took profit, so that England, for the first time in Australia since the Bodyline tour thirty-odd years before, topped 500.\"\nPreliminaries.\nThe Australian captain Bobby Simpson and England vice-captain Colin Cowdrey were fit again and rejoined their respective teams. Ian Redpath was dropped due to his captain's return, as were Neil Hawke in favour of the fast bowler Garth McKenzie and Peter Allan for the fast-medium bowler Alan Connolly. The batsman Eric Russell and fast bowler Dave Brown were suffering from injuries and Ken Higgs had a chill. The Welsh left-arm fast bowler Jeff Jones was called up, as was the Essex all rounder Barry Knight flown out as a replacement just before the First Test. Simpson won the toss and batted on a good wicket.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nBobby Simpson (59), Bill Lawry (88 in almost four and a half hours) and Bob Cowper (99) reached 278/4 by the end of the first day despite the best efforts of Jeff Jones (3/92). The next morning they collapsed to 358 all out with Barry Knight (4/84) taking four of the last five wickets and Tom Veivers being run out.\nEngland – First Innings.\nBob Barber (48) was determined to attack the Australian bowling from the get go, but was outpaced by Geoff Boycott (51) as they made 88 in an hour and 98 for the first wicket. John Edrich (109), Ken Barrington (64), Colin Cowdrey (104), Mike Smith (41), Jim Parks (71) and Fred Titmus (56 not out) piled up 558 as England made their biggest total down under since their 636 in the Second Test in 1928–29. Titmus was hit on the back of the head by a bouncer from Alan Connolly, but continued to play and hit three quick boundaries. They batted the into the fourth day and the long suffering Garth McKenzie took 5/134 off 35.2 eight-ball overs, which if nothing else confirmed his reputation of taking wickets on good batting tracks.\nAustralia – Second innings.\nBobby Simpson (67) and Bill Lawry (78) added 120 for the first wicket and helped by poor light ending play two hours early Australia were 131/1 going into the last day. They had reached 204/4 when Jim Parks missed a stumping chance off Peter Burge when Australia were only four runs ahead. Burge made 120, his fourth and final Test century, all made against England in times of crisis, and Doug Walters 115 in his second Test. Mike Smith had given up hope when the part-time bowler Geoff Boycott (2/32) had Burge out after a stand of 198 and with Ken Barrington (2/47) surprisingly cleared up the tail to have Australia out for 426.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nEngland needed to make 227 runs in less than half an hour and the match was called off after Boycott had made 5 not out.\nResult.\nThanks to some poor weather and some resolute Australian batting on the last day the Test was a draw, leaving the teams 0–0. Even though the first two Tests had been drawn the press were optimistic about the series. Lindsay Hassett said it wasn't the best team England had sent to Australia, but no other tried so hard to make cricket interesting.\nThird Test – Sydney.\n\"Often in bleak moments do I cast back to Bob Barber's 185 in front of 40,000 on that sunny Friday in January 66. He batted without chance for five hours, starting decorously enough and then hitting the ball progressively harder and with a superb disdain to every corner of the field. One recalls the exceptional vigour of his driving and how he brought his wrists into the cut, making room for the stroke. It made blissful watching to English eyes – to one pair in particular, for by a wonderful chance father Barber had flown in from home that very day.\"\nPreliminaries.\nThe Australian captain Bobby Simpson was unable to play due to chickenpox and his vice-captain Brian Booth led the team again. Grahame Thomas was brought into the team to open with Bill Lawry, Alan Connolly was replaced by the fast bowler Neil Hawke and the off-spinner Tom Veivers by David Sincock, one of the very rare specialist bowlers of left-arm wrist-spin. This type of bowling is usually reserved for part-time bowlers, but though \"Evil Dick\" could turn the ball and produce reverse googlies he struggled to produce a consistent line and length. England kept their team from Melbourne, except that Dave Brown was fit again and replaced Barry Knight. On a wicket famous for taking spin the toss was vital. Mike Smith won it for the first time in the series and chose to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\nBob Barber's father arrived that morning from England in time to see his son play the innings of his life. The attacking opener hit the Australian bowlers for 19 fours in his 185 in five hours. It was his only Test century, his highest First Class score and the 234 runs he added for the first wicket with Geoff Boycott – whose 84 gave him 1,000 Test runs – was the third highest opening partnership for England in Australia. He was out on 308/2, after which England collapsed to 328/5 in the last hour of the first day. John Edrich made a solid 103, but Colin Cowdrey, M.J.K. Smith, Dave Brown and Jim Parks were all caught by Wally Grout off Neil Hawke, whose 7/105 was his best bowling in Tests. Grout snapped up Fred Titmus off Doug Walters (1/38) to give him five catches and reduce England to 395/8, but Dave Allen made 50 not out adding 93 runs for the last two wickets with Edrich and Jeff Jones, whose 16 was his highest Test score as England made 488.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nJim Parks equalled Wally Grout's five dismissals in an innings with three catches and two stumpings, starting with Bill Lawry off Jeff Jones (2/51) for a duck in the first over. Grahame Thomas (51) and Bob Cowper (60) added 81 for the second wicket until separated by Dave Brown (5/63) and Australia were 113/4 by stumps. Cowper and David Sincock (29) added 50 runs together, but the tail collapsed and Australia were out for 221, 267 runs behind England as Mike Smith enforced the follow on.\nAustralia – Second Innings.\nThe wicket began to take ever increasing turn and wickets fell regularly to the England off-spinners Fred Titmus (4/40) and Dave Allen (4/47). Titmus took his 100th Test wicket and as he had passed 1,000 Test runs in the England innings completed the double of 1,000 Test runs and 100 Test wickets. Jim Parks failed to dismiss any batsmen, but the expert close fielders Mike Smith and Colin Cowdrey took five catches between them. Doug Walters top scored with 35 not out and David Sincock hit 5 fours in his 27 as Australia fell to 174 all out and an innings defeat on the fourth day. Smith tried to give Dave Allen the honour of leading the England team off the field, but he and the others insisted that their captain should enter the pavilion first. They were greeted by the Australian captain Brian Booth, who shook hands with all the England players with his typical good sportsmanship.\nResult.\nEngland beat Australia by an innings and 93 runs to give them a 1–0 lead in the series. It was the first time that Australia had lost by an innings at home since the Second Test of the 1936–37 Ashes series when they lost by an innings and 22 runs. It was their biggest defeat at home since the Fourth Test of the 1911–12 Ashes series when they lost by an innings and 225 runs (though they had lost the First Test of the 1928–29 Ashes series by 675 runs).\nFourth Test – Adelaide.\n\"Simpson now announced that his target would be a run a minute, an ordinary rate maybe in days gone, but a breakneck almost in the sixties, what with slow over-rates and so much accent on defence. Yet Australia, give or take a few minutes, achieved it, their captain leading the way with the highest opening stand ever, in a partnership with Lawry, for Australia against England: 244. I never remember seeing better running between wickets than of these two – and found myself comparing them, in fact, with Hobbs and Sutcliffe. With the field constantly changing over as right- and left-hander alternated, England, in much heat, sweated and chased unavailingly.\"\nPreliminaries.\nAfter Australia's biggest defeat at home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the selectors Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth received a letter from Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining \"Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the first to admit that your form has not been good.\" Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\nThe Adelaide Oval was notoriously flat, but Garth McKenzie was an expert on getting batsmen out on dull wickets and used the humid atmosphere and fresh pitch to bowl Bob Barber for a duck and have John Edrich caught by the ever-reliable Simpson at slip. Ian Chappell took a superb catch off Neil Hawke to remove Geoff Boycott and England were 33/3. Ken Barrington (60) and Colin Cowdrey (38) began to rebuild the innings with a 72 run partnership, until Cowdrey heard a shout from the Australian wicketkeeper Wally Grout, thought he was being called and was run out. Debutant Keith Stackpole took a great catch off Jim Parks (49) to give McKenzie his third wicket, who then removed Dave Allen and Dave Brown to give him his second five wicket haul in successive Tests. England were 240/9 at the end of the first day, which soon became 241 all out as McKenzie caught Fred Titmus (33) leg before wicket first thing in the morning to give him 6/48, his best Test bowling figures to date.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nWith eight recognised batsmen Australia could expect a large total even though Simpson insisted that they make their runs quickly and by the end of the second day they were 333/3 with the captain 159 not out. Even Bill Lawry responded with 9 fours and a six in his 119 as he and Simpson put on 244 runs in 255 minutes for the first wicket, more than the entire England first innings. This remained the highest opening partnership for Australia against England until Mark Taylor and Geoff Marsh made 329 for the first wicket in the Fifth Test of the 1989 Ashes series and remains Australia's highest opening stand against England at home. Grahame Thomas made 52 of the 87 runs he added with Simpson as Australia passed 300 for the loss of one wicket. Jeff Jones (6/118) put up a fight, dismissing Thomas, Tom Veivers, Peter Burge, Ian Chappell, Simpson and Keith Stackpole, who made 43 batting at number eight. Simpson was finally out after batting for 545 minutes, hitting 18 fours and a six in his 225 as Australia made 516 to give them a lead of 275 runs.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nComing in to bat late on the third day England could only hope for a draw, but Neil Hawke (5/54) gave them a worst start than in the first innings as they collapsed to 32/3. Once again Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey had to rescue their side, Barrington staying in for six hours making 102 while Cowdrey took two and a half hours over his 35 as they added 82 for the fourth wicket. The Adelaide Oval was Barrington's favourite venue and his century kept up his record of never scoring less than 50 runs there; 104, 52, 52 not out, 63, 132 not out, 69, 51, 63, 60 and 102, a total of 748 runs (93.50). Keith Stackpole removed Cowdrey and Mike Smith with his leg-spin, his 2/33 remaining the best bowling figures of his Test career. Fred Titmus (53) hit 8 fours and added 81 for the seventh wicket with the entrenched Barrington, but England did not outlast the fourth day and were dismissed for 266.\nResult.\nAustralia beat England by an innings and 9 runs to even the series 1–1. It was only the third occasion that two teams had defeated each other by an innings in successive Tests. The previous two instances were when England won their biggest victory over Australia in the Fifth test at the Oval in 1938 by an innings and 579 runs only to suffer their greatest defeat in the First Test in Brisbane in 1946–47 by an innings and 332 runs (the Second World War intervening). In 1952–53 Pakistan lost their inaugural Test against India at New Delhi by an innings and 70 runs, but won the Second Test at Lucknow by an innings and 43 runs.\nFifth Test – Melbourne.\n\"When Australia batted, Lawry, their stumbling-block-extraordinary, took root, and in an interminable left-handed stand with Cowper effectively doused English prospects. When this relentless fellow, having reached his sixth Test hundred against England, at length took a liberty he had made 592 runs in the Tests, average 84, the highest aggregate since Bradman's in 1946/7: not only that, he had scored 979 against Smith's side since they landed in Perth, and had occupied the crease for forty-one and a half hours. There was a gayer side to Lawry as we had seen at Adelaide – but he didn't let it obtrude too often. He just kept that long, sharp nose religiously over the ball, accumulating at his own deliberate gait...\"\nPreliminaries.\nEach team made one change from the Fourth Test at Adelaide. England replaced the off-spinner Dave Allen with the all-rounder Barry Knight and Australia made Peter Burge twelfth man after he declared that he would not tour South Africa, allowing Bob Cowper to return to the team. Therefore, England only had four and Australia three specialist bowlers in the deciding Test of the series. Mike Smith won the toss for the third time in a row and again decided to bat.\nEngland – First Innings.\nNeeding quick runs to force a win England made 312/5 on the first day, but Geoff Boycott hogged the batting, ran out his opening partner Bob Barber and took 75 minutes to make 17 runs. However, the obstinate stonewaller Ken Barrington surprised the crowd by hitting 2 sixes and 8 fours in his 115, one of his few sustained hitting displays. He made 63 off 101 balls then hit Keith Stackpole over long on for six and brought up his century 20 balls later with a six into the South Stand off Tom Veivers. His hundred came off 122 balls and won him \"one of the most moving ovations I have heard in Australia\", and the Walter Lawrence Trophy for the fastest Test century of 1966. He was caught for 115 by Wally Grout who told Doug Walters to bowl him a ball down the leg so that he could move over and catch the glance. Garth McKenzie (1/100) and Neil Hawke (1/109) suffered, but Doug Walters took 4/53 to dismiss Barrington, John Edrich (85), Colin Cowdrey (79) and Mike Smith (0). Jim Parks (89) and Fred Titmus (42) added some late runs before Mike Smith declared on 485/9 an hour before stumps on the second day.\nAustralia – First Innings.\nBobby Simpson and Grahame Thomas were soon out to leave Australia 36/2, but Bill Lawry and Bob Cowper saw out the day and batted through most of the next. Their carefully compiled third wicket stand of 212 avoided the follow-on and England's best chance of regaining the Ashes, but failed to entertain the crowd. Lawry made a typical 108 in 369 minutes, but Cowper was 159 not out at the end of the third day and Australia 333/3. The fourth day was washed out, rendering the final day of the series academic as a result could not be forced on the flat wicket. Cowper, however, took his score to 307, the first Test triple century to be made in Australia and at 727 minutes the longest. It was his highest Test and First Class score and remains the highest and longest Ashes century down under though Matthew Hayden's 380 against Zimbabwe in 2002–03 is now the highest Test century. In the end he was bowled by Barry Knight (2/105) on 543/8 and Simpson declared to leave England just over an hour to bat.\nEngland – Second Innings.\nGarth McKenzie made the most of the situation, taking 3/17 to dismiss Geoff Boycott, Bob Barber and John Edrich with England finishing with 69/3.\nResult.\nAustralia and England drew the Test and series 1–1, with Australia retaining the Ashes for the fourth time after regaining them in 1958–59. It was the second time the two teams had drawn the series in the last three Ashes series, with 15 of the 20 Tests being drawn (the next series was also drawn 1–1). It had already been realised that the captains on both sides were unusually cautious when playing each other as so much was at stake even though Bobby Simpson and Mike Smith had done all that they could to make the games interesting.\n1965–66 Test Series Averages.\nEleven batsmen averaged over 40 in the series, the most in an Ashes series in Australia since the timeless Tests of 1928–29 when twelve batsmen achieved this feat. It has not been equalled since, though ten batsmen averaged over 40 in 2002–03. Bill Lawry's 592 runs (84.57) was the most in an Ashes series since Don Bradman's 680 runs (97.14) in 1946–47 and his three centuries were the most since Arthur Morris three in 1948."

A first baseman, McManus threw and batted left-handed and was listed as tall and . He was born in Brookline, Massachusetts.\nMcManus entered pro ball in 1954 in the Detroit Tigers' organization. After four years in the Detroit farm system, on April 3, 1958, he was included as the \"player to be named later\" in a 13-player off-season trade with the Athletics in which the Tigers obtained second baseman Billy Martin and veteran outfielder Gus Zernial. McManus spent three more years in the minor leagues before Kansas City recalled him in September 1960. He went hitless in his first two at bats as a pinch hitter, then started at first base for the Athletics' final three games of the 1960 regular season, all against his original organization, the Tigers. McManus collected four hits in those three games, including his only extra-base hit and home run, a solo shot struck against Frank Lary on September 30. He ended his MLB career with a .308 batting average (4-for-13) and two runs batted in.\nDuring his two campaigns with the Taiyo Whales of NPB, McManus batted .236 with 20 home runs."

        "title": "Justin Wilcox (American football)",
        "text": "Justin Draper Wilcox (born November 12, 1976) is an American college football coach and former player. Since 2017, he has been the head football coach of the California Golden Bears.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Eugene, Oregon, Wilcox grew up as the younger of two sons on a family farm (wheat and cherries) in nearby Junction City. He played quarterback at Junction City High School and led the team to the 3A state title as a junior in 1993. He graduated in 1995 and considered Stanford and Arizona but followed family tradition and accepted a scholarship to Oregon under head coach Mike Bellotti.\nPlaying career.\nAfter redshirting his first year at Oregon, Wilcox found himself buried on the depth chart and switched to defensive back. A nickel back as a redshirt freshman, he lost most of the 1996 season to a knee injury. Wilcox became a fixture at safety until his senior season of 1999, when he was asked to fill a void at cornerback. He was invited to an NFL training camp with the Washington Redskins in 2000, but did not make the final roster. Wilcox graduated from Oregon in 1999 with a degree in anthropology.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coaching career.\nWilcox began his career as a college football coach in 2001 as a graduate assistant at Boise State, under new head coach Dan Hawkins. After two seasons as a graduate assistant, he left for the Bay Area to coach the linebackers at California under head coach Jeff Tedford. After three seasons at Cal, Wilcox returned to Boise State in 2006 as the defensive coordinator under new head coach Chris Petersen. In four years the teams lost only four games, with a record, and his defenses were statistically among the highest-rated in the nation.\nFollowing the 2009 season, Wilcox accepted the defensive coordinator job at Tennessee under new head coach Derek Dooley. In late December 2010, it was reported that Wilcox was a candidate to replace Will Muschamp, who left Texas for Florida. On New Year's Day, Wilcox announced that he would return to Tennessee for the 2011 season.\nEarly on January 2, 2012, reports emerged that Wilcox was to become the new defensive coordinator at Washington in Seattle, under head coach Steve Sarkisian. The position was vacant due to Nick Holt's termination days earlier, and the announcement was made official later that night. The Huskies were 7–6 in 2012 and lost in the Las Vegas Bowl. Washington was 9–4 in 2013 and won the Fight Hunger Bowl; Sarkisian left after the regular season for USC.\nWilcox followed Sarkisian to USC and was the defensive coordinator; the Trojans went 9–4 in 2014 and won the Holiday Bowl. After five games in 2015, Sarkisian was fired and succeeded by Clay Helton. The Trojans finished 50th nationally in scoring defense (25.7 points per game) and 65th in total defense (400.8 yards per game) in 2015, and Wilcox was terminated the day after the loss to Stanford in the Pac-12 championship game.\nOn January 28, 2016, Wilcox became the defensive coordinator at Wisconsin, under head coach Paul Chryst. The Badgers went 11–3 and won the Cotton Bowl with a defense ranked in the top ten in a number of categories.\nCalifornia.\nOn January 14, 2017, Wilcox was introduced as the 34th head coach of the California Golden Bears. The Bears went 5–7 during Wilcox's first year in 2017, with wins over North Carolina, Ole Miss, and #8 Washington State, and three losses by three points or fewer.\n2018.\nThe Bears went 7–6 during Wilcox's second year in 2018. The Bears upset #15 2018 Washington 12–10 and defeated USC 15–14 at the Coliseum in Los Angeles to snap a 14-year losing streak to the Trojans. The Bears lost 10–7 in overtime to TCU in the 2018 Cheez-It Bowl. In contrast to his predecessor, Sonny Dykes, Wilcox emphasized a strong defense, cutting Cal's points allowed per game from 42.6 (2016) to 20.4 (2018). However, the Bears’ offensive efficiency ranked as the second worst among all Power Five teams. After the regular season, Wilcox signed a new five-year contract to coach the Bears through the 2023 season.\n2019.\nThe Bears improved to an 8–5 record under Wilcox in 2019. They achieved their highest ranking since 2009 when they were ranked No. 15 after a 4–0 start to the season. After defeating Stanford in the Big Game for the first time since 2009, the Bears earned bowl-eligibility two years in a row, again for the first time since 2009. The Bears defeated Illinois 35–20 in the 2019 Redbox Bowl.\n2020.\nThe Bears finished 1–3 in a COVID-shortened 2020 season, with their lone win coming against #21 Oregon.\n2021.\nIn 2021, the Bears went 5–7, including wins over USC and Stanford. Cal notched a Big Game record 636 total yards of offense in a 41–11 victory over Stanford. Following the season, Wilcox signed a new contract extension keeping him at Cal through the 2027 season.\n2022.\nCal finished 4–8 in 2022, the program's third straight losing season. Following a six-game losing streak, Wilcox fired offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave and offensive line coach Angus McClure. The Bears defeated Stanford 27–20 to win the Big Game for the third time in four seasons, and the first in Berkeley since 2008.\nFamily.\nWilcox is the son of Dave Wilcox, an All-Pro linebacker for the San Francisco 49ers and a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Inducted in 2000, he played 11 seasons in the National Football League (NFL), from 1964 to 1974, all with the 49ers. From Vale in eastern Oregon, Dave played college football at Boise Junior College, then transferred to Oregon in 1962.\nJustin's brother, Josh Wilcox, was three years ahead in school and played tight end for the Ducks and two seasons in the NFL with the New Orleans Saints. Justin's uncle John Wilcox also played in the NFL, in the early 1960s."

        "text": "Tyler Johnson (born July 29, 1990) is an American professional ice hockey player for the Chicago Blackhawks of the National Hockey League (NHL). Johnson won back-to-back Stanley Cup championships with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2020 and 2021.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nJohnson was selected by the Spokane Chiefs with their 11th-round pick in the 2005 WHL Bantam Draft. In his first season with this team, in 2007–08, he appeared in 69 regular season games, scoring 13 goals and 29 assists. The Chiefs won the Ed Chynoweth Cup that season as the league's champions. The Chiefs subsequently earned a berth in the 2008 Memorial Cup, where they defeated the Kitchener Rangers by a score of 4–1. Johnson played in all 21 playoff games, scoring five goals and adding three assists. He was named the WHL playoffs' Most Valuable Player as a 17-year-old rookie.\nIn the 2008–09 season, he played in 62 games, scoring 26 goals and 35 assists for 61 points and adding another five goals and three assists in 12 playoff games. The 2009–10 season saw Johnson's numbers improve, as he tallied 36 goals and 35 assists in 64 games. He also added three goals and five assists in seven playoff games.\nJohnson's 2010–11 season proved to be his best yet as he became the 15th Chiefs' member of all-time to hit the century mark (100 points), with 53 goals and 62 assists, making him the leading goal scorer and second-leading points scorer in the WHL. He ultimately finished the season with career highs in goals (53), assists (62) and points (115), while also leading the team in power play and shorthanded goals and ranking third with a plus-27 ranking. He was named Player of the Month for the WHL for December 2010. He was also voted as the Best Overage Player, Top Defensive Forward, Best Skater, and Top Faceoff Man, second in Most Valuable to Team, and third in Most Accurate Shot in the Best of the West 2011 poll.\nTampa Bay Lightning.\nJohnson signed a three-year entry-level contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning in March 2011. Johnson's smaller size is known to be the reason he went undrafted.\nJohnson played the 2011–12 season with the Norfolk Admirals, the Lightning's top American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate. In March, he went on a 13-game scoring streak, including back-to-back two goal games, the longest streak by an AHL rookie in more than six years. This streak helped him earn the Reebok/AHL Player of the Month award for March 2012. Tyler Johnson was a key player in the Norfolk Admirals record winning streak of 28 games, which is a professional hockey league record. He was also a key player in Norfolk's first ever Calder Cup that Season.\nIn the 2012–13 season, Johnson would play the majority his time with Lightning's new AHL affiliate, the Syracuse Crunch. He would go on to lead the AHL in goals scored and named the regular season MVP. At the end of the season he was awarded the President's Award for outstanding accomplishments on the ice. Johnson and the Syracuse Crunch went on to go to the finals and would eventually lose to the Grand Rapids Griffins On March 14, 2013, he was called up by the Lightning and made his NHL debut against the New York Islanders.

He also finished third in the NHL in plus-minus rating of +33 for the season, also being chosen for the 2014–15 NHL All-Star Game. On April 27, 2015, during the 2015 Stanley Cup playoffs, Johnson became the first player in Lightning history to record three multi-goal games in a single playoff series. He also tied Ruslan Fedotenko for the Lightning single series goals record, with six. On May 20, 2015, Johnson tied Ruslan Fedotenko for most post-season goals in Lightning history.

On June 6, Johnson scored his 13th goal of the playoffs, the highest output in a single playoff year by a Tampa Bay player. Early in the 2015 Stanley Cup Finals, Johnson suffered a broken wrist, but he continued to play through the injury. However, this prevented him from taking faceoffs, and limited his production to just one goal.\nOn November 15, 2016, Johnson recorded his 100th career NHL assist on a goal scored by Nikita Kucherov. The assist came in a 4–3 Lightning win against the Detroit Red Wings at Joe Louis Arena.

Johnson missed much of 2021–22 campaign after sustaining a neck injury that required surgery and later suffering a concussion. He appeared in only 26 games for the Blackhawks, tallying only three goals and four assists, while maintaining a 60.8 faceoff percentage.\nInternational play.\nJohnson has also excelled in international competition, helping the United States to the gold medal at the 2010 World Junior Championships in Canada, recording three goals and five points with a plus-4 rating in seven games. He was named player of the game in their first-round game against Canada.\nPersonal life.\nTyler Johnson grew up in the Spokane suburb of Liberty Lake, Washington, where he graduated from Central Valley High School with honors.

It was the second W.A.K.O. event to be held in London (the 1980 European championship was also held here) and was open to amateur male kickboxers only and featured two forms of kickboxing - Full-Contact and Semi-Contact. By the end of the championships West Germany was the top nation in terms of medals, with US a close second and hosts Great Britain just behind in third. The event was held at the Wembley Centre in London, England, UK on Saturday, 22 October 1983.\nMen's Full-Contact Kickboxing.\nFull-Contact made a return to the world championships, having missed out at the last event in Milan, with more weight classes than ever before (nine), ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 91 kg/+200.2 lbs, with all bouts fought under Full-Contact rules. More detail on Full-Contact's rules-set can be found at the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules have changed since 1983. Many of the weight classes were newly introduced with the 60, 63.5, 67, 71, 75, 80, 91 and over 91 kg divisions replacing the 63, 69, 74, 79, 84 and over 84 kg divisions used at the 1979 world championships. The most notable winner was Ferdinand Mack who won his fourth gold medal at a W.A.K.O. championships. By the end of the championships, West Germany was the strongest nation in Full-Contact, winning three golds and three silvers.\nMen's Semi-Contact Kickboxing.\nSemi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that fights were won by using skill, speed and technique to score points rather than by excessive force - more detail on Semi-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules will have changed since 1983. At London there were seven weight divisions in Semi-Contact (two less than Full-Contact) ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs. By the end of the championships the US was easily the strongest nation in Semi-Contact, picking up four gold, two silver and two bronze medals."

        "text": "Michael Paul Montgomery (born July 1, 1989) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the first round of the 2008 MLB draft, and made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Seattle Mariners in 2015. The Mariners traded him to the Chicago Cubs in 2016. Montgomery recorded the final out in Game 7 of the 2016 World Series, earning the save and sealing the Cubs' first World Series title since 1908.\nProfessional career.\nKansas City Royals.\nMontgomery was selected by the Kansas City Royals in the first round, with the 36th selection, of the 2008 MLB draft out of William S. Hart High School in Santa Clarita, California. In 2012, he posted a combined record of 5–12 in 27 starts while splitting the season between the Royals' Double A and Triple A clubs. On November 20, 2012, the Royals added Montgomery to the 40-man roster in anticipation of the upcoming Rule 5 Draft of Minor League players.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn December 9, 2012, Montgomery was traded to the Tampa Bay Rays (along with Jake Odorizzi, Patrick Leonard, and Wil Myers) in exchange for James Shields and Wade Davis. He was optioned to AAA on March 11, 2013.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn March 31, 2015, Montgomery was traded to the Seattle Mariners for Erasmo Ramírez. After an injury sidelined James Paxton, the Mariners called Montgomery up to the majors for the first time on June 2, 2015. He started that night against the New York Yankees at Safeco Field, giving up one run, four hits, and walking two while striking out four and leaving after six innings with a 2–1 lead. He was on track to earn his first major league win, but the Mariners lost the game.\nOn June 23, 2015, Montgomery became the first Mariners left-handed pitcher to ever throw a complete game shutout with 10 strikeouts and no walks, getting the win against the Kansas City Royals 7–0. Following his first career complete game shutout, Montgomery pitched his second consecutive shutout on June 30, 2015. He allowed one hit, a double in the 7th inning, to the San Diego Padres in a 5–0 win. He was the first Mariners pitcher since Freddy García in 2001 to throw complete game shutouts in consecutive starts.\nMontgomery made the Mariners' opening day roster in 2016 as a reliever.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn July 20, 2016, the Seattle Mariners traded Montgomery and prospect Jordan Pries to the Chicago Cubs for prospects Daniel Vogelbach and Paul Blackburn. After allowing a three-run home run to the first batter he faced as a Cub, Montgomery performed well during the remainder of the season. He pitched in 17 games (including five starts), with a 2.82 ERA with the Cubs.\nMontgomery had a strong postseason performance in 2016, playing an instrumental role in the team's championship run. Cumulatively he went 1-1, including 11 appearances, innings pitched, and a 3.14 ERA. Most notably, Montgomery relieved Carl Edwards Jr. in the bottom of the 10th inning in Game 7 of the World Series. With a runner on first base and two outs in a one-run game, he finished the game with a ground out to third base. Montgomery earned his first career save, winning the World Series for the Chicago Cubs for the first time in 108 years.\nIn 2017, Montgomery made 44 appearances (14 starts), and a 3.38 ERA for the season. His record was 7–8, along with three saves. His performance through mid-May was exceptional, with his ERA dropping to 1.08. After gradually rising to 4.01 in mid-July, it leveled out in the remainder of the season. Montgomery hit his first career home run off Atlanta Braves pitcher R. A. Dickey on July 19.\nIn contrast with his 2016 performance, Montgomery struggled in the 2017 post-season.

Connolly has previously played in the National Hockey League for the Colorado Avalanche.\nPlaying career.\nUndrafted, after playing junior hockey in the AJHL for the Camrose Kodiaks, Connolly attended the University of Minnesota-Duluth in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association. Named to the WCHA All-Rookie Team after the 2008-09 season, Connolly remained on a point-per-game average through his sophomore season. In his Junior year, he led the Bulldogs with 54 points in 42 game en route to the NCAA Championship and a WCHA First All-Star Team selection.\nOn April 13, 2011, shortly after his team won the Championship, Connolly signed a three-year entry-level contract with the San Jose Sharks of the National Hockey League.\nIn his first professional season in 2011–12, Connolly was assigned to the Sharks American Hockey League affiliate, the Worcester Sharks. He led Worcester rookies with 30 points in 40 games before he was dealt by San Jose at the trade deadline on February 27, 2012, to the Colorado Avalanche, along with Jamie McGinn and Michael Sgarbossa in exchange for Daniel Winnik, TJ Galiardi and a seventh round selection. He was then assigned to the Avalanche's AHL affiliate, the Lake Erie Monsters. After two games with the Monsters, Connolly was unexpectedly recalled by the Avalanche and made his NHL debut against the Minnesota Wild in a 2-0 victory on March 4, 2012.\nAfter off-season knee surgery, Connolly missed the start of the 2012–13 season with the Lake Erie Monsters. As a result, Connolly struggled offensively upon his return until the latter portion of the season to contribute with 9 goals for 23 points in 65 games. His rights were not retained by Colorado and he was released as a free agent at the conclusion of his contract.\nOn July 18, 2013, Connolly was signed to his first European contract, on a one-year deal with German club, Augsburger Panther. In his first European season in 2013–14, Connolly quickly adapted to the larger ice and cemented his position as center on the top scoring line for Augsburg. Despite missing out on the post-season, Connolly lead the team with 28 assists and placed second in points with 42 to re-sign to a one-year extension on February 23, 2014.\nIn the following 2014–15 season, Connolly was limited to 22 games due to a cruciate ligament injury, and was unable to reproduce his initial success in the DEL. After finishing with 11 points, Connolly left as a free agent and signed a one-year contract with fellow DEL club, the Straubing Tigers on March 26, 2015."

The organisation was initially called the International Foundation for Disabled Sailing up until around 2008 when it had to change its name due to tax law in the country it is registered in.\nWorld Sailing reintegrated Disabled Sailing in November 2014 under it direct control and re-formed as ISAF Disabled Sailing Committee (DAC) -\n\"The creation of a single governing body for Member National Authorities (MNAs) and sailors will better serve the needs and interests of sailors with disabilities, and provide consistency within the sport, from relationships with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to technical support and operational efficiencies.\"\nTo complete the merger, the IFDS Foundation was dissolved during the 2015 ISAF Annual Conference held in Sanya, China. The Disabled Sailing Committee then rebranded as the Para World Sailing Committee, the new name for approval by the ISAF Council. Betsy Alison (USA) has been appointed as Chair of the Disabled Sailing Committee.\nEvents.\nParalympic Games.\nSailing was introduced to the Paralympic Games as a demonstration sport in 1996, and became an official Paralympic sport in the 2000 Summer Games.\nIFDS World Championships.\nThe organisation ran a number of ISAF recognised world championships to help develop international competition.\nEquipment.\nSailing is an equipment-based sport, therefore most boats can be adapted to suit certain disability types. The following classes are approved for use in the Paralympic Sailing event of the 2016 Rio Paralympic Games:\nRemoval from the Paralympic Games.\nIn late January 2015, the International Paralympic Committee dropped Paralympic Sailing from the 2020 Tokyo Paralympic Games as did Sailing \"did not fulfil the IPC Handbook's minimum criteria for worldwide reach.\"\nThe news was a major disappointment for the sport of disabled sailing worldwide. In the ensuing months, para sailors, supporters and MNAs worldwide blamed IFDS for failure to produce the required documentation to keep the sport in the Paralympics. A campaign to appeal to IPC to Reinstate Paralympic Sailing in Tokyo 2020 erupted on sailing blogs, news sites, social media, even ISAF and continued for months after.\nYachting Australia President Matt Allen said, \"The decision to take sailing out of the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games has left us stunned. We will consult with our ISAF colleagues to support the case for sailing and for all avenues to be explored for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games and beyond. We have spoken with the Australian Paralympic Committee who have offered their support and sought clarity on the decision from the International Paralympic Committee\", added Matt.\nCampaign for reinstatement to the Paralympic Games.\nWorld Sailing actively campaigns for sailing to be reinstated in the Paralympic Games. This follows substantial commitments to grow para sailing globally."

In 1989–90 the format was changed to include teams knocked out in the first round of the Challenge Cup. Castlebar Celtic became the first winners under the new format.

Working as a back judge (the title was changed to field judge in 1998), Kelleher was assigned five Super Bowls; Super Bowl IV, Super Bowl VII, Super Bowl XI, Super Bowl XV and Super Bowl XIX; one of five officials to reach such an achievement. He wore number 25 for all but two years of his career. For 1979 and 1980, Kelleher wore the number 7 when officials were numbered separately by position. He was born in Philadelphia, and died in Miami.\nKelleher ejected Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame safety Willie Wood from the 1962 NFL Championship Game vs. the New York Giants after Wood bumped him while protesting a call in the third quarter. The Packers overcame Wood's banishment to win 16-7 and successfully defend their championship, Green Bay's second of five in seven seasons under legendary coach Vince Lombardi.\nKelleher's humorous discussion with Coach Hank Stram during Super Bowl IV was caught on film by NFL Films. As Stram was complaining about a missed call, Kelleher pointed out that he was on the field, quickly ending the conversation.\nKelleher worked 10 consecutive seasons (1977–86) of his career on the crew of Jerry Markbreit (Markbreit was a rookie line judge in 1976 on the crew of referee Tommy Bell, with Kelleher as back judge), who later became the only official to work four Super Bowls (XVII, XXI, XXVI, XXIX) at the referee position.

It was played at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, Wales on 6 November 1999, between and with 72,500 in attendance.\nAustralia won the game by 35 points to 12, and with it, their second World Cup, having also won the 1991 tournament in England.\nMatch summary.\nFirst half.\nIn front of a capacity crowd of 72,500 at the recently completed Millennium Stadium, Australia met France in the fourth Rugby World Cup Final. For both teams it was their second Final. Australia were resilient in defence throughout the tournament while France promised an attacking back line full of talent. In damp and cold conditions France took an early lead with a Christophe Lamaison penalty after two minutes. Matt Burke equalled the scores after four minutes with a successful kick. The Australian forwards dominated in the loose and their tactic of continually kicking for territory and position proved effective. Lamaison offered some respite by slotting a 12th-minute penalty to give France a 6–3 lead. Injury and the subsequent substitution of Olivier Magne disrupted the France back row line-up after 20 minutes. Matt Burke's kicking was important as time and again French exuberance in the loose was penalised. By half-time the Australians led 12–6 with all points from the two goal kickers.\nSecond half.\nAs with the first half Burke and Lamaison traded penalty goals. After an hour the contest was still in the balance with the score at 18–12 to Australia. France continued to look lacklustre as the Wallabies began to mount a series of attacks.\nA Burke penalty after 64 minutes put Australia more than one score in front, and theoretically clear. With only 15 minutes remaining Ben Tune crashed over for the first try of the contest with Burke again adding the conversion points. The last action of the final was a rolling forward surge and try for Australian second-half substitute Owen Finegan. Inevitably Matt Burke slotted the conversion. Referee André Watson called time on the contest with Australia emphatic winners 35–12.\nAgain the final was hardly a classic match, though the modern approach of effective defensive lines and an outstanding goal kicking display proved to be rewarded. Australia were rewarded for their efforts with a second World Cup win and captain John Eales accepted the Webb Ellis Cup from Queen Elizabeth."

They currently play in London 2 South East - a league a level 7 of the English rugby union system - following their relegation from London 1 South at the end of the 2018–19 season.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nTerritorial Army officers and men of the Sussex Yeomanry formed a rugby club, which was affiliated to the Rugby Football Union in 1933. Records of their results have been lost in the mist of time but, post war in 1945 the players reformed and continued to turn out on Saturdays, the home matches being played at East Brighton Park.\nIn 1952 the Yeomanry could no longer continue without an influx of new players. The members approached Alderman Arthur Brocke who was then Mayor of Hove and Councillor Jack Woolley. They secured a pitch in Hove Park and the old timber Scout Hut was refurbished and extended to provide showers, kitchen and a bar.\nHove Recreation Ground.\nThe local Council had plans for Hove Park and the rugby Club had to plan for a move. After many false starts, the Club finally moved the short distance to Hove Recreation Ground ready for the start of the 2002–2003 season. The building of excellent new facilities and the provision of four pitches at one location gave the Club the facilities it needed to break out from the lower levels of the English structure and to enable it to look to the future.\nThe new Clubhouse was opened by the Mayor of Brighton and Hove in August 2002 – coincidentally, this was the Club's 50th anniversary as Hove Rugby Club.\nCurrent.\nHove Men's 1st XV currently play league rugby in London 1 South at level 6 in the pyramid.\nThe Women's 1st XV currently play in the Championship 1 South division, a league below the Women's Premier 15s.\nThe Hangover Trophy.\nThe Val Hayes Memorial Hangover Trophy is an annually contested fixture on New Year's Day between a Hove Rugby Club Invitation XV team and another club or invitational team. Originally the fixture was contested by Hove Rugby Club and the Robin Hood pub in Brighton, and now the fixture is sponsored by the Seafield pub.\nClub Honours.\nMen's 1st XV:\nMen's 4th XV:\nWomen's 1st XV:"

He played college football for the University of Florida, and was a member of a BCS National Championship team. He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft and played for the Steelers for eight seasons. Gilbert was also a member of the Arizona Cardinals for two seasons, although he never played a game for the team.\nEarly years.\nGilbert was born in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School in Fort Lauderdale, and was a standout lineman for the St. Thomas Aquinas Raiders high school football team.

        "text": "Darrell David Carpenter (born July 15, 1985) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros, Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, and Texas Rangers. He is currently the manager of the West Virginia Black Bears of the MLB Draft League and the pitching coach of the Fairmont State Fighting Falcons.\nHigh school and college.\nCarpenter attended East Fairmont High School in Fairmont, West Virginia and then West Virginia University (WVU), where he played college baseball for the West Virginia Mountaineers baseball team, from 2004 to 2006. While at WVU, Carpenter was a catcher. In 2004, he batted .235 in 81 at bats; in 2005, Carpenter posted a .282 average in 110 at bats; and in 2006, he hit .316 with 38 runs batted in (RBI) in 187 at bats.\nProfessional career.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nThe St. Louis Cardinals selected Carpenter in the 12th round of the 2006 Major League Baseball draft.

He both caught and pitched in 2008: catching for the Quad Cities River Bandits and Palm Beach Cardinals (hitting .215 in 65 at bats); and pitching for the GCL Cardinals and Johnson City Cardinals (posting a 1.84 earned run average (ERA) in 15 relief appearances, while striking out 17 batters in innings). For the 2009 season, Carpenter converted to pitching full-time and went 5–3 with a 4.28 ERA in 52 relief appearances for the River Bandits, striking out 77 batters in innings. In 2010, he began the season with the Palm Beach Cardinals.\nHouston Astros.\nOn August 19, 2010, Carpenter was traded to the Houston Astros for Pedro Feliz.

European Championships 1981 were the fifth European kickboxing championships hosted by the W.A.K.O. organization organized by one of the pioneers of Irish kickboxing George Canning. The championships were open to amateur men based in Europe only although each country was allowed more than one competitor per weight division, with the styles on offer being Full-Contact and Semi-Contact kickboxing.

        "text": "Edward J. Burke (December 4, 1945 – March 23, 2009) was an American college basketball coach who led the Drexel Dragons men's basketball program from 1977 to 1991.\nEarly life and high school.\nBurke was born in 1945, the fourth of five children. He liked to remark that he was the only one of his siblings that did not enter the religious life. He attended St. Joseph's Prep, where he played point guard on their high school basketball team. With NBA player Matt Guokas, Burke was a part of the 1962 Philadelphia Catholic League championship team as a junior. The team lost to West Philadelphia High School 61–52 in the city title game. As a senior, Burke led the entire Catholic League in scoring.\nCollege.\nBurke played for La Salle University from 1963 to 1967. A large knee injury ended his playing career in his senior season.\nEarly coaching career.\nAfter Burke graduated from La Salle, he earned a job as freshman coach at his alma mater, St. Joseph's Prep. He was soon promoted to head coach, and won the 1971 Catholic League Championship. Phil Martelli, current coach of St. Joseph's, was a member of that team, and said that Burke \"made coaching personal. It was about you as a person. He used a lot of humor. He made you want to practice, and he made you want to play.\" The following year, Burke coached St. Thomas More High School to a Catholic League title and to the 1972 City Championship. Burke won the Catholic League Coach of the Year honors for the second straight season. He is the only coach to accomplish this feat at two different high schools. St. Thomas More closed in 1975, and Burke came to Bishop McDevitt and West Catholic for one year each.\nDrexel.\nDrexel hired Burke as their new head coach in 1977. His top assistants for a few years in the 1980s were Villanova coach Jay Wright and former Bucknell coach Pat Flannery. His best season was in 1985–86, when his Dragons, led by Michael Anderson, won 19 games and defeated Hofstra in the East Coast Conference title game to earn a bid to the school's first NCAA Tournament. Drexel received a 15 seed, and lost to eventual national champion Louisville 93–73 in the first round. Following the season, he was named East Coast Conference Coach of the Year and Michael Anderson became the first Drexel player to make the NBA. In 1987, he coached the Dragons to an upset over the David Robinson-led Navy Midshipmen at the Palestra.\nBurke was released by Drexel on March 8, 1991, after finishing the year 12–16, the third consecutive losing season. According to Richard E. Woodring, the Drexel vice president for student life, Drexel wanted to head in a \"new direction\" as the school moved to the North Atlantic Conference in 1991–92. He was replaced by George Washington assistant Bill Herrion. In Burke's 14 seasons, he compiled a record of 205–189. His 205 victories are the second most of any Drexel coach.\nLater life.\nAfter his stint at Drexel, Burke returned to coaching St. Joseph's Prep, where he coached from 1992 to 1999. In 1999, he became the school's director of alumni relations and held the post until 2004. Upon retiring, he began to redo his family's restaurant, Burke's Inn, in Havertown, Pennsylvania. He added to the menu and turned the tavern into a sports bar.\nDeath.\nIn 2009, Burke was diagnosed with lung cancer. He was about to receive treatment when he died on March 23 in Havertown at the age of 63. He was survived by his wife, Bette Ann; his children, Melissa, Maureen, and Brendan; and \nfive grandchildren. Burke was buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon.\nCareer coaching record.\nThe career coaching record of Edward J. Burke is as follows:"

        "text": "Austin Charles Smith (born 20 May 1985) is a South African field hockey player who plays as a defender for Dutch club HC Den Bosch and formerly the South African national team. \nIn late 2021, Austin Smith announced his retirement from International Hockey. Smith has been a substitute supervisor and teacher in the International School Eindhoven in recent years.\nSmith competed for South Africa at the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, the 2010 and 2014 Hockey World Cups, and at the 2010 and 2014 Commonwealth Games. He has also competed at the 2005, 2009 and 2011 Men's Champions Challenge. He became captain of the side in 2009. He also joined in the Tokyo 2021 Summer Olympics and played for the South African national team.\nHe retired from club hockey after 14 years with Den Bosch in 2023. \nBiography.\nSmith was born in Cape Town, Western Cape, South Africa. He started hockey at the age of five years, and his parents played hockey for several years in South Africa and England. At Smith's Primary School, Pinelands North, he was introduced to hockey, among other sports. His coach at Pinelands, Murray Anderson, inspired Smith to focus on hockey.\nWhen Smith started at Pinelands High School, he had already succeeded, representing his Province at the U13 level. He went on to represent South Africa's U16 and U18 teams and became captain of each. He attributes a large amount of his achievement to one factor: \"I was extremely lucky to have such dedicated coaches at both my Primary and High School. Michael McConnachie, who spearheaded the hockey at the High School, was my biggest mentor and made me truly believe in myself.\"\nIn March 2004, aged 18, Smith achieved his lifelong dream of representing his country at a senior level. \"It was an incredible feeling walking onto the field to play my first match for South Africa, and it remains a special moment every time I wear the green and gold.\" In 2005 Austin represented South Africa at the U21 World Cup in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.\nSmith moved to the United Kingdom in 2005 to join Reading Hockey Club. He spent four seasons at Reading, winning the Premier League twice and making the final eight of the Euro Hockey League on consecutive occasions.\n2008 was a defining year in Smith's hockey career as he achieved another childhood dream by attending the Olympic Games. Despite South Africa's final placing of 12th in Beijing, he was the team's top goal scorer with four goals. To finish the year, he was named South African Men's Hockey Player of the Year and Reading Hockey Club's Player of the Year.\nIn 2009 Smith decided to leave the UK to join HC 's-Hertogenbosch in The Netherlands. Earlier in the year, he was named the captain of the South African squad, leading them to victory in the African Championship to qualify for the World Cup in 2010. Smith was also named in the World All-Star Team for his performances in 2009.\nIn 2010 Smith captained the South African squad at the World Cup and the Commonwealth Games, where they finished in 10th and 5th, respectively. Later in the year, he was named South African Men's Hockey Player of the Year for a second time. He announced his retirement from international play on 9 September 2021."

        "text": "Paul Rees (born 6 January 1969) is a former Australian professional basketball player who played his entire career in the Australian National Basketball League. Rees was known for his presence under the basket and while not blessed with a great jumping ability he was able to use his physical size to his advantage and was considered to be a strong rebounder.\nProfessional career.\nRees, a 6'9\" (205 cm) tall Centre, made his NBL debut in the 1990 season for the Brisbane Bullets. The Bullets made the NBL Grand Final that season but went down two games to one to the Perth Wildcats. After the club failed to make the playoffs in 1991, Rees signed with the North Melbourne Giants.\nRees quickly established himself as the starting centre for the Giants who hadn't made the playoffs since their 1989 championship win over the Canberra Cannons. The team failed to make the post-season in 1992 and only just missed out in 1993 under new American head coach Brett Brown. The 1994 NBL season would see Paul Rees win the first of his four NBL championships when the Giants defeated the Adelaide 36ers by two games to nil in the three game series. Rees was the NBL Grand Final MVP in 1994, averaging 18.5 points in the two games.\nThe Giants made it back to back grand final appearances in 1995, this time playing against the Perth Wildcats. Rees series wasn't as successful as the previous year as he averaged only 8.7 points over the three games and the Giants lost the series 1–2 to the Wildcats. 1995 was also the last year that the North Melbourne Giants ever made it to the NBL Grand Final.\nPaul Rees played another two seasons in Melbourne before signing with the Adelaide 36ers for the 1998 season. There under new coach Phil Smyth, Rees and the 36ers would both go on to win their second NBL championship when they defeated the South East Melbourne Magic two games to nil in the Grand Final. Rees averaged 7.4 points per game in his first year with the 36ers.\nAdelaide would finish the 1998–99 regular season in first place with an 18–8 record with Rees averaging 6.6 points and 4.3 rebounds per game. Both Rees and the 36ers would win their third NBL championship when they defeated the Victoria Titans two games to one in the Grand Final series.\nFollowing Semi-finals appearances in both the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 NBL seasons, the Adelaide 36ers, with Paul Rees maintaining his form but sharing the centre spot with teammate David Stiff (who also played at Power forward), made it back to the NBL grand final in 2001–02 where they faced the West Sydney Razorbacks who were led by Rees's former (1998) 36ers teammate John Rillie. Rees won his fourth NBL championship as the 36ers defeated the Razorbacks two games to one.\nThe 36ers only reached the elimination finals in 2002–03, following which, after 3 championships and 201 games for Adelaide, he was not offered a new contract. He then decided to move back to his original club, the Brisbane Bullets for the 2003–04 NBL season. The Bullets and Paul Rees made it as far as the Semi-finals before bowing out of a successful season.\nRees moved again after the 2003–04 season, this time moving back to Adelaide and the 36ers. He would spend another two seasons with the club helping them to reach the Quarter-finals in both 2004–05 and 2005–06 before finally retiring from basketball at the age of 37. He played a total of 508 games during his NBL career.\nOn the \"TITLE TOWN: The Adelaide 36ers in the 1990s\" documentary, Rees' teammates Rupert Sapwell, Kevin Brooks and Mark Davis told of a number of quirks that he had. These included pulling a muesli bar out of his sock after practice and eating it during warm down stretches, and a ritual of rushing back to the change room during the warm up for a game to check his cards and money in his wallet.\nInternational career.\nPaul Rees form in winning the 1994 NBL Grand Final MVP award was rewarded when was selected as a member of the Australian Boomers team that finished in 5th place at the 1994 FIBA World Championship. Playing as the 3rd centre behind team stalwarts Mark Bradtke and Ray Borner, Rees only played 2 games in the tournament averaging 4 points, 1 rebound and 1 assist per game in just 10 minutes of court time.\nIn March 1995, Rees played 3 games for the Boomers in the 5 game series against the touring Magic Johnson All-Stars."

It was the second time that W.A.K.O. had held a championships in Italy (the Europeans had been held there in 1979) and heralded the beginning of the organizations having its world championships every two years as opposed to once a year. The event was open to amateur men only from across the world, and featured two categories; Semi-Contact kickboxing and the newly introduced Musical Forms, and for the first time ever there was no Full-Contact kickboxing. By the end of the championships, West Germany were the top nation, with the USA in second and host nation Italy in third. The event was held in Milan, Italy in 1981. \nMen's Semi-Contact Kickboxing.\nSemi-Contact, now established by W.A.K.O. in all its major events, was the only form of kickboxing on offer at the Milan world championships. The rules for Semi-Contact differed from Full-Contact in that there was less physical contact and force used and points were awarded on a basis of skill, technique and speed – a more detailed version of Semi-Contact rules can be found on the official W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules have changed since 1981. As with previous events there was seven weight divisions, ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 84 kg/+184.8 lbs. The medal winners of each division are shown below with West Germany being the top nation in Semi-Contact by the end of the championship, with a haul of five gold medals and one silver. \nMen's Musical Forms.\nThe world championships in Milan saw the introduction of Musical Forms. Musical Forms is a non-physical competition which sees the contestants fighting against imaginary foes using Martial Arts techniques. Unlike the Semi-Contact category there were no weight classes, and an individual country was allowed more than one competitor to represent it. By the end of the championships all three medal positions were taken by American contestants but as the Musical Forms winners were not officially recognized by W.A.K.O. their medals would not contribute to the overall medals tally for countries. More information on Musical Forms can be accessed on the W.A.K.O. website, although be aware that the rules will have changed since 1981. "

It may be incomplete, and there also may be some inconsistencies due to occasional contradictory information between articles.\nJapanese baseball was organized originally as the Japanese Baseball League (JBL), starting with the 1936 season. For the 1950 season, the organization was renamed Nippon Professional Baseball and with additional clubs joining, it was broken into the Central League (CL) and the Pacific League (PL).\nVarious clubs have transferred from one city to another over time. Most of the clubs had also had several name changes, often independent of location, as a club's corporate owner is typically part of the club's name. For that reason, the first list is driven by team name. The second list is grouped by stadium name. The team list is confined to top-level professional clubs. The stadium list also includes some university-level clubs, where known.\nClubs listed alphabetically by current names, within league.\nExtinct clubs.\nThis is a partial list of clubs that were in the JBL and which disbanded or merged.

The first North West team to join the new league were the Chester Wolves; more teams from the North West joined the following season and a Northern Division was set up with teams from the North West and the North Midlands.

The Premier Divisions were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and were able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. In 2006, the RLC North West was renamed the Cheshire division as many Lancastrian and Cumbrian teams joined the Premiers, leaving a division dominated by teams based in Cheshire. Between 2007 and 2008, there were enough teams in the North West of England to run a Cheshire division alongside the North West Division.\nThe North West Premier came into existence in 2009, when the North Premier was replaced by the North West and Yorkshire Premiers; the creation of a separate North West Premier division meant that there were not enough teams to run a North West regional division that year, but the regional division made a comeback in 2010.\nNorth West-based teams had been playing in the Midlands Merit League and RL Merit League since 2007, but the North West got its own North West Merit League in 2010 to create a three-tier Premier, regional and merit league structure.\nRugby League Conference Pyramid.\nAbove the North West division is the RLC North West Premier and the National Division and below is the North West Merit League."

        "title": "Cricket diplomacy",
        "text": "Cricket diplomacy consists of using the game of cricket as a political tool to enhance or worsen the diplomatic relations between two cricket playing nations. Cricket is the second-most widely played game in the world after football, and is thus used as a political tool to bridge gaps in diplomacy between competing countries.\nAustralia and England.\nThe Bodyline controversy was detrimental to relations between England and Australia. The situation escalated into a diplomatic incident between the countries as the MCC— supported by the British public and still of the opinion that their \"fast leg theory\" tactic was harmless — took serious offence at being branded \"unsportsmanlike\" and demanded a retraction. Many people saw bodyline as fracturing an international relationship that needed to remain strong. Captain Douglas Jardine, and by extension, the entire English team, threatened to withdraw from the fourth and fifth Tests unless the Australian Board withdrew the accusation of unsporting behaviour. Public reaction in both England and Australia was outrage directed at the other nation. The Governor of South Australia, Alexander Hore-Ruthven, who was in England at the time, expressed his concern to British Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs James Henry Thomas that this would cause a significant impact on trade between the nations. The standoff was settled only when Australian prime minister Joseph Lyons met with members of the Australian Board and outlined to them the severe economic hardships that could be caused in Australia if the British public boycotted Australian trade. Given this understanding, the Board withdrew the allegation of unsportsmanlike behaviour two days before the fourth Test, thus saving the tour.\nThere were significant consequences for Anglo-Australian relations, which remained strained until the outbreak of World War II made cooperation paramount. Business between the two countries was adversely affected as citizens of each country displayed a preference for not buying goods manufactured in the other. Australian commerce also suffered in British colonies in Asia: the \"North China Daily News\" published a pro-bodyline editorial, denouncing Australians as sore losers. An Australian journalist reported that several business deals in Hong Kong and Shanghai were lost by Australians because of local reactions.\nEnglish immigrants in Australia found themselves shunned and persecuted by locals, and Australian visitors to England were treated similarly. In 1934–35 a statue of Prince Albert in Sydney was vandalised, with an ear being knocked off and the word \"BODYLINE\" painted on it.\nIndia and Pakistan.\nFollowing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Soviet pressure on India to deflect the tension they faced, in February 1987 Pakistan's President at the time, General Zia ul-Haq, attended a test match between India and Pakistan in Jaipur – a visit that apparently helped cool a flare-up in tensions since it led to a meeting with the Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi. Furthermore, in 2004 after a break of fifteen years, India toured Pakistan in the wake of diplomatic initiatives to bury half a century of mutual hostility. Both sides relaxed their tough visa regulations for each other, allowing thousands of fans to travel across the border.\nIn an attempt to replicate the cricket diplomacy of the past General Pervez Musharraf came to India in 2005 ostensibly for a cricket match. The trip, however, quickly took on the air of a summit as the sides were urged \"to seize a historic chance to end their dispute over Kashmir.\" Often this rivalry has been tinged with a religious-political bent to it. In 1991, the workers of the Indian political party Shiv Sena dug up the cricket pitch at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on the eve of an India-Pakistan Test match which was to be held there, forcing the entire series between the two nations to be cancelled. The Shiv Sena once again used this unique means of protest at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi in 2000 to protest against the Pakistan cricket team's proposed visit. Following the Kargil conflict, and at various other times, there have also been calls to suspend cricketing ties between the two countries.\nDuring the 2011 Cricket World Cup, the semi-final is believed to have eased the relationship between India and Pakistan after the polarising 2008 Mumbai attacks. Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh used this opportunity and greeted his Pakistani counterpart Yousuf Raza Gilani to watch the match with him at Mohali. Gilani subsequently accepted the offer and agreed to watch the match with Singh. In 2015, Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani requested the Indian government to allocate a cricket stadium for the Afghan team in India.\nChina and Taiwan.\nExtending a form of cultural diplomacy popularly called stadium diplomacy, China has also joined cricket diplomacy. Cross-Strait relations have been the impetus for doing so. During the buildup to the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Antigua received a $55 million grant to build the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium, while Jamaica received $30 million for a new Trelawny stadium. St. Lucia also built both a cricket and a football stadium courtesy of China. China spent a remarkable $132 million on cricket facilities in the West Indies over the past few years, compared to the International Cricket Council's 10-year budget of $70 million to promote cricket globally. The diplomacy paid off in the end as Grenada and Dominica derecognized Taiwan as an independent country. In 2009, of the remaining 24 countries that recognized Taiwan, four were in the Caribbean and two of those played cricket. Previously, Grenada had a stadium built by Taiwan, but it was damaged by a hurricane. To join the action, China quickly came in to erect another stadium. Consequently, Taiwan took Grenada to a New York City court to force the latter to return the original loan.\nTaiwan also used the World Cup to shore up its position among its shrinking West Indian support base. It doled out $21 million to St. Kitts and Nevis and $12 million to the even smaller St. Vincent and the Grenadines for cricket grounds. China's aggressive ambitions have benefited the Caribbean Islands as \"Strategic analysts say China is laying out more money than is needed to just isolate Taiwan. China, which has built large embassies in each of the islands, now has a bigger diplomatic presence in the Caribbean than the United States, the superpower next door.\" And that \"Mainland China's long-term strategy coincides with its foreign policy.\"\nIndia and Australia.\nIn March 2023, Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi hosted his counterpart Prime Minister of Australia Anthony Albanese at Narendra Modi stadium on the occasion of fourth test match of 2023 Border Gavaskar trophy. The event was organized as a tribute to the 75 years of diplomatic and cricket relations between two the countries. The two PMs visited the \"Hall of fame\" museum inside the stadium.\nThe event began with the two prime ministers singing the national anthems of their respective countries and shaking hands with the players of both teams. They then visited a gallery showcasing glimpses of 75 years of cricket friendship between the two countries. The two PMs visited the \"Hall of fame\" museum inside the stadium.\nThe event concluded with the two prime ministers tossing the coin to start the Test match. They sat in the presidential gallery of the stadium and witnessed some of the initial moments of the match.\nEngland and Zimbabwe.\nIn 2008, the England and Wales Cricket Board cancelled Zimbabwe's 2009 tour of England, and the Government of the United Kingdom subsequently suspended all bilateral relations between the two states in response to the situation regarding the 2008 Zimbabwean presidential election. MPs Jack Straw and Tessa Jowell wrote to the International Cricket Council asking them to ban Zimbabwe from international cricket."

The competition was held from July 22 to 23 1976. 64 fencers from 26 nations competed. Each nation was limited to 3 fencers. The event came down to a three-way barrage among the medalists, with two West German fencers joining Győző Kulcsár of Hungary (who had previously won gold in 1968 and bronze in 1972) in this tie-breaker fencing session. Alexander Pusch won against both opponents in the barrage to take gold, with Hans-Jürgen Hehn defeating Kulcsár for silver. The medals were the first for West Germany in the men's individual épée. Kulcsár's bronze made him the second man to earn three medals in the event (Edoardo Mangiarotti in 1948–1956, also with a gold and two bronzes, was the first).\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event, which was not held at the first Games in 1896 (with only foil and sabre events held) but has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1900.\nFive of the six finalists (including the three medalists) from the 1972 Games returned: gold medalist Csaba Fenyvesi of Hungary, silver medalist Jacques Ladègaillerie of France, bronze medalist (and 1968 gold medalist) Győző Kulcsár of Hungary, fourth-place finisher Anton Pongratz of Romania, and fifth-place finisher Rolf Edling of Sweden. The previous four years had seen the rise of Sweden and West Germany in the event; Edling had won the 1973 and 1974 World Championships; Alexander Pusch of West Germany was the reigning (1975) World Champion.\nThailand made its debut in the event. The United States appeared for the 16th time, most among nations, having missed only the 1908 edition of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1976 tournament returned to a mix of pool and knockout rounds similar to that used in 1968, after the 1972 edition briefly used a pool-only format. The competition included three pool rounds, followed by a double-elimination knockout round, finishing with a final pool round. In each pool round, the fencers competed in a round-robin.\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination round were to 10 touches. Repechages were not used in the first three rounds, but were used to determine medalists if necessary in the final.\nResults.\nFinal round.\nThe final pool was closely fought, with all six fencers at either 3–2 or 2–3. The three men who finished with three wins advanced to a barrage to determine the medals, while the three men who had only two wins in the pool were ranked by pool results. In the barrage, Pusch defeated both Kulcsár and Hehn to win the gold medal, with Hehn prevailing over Kulcsár to take silver."

        "text": "The 1982 Asian Games (also known as the IX Asiad) was a multi-sport event held in Delhi, India, from 12 November to 4 December 1982. A total of 3,411 athletes from 33 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 147 events in 21 sports and 22 disciplines. The number of participating countries was the greatest in Asian Games history. Sport events of handball, equestrian, rowing and golf were included for the first time; while fencing and bowling were excluded. This medal table ranks the participating NOCs by the number of gold medals won by their athletes.\nAthletes from 23 participating NOCs won at least one medal; athletes from 16 of these NOCs secured at least one gold. Athletes from China won 61 gold medals, the most of any nation at these Asiad, and led the gold-medal count for the first time in their Asiad history. Japan had won the greatest number of medals in previous editions of the Games. China first competed at the Asian Games in 1974, in Tehran, where it finished third. Athletes from both China and Japan won the most total medals with 153. China has secured the top medal spot in every Asiad since 1982. South Korea finished third in total medals. North Korea finished fifth in total medals, and fourth in the gold-medal count. Host nation India finished the games with 57 medals overall (13 gold, 19 silver and 25 bronze, its best performance since 1951), in fifth spot in terms of total gold medals.\nMedal table.\nThe ranking in this table is consistent with International Olympic Committee convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won (in this context, a nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. If nations are still tied, equal ranking is given; they are listed alphabetically by IOC country code.\nA total of 614 medals (199 gold, 200 silver and 215 bronze) were awarded. The total number of bronze medals is greater than the total number of gold or silver medals because two bronze medals were awarded per event in three sports: badminton, boxing and table tennis (except the team events).\n Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 200 metre medley in swimming and no bronze was awarded. In gymnastics events many shared medals were awarded; a three-way tie in men's pommel horse and a tie in men's ring for first place, meant that no silvers were awarded for those events. Three gymnasts in men's parallel bars and two each in men's floor, women's uneven bar and women's floor tied for second place, thus no bronzes were awarded in these events and also no silver was awarded for men's parallel bars. A tie for third in men's vault meant that two bronze medals were awarded.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNotes and references.\nNotes\nReferences"

Hungary was no longer the sabre power it once was, having been surpassed by the Soviet Union, though (along with Poland and Italy) continued to be among the perennial contenders.\nParaguay and Thailand each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 16th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 Olympics.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1976 tournament returned to a mix of pool and knockout rounds similar to that used in 1968, after the 1972 edition briefly used a pool-only format. The competition included three pool rounds, followed by a double-elimination knockout round, finishing with a final pool round. In each pool round, the fencers competed in a round-robin.\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination round were to 10 touches. Repechages were not used in the first three rounds, but were used to determine medalists if necessary in the final."

        "text": "The Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association (MLBPAA) is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization created in 1982 by former Washington Senators player Chuck Hinton to promote the game of baseball, raise money for charities, inspire and educate youth through positive sport images, and protect the dignity of the game through former players. It has also become a central point for former MLB players to keep in contact with each other and connect with current players. Its current president is Jim Thome.\nAbout the Organization.\nThe MLBPAA is headquartered in Colorado Springs, Colorado, and currently has more than 7,500 members: current and former major league players, umpires, managers, coaches, and front-office personnel, and fans. Through its charitable efforts, the MLBPAA has raised $42 million for both local and national charities including, but not limited to Children's Hospitals, American Diabetes Association, Boys and Girls Clubs, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Special Olympics, Leukemia Society of America, the Salvation Army, Meals on Wheels and Little League Baseball.\nLegends for Youth Clinics.\nThe Legends for Youth Clinic Series teaches young ballplayers (ages 6 to 16) the fundamentals of the game in a multi-station format, and stresses the importance of education to help kids recognize they have the ability to make positive decisions. Since the program's inception, the Legends for Youth clinics have reached more than 150,000 children across the United States, Europe, Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Puerto Rico, Nicaragua, and the US Virgin Islands.\nSwing with the Legends Golf Series.\nCreated in 1984, the golf events have featured some of the greatest names in baseball history. Reaching more than 30 cities across the United States, the series raises funds for both local and national charities as well as the Alumni Association. These events are held at some of the premier golf courses around the nation and provide participants with time with retired baseball stars.\nLegends for Youth Dinner.\nThe Legends for Youth Dinner is the primary fundraiser for the MLBPAA's Legend for Youth Clinic Series. Established in 1999, the dinner recognizes former players' on- and off-field accomplishments along with their contributions to communities across the nation. Other awards given out at the dinner for current Major League players include the National and American League Pitcher and Player of the Year Awards, the Dick Schaap Memorial Player of the Year Award, and the Heart and Hustle Award.\nHeart &amp; Hustle Award.\nThe Heart &amp; Hustle Award was created by the MLBPAA in 2005 and is presented annually to the current player who demonstrates a \"passion for the game of baseball and best embodies the values, spirit and traditions of the game.\" The winner is voted on by both alumni and active players and is awarded at the annual Legends for Youth Dinner in New York City.\nSubsidiaries.\nTo help former players, the MLBPAA wholly owns two for-profit organizations, MLAM (Major League Alumni Marketing) and MLAS (Major League Alumni Services).\nMajor League Alumni Marketing.\nMLAM was created to gain compensation for former players through endorsements and appearances, while protecting the names and likenesses of the individuals. Players are able to sign a Player Pool Agreement, which is a pool of group licensing and other marketing monies that are annually divided equally among the members. MLAM is separated into two divisions:\nLegends Memorabilia Collection (LMC) is one of seven licensed dealers of authentic Major League Baseball memorabilia. LMC was started to fulfill a niche and offer memorabilia signed by any living player who has ever played the game. Throughout the year, LMC hosts numerous private signings with Hall of Famers and many miscellaneous players who have experienced the big leagues. In 2011, LMC sponsored over 100 live auctions at Major League Ball Parks.\nLegends Entertainment Group (LEG) actively promotes players through endorsement deals and personal appearances. Since 1999, over $5 million has been paid to the alumni player (80% of these being non-Hall of Fame players).\nMajor League Alumni Services.\nMLAS strives to broaden membership programs including medical and pension benefits, while providing services outside the non-profit framework for the direct benefit of MLBPAA members such as free heart and lung care for former players, courtesy of Deborah Hospital.\nReferences.\nhttp://www.baseballalumni.com"

        "text": "Tommy Anderson (1887–1928) was an Australian rugby league footballer who played in the 1900s and 1910s. He played in the first ever match for the South Sydney rugby league club against North Sydney at Birchgrove Oval, and scored Souths' first ever premiership try. Anderson was also the NSWRFL Premiership's leading try scorer in the 1909 season.\nBackground.\nBorn in Redfern, New South Wales in 1887, Thomas Anderson played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs (first grade player number 2) in the first ever NSWRFL game. He played for Souths from 1908 to 1910. He then played a single game for Balmain. He then played a single game for Newtown and was never seen again. Anderson was still a teenager when the 1907 NSW vs All Golds (New Zealand) matches were played. For some time, Anderson was a wrestler and showed a promising career in Rugby Union as an Outside Back or Fullback.\nPlaying career.\nWhen the South Sydney Rugby League Club was formed, Anderson aligned himself with the new game. Unlike many of the older footballers, Anderson was putting his entire career on the line if the NSWRL (New South Wales Rugby League) failed, as many people in Sydney predicted that it would. And, putting aside fears of a lifetime ban from the Metropolitan RU (Rugby Union), Tommy set out to learn the skills of a new game with his teammates.\nWhen South Sydney first took to the field in 1908, Anderson started in the side as a winger. Shortly before half time, Anderson had the honour of scoring South Sydney's first ever premiership try. Anderson was beaten to the record of the first Rugby League try in Australia minutes earlier in the Easts (now the Sydney Roosters) vs Newtown match at Wentworth Park. South Sydney would go on to win the match 11–7. Anderson quickly began the rapid rise to the top of the 'Rugby League Tree', soon averaging a try a match. For the 1908 interstate series, which saw the New South Wales rugby league team's first ever match against their Queensland counterparts, Anderson was selected to play on the wing for the Blues, scoring four tries in the 43–0 defeat of the Maroons. Anderson was chosen in New South Wales first ever game against Queensland. The match was held as a trial for the Australian Kangaroos' selection. Anderson scored five tries in NSW smashing of Queensland 43–0. Anderson's name was again placed in the record books for the first ever try against Queensland. His performance guaranteed him a spot in the Kangaroos squad. The Kangaroos set sail for Great Britain on the day the premiership finals began, forcing Anderson and his South Sydney teammates to miss out on South Sydney's first ever Premiership win. Anderson played just five minor matches in Great Britain, and it is thought that his young age held him back from playing more. With the Test series against New Zealand already lost, the Australian selectors went with Anderson in the 3rd test, making him Kangaroo No. 19. Anderson slotted in at the centres with Dally Messenger. Jim Devereux was moved to the wing to allow for Anderson. At the break, New Zealand had a 6–0 lead. Few opportunities came Anderson's way. The ball was then shot out of the scrum to Messenger who then scooted in for a try. New Zealand would then score again to make the score 9–3. Messenger and Devaraux would soon combine and make an opening for Anderson to run in the try out wide. The score was now 9–8 to the New Zealanders. The home side were ripping into the Australians in an attempt to quiet their less experienced opponents. These clashes had become so 'close-quarters' that Anderson and Robert Graves both had their shirts ripped off. Two late tries to, including one to a half naked Robert Graves, gave Australia the win 14–9.\nUpon return to Australia, Tommy immediately took back his place at South Sydney and scored two tries in a spiteful 20–0 win over Newcastle. securing Souths a place in the final. As events transpired, the win by the 'Red and Greens' meant their winning of the premiership, after Balmain forfeited. This slightly disappointed Anderson, after again having missed out on playing the final. On the upside, Anderson was just 21, had two premierships, Test Match appearances, State, and International representation. Yet his career was over within 18 months.\nIn 1910 the Sydney Competition was well and truly alive. Top Union players had converted to League, crowds were huge, the English Lions were on their way ... and the Easts (Sydney Roosters) were filthy. Despite having the best players in the country, including Dally Messenger, they had no titles to their name, and South Sydney had two from two. When Souths came up against Easts, and they knew, just like every other team in the league, that the key to winning the match was to 'quiet Dally'. This job was assigned to Anderson. He was told to be physical with Messenger – make every tackle and hit him hard, to make him hesitate and deride him in front of his fans and teammates. Reports of the game show Anderson and Messenger meeting many times in the air, hitting chests. These clashes were so hard they were heard across the entire field. Anderson did his job of attacking Messenger valiantly. The entire stadium knew what was happening. However this seemed to have no effect on either player. Messenger played his game as if there was nothing different, and Anderson continued to hit him hard. Afterwards, Easts players were perplexed at Messenger's ability to take this barrage from Anderson. The same could not be said for Anderson however. Reports say that he was left the field \"severely shaken\". It was unclear if this was because of Messenger's unaffected state or if he was sustaining an injury. Anderson's form deteriorated over the last few weeks. He lost all his confidence and skill. He then lost his place in South Sydney and never regained it Anderson then moved to Balmain. He played a single game. He then moved to Newtown, and played a single game. His career then came to an end in 1913. Anderson's Australian tour teammates could tell that his end came after that match against Easts. Anderson lived out the rest of his life in 'a punch drunk state'.\nPost playing.\nAnderson enlisted in the Australian Army in 1915. He saw action in France for six months during 1916, but was medically discharged with a chronic knee injury that he would never recover from. His war records describe his injuries as an \"internal derangement of the knee joint\" and was sent back to England to recover. He returned to the front in 1917, only to have the knee turn septic in Ypres. He was returned to hospital in England again to recuperate but then suffered septic dermatitis. He also contacted venereal disease on a number of occasions, and was hospitalized. He was discharged from the A.I.F as medically unfit after the war ended and returned to Australia in October 1918.\nAfter returning home from war, he suffered from different medical conditions that stopped him from ever playing Rugby League again. Tommy Anderson, the South Sydney legend, died in virtual obscurity on 24 November 1928 at the Military Hospital, Randwick, New South Wales, aged just 41. He was buried at Rookwood Cemetery on 26 November 1928.\nRecords.\n1908: South Sydney First try scored for South Sydney\n&lt;br&gt;\n1908: New South Wales First ever try against Queensland\n&lt;br&gt;\n1909: South Sydney Top Try scorer in NRL\nBibliography.\nhttp://www.rl1908.com/Legends/Anderson.htm"

        "text": "The final of the 2015 Cricket World Cup took place on 29 March 2015 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Melbourne, Australia. It was played between the tournament's two co-hosts, New Zealand and Australia. Australia went into the game as favourites and won by 7 wickets for a fifth World Cup triumph. The match was played in front of 93,013 spectators, a record crowd for a day of cricket in Australia.\nBackground.\nThe 2015 Cricket World Cup started on 14 February and was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia across 14 venues. Fourteen teams were divided into two pools of seven, with the top four from each pool progressing to the quarter-finals. The final was played on 29 March and was a day-night match contested between New Zealand and Australia at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nIt was New Zealand's first World Cup Final. They had previously lost the semi-final on six occasions between 1975 and 2011. Australia played in their record seventh final, having won four (1987, 1999, 2003 and 2007) and lost two (1975, 1996).\nIt was the second consecutive time that two co-hosts contested the final: in 2011, India defeated Sri Lanka in the final while a third co-host Bangladesh exited in the pool stages. It was also the first time since 1987 that there was no Asian team in the final.\nThe match was also the last One Day International (ODI) for Australian captain Michael Clarke (who announced that he would retire before the match), Brad Haddin, and New Zealand's Daniel Vettori, the latter two announcing their retirements after the match.\nRoad to the final.\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand finished top of Pool A, winning all six games against Sri Lanka, Scotland, England, Australia, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. They faced the West Indies in the quarter-final at the Wellington Regional Stadium, winning by 143 runs. Martin Guptil scored 237 individual runs when New Zealand batted, the highest score at any World Cup and the second highest in ODI matches. In the semi-final at Auckland's Eden Park by 4 wickets in a rain-affected match against South Africa, with Grant Elliott hitting a six off the penultimate ball to win the game.\nAustralia.\nAustralia finished second in Pool A, losing against New Zealand, having a game cancelled due to rain against Bangladesh and winning their other four matches. In their quarter-final, they defeated Pakistan by 6 wickets at the Adelaide Oval, with Josh Hazlewood taking 4 wickets to help restrict Pakistan to 213 runs. They then qualified for the final by beating defending champions India by 95 runs in the semi-final at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Man of the match was Steven Smith, who scored 105 runs for Australia.\nBuildup.\nAustralia entered the final as strong favourites to win. Australia had a strong record at home, winning 24 of their last 26 games and former Australian cricketer Matthew Hayden suggested New Zealand would struggle with the larger field size at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), especially after playing all their tournament games on the smaller New Zealand grounds. Additionally, Australia had a much stronger record at the World Cup, having already won it four times. At the MCG Australia had won their last six matches, although they did lose the last time they played New Zealand there in 2009. Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting stated that Australia were overwhelming favourites and one could not find a weakness in the Australian team.\nNew Zealand's captain, Brendon McCullum, maintained an aggressive approach throughout the tournament, and said the final match would be no different. Australia's captain Michael Clarke said the loss against New Zealand during the group stages gave his side the \"kick up the backside\" they needed.\nMatch.\nMatch officials.\nThe match was umpired by Sri Lanka's Kumar Dharmasena and England's Richard Kettleborough, both of whom were on the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires. Kettleborough was named the ICC umpire of the year in 2013 and 2014 with Dharmasena winning the award in 2012. Dharmasena was part of the Sri Lanka team which won the 1996 final against Australia, and became the first person to feature in the final as a player and as an umpire. Sri Lankan Ranjan Madugalle was the match referee, South Africa's Marais Erasmus was the TV umpire and former England ODI international cricketer Ian Gould was the fourth umpire.\nDetails.\nNew Zealand won the toss and elected to bat. Brendon McCullum was bowled in the fifth ball of the first over by Mitchell Starc. By the time the second wicket had fallen, that of Martin Guptill, New Zealand were making slow progress and were 38 for 2 from 12 overs. Kane Williamson was caught and bowled the following over by Mitchell Johnson for 12 runs, followed by a maiden from Josh Hazlewood. By the halfway mark, New Zealand were 93 for 3 with Grant Elliott on 39 and Ross Taylor on 20. Taylor lasted until the 36th over when he was caught behind off the bowling of James Faulkner for 40. Faulkner enhanced his wicket maiden by bowling Corey Anderson for a duck, with New Zealand on 150 for 5 after 36 overs. Clarke caught Luke Ronchi from Starc's bowling for a duck and Daniel Vettori was dismissed three overs later for eight, leaving New Zealand on 167 for 7 from 41 overs. Elliot fell to Faulkner the following over, caught by Brad Haddin for 83, leaving both Matt Henry and Tim Southee at the crease on zero. Both were dismissed in the 45th over, Henry caught by Starc off Johnson and Southee run out. New Zealand's innings closed with them 183 all out.\nAustralia's start was equally ignominious with Aaron Finch being caught and bowled by Trent Boult in the second over for a duck. By the end of the 10th over, Australia were 56 for 1, with David Warner on 39 and Steve Smith on 13. \nWarner was dismissed in the 13th over for 45, being caught by Elliott off the bowling of Henry but Australia remained resolute to end the 20th over on 98 for 2, Clarke on 21 and the steady Smith on 25. By the end of the 30th over, Clarke, who received the majority of deliveries, was on 57 while Smith had 47. Clarke was dismissed in the 32nd, bowled by Henry for 74, but by now Australia required just nine runs from 113 deliveries. Shane Watson came in to support Smith as he struck the winning shot, a four off Henry from the first ball of the 34th over, to win the match by seven wickets.\nAustralian captain Clarke dedicated the victory to Phillip Hughes who had died after being struck on the neck by a bouncer the previous November.\nFall of wickets: 1/1 (McCullum, 0.5 ov), 2/33 (Guptill, 11.2 ov), 3/39 (Williamson, 12.2 ov), 4/150 (Taylor, 35.1 ov), 5/150 (Anderson, 35.3 ov), 6/151 (Ronchi, 36.2 ov), 7/167 (Vettori, 40.6 ov), 8/171 (Elliott, 41.5 ov), 9/182 (Henry, 44.5 ov), 10/183 (Southee, 44.6 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1/2 (Finch, 1.4 ov), 2/63 (Warner, 12.2 ov), 3/175 (Clarke, 31.1 ov)"

        "title": "SummerSlam (2011)",
        "text": "The 2011 SummerSlam was the 24th annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on August 14, 2011, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the third consecutive year. It was the final WWE pay-per-view event held before the dissolution of the original brand extension, which was introduced in March 2002, although the brand split would be reintroduced in July 2016.\nThe card consisted of eight matches, but only seven were televised. In the main event, WWE Champion CM Punk defeated WWE Champion John Cena to become the Undisputed WWE Champion with Triple H as the special guest referee, after which, Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and defeated CM Punk to win the WWE Championship. In another prominent match, Randy Orton defeated Christian in a No Holds Barred match to regain the World Heavyweight Championship. SummerSlam attracted a sellout crowd of 17,404 fans at Staples Center in Los Angeles, grossing more than $1 million, marking the highest grossing SummerSlam held at Staples Center. The event garnered 296,000 pay-per-view buys, down from 350,000 buys the previous year.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) produced every August by WWE since 1988—in April 2011, the promotion ceased going by its full name of World Wrestling Entertainment, with \"WWE\" becoming an orphaned initialism. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. The 2011 event was the 24th SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 14, 2011, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, California for the third consecutive year. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brand divisions.\nMuch like the previous year's SummerSlam, WWE promoted the event with its \"SummerSlam Axxess\" fan convention, held at the Nokia Plaza in LA Live on August 13 and 14. R&amp;B singer Cee Lo Green performed both \"'Bright Lights Bigger City\", the official theme song for the event, and his hit \"Forget You\" during the broadcast. The commentators for this event were Michael Cole, Jerry Lawler and Booker T.\nStorylines.\nThe professional wrestling matches at SummerSlam featured professional wrestlers performing as characters in scripted events pre-determined by the hosting promotion, WWE. Storylines between the characters were produced on WWE's weekly television shows \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\" with the Raw and SmackDown brands—storyline divisions in which WWE assigned its employees to different programs.\nThe main feud headed into SummerSlam from the SmackDown brand was between Christian and Randy Orton, over Christian's World Heavyweight Championship. At Extreme Rules in May, Christian defeated Alberto Del Rio in a ladder match to win the vacant World Heavyweight Championship for the first time, only to lose it to Orton on the May 6 episode of \"SmackDown\". After two unsuccessful attempts at regaining the title from Orton at the Over the Limit and Capitol Punishment pay-per-views, Christian finally won the championship for the second time at the Money in the Bank event in July, after he spat in Orton's face, provoking the latter to kick Christian in the groin and get himself disqualified; as per pre-match stipulations enacted by Christian, he won the title. On the July 29 episode of \"SmackDown\", the new Chief Operating Officer of WWE, Triple H, scheduled a title defense by Christian against Orton in a No Holds Barred match at SummerSlam.\nThe main event from the Raw brand for SummerSlam would pit John Cena against CM Punk for the WWE Championship. In the weeks leading to the Money in the Bank pay-per-view in July on \"Raw\", Punk announced the expiration of his WWE contract on the night of the Money in the Bank, en route lambasting WWE for failing to promote him as the \"best wrestler in the world\", and threatened some high authority figures like WWE Chairman, Vince McMahon, of defeating Cena and leaving WWE with the championship. At Money in the Bank, Punk pinned Cena to win the title, and even after McMahon tried to have Alberto Del Rio – who had won the Raw Money in the Bank briefcase earlier that night – cash in his contract against Punk. The latter nevertheless left the arena with the championship. The following night on \"Raw\", McMahon dismissed Punk's claim to the title, and announced an 8-man tournament to decide the new WWE Champion. Also, on the same night, Triple H relieved McMahon of his duties, and assumed control over WWE as the Chief Operating Officer just as the chairman was about to fire Cena. On the July 25 edition of \"Raw\", Rey Mysterio defeated The Miz in the finals to become the WWE Champion but lost it later on the same night against Cena. After the match, Punk returned to WWE with the title belt he had won at Money in the Bank, initiating a title dispute between Cena and Punk. As they were now two wrestlers with a claim to the WWE Championship, a one-on-one match between Punk and Cena was scheduled for SummerSlam to determine the undisputed WWE Champion. On the August 8 episode of \"Raw\", Triple H made himself the special guest referee for the Undisputed WWE Championship match.\nThe Divas rivalry heading into SummerSlam was between Kelly Kelly and Beth Phoenix over the WWE Divas Championship. On the August 1 edition of \"Raw\", Phoenix won a Divas battle royal to become the #1 Contender for the Kelly's Divas Championship at SummerSlam. Phoenix turned heel after her victory by attacking Kelly in and out of the ring, and later told Kelly that \"her days as the cute, blonde little bimbo are over.\" On the following week, Phoenix defeated Eve Torres in singles action, but was attacked by Kelly after the match.\nEvent.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe first match was a six-man tag team match pitting Kofi Kingston, John Morrison and Rey Mysterio against The Miz, R-Truth and Alberto Del Rio. Mysterio performed a 619 followed by a slingshot Splash on R-Truth to win the match.\nNext, Sheamus faced off against Mark Henry. Sheamus executed a Brogue Kick on Henry but Henry rolled out of the ring. Henry tackled Sheamus through the barricade. Sheamus was counted out, giving Henry the win.\nIn the next match, Kelly Kelly defended the WWE Divas Championship against Beth Phoenix. Phoenix attempted a Glam Slam on Kelly but Kelly countered the move into a Roll Up to retain the title.\nNext, Wade Barrett faced Daniel Bryan. Barrett executed Wasteland to win the match.\nMain event matches.\nIn the SmackDown main event, Christian defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Randy Orton in a No Holds Barred match. Before the match, Christian revealed that Edge will be in his corner for the match, but Edge told Christian that he was disappointed with him and walked away. During the match, Christian attempted an RKO through a broadcast table on Orton but Orton countered the move into an RKO through the broadcast table on Christian. Christian executed a KillSwitch on Orton for a near-fall. Orton performed a Snap Scoop Powerslam through a table on Christian and an Elevated DDT onto a Trash Can. Christian attempted a Sunset Flip out of the corner but Orton countered the move into an RKO on the steel steps to win the title.\nIn the Raw main event, John Cena wrestled CM Punk to determine the undisputed WWE Champion. Triple H served as guest referee. Cena executed the Attitude Adjustment for a near-fall. Punk performed a GTS on Cena for a near-fall. Punk executed a GTS to win the title, despite Cena's foot being on the bottom rope.\nAs Punk celebrated his WWE Championship win, Kevin Nash returned and attacked Punk with a Jackknife Powerbomb. Immediately afterwards Alberto Del Rio appeared and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract. Del Rio performed a Step Up Enziguiri on Punk to win the title.\nAftermath.\nIn March 2002, WWE initiated the brand extension, which promoted its core business of professional wrestling through such brands, named after their two major television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\". On the August 29 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that performers from Raw and SmackDown were no longer exclusive to their respective brand. Subsequently, championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; this would mark the end of the brand extension, as all programming and live events featured the full WWE roster. In turn, SummerSlam 2011 was the last pay-per-view to occur under the first brand split. In 2013, Stephanie McMahon revealed in an interview with \"Advertising Age\" that WWE's decision to end the brand extension was due to wanting their content to flow across television and online platforms. However, the brand split was reintroduced in July 2016, when \"SmackDown\" began broadcasting live on Tuesdays."

The All Blacks won the test series 2–1 and became known as \"the Incomparables\" for their feat of winning a series in South Africa for the first time.\nThe Rivalry.\nThe Springboks and the All Blacks have been typically regarded by many as the two greatest rugby playing nations of all time. New Zealand and South Africa had clashed in many tours over time which had been hotly contested. This included the controversial 1981 tour. The All Blacks had never beaten South Africa in a full-scale test series in South Africa. This was seen as the only blemish on the All Blacks record. All Black sides of 1928, 1949, 1960, 1970 and 1976 had all failed to beat South Africa away from home. The rivalry has always been hotly contested. 1996 was the year professionalism was introduced into rugby union meaning the creation of the new Tri nations and Super 12. As of 2021 no further full-scale tours have occurred between New Zealand and South Africa.\nMore recently the All Blacks had clashed with South Africa in the 1995 Rugby World Cup Final. The All Blacks lost that match but coming into this tour they had won the 1996 Tri Nations Series in the process beating South Africa twice.\nThe Tour.\nThe All Blacks and South Africa played four test matches; the first was the final match of the 1996 Tri Nations Series.

        "title": "Oxford University Lightweight Rowing Club",
        "text": "Oxford University Lightweight Rowing Club (OULRC) was the university rowing club for lightweight men at the University of Oxford which selected crews to race against Cambridge University Boat Club in the Lightweight Boat Races at the end of Hilary term. These races are usually held in late March each year.\nIn 2023, OULRC merged with OUBC, OUWBC and OUWLRC to form one Oxford University Boat Club.\nMembership and racing.\nMembership of OULRC was by competitive selection drawn solely from student members of the university. OULRC commenced the selection process in September prior to the beginning of Michaelmas term, recruiting from both undergraduate and postgraduate members of the University. By the end of Michaelmas, the squad was reduced to two trial eights which competed in a Trial Eights race in London over the course used for the race against Cambridge. From this squad the club selected a first crew, known as the Lightweight Blue Boat, and a reserve crew, known as Nephthys.\nThe Blue Boat went on to race Cambridge. From 2000 until 2006, Nephthys also raced against a lightweight reserve crew from Cambridge, Granta. From 2007, however, Cambridge declined to field a Granta crew, and Nephthys raced in the Head of the River Race and other external races. The squad also participated in BUCS championships.\nNephthys derives its name from the Egyptian goddess of the same name who was claimed to be the sister of Isis. Isis is the name given to the heavyweight reserve crew, and is also the term used within the university for the reach of the Thames between Osney lock and Iffley lock on which the college crews row. Although the Blue Boat did not compete in regattas after racing against Cambridge, OULRC did occasionally field crews in the Henley Royal Regatta, which often compete as Nephthys.\nThe Blue Boat crew had the right to wear a distinctive uniform. With lightweight rowing a full blue sport at Oxford, they wore an Oxford blue blazer with the club insignia on the chest pocket. Previously a half-blue sport, this replaced a blue and white striped blazer with OULRC embroidery or a blue blazer with white piping and embroidery worn in the early years of the club. Nephthys members wore a white blazer with blue piping, with crossed blades and the word Nephthys on the chest pocket.\nOrganisation and history.\nThe first Lightweight Boat Race was in 1975, and the first lightweight crew originally raced under the auspices of Oxford University Boat Club. OULRC was formed soon after. The management of the club was in the hands of an elected committee composed of students, although the day-to-day running was mainly in the hands of the president, who was elected by Blue Boat and Nephthys members each year. Like all Oxford University clubs, it also had a senior member, who is a university don.\nAlong with OUBC, OUWBC, and OUWLRC, OULRC was part of Oxford University Rowing Clubs which is the body that oversees all college rowing in Oxford. \n1987 mutiny.\nIn 1987, at the time of the OUBC Mutiny, a similar dispute also arose in relation to the selection of the Lightweight Blue Boat. This dispute threatened the running of the 1987 race. The President, David Whittaker, who rowed the previous year, had lost a selection race against another rower, Sean Sinclair. As president, Whittaker claimed the right to select the crew against the recommendations of the coach, and former OUBC Blue, Rob Clay. The crew, in turn, refused to row with Whittaker in the boat. The matter was finally resolved when an extraordinary meeting was called and life members from London travelled up to Oxford to elect Bob Macdonald as president. Ironically, one of the American OUBC mutineers, Dan Lyons, was called in to assist in coaching the 1987 crew after the original coach, Rob Clay, was called out of retirement to stroke Isis.\nFacilities and training.\nFor much of its history, OULRC trained outside of Oxford, variously at Radley (downstream) and at Godstow (upstream). From 2007, OULRC was based at the Fleming Boat House at Wallingford alongside OUBC.\nPast Crews.\nThis is a list of the OULRC / OUBC crews who raced the Men's Lightweight Boat Race against Cambridge.\n(*) denotes President of the Oxford University Lightweight Rowing Club"

        "title": "Teiken Boxing Gym",
        "text": " is a Japanese traditional boxing club based in the Kagurazaka neighborhood of Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan. Dating back to 1926, Teiken Boxing Gym manages professional boxers as a member of the , a subsidiary body of . Its president is the International Boxing Hall of Famer , its representative is , and the long-time female manager is . In order to distinguish from three related clubs i.e. Osaka Teiken Boxing Gym, Fukuoka Teiken Boxing Gym, and Hachinohe Teiken Boxing Gym, it is often referred to as \"Teiken (Boxing) Gym in Tokyo\" or \"Tokyo's Teiken (Boxing) Gym\".\nTeiken Promotions Inc. in Sakae-chō, Kita, Tokyo, also headed by the boxing promoter Akihiko Honda, is the managerial and promotional company for the Teiken Boxing Gyms and other worldwide professional boxers, as well as supervising the boxers' training. While Teiken Promotions has so far directed world champions such as Jirō Watanabe who belonged to Osaka Teiken Boxing Gym, Genaro Hernández, David Griman, José Luis Bueno, Eloy Rojas, César Bazán, Alexander Muñoz, Edwin Valero, Román González et al., Teiken Boxing Gym has brought up similarly the world champions Masao Ōba, Tsuyoshi Hamada, Jorge Linares, Toshiaki Nishioka, Takahiro Aō, Akifumi Shimoda, Shinsuke Yamanaka, Toshiyuki Igarashi, Takashi Miura et al.\nBesides, Teiken Promotions has provided boxing television programs on Nippon Television (under the auspices of the Hochi Shimbun), Nittele G+ and WOWOW. This article primarily focuses on Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo, while featuring the major activities of Teiken Promotions.\nHistory.\nEarly 20th century.\nWhen who learned boxing in San Francisco, California, United States since 1906 to bring it to Japan established as the first genuine boxing gym in Shimomeguro, Meguro, Tokyo on December 25, 1921, whose father lived in the United States and who aimed at becoming a trading merchant while studying at Rikkyo University, started boxing there under Watanabe's management. Ogino, a right-handed boxer known by his quick spear-like cross, was recognized as the Japanese junior featherweight champion by Nippon Kentō Club in 1922. That was one of the first boxing titles in Japan authorized at two weight divisions. His professional record was 8–2 (1 KO) with 9 draws, 2 exhibition matches, and one more match whose result is unknown. Since the gym collapsed in the Great Kantō earthquake, Ogino went on a visit to Shanghai, China with three boxers in spite of Watanabe's objection, in 1924. That first overseas expedition for Japanese boxers became an opportunity for the birth of Teiken Boxing Gym. Ogino also appeared in the Japan's first boxing movie in 1926.\nTeiken Boxing Gym separated from Nippon Kentō Club was founded under Ogino's direction as , commonly shortened as , in 1926. Evaluated as a good referee as well, Ogino also did the writing work. from Waseda University who became the president of the Korakuen Stadium later, and was also appointed as the first commissioner of the Japan Boxing Commission in April 1952, assumed the position of its founding president. Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo is the second oldest surviving boxing gym in Japan, next to , as of December 2013.\nAfter for the establishment of championships and the development of professional boxers was formed in February 1931, as Teiken Boxing Gym, one of its members, declared their secession in April 1932, the association was divided into two factions. Since Matsutarō Shōriki who owned the Yomiuri Shimbun released that they would hold the Japan–France confrontation matches with inviting world-class boxers from France in April 1933, two factions were reintegrated as an which was dissolved in 1937.\nMid-20th century.\nThen , the founding manager of Teiken Boxing Gym, who also acted as the chief director of from 1948 and the founder president of from 1962, was inaugurated as the president of Teiken Boxing Gym.\nThe 1960s when the distinctive Japanese and OPBF champions such as Kazuo Takayama, Teruo Kosaka, Kenji Fukuchi, Makoto Watanabe and Morio Kaneda won popularity has been termed as the \"Golden Age\" of Teiken Boxing Gym, as well as Japan's boxing of the same time having been called so. Kazuo Takayama's first world title shot against Davey Moore attracted 20,000 spectators at the Korakuen Stadium in August 1960. Teruo Kosaka's third world title shot against Gabriel Elorde which was his last match was watched by the audience of 33,000 at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, Philippines in June 1965. Today Yūjirō Watanabe, Sadayuki Ogino and Akira Honda are respectively referred to as \"Father of Japanese Boxing\", \"Mother of Japanese Boxing\" and \"Emperor of Japanese Boxing\".\nLate 20th century.\nWhen Akira Honda died as the president of Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo in 1964, his son Akihiko Honda took possession of that post at the age of seventeen with the help of Haru Nagano. In 1970 when Honda was a Rikkyo University's student at the age of twenty-two, Masao Ōba managed by him gained the first world title for Teiken Boxing Gym in the flyweight division. He is the current president of Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo as well as Teiken Promotions.\nTeiken Boxing Gym has continued a clear contractual relationship, the development of the boxers which does not give them a title shot in a hurry, and the steady promotion corresponding to each boxer's ability. They have given their boxers high rewards. As one example, Tsuyoshi Hamada's match fee for his second defense in July 1987 was 299,600 dollars in the amount of time.\nHonda promoted two of Mike Tyson's fights for the world heavyweight title both at the Tokyo Dome. The number of spectators of the fight against Buster Douglas in 1990 was 51,600, while its audience rating was 38.3 percent. Jimmy Lennon Jr. handled the ring announcements. As for the fight against Tony Tubbs in 1988, the attendance was 51,000 and the rating was 28.8 percent. Those two fights hold the top two attendance records in Japan's boxing history. Realizing a first world title tripleheader in Japan in 1998, Honda continuously carried it out seven times until April 2013.\n2000s.\nIn March 2007 Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo announced Tsuyoshi Hamada would take office as the representative of Teiken Promotions, while Honda would promote their boxers in the international market as the president. Shortly thereafter, Naoki Matsuda who was then uncrowned scored an epoch-making victory by knocking out Rodolfo López in Cancún, Quintana Roo, Mexico.\nWhen Takahiro Aō won the world title on March 12, 2009, Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo had simultaneously three active world champions. From that time, journalists of sports papers and others came to write it again as the \"Golden Age\" of Teiken Boxing Gym. However the fatal accident later mentioned in the section entitled #Two fatalities occurred during a Japanese title match just nine days after that, and Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo became comparatively estranged from worldly things.\nAt that time, the leading trainers in Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo were Sendai Tanaka and Yūichi Kasai. Tanaka who studied with the International Boxing Hall of Famer Amílcar Brusa is proficient in the Spanish language and had ever served as Marco Antonio Barrera's trainer. He guided Edwin Valero, Jorge Linares, Román González and Takahiro Aō to the world titles, while coaching the world title challengers Motoki Sasaki and Kōji Satō, the then Japanese champions Daisuke Nakagawa and Yoshihiro Kamegai, and the future world champion Carlos Cuadras et al. He also helped Yūichi Kasai. Kasai led Toshiaki Nishioka, Akifumi Shimoda, Toshiyuki Igarashi and Takashi Miura to their world titles, while training the former mixed martial artist Hiromitsu Miura et al. In addition, there are Shin Yamato, Yūji Nakano and several other trainers coaching boxers including the world champion Shinsuke Yamanaka, the future International champion Yasutaka Ishimoto and the current/former OPBF/Japanese champions. Since autumn 2009, Masahiko Nakamura has served as the strength and conditioning coach for the gym. He is responsible for trunk strengthening to balance their bodies.\nThe world title doubleheader on October 10, 2009 was also broadcast live on Azteca in Mexico, in addition to Japan and Venezuela.\n2010s.\nThe world title doubleheader on April 30, 2010 was broadcast live in three countries, and that on October 24 of the same year was carried live on Japan's NTV and the United Kingdom's Sky Sports, and relayed also in Mexico, Venezuela and Nicaragua.\nAlthough Takahiro Aō and Jorge Linares lost their world titles in the latter half of 2009, when Akifumi Shimoda became the sixth world champion for Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo in January 2011, there came to be three active world champions at the same time in the gym again.\nOne month before the sixth world title tripleheader for Teiken Promotions in April 2011, Honda unofficially announced two plans in the mid-2011 for Akifumi Shimoda and Toshiaki Nishioka to fight in the United States. Soon after that, Tōhoku earthquake occurred. Confirming the intentions of all participating boxers in that tripleheader, Honda considered their safety at the top priority. Then, preparing for the blackout, he made effort to secure by themselves the necessary minimum electric power for the live telecast and for operating the venue facilities, in consultation with Nippon Television which would broadcast the fights. However, he decided to refund all previous tickets and change the venue from the Ryōgoku Kokugikan in Tokyo to the World Memorial Hall in Kobe, Hyōgo for the risk management. That tripleheader event was relayed in the United States, Argentina, Italy and other countries, in addition to Japan's NTV and Mexico's Televisa.\nAfter that, Honda stated that it would be difficult for a while to hold events in Japan, due to power problems in the metropolitan area caused by the earthquake. In May of that year, Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo officially announced three matches from May through July in Mexico and the United States including Akifumi Shimoda's mandatory defense against Rico Ramos as the HBO televised co-main event to Paul Williams vs. Erislandy Lara at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey, staged by Goossen Tutor Promotions in association with Golden Boy Promotions and Teiken Promotions. In July of the same year, they released a world title doubleheader featuring Toshiaki Nishioka and Román González at the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in October, presented by Teiken Promotions in association with Top Rank and Zanfer Promotions. Since around that year, the gym has been more aggressively seeking opportunities for their boxers to fight outside Japan, while exploring new venues inside of the country. As of July 2012, they had had four reigning world champions. From the beginning of 2013, most of the leading boxers are often coached by Ismael Salas and Miguel Diaz in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nTwo fatalities.\nOn March 21, 2009, the minimumweight boxer of Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo, and Hosei University alumni Masatate Tsuji (born in 1978) lost his first title shot via a final round knockout in a ten-round bout in the thirtieth edition of the annual Japanese boxing series, the Champion Carnival at the Korakuen Hall. In October 2008, Tsuji who made a professional debut on October 19, 2002 had won the other annual series Japanese title elimination tournament nicknamed with the winner becoming the next mandatory challenger against the Japanese titleholder at the Champion Carnival, after defeating Akira Yaegashi in its semi-final match. In the scores until the ninth round of his fight in March 2009, all three judges gave a five to six point advantage for Tsuji. However fizzled from around three quarters, he lost consciousness just after the fight. Although Tsuji was taken to the hospital directly from the ring of the Korakuen Hall by the ambulance to undergo craniotomy immediately due to the acute subdural hematoma, he died without regaining consciousness on March 24, 2009. His final records were 31–19 (10 KOs) in amateur bouts, and 12–2 (3 KOs) with 2 draws in professional bouts. Tsuji now rests in peace on the Seto Inland Sea coast in his home city Hiroshima. Prior to that, the former Japanese lightweight champion Nobuo Kobayashi (born in 1910) of Teiken Boxing Gym has become the first boxing fatality in Japan at the Koshien tennis court in Nishinomiya, Hyōgo on September 1, 1930. Therefore, that was the second death for Teiken Boxing Gym as a result of injuries suffered in the ring.\nAfter Tsuji's fatality, Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo refrained from activities such as the advertisement and the recruitment of trainees, and closed their homepage. Besides, all six promising young boxers of Teiken Boxing Gym who had been slated to compete in the East Japan Rookie King Tournament in 2010, declined to participate in it. Such circumstances caused the criticism or the guess and even the rumor that Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo might close.\nAs Tsuyoshi Hamada told later, several boxers had fought wearing boxing shorts with Tsuji's name on them. Yoshihiro Kamegai and Shinsuke Yamanaka who both fought on the undercard of Tsuji's final match earned their first Japanese title shots wearing such shorts in the first half of 2010. Past the second death anniversary of Tsuji, Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo resumed the official website after the prior notice.\nWorld champions.\nFollowing above mentioned Masao Ōba (1970), Tsuyoshi Hamada won the world title in the junior welterweight division in 1986. While there were several multiple-time world title challengers such as Kazuo Takayama (1960, 1961), Teruo Kosaka (1962, 1964, 1965), Shūichi Hozumi (1983, 1986), Fujio Ozaki (1988, 1989), Shirō Yahiro (1993, 1996, 1998) and Yūichi Kasai (1994, 1996, 1997), no one got a world championship belt in Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo for about twenty-one years, although the boxers promoted by Honda such as Genaro Hernández (1991, 1997), David Griman (1992), José Luis Bueno (1993), Eloy Rojas (1993), César Bazán (1998), Alexander Muñoz (2002, 2007), Edwin Valero (2006, 2009), and Román González (2008, 2011) were crowned the world champions. On the other hand, in Osaka Teiken Boxing Gym, Jirō Watanabe (1982, 1984), Takuya Muguruma (1987) and Jōichirō Tatsuyoshi (1991, 1993, 1997) captured it from 1980s to 1990s. In those days, Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo's trainer Isamu Kuwata and Osaka Teiken Boxing Gym's trainer Jun'ichi Okubo were presented with the Eddie Townsend Award in 1992 and 1993, respectively.\nMeantime, the boxers continued training under the supervision of Honda, and under the instruction of trainers including Yūichi Kasai who retired as a boxer in 1997 and Sendai Tanaka who signed a deal with Teiken Boxing Gym in Tokyo in May 2003. They have a very strong solidarity as a team where each individual loves the gym. Once Jorge Linares (2007, twice in 2008) earned his first world title shot in the featherweight division in Las Vegas, Nevada, Toshiaki Nishioka (2008), Takahiro Aō (2009, 2010), Akifumi Shimoda (2011), Shinsuke Yamanaka (2011), Toshiyuki Igarashi (2012) and Takashi Miura (2013) successively secured it."

As regular season champions, they received an automatic bid into the 2012 NIT and faced Seton Hall in the first round.\nPrevious season.\nThe Seawolves were pre-season ranked second in the league, however, injures to most of their starters throughout the season largely affected the team. Tommy Brenton was out for the whole season due to injury and used a medical redshirt, Chris Martin also was injured most of the season, and other starters also suffered from injuries. The Seawolves struggled in the offensive end (ranked 337th in FG% in Division I), but were one of the top defensive teams in the NCAA allowing them to finish 5th in the America East with an 8–8 record. Despite the challenges in the offensive end, the Seawolves gained enough momentum to close the season with wins against Hartford and Binghamton. The Seawolves were ranked fifth in the 2011 America East tournament and went in an unlikely run to beat fourth seeded Albany, 67–61, and top seeded Vermont, 69–47, in back to back days at West Hartford, two teams who swept the Seawolves in the regular season series. For the first time in Seawolves Division I history they were to play in the America East Championship at second ranked Boston University. For most of the game, the Seawolves held to a substantial lead, and held a fifteen-point lead early in the fourth quarter. However, Boston rallied back with a late run to tie Stony Brook and take the lead with two seconds of regulation ending in a 56–54 loss for the Seawolves to end their season.\nBefore the season.\nLosses.\nThe Seawolves lost to graduation their sole senior Chris Martin.

The Seawolves came out victorious in four of the five occasions. All five games were broadcast in WUSB.FM, the first time the Seawolves were broadcast from international grounds.\nRanking and polls.\nIn October, the Seawolves were picked by multiple media outlets to finish #1 in the America East for the upcoming 2011–12 season. Sporting News College Basketball Preview magazine picked the Seawolves as #1 and also named Bryan Dougher a preseason All-America East. Lindy's College Basketball Preview echoed SNCBP announcements and CBSsports.com also picked the Seawolves to finish as regular season champions. The Seawolvesw were picked second in the Coaches Pre-season poll released in October 13, America East Tip-off, receiving 56 points and three first place votes against Boston U(defending tournament champions) 62 points and six first place votes.\nHonors.\nBryan Dougher was announced to be in Preseason All-America East first team released in the America East Tip-Off Luncheon in October 13.

Taken 2nd in the MLB draft in 1971 by the San Diego Padres at just 18-years old, Franklin pitched in three games before an injury caused him to sit out the 1972 season. He was relegated to the minors in 1973 and was released by the Padres organization in 1977.\nHigh school career.\nJay Franklin attended James Madison High School in Vienna, VA, graduating in 1971.\nProfessional career.\nFranklin was selected second overall by the San Diego Padres in baseball’s amateur draft in 1971, earning a $65,000 bonus. He remains Major League Baseball's highest high school draft pick from the Washington / Baltimore area.\nAfter being drafted by the Padres, Franklin was assigned to the Tri-City Padres of the Northwest League in Kennewick, WA, where he compiled an 8-1 record with 134 strikeouts in 104 innings. The Padres called him up to the majors in September 1971, making him the youngest player in the National League in 1971. He made his major league debut September 4 against the Atlanta Braves pitching two innings of shutout ball in relief and striking out two. He pitched out of the bullpen again on September 8 against the Cincinnati Reds giving up one unearned run in innings of relief. On September 21, manager Preston Gomez gave the starting nod to Jay Franklin in another game against the Atlanta Braves. After getting Felix Millan to pop out and Ralph Garr to ground out, Hank Aaron stepped up to the plate and hit his 638th career home run off Franklin. Franklin would pitch two more innings giving up home runs to both Darrell Evans and Ralph Garr before being pulled in the 3rd inning.\nAfter reporting to spring training in 1972, Franklin injured his elbow and was out for the entire season. He was injured again in 1973. Franklin spent two more seasons in Louisiana, then one each with AA Amarillo, TX, and AAA Hawaii before the Padres released him at the end of the 1977 season."

        "text": "Christian Patrick Thomas (born May 26, 1992) is a Canadian professional ice hockey forward currently playing for HC Bozen-Bolzano of the ICE Hockey League (ICEHL). Thomas played junior hockey for the Oshawa Generals of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL). Christian Thomas was drafted 40th overall by the New York Rangers in the 2nd round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft. Thomas made his National Hockey League (NHL) debut with the Rangers on February 23, 2013. He is the son of former NHL player Steve Thomas.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nThomas started his junior hockey career with the OHL London Knights in 2008 as the 13th overall selection in the OHL Priority Selection. He was traded to the Generals in the middle of the season in a trade in which London received Michael Del Zotto, John Tavares and Daryl Borden. During the 2008–09 season, Thomas scored four goals each for the Knights and the Generals. In 2009–10, his second OHL season, Thomas scored 41 goals. Tyler Seguin and Jeff Skinner were the only two 2010 first round draft picks to score more goals in junior hockey in 2009–10 than Thomas. He also was credited with 25 assists, for a total of 66 points, leading Oshawa in both goals and points. He had four shorthanded goals during the season, a new Oshawa franchise record. He was named the Eastern Conference's most improved player in a post-season coaches poll, and was also in the top three in several other categories—best shot, hardest shot, most dangerous in goal area, and best stickhandler.\nIn 2010–11, Christian Thomas finished second in the league with 54 goals and sixth in the league in scoring with 99 points, while also tying for the league lead in power play goals. He also finished 5th in the league in game-winning goals with nine. 12 of his regular season goals came against the Kingston Frontenacs, Oshawa's first round playoff opponent. He was named the OHL player of the week three times, including for the first week of the OHL playoffs. At the time Oshawa was eliminated from the OHL playoffs, Thomas was leading the OHL in playoff scoring, and he ended up 7th overall in playoff points and 9th in playoff goals. In the post-season coaches poll, he was named as having the OHL Eastern Conference's best shot and as \"most dangerous in the goal area,\" after finishing as runner up in those categories the prior year. He also repeated his runner-up status as having the conference's hardest shot. Thomas' 95 goals over the 2009–10 and 2010–11 seasons are more than any other OHL player over those two seasons. As a result of Thomas scoring more than 50 goals in 2010–11, Steve and Christian Thomas became the first father son combination to each score 50 goals in a single OHL season. Steve Thomas had scored 51 goals for the Marlboros in 1983–84.\nThomas got off to a slow start in the 2011–12 season, marred by a 10-game suspension for a high-sticking incident. However, he recovered and was named the OHL player of the week for the week of November 28 to December 4 for scoring 3 goals and 6 assists with a +6 plus-minus rating in 2 games. He was also named the Canadian Hockey League (CHL) player of the week for that week, beating out Jérôme Gauthier-Leduc and fellow New York Ranger draftee Michael St. Croix for the honour. He finished the season with 67 points in 55 games with 34 goals and 33 assists. In 6 playoff games he scored 2 goals and 2 assists. After the Generals were eliminated from the 2012 playoffs, Thomas joined the Connecticut Whale of the American Hockey League (AHL).\nProfessional.\nThomas signed a professional contract with the Rangers on May 19, 2011. He scored his first professional goal for the Connecticut Whale on April 13, 2012, against the Manchester Monarchs. In five regular season games for the Whale in 2011–12, Thomas scored that one goal and added one assist. He also played for the Whale in the AHL playoffs.\nOn February 23, 2013, Thomas was recalled to the Rangers.

        "text": "Jean Marie Smith (May 9, 1928 – March 13, 2011) was an outfielder and relief pitcher who played from through in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at , 128. lb, she batted and threw right-handed.\nJean Smith entered the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in 1948, beginning her career at outfield and later doubling as a reliever until the final season of play in 1954. Regarded as a disciplined hitter and a daring base runner, she posted a robust .334 on-base percentage and a 1.77 walk-to-strikeout ratio, while utilizing her speed to snatch 194 stolen bases in 567 career games. A member of a championship team, she also played in five out of seven possible playoffs.\nAAGPBL career.\nIn 1947 Smith attended a tryout of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \"After being selected at a try-out camp in Grand Rapids I was sent a contract in the mail for me to sign and also to be signed with consent with my parents or guardian. Both my parents gave me their permission\", she recalled. For her career, Smith was able to play well in all three outfield positions, mainly at center field. She then attended the 1948 spring training in Opa-locka, Florida, and was assigned to the Kenosha Comets.\nSmith was sent to the Fort Wayne Daisies during the 1948 midseason, just in time for playoffs, but Fort Wayne lost the first round to the Rockford Peaches, four games to one. She batted a combined .168 average with 36 runs and 22 runs batted in in 104 games.\nIn 1949 Smith also was used as a relief pitcher, because Daisies manager Dick Bass thought he had a hard fastball and a good curve. \"I was a thrower and not a pitcher\", she admitted. In that season, she collected a 3.38 earned run average in eight innings of work while playing 25 games at outfield. Fort Wayne advanced again to the playoffs, losing to the Grand Rapids Chicks in the best-of-three first round series.\nSmith opened 1950 with the Peoria Redwings. She finished with a 2–0 record and a 1.80 ERA in four relief appearances. As a hitter, she went 58–for–267 (.217) with 36 runs and 14 RBI in 89 games, including 10 doubles and three triples, while stealing 12 bases.\nSmith had her first good season in 1951, collecting a .233 average with 10 doubles and 38 stolen bases, driving in 30 runs while scoring 50 times in 93 games. She made 18 appearances on the mound, posting a 7–7 record and a 2.92 ERA in a career-high 111 innings.\nFor the next three years Smith played for the Grand Rapids Chicks, a strong team managed by Woody English, which included talented players as Jean Geissinger, Pepper Paire, Doris Satterfield, Dorothy Stolze, Connie Wisniewski and Alma Ziegler. Smith shared outfield duties with Geissinger, Satterfield and Wisniewski, hitting .196 in 46 games while going 1–2 as a reliever. Grand Rapids advanced to the playoffs, but was swept by the South Bend Blue Sox in the best-of-three series on strong pitching by Jean Faut.\nSmith had a solid season in 1953, hitting .227 with 73 stolen bases and a .343 OBP in a career-high 114 games, being surpassed only by Fort Wayne's Betty Foss for the most stolen bases (80). She also posted career numbers in hits (91), runs (86), doubles (20), triples (5) and steals, while walking 71 times and tying for third in doubles. In the best-of-three first round series, third place Kalamazoo Lassies disposed of first place Fort Wayne, and second place Grand Rapids drew fourth place Rockford. In the best-of-three final series, Grand Rapids swept Kalamazoo behind complete game victories by Mary Lou Studnicka and Earlene Risinger. In Game 1, Studnicka limited the Lassies to seven hits in a 7–2 victory, while Risinger drove in two runs and struck out nine to whip Kalamazoo, 4–3, in a cold weather, shortened seven-inning game. Smith went 3–for–10 and scored a run in the finals.\nIn her final season of 1954, Smith batted .252 (78–for–309) with nine triples, three home runs 56 RBI and 88 walks, all career numbers. She also scored 74 runs and stole 28 bases, while collecting a notable .397 on-base percentage in 88 game appearances. Fort Wayne repeated the regular season title and faced Grand Rapids in the first round of the playoffs, while second place South Bend played fourth place Kalamazoo. As a member of the champion team, Davis played in the All-Star Game against an All-Stars team selected by the league's managers. Fort Wayne and Kalamazoo defeated their respective opponents and advanced to the best-of-five final series.\n1954 Championship Title.\nIn Game 1 of the best-of-five series, the Kalamazoo Lassies defeated the Fort Wayne Daisies 17–9 behind a four-hit, seven strong innings from June Peppas, who also helped herself by hitting 2–for–4, including one home run. Her teammates Carol Habben and Fern Shollenberger also slugged one each, and Chris Ballingall belted a grand slam. Pitching star Maxine Kline, who had posted an 18–7 record with 3.23 ERA for the Daisies during the regular season, gave up 11 runs in six innings and was credited with the loss. Katie Horstman connected two home runs for the Daisies in a lost cause, and her teammate Joanne Weaver slugged one.\nThe Daisies bounced back in Game 2, hitting five home runs against the Lassies to win, 11–4. Horstman started the feat with a two-run home run to open the score in the first inning. In the rest of the game, Betty Weaver Foss added two homers with five RBI, while her sister Joanne and Geissinger added solo shots. Peppas, Nancy Mudge and Dorothy Schroeder homered for Kalamazoo.\nIn Game 3, the Daisies won the Lassies, 8–7, fueled again by a heavy hitting by Joanne Weaver, who hit a double, a triple and a three-run home run in five at bats, driving in four runs.\nIn Game 4, starter Gloria Cordes helped Kalamazoo to tie the series, pitching a complete game victory over the Daisies, 6–5. Habben drove in two runs who marked the difference, while Kline suffered her second loss of the Series.\nIn decisive Game 5, Peppas pitched a clutch complete game and went 3–for–5 with an RBI against her former Daisies team, winning by an 8–5 margin to give the Lassies the Championship title in the AAGPBL's last ever game. She received support from Balingall (3–for–4) and Schroeder, who drove in the winning run in the bottom of the eight inning. Peppas finished with a .450 average in the Series and collected two of the three Lassies victories, to become the winning pitcher of the last game in the twelve-year history of the league.\nBill Allington All-Stars.\nWhen the league was unable to continue in 1955, Smith joined several other players selected by former Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans All-Stars. The team played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Smith, the Allington All-Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Magdalen Redman, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.\nLife after baseball.\nFollowing her baseball career, Smith settled down in Harbor Springs, Michigan, where she worked as a secretary at the Harbor Springs IGA and as a bookkeeper for Woodland Buildersand. She also mowed the meadows at Barnyard Golf on her John Deere tractor until retirement in 1992.\nSince 1980, Peppas and a group of friends began assembling a list of names and addresses of former AAGPBL players. Her work turned into a newsletter that resulted in the league's first-ever reunion in Chicago, Illinois in 1982. Starting from that reunion, a Players Association was formed five years later and many former AAGPBL players continued to enjoy reunions, which became annual events in 1998. Smith attended the first reunion and regained communication with her teammates and old friends. Of the approximately 560 women who had played in the league, most had lost touch with the others, at least not until the reunion held in Chicago. The association was largely responsible for the opening of an AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personalities. Smith, along with the rest of the league's girls, is now enshrined in the Hall.\nJean Smith died in Harbor Springs, Michigan at the age of 82, following a brief illness.\nCareer statistics.\nBatting \nPitching\nOutfield fielding\nPlayoff hitting"

He served in the United States Army during World War II and missed the 1943–45 seasons before returning to baseball. He was selected by the Braves in the December 1947 minor league draft and spent most of the remainder of his 12-year active career in the Brave organization, including two full campaigns (1952–53) on the MLB roster.\nIn , Burris backed up regular catcher Walker Cooper and appeared in 55 games for the Braves during their final season in Boston. Burris batted .220 with 37 hits in 168 at bats. On May 30, he went two-for-two against the Dodgers' Carl Erskine, the only two safeties allowed by Erskine in a game Brooklyn won, 11–2. One of Burris's hits was his first big-league home run, a two-run shot that accounted for Boston's scoring. On June 12 against the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field, he shook off the rust by going four for five, with a double and his second big-league home run (hit off Paul LaPalme), and notched six runs batted in in a game the Braves won by an 11–2 score.\nBurris accompanied the Braves to Milwaukee when the franchise moved in March 1953, but he played in only two games before he sustained a season-ending broken elbow in an exhibition game in June.

        "title": "Italy v Brazil (1982 FIFA World Cup)",
        "text": "Italy v Brazil was a football match that took place between Brazil and Italy at Estadio Sarriá, Barcelona on 5 July 1982. It was the final second round group stage match for Group C in the 1982 FIFA World Cup. The match was won by Italy 3–2, with Italian striker Paolo Rossi scoring a hat-trick. The result eliminated Brazil from the tournament while Italy would go on to win it. The match has been described as one of the greatest in the history of association football.\nPre-match.\nBrazil had won all three of their first group stage matches, including comprehensive wins over Scotland (4–1) and New Zealand (4–0), and were the pre-tournament favourites. They were widely praised for their attacking style. In their initial second group stage match, Brazil beat South American rivals and World Cup holders Argentina 3–1.\nItaly, meanwhile, had a slow start to the tournament, having drawn all three of their first group stage matches and finishing runners-up in their group; they had only qualified for the second group stage by having scored one more goal than third-placed Cameroon. However, in the first of their second round matches, Italy had recorded an impressive 2–1 victory over Argentina. Italy's striker Rossi had failed to score up to that point and there was considerable debate about whether he should be in the team, as he had only recently returned from a two-year ban following his involvement in the Totonero 1980 match-fixing scandal. Italy were forced to play for a win to reach the semi-final, due to their inferior goal difference.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match put Brazil's attack against Italy's defence, with the majority of the game played around the Italian area, with the Italian midfielders and defenders returning the repeated set volleys of Brazilian shooters such as Zico, Sócrates and Falcão. Italian centre back Claudio Gentile was assigned to mark Brazilian striker Zico, earning a yellow card and a suspension for the semi-final. Paolo Rossi opened the scoring when he headed in Antonio Cabrini's cross with just five minutes played. Sócrates equalised for Brazil seven minutes later. In the twenty-fifth minute Rossi stepped past Júnior, intercepted a pass from Cerezo across the Brazilians' goal, and drilled the shot home. The Brazilians threw everything in search of another equaliser, while Italy defended bravely. On 68 minutes, Falcão collected a pass from Júnior and as Cerezo's dummy run distracted three defenders, fired home from 20 yards out. Now Italy had gained the lead twice thanks to Rossi's goals, and Brazil had come back twice. At 2–2, Brazil would have been through on goal difference, but in the 74th minute, a poor clearance from an Italian corner kick went back to the Brazilian six-yard line where Rossi and Francesco Graziani were waiting. Both aimed at the same shot, with Rossi connecting to score a hat-trick and send Italy into the lead for good. In the 86th minute, Giancarlo Antognoni scored a fourth goal for Italy, but it was wrongly disallowed for offside. In the dying moments Dino Zoff made a miraculous save to deny Oscar a goal, ensuring that Italy advanced to the semi-final where they would meet Poland.\nImpact.\nThe result was seen by many as not only a defeat for Brazil, but a defeat of their attacking philosophy by the more organised Italians.\nThis match has since then been labelled by the Brazilian press as the \"Sarrià Tragedy\" (Portuguese: \"Tragédia do Sarrià\"). The result of the match had a profound and lasting impact on Brazilian football and fundamentally changed its philosophy. According to Luizinho, Brazil's centre back in 1982, the defeat changed Brazilian coaches' way of thinking, leading to a new, destructive philosophy based on more tactical, physical, defensive, and counterattacking football, possessing similarities with the style of football played by the Italians against the Brazilians.\nAs described by sports journalist Tim Vickery: \"For many Brazilian coaches, the failure of that 1982 side to win the World Cup (...) served as proof for ideas that had been kicking around for a while – starting with a 5–1 massacre at the hands of Belgium in 1963, confirmed by the defeat by Holland in the 1974 World Cup. The physical development of the game, it was thought, meant that traditional methods had to be revised. Brazilian players had to bulk up – Rubens Minelli, the most successful domestic coach of the 70s, wanted his team to be made up of six footers. And with less space on the field, the future of football lay in the counter attack, rather than elaborate attempts to pass through midfield.\" Tim Vickery continues by stating that \"these thoughts have carried a lot of weight in the Brazilian game. They help explain why a succession of Brazil sides have caught the eye for explosive breaks down the flanks rather than for the succession of midfield triangles that enraptured Cappa and everyone else in 1982. When former Middlesbrough left-back Branco was in charge of Brazil’s youth sides, he told me that right from the start of the process the search for big, strong youngsters was a priority. Brazilian coaches, meanwhile, became fond of spouting the statistic that the chances of a goal are reduced if the move contains more than seven passes.\" He also earlier stated in 2006 that \"had Brazil won the trophy in 1982 the team would be more than a fond memory. They might be the blueprint for future sides, because winners are always copied.\" When describing the events of the match, Sócrates later infamously recounted: \"We had a hell of a team and played with happiness. Then Rossi had three touches and scored a hat-trick. Football as we know it died on that day.\"\nFurther success in 1994 and 2002 in mostly pragmatic, less flashy styles cemented the new philosophy and practically buried the traditional passing style further into the past.\nThe rise of tiki-taka, a style of football partly based on moving triangles, positional interchange and intricate passing – highly reminiscent of the old Brazilian passing style, embodied by the 1982 team – has helped recover some of the prestige of the 1982 team in the country. The crushing defeat of the Brazilian counterattacking style by tiki-taka teams, namely the 4–0 defeat of Santos to Barcelona and the 7–1 Brazilian defeat to Germany at home at the World Cup in 2014 laid bare how Brazilian football had been left behind. As a result, the country's football philosophy has been slowly returning to the old intricate passing style in the last few years, as recent success by Grêmio and Flamengo have shown."

        "text": "The following is a list of the annual selection by College Sports Communicators (CSC), known before the 2022–23 season as the College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA), and its Academic All-America sponsor of the individual athlete selected as the most outstanding of the annual Men's Basketball Academic All-America selections. Between 1996 and 2011, one winner each was chosen from both the college and University Divisions for all twelve Academic All-America teams including football. The Academic All-America program recognizes combined athletic and academic excellence of the nation's top student-athletes. The University Division team included eligible participants from National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I member schools, while the College Division team included scholar-athletes from all of the following: NCAA Division II, NCAA Division III, National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), Canadian universities and colleges and two-year schools.\nBeginning in 2012, CSC revamped its award structure. The University Division was renamed \"Division I\". Since then, NCAA Divisions II and III have had their own separate All-Americans. The College Division consisted only of non-NCAA institutions through the 2017–18 school year, after which it was effectively replaced by an NAIA division restricted to members of that governing body.\nCurrently, each team selects Academic All-District honorees in eight geographic districts across the United States and Canada. The districts are as follows: – District 1 (CT, MA, ME, NH, NY, RI, VT), District 2 (DC, DE, KY, MD, NJ, PA, WV), District 3 (NC, TN, VA), District 4 (AL, FL, GA, PR, SC), District 5 (IL, IN, MI, OH), District 6 (AR, IA, LA, MN, MO, MS, MT, ND, SD, WI, WY), – District 7 (CO, ID, KS, NE, NM, NV, OK, TX), District 8 (AK, AZ, CA, HI, OR, UT, WA, Canada).

In each of the four divisions (NAIA, Division I, Division II, and Division III), one of the twelve sport-by-sport Academic All-Americans of the Year is selected as the Academic All-America Team Member of the Year for that division. The most recent men's basketball players to receive the all-sports honor are Cooper Cook of Nebraska Wesleyan University and Kyle Steigenga of Cornerstone University, respectively named in Division III and the former College Division in 2018.\nHistory.\n, Illinois Wesleyan University has had the most men's basketball Academic All-America honorees, and three of them have been recognized with this award a total of four times.\nSeveral of the Men's Basketball Academic All-America of the Year winners have gone on to win the overall Academic All-America of the Year. Michael Smith was the first University Division overalll winner in 1988. Then, Alec Kessler (1990), Todd Fuller (1996) and Emeka Okafor (2004) also won the University Division overall Academic All-America. Before the College Division was split, Korey Coon (2000) and Troy Ruths (2008) won the overall award. Since the split there have been no Division I or Division II overall winners. However, Colton Hunt (2013), John Coleman (2015) and Cooper Cook (2018) have one the Division III award. Kyle Steigenga (2018) has won the College Division award.\nSeveral have been repeat winners of this award.\nTables of winners.\nNames in bold indicate winners of the all-sports Academic All-America award.

In autumn 2011, the names of different Leagues by letters AA and A within the Quebec Student Sports Federation are changed. The Hockey collégial féminin RSEQ is considered to be the highest level of young women's ice hockey in the Quebec collegiate system. The league has a wide range of talent from pre-university programs and is sanctioned by Hockey Quebec (Fédération québécoise de hockey sur glace) and the Quebec Student Sports Federation.\nThe Hockey Collégial féminin RSEQ is a development league serving as springboard towards the university women's ice hockey and afterward towards the professional level.\nHistory.\nPrior to the existence of the League, some collegial teams played with university teams in the Quebec University Women's Hockey League (QSSF). The first-ever Canadian Interuniversity Athletic Union (CIAU) National title for women's ice hockey was held at the end of the 1997-98 CIAU season and two Québécois college teams participated at the tournament: Cégep St-Laurent and Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf. The Ligue de hockey féminin collégial AA was founded in 1999 to provide opportunities for young females to develop into collegiate student-athletes. It was developed to bring together teams that regularly produce players for competition at the Canadian Interuniversity Sport women's ice hockey championship and NCAA National Collegiate Women's Ice Hockey Championship levels, respectively. The inaugural season was in 1999-2000, and the Patriotes du collège St-Laurent won the Playoff Championship title. A national championship for college athletics in Canada was approved at the advent of the 2001-02 season.\nCurrent teams.\nThe \"Hockey collégial féminin RSEQ\" consists of 8 college teams:\nExpansion.\nThe league has ambitions to expand from 8 teams to up to 10 teams for the 2012-13 season. The two proposed teams to be added are:\nChampionship regular season.\nThe team that claims the regular season championship does so by accumulating the best won-loss record in a season consisting of 21 matches:\nChampionship playoff.\nFollowing the regular season, a playoff is held to determine the Collégial women's champion in Quebec.

India has produced a number of tennis players, who have achieved international recognition and have made their presence in some of the top tennis tournaments and grand slams. All India Tennis Association (AITA) established in 1920, is the governing body of tennis in India and is a member of the Asian Tennis Federation. India Davis Cup team is the most successful team of Asia in Davis Cup, who has finished as runners-up 3 times.\nHistory.\nTennis has been a popular sport in India since around the 1880s when the British Army and civilian officers brought the game to India. Soon after regular tournaments like the \"Punjab Lawn Tennis Championship\" at Lahore (Pakistan, 1885); \"Bengal Lawn Tennis Championship\" at Calcutta (1887), and the \"All India Tennis Championships\" at Allahabad (1910) were organised. In the history of major tournaments, India has already beaten among others France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece in Davis Cup ties (1921 to 1929).\nThe history of tennis in India goes back a long way. In the 1880s, the British introduced the game of tennis in India during the colonial rule and soon it started gaining momentum. BK Nehru in 1905 and Sardar Nihal Singh in 1908 were later joined by M Saleem, Fayzee brothers and Jagat Mohan Lal who made it to last 16 stages at the Wimbledon. Ghaus Mohammad was the first Indian to reach the quarterfinals at Wimbledon in 1939 where he lost to American champion Bobby Riggs.\nAccording to the All India Tennis Association, in Davis Cup ties between 1921 and 1929, India beat, among others, France, Romania, Holland, Belgium, Spain and Greece. Top Indian players like Saleem, the Fayzee brothers, Cotah Ramaswamy and Krishna Prasad beat a large number of ranked European players and teams to bring glory to the nation.\nIn the 1960s, the sport witnessed a golden era. Ramanathan Krishnan earned his highest seeding – No. 4 in Wimbledon in 1962. In the Davis Cup, India repeatedly became the Zonal Champions. Ramanathan Krishnan, along with Premjit Lall, SP Misra, Jaidip Mukerjea and RK Khanna as the non-playing captain, steered India to the Cup finals in 1966. They lost the Cup but not before Krishnan and Mukerjea beat Newcombe and Tony Roche, the Wimbledon champions, (1965) in doubles.\nIn the 1970s, Vijay Amritraj burst onto the scene. With teammates Sashi Menon, Jasjit Singh and brother Anand Amritraj, Vijay took India to World Cup Finals for the second time in 1974. Vijay also made it to the quarterfinals of US Open in 1973 and 1981; and Wimbledon in 1973 and 1974. Ramesh Krishnan, the son of Ramanathan Krishnan, won the junior Wimbledon championship and junior French Open title in 1979 and was ranked number 1 junior in the world. He made it to the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (1986) and US Open (twice).\nThe 1990s saw the rise of Leander Paes who won the bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1997, Mahesh Bhupathi became India's first ever grand slam winner when he won the mixed doubles at French Open. Paes partnered with Bhupati to reach the finals of all four grand slams in 1999, winning two. In the 2000s and 2010s, playing separately or together, Paes and Bhupati won several grand slam doubles and mixed doubles tournaments.\nThe 2000s saw India's first WTA tournament winner Sania Mirza. Mirza also won a number of grand slam titles in doubles in the late 2000s and 2010s.\nIndia's last 2010s grand slam win came in 2017 when Rohan Bopanna won the mixed doubles title at French Open. At the end of 2010s, Prajnesh Gunneswaran was the only Indian men's singles player in the top 100. In 2021 Ankita Raina became the 2nd woman from India to win a WTA title and enter into top 100 doubles rankings. India's latest grand slam win came in 2024 with Rohan Bopanna winning the men's doubles title at Australian Open.\nIn February 2024, Sumit Nagal made his top 100 debut becoming the tenth Indian tennis player to reach the Top 100, which he reached by defeating Luca Nardi in the final of the Challenger in Chennai.\nGrand Slam finals.\nIn 1997, India won their first Grand Slam title at the French Open, in the mixed doubles. Since then Indians have won Grand Slam titles in the mixed doubles, men's doubles, women's doubles besides girls' doubles events. No Indian has so far won a Grand Slam Singles title in the men's or women's category.\nMixed doubles\nMen's doubles\nWomen's doubles\nHighest ranked players.\nTop 100 Ranked Players.\nThe list include Indian players who have had a ranking inside the ATP or WTA top 100. The rankings were introduced in 1973 (men) and 1975 (women)."

Following the rejection of entries from India and Vietnam, the group was organized into a three-team round-robin tournament between Japan, the Republic of China, and South Korea. The Republic of China later withdrew, leaving Japan and South Korea to play a pair of matches.\nBoth matches were played at Meiji Jingu Gaien Stadium due to a refusal by South Korean president Rhee Syng-man to allow the entry of Japanese players. The tournament was played less than a decade after the end of World War II, which ended the occupation of Korea under Japanese rule. South Korea won the first leg 5–1 and drew 2–2 in the second leg to earn qualification to their first FIFA World Cup. It was the last qualification tournament not organized by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), which was established in May 1954."

        "text": "Jeff Berry is an American attorney and sports agent. He is co-head of baseball at CAA Sports.\nBackground.\nBerry was born in Owensboro, Kentucky. He attended the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, where he was a catcher on the baseball team. After graduating with a Bachelor of Science in business administration, Berry signed with the Boston Red Sox, and spent one season as a catcher in their minor league system. Following his playing career, Berry was a graduate assistant baseball coach at Oklahoma City University, from 1995 to 1998. While at OCU, he earned his Juris Doctor from the university's School of Law, graduating cum laude in May 1998. Berry is a member of the Oklahoma Bar Association and a certified agent with the Major League Baseball Players Association.\nSports agent career.\nBerry is a co-head of CAA Sports' Baseball division. Forbes ranked Berry as one of the world's most powerful sports agents and since its inception in 2006, CAA has negotiated more than $3 billion in multi-year player contracts, advised 56 first-round picks and represented four MVPs, five Cy Young winners and seven Rookies of the Year.\nBerry also has a record as a fierce advocate for players, writing a memo in 2018 that outlined strategies for players to empower themselves in the labor battle. Berry told ESPN.com, \"As advocates, our job is to fight for and protect player rights, and when necessary, try and help create solutions -- not pointing fingers of blame and hoping things get better. And I wholeheartedly believe there are viable solutions to the core labor issues facing the game that can be remedied to the benefit of players, clubs and fans.\"\nBerry has been involved with multiple rule changes in baseball. Following Buster Posey's season-ending injury in May 2011, Berry lobbied Major League Baseball and the players' union to limit home-plate collisions, telling ESPN.com, \"You leave players way too vulnerable. ... I don't know if this ends up leading to a rule change, but it should. The guy [at the plate] is too exposed. ... I'm going to call Major League Baseball and put this on the radar. Because it's just wrong.\" Eventually MLB added Rule 7.13 to protect catchers.\nIn 2014, word leaked that shortstop prospect Trea Turner was the player to be named in a trade between the San Diego Padres and Nationals but could not actually be traded, by rule, for six more months. Berry told foxsports.com, \"Given the circumstances and the undoubtedly negative impact on Trea Turner, for the teams involved and Major League Baseball to endorse and approve this trade is not only unethical, but also goes against the very spirit of the Minor League Uniform Player Contract that players sign when they first enter professional baseball.\" In May 2015, MLB revised its rules and allowed players to be traded in the fall after they were drafted.\nIn June 2015, Berry successfully appealed an eight-game suspension of client Will Smith (pitcher) of the Milwaukee Brewers for having a foreign substance on his arm, getting the suspension reduced. Smith credited Berry for the victory, saying, \"My agent did his homework and cracked down on it. I felt comfortable leaving the meeting very well-represented.\"\nBerry has also helped enable trades for his clients to preferred destinations. Shortly after he told ESPN.com in December 2009 that Roy Halladay would not approve any trade after he reported to spring training, the Toronto Blue Jays dealt Halladay to the Philadelphia Phillies, who signed Halladay to a $60 million extension. In 2019, Berry said client J.T. Realmuto would not sign a long-term deal with the Miami Marlins, and by February, the Marlins traded Realmuto to the Phillies.\nPersonal.\nBerry and his wife Sarah have three children, two sons and a daughter. Berry is a frequent speaker at colleges, law schools and other events. In 2022, Berry was named to the Board of Directors of the V Foundation."

The club aimed to acquire more regular and more challenging competition than that which was on offer in Auckland at the time.\nThe club's first ground was a field in Newmarket donated by local farmer, James Dilworth, but its distance from the city prompted the administration, on behalf of the cricketers of Auckland, to apply for the use of the Auckland Domain and it began practicing and playing there in 1863.\nWhen the Auckland Cricket Association's first District Scheme came into effect in 1903, the club became the Grafton District Cricket Club. It was so-named because, under the terms of the scheme, it was allocated the area surrounding the Auckland Domain to draw players from.\nThe Scheme was abandoned in 1920, at which time the club paired its original and district names to form Grafton United. This remained in place until the second District Scheme of 1952 when the club became Metropolitan District Cricket Club for three seasons and thereafter Grafton and Districts Cricket Club. The Scheme ended in 1967 and the club returned to the Grafton United name.\nVictoria Park has been the club's home since the Auckland Cricket Association shifted clubs away from Eden Park in the early 1950s and, when the City Council leased the Campbell Free Kindergarten to it for a clubroom in 1960, it came to be thought of as Grafton's home ground exclusively. In partnership with the council, a new clubroom and indoor net facility were opened on the site of the old grandstand in 1993 and this continues to be the club's home.\nThe club celebrated its sesquicentenary in the 2012/13 season."

The tournament winner was Canada's Robbie Lavoie who defeated Poland's Piotr Bąkowski in the final on points to claim gold.

        "text": "Gladys Victoria \"Terrie\" Davis Smith ( Anthony; September 1, 1919 – October 26, 1991) was a Canadian shortstop and outfielder who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League between the and seasons. Listed at 5' 5\", 130 lb., Davis batted and threw right handed. She was born in Toronto, Ontario.\nCareer.\nTerrie Davis was one of the 68 players born in Canada to join the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in its twelve years history. She was among the top players in the early years of the circuit, winning the first batting champion title in 1943, being selected to the first All-Star Game, and as a member of the champion team in 1944. Noted for her enthusiastic and great knowledge of the game, she excelled defensively at shortstop, second base and all three outfield positions. Basically a line-drive hitter, she had a compact swing and tremendous plate discipline, collecting a significant .336 on-base percentage and a 2.05 walk-to-strikeout ratio (113-to-55) in a span of three years.\nThe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League operated from 1943 through 1954 and started with four teams: the Racine Belles and the Kenosha Comets, both from Wisconsin; the Rockford Peaches from Illinois, and the South Bend Blue Sox from Indiana. League play officially began on May 30, 1943 with the teams Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. Each team was made up of fifteen girls.\nDavis joined the Rockford team to become one of the sixty original founding members of the league. Her hitting was good enough to win the batting title win a .331 average in 102 games. She also led the league in total bases (155), finished second in hits (116), four behind South Bend's Betsy Jochum, and ranked third in home runs (4), runs batted in (58) and runs scored (78), while tying for second in triples (10). During the midseason took effect the first All-Star Game of the league, which coincidentally became the first night game ever played at Wrigley Field (July 1, 1943). The contest was played under temporary lights between two teams composed of Belles and Comets players against Blue Sox and Peaches players. At the end of the season, she was selected to the All-Star Team.\nBy 1944 the AAGPBL added two teams, the Milwaukee Chicks and the Minneapolis Millerettes. Davis divided her playing time between Rockford and Milwaukee, hitting a combined .246 average with 42 runs and 34 RBI in 80 games. The Chicks then went on to win the Championship Title, beating Kenosha in the best-of-seven series behind a strong pitching effort by Connie Wisniewski, who went 4–1 with a 0.40 ERA in five complete games, while Davis led the team with a .333 average (9-for-27), three runs, three RBI, and eight stolen bases.\nPersonal life and death.\nDavis was married and had a child before joining the league. She missed the 1945 season and returned with the expansion Muskegon Lassies during the 1946 midseason. She dropped to .202 in 58 games, driving in 31 runs while scoring 22 times, during what turned out to be her AAGPBL final season.\nAfter retiring, Davis focused on her family and interior designing business in Toronto. She died in Fort Erie, Ontario on October 26, 1991, at the age of 72. In 1998, she was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. She is also part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in , which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual personalities.\nCareer statistics.\nSource:\nBatting\nFielding"

        "title": "Time trial cycling equipment",
        "text": "Time trials have been part of cycling for more than a hundred years. The first time trial was run in 1895 after a ban on road racing was imposed by the National Cyclists' Union. It wasn't until 1939 that the time trial made its world stage debut as an official stage of the Tour de France. It was originally used as a method of drawing more people to listen to the Grand Tour on the newly available radio broadcast of the 1939 race. The main thing that distinguished the first time-trial from the traditional form of road racing was that the riders started at intervals instead of one large group and they raced against the clock instead of each other. Unlike road racing where the a rider can hang in the peloton and draft off of other riders to conserve energy, time trial races put the rider out alone on the course. There are no breaks and no one to draft off, causing a rider to push as hard as they can the entire race. Bicycles have also evolved to accommodate this new form of racing, with most of the breakthroughs occurring in the last 40–50 years with the introduction of triathlons.\nComponents of the bike.\nThere are several different aspects of a time trial bike that give the bike its wind cheating ability. \nTime-trial vs. road bikes.\nWhile both road bikes and time-trial originate from the old bikes used in the Grand Tours, these two classes of bikes have evolved in such a way as to cheat the wind and the clock and retained very few similarities. When the first time-trials were introduced into the Tour de France, little consideration was given to the type of machine the riders would use. The bikes they used for all of the group stages worked just as well as anything that existed during the time period, so that is what was used. Road bikes have existed as competition racing machines for almost 100 years before the earliest modern time-trial/triathlon bike made its debut in the cycling world. The traditional road frame, or diamond frame, which is still used on bicycles today, appeared barely a hundred years ago. At the time, it was considered one of the most technological advancement. Technology and science together have contributed to the development of today's time-trial machines. The average road bike in the hands of a professional cyclist averages speeds between 20–28 miles per hour depending on the terrain.\nComponent groups.\nEvery bike is made up of a series of components. The drive-train components are what make the bike go. These consist of the bike chain, front and rear derailleurs, crankset, and bottom bracket. The drive-train is the one part of the bike that doesn't change significantly between road bikes and time-trial bikes. The three main companies that produce component groups are Campagnolo, Shimano, and SRAM. Campagnolo is the oldest of the three, founded in 1933. Component groups are fairly universal on road bikes and time trial bikes. Both use the same group-sets and depending on the rider and the venue of the practice or race, the same gearing might also be used. The cranks are the main component difference between road and time-trial bikes. A standard crank, which is found on road bike, has two chain-rings and a gearing of 53×39, which means that the large chain-ring has 53 teeth on it and the little ring has 39 teeth. The teeth grab the chain and propel the bike forward. A standard time-trial crank typically has a gearing of 54×42 and has solid chain-rings instead of the hollow metal rings found on road cranks. High end time-trial chain-rings are made from solid carbon fiber with the exception of the teeth.\nAerobars.\nTraditional road bikes had drop bars that kept the rider in an upright position which created a lot of drag. The new triathlon bikes still had the drop bars, but they incorporated aerobars onto the handlebar. These new bars allowed the riders to get into a wind cheating position. Aerobars come in two different styles: clip-on systems and integrated systems. Clip-on aerobars attach to any handlebars to give the rider the aero advantage on a tri-bike. Integrated systems mean the aerobars and the basebars are all one system and attached to the bike as one whole piece rather than separate components like a clip-on system. There are a few advantages to this; the main one being that an integrated system allows the rider to get into a much lower position and thus be more aerodynamic. On the down side, these types of systems usually only work on tri bikes unless the owner wants to have their road bike completely overhauled into a tri bike. To get the best aero advantage out of the bars, companies spend countless hours in wind tunnels adjusting the aerobars.\nWheels.\nBeside the frame, the wheels are one of the most vital parts of the bike when it comes to performance. When designing wheels, companies take two major factors into consideration: the weight of the wheel and its shape. The shape of the wheels depends on what its primary use is going to be. Most racing wheels are made with carbon fiber rims and have deeper rims, otherwise known as \"deep dishes.\" While these wheels have been proven to increase a rider's power up to 30%, they can also affect the stability of the bike, especially with crosswinds. They also affect the turning radius of the bike and the rider comfort. These wheels have deeper rims in order to better deflect the air around the wheel. Traditionally wheels come in two sizes, 650c and 700c. The 650c wheels have the advantage of being smaller and lighter which give them a slight advantage on hills but because they do not do as good of a job displacing weight around the bike they are an option for smaller riders. The 700c wheels are the universal size that is used on almost every bike made today. On the rare occasion, a 650c front wheel is paired with a 700c rear wheel to gain better aerodynamics Some of the top racing wheels are built by companies like HED Cycling Products, Zipp, DT Swiss, Shimano, Easton, and Reynolds among others. These carbon fiber specialty wheels are typically only used by individuals who intend to compete, partially because the price tag on a given wheelset can run from $1,300 (Sram S60) up to $6,000 (Reynolds RZR 92.2) \nSpecialized hydration systems.\nHydration is a major part of an athlete's daily life. It is essential for their success both during practice and while competing. As bike technology has evolved, so has the technology for re-fueling the athlete. On a traditional road bike, which has a standard triangular frame, there is more than enough room for two large water-bottles. At most, modern time-trial bikes will hold one water bottle within the frame. High-end time-trial bikes do not have attachments for water bottles within the frame. This lack of water bottle attachments and the need to keep the aero-position throughout a race has not surprisingly led to the development of aero-hydration systems. Due to this lack of water-bottle storage, there are two main types of aero-hydration systems; behind the saddle (seat) and between the aero-bars. Rear-mounted hydration systems attach to the rail on the saddle and are positioned to smooth the air flow over the rider. These types of systems can either consist of a simple seat-mounted water bottle holder that typically holds two water bottles, or a seat-mounted bladder with a drinking tube running along the frame up to the rider. Front-mounted hydration systems have aero properties similar to those of a rear-mounted system, to create as little wind resistance as possible. A front-mounted system is almost always tucked between the aerobars. The most commonly used type of front-mounted hydration system is a water bottle that tucks between the aerobars with a straw that extends up to the rider but can be folded out of the way when not in use.\nAero savings.\nTime-trial bikes provide a significant aerodynamic advantage over standard road bikes. If a rider averages 75–80 minutes to complete a 40 km course on a road bike, using a traditional metal frame, shallow rimmed wheels, and standard road bike components, including a down-tube mounted water-bottle, then switching these road components to the aerodynamic counterparts could shave the following times off their total ride.\nPositioning\nPro and elite level cyclists turn to the wind-tunnels to constantly seek refinement and improvements in their individual time trial on-the-bike positioning. Professionally measured, out-on-the-road tested positioning (arms inwards as much as physiologically possible, knees in pedalling, head and body in better alignment in the time trialing, aero position, etc.) will see as much as a 6-minutes improvement in non-aero or former poor aero positioning. Empirical evidence shows that it is far more important to aerodynamically improve a rider's position than to rely solely on technology in order to better one's time trialing results.\nAerobars \nThese will bring the rider forward and drop you into an aero tuck with a flatter back and narrow elbows. Time saved: 3–5 minutes.\nBetter ride \nKnowing one's physical capabilities and the course will mean one can ride the 40 km in the quickest way possible. Time saved: 1–3 mins.\nAero helmet\nSmooth airflow reduces drag around the head. Time saved: up to 1 min.\nAero drinking bottle \nAllows hands-free hydration, reducing drag as there is no arm movement to interfere with airflow. Time saved: 30–45 secs.\nBar-end levers\nChanging gear without having to move from a tucked aero position means you stay in control, relaxed and fast. Time saved: 30 secs.\nTri suit \nSkin-tight Lycra has demonstrated 6% improvements in research. Time saved 30–45 secs (and quicker transitions).\nAero wheels \nA 50–80 mm deep aero front wheel and disc is the ultimate set-up but it’s a costly way to get faster. Time saved: 1–2 mins.\nLightweight aero frame \nMost of the gain is due to the aero position it allows, but the weight loss also helps a little. Time saved: 1–1:30 mins.\nHigh-quality tires\nThese reduce frontal area and rolling resistance, significant for riders with lower power output. Time saved: 2–4 mins.\nCycling shoes \nClipless, tri-specific shoes improve one's pedalling and cut transition time. Time saved: 30–60 secs.\nTotal time saved: 10–15 mins"

Listed at and , he threw and batted right-handed.\nBiography.\nNicknamed \"Smooth\", Lyons played minor league baseball from 1914 to 1928, except for 1916 when there is no record of him playing professionally. Lyons played only six games during the 1918 season, due to military service from May 1918 to January 1919. In 13 minor league seasons, he accrued a 124–163 win–loss record for seasons that records are available for.\nLyons' first major league stint came in September 1920 with the St. Louis Cardinals. His best outing was a complete game 4–2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies on September 22. With the Cardinals, Lyons pitched in seven games (two starts) registering a 2–1 record with a 3.09 earned run average (ERA) while striking out five batters in innings pitched.\nLyons returned to the major leagues in 1924 with the St. Louis Browns, when he pitched in 26 games (six starts). He had two complete game wins in June; one an 11–4 win over the Boston Red Sox, the other a 10–2 win over the Philadelphia Athletics. His record with the Browns was 3–2 with a 5.21 ERA and 25 strikeouts in innings pitched.\nLyons' major league pitching appearances yielded an overall 5–3 record with a 4.72 ERA in 33 games pitched. As a batter, he accrued a .222 batting average (6-for-27) with four RBIs. Defensively, he committed no errors in 39 total chances for a 1.000 fielding average.\nBorn in Bible Grove, Illinois, in 1891, Lyons served in the United States Army during World War I. He died at age 90 in Nevada, Missouri, and was interred there. The ballpark in the city of Nevada—used by the local high school and a M.I.N.K. Collegiate Baseball League team—is named Lyons Stadium in his honor."

Bids for the first four games have been made by 15 cities in 14 countries.\nThe bid process consists of two rounds. First, cities and national Olympic committees (NOCs) may show their interest and submit a preliminary bid, becoming applicant cities. Through analysis of the questionnaires, the IOC gave a weighted-average score to each city based on the scores obtained in each of the questionnaire's eleven themes: political and social support, general infrastructure, sports venues, Olympic Village, environment, accommodation, transport, security, past experience, finance, and legacy. IOC's executive committee then selects a short-list of candidate cities. The candidate cities are investigated by the IOC Evaluation Committee, who make an evaluation report. These submit a more extensive bid book and are subject to additional evaluation, which is presented to the IOC members. Voting occurs as an exhaustive ballot by mail, which may occur through multiple rounds until a single city holds a majority of the votes.

A native of Jersey City, New Jersey, he attended and earned three degrees from the University of Notre Dame.\nBrady was the eighth president of Jacksonville University (1989–96), after service as dean of both the university's College of Arts and Sciences and Davis College of Business. Prior to that, he held the department chair in economics at Old Dominion University and was a member of the economics faculty of his alma mater, Notre Dame.\nAs a baseball player, the , Brady was signed off his college campus as an undergraduate by the Detroit Tigers as a $37,500 \"bonus baby\" in 1955. Detroit's farm system director, John McHale, was a Notre Dame alumnus and Brady promised his father he would return to college to complete his education when he signed his contract. Under the terms of the bonus rule then in effect, however, Brady was forced to spend the first two years of his pro career on a Major League roster.\nNicknamed \"Diamond Jim\" because of his bonus status, Brady missed the 1955 season due to an injury, then made his MLB debut on May 12, 1956, hurling a perfect ninth inning against the Chicago White Sox in a 7–6 loss at Briggs Stadium. A week later, he pitched another scoreless inning against the Baltimore Orioles, but was treated roughly in his next four appearances, surrendering 20 earned runs on 15 hits and ten bases on balls in only 4 innings of work.\nHe made only those six appearances, all in relief, during the season, then was sent to the minors for good in 1957. He retired as an active player after appearing in eight games for the 1961 Knoxville Smokies of the Class A Sally League.\nAccording to Jacksonville University, as of 2011, Brady was an arbitrator in North Florida."

Selection of the host city is done at an IOC Session four to seven years prior to the tournament, in which the IOC members vote between candidate cities which have submitted bids. As of the selection of the 2018 Olympics, 23 games have been held in 20 cities in 11 countries. Bids have been made by 56 cities in 23 countries.\nThe bid process consists of two rounds.

IOC members from a candidate NOC may not vote in any round while their country remains in the election.\nThe first games were not subject to bids and awarded to Chamonix as part of Paris' bid for the 1924 Summer Olympics. Originally the host country of the Summer Olympics had the right to host the Winter Olympics as well, if they could provide a suitable host. The 1940 Olympics were originally awarded to Sapporo, but it and the 1944 Winter Olympics were ultimately canceled due to the Second World War. The 1976 Olympics were awarded to Denver, but in a 1972 referendum, voters rejected the games, and for the only time a city awarded the Games rejected them. IOC then offered them to Whistler, but a change of government meant they were no longer interested. Salt Lake City offered to host the games, but IOC finally chose Innsbruck instead. From 1994, Winter Olympics were held between Summer Olympic years. Starting with the 2004 Olympics, only the highest-rated cities are short-listed for the final IOC vote.\nInnsbruck, Lake Placid, and St. Moritz are the only cities to have hosted two games. Albertville, Grenoble, Nagano and Turin have never lost a bid. With six, Lake Placid has the most bids, followed by Cortina d'Ampezzo with five. Montreal and Jaca have both made four bids without any being successful. Helsinki, Minneapolis, Montreal and Munich have bid for both Summer and Winter Olympics; all but Minneapolis have succeeded at winning Summer bids, but none have held Winter Olympics. Canada and the United States have bid thirteen and twelve times respectively, with the US being awarded four and Canada two games. Other countries to host multiple games are France (3), Austria (2), Italy (2), Japan (2), Norway (2), and Switzerland (2). Sweden and Finland have bid eight and five times respectively, all unsuccessfully.\nBy year.\nThe following is a list of bids for the Winter Olympics, sorted by year. It consists of the year the games were held or scheduled to be held, the date the decision was made, the city and country which issued the bid, the votes at the IOC Session for each voting round, and the ultimate host of the games.

The general sense of 'a Traverse' is to cross, or cut across and in general mountaineering, a road or path traveled traverses the steep gradient of the face. In civil engineering, road bed cuttings (or 'traverses') dug by construction operations creating an navigable incline into a hillside traverse the slope, also cut across the gradient as does the skier, climber, or builder.\nClimbing.\nIn climbing, Traversing a climbing wall is a good warm-up exercise.\nWhen moving laterally, the technique of \"crossing through\" is more efficient than shuffling. In this, the limbs are crossed so that the moves are longer and more fluid. The longer extension requires coordination between the hands and the feet to avoid over-extension of the upper or lower part of the body.\nIf two climbers are roped together for protection, the leader should secure the rope both before and after a difficult move when traversing. This enables the following climber to remove the anchorage before making the difficult move while still having good security from the anchor point which was placed after the move."

The organization is based in the Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, and is made up of 34 countries.\nThe purpose of COTECC is to encourage, direct, organize, regulate, govern and disseminate the practice of tennis; organize, sponsor and / or run tournaments, championships, training programs and workshops for the National Tennis Federations of the Caribbean and Central America; and maintain affiliation with the ITF on behalf of the geographic area of the Caribbean and Central America.\nCOTECC is one of the six regional tennis divisions worldwide, together with the South American Tennis Confederation (Cosat), the African Tennis Confederation (CAT), the Asian Tennis Federation (ATF), the Tennis Federation of Oceania (OTF) and the European Tennis Association (TE).\nThe regional body has two Development Officers whose purpose is to continue raising the level of tennis in the region. One of them is Cecilia Ancalmo, from El Salvador, in charge of Central America and the Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean; and John Goede, from Suriname, responsible for the English, French and Dutch Caribbean nations.\nHistory.\nCOTECC was created in 1992 as one of the points discussed in the Annual General Meeting of the ITF held in La Romana, Dominican Republic, in which it was agreed to create a governing body for tennis that would unite the countries of Central America, the Spanish Caribbean and the English Caribbean.\nIt was that same year, in Mexico, the COTECC statutes were signed and also the Mexican Jesus Topete was selected as the first president of the Confederation for a period of two years.\nHowever, as the former president of the organism Gonzalo Mejía says, there were other organizations that preceded COTECC as tennis governing body in the area, although they never received recognition from the ITF. In 1968, as a result of the beginning of the Open Era, tennis was left out of the Olympics, which automatically meant that it was not an official sport in the Pan American or the Central American and Caribbean Games.\nThis situation resulted in several countries founding the Pan-American Tennis Confederation in 1971, which had the recognition of the national Olympic committees of all America, which produced the return of tennis to the Central Americans and the Caribbean Santo Domingo 74 and the Pan American Games of Mexico 75.\nMejía adds that for the year 1982, during Central American and Caribbean Games in Havana, Cuba, it formed the basis for creating the COTECC that we currently have: the Central American and Caribbean Confederation of Tennis, with a large part of the countries that make it up today.\nPresident.\nThe COTECC elections for the Steering Committee are held every two years at the Annual General Meeting, in which the member countries choose a president, two vice-presidents, two directors and each of the four heads of the subregions.\nThe current president is Persio Maldonado, from the Dominican Republic, who was re-elected last June for the period 2018–2020. In 2016, Maldonado assumed the presidency of the institution for the first time.\nMaldonado relies on the Salvadoran Enrique Molins, who was leading the regional body between 2000 and 2016, this being the longest period for a president in the history of COTECC.\nPrior to Molins and Maldonado were presidents Jesús Topete, from Mexico, (1992-1996), and Gonzalo Mejía, from the Dominican Republic, (1996-2000).\nAffiliated members.\nThese are the members of COTECC:"

        "title": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 (Coimbra)",
        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Coimbra were the joint 16th edition of the W.A.K.O. world championships and was the second event (the Belgrade event having been held a month previously). The championships were for amateur male and female kickboxers and martial artists, covering the following categories; Full-Contact, Semi-Contact, Musical Forms and Aero Kickboxing. In the contact kickboxing categories (Semi and Full), weight classes ranged from light bantamweight (51 kg/112 lbs) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg/200.6 lbs). The Musical Forms and Aero Kickboxing categories did not have weight classes but had different forms. More information on the categories, weight classes and rules is provided in the various sections below. In total there were around 600 competitors at the event, representing fifty countries from five continents, competing in forty-three competitions. The Coimbra championships were held at the Pavilhão Multiusos de Coimbra in Coimbra, Portugal from Monday, November 26 to Sunday, December 2, 2007.\nFull-Contact.\nFull-Contact is kickboxing where the intention is to defeat the opponent using legal techniques applying full force. Legal strikes include punches and kicks to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and foot/feet (sweeps). Attacks that are illegal include strikes to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and anywhere below the belt (except for foot sweeps). As with most forms of amateur competition, all fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.\nA minimum of six kicks must be thrown each round or points may be deducted by the referee. Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. The judges will score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. Illegal moves may result in points deduction or if repeated, disqualification. In the event of a draw after three rounds the judges will base the victor on who was stronger in the final round, or failing that will use their remarks from each round to deduce who wins. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on Full-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.\nAt Coimbra the men had twelve weight classes ranging from light bantamweight (51 kg/112.2 lbs) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg/200.2 lbs), while the women's had seven, ranging from bantamweight (51 kg/112.2 lbs) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg/154 lbs). By the end of the championships, the nation that dominated Full-Contact was Russia with an impressive haul of ten gold, four silvers and one bronze, in both the male and female categories.\nSemi-Contact.\nThis form of kickboxing is defined by the competitors trying to outscore one another with the use of light and well-controlled contact, with the emphasis being placed on delivery, technique and speed, using both legal hand and foot techniques. It is similar to Light-Contact kickboxing only that less force is used in Semi-Contact, with almost all fights won on points, although matches have been stopped by the referee due to a KO/TKO on rare occasions. Attacks are allowed to the head (front, side, back and forehead), torso (front and side) leg (foot sweeps only) and must be of reasonable force (not a push or a brush). Excessive force is prohibited as are attacks to the top of the head, back, top of shoulders, neck and below the belt (aside from foot sweeps) or any kicks using the heel (the sole of foot must be used instead). It is also illegal to grab an opponent or throw them to the ground. Semi-Contact is seen as a good starting position for fighters who want fight experience without the additional physicality of Full or (to a lesser extent) Light-Contact kickboxing. Despite the less physical nature all fighters are still required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves. \nFighters score the following points for landing a controlled strike on their opponent; punch, kick to body, foot sweep (1 point), kick to head, jumping kick to body (2 points), jumping kick to head (3 points). Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. In the event of a draw the match will be scored electronically. Victory can be achieved by points decision, knockout or technical knockout (both rare), abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (the other fighter is unable to participate). More detail on Semi-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.\nSemi-Contact uses slightly different weight classes from Full-Contact kickboxing. At Coimbra the men's Semi-Contact competition had nine weight classes ranging from 57 kg/125.4 lbs to over 94 kg/206.8 lbs, while the women's had six, ranging from 50 kg/110 lbs to over 70 kg/154 lbs. There was also a team event at the competition, involving three men and one woman for each of the participating nations, with the woman to be paired against another woman only. By the end of the championships, Hungary was the top nation in Semi-Contact with four gold, three silver and two bronze medals, in the male, female and team categories.\nMusical Forms.\nMusical Forms is a non-physical competition which involves the contestant fighting against imaginary opponents using Martial Arts techniques to music of their choice. There are no weight classes as with most other W.A.K.O. categories although there are separate male and female competitions and, unlike the contact categories, an individual country was allowed more than one competitor. There are four separate categories in Musical Forms:\nPoints can be deducted for routines that are too short or go past the allocated time. Points are also deducted for contestants who drop weapons, loss of synchronization with the music, lose balance, perform illegal moves such as western break dancing etc. The competitors are allowed three gymnastic moves per performance, any more results in a point(s) deduction. Disqualification can occur if too many errors occur. Points are awarded for successful form and technique (e.g. delivery of kicks and punches), balance, degree of difficulty involved in a move, synchronization and more. The winner of each category is scored after seven presentations with points scored out of ten for the performance. If a fighter is tied on points after the presentation they will share a spot (or medal). More information on Musical Forms and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. By the end of the championships, Russia was the strongest nation in Musical Forms having won four golds, four silvers and five bronzes in both the male and female categories.\nAero Kickboxing.\nAs with Musical Forms, Aero Kickboxing is a non physical competition, involving aerobic and kickboxing techniques in time to specifically selected music. This music must be between 135 and 155 b.p.m. and must not contain any swear words or inappropriate noises. There are no weight divisions like in other forms of kickboxing in W.A.K.O. but there are separate male, female and team categories, each split into 'with (aerobic) step' or 'without (aerobic) step', and, unlike the contact categories, an individual country was allowed more than one competitor, with the team event even having several teams from the same country. Each performance must be between 1.5 and 2 minutes long and be 70% kickboxing and 30% aerobics, with at least five kicks/punches per period (every 32 musical beats).\nPoints are deducted for any hesitation or loss of balance, insufficient number of kickboxing or aerobic techniques, touching the floor with any part of body other than the feet, over repetition of the same moves, and loss of synchronization with teammates in team competition. Competitors can be disqualified for inappropriate music (with swearing/unsuitable noises) or the wearing of sports bras. Points are rewarded for clean technique with difficulty of moves being taken into consideration and good synchronization with teammates in team competition. The winner of each category is scored after seven separate performances, with points scored between 7 and 10 for each performance. More information on Musical Forms and the rules can be found on the W.A.K.O. website. Hungary and Slovenia were joint top in Aero Kickboxing at the end of the championships, having won two golds and two silvers each.\nOverall Medals Standing (Top 5).\nThe top nation at the W.A.K.O. Amateur World Championships in Coimbra was Russia (who was also the top nation at the event held in Belgrade the previous month). The country gained fifteen golds, nine silvers and ten bronzes, across all categories, male and female."

After nine seasons in minor league baseball, Kern had an eight-game trial with the Kansas City Athletics during the season. He had signed with the team in 1954, when they were still based in Philadelphia. Kern attended Muhlenberg College, graduating in 1954.\nKern threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . He batted over .300 four times and hit 144 home runs during his minor-league career. In September 1962, at age 29, he was recalled by the Athletics after he batted .315 with 27 home runs and 97 runs batted in for the Triple-A Portland Beavers. Kern appeared in eight games played, batting 16 times with four hits. In his first MLB game, he pinch hit for Moe Drabowsky and singled off Dick Donovan of the Cleveland Indians. In his final MLB game, as the A's starting left fielder, he hit his lone Major League home run off future Baseball Hall of Fame pitcher (and United States Senator) Jim Bunning, then with the Detroit Tigers."

Contested over three days, from 7 to 9 December, it was the first time that women were allowed to compete in athletics events at the Games. A total of 28 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 5 by female athletes. The event was seen as a test event for the Athletics at the 2006 Asian Games, which Doha hosted the following year.\nThe competition featured some high level performances by a handful of elite athletes: former World Youth champions Belal Mansoor Ali and Yahya Al-Ghahes won the 1500 metres and 100 metres, respectively, while world silver medallist Mubarak Hassan Shami claimed the half marathon title. On the women's side, 2004 Olympian Ruqaya Al-Ghasra won the women's 100 m. In spite of this, many events featured only a small number of athletes and the overall standard of competition was relatively low.\nHost nation Qatar topped the medal table with eleven gold medals, ten silver medals and six bronze medal. Their tally was greatly buoyed by the performances of former Kenya distance runners, including event winners Gamal Belal Salem, Majed Saeed Sultan and Musa Amer Obaid. Kuwait had the second highest number of golds with five, while Iran had the second greatest overall haul (13 medals; four golds). Of the nations competing at the games, only Lebanon and Yemen did not win medals in the athletics.\nIt was later revealed that 3000 metres steeplechase bronze medalist Mohammed Khassaf of Iraq and 200 metres and women's relay gold medallist Munira Saleh failed drugs test at the event and were banned."

        "text": "Joseph Ambrose Murray (November 11, 1920 – October 19, 2001) was a pitcher who played in Major League Baseball during the season. Listed at 6' 0\", 165 lb., Murray batted and threw left-handed. He was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\nAt age 29, it had been a long journey to the major leagues for Joe Murray. The southpaw hurler debuted in 1940 with the Class-D Easton Yankees, an Eastern Shore League affiliate team of the New York Yankees. He would spend his next three seasons with three clubs, compiling a 35–25 record and a 3.70 earned run average in four full seasons, but his baseball career was interrupted in 1943 after he entered service in the United States Navy during World War II.\nFollowing his discharge in 1946, Murray was part of successive transactions between the Yankees, Washington Senators and Philadelphia Athletics organizations. In 1947, he led the Class-B Colonial League with a 2.34 ERA while going 12–7 in 22 pitching appearances. His most productive season came in 1950, when he posted a 20–14 record with a 2.94 ERA and was selected for the Florida International League All-Star team.\nFinally, Murray had his chance to play in the major leagues when he joined the last-place Athletics on August 17, 1950. He lost all three of his decisions in eight games (two starts), allowing 20 runs (19 earned) on 34 hits and 21 walks while striking out eight batters. He registered a 5.70 ERA in 30 innings of work.\nAfter his brief stint with the Athletics, Murray returned to the minors and pitched from 1951 through 1953. In an eleven-season career, he finished with a 111–113 mark and a 3.87 ERA in 344 games. He later managed the Wytheville Statesmen of the Appalachian League in 1954.\nWhen his baseball career ended, Murray went to work for Union Carbide and later worked as a construction company roofing contractor. He was a long-time resident of San Clemente, California, where he died at the age of 80."

        "title": "Australian cricket team in Australia in 1965–66",
        "text": "The 1965-66 Australians drew 1-1 with the touring England team in the 1965-66 Ashes series. They were strong in batting, but weak in bowling and by the end of the series had seven batsmen, an all-rounder, a wicket-keeper and only two specialist bowlers in the team, with the batsman helping out with their part-time bowling skills.\nThe Captain.\n\"Bobby Simpson was a physically compact, highly accomplished batsman with a striking penchant for compiling high scores...He was a pleasant, personable cricketer, and a captain with genuine feeling for his players. Those who watched him will never forget the masterly ease of his slip-catching.\"\nRobert Baddeley Simpson, better known as Bobby Simpson was a cricket prodigy who had a difficult time establishing himself as a Test batsman, taking 30 Tests to make his maiden Test century, 311 against England at Old Trafford in 1964. He had already made a number of big centuries in the Sheffield Shield for New South Wales and Western Australia and in the middle of his career made 159 in Pakistan, 201 in the West Indies, 225 against England and 159 in South Africa. He was a careful opener, but once established had a number of strokes and unlike his regular opening partner Bill Lawry was able to hit the ball attractively. He had been a leg-spinner in his youth and had taken 5/57 against England in 1962-63 and he took 5/59 against India in what was to be his last Test until his 1977 recall. His greatest talent was in the field and held 110 catches in only 62 Tests and was \"one of the greatest slip-fielders of all time. He had lightning-quick reflexes and it was rare indeed for a chance to go begging if the ball was anything like catchable.\" As a captain he was well liked, but more cautious than courageous. He held onto the Ashes with a 1-0 win in England in 1964 - his 762-minute triple century made sure that England would not recover the urn - and a 1-1 draw in 1965-66. He lost 2-1 in the West Indies in 1964-65 and 3-1 in South Africa in 1966-67 and his only other series victory was when he beat India 4-0 at home in 1967–68, when Simpson gave the captaincy to Bill Lawry after the Second Test. This poor record was caused by the weakness of the Australian bowling attack in the late 1960s, which relied heavily on the fast bowling of Garth McKenzie. Simpson first retired in 1968, but returned in 1977 in the midst of the Packer Crisis when Test players deserted regular cricket and Australia were left with a team of debutants and Jeff Thomson. Simpson had been playing grade cricket in the intervening years and returned as Australian captain, beating India 3-2 at home, but losing 3-1 in the West Indies. He asked the Australian Board of Control to promise his place in the 1978-79 Ashes series, but they refused and he took to broadcasting.\nBatting.\nAustralia had a long batting line up in the 1965-66 Ashes series and in the Fourth and Fifth Tests they had seven specialist batsmen, the all-rounder Tom Veivers and the wicket-keeper Wally Grout batting at number 9. Bobby Simpson and Bill Lawry were the best opening partnership in the world, being the only opening batsmen to have both made a double century in the same innings as they added a record 382 for the first wicket in the West Indies in 1964-65. Lawry was a \"tall, lanky, dour, watchful left-hander, and a better player than he looked...a great fighter, and a splendid resister in a corner\", who was once unfairly described as \"a corpse with pads on\". His 592 runs (84.57) in the series was the most in an Ashes series since Don Bradman's 680 runs (97.14) in 1946–47 and his three centuries were the most since Arthur Morris made three in 1948.\nThe old hand Grahame Thomas and the tall and ungainly Ian Redpath were used as replacement openers when Simpson was ill or injured and Thomas was kept on after the captain returned, but made little impression. Redpath would later become the main opening batsmen in Ian Chappell's Australian powerful teams of the early 1970s. The imaginative strokemaker Doug Walters was the real find of the series, making 155 on debut and 115 in the Second Test. Later he was found to have a weakness against fast bowling and English bowling conditions, but this was not a problem he faced in 1965-66 and he soared. Bob Cowper made 307 in the Fifth Test, the highest Test century in Australia until Matthew Hayden made 380 against Zimbabwe in 2002–03. A tall, correct left-handed batsmen who was dropped for the Fourth Test because he batted too slowly, he averaged an impressive 75.78 in home Tests but only 33.33 overseas and the difference of 42.45 is a Test match record. Vice-captain Brian Booth a \"modest, unobtrusive stylist\" failed to make any runs and was dropped when he lost the Third Test in Simpson's absence. Peter Burge was another veteran, a heavyweight front-foot batsman nicknamed 'Burge the Bulge' and whose four Test centuries were all made against the England in times of crisis. He made 120 to save the Second Test, but was dropped due to his otherwise poor form. The young Keith Stackpole and Ian Chappell were brought into the team at the end of the series, but their catching proved to be of more importance than their batting. Tom Veivers was an off-spinning all rounder who averaged 31.26 and made seven 50s in only 21 Tests. Wally Grout was not the best batting wicketkeeper, but he liked to swing the bat about and could make vital runs.\nBowling.\n\"Graham McKenzie - with 100 Test wickets to him name before the series started and at the age of 24 - was a fine bowler with a model action, and he and Neil Hawke made a good opening pair, as they had done in England. But they scarcely got any support worthy of the name.\"\nAfter the retirement of Richie Benaud and Alan Davidson the Australian with the lowest bowling average was Doug Walters at 29.08 and seven England batsmen averaged over 40.00 in the series. Their best bowler was Garth McKenzie, a 6'2\" gentle giant he had a knack of taking wickets on flat batting tracks and at 24 who had just become the youngest bowler to take a 100 test wickets. Strangely he was not an automatic choice for Australia and was dropped in favour of Peter Allan in the First Test and almost in the Fourth. Allan had taken 10/61 in the Sheffield Shield, the third best innings return in Australia, and was recalled for the Fourth Test, but was injured and McKenzie returned to take a match-winning 6/48. McKenzie's new-ball partner was Neil Hawke a strong fast-medium bowler who played Aussie Rules football, but like McKenzie ended his career with a Test average of 29. After this the quality of Australian bowling fell away sharply. Alan Connolly was a decent fast-medium bowler, but he failed in the series and in the end Australia used the batsmen Doug Walters as their first change bowler. Similarly the leg-spin of Bobby Simpson, Keith Stackpole and Ian Chappell was pressed into action, as was the off-spin of Bob Cowper and in the Fourth and Fifth Tests Australia only used three specialist bowlers. Peter Philpott took 5/90 in the First Test with his leg-spin, but fell away and David Sincock's slow left-arm wrist-spin failed despite their rarity value. Tom Veivers was a useful lower order batsmen, but his off-spin took few wickets and he could only be used for containment.\nFielding.\nWith their baseball experience Australia were traditionally a stronger fielding side than England. This was Wally Grout's last Test series and at the time his 187 dismissals in 51 Tests was second only to Godfrey Evans's 219 in 91 Tests. He was 30 when he played in his first Test on the 1957-58 South African tour, when he held a record 6 catches in an innings and soon established himself as the best wicket-keeper in the world. Bobby Simpson was one of the greatest slip fielders in cricket, Bill Lawry and Grahame Thomas were noted outfielders and Doug Walters was good anywhere. Ian Chappell and Keith Stackpole took some fine catches in the last two Tests and Garth McKenzie took 4 catches in the outfield.\nFirst Test - Brisbane.\n\"See Main Article - 1965-66 Ashes series\"\nSecond Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1965-66 Ashes series\"\nThird Test - Sydney.\n\"See Main Article - 1965-66 Ashes series\"\nFourth Test - Adelaide.\n\"See Main Article - 1965-66 Ashes series\"\nFifth Test - Melbourne.\n\"See Main Article - 1965-66 Ashes series\""

Finland won the tournament for the second time defeating Sweden 6–1 in the final.\nBefore the start of the tournament, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of 15 skaters and two goaltenders and a maximum of 20 skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to add additional players to their roster, for a maximum of 25. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.\nTo have qualified for the national team under IIHF rules, a player must have met several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to change which national team they represent, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player was required to have played two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may happen only once in the player's life.\nViktor Fasth of Sweden was named the tournament's most valuable player and top goaltender by the IIHF directorate. Canadian Alex Pietrangelo was named the top defenceman and Jaromír Jágr of the Czech Republic was selected as the top forward. Finland's Jarkko Immonen was the tournament's leading scorer with 12 points and Petri Vehanen was the leading goaltender with a save percentage of 0.954."

The event was won by Johan Harmenberg of Sweden, the nation's first victory in the event and first medal of any color in the men's individual épée since 1924. Silver went to Ernő Kolczonay of Hungary, extending the nation's podium streak to four Games despite the retirement of three-time medalist Győző Kulcsár. Philippe Riboud of France took bronze.

        "text": "The men's sabre was one of eight fencing events on the fencing at the 1980 Summer Olympics programme. It was the nineteenth appearance of the event. The competition was held from 24 to 25 July 1980. 30 fencers from 12 nations competed. Nations had been limited to three fencers each since 1928. The event was won by defending champion Viktor Krovopuskov of the Soviet Union, the nation's third consecutive victory in the event (a streak that would be broken by the Soviet-led boycott four years later). Krovopuskov was the third man to successfully defend a sabre title and the 10th man to win two medals of any color in the event. His teammate Mikhail Burtsev took silver. Imre Gedővári's bronze medal returned Hungary to the podium after a one-Games absence broke an eleven-Games streak.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event, which is the only fencing event to have been held at every Summer Olympics. Five of the six finalists from 1976 returned: gold medalist Viktor Krovopuskov of the Soviet Union, silver medalist (and 1972 bronze medalist) Vladimir Nazlymov of the Soviet Union, fourth-place finisher Ioan Pop of Romania, fifth-place finisher Mario Aldo Montano of Italy, and sixth-place finisher Michele Maffei of Italy. Bronze medalist (and 1972 gold medalist) Viktor Sidyak's place on the Soviet team had been filled by Mikhail Burtsev. The three world championships since the last Games had been won by Hungarian Pál Gerevich (1977) and Soviets Krovopuskov (1978) and Nazlymov (1979), the latter of whom had also won in 1975. The American-led boycott had little effect on the top of the favorites list, with the Soviet Union dominating, other Eastern Bloc countries such as Hungary, Poland, Romania being perpetually strong (with Bulgarian twins Vasil Etropolski and Khristo Etropolski making a case to add that nation), and the strongest Western nation in the event (Italy) participating under the Olympic flag. Indeed, the only nation that had ever won a men's sabre medal to boycott the 1980 Games was the United States—which had taken silver in St. Louis 1904 by default, with only one Cuban fencer (who took gold) making the event international.\nKuwait and East Germany each made their debut in the men's sabre. Italy made its 17th appearance in the event, most of any nation, having missed the inaugural 1896 event and the 1904 St. Louis Games.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1980 tournament continued to use a mix of pool and knockout rounds. The competition included two pool rounds, followed by a double-elimination knockout round, finishing with a final pool round. In each pool round, the fencers competed in a round-robin.\nBouts in the round-robin pools were to 5 touches; bouts in the double-elimination round were to 10 touches. Repechages were not used in the first two rounds, but were used to determine medalists if necessary in the final."

        "title": "Modern competitive archery",
        "text": "Modern competitive archery involves shooting arrows at a target for accuracy and precision from a set distance or distances. This is the most popular form of competitive archery worldwide and is called target archery. A form particularly popular in Europe, North America, and South America is field archery, shot at targets generally set at various distances in a wooded setting. There are also several other lesser-known and historical forms, as well as archery novelty games.\nThe World Archery Federation (WA, also and formerly known as FITA from the French \"Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc\"), composed of 156 national federations and other archery associations, is the governing body recognized by the International Olympic Committee. Various other large organizations exist with different rules.\nTarget archery.\nModern competitive target archery is often governed by the World Archery Federation, abbreviated as WA (sometimes also referred to as FITA, from its former French name of \"Fédération Internationale de Tir à l'Arc\"). Olympic rules are derived from WA rules. \nTarget archery competitions may be held indoors or outdoors. Indoor distances are . Outdoor distances range from . Competition is divided into \"ends\" of 3 or 6 arrows. After each end, the competitors walk to the target to score and retrieve their arrows. Archers have a set time limit in which to shoot their arrows. 3 arrows are shot in 2 minutes, and 6 in 4 minutes.\nTargets are marked with 10 evenly spaced concentric rings, which have score values from 1 through 10 assigned to them. In addition, there is an inner 10 ring, sometimes called the X ring. This becomes the 10 ring at indoor compound competitions. Outdoors, it serves as a tiebreaker with the archer scoring the most X's winning. Archers score each end by summing the scores for their arrows. Line breakers, an arrow just touching a scoring boundary line, will be awarded the higher score.\nIn the past, most targets in competitive archery use some kind of stalks of grain or grass and may be constructed of marsh grass woven into a rope then wrapped around into a target. \nHowever, in modern times, most archery targets are made of synthetic foam, or woven plastic bags stuffed with cloth.\nDifferent rounds and distances use different size target faces. These range from ( WA Indoor) to ( and WA, used in Olympic competition).\nField archery.\nField archery involves shooting at targets of varying (and sometimes unmarked) distance, often in rough terrain.\nThree common types of rounds (in the NFAA) are the field, hunter, and animal. A round consists of 28 targets in two units of 14 (until the early 60's two rounds of 28 were shot for 56 targets). Field rounds are at 'even' distances up to (some of the shortest are measured in feet instead), using targets with a black bullseye (5 points), a white center (4) ring, and black outer (3) ring. Hunter rounds use 'uneven' distances up to , and although scoring is identical to a field round, the target has an all-black face with a white bullseye. Children and youth positions for these two rounds are closer, no more than , respectively. Animal rounds use life-size 2D animal targets with 'uneven' distances reminiscent of the hunter round. The rules and scoring are also significantly different. The archer begins at the first station of the target and shoot their first arrow. If it hits, they do not have to shoot again. If it misses, they advance to station two and shoots a second arrow, then to station three for a third if needed. Scoring areas are vital (20, 16, or 12) and nonvital (18, 14, or 10) with points awarded depending on which arrow scored first. Again, children and youth shoot from reduced range.\nOne goal of field archery is to improve the technique required for bowhunting in a more realistic outdoor setting, but without introducing the complication and guesswork of unknown distances. As with golf, fatigue can be an issue as the athlete walks the distance between targets across sometimes rough terrain.\nIFAA Field and International rounds are used in European Professional Archery competition.\nOther modern competitions.\nThe following are listed on the WA website. These competitions are not as popular as the two listed above, but they are competed internationally.\n3D archery.\n3D archery is a subset of field archery focusing on shooting at life-size models of game and is popular with hunters. It is most common to see unmarked distances in 3D archery, as the goal is to accurately recreate a hunting environment for competition.\nThough the goal is hunting practice, hunting broadheads are not used, as they would tear up the foam targets too much. Normal target or field tips, of the same weight as the intended broadhead, are used instead.\nIn the past 10 years 3D archery has taken new light with a competitive edge. There is a whole new group of competitions that are no longer considered hunting practice. Competitions are held in many U.S. states with the totals from each state being added together to crown a single winner within each division. Some competitors will travel thousands of miles (kilometers) a year to compete to try and claim the world title in 3D archery. This competitive style has been growing in many other countries and should continue with strong support for many years to come.\nThe major 3D archery groups are the IBO (International Bowhunting Organization) and the ASA (American Shooters Association) are primarily based in Eastern United States. They each have different rules and scoring methods. They host a number of competitive shoots across the Eastern United States. There are several classes in each organization that range from hunter all the way up to professional classes. Each class shoots at maximum yardages that vary by class.\nClout archery (G.N.A.S. rules in the United Kingdom).\nSimilar to target archery, except that the archer attempts to drop arrows at long range ( for the men and for women; there are shorter distances for juniors depending on age) into a group of concentric circular scoring zones on the ground surrounding a marker flag. Traditional clout archery, up to Elizabethan times, was shot at 'twelve score', . The flag is square and is fixed to a stick. The flag should be as near to the ground as is practicable. Archers shoot 'ends' of six arrows then, when given the signal to do so, archers proceed to the target area. A Clout round usually consists of 36 arrows. Clout tournaments are usually a 'Double Clout' round (36 arrows shot twice). They can be shot in one direction (one way) or both directions (two way). All bow types may compete (longbows, recurve, barebow and compound).\nCrossbow archery (IAU rules internationally).\nThe International Crossbow-shooting Union (Internationale Armbrustschutzen Union – IAU) was founded in Landshut, Germany, on June 24, 1956, as the world governing body for crossbow target shooting. The IAU supervises World, Continental and International crossbow shooting championships in 3 disciplines; Match-crossbow, Match-crossbow and Field-crossbow archery. IAU World Championships take place every two years with Continental Championships on intervening years. Other International and IAU-Cup events take place annually.\nField-crossbow archery was first adopted by the IAU during their General Assembly at Frütigen, Switzerland in 1977. Since then the sport has become the most popular, in terms of worldwide activity, of the IAU's three target crossbow disciplines. A feature of this sport is that many crossbow archers make their own equipment. By following the detailed guidelines issued by the IAU's Technical Committee it is possible to construct a field crossbow from locally available archery materials and target shooting accessories. The IAU's Field regulations call for the wearing of light-weight sports clothing, thereby eliminating the need for specialized (and costly) shooting clothing. Shooting takes place on open sports fields or in sports halls using portable archery target buttresses, once again avoiding the need for the expense of permanent shooting ranges (subject to IAU and local safety regulations being met).\nCrossbow archers shoot from the standing position and they must draw the bow string by hand without mechanical assistance. At outdoor competitions Bolts (arrows) are shot in \"ends\" (series) of three at multi-coloured 10-zone archery target faces. A time limit of three minutes is allowed per three shots. After a sound signal from the official in charge of shooting, all competitors walk forward together to score and collect their bolts from the targets. This sequence is repeated until the completion of the competition 'round'.\nEquipment – Field-crossbows are designed to specifications laid-down by the International Crossbow-shooting Union (IAU). These rules limit the power, weight and physical dimensions of equipment for use in archery-style competition. Other restrictions include the use of mechanical triggers and open sights only. The bowstring has to be drawn by hand without the use of mechanical assistance. The materials used in construction include laminated hardwoods, aluminium alloy and composites. The prod, or bow, is usually made from laminated carbon-fibre or glass-fibre which is fitted with a bowstring made from synthetic fibres. The maximum permitted draw weight is at a maximum power stroke of . Shooting a bolt this set up will generate an initial velocity of around . Field crossbow bolts are made from tubular aluminium or carbon-fibre archery shaft materials.\nThe majority of the crossbows used in this sport are custom made in small quantities, often by the archers themselves.\nIAU Championships Timeline – 1958 1st European Match-crossbow Championships Gent Belgium, 1979 1st World Match-crossbow Championships Linz Austria, 1982 1st World Field-crossbow Championships Mikkeli Finland, 1989 1st European Field-crossbow Championships Wolverhampton England, 1992 1st Asian Field-crossbow Championships Tainan Taiwan ROC.\nFlight archery.\nIn flight archery, the aim is to shoot the greatest distance; accuracy or penetrating power are not relevant. It requires a large flat area such as an aerodrome; the Ottoman Empire established an \"arrow field\" (Ok-Meidan) in Istanbul and there were others in several major cities. Turkish flight archery astonished early modern Europeans, whose wooden longbows and heavy arrows had much shorter maximum ranges; in 1795 Mahmoud Effendi, a secretary at the Turkish Embassy in London, made a shot of on Finsbury Fields, and reportedly apologised for an indifferent performance by Turkish standards.\nModern rules have flight archers shooting in various classes and weights. Generally they shoot six arrows at each \"end\" and then search for all of them. Only four ends are usual in one shoot (as per UK rules – in the US only one end is permitted). At the end of the shoot, archers stay by or mark their furthest arrows while judges and their assistants measure the distances achieved.\nFlight archery relies on the finest in performance equipment, optimized for the single purpose of greater range, using various types of bows (some unusual such as foot bows). The search for better flight archery equipment has led to many developments in archery equipment in general, such as the development of carbon arrows.\nFlight archery arrows are highly specialized. They are very short (Mahmoud Effendi's was only ), so that the point of the arrow is inside the arc of the fully drawn bow, requiring a support projecting back from the bow towards the archer to keep the arrow in position, or the use of a 'siper' (Turkish) on the bow hand/wrist on which to rest the arrow. Also, the shafts are 'barrelled', tapering towards both ends from the middle, to reduce both weight and air resistance.\nSki archery.\nAn event very similar to the sport of biathlon except a recurve bow is used in place of a gun. The athletes ski around a cross-country track and there are two stances in which the athlete must shoot the targets: kneeling and standing. During competition the skis may not be removed at any time. The athlete may unfasten the ski when shooting in the kneeling position but must keep the foot in contact with the ski. The shooting distance is and the targets in diameter. In certain events, for every missed target, the athlete must ski one penalty loop. The loop is long. In summer or regions with little snow, the European run archery is a mentionable alternative.\nTraditional competitions.\nThe following are not listed on the WA website but are competitions that have a long tradition in their respective countries.\nBeursault.\nA traditional northern French and Belgian archery contest. Archers teams shoot alternately at two targets facing each other, away. A perpendicular array of wooden walls secures a path parallel to the shooting range. After each round, the archers take their own arrow and shoot directly in the opposite direction (thus having opposite windage). One always shoots the same arrow, supposedly the best built, as it was difficult in medieval times to have constant arrow quality. The round black-and-white target mimics the size of a soldier: its diameter is shoulder-wide, the center is heart-sized.\nPopinjay (or Papingo).\nA form of archery originally derived from shooting birds on church steeples. Popinjay is popular in Belgium, and in Belgian Clubs internationally but little known elsewhere. Traditionally, archers stand within of the bottom of a mast and shoot almost vertically upwards with 'blunts' (arrows with rubber caps on the front instead of a point), and 'flu-flu' fletchings (very large, wound round the shaft to quickly reduce speed and distance of flight) the object being to dislodge any one of a number of wooden 'birds'. These birds must be one Cock, four Hens, and a minimum of twenty-four Chicks. A Cock scores 5 points when hit and knocked off its perch; a Hen, 3; and a Chick, 1 point. A horizontal variation with Flemish origins also exists and is also practiced in Canada and the United States\nA Papingo is also hosted during the summer in Scotland by the Ancient Society of Kilwinning Archers. The archers shoot at a wooden bird suspended from the steeple of Kilwinning Abbey. Here only one bird is the target, and the archers take it in turn to shoot with a longbow until the \"bird\" is shot down.\nRoving marks.\nRoving marks is the oldest form of competitive archery, as practiced by Henry VIII. The archers will shoot to a \"mark\" then shoot from that mark to another mark. A mark is a post or flag to be aimed at. As with clout a rope or ribbon is used to score the arrows. In the Finsbury Mark the scoring system is 20 for hitting the mark, 12 for within ~, 7 points for within the next ~ and 3 points for within the next ~. \"Hoyles\" are marks that are chosen at the time from the variety of debris, conspicuous weeds, and so on found in most outdoor areas. As the distances have to be estimated this is good practice for bowhunting, and it requires minimal equipment.\nWand shoot.\nA traditional English archery contest. Archers take turns shooting at a vertical strip of wood, the wand, usually about high and wide. Points are awarded for hitting the strip. As the target is a long vertical strip this competition allows for more errors in elevation, however since no points are awarded for near misses the archer's windage accuracy becomes more important. The wand shoot is, in some respects, similar to the traditional Cherokee game of cornstalk shooting.\nOther competitions.\nArchers often enjoy adding variety to their sport by shooting under unusual conditions or by imposing other special restrictions or rules on the event. These competitions are often less formalized and are more or less considered as games. Some forms include the broadhead round, bionic and running bucks, darts, archery golf, night shooting, and turkey tester.\nHistorical reenactment.\nArchery is popularly used in historical reenactment events. This sort of event usually combines education of the audience about aspects of archery (such as the bow, arrows, and practice drill), combined with a demonstration or competition of archery in the style most favored by the period on display, generally in period costume.\nArchery education.\nA relatively new program has developed in U.S. schools called the National Archery in the Schools Program (NASP). In this students use Genesis bows (a compound-style bow without a let-off, made by a subsidiary of major bow manufacturer Mathews Archery). Students or teams who want to can also go to state and national tournaments to compete against other schools. NASP was formed in 2001 as the Kentucky Archery in the Schools Program, with the state's Departments of Education and Fish and Wildlife Resources teaming with Mathews Archery. The program was formally launched in 2002 in 21 middle schools, with a stated goal of enrolling 120 schools within 3 years. This goal was reached within the program's first year, and interest from other states led to the state's name being replaced by \"National\". As of 2023, NASP lists program coordinators in the following jurisdictions:\nMany sportsman's clubs and similar establishments throughout the US and other countries offer archery education programs for those 20 and younger. These programs are commonly referred to as Junior Olympic Archery Development Programs, or simply JOAD. There are over 250 JOAD Clubs recognized by USA Archery.\n4-H is also offering archery as an activity for those under 18. Usually members have to have certain requirements for the bows they shoot (ex. use a Genesis Bow, no sights, no mechanical release aids, etc.). Members of archery 4-H clubs and those who use archery as their project can compete in target archery and field archery competitions.\nArchery with humans as targets, or very near the target.\nDemonstrations of archery skill are sometimes featured as entertainment in circuses or Wild West shows. Sometimes these acts feature a performer acting as a human \"target\" (strictly speaking they are not the target as the objective of the archer is to narrowly miss them, however they are frequently referred to as human targets). Archery in this context is sometimes known as one of the \"impalement arts\", a category which also includes knife throwing and sharpshooting demonstrations. Apache boys were trained to protect themselves by giving them a shield and having several warriors shoot at them with blunt arrows, which can still do severe damage.\nIn some recreational groups, a form of archery known as combat archery is practiced, where several archers divided into \"lights\" and \"heavies\", namely those wearing armour or not, shoot at each other with cushion-tipped arrows from low-powered longbows, with a maximum draw-weight of . The rules of combat archery dictate that no archer may shoot at a light, however all may shoot at a heavy. Combat archery can be an interesting challenge for participants, as it involves shooting at moving targets, and can be used to re-create battles. In Australia, it is more common for 'lights' to wear enough protection that they can shoot at each other as well.\nIt is important to note the strict separation between archery practised as a competitive sport and archery as an impalement art. For example, organising bodies for competitive archery prohibit activity that involves deliberate shooting in the general direction of a human being. The separation between the worlds of competition archery and the impalement arts is more marked than that between, for example, knife throwing as a sport and as an entertainment. While some competition knife throwers have also performed circus acts and there are official organisations that embrace both worlds, there is little or no evidence of such crossover in archery, with perhaps the sole exception of reenactment groups (e.g. Society for Creative Anachronism), where archers can both compete in a tournament (target archery) and participate in combat archery, shooting with light bows and special safety arrows at well armoured warriors (often knights).\nHowever archery involving a person in the vicinity of the target is a particularly dangerous practice and, even with very experienced performers, there have been cases of very serious injury.\nAnother situation where archery features as an entertainment is in its portrayal in movies. Howard Hill used his extraordinary accuracy for the archery in the movie \"The Adventures of Robin Hood\" (1938) starring Errol Flynn. He used a heavy hunting bow to hit small reinforced target areas on the chests of actors in motion. Hill also performed stunts such as shooting an apple held by a volunteer and shooting a stone as it was thrown in the air. Some of his stunts can be seen in the short film \"Cavalcade of Archery\" (1946)."

        "text": "John Giordano (born c. 1944) is a former ice hockey coach. He was the head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team from 1980 to 1984.\nEarly years.\nGiordano attended Notre Dame High School, a Catholic high school located in the Detroit suburb of Harper Woods, Michigan. He graduated in 1961 and later graduated from Wayne State University in Detroit.\nHockey coach at Harper Woods Notre Dame.\nGiordano returned to Harper Woods Notre Dame High School as a teacher and hockey coach. He was the hockey coach at Notre Dame from 1969 to 1979. He led the Notre Dame hockey team to a Michigan state championship in 1972. While at Notre Dame, he coached future NHL player John Blum. Actor Dave Coulier also played hockey for Giordano in the 1970s. Coulier later recalled: \"Giordano wasn't real happy when I made the guys laugh. He was very serious. Not a great combination with my constantly goofing-around personality. We had team curfews, haircuts, and if you didn't wear a suit to the games, you were benched.\"\nHockey coach at Michigan.\nIn 1979, Giordano was hired as an assistant hockey coach at the University of Michigan working under head coach Dan Farrell. Giordano was reunited at Michigan with John Blum, who had joined the Wolverines after graduating from Notre Dame High School. During the 1979-1980 hockey season, Giordano was in charge of the Wolverines' power play. Giordano was credited with molding the unit into \"the most potent power play in the country,\" scoring on 40% of power play opportunities.\nIn the spring of 1980, Farrell resigned as Michigan's head coach and was replaced by former Wolverine hockey star Wilf Martin. In the fall of 1980, the Michigan hockey team became embroiled in two major controversies.\nFirst, a hazing scandal dominated press coverage of the team in October. Veteran players reportedly forced a freshman player to drink large quantities of gin, vodka and beer, stripped him of his clothes, shaved his body from the neck down, covered him with jam, eggs and cologne, dumped him in the trunk of a car, and left him nearly unconscious in freezing weather. This was later found not to be true and the players actually returned the player, (J T Todd) to his dorm. Todd, who was walk-on from Detroit left the team. \nSecond, head coach Martin developed health problems, reported in the press to be an emotional disorder, during the exhibition season. Martin coached only two games during the 1980-1981 season, and announced his resignation in late November 1980.\nGiordano took over, initially as interim head coach, for a Michigan hockey team in crisis. Giordano was praised for his efforts in leading the team to a 23-17 record during the 1980-1981 season. \"The Michigan Daily\" noted:\"The Wayne State graduate was faced with a very adverse set of circumstances from the outset, including the loss of Michigan's top three scorers, being picked to finish last in the WCHA by pre-season pollsters, and extremely negative publicity surrounding the hazing incident.\"\nAthletic director Don Canham added, \"He took over in a bad situation and he's done a remarkably good job.\" Giordano was named permanent head coach in early February 1981. At the end of the 1980-1981 season, he was named collegiate Coach of the Year by \"The Hockey News\", WCHA Coach of the Year by \"The Denver Post\", and WCHA Co-Coach of the Year with John MacInnes by the vote of WCHA coaches.\nIn Giordano's second year as head coach, the Michigan hockey team moved from the highly competitive Western Collegiate Hockey Association (\"WCHA\") to the less-competitive Central Collegiate Hockey Association (\"CCHA\"). With the change in conferences, \"the conventional wisdom was that the Wolverines would dominate the new circuit behind their successful young coach.\" Instead, the Wolverines finished in fourth place in the CCHA during the 1981-1982 season with a record of 18-15-5.;\nThe team continued to move in the wrong direction in Giordano's third and fourth years as head coach, finishing in ninth place in the CCHA both years with records of 14-22-0 and 14-22-1.\nGiordano's position as head coach was further undermined by lagging attendance (Michigan averaged approximately 3,000 fans per game during Giordano's final two years as head coach) and a players' mutiny. Giordano had a reputation as a disciplinarian. Among other things, he strictly enforced curfews and ordered extra 6 a.m. practices when the team failed to perform. He was also alleged to have stripped seven players of their scholarships. In the spring of 1984, all 22 Michigan hockey players signed a petition listing their grievances and stating that Giordano was \"an embarrassment to all of us in front of other coaches and players.\" Athletic director Don Canham later recalled:\"I never talk to players about their coaches. I coached myself, and I know enough not to do that. But when all 22 players walked into my office the second time with a signed petition to say this situation is intolerable – well, I just had to let him go. He just never could get along with the players.\"\nIn his history of the Michigan hockey program, historian John U. Bacon noted: \"In reporting the decision, the \"Michigan Daily\" described Giordano as being 'very unpopular with the players, parents, fans and alumni' – which didn't leave many in his corner.\"\nGiordano was replaced as the head coach of the Michigan men's ice hockey team by Red Berenson, who retired from the position in 2017 after 33 seasons.\nHead coaching record.\nCollege.\n†&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Baseball in Palau",
        "text": "The sport of baseball is widely played in Palau, having been introduced by the Japanese during their occupation of the island nation. The highest level of league play in Palau in represented by Palau Major League (PML), which is overseen by the Belau Baseball Federation. The country is represented in international play by the Palau national baseball team.\nThe PML plays its games at the Asahi Field in Koror during a season lasting from January to April. No admission fee is charged for games. As of 2002 there were seven teams in the PML in one division. \nHistory.\n1914–1944: Japanese occupation.\nBaseball was first brought to Palau by the Japanese, who annexed the islands from Germany in 1914 and controlled them until losing the Battle of Peleliu in November 1944. One noted early promoter of baseball on the islands was Motoji Kono, who worked for the Imperial Japanese government on Palau from 1922 to 1929. He is credited with a foundational role in Palauan baseball for his work teaching Palauan men the basic skill sets and rules necessary to play the game, as well as being an energetic promoter of the sport, primarily from 1925 onwards. Most Palauan players in the 1920s were employed with the Japanese administration on the island.\nIn 1927 and 1928, a team of top Palauan players dubbed the \"All Palau Team\" played an annual series against a team composed of Japanese administrators. Although the Japanese won the first series, the All Palau team took 1928 match, leading the Japanese to segregate baseball on the island so that Palauans and Japanese players competed amongst themselves but not against each other.\n1945–1959: PML's early years.\nAmerican soldiers who occupied Palau at the end of and following World War II further promoted the game on the island. American soldiers provided endurance training and helped develop the islanders' pitching and fielding, particularly working to cultivate their infield skills.\nThe PML was founded in 1947, with the league culminating in the All-Palau Baseball Championship. A team from Peleliu was dominant in the postwar years, winning seven titles between 1947 and 1957. Peleliu suffered a notable defeat in the 1955 All-Palau Baseball Championship to a team of students from Koror Intermediate School.\n1960–1969: first international success.\nPeleliu won three championships in the 1960s: in 1960, 1961 and 1969. The team hasn't won a PML championship since 1969. In 1962, the Airai Comets won the PML championship for the first time, defeating the Ngardmau Cardinals. In the same year, a team of Palauan all-stars secured the nation's first success in international competition, winning a three-game set against a team of Guamanian all-stars 2–0. Palau was the visiting team for the series, which was held at Chief Quipuha Park.\nThe team was a sensation upon its arrival in Palau, where they were hosted at the Kebtol'l Bai (double bai) in Koror. Bai is the local Palauan name for the steep-roofed shelter built as a meeting place for the village elders. Chiefs from all the clans in Palau were present for a feast held in the team's honor.\nIn 1963, Palau Vocational School defeated Ngardmau to become the first student team to win the All-Palau Championship since 1955. The 1963 trophy is still kept in the trophy case at Palau Community College (PCC).\nA team of Palauan all-stars participated in further international competition in 1963, defeating a team from Xavier High School on Chuuk and winning a three-game series against a team of Pohnpei all-stars, two games to one. The final game narrowly avoided a rainout that would have led to a Pohnpei victory as Palau only pulled ahead in the late innings. As such, much credit for the victory was given to the Palauan team magician for overcoming the spells of the Pohnpeiian magician.\nFor the 1966 season, the PML contained ten teams divided into two, five team leagues. The Palau League contained Palau High School, Melekeok, Ngaremlengui, Peleliu A, and Airai. The Territorial League contained the Ngaraard Red Torch, Ngiwal, Koror, Aimeliik, and Peleliu B. However, the number and identity of the teams that participated in the PML varied significantly from year to year.\nThe Ngardmau Cardinals won the 1967 All Palau Baseball Championship, defeating team Asahi. The team won again in 1968, and went on to defeat a team of Palauan all-stars in the same year. The PML had seven teams in one division for the 1968 season. The competing teams were the Cardinals, Asahi, the Red Torch, Ngarametal, Ngarabelod, Ngarchelong and Peleliu. Peleliu won the 1969 championship, going 8–2 over the course of the regular season. The Palauan National Baseball Team participated in the 1969 Micronesian Olympic Games in Saipan.\n1970–1979: Red Torch dominate.\nThere are few existing records chronicling the PML in the 1970s, but the Red Torch appear to have dominated the decade. The team won the All-Palau Baseball Championship in 1970, 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1979. Meyuns won the championship in 1971, and Palau High School won in 1972. Meyuns repeated in 1975. Asahi field also underwent a renovation at some point the 1970s that included covered bleachers.\nIn 1973, a lawsuit was brought by the team from Ngaremlengui against the Aimeliik team for a game that Ngaremlengui won in the bottom of the ninth that the manager of the Aimeliik team felt should have concluded in the top of the ninth due to time limitations. The Parks Board ruled in favor of Aimeliik, leading Ngaremlengui to file suit against the decision.\n1980–1989: rise of the Airai Aces.\nThe 1981 PML season was canceled to allow the Palauan national team time to prepare for the 1981 Ambassadors Memorial baseball tournament in Guam. The tournament was played from May 22 to May 31, and in addition to the team from Palau included the Ponape All-Stars, who represented all the Federated States of Micronesia, Athletes in Action Ambassadors, the University of Guam Tritons, and the APL Los Amigos, that year's champions of the Island Baseball League in Guam. Palau's team lost in the semi-finals, with Los Amigos winning the tournament.\nThe Airai Aces won every championship between 1982 and 1989 save for 1986. Peleliu opted to forfeit the third game of the 1982 championship after dropping the first two games, and lost to Airai in the 1982 championship as well. Ngerbeches overcame Airai in the 1986 PML championship series, winning the set 3–2. As of 1989, there were five teams in the PML in one division.\n1990–1999: Aces continue to dominate.\nThe Airai Aces' success continued into the 1990s, with the team taking the PML Championship outright in 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995, and 1996, and splitting the championship with Ngerbeched in 1991. Ngerbeched won the PML Finals in 1993 and 1997. A joint Ngerbeched-Ngerbeches team was the 1998 PML champion.\nPalau's national team took the gold medal for baseball in the 1990 Micronesian Games in Saipan, beating Guam 8–0 in the final, and in the 1998 Games held in Palau. Palau took the bronze in baseball in the 1994 Micronesian Games. The 1999 PML season was cut short to allow Palau's athletes to train for the South Pacific Games, in which Palau finished 5th in baseball.\n2000–present: Koror wins first title.\nThe PML had seven teams in one division for the 2000 season. Ngerbeched was the 2000 PML champion, the team's third title in a row (not including the shortened 1999 season for which no champion was announced). Ngerbeched repeated in 2001, narrowly defeating Aimeliik in the finals. Airai returned to form to take the 2002, 2003 and 2004 titles,\nKoror defeated Ngerbeched to win the first PML title in the team's 60-year history in 2005. The team repeated in 2006, defeating Airai in the finals. Airai took the 2007 PML championship by defeating PCC four games to two in a seven-game championship series. Ngerbeched won the 2008 PML season.\nA team of Palauan youths aged 16 to 18 years took second placed in baseball in the inaugural 2004 Oceania AAA baseball tournament, held in Palau. Palau's national team took the gold in baseball in the 2007 Pacific Games in Samoa, finishing the tournament unbeaten with an 8–0 record, though the championship game was canceled due to rain.\nThe national baseball team took the bronze in baseball in the 2002 and 2006 Micronesian Games. However, Palau rebounded to take the gold medal in the 2010 Micronesian Games in Palau, defeating a team from the Northern Mariana Islands 7 to 3 in the final.\nIn November 2022, a Taiwanese NGO donated equipment to the Palau Major League in a ceremony attended by Palaun President Surangel Whipps Jr. and Taiwanese Vice President Lai Ching-te."

A New South Wales Country representative centre who later moved to the forwards, he played his club football in the NSWRL Premiership for the Parramatta Eels during their golden period of the 1980s. He also played in England for Leeds and Salford.\nBackground.\nLaurie was the fifth of six brothers and the younger brother of Robert Laurie.\nPlaying career.\nBorn in Wauchope, as teenager Laurie was earmarked for greatness representing North Coast in 1980 and 1981 whilst plying his trade for his local team the Wauchope Blues Rugby League Club. This caught the attention of Sydney clubs and in 1982 he would sign with the Parramatta Eels making his debut off the bench in round 2 that year in a 12–5 win over Balmain at Leichhardt Oval in front of 10,000 fans.\nIn his debut season Laurie would make 14 appearances for the Eels which included a Minor Premiership and a Grand Final victory over the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 21–8 in front of 50,000 fans at the Sydney Cricket Ground.\n1983 again saw Laurie play the majority of the season from the bench in a star studded team looking to achieve the first three-peat since the 1960s St George Dragons. Laurie would again come off the bench for the Eels as they became the 4th club in Australian Rugby League history to win three consecutive Grand Finals defeating Manly Warringah Sea Eagles 18–6.\nFollowing this great achievement, Laurie established himself as a regular starter filling in at Lock, second row, centre and five/eighth over the next few seasons.\n1986 saw Laurie and the Eels return to their winning ways, Parramatta secured another Minor Premiership which catapulted them to another Grand Final. This Grand Final would be Laurie's first starting role, playing in the second row in the 4–2 victory over arch rivals Canterbury Bankstown Bulldogs in Ray Price's final game.\nFollowing the retirement of Price, Laurie would transition into the lock role whilst filling in at centre and five eighth when required until retirement at the end of the 1992 season amassing 205 games in 11 seasons for the Parramatta Eels.\nSporadically throughout his career, Laurie would venture to the English competition utilising his skillset for Leeds and Salford. His first stint for Leeds, 1983–1984, saw Laurie's worth truly recognised reaching his 3rd Grand Final in 2 years. Laurie's experience in the League Cup Grand Final would prove instrumental as he was declared man of the match in the victory over Widnes 18–10.\nLaurie returned to Leeds in 89-90 where he improved their squad immensely, finishing 2 wins behind Minor Premiers Wigan. \nThe 1992-1993 English Championship season would be the final season Laurie would play professional rugby league, helping Salford avoid relegation."

It was said that due to the contortion he made when he served he looked like a \"monkey mounting a pole\". He had broken his leg soon after arriving at Magdalen College, Oxford, from Harrow School. Prior to Harrow, he was educated at Sandroyd School. While at Harrow he had appeared in every Eton v Harrow cricket match from 1919 to 1922. He played cricket for the university as a batsman and in 1925 appeared in a first-class match against Middlesex. Two years later he represented Scotland in a first-class match against Ireland.\nIn 1927 he made his Wimbledon debut, the first of 12 Wimbledon Championships that he entered. He missed the Championship in 1933 after injuring himself riding, but appeared in the event every other time until 1939.\nHis Davis Cup partnership with Colin Gregory proved successful as they were undefeated in their six matches together, in 1929 and 1930. They also combined in major tournaments and made the finals of both the Australian Championship and Wimbledon in 1929. Collins and Gregory lost to Jack Crawford and Harry Hopman in the Australian final in five sets, but beat them in the 1930 Davis Cup. They narrowly lost the Wimbledon final in another five setter, to Wilmer Allison and John Van Ryn. Collins was also a mixed doubles finalist in the 1929 Wimbledon Championship and again in 1931.\nAs a singles player, Collins had his best showing in 1930 when he reached the fourth round, before being eliminated by Bunny Austin. The following year he had the best win of his career when he defeated number one seed Henri Cochet in the second round of the 1931 Wimbledon Championship in four sets.\nHe won the Scottish Championships three consecutive times between 1926 and 1928, he was a finalist on six occasions between 1926 and 1936."

Member of Serbian national team, Marko Avramović decided to request the termination of the contract with the club so far. The reason was as he said, unprofessional and improper relationship between him and Partizan leaders. The problems started in a period when he missed the last three games in Euroleague against Budva, Jug and Jadran. Speaking for Sports Journal, Avramović said: \"At a press conference before the away match with Budva was stated I will not play in that match because of my poor form, which was not true. The reason is, that I refused to revise my current contract, I did not want my wages to be reduced.\"\nCrvena Zvezda.\nOn 17 February Avramović scored his first goal of the Serbian National Championship, in the third round of the \"A League\", in a 7–4 win over VK Beograd.\nHonours.\nClub.\nVK Partizan\nVK Crvena Zvezda\nFerencvárosi TC"

        "text": "The ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour (currently sponsored as the Uniqlo Wheelchair Tennis Tour and abbreviated to the Uniqlo Tour) is a tennis tour for disabled men and women. There are three divisions: Men, Women, and Quad. The Quad division is a mixed-gender division, for players which have impairments in at least three limbs, and the competitors are allowed to use motorized wheelchairs. The tour was formed in 1992, comprising just 11 events. The tour now has over 150 events.\nOverview.\nThe ITF Wheelchair Tennis Tour is the world tour for wheelchair tennis. It is also the branch of the International Tennis Federation that is designed to protect the interests of the wheelchair tennis game. As of 2011, 173 tournaments are covered by the tour over many different categories.\nThe tour's main goals are:\nHistory.\nWheelchair tennis started in the 1970s through Jeff Minnenbraker and Brad Parks. First tournament took place in Los Angeles in 1977, which was won by Parks. In 1980 the National Foundation of Wheelchair Tennis (NFWT) was formed. A circuit of 10 tournaments within the USA was also established including the first US Open Wheelchair Tennis Championships. In 1981 The Wheelchair Tennis Players Association (WTPA) was formed.\nThe WTPA was formed to: \na) Foster competitive wheelchair tennis for the physically disabled throughout the world;\nb) Establish and enforce rules which create fair and equitable play for all participants; \nc) Organise a competitive network of tournaments sanctioned by the association; and\nd) Formulate a uniform system throughout the world.\nAlso the WTPA with the NFWT formed the Grand Prix Circuit, linking four tournaments in major cities finishing with the US Open. The first tournaments outside of the USA began in France in 1982 as four tournaments were held. The first team competition the World Team Cup was established in 1985.

        "text": "The 2010–11 Harvard Crimson men's basketball team represented Harvard University in the Ivy League athletic conference during the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The team played its home games in Boston, Massachusetts at the Lavietes Pavilion, which has a capacity of 2,195. The team was led by fourth-year head coach Tommy Amaker. By earning a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season title, the team became the first men's basketball Ivy League champion in school history. This was the 100th season for Harvard basketball.\nAfter the annual 14-game double round robin schedule, Harvard and Princeton tied as co-champion, resulting in a one-game playoff to determine the league's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. After losing, the team earned an at-large bid to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, where they lost in the first round. It was the school's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament.\nThe seniorless team was captained by Keith Wright and Oliver McNally. Wright, a junior, was a unanimous All-Ivy first team selection and named Ivy League Men's Basketball Player of the Year. Sophomores Kyle Casey and Brandyn Curry were named All-Ivy second team and sophomore Christian Webster was an honorable mention. The team established a new school record for single-season wins, a record for conference game wins and by going undefeated at home set a record for home wins.\nPreseason.\nThe team was coming off a 2009–10 season during which it set a school record for wins (21), non-conference wins (11), home wins (11), and road/neutral wins (10). However, the team lost its star Jeremy Lin to the National Basketball Association. The team entered the season not having participated in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament since the 1946 Tournament. It also entered the season as the only member school not to have won at least one Ivy League men's basketball championship since the league was formed during the 1956–57 season. Of the 34 men's and women's sports in which Harvard competes, this was the only sport that they had never won a championship. They had only finished in second three times in the past and only one of those was outright.\nMost preseason publications predicted Princeton would finish in first place and Harvard would finish in second place, although the \"Sporting News\" projected that would finish in first followed by Princeton and Harvard. Breaking a three-year streak by Cornell, the Ivy League media poll selected Princeton as the top team with twelve first place votes, Harvard second with four first place votes and Cornell third with one first place vote. It was the first Princeton team to be the preseason selection since the .\nSeason.\nDuring the season, the team lost to its only ranked opponent, #4 Connecticut (December 22), but defeated power conference opponents Boston College (January 5) of the Atlantic Coast Conference and Colorado (November 28) of the Big 12 Conference. The Colorado victory was the team's first ever against a Big 12 opponent. In addition to defeating Boston College, the team defeated other cross-town rivals (December 11) and (December 31). The team also lost to Amaker's former team (as a coach), Michigan (December 4). The Harvard gameplan involved fast breaks initiated by its defensive and an inside-outside game. Although Harvard never appeared in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, for a few weeks (January 24, January 31 and February 21 and March 7) during the season they received a vote in the AP Poll.\nAs the season wound down, there was much ado in the press about a possible Harvard Ivy League championship. The most recent Harvard team to be in contention for a championship entering the final weekend was the 1984 team. On March 5, Harvard clinched a share of the league championship for the first time since the Ivy League was formed. By defeating Princeton at home on March 5 and earning a split of the season series, they clinched at least a share of the 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season Championship with a 12–2 conference record. Princeton fell to 11–2 with one conference game remaining to force a one-game playoff for the conferences automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Harvard finished the season a perfect 14–0 at home, which surpassed the prior season's record of eleven home wins. Harvard will enter the 2011–12 NCAA Division I men's basketball season with a 17-game home streak (10th longest in the country). Harvard's 12 conference game wins was also a school record. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. It was the first time in program history that they received votes in the Coaches' Poll.\nPostseason.\nOn March 8, Princeton defeated Penn to force a one-game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. Princeton won the playoff by a 63–62 margin. However, many thought Harvard had a chance to make the tournament in spite of the loss as an at-large team. Four of Harvard's regular season losses were to postseason contenders, and Cornell represented the conference well the year before. Entering selection Sunday (March 13), Harvard ranked 35th in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI). However, Harvard was not selected. Unfortunately, neither of Harvard's quality wins (against Colorado and Boston College) helped them because both teams were left out of the NCAA tournament and relegated to number one seed status in the NIT tournament. It was the Ivy League's first NIT invitation since the 2003 when Brown participated. As a regular season champion not invited to the NCAA tournament, they were an at-large selection for the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, where they were seeded #6. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. The final record of 23–7 established a school record for number of wins, surpassing the prior season's total of 21. Harvard finished the season ranked 40th nationally by the \"Collegiate Basketball News\" RPI, CollegeRPI.com RPI and NCAA RPI. The team finished second in the nation in free throw percentage (80.8%), led by Oliver McNally who was 2nd as an individual with a 92.6% and Christian Webster who was 12th with an 89.4%. Harvard had no seniors on the team and was expected to be a contender again the following season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9 style=| Regular season\n \n!colspan=9 style=| Ivy League Playoff\n!colspan=9 style=| NIT\nHonors.\nIn season.\nEach week the Ivy League selects a player of the week and a rookie of the week.\nPostseason honors.\nKeith Wright was an Associated Press honorable mention All-American, a CollegeInsider.com Lou Henson All-American and a National Association of Basketball Coaches First Team All-District selection.

        "text": "Palos Verdes Golf Club is a private golf and social club on the West coast of the United States, located in Palos Verdes Estates, California, a suburb southwest of Los Angeles.\nHistory.\nThe golf course design began in 1923, and the course was opened in 1924. The club, an amenity for area residents in the newly developed Palos Verdes Project, was designed by Olmsted Brothers together with the architects George C. Thomas and William P. Bell. Many varieties of trees were planted during original construction, which are now very mature and line and narrow the fairways. The land on which the course is situated is owned by the City of Palos Verdes Estates, and the club is operated under a concession agreement with the city.\nThe clubhouse underwent a major remodel from 2005 to 2007 and is a popular venue for weddings, with expansive views of the Pacific Ocean and variable capacity.\nGeneral information.\nThe greens at Palos Verdes are a mixture of \"Poa annua\" and bent grass, and the fairways are kikuyu grass. The course has much change in elevation, and can be difficult for some players to walk. Guests may play the course with a member, or may pay a public rate of $275 with highly restricted non-member tee times available. For the dress code, denim is not allowed; a tucked-in collared shirt, belt, and slacks or Bermuda shorts are required, as are soft spikes. The course sits on , within an parkland preserve, encompassing several connecting canyons and unmanicured forestland.\nMembership is generally restricted to residential property owners in the city of Palos Verdes Estates, and is open to residents of neighboring cities only by sponsorship from an existing member, and when no residents are on the waiting list. Nonresidents of Palos Verdes Estates additionally pay a higher entrance fee. Over the last few years, the waiting list for membership has shortened, allowing residents to join quickly and nonresidents to join within one year.\nThe club is the site of the annual Northrop Grumman Regional Challenge - an invitational tournament for the top NCAA women's golf teams in the country. In 2022, it hosted the inaugural edition of the LPGA Tour's Palos Verdes Championship.\nThe course.\nThe course is par 71 and from the black tees, from the blue tees, from the white tees, and from the red tees. The men's slope ratings are 72.3/133, 71.2/130 and 68.9/124 for the black, blue, and white tees, respectively.\nWhile not considered lengthy at just under 6,500 yards, the architects' use of the natural terrain, barrancas, creeks, and hills, combined with small greens, extensive bunkering, narrow fairways with strategically designed landing areas, and prevailing westerly ocean breezes, the course presents a challenge for players of all levels. Members have taken great care in preserving the original design and routing of this masterpiece. As of July 2013, the course underwent a fresh $1.5M renovation, restoring some of the lost hole design features and removing hundreds of trees to open up ocean views, and adding modern chipping areas around most greens.\nA number of the holes (1, 2, 3, 6, 12, 13, 14) play long, as they are into the prevailing west wind from the Pacific Ocean, less than a mile from the course. Fourteen of the course's eighteen holes feature panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean (a Thomas trademark).\nThe front nine is a \"perfect nine\" - where no two holes in a row are of the same par.\nThe course record post-renovation (black tees) is 61; the long-standing record from the blue tees pre-2013 is 59."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Ivy League men's basketball season marks the continuation of the annual tradition of competitive basketball among Ivy League members that began when the league was formed during the 1956–57 season, continuing from the predecessor Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball League, which was formed in 1902. Following the annual 14-game round robin home &amp; home schedule, Harvard and Princeton tied as co-champion. Princeton earned the conference's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament in a one-game playoff. Harvard was invited to the 2011 National Invitation Tournament. Both teams lost their first tournament games.\nPreseason.\nEntering the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, four of the eight teams had coaches entering their first full season as head coach: Columbia's Kyle Smith, Cornell's Bill Courtney, Dartmouth's Paul Cormier and Penn's Jerome Allen (previously interim). Most preseason publications predicted Princeton would finish in first place and Harvard would finish in second place, although the \"Sporting News\" projected that would finish in first followed by Princeton and Harvard. Breaking a three-year streak by Cornell, the Ivy League media poll selected Princeton as the top team with twelve first place votes, Harvard second with four first place votes and Cornell third with one first place vote. It was the first Princeton team to be the preseason selection since the .\nSeason.\nNon-conference play began on November 12, 2010. The first conference game took place on January 8, 2011. Although no Ivy League teams appeared in the 2010–11 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings, for a few weeks during the season Harvard received a vote in the AP Poll. When Harvard earned its 20th win on February 19, against Columbia, it marked the eighth time that two Ivy League teams totalled 20 wins. On March 7, Harvard received a vote in both the AP Poll and the Coaches' Poll. Then, in the final regular season poll on March 13, Princeton received 3 points in the Coaches' Poll.\nThe conference had two players recognized as Academic All-Americans: senior guard Garrett Leffelman and junior guard Chris Wroblewski.\nHarvard's Oliver McNally concluded his season with a 100 for 108 (92.6%) Free throw percentage mark second to Chris Warren of the Ole Miss Rebels who led with a 168 for 181 (92.8%) mark.\nOn March 5, Harvard clinched a share of the league championship for the first time since the Ivy League was formed. On March 8, Princeton defeated Penn to force a one-game playoff at the Payne Whitney Gymnasium at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. The matchup was widely anticipated in the press.\nPostseason.\nPrior to the game both teams received championship trophies. Princeton prevailed in the playoff with a final score of 63–62, on a last-second jump shot from Douglas Davis. This earned them the conference's automatic bid to the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament for being the regular season champion. The 2011 one-game playoff was the eighth in Ivy League history. Princeton appeared for the eighth time, and have won at least a share of twenty-six league titles.\nEntering selection Sunday (March 13), Harvard ranked 35th in the Ratings Percentage Index (RPI) and Princeton ranked 40th. Princeton was a #13 Seed in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, while Harvard was not selected, denying the Crimson its first tournament appearance since 1946. Harvard's wins against major-conference opponents Colorado and Boston College were not enough to secure it an at-large bid (both Colorado and Boston College were left out of the NCAA tournament and received one-seeds in the NIT tournament.) As a regular season champion not invited to the NCAA tournament, Harvard earned an at-large selection for the 2011 National Invitation Tournament, where it was seeded #6. On March 15, Harvard was defeated by by a 71–54 margin in the first round. It was the school's first appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. Princeton lost its opening game against the fourth-seeded and eventual national semifinalist Kentucky Wildcats by a 59–57 margin on a last second layup.\nHonors.\nIn season.\nEach week the Ivy League selects a player of the week and a rookie of the week.\nPostseason honors.\nThe league selected its postseason awards on March 9.&lt;br&gt;\nPlayer of the Year: Keith Wright, Harvard (Jr., F, Suffolk, VA)&lt;br&gt;\nDefensive Player of the Year: Kareem Maddox, Princeton (Sr., F, Oak Park, CA)&lt;br&gt;\nRookie of the Year: Sean McGonagill, Brown (Fr., G, Brookfield, IL)&lt;br&gt;\nAll-Ivy League (ALL CAPS: Unanimous)&lt;br&gt;"

He made his test debut at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 12 June 1954 against Great Britain in the first test of that year's Ashes series. Australia won this test 37–12.\nIn 1953 Watson toured New Zealand with the Australian team.\nIn the 1954 Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final Watson scored two tries and kicked four goals before fracturing his left collarbone about ten minutes after the start of the second half and leaving the field. His team, Western Suburbs, went on to win the game. He then travelled to France to play in the inaugural World Cup.\nIn 1956 New Zealand toured Australia and in the last test match played at the Gabba, Watson scored the decisive try, a forty-metre effort that gave Australia their first series victory at home against the Kiwis since 1909. In that year's premiership semi-final Watson was suspended for two weeks for using abusive language and refusing to leave the field when ordered to by the referee.\nWatson played his last match for Australia during the 1957 World Cup. That year he also played his last game for the Maroons. Watson then moved north to play for Sarina in 1958."

        "title": "Joseph Barss (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Joseph Ernest Barss (February 27, 1892 – January 26, 1971) was an ice hockey player and coach. He was the first head coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team, holding the position from 1922 to 1927. He was later employed as a medical doctor and surgeon in the Chicago area.\nEarly years.\nBarss was born in Madras, India (now known as Chennai) in February 1892. His father, John Howard Barss (born Wolfville, Nova Scotia) was ordained in July 1891 and traveled to India as a Baptist missionary. In 1893, while still an infant, Barss returned to Canada with his parents. He traveled with his parents from Liverpool, England, arriving in New York on October 30, 1893. They returned to their home in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, where Barss' father operated a grocery store and served as a Baptist minister. Barss was enrolled at Acadia University in Wolfville, receiving his degree in 1912. After graduating from Acadia, Barss played professional hockey for the Montreal Wanderers of the National Hockey Association.\nWorld War I.\nIn April 1915, Barss entered the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of World War I. At that time, he listed his occupation as clerk and indicated that he had three years of prior military service. In his history of the University of Michigan's hockey program, author John U. Bacon provides a lengthy account of Barss' war-time service and its impact on his decision to become a medical doctor. According to Bacon, Barss was wounded by shrapnel and gassed at the Second Battle of Ypres in April and May 1915. However, Barss' military records indicate that Barss' Attestation Paper for the Canadian Over-Seas Expeditionary Force was completed on April 30, 1915 in Montreal. Accordingly, it appears that Barss likely did not see combat action at the Second Battle of Ypres. Barss' Service Record states that he was wounded on June 2, 1916. He was a machine gunner sergeant with the P.P.C.L.I and badly wounded in Sanctuary Wood during the first day of the Battle of Mt. Sorrel on the eastern border of Ypres, Belgium. According to Bacon, Barss suffered permanent lung damage and a severe abdominal injury from shrapnel while serving in Belgium. After a lengthy hospitalization in France, Barss was sent to Camp Hill Hospital in Halifax, Nova Scotia in November 1917. Barss arrived in Halifax weeks before the Halifax Explosion, an explosion of a ship in Halifax harbor loaded with 10 tons of gunpowder, 35 tons of airplane fuel and 200 tons of TNT. More than 1,700 people were killed in the explosion. Barss was not injured and helped tend to the injured in the aftermath of the disaster.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nIn 1919, Barss enrolled at the University of Michigan as a graduate student in bacteriology. In 1920, he enrolled at the Medical School, receiving a medical degree from the university in 1924.\nWhile attending medical school at Michigan, Barss also served as the first coach of the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team. According to Wilfred Byron Shaw's four-volume history of the University of Michigan, hockey had its beginning at Michigan in 1921 with Barss as the coach. Other sources indicate that Barss became the coach of the Michigan hockey team in 1922. According to Bacon, Barss officiated many of the games for the 1922 team and then asked athletic director Fielding H. Yost if he could start a varsity hockey team. Bacon wrote that Yost \"might not have known much about hockey, but he knew a natural coach when he met one\" and accepted Barss' offer.\nIt was not until 1923 that the Michigan hockey team received formal recognition as a varsity sport. The first \"official\" college hockey game played west of the Alleghenies was a game between Michigan and Wisconsin, played on January 12, 1923, in Ann Arbor, Michigan. The game went into overtime with Michigan prevailing by a score of 2-1.\nBarss coached the Michigan Wolverines men's ice hockey team during its first five years as a formal varsity sport. During those five years (1923 to 1927), the Michigan hockey team compiled a record of 26-21-4.\nAs the popularity of college hockey grew in the early 1920s, other colleges looked to Barss' pupils for coaching candidates. In January 1923, former Michigan hockey star Russell Barkell was hired as the coach of the hockey team at Williams College.\nIn February 1924, after a 3-0 victory by Michigan over Wisconsin, a Madison newspaper praised the defensive play of the Barss-coached Wolverines: \"With an almost air-tight defense and a definite scoring attack the Michigan hockey team defeated the Badger six by a score of 3 to 0 yesterday afternoon. Wisconsin could not stop Michigan's fast team work and was unable to penetrate their defense to take any close shots at the goal.\"\nBy January 1925, the Michigan ice hockey team had four returning letter men from the prior year's team, and a call for candidates by Coach Barss \"brought out 20 aspirants.\"\nMedical career.\nAfter retiring as Michigan's hockey coach in 1927, Barss moved to Riverside, Illinois. He worked at the Hines Veteran Hospital in Maywood, Illinois, eventually becoming the chief of surgery there. In June 1930, Barss became a naturalized United States citizen. That same year, U.S. Census records show that Barss was living in Riverside, Illinois with his wife, Helen Kolb Barss, and two children, Joseph (age 6) and Elizabeth (age 2). In his registration card for the draft at the time of World War II, Barss indicated that he was a physician and surgeon residing in Riverside and having his place of business at 1011 Lake Street in Oak Park, Illinois.\nLater years and death.\nBarss retired from his medical practice in 1962 and moved to Florida. In 1971, Barss died of Alzheimer's disease in Fort Lauderdale, Florida at age 79."

        "text": "Arthur James Marshall Jr. (born April 29, 1969) is a former American football wide receiver in the National Football League. He was signed by the Denver Broncos as an undrafted free agent in 1992. He played college football at Georgia.\nMarshall also played for the New York Giants.\nEarly life.\nMarshall, born in Fort Gordon, Georgia, was one of eight siblings, which included three brothers and four sisters. He played high school football for Hephzibah High which is located in Hephzibah, Georgia. Marshall graduated from high school with a 92.167 average. He scored a 1,020 on his SAT which earned him the Scholar Athlete of the Year Award for the state.\nCollegiate career.\nMarshall was a stretch-the-field type of wide receiver for head coach Ray Goff and the University of Georgia from 1988 to 1991. The 5-11, 175-pound speedster hauled in 39 receptions for 524 yards during his senior season in 1991 as the Bulldogs completed a 9-3 season ranked No. 19 by the AP College Football Poll.\nAdditionally, Marshall returned kickoffs for Georgia as he had totalled 15 such returns for 347 yards averaging 23.1 per return during 1991.\nDuring his junior year at Georgia Marshall broke his leg and had a rod inserted. It didn't impact him playing on the field but impacted his chances in the NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nMarshall was picked up by the Denver Broncos after going undrafted in the 1992 NFL Draft. As a rookie, Marshall had solid numbers for a No. 2 wide receiver with 26 catches for 493 yards and a touchdown. Denver finished the 1992 season at 8–8 while Marshall also handled the return duties for the Broncos. He totalled 33 punt returns for 349 yards while averaging 10.6 yards per return. Marshall's longest punt return was 47 yards that year while he also covered some kickoff returns—eight for 132 yards and a 16.5 yard average.\nIn a game against the Dallas Cowboys, Marshall completed an 81-yard touchdown pass to Broncos' teammate Cedric Tillman. This tied a record held by Gary Hammond for the longest pass completion by a non-quarterback in NFL history. The record has since been equaled by Pittsburgh Steelers punter Josh Miller in 2003.\nIn 1993, Marshall's Denver Broncos finished third in the AFC West Division at 9–7. He remained as one of quarterback John Elway's top receivers by hauling in 28 receptions for 360 yards and two scores. Their season came to an end following an AFC Wild Card matchup that pitted them against the Los Angeles Raiders on January 9, 1994. The Raiders won the contest, 42–24.\nSoon, Marshall joined his former Georgia Bulldogs teammate Rodney Hampton as he was picked up by Hampton's New York Giants in a trade made by Denver on April 26, 1994, for a seventh-round draft choice in return. Marshall's new team finished at 9-7 in '94 as he had 16 catches for 219 yards while playing in all 16 games. Also, Marshall resumed his kick return duties as he had 15 kickoff returns for 249 yards (16.6 average) that included a longest return of 30 yards.\nHis last two seasons in the NFL were spent with the same franchise as the New York Giants struggled going 5-11 and 6-10 in 1995 and 1996 respectively. Marshall totalled 17 catches for 195 yards and a touchdown in 1995. In 1996, Marshall was used as the team's punt returner as he recorded 13 returns for 144 yards (11.1 average) and a longest return of 36 yards.\nPersonal.\nIn June 2010, Marshall was sentenced to 69 months in prison for bank fraud."

The man to take greatest advantage was Rory McIlroy, maintaining his good play in recent majors: he led after the first round of the 2010 Open Championship and after all of the first three rounds of the 2011 Masters Tournament, as well as finishing T-3rd in the 2010 PGA Championship. He carded a bogey-free 65 to sit at six-under-par, three ahead of two major winners: Y. E. Yang, the 2009 PGA champion, and Charl Schwartzel, who had beat McIlroy at the 2011 Masters and so was looking for his second straight major. The large group on two-under-par included a resurgent Sergio García, reigning Open champion Louis Oosthuizen, and several unexpected names, including journeymen Scott Hend and Alexandre Rocha. 22-year-old New Yorker Chris DeForest, playing in his first professional tournament, looked set to join them until double-bogeying his final hole for a 71. Defending champion Graeme McDowell was well-placed after an opening 70; he was alongside Robert Rock, who had only arrived on-site at 3am that morning after visa problems. However, the marquee group of Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer, numbers one, two and three in the world, all struggled, carding 74, 75 and 74 respectively. The leading amateurs were Peter Uihlein and Brad Benjamin, who were both at one-over-par.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 17, 2011\" &lt;br&gt;\n\"Saturday, June 18, 2011\"\nRory McIlroy was the headline story once again on Friday, as he continued his good form, breaking several U.S. Open scoring records in the process. Out early in the morning session, he added an eagle two on the 8th hole to a succession of pars and birdies, and a two-putt birdie at the 16th took him to 12-under-par. This tied the record score under par for any player, at any point of the tournament in the history of the U.S. Open; Gil Morgan and Tiger Woods had previously achieved the feat, but having played only 34 holes at the time, McIlroy was the quickest to reach it. One hole later, another birdie made the Northern Irishman the first player in U.S. Open history to reach 13-under-par. An immediate double-bogey at the 18th – McIlroy's first dropped shots of the tournament – took him back to 11-under, and a second round of 66, but the record-breaking continued: his eventual six-shot lead was the joint largest after 36 holes in major championship history. McIlroy also set the record for fewest holes to reach 10-under-par, 26 holes, (13 fewer than the prior record) and lowest 36-hole total in U.S. Open history.\nThe man McIlroy led was South Korea's Y. E. Yang, who added a 69 to his opening 68 to sit on his own at five-under-par; he himself was three clear of the chasing pack. Sergio García's solid form continued, and he was in the group at two-under-par, as was the consistent Matt Kuchar after a 68. Further down the field, Germany's Marcel Siem tied for the low round of the day, matching McIlroy's 66 to surge up the field after a disappointing opening 79. Amateur Patrick Cantlay also hit a hot streak, shooting a back nine of 30 to complete a round of 67 and move to even par, tying for low amateur with Russell Henley. The premier group of Luke Donald, Lee Westwood and Martin Kaymer enjoyed a slightly better day, as all three battled hard to stay inside the cutline, with Westwood leading the three at one-over-par. Like all the afternoon starters, they were disrupted by a 42-minute delay in play as a thunderstorm passed over Congressional Country Club; this meant seven groups would need to return on Saturday morning to complete their rounds. After completion of the second round on Saturday morning, the cut fell at four-over-par, with 72 players getting through to the final two rounds.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 18, 2011\"\nConditions continued to allow good scoring on Saturday, with several players taking advantage. Rory McIlroy was in no mood to relinquish his lead, however. A steady front nine saw him make his way back to 13-under-par, after Friday's closing double-bogey, when he birdied the par-five 9th. Once again 13 proved to be McIlroy's unlucky number as he bogeyed the 10th hole, but he swiftly regained his composure to become the first man ever to reach 14-under-par at a U.S. Open, before parring his way home. Alongside him, former PGA champion Y. E. Yang scrambled well through a difficult front nine, and picked up two shots on his inward nine for a good 70, putting him in the final pairing once again on Sunday. Below him, Saturday began to live up to its \"moving day\" title. Jason Day, runner-up at the 2011 Masters Tournament, and world number two Lee Westwood surged through the field with best-of-the-day 65s to move into a tie for third and the penultimate pairing for Sunday; Westwood's third round playing partner Freddie Jacobson fared only one shot worse with a 66. This matched the low score amongst the early starters, made by major debutant Webb Simpson, whose 66 took him from the cutline to one-under-par, and the top 15.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 19, 2011\"\nRory McIlroy began the final day eight shots clear of Y. E. Yang. McIlroy birdied the first hole and also went on to birdie the fourth. He missed the water hazard by a foot on the sixth hole, but still managed to make a par. At this point, Yang was two-under-par for the day but not challenging McIlroy. At the par-3 10th, Yang played first and hit his tee shot to four feet; McIlroy followed with an approach which caught the top of the slope behind the flag, and trickled down past Yang's ball to finish just inches away from the cup. This birdie moved McIlroy to a record-breaking 17-under-par for the tournament. A bogey on the 12th knocked him down to 16-under. On the par-5 16th, he got to 17-under again with a birdie but lost a shot with a bogey on the 17th green, his only three-putt of the tournament, finishing on 16-under. Two bogeys on the back nine saw Yang fall back into a tie for third place, with young Australian Jason Day moving into second place on his own; it was his second consecutive runner-up finish in the majors, in only his fourth major start; but he was a distant eight strokes behind McIlroy.\nRory McIlroy and Robert Garrigus accomplished the rare feat of shooting all four rounds of golf under par in a U.S. Open. This had occurred only four times previously in the history of the event. Yang would have joined this group were it not for a bogey on the 72nd hole. McIlroy also had the additional distinction of setting the U.S. Open 72-hole low marks for total shots and shots under par, at 268 and −16, respectively. McIlroy also became only the third golfer ever to shoot all four rounds under 70 at a U.S. Open, after Lee Trevino in 1968 and Lee Janzen in 1993.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The 1914–15 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team represented the University of Illinois.\nRegular season.\nCoached by Ralph Jones, the 1914–15 Fighting Illini men's basketball team became the first undefeated Big Ten champion in the history of the school as well as the fourth Big Ten National Champion. That 1915\nseason was the third in the eight-year tenure of head coach Ralph Jones and it produced the only unbeaten season in Illini history and the first Big Ten title for the Illinois basketball program. The Illinois team was retroactively named national champions by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Jones’ 1915 team scored twice as many points as its opponents and won the conference title by three games over Chicago. The arrival of the Woods brothers in 1914 had a lot to do with the success of this era. Guard Ray Woods was named first-team All-America all three years he competed (1915–17), and twin brother Ralf, a forward, led the team in scoring in both 1916 and 1917. His consistency at the free throw line led to the establishment\nof the Ralf Woods Award, which is still given annually to the Fighting Illini player with the best free-throw percentage. The starting lineup included Frank Bane at center, Clyde Alwood and Edward Allan Williford at the forward positions, \"captain\" Sven Duner at guard and brothers Ralf Woods and Ray Woods. Ray Woods was named an All-American during this season.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:white;\"| Non-Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#DF4E38; color:#FFFFFF;\"|Big Ten regular season \nAwards and honors.\nRay Woods was elected to the \"Illini Men's Basketball All-Century Team\" in 2004.

        "title": "2012 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2012 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the 2012 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place at the Suzuka Circuit in Mie Prefecture, Japan on 7 October 2012 at 15:00 local time. The race was the fifteenth round of the 2012 season, and marked the 38th running of the Japanese Grand Prix.\nSebastian Vettel started the race from pole position for the fourth successive year at Suzuka, eventually leading the race from start to finish, winning by 20 seconds over Felipe Massa – who achieved his first podium since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix – in second place. Kamui Kobayashi achieved his first and only Formula One podium, the first for a Japanese driver since Takuma Sato in 2004, and the first for a Japanese driver at their home Grand Prix since Aguri Suzuki in 1990. As of 2022, this was the last podium for a Japanese driver. It was also the last podium for Sauber. The race was also Vettel's second career grand slam (leading every single lap from pole position and finishing with the fastest lap of the race). His first was the 2011 Indian Grand Prix.\nReport.\nBackground.\nMichael Schumacher received a ten-place grid penalty for causing an avoidable accident with Jean-Éric Vergne during the Singapore Grand Prix, while Jenson Button and Nico Hülkenberg were both demoted five places for making unscheduled gearbox changes.\nEntering the Grand Prix, Fernando Alonso of Ferrari led the Drivers' Championship on a total of 194 points, 29 points clear of the second-placed Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel. Lotus driver Kimi Räikkönen was third in the standings, and 16 points adrift of Vettel, despite not having won a race in 2012. McLaren driver Lewis Hamilton's championship hopes were becoming increasingly slim as he lay 50 points behind Alonso in fourth place, albeit 10 points ahead of the second Red Bull of Mark Webber and 23 ahead of his own teammate, Jenson Button. Red Bull led the Constructors' Championship on 297 points, 36 ahead of nearest challengers McLaren, 52 ahead of Ferrari and 66 ahead of Lotus with six rounds remaining. Mercedes had lost a large amount of ground as they had just 136 points.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its silver-banded hard compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre, as opposed to the previous year where the medium compound was used as the \"prime\" tyre.\nIn the week leading up to the race it was announced, amidst many rumours, that Lewis Hamilton would leave McLaren (who he had been contracted with since age 13) when his contract expired at the end of the season, and join Mercedes for the following three years. After his three podium finishes for the Sauber team, it was announced that Sergio Pérez would be Hamilton's replacement, and accompany Button, at McLaren. After losing his seat at Mercedes, Michael Schumacher announced his second retirement from Formula One on the Thursday before the race.\nPractice.\nJenson Button and Lewis Hamilton set the first and second fastest times respectively during the first session for McLaren. The Red Bull of Mark Webber finished the session with the third fastest time, three tenths slower than Button's quickest time. His teammate, Sebastian Vettel, finished the session down in seventeenth place. The Mercedes of Nico Rosberg set the fourth fastest time of the session, despite having to abandon his car out on track at the Esses with one minute remaining. Championship leader, Fernando Alonso, was eleventh, ahead of Sergio Pérez and both Lotus cars, who had just introduced their new Double DRS to their car. Williams' reserve driver Valtteri Bottas filled in for Bruno Senna and finished the session eighteenth; Giedo van der Garde did the same for Heikki Kovalainen at Caterham and set the twenty-third fastest time. There were no incidents damaging any of the cars during the session; the most notable things to happen were Michael Schumacher and Timo Glock running across the gravel at Degner, and Romain Grosjean running wide at Spoon.\nQualifying.\nThe Force India of Paul di Resta was the first car out on track for the first part of the qualifying session, initially using the harder compound prime tyres. The Sauber team also adopted that tactic, and their driver, Sergio Pérez, ran wide at the end of the Esses and bounded across the gravel before wrestling the car back to track. Later in the session, after Sebastian Vettel provisionally set the fastest time on prime tyres as well, Bruno Senna, in his Williams, was impeded by the Toro Rosso of Jean-Éric Vergne. On the approach to the final chicane Senna, on a flying lap, was held up by the slow-moving Vergne and gesticulated wildly out of his cockpit, forsaking his next flying lap in frustration. Vergne was issued with a three-place grid penalty for the race after he made the cut for the second part in qualifying in seventeenth. Vergne said that he had to slow down because he was catching Timo Glock before his flying lap. Michael Schumacher left his flying laps until the dying moments of the session, and after making a mistake at the second Degner curve, he found himself in last place with one last lap to make it into Q2; he was slower than Senna in the first two sectors of the circuit before crossing the line with the sixteenth fastest time, pushing Senna out. The Lotus of Romain Grosjean set the session's fastest time on the softer compound tyres, followed by the two Saubers and his teammate Kimi Räikkönen, who also needed to use those tyres.\nBehind Senna was the Caterham of Heikki Kovalainen in nineteenth, albeit with a time more than a second slower than Senna. His teammate, Vitaly Petrov, had a disappointing session qualifying in twenty-third place, as the two Marussia cars sandwiched an impressive HRT of Pedro de la Rosa, with Timo Glock taking twentieth and Charles Pic taking twenty-second. Petrov was, however, only two tenths slower than Glock, but three tenths faster than Narain Karthikeyan who took last place on the grid. As Vergne qualified in seventeenth place in Q2, and Michael Schumacher came to the race with a ten-place grid drop penalty for causing an avoidable incident in Singapore after eventually qualifying 13th – Senna, Kovalainen and Glock started two places further up on the grid in 16th, 17th and 18th respectively, and behind Vergne, de la Rosa, Pic and Petrov moved up one place on the grid to start from 20th, 21st and 22nd respectively in front of Schumacher and Karthikeyan.\nEvery car used the option tyres during the second part of qualifying. Di Resta complained over his pit-to-car radio after he had to weave in and out of Webber and Grosjean on a flying lap approaching the final chicane. This was not his fastest time, however, as he missed out on reaching the final part of qualifying by just half a tenth of a second, in twelfth place. The Toro Rossos failed to progress in the session in sixteenth and seventeenth, with Daniel Ricciardo out-qualifying Vergne for the eleventh time in 2012, and the Mercedes duo of Schumacher – attempting to save tyres again with a last minute effort – and Nico Rosberg in thirteenth and fifteenth respectively, with the Williams of Pastor Maldonado splitting them. Felipe Massa was the last man out on track at the end of the session, and looked likely to beat Nico Hülkenberg's tenth place time but abandoned his lap and was eleventh. After Hülkenberg elected not to set a time in Q3, his five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change came into effect, dropping him to fifteenth on the grid.\nThe third and final session of qualifying began with a lack of action on track. However, the McLarens, Red Bulls and Lotuses all chose to do two separate flying lap efforts. After the first of these were complete, Vettel and Webber had set the first and second fastest times respectively. Webber was two tenths behind, hampered by an error at the hairpin; Button was third, followed by the Lotus cars of Grosjean and Räikkönen and Hamilton's McLaren, who despite being on a scrubbed set of tyres, was still one and a half seconds slower than Vettel. During the second phase and with time running out in the session, Räikkönen ran wide at Spoon curve, and whilst returning onto the track, spun again and stopped at the edge of the track. Yellow flags were brought out, and Pérez was the only driver in front of Räikkönen who did not have to slow down.\nVettel and Webber were both on faster laps than their previous ones, but were unable improve their times because of the yellow flags. They maintained their grid slots, though, as the team took their first front row lock-out of the season. Vettel claimed his fourth successive pole at the Suzuka circuit, maintaining his 100% record there and, with the 34th pole position of his career, he moved into third in the all-time list for pole positions, behind Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna. It was decided by the stewards that Vettel had held Fernando Alonso up during his flying lap, but he was only given a reprimand. Button marginally improved his time, remaining in third place which would eventually become eighth on the grid due to a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change. Kamui Kobayashi took an impressive fourth place for Sauber, but immediately after he set the time it was suggested that he had not slowed down in the yellow flag area. He was allowed to keep the place on the grounds he had not used KERS or DRS as normal. After Button's gearbox penalty, this became third place, the best ever qualifying position from a Japanese driver at his home race. Grosjean's time was next fastest, in front of Pérez, Räikkönen and Alonso. Räikkönen was sixth, and Alonso said he could have easily been higher up the grid were it not for Räikkönen's spin. Hamilton, who qualified ninth, bemoaned a poorly handling car after a set-up change.\nRace.\nIt was a bright and sunny afternoon in Suzuka, for the race which started a 15:00 (local time). Every driver except Jean-Èric Vergne, Charles Pic and Michael Schumacher started the race on the softer compound 'option' tyres.\nThere was a chaotic start to the race as collisions at the first turn brought out the safety car on the opening lap. Vettel led away from pole and Kobayashi had a faster start than Webber, who slotted in behind him in third. Meanwhile, Alonso was hit from behind by Räikkönen, as the front wing of the Lotus clipped Alonso's rear wheel, puncturing the tyre, sending him into a spin across the gravel and back near the track at the first corner. Räikkönen's teammate, Romain Grosjean, was too busy attempting to stay in front of the fast-starting Sauber of Peréz on his outside at the first corner, so he ran into the back of third-placed Mark Webber, spinning him round at Turn 2, breaking his own wing in the process. This crash had consequences for other drivers as well, as Bruno Senna attempted to slide into a disappearing gap on Nico Rosberg's inside in order to avoid the crash. This broke Senna's wing and forced Rosberg to retire from the race. Alonso was the other retiree from the crash, seen walking away immediately, as Webber, Senna and Grosjean all had to pit for new front wings. Webber was worst affected as he had to recover from the grass. It wasn't all bad news for all the drivers, though, as Button had made up five places to move into third, and Massa had moved up six places to fourth after they used some opportunistic weaving.\nAt the end of the safety car period, and the beginning of lap 3, Vettel sprinted away from Kobayashi, quickly establishing a three-second lead and building on it. Sergio Pérez attempted to overtake Räikkönen for fifth place at Turn 1, but he was forced wide and slotted in behind sixth place Hamilton, and in front of Hülkenberg. He managed to overtake Hamilton at the hairpin on lap 6, locking his tyres and creeping around the apex. He then began to move back towards the fifth-placed Lotus of Räikkönen. The Caterham of Heikki Kovalainen was impressing at this point in the race by running in eleventh position. Next, Romain Grosjean was handed a ten-second stop-go penalty for the collision, he took it and returned to the track in last position. It was his seventh collision on the first lap of a race in 2012, and his eighth within the first two laps. By this point, Michael Schumacher had climbed his way from twenty-third to fourteenth, despite losing telemetry to his team.\nVettel and Massa were the drivers showing good pace when Button became the first driver to make a scheduled pit-stop in the race in lap 13. Räikkönen and Hülkenberg pitted the following lap from fifth and eighth positions respectively, having to make their way past Vergne and Kovalainen after their pit stops. Kobayashi pitted on lap 16 to promote Felipe Massa to second place, but kept Button behind him as both were temporarily held up by drivers yet to stop, before promptly overtaking them. Vettel and Massa pitted from first and second on lap 20 and maintained their positions, meaning Vettel had not relinquished his lead, and Massa had leap-frogged both Kobayashi and Button with a quick stop. Pérez attempted the same move he had overtaken Hamilton with the previous time at the hairpin on lap 19, but this time Hamilton moved to the inside line and Pérez carried too much speed into the corner, sliding round and getting stuck in the gravel trap. He was the third retirement of the race. On lap 22, Senna was given a drive through penalty for his contact with Rosberg at the start of the race. By this point, Mark Webber had worked his way back up to ninth place, but had to pit a few laps later.\nHamilton and Kobayashi pitted on lap 31, one lap after Räikkönen, who Hamilton was competing with now for fifth spot. He overtook him at Turn 1 on the following lap. On lap 34, Narain Karthikeyan retired his HRT into the garage due to vibrations in the car. Button, Massa and Vettel made pit stops on laps 35, 36 and 38 respectively, and all retained their positions in fourth, second and first, with Kobayashi in third. Michael Schumacher, who had started twenty-third and opted for a different tyre strategy, was left as the only driver on the softer tyres when he pitted on lap 37. He spent much of the remainder of the race behind the Toro Rosso of Daniel Ricciardo, fighting for tenth place, but never eventually gaining it due to some impressive defending. On lap 41, Charles Pic drove his Marussia into the pit garage with engine failure. Button spent the final stint of the race closing to within one second of Kobayashi, but never managing to overtake the Sauber driver.\nSebastian Vettel took the 24th victory of his career by twenty seconds and became the first driver to take consecutive victories in the 2012 season. It was also the second Grand Slam (pole, fastest lap, and lead every lap en route to victory) of Vettel's career. Felipe Massa ended the longest streak a Ferrari driver had ever had without a podium by finishing second, taking his first since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix. Kobayashi became the third Japanese driver to score a Formula One podium, in front of his home crowd, with his best result of third place. The McLaren cars of Button and Hamilton finished in fourth and fifth places, followed by Räikkönen, Hülkenberg, Maldonado (who took his fourth points scoring result and first since winning in Spain nearly five months earlier), Webber and Ricciardo who completed the top ten. Michael Schumacher and Paul di Resta (who had a clutch failure at the race start) just missed out in eleventh and twelfth. Romain Grosjean retired on the final lap due to a gearbox problem.\nPost-race.\nAs a consequence of his victory and Alonso's retirement, Vettel closed the gap between himself and championship leader to just four points. In an interview after the race, Mark Webber described Romain Grosjean as a \"first-lap nutcase\" with regard to the collision Grosjean caused between them at the race start.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Cycling at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's sprint",
        "text": "The men's sprint at the 2000 Summer Olympics (Cycling) was an event that consisted of cyclists making three laps around the track. Only the time for the last 200 metres of the 750 metres covered was counted as official time. The races were held on Monday, 18 September, Tuesday, 19 September, and Wednesday, 20 September 2000 at the Dunc Gray Velodrome. There were 19 competitors from 14 nations, with each nation limited to two cyclists. The event was won by Marty Nothstein of the United States, the nation's first victory in the men's sprint since 1984 and second overall. Nothstein was the seventh man to win multiple medals in the event. The silver medal went to Florian Rousseau, France's first medal in the event since 1980. Two-time defending champion Jens Fiedler of Germany lost to Nothstein in the semifinals, but won the bronze medal match to become the second man to win three medals in the event (Daniel Morelon won four from 1964 to 1976, still the record).\nBackground.\nThis was the 22nd appearance of the event, which has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1904 and 1912. Four of the quarterfinalists from 1996 returned: two-time defending champion Jens Fiedler of Germany, silver medalist Marty Nothstein of the United States, fifth-place finisher Darryn Hill of Australia, and eighth-place finisher Florian Rousseau of France. There was no clear favorite, though Fiedler, Nothstein, and Rousseau were among the top cyclists along with Laurent Gané of France. Rousseau had won the world championships in 1997 and 1998; Gané had won in 1999.\nFor the first time in the history of the event, no nations made their debut in the men's sprint. France made its 22nd appearance, the only nation to have competed at every appearance of the event.\nCompetition format.\nThis sprint competition involved a series of head-to-head matches along with the new qualifying round of time trials. There were five main match rounds, with two one-round repechages.\nRecords.\nThe records for the sprint are 200 metre flying time trial records, kept for the qualifying round in later Games as well as for the finish of races.\nNo new world or Olympic records were set during the competition.\nResults.\nQualifying round.\nHeld Monday, 18 September. Times and average speeds are listed. The fastest 18 riders advanced to the first round.\nRound 1.\nHeld Monday, 18 September. The first round consisted of nine heats of two riders each. Winners advanced to the next round, losers competed in the repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nHeld Monday, 18 September. The nine defeated cyclists from the first round took part in the 1/16 repechage (reduced to eight because of Peden not starting the first round). They raced in three heats of three riders each (with one heat of two riders, as Peden did not qualify for the repechage). The winner of each heat rejoined the nine victors of the first round in advancing to the 1/8 round.\n1/8 finals.\nHeld Monday, 18 September. The 1/8 round consisted of six matches, each pitting two of the twelve remaining cyclists against each other. The winners advanced to the quarterfinals, with the losers getting another chance in the 1/8 repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nHeld Monday, 18 September. The six cyclists defeated in the 1/8 round competed in the 1/8 repechage. Two heats of three riders were held. Winners rejoined the victors from the 1/8 round and advanced to the quarterfinals. The four other riders competed in the 9th through 12th place classification.\nQuarterfinals.\nHeld Tuesday, 19 September. The eight riders that had advanced to the quarterfinals competed pairwise in four matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races. All four quarterfinals matches were decided without a third race. Winners advanced to the semifinals, losers competed in a 5th to 8th place classification.\nSemifinals.\nHeld Wednesday, 20 September. The four riders that had advanced to the semifinals competed pairwise in two matches. Each match consisted of two races, with a potential third race being used as a tie-breaker if each cyclist won one of the first two races.

        "title": "Mote Park (cricket ground)",
        "text": "Mote Park, also known as The Mote, is a cricket ground in Maidstone in the English county of Kent. It is inside the grounds of the Mote Park and is owned by The Mote Cricket Club. The ground is also used by the Mote Squash Club and Maidstone rugby club. It was used by Kent County Cricket Club as one of their out-grounds for county cricket matches. The club played over 200 first-class cricket matches on the ground between 1859 and 2005.\nThe ground is located around south-east of the centre of Maidstone on the western fringe of Mote Park. The A229 road runs to the east of the ground, Maidstone Leisure Centre is immediately to the south of the ground and Maidstone Grammar School just south-west of the site. Originally the ground was separated from the urban area of Maidstone by farmland, but 20th century housing has been built up to the western edges of the site.\nEstablishment.\nThe ground was established in the mid-19th century inside Mote Park, at the time a country estate to the west of Maidstone. It had been emparked in the 14th century and by the end of the 17th century was owned by the Marsham family. Charles Marsham, 1st Earl of Romney built a new mansion in the grounds of the park in the 1790s and the grounds were redeveloped during the mid-19th century by both the 2nd and 3rd Earls.\nCricket was first played on a ground in the park in 1854 and the ground was established fully by 1857. The park was sold to Marcus Samuel, 1st Viscount Bearsted in 1895 and the ground developed extensively under his ownership to allow it to be used regularly for county cricket. The ground was levelled and the pitch turned through 90 degrees in 1907. The cricket pavilion and The Tabernacle, built as Viscount Bearsted's private pavilion, were built between 1909 and 1910.\nAfter the death of the 1st Viscount Bearsted in 1927, his son sold Mote Park itself to Maidstone Corporation, with the cricket ground being excluded from the sale and being gifted to The Mote. The Tabernacle was initially gifted to the Band of Brothers, a private cricket club closely associated with the county club, and eventually transferred to The Mote in the 1940s.\nCricket history.\nThe first known match at Mote Park was between Maidstone and an All-England XI in 1854, Maidstone playing with 18 batsmen. A Mote Park team first used the ground the following year.\nThe first match given retrospective first-class cricket status took place in 1859, Kent playing MCC. The county used the match twice in the 1860s before beginning to play more regularly on the ground in the 1870s. The ground saw several matches played by the amateur Gentlemen of Kent side during the 1860s and the Australian Aborigine team played there twice during their tour England in 1868. Other touring sides to have played at the ground include the Australians in 1890, 1912 and 1951 South Africans, 1954 Canadians and the New Zealanders in 1965 and 1969.\nOther than a break when the ground was re-laid in 1908 and 1909, Kent used the ground regularly for an annual cricket week until the end of the 2005 season. Over 200 first-class matches took place on the ground, with Kent also using it for limited overs cricket from 1969. It was removed from the list of county grounds used by Kent when an over-watered \"green\" wicket, prepared for a County Championship match against Gloucestershire, led to a low scoring game which ended after less than two days. The club was deducted eight points due to the state of the pitch.\nThe ground was also used by Kent's Second XI, including in the Second XI Championship, and by the Kent Cricket Board side in both List A cricket and the Minor Counties Trophy. The Kent Women cricket team first used the ground in 1936 and the ground was used by England Women XIs to play touring sides in 1937 and 1979, with one of the two matches taking place against the West Indies Women in 1979 being an official One Day International.\nRedevelopment of the facilities at the ground had been approved during 2005 as part of a larger scheme to increase the profile of cricket in the county town. Since 2005 The Mote Cricket Club have relaid a number of wickets at a cost of £14,000 with the help of grants and technical assistance from the County Cricket Club and Maidstone Borough Council. Kent have expressed a wish to return to the ground at some point, although as of April 2016 the quality of the wicket and the pavilion were still seen as issues that needed to be addressed.\nRecords on the ground.\nA total of 218 first-class matches were held on the ground between 1859 and 2005, all of them featuring Kent as the home side. Kent also played List A matches regularly on the ground, with 53 fixtures being played between 1969 and 2005. The Kent Cricket Board played another five List A matches on the ground in the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy between 1999 and 2002. Two of Kent's T20 matches were hosted at the ground in 2004.\nFirst-class cricket.\nThe partnership between de Silva and Cowdrey set a new record as the highest partnership for any wicket for Kent. It remained Kent's highest partnership in first-class cricket until 2017 when it was surpassed by Sean Dickson and Joe Denly who made 382 runs for the 2nd wicket against Northants at County Cricket Ground, Beckenham.\nIn 1910, Colin Blythe and Frank Woolley bowled unchanged throughout both innings of a fixture with Yorkshire repeating a performance from 1889, also against Yorkshire, by bowlers Walter Wright and Fred Martin.\nList A cricket.\nIn 1995 Mark Ealham set a record for the fastest century in 40-over cricket. In 44 balls, Ealham scored a hundred, with nine sixes and nine fours. This remained the Kent record for the fastest century in List A cricket until Darren Stevens equalled the record in 2013.\nTwenty20 Cricket.\nTwo Twenty20 matches were played on the ground in 2004. Kent made the highest T20 score on the ground, scoring 157/3 against Middlesex who made 155/7 in reply. The match was reduced by rain to 18 overs per side. Middlesex batted first and Kent reached their target in only 13.1 overs. Andrew Symonds scored 112 runs in the match, the only T20 century scored on the ground. Symonds scored his century in 34 balls, at the time a record for the fastest century in T20 cricket. As of March 2018 it remains the third quickest century scored in top-level T20 matches worldwide and the fastest scored in the UK.\nThe best bowling figures in a T20 match on the ground were 4 wickets for 20 runs from 3.2 overs by Scott Brant for Essex in the grounds other T20 match.\nOther uses.\nAs of 2018, the ground is the current home of Maidstone FC who have played rugby union on it since the 1950s. The redevelopment of parts of the ground is likely to mean that the rugby club moves to a new ground in the future.\nThe ground is also the home to The Mote Squash Club."

The second jointly hosted edition in the competition's history took place in Hungary and Croatia from 7 to 21 December 2014.\nNorway won their sixth title after beating Spain 28–25 in the final. Sweden defeated Montenegro 25–23 to capture the bronze medal.\nNorway's victory ensured their qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics. However, they later won the 2015 World Women's Handball Championship, vacating the European champion Olympic berth which fell to Spain as the runner-up. The two next-best placed teams, Sweden and Montenegro, earned spots in the Olympic Qualification Tournaments.\nHost selection.\nInitially there were two applicants for the tournament, Slovenia and Turkey, with none of them having the experience of organizing a continental event before. However, both candidates withdrew their offers later, thus the host nation could not be selected on the 10th Ordinary EHF Congress between 24 and 25 September 2010 as it was planned.\nInstead, the European Handball Federation re-launched the bidding process. As a result, six federations (Croatia, Hungary, Iceland, Slovakia, Sweden and Turkey) showed intention to host the championship. Until the final deadline of 28 January 2011, EHF received three bids from four federations:\nAfter a thorough analysis, Slovakia was excluded from the race first, as they failed to ensure a minimum of four arenas that meet the strict criteria for the European Championship. The EHF Executive Committee decided between the two remaining aspirants on its meeting on 9 April 2011, awarding the right to host the 11th Women's EHF European Handball Championship to Hungary and Croatia.\nSeeding.\nThe draw was held on 19 June 2014 at 13:00 local time in Zagreb, Croatia.\nReferees.\n12 referee pairs were selected:\nPreliminary round.\nThe playing schedule was released on 4 June 2014.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nMain round.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nKnockout stage.\nBracket.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nFinal ranking.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAwards.\nThe all-star team and awards were announced on 21 December 2014."

        "text": "W.A.K.O. World Championships 2007 in Belgrade were the joint 16th edition of the W.A.K.O. world championships - the second event would be held later that year in Coimbra, Portugal. They were for amateur male and female kickboxers and covered the following categories; K-1, Low-Kick and Light-Contact. Weight classes for men ranged from light bantamweight (51 kg or 112 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.6 lb), while the women's ranged from featherweight (52 kg or 114.6 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). More information on the categories, weight classes and rules is provided in the various sections below. In total there were 1085 athletes at the championships, representing sixty countries including China (taking part for the first time), fighting in 49 tournaments. The Belgrade championships were held at the Pionir Hall in Belgrade, Serbia from Monday, September 24 to Monday, October 1, 2007.\nK-1.\nW.A.K.O.'s K-1 category uses the same rules set by the K-1 organization and combine a mixture of techniques from Muay Thai, Karate, western boxing and other forms of stand up fighting. The main difference between K-1 rules and other forms of kickboxing is the use of the clinch and knees – which have recently been limited to one knee per clinch. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (any part) and foot/feet (sweeps only). As mentioned before fighters are also allowed to knees (only one hand to clinch and one knee strike per clinch) and can use the back fist/spinning back fist technique. Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and shots to the groin. Techniques involving elbows are also illegal. Due to the amateur nature of W.A.K.O. championships all fighters must wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves. \nEach fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges who score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. As with other forms, illegal strikes may result in a point(s) deduction or even disqualification. Unlike Full-Contact and Low-Kick it is not necessary for the minimum six kicks per round to be counte. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on K-1 rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.\nWeight classes in K-1 at Belgrade were similar to that of the Low-Kick category, with the men having eleven weight classes from bantamweight (54 kg or 118.8 lb) to super heavyweight (over 90 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six beginning at featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) and ending super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb). Belarus was the most successful nation in K-1 winning five gold, three silver and five bronze in both the male and female categories. \nLow-Kick.\nLow-Kick is similar to Full-Contact kickboxing only that as well as allowing kicks and punches to the head and body, it also allows clean kicks to be made to opponents legs. Attacks that are legal include strikes to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side), leg (thigh) and foot/feet (sweeps only). Strikes that are illegal include attacks to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and the groin. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard gloves.\nA minimum of six kicks must be thrown each round or points may be deducted by the referee. Each fight is three, two minute rounds and is scored by three judges. The judges will score successful (legal) strikes that are not blocked, and are thrown with full power. Illegal moves may result in points deduction or if repeated, disqualification. In the event of a draw after three rounds the judges will base the victor on who was stronger in the final round, or failing that will use their remarks from each round to deduce who wins. Victory can be achieved by a point's decision, technical knockout or knockout, abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). If a fighter is knocked down three times in the fight he will automatically lose via technical knockout. More detail on Low-Kick rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.\nAt Belgrade the men's Low-Kick competition had twelve six weight classes starting at light bantamweight (51 kg or 112.2 lb) to super heavyweight (over 91 kg or 200.2 lb), while the women's had six ranging from featherweight (52 kg or 114.4 lb) to super heavyweight (over 70 kg or 154 lb), while . As with Light-Contact, by the championships end, Russia was the strongest nation, having won an impressive haul of six gold, two silver and two bronze medals. \nLight-Contact.\nIn this form of kickboxing fighters are scored on their ability to land controlled and clean strikes with an emphasis put on style over power. Fighters that fight too aggressively may be cautioned by the referee and, if the offence is repeated, may be disqualified, although strikes that are too light (such as a push or brush) will not be scored either. Attacks are allowed to the head (front, side and forehead), the torso (front and side) and leg (foot sweeps). As mentioned before excessive force is illegal as well as strikes to the top of the head, the back, the top of the shoulders, the neck and below the belt. Light-Contact is seen as the intermediate stage between Semi and Full-Contact kickboxing involving more physicality than Semi but less so than Full. All fighters are required to wear protection for their head, teeth, breast (women only) groin, shin and feet, and must fight with the standard 10oz gloves.\nFighters score the following points for landing a controlled strike on their opponent; punch, kick to body, foot sweep (1 point), kick to head, jumping kick to body (2 points), jumping kick to head (3 points). Each fight is three, two-minute rounds and is scored by three judges. In the event of a draw the match will be scored electronically. Victory can be achieved by points decision, technical knockout (usually when one fighter is so dominant the referee is forced to stop the contest), abandonment (when one fighter gives up), disqualification or by a walkover (other fighter is unable to participate). More detail on Light-Contact rules can be found at the official W.A.K.O. website.\nLight-Contact uses slightly different weight classes from Low-Kick and K-1. At Belgrade the men had nine weight classes, starting at 57 kg or 125.4 lb and ending at over 94 kg (206.8 lb), while the women's Light-Contact competition had five weight classes beginning at 55 kg (121 lb) and ending at over 70 kg (154 lb). At the end of the championships, Russia was the most successful nation in Light-Contact having won five gold and two silver medals.\nOverall Medals Standing (Top 5).\nThe nation that came out on top at the W.A.K.O. Amateur World Championships 2007 in Belgrade were Russia who amassed fourteen gold, ten silvers and ten bronze medals in all categories, both male and female."

He signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates upon graduation on June 16 and made his Major League debut three days later against the St. Louis Cardinals at Sportsman's Park, substituting for starting catcher Mike Sandlock and singling in two at bats against Vinegar Bend Mizell. He also made two errors in the field. He spent part of the 1953 season in minor league baseball, playing in 84 games for the Denver Bears of the Class A Western League and batting .324, before returning to the Pirates for good from 1954–1956.\nThe Pirates of the mid-1950s were at one of the low ebbs of their history. Shepard's 1954–1956 clubs averaged 94 losses (against only 60 wins) per season. Despite their struggles, and his first-game jitters in 1953, Shepard gained a reputation as a stalwart defensive player, batted .304 in his first full season (when he was named Pirates' rookie of the year and selected to The Sporting News' all-rookie team) and became one of the team leaders. His 1956 manager, Bobby Bragan, said of him, \"Shepard was the most intelligent catcher I've known. He handled pitchers well and could throw. He was good on plays at the plate. Fearless.\"\nBut Shepard's off-seasons were spent continuing his education at Stanford, where he obtained master's degrees in business and education. After serving as Pittsburgh's regular catcher in 1956, appearing in a career-high 100 games, he announced his retirement to become development director at his alma mater and begin a full-time career in business. All told, he played in 278 MLB games, and collected 195 hits.\nHe served as president and chief executive of a San Francisco-area telecommunications firm and a baseball equipment and indoor baseball and entertainment center company, and was a management consultant as well as a philanthropist on behalf of multiple Palo Alto, California-area institutions. He was a member of the Stanford and Fresno County athletic halls of fame.\nJack Shepard died at age 63 from cancer in Atherton, California."

        "text": "Clash of the Codes was a special two match inter-code series between rugby union side Bath and rugby league side Wigan, played in May 1996. Other Clash of Codes games have also taken place.\nBackground.\nIn 1895, most rugby clubs in the North of England broke away from the governing body of Rugby football, the Rugby Football Union, and formed a rival body, the Northern Rugby Football Union (later renamed the Rugby Football League) over the issue of payments to players. This \"Great Schism\" led to the creation of two forms of Rugby football - rugby union governed by the Rugby Football Union and rugby league overseen by the Rugby Football League.\n100 years later in August 1995, the International Rugby Board announced that rugby union was to be an \"open\" game, ending the prohibition of payments to players. In January 1996, an announcement was made that Bath FC, at that time the dominant club side in English rugby union, and Wigan RLFC, similarly the country's dominant rugby league side, would meet in a two-game, cross-code challenge series that would see both clubs playing to each other's set of laws.\nThe cross-code challenge met with lukewarm support from both the Rugby Football Union and the Rugby Football League. The dates for the games were set for May 1996, which was the end of the domestic rugby union season, but was only a few weeks into the rugby league season (rugby league having made the switch to being a summer game that year). The date for the proposed game under union rules clashed with Wigan's Super League game against the Sheffield Eagles, while the RFU stated that Twickenham would be unavailable to stage the game when they were approached by Bath due to their plans to reseed the pitch. Both clubs had agreed that, to maximise the potential attendances, the two games should be held at venues other than their own stadia (the Recreation Ground and Central Park). However, when word came out that Cardiff Arms Park had offered to stage the union game instead, the RFU decided to postpone the pitch reseeding and offer Twickenham as the venue. Maine Road, the home of Manchester City, and a regular venue for major rugby league games at the time, was chosen to host the game to be played under league rules.\nThe teams.\nBath.\nEntering the new professional era, Bath were the dominant club in England. Since the beginning of the league structure in rugby union in 1987, the club had won six Courage League titles, while also winning a total of ten JPS/Pilkington Cups since that competition was started in 1972. The club also provided a sizeable number of players to the England team, including the then newly appointed England captain Phil de Glanville.\nWigan.\nThe beginning of the new Super League era in rugby league saw Wigan still at the top of rugby league. The team had just won the last winter RFL championship, their seventh consecutive title, while they had lost in the Challenge Cup for the first time in almost a decade, having won their eighth consecutive final in April 1995. As with Bath, Wigan provided a significant number of players to the Great Britain national team.\nRugby league game.\nBuild-up.\nFive days prior to the rugby league game, Bath had won the Pilkington Cup in a hard-fought match up against Leicester that they had won 16–15, thus achieving a league and cup double, having won the Courage League title the week before. As a consequence, Bath had little opportunity to prepare for the game at Maine Road, with a single warm up game under league rules against South Wales. By contrast, Wigan had a relatively quiet build up; the Challenge Cup final, played the week before, was the first not to feature the club for a decade, allowing the players a week without a game. The day after Bath's Pilkington Cup final, Wigan played a Super League game at home to Paris Saint-Germain, which they won 76–8.\nThe game.\nBath got off to a bad start from the kick-off, when Jon Callard failed to make his kick go the required 10 metres. Within 90 seconds of the kick-off, Martin Offiah touched down for Wigan, but was penalised for a foot in touch. However, with only three minutes gone, Offiah scored the first of his six tries of the night. The difficulties that Bath had with coming to terms with the game led to further tries for Offiah (2), Henry Paul, Jason Robinson, Terry O'Connor, Andy Johnson, Craig Murdock and Scott Quinnell, with the score at half-time 52–0. The first half proved to be such a mismatch that it was more than fifteen minutes before Bath were able to get through a set of tackles without making an error.\nBath were able to get into the game more after half-time and, following O'Connor's second try for Wigan, got on the scoresheet through Callard touching down and converting. This though led to a further period of sustained pressure from Wigan that led to a further six tries from the reigning champions and a final score of 82–6 in favour of Wigan.\nRugby union game.\nBuild-up.\nWigan's dominance in the first game led to some suggesting that they would be able to complete a 'double' over Bath. However, Wigan captain Shaun Edwards related that, following the end of the first game, Bath forward Nigel Redman had told him of his relish at the prospect of the second meeting, with a realisation that Redman \"couldn't wait to get...in the scrums\". Two and a half weeks separated the rugby league game from the return match under union rules at Twickenham. In that time, Wigan played two league games away to Halifax and Workington Town, as well as organising practice games under union rules against Orrell. Prior to these, the club became the first rugby league side to play at Twickenham when they sent a strong squad to take part in the Middlesex Sevens, a tournament that they went on to win, beating Wasps in the final.\nWith Bath having won the league and cup double, and the domestic season concluded prior to the first game, they were able to concentrate on the preparation for the second encounter.\nThe game.\nBath again kicked the game off, but this time, rather than conceding a penalty, Jon Callard's kick enabled Martin Haag to take and recycle the ball, allowing Bath's forwards an early opportunity to ruck and maul against opponents unused to this type of play, with Wigan failing to win any of the first twenty rucks. Only a Bath knock-on during the drive prevented a repeat of the first game and an early try for the experts. What this meant though was the Wigan pack engaging in a union scrum early on, and coming to terms with the differences of this compared with a typically uncontested scrum in their own game. Indeed, it was through scrummaging inexperience that Wigan conceded their first try, a penalty try given through their repeated collapsing of the scrum. It was 18 minutes until Wigan handled the ball in the opposition half, with Bath gaining further tries through Adedayo Adebayo (2) and Jon Sleightholme prior to half-time, allowing the Courage League champions to build an unanswered 25-point lead at the break. Jonathan Davies, the dual-code international, made the observation that Wigan were suffering from constant infringements of \"rules they didn't know existed\".\nAs in the first game, the second half followed a similar pattern to begin with, Mike Catt and Phil de Glanville scoring early, and the likelihood coming of a score of similar dimensions. However, as the second half progressed, Bath's players began to tire and allowed gaps to open up for Wigan to exploit. Craig Murdock scored a pair of tries that went the length of the field, while Va'aiga Tuigamala got a third before Ian Sanders got Bath's seventh with a pushover from the pack. Unlike the first game, the second half of the second game saw the visitors match the home side for points to leave a final score of 44–19 in Bath's favour.\nAftermath.\nAlthough played in some quarters as the start of a great coming together of the two codes, most people saw the \"cross-code challenge\" as primarily a commercial exercise. Wigan, having lost out on the income generated by a run in the Challenge Cup, were looking for ways to regain that, while Bath were in the process of making the transition into a fully professional outfit. That being said, the series did allow Bath to be exposed to a professional rugby team, with all of the consequences for fitness, strength and pace in rugby union.\nAlthough Bath were evidently outmatched in the first game, they were able to take some positives; Phil de Glanville made the most tackles of any back on either side, while de Glanville, Steve Ojomoh, Jon Callard and Adedayo Adebayo all impressed watching league experts. Similarly, in the second game, as Bath tired, Wigan were able to exploit both their superior fitness and their superior running game to gain a foothold during the second half. However, one of Bath's star players at the time, England centre Jeremy Guscott, refused to play in the series, as he felt that there was a lack of balance between the two games - the only alteration that took place in the league fixture came at half-time when Bath requested unlimited substitutions (rather than the fixed number of ten interchanges normally permitted); apart from this, the match was played as a standard, full intensity game of rugby league. In the union fixture however, although there was a greater intensity to the scrummaging than league players would normally experience, the scrums were not fully contested, as scrummaging in rugby union is highly technical, particularly in the front row. Had the scrums been fully contested, Guscott stated that it was likely a number of the Wigan forwards could have been seriously injured. But, this meant that Wigan were able to gain more of a foothold in the union fixture than Bath had been able to do in the league fixture.\nFollowing the transition of rugby union to professionalism, and the ending of the ban on players that had played rugby league from playing the game, a number of notable rugby league players chose to take up short-term contracts with clubs in the Courage League during the Super League close-season. A number of Wigan's players from the cross-code series undertook such moves, including Jason Robinson and Henry Paul who turned out for Bath, as well as Martin Offiah, Va'aiga Tuigamala and Gary Connolly. Some later made permanent moves to the 15-a-side game, with Tuigamala's transfer to Newcastle Falcons for £1m being a world record, while Robinson became a mainstay of the England rugby union team, winning the World Cup in 2003, as well as becoming the first player to win both league's Super League and union's Premiership titles (with Wigan and Sale respectively).\nThe cross-code challenge occurred while both Bath and Wigan were in the twilight of their time at the top of their respective rugby football codes. Wigan's great rivals St. Helens won the first Super League title in 1996 and, although Wigan won the first grand final in 1998, and got to three subsequent Grand Finals, they would not win another league title until 2010. Bath meanwhile won the 1998 Heineken Cup, becoming the first English team to do so, as well as the 2008 European Challenge Cup, but have failed to win a domestic trophy since the 1996 Pilkington Cup, with their position at the summit of the English game taken by their fierce rivals Leicester.\nThe two match series was the beginning of a thaw in relations between rugby union and rugby league. The success of Wigan's two visits to Twickenham, for both the game against Bath and the Middlesex Sevens, led to the RFU offering to play host to the Challenge Cup Final in the event of Wembley, the event's traditional home, not being available. The RFL eventually took them up on this offer, with both the 2001 and 2006 finals taking place at the home of Rugby Union. Twickenham was also the venue for the opening game of the 2000 Rugby League World Cup between England and Australia, the first time the 13-a-side game had been played there, while games during that tournament were also played at Kingsholm and Stradey Park, both bastions of club rugby union. Bradford Bulls then followed Wigan's lead by participating in and winning the Middlesex Sevens in 2002. Similarly, rugby union has also on occasion decamped into the northern heartlands of rugby league; in 1998, England played two qualifying games for the 1999 Rugby World Cup at the Alfred McAlpine Stadium in Huddersfield, which also hosted a game during the final tournament. England have also played twice at Old Trafford, the traditional home of the Super League Grand Final. However, possibly the most notable event came in 1998 when Leeds Rhinos RLFC and Leeds Tykes RUFC merged to form Leeds Rugby Limited, described as \"the world's first dual code rugby partnership\". Although there are separate teams in both codes, they are owned by a common organisation with a single board."

        "text": "Middlesex Rugby is the governing body for rugby union in Middlesex, England; Middlesex is a historic county of England that covers areas in the ceremonial counties of Greater London, Surrey and Hertfordshire. The historic county is still in use when referring to sport, and some businesses in the area. Middlesex RFU was originally created as the Middlesex County Rugby Club but within six years was being referred to as the Middlesex County Rugby Football Union and is now known simply as Middlesex Rugby.\nHistory.\nFR Adams Esq of Richmond F.C. called a meeting at the Bedford Hotel at which a resolution was passed bringing the club into being. He served as the Club and Union's first president until 1883 being succeeded by E. Temple Gurdon (also of Richmond F.C.).\nMiddlesex Sevens.\nThe world-famous Middlesex Sevens were organised by Dr. Russell-Cargill and the Middlesex Hon. Secretary CS Bongard, the first tournament taking place according to one source in 1925 and others in 1926. This was the first seven-a-side rugby festival in England. The first tournament took place at Twickenham in aid of Middlesex hospital was won by Harlequins.\nUnion officials.\nPast Presidents.\n\"Asterisk denotes President of the R.F.U.\"&lt;br&gt;\n\"Two asterisks denotes member of the International Rugby Board\"\nCounty side.\nMiddlesex County Rugby Union was originally created as a rugby club and as such fulfilled fixtures for six years before becoming the Union for clubs within the county. After becoming a union the club continued to operate selecting players from its constituent clubs to play representative matches for the county and to go on tours.\nVery early in its history, Middlesex played Surrey under floodlights at the Old Deer Park. This is possibly the first rugby match played under floodlights as electric light had only just been invented. A floodlit game was the ideal opportunity to try out the new technology although the game was not a great success by all accounts.\nOn 24 October 1905, Middlesex played the touring South African side at Richmond for their ninth match. The Springboks won 9 – 0, their narrowest score so far in the tour; a penalty by Douglas Morkel and try by Brink made the half time score 6 – 0 whilst in the second half the only points came from a try by Loubser. Middlesex fielded a cosmopolitan team including Jim Louwrens the South African College scrum half of 1901, three Welshmen who were also later to play for Wales (Harding, Jenkins &amp; Williams) and the Scottish international Geddes. The match referee was Cartwright.\nOn 2 September 1964 Staines RFC played a Middlesex XV on the occasion of the opening of their new ground, \"The Reeves\".\n1968 tour of East Africa.\nMiddlesex were the English county champions for the sixth time in 1968, having defeated Warwickshire in the final (tries by Brian Stoneman and Sandy Hinshelwood helped them to their 9–6 win at Twickenham). At least ten of the players that had participated in the final went on the tour in July of that year. Middlesex played a total of seven matches on a tour that lasted a little over two weeks, two games being played in Uganda and five in Kenya. The tourists won all seven matches comfortably and reported that the standard of rugby in the region had dropped noticeably since some members of the touring party had last played there. It was generally felt that the East African sides lacked stamina and tactical nous; the latter is understandable as the opportunities for playing high level rugby in the region were limited, though the former is surprising as much of the region is at altitude and it would be expected that the visitors would suffer more than the hosts.\nThe Middlesex tour party consisted of 70 members though the minority of these were players, the majority were officials and non-playing members who were travelling as supporters. Amongst the players, at least three had previously toured East Africa; Patrick Orr (twice, with Anti-Assassins in 1965 and Richmond F. C. in 1963), Chris Ralston (with Richmond F. C. in 1963) and Brian Stoneman (twice, with Richmond F. C. and Combined (Oxford and Cambridge) Universities, both in 1963).\nMiddlesex scored 262 points in seven matches, an average of more than 37 per game. In total they conceded only 14 points. They scored 61 tries, 32 conversions, three penalty-goals and two dropped-goals. Top scorer was Gordon MacDonald (45 points, all from goal-kicking), Ricky Parsons was second highest scorer (33 points, from 5 tries, the rest from goal-kicking), Mike Alder was third (31 points from 6 tries, the rest from goal-kicking). Top try scorers were Tim Rutter and Robin Jolliffe (7 each), Mike Alder and Roger Weaver (6 each). Francis Mann was the outstanding player of the tour.\nThe tour had been organised by the Middlesex Hon. Secretary Barry Boyden, his assistant Cyril Brandon and the RFUEA's appointed Tour Chairman Bernard Nicholls. As with all rugby tours to East Africa in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, it would not have been possible without the hosting arrangements offered by the rugby fraternity in Kenya and Uganda; in order to cut down on costs, members of the tour party were welcomed into the homes of the hosts and provided for in a manner that was acclaimed by those that were lucky enough to have toured the region. Hence the frequency with which first time tourists rapidly made certain they returned a second or third time.\nNotable players.\nThese players have played test rugby.\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 88 clubs affiliated with the Middlesex RFU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level. All these clubs are based in Greater London – in what used to be the historic county of Middlesex, although a large number of clubs are also members of the Surrey RFU.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Middlesex RFU currently helps run the following competitions for clubs based in the historic county of Middlesex (now part of London):"

The second event was additionally blighted by an error in the navigational notes which saw the majority of the field become lost in the Algerian Sahara desert.

        "title": "Somerset County Cricket Club in 1885",
        "text": "The 1885 season was an \"annus horribilis\" for Somerset County Cricket Club. Captained by Ted Sainsbury, who had taken over from Stephen Newton, captain for the previous three seasons, they played six first-class cricket matches. Somerset's only win of the season came in their first match; all the other were lost. Two of the losses, those away against Gloucestershire and Surrey, number among the county's ten heaviest defeats. Somerset were unable to field a full team for their fourth match, which coupled with their poor results and lack of fixtures resulted in the club being stripped of its first-class status at the end of the season.\nAt an emergency meeting held in Taunton a new club secretary was appointed and wealthy benefactors were sought, but Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. Somerset played second-class cricket for five seasons, until their readmission to the first-class game for the 1891 season.\nIn their histories of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter Roebuck and David Foot mostly gloss over the season; Roebuck includes a scorecard, but provides only two paragraphs of prose, while Foot only mentions the loss of first-class cricket.\nBackground.\nSomerset had been granted first-class status in advance of the 1882 season. Their maiden season at the top level was described by \"Wisden\" as disastrous, but the publication qualified this statement with mild optimism for 1883. The county failed to live up to this optimism, and although there were a few wins, performances on the whole were poor. Twice between 1882 and 1884 Somerset's opponents scored over 500 runs in an innings against them, and against Lancashire in 1884 they fielded only ten players. Stephen Newton, who had captained the side since 1882, left the club at the end of the 1884 season, and thereafter played all his cricket in London.\nSquad.\nIn their six first-class matches in 1885, Somerset fielded 26 different players. Only two appeared in all six matches: the captain Edward Sainsbury, and Charles Winter. \"James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual\" suggested in 1883 that \"professionals not being indigenous to the area [Somerset] it is feared that their advance is only temporary\". This prediction was particularly accurate during 1885: only Albert Clapp was a professional. Ten of Somerset's players that year only appeared once during the season, and of those, all but George Mirehouse, Crescens Robinson, and Francis Terry, made fewer than five career first-class appearances.\nThe following players made at least one appearance for Somerset in first-class cricket in 1885. Age given is at the start of Somerset's first match of the season (16 July 1885).\nCounty cricket.\nDuring 1885 Somerset suffered badly from their lack of a strong bowling attack. Playing six matches, there were a total of 120 wickets on offer, but Somerset's bowlers took only 67. Edward Bastard, a slow left-arm orthodox bowler, was the county's leading wicket-taker, claiming 25 wickets during his four appearances, at an average of 15.32. His bowling average was not far below that of George Lohmann, who finished the season as the country's leading wicket taker, with 142 wickets from his 24 matches. Unfortunately for Somerset, Bastard was only able to play in four of the county's six matches, and of the other bowlers, the best bowling average was the 25.85 managed by Bill Roe, who took only seven wickets. Charles Winter, who took the next highest total of wickets, only managed to claim 15 in his 6 appearances. Batting was the strongest aspect of Somerset's play, but the club lacked the strength-in-depth of other county teams. Herbie Hewett, playing his second season of first-class cricket, finished with the highest batting average for the county with 35.28, a respectable average which exceeded a number of England Test batsmen that season. Only four Somerset batsman passed 50 runs in an innings – Hewett, Octavius Radcliffe, Bill Roe, and Charles Winter – and only Radcliffe advanced to reach a century during the season.\nSomerset's first match of 1885 commenced on 16 July 1885, over two months after Nottinghamshire faced Sussex and Surrey travelled to Hampshire to open the first-class county cricket season in England. Somerset began their season at home against Hampshire, and after losing the toss were asked to field. Somerset's bowlers restricted the visitors to 175 runs in the first innings, during which Bastard took a career-best eight wickets in the innings, conceding 54 runs (eight for 54) off his 38 four-ball overs. In reply, Somerset fell short of equalling their opponents and were bowled out for 153, Radcliffe top-scoring with 51 runs. Bastard collected another three wickets in the second innings, granting him one of two career ten-wicket hauls, and Winter took four as Somerset bowled Hampshire out for 111, leaving themselves needing 134 to win. None of Somerset's top four batsmen reached 20 runs, but an unbeaten 50 from Hewett, accompanied by 32 from the number seven, Farrant Reed, helped Somerset achieve a five-wicket victory.\nFor their next match Somerset travelled to Moreton-in-Marsh, where they faced Gloucestershire. Bastard did not take part in the match, and it fell to Winter to bowl the majority of the overs in his absence. Along with his fellow opener, James Parfitt, Winter claimed three wickets, but both openers conceded over 100 runs for their wickets. Sainsbury tried eight different bowlers in an effort to take wickets, and Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 448 after 190 overs. In reply, Somerset conceded their first three wickets for 18 runs, before a brief revival took them to 61 for 3. The last seven wickets then fell for the addition of 39 more runs, and Somerset closed on 100, still trailing their opponents by overs 300 runs. Captain Edward Sainsbury top-scored for Somerset, reaching his highest total of the season, 40, and only two other batsmen reached double figures for the county: Parfitt and the professional, Albert Clapp. Five Somerset players fell for ducks. Asked by Gloucestershire to follow on, Somerset batted even more poorly in their second effort, in which Winter's total of 21 was the highest score. A total of 80 meant that they lost the match by an innings and 268 runs, their heaviest defeat in first-class cricket at that point.\nThe county had just four days to rest and recover from their loss before facing Surrey at The Oval. Bastard was again unavailable for Somerset, and after losing the toss once more, Somerset spent the whole of the first day in the field. Surrey accumulated 564 runs during that day, and reached 635 before Somerset claimed the tenth wicket to close the innings. At that stage, Maurice Read remained at the crease, having scored 186 not out, his highest score in first-class cricket. The Somerset opening bowlers, Winter and Parfitt, had both conceded in excess of 100 runs for the second match in a row. Sainsbury had utilised one less bowler than against Gloucestershire in his search for wickets, and claimed four of the wickets himself, recording a career-best four for 74. Hewett, whom he asked to bowl 30 overs, finished with 11 maiden overs. The 30 overs he bowled in the match accounted for over a quarter of all his bowling in first-class cricket. In reply to Surrey's total, Somerset were bowled out for 83 in their first innings, in which only John Challen and Crescens Robinson reached double figures, scoring 29 and 12 respectively. Clapp is recorded as \"absent hurt\" in both of Somerset's innings. In the second innings, Somerset were much improved, reaching 251, their highest batting total of the season. Radcliffe scored the county's only century of the season, scoring 101, and he shared a partnership of 129 with Hewett for the fourth wicket. Hewett reached his own highest score of the season, totalling 85. Nevertheless, Somerset's loss was even heavier than that suffered a week earlier, losing by an innings and 301 runs. As of March 2011, both of these back-to-back losses remain among the ten heaviest experienced by the county in first-class cricket.\nSomerset had just over a week off before their next match, for which they travelled to the County Ground, Southampton to face Hampshire once more. Possibly due to their losses in the previous two matches, Somerset could only field nine men in the fixture, a situation which Roebuck described as shameful. For the first time that season, Somerset batted first. They scored 117, and a contemporary match report praised the batting of Winter and Radcliffe, who scored 22 and 34 respectively in the first innings. Bastard \"did a capital performance in the first innings of Hants, taking eight of the ten wickets at a cost of only 59 runs\", according to the same report. Despite his efforts, Hampshire exceeded Somerset's total, opening up a 45-run lead from the first innings. Winter top-scored for Somerset in their second innings, reaching his highest total in first-class cricket, 62, after opening the batting. Scores in the 20s from Radcliffe and Egerton Hall helped take Somerset to 166, but Hampshire reached the total required for victory with a day of the match remaining, winning by eight wickets.\nSurrey visited the County Ground, Taunton a few days later for the counties' second meeting of the season. In a repeat of their previous fixtures, Surrey won the toss and chose to bat. Bastard, who had not played in their earlier clash, opened the bowling for Somerset alongside John Challen. Bastard, presumably due to the weakness of the rest of the county's attack, bowled 50 overs, but he could not repeat the successes he had achieved against Hampshire, toiling to take two for 99. All of Somerset's six bowlers in that innings claimed a wicket as Surrey were bowled out for 292. In reply, Radcliffe occupied the crease as the batsmen at the other end came and went, scoring exactly half of Somerset's 164. Roe, Sainsbury and Hewett all reached double figures, but four Somerset batsmen were dismissed for ducks. Requested to follow on, Somerset fared less well in their second innings: Roe reached 43, but no other batsman passed 20, and Somerset were all out for 123, five runs short of forcing Surrey to bat again.\nSomerset were the hosts once more for their final match of the season, played with just a single day off after the Surrey match, and that only because the scheduled three-day match was concluded in two days. The home side won the toss and elected to bat first against Gloucestershire, who opened the bowling with and William Woof. The pair bowled unchanged for 30 overs each, and claimed five wickets apiece as Somerset were dismissed for 105. Only Frederick Smith and Challen reached double figures, scoring 37 and 39. In response, Gloucestershire totalled 242, during which Bastard claimed four wickets, three of them from the tail. Somerset batted admirably in their second innings, with Roe and Hewett both scoring half-centuries (76 and 66 respectively), and they reached 246, six of the wickets falling to Woof, who collected eleven in the match. Gloucestershire achieved victory for the loss of just one wicket in their second innings, subjecting Somerset to their fifth successive loss.\nAftermath.\nSomerset were stripped of their first-class status for three reasons: they had not organised and played enough first-class fixtures during the season, their performances were not what was expected from a first-class county, and they had not succeeded in fielding a full side of eleven players in all their matches. An emergency meeting was held in Taunton during which a new club secretary was appointed, rules were altered, and wealthy benefactors were sought. Despite these widespread changes, Sainsbury retained the club captaincy. Somerset played second-class cricket for five seasons, finishing as \"second-class county champions\" in 1890, after which they were readmitted to the first-class game."

        "title": "England rugby union try record progression",
        "text": "The England rugby union try record progression charts the record number of tries scored for the England national rugby union team by individual players, or rugby footballers as they are still sometimes referred to.\nEarly years.\nThe progression begins with Reg Birkett's try, scored in the first international rugby match of any code in 1871 when England succumbed to Scotland at Raeburn Place. When Birkett's try was scored, it was not worth any points in itself, but rather afforded the opportunity of the scoring side to kick a goal, or a \"try at goal\", which England failed to convert. Birkett, who also played association football for England, was for a short time during the match the joint international record holder as well, matching Angus Buchanan's earlier effort for Scotland. Despite the record being but a single try, Birkett's mark of one try for England stood for almost six years, although this equated at the time to just ten matches. In that time, at least a further eleven players matched the feat of scoring a try for England before William Hutchinson scored his second try of the match and his career in the eleventh England match on 5 February 1877. Hutchinson set a mark that was to last for exactly four years when Henry Taylor, who had already equalled the record, scored three times against Ireland on 5 February 1881. Taylor played in the same side as another prolific scorer of tries, George Burton. Burton equalled the mark of five tries in England's comprehensive victory over Wales in the latter's first international. In that match, on 19 February 1881, of the thirteen tries scored, Taylor scored once but Burton scored four times, which was in itself a record haul for one match that was to last until 1907. The tries scored in this match brought both players to six apiece, but as to which of these players reached that mark first is unclear. It was not until 1885 that another pairing of prolific try scorers, Wilfred Bolton and Charles Wade, both equalled the haul of six tries. Wade went on to hold the record outright for over fifteen years after he scored his seventh try on 2 January 1886 against Wales. It was Tot Robinson that was to break this record on 9 March 1901 with his mark of eight tries and no one challenged this until Arthur Hudson equalled and then broke it at Parc des Princes when England defeated France on 3 March 1910. For the third time, England was fielding a pairing of prolific try scorers, and alongside Hudson was John Birkett. John Birkett was the son of England's first try scorer, Reg Birkett and had scored the first try at Twickenham Stadium. He went on to set the England record with ten tries on 8 April 1912.\nLowe's sixty-seven year record.\nAs Birkett's career finished, the young winger, Cyril Lowe, began his. Lowe was selected to play for England whilst still at university in 1913 and despite a six-year break due to the First World War when he flew as a fighter pilot in the Royal Flying Corps, returned to international duty and resumed scoring tries. Lowe scored eighteen times in twenty four appearances, and set the record for the most tries scored in a single Five Nations Championship when he scored eight in 1914, a record only matched by Ian Smith of Scotland, and never surpassed, even in the Six Nations era with its greater number of matches. Despite living until the age of 91, Lowe's mark of eighteen tries, set on 10 February 1923, outlasted him and was not broken until another RAF fighter pilot, Rory Underwood, scored his nineteenth try almost sixty-seven years later on 20 January 1990. Underwood had taken thirty-eight matches to reach this mark, compared to Lowe's twenty-four. Before Lowe, other try scorers had had better scoring ratios, amongst them record holders Burton scoring six in six, Wade seven in eight, Tot Robinson eight in eight, and Hudson, nine in eight. Daniel Lambert had also scored eight tries in a career of seven appearances. Lowe's achievement has been singled out as being all the more remarkable due to the almost six year pause in the middle of his career.\nUnderwood's unchallenged record.\nUnderwood went on to score thirty more tries for England over a career spanning twelve years and eighty-five matches, eventually setting a mark of forty-nine tries. He also scored once for the British Lions, bringing his career total of international tries to fifty. Lowe's total of eighteen has been surpassed by a further six players, all playing in an era of many more internationals, and when tries are worth more points relative to other scoring methods and therefore where there is more emphasis on scoring tries. Underwood's mark, however, has never been challenged, the next closest for England being Will Greenwood and Ben Cohen on 31 each."

        "title": "Giant (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A giant is an artistic gymnastics skill in which a gymnast rotates 360 degrees around an axis while in a fully extended position. It is performed on the uneven bars in women's artistic gymnastics and on the parallel bars, horizontal bar, and rings in men's artistic gymnastics.\nTechnique.\nThe gymnast begins in a handstand position. With legs together, toes pointed, and body fully extended, the feet begin to descend. The upper body hollows very slightly until the gymnast passes through horizontal. On the upswing, the abdominal muscles are engaged to slightly arch the body and prevent anterior pelvic tilt, which adversely affects the strength of the swing. The gymnast either returns to the handstand position or continues through handstand to perform another giant or other element.\nThe gymnast must remain in a stretched position for the entire giant, except on parallel bars where the apparatus height necessitates bended knees at the bottom of the swing.\nVariations.\nSome variations on the standard giant include: \nScoring.\nIn the current Federation Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) 2017-2020 Code of Points, a giant is a B (0.2) element on uneven bars for women, and a B (0.2) element on parallel bars and an A (0.1) element on the horizontal bar for men."

        "text": "The Queensland Residents rugby league team is a representative rugby league team consisting of players who compete in the Intrust Super Cup (Queensland Cup) competition. They currently play an annual fixture against NSW Cup Representative Team, often as a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game.\nThe team is administered by the Queensland Rugby League and regularly played its home matches at Suncorp Stadium, until 2015, when they starting playing at Brisbane's Langlands Park (now known as Suzuki Stadium). Up until 1995, the side played against touring international sides and went on tours to countries like New Zealand and France.\nA number of Queensland Residents players have gone onto play for Queensland in State of Origin, including Daly Cherry-Evans and David Taylor. As Residents selection has no bearing on Origin eligibility, a number of players have gone on to also represent New South Wales, including Trent Hodkinson and Jamie Buhrer. New Zealand internationals Jeremy Smith and Adam Blair are also former Queensland Residents representatives.\nHistory.\nThe first Queensland Residents side was selected in 1988 and went on a three-game tour of New Zealand, winning two games. Over the next six years the side toured New Zealand two more times (1990, 1992), Papua New Guinea (1989, 1995), France (1989), Fiji (1992, 1993), Western Samoa (1993), Tonga (1993) and South Africa (1994). In 1990, they defeated the touring French side in Rockhampton and in 1992 lost to the touring Great Britain side in Townsville.\nBetween 1991 and 1993, the Residents played three games against a Sydney Metropolitan Cup rep side, drawing two games and winning one. In 2003 and 2004, they played two games against Western Australia, winning both games. In 2001 and 2002, they were defeated twice by the Queensland Emerging Origin squad.\nSince 1994, the Queensland Residents have played an annual fixture against the New South Wales Residents, currently known as the NSW Cup Representative Team. The fixture was formerly a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game but as of 2015 has been played on the annual Representative Weekend."

All players participating have to be amateurs.\nDuring the 1960s players who left college before the formation of the American Basketball League and\nAmerican Basketball Association had three options: the National Basketball Association, the Eastern League or AAU basketball. And AAU basketball was attractive to many players who wished to remain eligible for the Olympics. Several AAU teams were sponsored by corporations which provided jobs to the players on their teams.\nFamous NBA names played or coached in the AAU Tournaments such as David Robinson, Larry Brown, Gregg Popovich, Bob Kurland, Mike Krzyzewski (as a coach), Jay Triano, Phil Jordon, Roger Brown, George Yardley, Jim Pollard, Clyde Lovellette and Bob Boozer.\nHistory.\nThe tournament started in 1897 and met incredible success until the late 50s. There a few occasion that college players rejected NBA careers opting to play in the AAU. Bill Reigel Reigel who went on to choose the Amateur Athletic Union over an offer from the NBA's Minneapolis Lakers was one of them, managing to earn AAU All-American honors four times. Another great college player who chose AAU over NBA was legendary Bob Kurland.&lt;br&gt;\nThe quality of AAU basketball waned in the 1960s as the expansion of the NBA and the arrival of the ABL followed by the ABA created professional opportunities for the players the AAU teams were seeking. In 1972, the International Basketball Federation withdrew its recognition of the AAU as the institution responsible for organizing U.S. basketball teams. Signaling an end for old AAU basketball, although 1968 was the last year for the annual tournament in Denver."

        "text": "Robert Leroy \"Bob\" Powell (October 17, 1933 – April 26, 2014), identified by his middle name on baseball cards as Leroy Powell, was an American professional baseball player. He threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed .\nThe graduate of Michigan State University signed a $36,000 \"bonus baby\" contract with the Chicago White Sox in . An outfielder when he signed, Powell was kept on the ChiSox' Major League roster for 1955, and part of under the Bonus Rule of the time. He appeared in only two Major League Baseball games as a pinch runner — both times against the Kansas City Athletics. On September 16, 1955, he ran for slow-footed White Sox pinch hitter Ron Northey, who had singled, and was erased on a force play at second base on the first pitch to the next hitter, Minnie Miñoso. On April 20, 1957, he ran for another pinch hitter, Walt Dropo, advanced to second base on a hit by Luis Aparicio and then scored his only MLB run on a single by Nellie Fox. Both Aparicio and Fox are now in the Baseball Hall of Fame.\nAfter seeing Powell throw batting practice for his teammates, 1955–1956 White Sox manager Marty Marion converted him into a pitcher. Powell spent the latter half of the 1956 season serving in the U.S. military, then returned to the White Sox roster for the start of 1957, when he made his final MLB appearance. Chicago was able to send him to the minor leagues later in 1957, but Powell struggled as a pitcher in the Class A Western League — although he batted over .300 in 1957 — and left baseball after the 1958 season."

The school's team currently competes in the ASUN Conference.\nIn 2002, Florida Gulf Coast became an independent member of NCAA Division II. Florida Gulf Coast also started its men's basketball team, with Dave Balza as head coach from the inaugural 2002–03 to the 2010–11 season. He was succeeded by Andy Enfield from 2011–13, who took the Eagles to the Sweet Sixteen as the first ever 15-seed to do such. After putting FGCU on the map with their new \"Dunk City\" moniker, Enfield accepted the men's basketball position at USC. Joe Dooley then assumed the role from 2013-2018 before accepting the Head Coach position at East Carolina Michael Fly served as head coach from 2018 to 2022, before being replaced by former Penn State head coach Pat Chambers. In 2006, Florida Gulf Coast applied for NCAA Division I status and became a transitory Division I effective in the 2007–08 season. Florida Gulf Coast became a full Division I member on August 11, 2011.\nThe Eagles men's basketball team is best known for their run in the 2013 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, their first since moving up to Division I. In the Round of 64, the Eagles defeated the #2 seed Georgetown 78–68. It was only the seventh time that a 15th seed had defeated a 2nd seed, and the second-highest margin of victory for one. Two days later in the Round of 32, the Eagles defeated the #7 seed San Diego State 81–71, becoming the first 15th seed to ever advance to the Sweet 16. The school was referred to as \"Dunk City\" or \"Florida Dunk Coast\" on many media outlets such as ESPN and CBS due to their high-flying athletic finishing style.\nSeason results.\nThe Eagles participated in their first Division I postseason tournament in 2013, qualifying for the NCAA Tournament by winning the ASUN Conference Championship, beating top-seeded Mercer in the conference tournament final. On March 22, 2013, the Eagles, the 15th seed in the South Region, scored one of the biggest upsets in NCAA Tournament history, defeating second-seeded Georgetown 78–68. They were only the seventh #15 seed to defeat a #2 seed, the first being Richmond in its 1991 victory over Syracuse. Two days later, they defeated seventh seeded San Diego State to become the first #15 seed ever to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Their run ended there in a 62–50 loss to third seeded Florida. This is \"officially\" the fourth-deepest run by a first-time tournament participant in NCAA history, behind only Indiana State advancing all the way to the national championship game in 1979 and Charlotte and Georgia reaching the Final Four in 1977 and 1983, respectively. Southwestern Louisiana, now known as Louisiana–Lafayette, advanced to the Sweet 16 in its first appearance as well, in 1972, but that appearance was vacated due to NCAA sanctions. Coach Andy Enfield was hired by USC on April 1. To replace him, the Eagles hired Joe Dooley, an assistant from Kansas.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Eagles have appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament three times.

        "text": "The 2011 European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship was the eighth annual international rugby union competition for Under 18 national rugby union teams in Europe. The event was organised by rugby's European governing body, the FIRA – Association of European Rugby (FIRA-AER). The competition was contested by 28 men's junior national teams and will be held in April 2011. It was hosted by the French region of Armagnac and Bigorre. The tournament was won by the under-18 team of Ireland, who took out the title for the first time, beating England in the final. For the first time, France did not reach the championship game and finished in fourth place only.\nThe tournament's defending champion was France, who had won five European championships and the last four in a row. The 2011 edition of the competition saw the introduction of an elite division, above division one, made up of four teams, France, England, Wales and Ireland. The divisions below remained unchanged. It marked the first time that all countries participating in the Six Nations Championship send a team to the European championship.\nIt was sponsored by French company Justin Bridou and therefore officially called the \"2011 Justin Bridou European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship\".\nOverview.\nHistory.\nThe European Under-18 Rugby Union Championship was first held in 2004, in Treviso, Italy. It replaced the previously held European Under-18 Emergent Nations Championship, which had first been held in 2000. The first championship in 2004 was won by France.\nThe following two championships, held in Lille, France, in 2005 and again in Treviso in 2006, were won by England. Alternating between France and Italy, the next four championships were held in Biarritz, Treviso again, Toulon and once more in Treviso in 2010. All four were won by France, but of Europe's top rugby playing nations, England, Wales and Scotland did not take part in the 2010 edition.\nFormat.\nThe 2011 edition saw the introduction of an Elite division, consisting of four teams, two of which, England and Wales, had not taken part in the 2010 competition or, in the case of Wales, never taken part in the European championship.\nBelow the elite level, the championship was organised in First, Second and Third Divisions, with First being the highest and Third the lowest. Each division consisted of eight teams and each team played three competition games, with a quarter-final, semi-final and final/placing game. The quarter-finals were played according to a seeding list, with the winners moving on to the first to fourth place semi-finals while the losers would enter the fifth to eighth place semi-finals.\nThe winner of the Elite division, Ireland, was crowned European champions while the fourth placed team was to be relegated to the First division. Similarly, the winner of the Second and Third divisions would move up a division for 2012 while the last placed teams would be relegated.\nTo determine the four teams playing in the Elite Division, a qualifying tournament was held between the Six Nations U-18 sides in late February and early March, with the teams drawn into two groups of three teams each. France and England won their groups, with Wales and Ireland finishing second, qualifying all four teams for the Elite Division. Italy and Scotland finished third, placing them in the First Division. For Italy, this was still a bonus as it obtained the second seed for the division, behind Scotland. After an unsuccessful 2010 tournament, where the team had finished only fifth, it would have been entitled to only the fifth seed otherwise. Scotland made a return to the European championship for the first time since 2006.\nVenues.\nThe games of the 2011 championship were played at venues in Armagnac and Bigorre, two regions in southern France. The first round of games in all divisions except the elite one was played on 16 April 2011. The elite division played their first games in Auch the following day. The second round was played on 19 April while the finals for all divisions were held on 22 and 23 April, with Division two and three playing on the 22 and the Elite and First Division on the 23.\nThe venues for the Elite Group where:\nThe venues for the first round were:\nThe venues for the second round were:\nThe venues for the third round were:\nD Division.\nThe D division forms the fourth level, below the Third division, of European Under-18 rugby. In 2011, only three teams compete at this level, at a separate tournament. It consists of the teams of Israel, Croatia and Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina. The tournament was held independently of the other divisions on 14 April at Sinj, Croatia and won by the home nation.\nTeams and standings.\nThe participating teams and their divisions are in order of their ranking after the tournament:\nGames.\nThe scheduled games:\nElite Division.\nThe games of the elite division:\nFirst Division.\nThe games of the first division:\nSecond Division.\nThe games of the second division:\nThird Division.\nThe games of the third division:\nEuropean Championship final.\nThe European Championship final was held on 23 April at 18:30 at Tarbes and was broadcast live on Eurosport 2. The final was played in wet conditions and a well organised Ireland side went up 11-3 by half time. England's head coach, John Fletcher, conceded that it was a well-deserved Irish victory but that the game was an important lesson to learn and would help his players in their future development. For Ireland, which was, for the first time, represented by a schools team rather than a Club XV, captain Luke McGrath was the most influential figure on the field, scoring twelve points."

        "text": "The Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club is a multi-sports and social club located on Campo Alegre in Porto, Portugal. It was founded in 1855 by the British people working in Porto. Initially founded as Oporto Cricket Club, it is the oldest cricket club in mainland Europe. In 1877 they built three tennis courts and the name of the club was changed to its current form. In 1923 the present grounds were acquired.\nIt was one of the very first companies to play football in Portugal, and in 1894, the club disputed the very first football cup played on the Iberian Peninsula, the Taça D. Carlos I, which they lost to a team from Lisbon.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIn the mid 19th century, Porto enjoyed one of the most developed industries in the country, mainly thanks to its wine industry, and for this reason, Porto soon became the home to a British colony, that like in the rest of the world, brought cricket with them, and later football. They began to play cricket matches against each other to pass the time, undergo leisure initiatives, and feel more at home, and inevitably, they founded Oporto Cricket Club in 1855, and it soon become the center of the social life of the Porto British colony. Its grounds were situated south of the River Douro, at Candal in Vila Nova de Gaia, Portugal's second-largest city, and from where the Port wine was exported until 1896. In 1877 they built three tennis courts, and the name of the club was thus changed to \"Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club\".\nThe glory years.\nDuring the first years of cricket in Portugal, there was a healthy rivalry between the Porto club and the ex-pats in Lisbon. The first cricket match against Lisbon took place in the Portuguese capital in 1861 and the first return match in Porto in 1867. Moreover, cricket teams visit from the United Kingdom regularly during the spring and summer.\nIn October 1893, the president of the recently established \"Futebol Clube do Porto\", António Nicolau de Almeida, made an attempt to launch the club with an invitation to Guilherme Pinto Basto, the president of Club Lisbonense, to a football game in Porto, but Pinto Basto declined and instead made the same invitation to Hugh Ponsonby, the then secretary of the Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club, who accepted it because, at the time, they already had a section dedicated to football due to its rapid growth in England, the homeland of the company's workers. The game ended up taking place in March of the following year on the Oporto Cricket field, the Campo Alegre, with the Oporto Cricket equipment, and with Hugh Ponsonby as team captain. Of the eleven starters who played for Oporto Cricket that day, only two were Portuguese, Francisco Guimarães and Adolfo Ramos, with the latter being the only one who was not a member of Oporto Cricket. The game ended in a 0–1 loss and it was sponsored by the King Carlos I of Portugal, which was pivotal to attract a significant number of spectators, as football was practically an unknown sport in Portugal at the time.\nRecent years.\nThroughout the 20th century, the entity developed into a club with several sports at hand. In addition to cricket, tennis, and football, the Oporto club also hosts other modalities such as squash, billiards, snooker, with pool being opened in the summer months between April and September."

His nickname was The Game.\nCareer.\nDouglas won the 1995 WDF Europe Youth Cup, and made his BDO World Darts Championship debut in 2000. He defeated Gary Spedding in the first round before losing to eventual champion Ted Hankey in the second round.\nDouglas returned to the BDO World Championship stage in 2011, losing 0-3 in the first round to Gary Robson. He has also appeared in the Last 16 of the World Masters in 2009 and again in 2011.\nDouglas qualified for the World Championship again in 2012, and again was drawn against Robson in the first round. On this occasion, Douglas defeated Robson 3-0. He was defeated in the second round by Paul Jennings.\nHe was the main administrator of the BDO's Players Forum, along with John Leatherbarrow and Lucy Evenden.\nDouglas entered PDC Q School in January 2014, but only entered three of the four days and failed to win enough games to acquire a tour card. However, by participating he gained PDPA membership which gave him entry into certain events. In May, he beat two-time world champion Adrian Lewis on his way to the last 16 of a PDC event for the first time at the 10th Players Championship of the year, where he lost 6–1 to Tony Newell. He was defeated in two Challenge Tour finals during the year to Mark Frost 5–1 and Matt Clark 5–4 (after having been 4–2 ahead). This helped Douglas to finish eighth on the Challenge Tour Order of Merit. \nIn 2015 he participated in the Qualifying School to renew his tour card due to him being ranked outside the top 64. Douglas earned a two-year tour card on day three of four with a 5–4 victory over Jermaine Wattimena. At the UK Open he enjoyed wins over Mark Robinson, John Bowles and Andy Boulton to reach the third round where John Henderson ended his run with a 9–7 victory. A sole last 32 exit was his best result during the rest of the year.\nPersonal life.\nDouglas suffered a heart attack on 13 December 2012 and required a stent to be fitted after a blood clot was found in his coronary artery. He defecates 4 times a day."

Prior to 2015, when president Scott Coker made the decision to drop the 8-man tournament format, Bellator fighters participated in a series of tournament bouts in a set weight class over a season (usually between 10 and 13 events over 3 or 4 months).

        "title": "Archie Miller (basketball)",
        "text": "Ryan Joseph \"Archie\" Miller (born October 30, 1978) is an American men's college basketball coach for the Rhode Island Rams.\nMiller played point guard for North Carolina State from 1998 to 2002 and ended his career among the school's leaders in free-throw percentage, three-point field goal percentage, and total three-pointers. From 2011 to 2017, he was the head coach for the University of Dayton and won the conference regular season championship in 2016 and 2017, when he was named the Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year. He left Dayton to be the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers in 2017, but was relieved of his duties after only four seasons following the conclusion of the 2020–2021 season. After not coaching a team during the 2021–22 NCAA Division I men's basketball season, he was named the head coach of the Rhode Island Rams men's basketball team on March 18, 2022.\nEarly years and playing career.\nMiller was born and raised in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, just northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His given name is \"Ryan\" but garnered the nickname \"Archie\" at an early age due to his personality being similar to that of Archie Bunker, the grouchy TV character from \"All in the Family\".\nMiller grew up in a basketball family. Both he and his older brother Sean Miller played for their father, John Miller, a former coach at Blackhawk High School, who went 657–280 in a 35-year coaching career, including 104–29 in the postseason, before retiring in 2005. He won eight Western Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic League championships, the second most in history, and four Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association titles. Miller noted how much he learned from his father, saying, \"He's really teaching you how to be a coach, and you don't even realize it. He knew what hard work was. He knew what dedication was. He knew what preparation was. He knew how to communicate. It starts to come naturally to you. It's all you do. It's all you're around, and it's all you talk about.”\nIn addition to his father's connection to the game, Miller's brother, Sean, was a point guard who went on to play the position at Pitt. Archie views Sean, who is 10 years older, as more of a mentor than a rival. Sean, then an assistant at North Carolina State University, recruited Archie to play as a point guard. Sean later also hired Archie as an assistant at Arizona when he got the job in 2009. “We didn’t grow up in the house together two years apart and the backyard,” Archie said. “... I basically look at him sort of as the role model, the guy whom to be like, the guy who to call when you need something, the one that helped you get to where you wanted to get to.\" Miller's sister, Lisa, also played Division I basketball at Toledo and Elon.\nFollowing high school, Miller played point guard for North Carolina State from 1998 to 2002. As a senior, he helped lead the Wolfpack to the championship game of the ACC Tournament, and was named to the all-tournament team. He finished his career there with an 84.6% free-throw percentage, a 42.9 three-point field goal percentage, and 218 three-pointers, which were all marks that ranked in the top 10 in school history. He graduated from NC State in 2002 with his bachelor's degree in Parks, Recreation and Tourism.\nCoaching career.\nAssistant coaching positions (2003–2011).\nMiller spent time at several programs as an assistant coach, spending a season at Western Kentucky (2003–04), two at NC State (2004–2006), one at Arizona State (2006–07) under former coach Herb Sendek, two at Ohio State (2007–09) under Thad Matta, and two at Arizona (2009–11) under his brother Sean. While at Arizona, Miller shined as a top recruiter, helping secure Arizona's top 10 recruiting class for 2011 recruits. He also excelled as a game strategist and designed the Wildcats' upset of eighth-ranked Texas to get them to the Sweet 16.\nUniversity of Dayton (2011–2017).\nMiller became the head coach of the Dayton Flyers men's basketball team in 2011 and turned around a program that had back-to-back disappointing seasons. His first season with Dayton saw Miller take the school to 20 wins. In his third year, 2014, he had the Flyers in the Elite Eight with 26 wins; to get there, Dayton upset three higher seeded teams. After the Elite Eight run in 2014, Miller faced replacing three starters and four seniors from that team. Despite having a depleted roster featuring just six players who were recruited to Dayton and no active player taller than 6-foot-6, Miller led his Flyers to a 27–9 overall record and to the third round of the 2015 NCAA tournament.\nIn the following three seasons, Miller averaged over 25 wins and each year coached the team made to the NCAA tournament. The latter two the Flyers also earned regular season Atlantic 10 champion titles. The Flyers' 78 wins in from 2013–16 matched the best three-year period in school history. Due to his coaching abilities, Miller was named a finalist for the 2015 Jim Phelan National Coach of the Year Award. In April, 2015, he joined his father and brother in the Beaver County Sports Hall of Fame.\nIndiana University (2017–2021).\nOn March 27, 2017, Miller was named the 29th head coach in the history of the Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team. Miller's first season involved rebuilding the program and laying the foundation of a pack-line defense and valuing possessions. Early in the season, Miller stated practices were 75% defense and 25% offense. With an early second round loss in the 2018 Big Ten tournament and no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or NIT, Indiana's first season under their new coach came to a disappointing close with an overall record of 16–15 and 9–9 in the Big Ten. Nevertheless, Miller got off to an impressive recruiting start, including the commitment of five star recruit Romeo Langford, a McDonald's-All American, 2018 Indiana Mr. Basketball, and (according to ESPN) the six ranked player in the nation.\nDespite getting off to a strong start of 12–2, including three conference wins, the 2018–19 Hoosiers struggled down the backstretch of the season. Riddled with injuries and poor shooting, Indiana lost 12 of 13 games before turning things around and finishing the regular season with a four-game winning streak. Indiana failed to receive a bid to the NCAA tournament but earned a 1-seed in the NIT, where they lost in the quarterfinals, ending the season with an overall record of 19–16 and 8–12 in the Big Ten.\nFor the 2019–20 season, the Hoosiers started off 11–1 before ending their season with an overall record of 20–12 record including a conference record of 9–11. They won their first game of the Big Ten tournament before it was announced that the rest of the tournament was to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The NCAA tournament was later cancelled; the Hoosiers were expected to make the tournament for the first time in Miller's tenure.\nThe 2020–21 season proved to be the most disappointing of Miller's tenure with the Hoosiers ending the season on a six-game losing streak, including a first round loss in the Big Ten tournament against Rutgers. Indiana finished the season with a 12–15 record and a 7–12 Big Ten record. The Hoosiers lost to Purdue twice during the season, making Miller's record against Purdue 0–7. The Hoosiers failed to receive a bid to the 2021 NCAA Tournament. On March 15, 2021, Miller was fired by Indiana. He finished his four seasons at Indiana with a 67–56 record, a 33–43 Big Ten record, and no NCAA tournament appearances.\nRhode Island.\nOn March 18, 2022, Miller reached a deal to be the new head coach at Rhode Island.\nCoaching philosophy.\nMiller employs a structured transition offense intended to open up games, create foul trouble for opponents, and score before the defense can get set. His offensive approach has been called \"one of the most complete transition offensive systems you will find.\" He frequently uses a \"Phoenix fast break\" with players pushing the ball off of rebounds and turnovers in a flexible system that can take on a variety of alignments. He will modify the Phoenix break based on personnel to accommodate five guards or two post players on the floor at once. If an opponent scores, Miller employs a \"Carolina transition offense\" to create scoring opportunities which flow right into a motion offense.\nThe identity of Miller's teams are rooted in defense. He employs a \"pack line defense\", which is a variation of man-to-man defense invented by Dick Bennett at Wisconsin and also employed by Tony Bennett at Virginia and Tom Izzo at Michigan State, among others. Instead of the off-ball defenders pressuring their player and denying the pass, everyone except the player guarding the ball must be inside an imaginary line 16 feet from the rim. At all times a defender pressures the player with the basketball, while the other four defenders play in gap/help positions. However, if the offensive player picks up the dribble, all players go out and deny looking for the steal. The pack line defense is intended to discourage penetration, getting inside the paint, and forces opponents to win with a well executed offense and good outside shooting.\nPersonal life.\nWhile attending NC State, Miller met Morgan Cruse, who was also a student and athlete for the Wolfpack. Morgan was on the NC State track and field team. The couple dated during college and married in 2003. In 2004, they had a daughter, Leah. His brother Sean Miller is the head basketball coach at Xavier University."

        "text": "The Cricket World Cup is an international cricket competition established in 1975. It is contested by the men's national teams of the members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the sport's global governing body. The tournament generally takes place every four years. Most recently, the 2023 Cricket World Cup, hosted by India, was won by Australia, who beat India. The current trophy was instituted in 1999. It always remains with the ICC, and a replica is awarded to the winning team.\nFor the 2019 and 2023 World Cups, the host nation and the seven other highest-ranked nations automatically qualify for the World Cup, while other nations including associate and affiliate ICC members play in a qualification tournament, the World Cup Qualifier. Though an associate member is yet to reach the final, Kenya did reach the semi-finals in 2003. Australia is the most successful team in the competition's history, winning six tournaments and finishing as runner-up twice. Twice, teams have won successive tournaments: the West Indies won the first two editions (1975 and 1979) and Australia won three in a row (1999, 2003, and 2007). Australia has played in the most finals (eight out of thirteen: 1975, 1987, 1996, 1999, 2003, 2007, 2015, and 2023). England has lost the most World Cup finals, ending as runner-up in all three final appearances before their victory in the 2019 tournament.\nOf the twenty teams that have qualified for at least one Cricket World Cup, seven have contested a tournament final. Seven venues have hosted the final; only two of those – Lord's, in London, and the Melbourne Cricket Ground – have hosted multiple finals. India is the only country that has hosted a World Cup final at more than one venue, with Eden Gardens, Kolkata, hosting in 1987, Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium hosting in 2011 and Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad hosting in 2023.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural ICC Cricket World Cup final was held on 21 June 1975 at Lord's, contested by Australia and the West Indies. A man of the match performance, including a century, from West Indian captain Clive Lloyd, coming in to bat at number five with his team at 50/3, formed the basis of a 149-run fourth-wicket partnership with Rohan Kanhai. Keith Boyce added a quick 34 and the Australians were set a target of 292 to win in 60 overs. In reply, Alan Turner hit 40 from 54 deliveries and Australian captain Ian Chappell scored 62 from 93 balls. Australia \"contributed to their own destruction\" in an innings with five run outs, and the West Indies were crowned the first cricket world champions, winning by 17 runs.\nFour years later, the West Indies qualified for the final, this time facing England, hosted at Lord's for the second consecutive tournament. An unbeaten 138 from Viv Richards, and support from Collis King in a 139-run partnership for the fifth wicket, saw the West Indies set England a target of 287 runs to win in 60 overs. A profitable but slow opening partnership between Mike Brearley and Geoffrey Boycott (the latter taking 17 overs to reach double figures) saw England to 129. However, following Brearley's dismissal, only Graham Gooch and Derek Randall made a \"brief assault\" on the West Indian bowling, before a batting collapse, Joel Garner taking five wickets in eleven balls. England ended 194 all out, and presented the West Indies with their second consecutive title, winning by 92 runs.\nLord's hosted the third World Cup final in June 1983; this was West Indies' third consecutive final. This time they faced India in front of 24,609 spectators. Sunil Gavaskar was dismissed early in the innings for two runs, and only Kris Srikkanth scored more than thirty; Andy Roberts took three wickets for the West Indies, leaving India all out for 183. After the dismissals of Viv Richards, Desmond Haynes and Larry Gomes by Madan Lal for six runs between them, the West Indies collapsed to 140 all out, handing the title to India by 43 runs. India and Pakistan co-hosted the 1987 tournament; the final was held at Eden Gardens in Kolkata between Australia and England, both appearing for the second time and vying for their first title. Australia won the toss and elected to bat first; David Boon scored 75 runs from 125 deliveries, while Mike Veletta made a rapid 45 from 31 deliveries, taking Australia to a total of 253/5 by the close of play, this time after 50 overs. In front of around 70,000 spectators, England's middle order of Bill Athey, Mike Gatting and Allan Lamb provided some resistance, but with 17 runs required in the final over to win, England fell short and lost by 7 runs.\nThe 1992 tournament was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand, with the first ever day/night final being held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in Australia between England and Pakistan. In their first final appearance, Pakistan won the toss and elected to bat first. Despite two early wickets from Derek Pringle, Pakistani batsmen Imran Khan and Javed Miandad shared a third-wicket partnership of 139. Both Inzamam-ul-Haq and Wasim Akram added over thirty runs each at more than a run-a-ball, leading Pakistan to a total of 249/6 in 50 overs. A crowd of over 87,000 saw man-of-the-match Wasim Akram take three of England's wickets, including that of all-rounder Ian Botham for a duck, after Graeme Hick was \"baffled by the googly\". England were bowled out for 227, and Pakistan won by 22 runs.\nIndia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka hosted the tournament in 1996. It was Sri Lanka's first appearance in the final, and they faced 1987 champions Australia in another day/night contest. After winning the toss, Arjuna Ranatunga sent Australia in to bat at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Captain Mark Taylor and Ricky Ponting added 101 in their second-wicket partnership as Australia completed their 50 overs with 241/7. Man of the match Aravinda de Silva's century, assisted by partnerships with Asanka Gurusinha and Ranatunga, led Sri Lanka to the target with 22 balls and 7 wickets to spare, and their first win in the final. This was the first time a host won the title, though the final was played in Pakistan. It was also the first time that the team batting second emerged victorious.\nAustralia's \"12-year era of World Cup dominance\" began with the 1999 tournament, hosted for the fourth time by England. In a \"one-sided\" final at Lord's, Shane Warne's four wickets helped to restrict Pakistan to 132 runs, all out with 11 overs yet to bat. A rapid fifty from Adam Gilchrist, and support from Mark Waugh, Ponting and Darren Lehmann, saw Australia reach the total in just over 20 overs, winning by eight wickets.\nThe 2003 tournament had three co-hosts: South Africa, Kenya and Zimbabwe, the final being a day/night match contested between Australia and India at the Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg. Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden opened the batting, making a century partnership, before Ponting and Damien Martin went on to score the highest partnership in any World Cup final with an unbeaten 234. Australia batted out their fifty overs, and ended on the highest score in World Cup final history: 359/2. Player of the tournament Sachin Tendulkar was dismissed in the first over of India's reply but Virender Sehwag and Rahul Dravid combined to score 88 in their fourth wicket partnership. However, following Dravid's dismissal, India's batting collapsed, and they finished on 234 all out with nearly eleven overs remaining, handing Australia a 125-run victory.\nThe 2007 final, held at the Kensington Oval in Barbados, was reduced to 38 overs a side following a two-hour rain delay. Australia's Gilchrist hit the fastest century in a World Cup final at a strike rate of over 143 and his opening stand with Hayden became the largest first-wicket partnership in World Cup history. Australia ended on 281/4, an average of 7.39 runs per over. In reply, Sanath Jayasuriya and Kumar Sangakkara accumulated 116 runs for the second wicket, but with Chamara Silva the only other batsman to score over 20, Sri Lanka capitulated. Despite a revised target, due to a further rain break, calculated using the Duckworth–Lewis method, Sri Lanka scored 215–8 from their allotted overs. With a 53-run victory, Australia won their third consecutive World Cup. \nBangladesh, India and Sri Lanka co-hosted the 2011 tournament, with the latter pair meeting in the final in the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Scoring 91 runs in their final 10 overs, Sri Lanka's innings ended on 274/6, Mahela Jayawardene top-scoring with an unbeaten 103. Sehwag was out leg before wicket to Lasith Malinga in the second ball of the Indian innings; Tendulkar soon followed him, but 97 from Gautam Gambhir and an unbeaten 91 from MS Dhoni saw India home with 10 balls to spare. By winning the match, India became the first team to win the finals on home soil.\nThe 2015 final, held at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, was won by hosts Australia. Their fast bowlers ripped through the New Zealand team, with Mitchell Starc bowling Brendon McCullum out for a duck and Mitchell Johnson taking three wickets. Despite the efforts of Grant Elliot, New Zealand were bowled out for 183. Steven Smith and Michael Clarke registered half-centuries as Australia won their fifth World Cup.\nFour years later, the 2019 final, held at Lord's, was won by hosts England. England, playing in their first final in 27 years, defeated New Zealand to take the trophy. The Final was decided on a countback of boundaries scored in the match after both teams finished tied after normal play and again in a one over 'Super Over' designed to separate the teams.\nThis method of separating the Finalists was changed by the ICC after the match in favour of continuing with Super Overs until the teams can be separated.\nThe 2023 final, held at Narendra Modi Stadium, Australia won the match by 6 wickets with 42 balls left. Australia won the toss and chose to bowl first. India scored 240 runs in 50 overs and Australia scored 241 runs with 4 wickets.\nICC World Cup.\n\"Note: the World Cups hosted by England (1983, 1999, 2019) and South Africa (2003) also had some matches played in Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Netherlands, Zimbabwe and Kenya\""

        "text": "Robert Lee Harrison (September 22, 1930 – January 11, 2023) was an American professional baseball player, a right-handed pitcher who had two one-game end-of-season trials in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles in and . He batted left-handed, stood tall and weighed . He was born in St. Louis, Missouri.\nIn 1955, after a 14–12 win–loss record in the Class A Western League, Harrison was called to Baltimore when the rosters expanded in September. He relieved starting pitcher Eddie Lopat in the fifth inning of the second game of a twinight doubleheader on September 23 at Griffith Stadium against the Washington Senators. Harrison hurled two innings and surrendered four bases on balls, two hits and two earned runs in a 7–3 Oriole defeat.\nThe following season, Harrison won 10 games and lost 12 in a year split between the Double-A Texas League and the Open-Classification Pacific Coast League. Recalled by the Orioles again, he started on September 26, 1956, at Memorial Stadium against the eventual world champion New York Yankees. He lasted only 1⅔ innings, giving up three earned runs, three hits and five walks. However, Harrison was not charged with the 11–6 Baltimore defeat, as Hal Brown, who relieved him in the second inning, gave up the winning run. Altogether Harrison appeared in two MLB games, pitched in 3⅔ innings, and gave up five earned runs, six hits, and five bases on balls. He did not record a strikeout. His eight-year pro career concluded after the 1958 season.\nHarrison died in Fishers, Indiana on January 11, 2023, at the age of 92."

        "text": "The 2nd semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup 2011 was played between the Indian cricket team and the Pakistani cricket team at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali on 30March 2011. India won the toss and elected to bat, scoring 260 runs in their allotted 50 overs while losing 9 wickets. Pakistan, after starting well, fell short; they were all out for 231 runs in 49.5 overs. Thus, India won the match by 29 runs and qualified for the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final, while eliminating Pakistan from the tournament. India subsequently beat Sri Lanka in the final, winning the 2011 Cricket World Cup.\nRivalry background.\nIndia and Pakistan have been rivals in various fields since the Partition of India in 1947. Since then the countries have fought three wars against each other. Since the first international cricket match between the two countries in 1952, political or diplomatic tensions frequently influenced their cricket relations, including the suspension of cricket tours. Once it became clear that the two teams would play each other in the 2nd semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 a great deal of hype was generated; the match was even equated to war.\nMatch.\nThe match was played on 30March 2011 at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali in India. There were fears that rain would curtail or postpone the match until the Meteorological Department issued assurances that the period of the match would be rain-free. The Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni won the toss and elected to bat first. India made 260 runs in their 50 overs, losing 9 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar top scored with 85 runs and was declared the man of the match. Pakistan on the other hand, though getting off to a good start failed to maintain consistency and were restricted to just 231 runs while being bowled out in 49.5 overs. India won the match and confirmed their place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final.\nFall of wickets: 1-48 (Virender Sehwag, 5.5 ov), 2-116 (Gautam Gambhir, 18.5 ov), 3-141 (Virat Kohli, 25.2 ov), 4-141 (Yuvraj Singh, 25.3 ov), 5-187 (Sachin Tendulkar, 36.6 ov), 6-205 (MS Dhoni, 41.4 ov), 7-236 (Harbhajan Singh, 46.4 ov), 8-256 (Zaheer Khan, 49.2 ov), 9–258 (Ashish Nehra, 49.5 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1-44 (Kamran Akmal, 8.6 ov), 2-70 (Mohammad Hafeez, 15.3 ov), 3-103 (Asad Shafiq, 23.5 ov), 4-106 (Younis Khan, 25.4 ov), 5-142 (Umar Akmal, 33.1 ov), 6-150 (Abdul Razzaq, 36.2 ov), 7-184 (Shahid Afridi, 41.5 ov), 8-199 (Wahab Riaz, 44.5 ov), 9-208 (Umar Gul, 46.1 ov), 10-231 (Misbah-ul-Haq, 49.5 ov)\nBuildup and aftermath.\nThe match was played in front of a huge crowd. This included Victory Venkatesh, Aamir Khan, Priety Zinta, Vivek Oberoi and many other celebrities and diplomats from both nations. Cricket diplomacy was used to strengthen the relationships between the two nations after the deterioration caused by the 2008 Mumbai attacks: Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh invited his Pakistani counterpart, Yousuf Raza Gilani, to watch the match with him at Mohali; Gilani accepted.\nAfter the victory, revelry erupted throughout India and fans across the country celebrated through the night. In Pakistan, the loss was met with violence and agitation by several fans. In Pakistan it was reported that three people, including a Pakistani actor, died of shock after Pakistan lost the match. The match drew high television ratings – in India it had an estimated 11.74% TV rating for the whole match, although its audience was beaten by the India v Sri Lanka final with 135 million viewers."

        "text": "The International Radio Sailing Association (IRSA) formerly the ISAF Radio Sailing Division is an affiliate member of World Sailing that sanctions radio-controlled sailing competitions. It is authorised by WS to conduct up to three official World Championships each year.\nClasses.\nFour classes of radio sailing boat are designated as IRSA classes, as follows from the smallest to largest:\nThe IOM class rules specify a monohull of maximum length 1000 mm, with maximum draught 420 mm. There is a minimum weight of 4000 g, which makes homebuilding of competitive boats possible. The IOM has three one-design rigs. To keep costs down, hull materials are restricted to either wood or glassfiber, while masts and booms are restricted to either aluminium or wood.\nA Marblehead has a maximum length of 1290 mm and a maximum draught of ca 700 mm, but no minimum displacement. Up to six rigs are allowed. \nHistory.\nAt the I.M.Y.R.U. General Meeting at Dunkerque in 1982, it was resolved to adopt the IYRR and IYRU Measurement Instructions and to follow the IYRU Constitution and Regulations as closely as possible. For the next eight years a lot of very hard work was done by the I.M.Y.R.U., particularly by its then chairman, Norman Hatfield, to get Model Yachting accepted into membership of the full-size governing body, the International Yacht Racing Union (IYRU). This work culminated on 1 May 1990 when the I.M.Y.R.U. became the Model Yacht Racing Division of the IYRU (IYRU - MYRD). In its turn, in August 1996, the IYRU changed its name to the International Sailing Federation (ISAF) and IYRU-MYRD became the ISAF Radio Sailing Division (RSD). In 2009 the Division changed its name to International Radio Sailing Association to make it clear that it was an independent body and not a part of ISAF, now World Sailing. The two organisations have close links with World Sailing officially recognising its World Championships and using the IRSA to advise on developments of Appendix E of the Racing Rules of Sailing."

        "text": "Dart golf games are games in which darts are thrown at traditional dart boards or dart boards that resemble golf courses with colored areas that represent a golf course. Dart golf games use golf-like rules and scoring. Rules and board configurations of the game vary from league to league, but are generally played single, head-to-head or with teams.\nHistory.\nDart golf games have been known since as early as 1932 based on Harrison Johnston UK Patent submission. Later, NODOR produced an 18-hole golf dartboard and another dartboard called PAR DARTS. Further, there was a patent filed in 1997 by Howard Hanson for a dartboard where the numbers are in a different order than the standard dartboard to make playing golf on the board more like playing a golf course. Finally, Dolf was developed on September 1, 1999 in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada by Keith Meyer and Michael Meyer where a golf like game is played on a standard dart board. Dolf is regulated by the World Dolf Federation (WDFF) with representation in Canada and Pakistan.\nDarts and dartboards.\nThe dartboards used to play dart golf games consist of 3 major categories. First are dartboards that are representations of golf courses. Second are dartboards that are very similar to traditional dartboards but are arranged differently in order to make playing golf on the board more representative of playing golf. The final category is playing dart golf games on traditional dartboards.\nThe rules of the dart golf games vary. Typically for the dartboards that are representation of golf courses, the player's score is determined by where in the area defining the hole the dart lands. In general, if the player lands closer to the hole they will have a better score. For dart golf games that are played on either traditional dartboards or dartboards that are derivatives of traditional dartboards, the scoring is derived from landing the darts in the number related to the hole the player is on, the double, the treble, the 25 and the bull's eye such as Halex's Golf, A1Darts' Golf, Dolf and Apex Golf."

        "text": "Michael Emerson White (born March 2, 1977) is an American college basketball coach and former player. He is the head coach of the University of Georgia men's basketball team. Prior to accepting the job at Georgia, White was the head coach of the Florida Gators from 2015 to 2022 and the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs from 2011 to 2015.\nPlaying career.\nWhite played at Ole Miss from 1995 to 1999. In 1995, White began his four-year collegiate career as a freshman guard for the Ole Miss Rebels men's basketball team. He became a starter in the eighth game of his freshman year and remained a starter for the remainder of his four years at Ole Miss. During White's college career, he had 370 assists, the 6th highest total in Ole Miss history. He also led his team to two SEC Western Division Titles, three consecutive NCAA men's basketball tournaments (1997, 1998 and 1999), and the first NCAA Tournament victory in the history of Ole Miss. He played professional basketball with the IBL's New Mexico Slam and internationally in England.\nCoaching career.\nJacksonville State.\nAfter earning his bachelor's degree at Ole Miss, White joined the men's basketball coaching staff at Jacksonville State in 2000. White stayed at the university for four seasons where he was an assistant coach from 2000 to 2003 and the associate head coach from 2003 to 2004. During his time at Jacksonville State, he helped coordinate the team's recruiting activities. These efforts paid off as the men's basketball team achieved its greatest success since moving up to the Division I ranks, and five Jacksonville State recruits were named all-conference players during White's four-year stint. In 2002, Jacksonville State recorded its first conference tournament victory since moving up to Division I. The following year, Jacksonville State went 20–10 for the year marking the winningest season in the school's Division I history.\nOle Miss.\nWhite spent seven seasons (2005–2011) on the Ole Miss coaching staff and developed a reputation as one of the top assistant coaches in the country.\nA finalist for the 2009 Coaches Award presented by BasketballScoop.com - honoring the top assistants in the college game - White was instrumental in the Rebels' rise to prominence in the Southeastern Conference as he helped lead the program to four postseason berths and a pair of SEC West titles in the past five years. The Rebels won 20 or more games four of the last five seasons.\nWhite was very well known in the recruiting circles nationwide, especially in the Southern region of the country.

Pyeongchang was one of seven applicants for the games, and one of three to be short-listed, along with Sochi, Russia, and Salzburg, Austria.\nThe bid was the second consecutive time Pyeongchang bid for the Olympics, following its close-call 2010 bid. The 2014 project concentrated all venues within one hour of Pyeongchang, called for huge sums of investment into new infrastructure and sporting venues, including the new Alpensia Resort; moreover, the sporting event would promote a message of peace and harmony in the divided nation. Since 2003, the region was selected to host the 2009 Mount Titlis World Women's Curling Championship and the FIS Snowboarding World Championships 2009 in Gangwon, the 2009 Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, in an aim at becoming the winter sports hub of Asia. Although an International Olympic Committee evaluation team complimented the area on levels of public support, government support, and infrastructure in February 2007, Pyeongchang is not a popular tourist destination for foreign skiers, snow machines are heavily relied on due to South Korea's dry winter climate, most slopes in the area's two ski resorts are relatively short, amenities and entertainment facilities in the surrounding area are relatively undeveloped, and \"the runs are blocked off in a way that it is tough to find a place to take a mid-slope pee in the woods,\" causing some to question Pyeongchang's ability to successfully host the Winter Olympics."

It is home to the University of South Florida Bulls baseball team of the Division I American Athletic Conference. The facility has a capacity of 3,211 spectators. Opening in 2011, it replaced Red McEwen Field as the home of USF's baseball team.\nFeatures of the ballpark include a 1,500-seat grandstand with canopy, a berm which can accommodate over 1,700 additional spectators along each foul line and in left field, in-ground dugouts, fan pavilions, press box, batting cages, a large Daktronics scoreboard, party pavilions in left and right field, and the Donaldson Deck, a party deck where fans can view both the baseball field and adjacent USF Softball Stadium field at the same time.\nHistory.\nAfter the demolition of Red McEwen Field following the 2010 season, construction of a new facility on the same location began. The alignment of the new field was changed, with home plate moving from the northwest corner to the southwest corner, to accommodate a concourse shared with the newly constructed neighboring USF Softball Stadium and create the USF Baseball/Softball Complex. The physical field is still named after McEwen, as can be seen on the backstop behind home plate, but the stadium is called USF Baseball Stadium.\nLike its predecessor, the field is named after James \"Red\" McEwen, a local civic leader who helped to establish the university as well as an early booster of the university's athletic programs. He was also the brother of iconic longtime \"Tampa Tribune\" sportswriter Tom McEwen. A plaque honoring McEwen sits near the stadium's main entrance.\nThe new baseball/softball complex was designed by Populous. Construction began shortly after the end of the 2010 season, with the stadium hosting its first game on February 25, 2011. The first game at the ballpark set a new attendance record for USF baseball with 3,126 fans (the old field had a capacity of 2,500). Later that season, the Bulls set a new program attendance record again with a sellout crowd of 3,211 fans in a loss to No. 1 Florida.\nIn 2011, the first year of the stadium's opening, the Bulls ranked 29th in Division I college baseball in attendance. The team regularly finishes in the top 30 in the nation for annual attendance.\nIn 2012, college baseball writer Eric Sorenson ranked the stadium as the fifth most underrated venue in Division I baseball.\nDuring a game against Army on March 16, 2017, Bulls pitchers Shane McClanahan and Carson Ragsdale combined to throw the first (and only as of the end of the 2022 season) no-hitter in the stadium's history.\nAs of the end of the 2021 season, the Bulls have a 239–128–1 record at the stadium\nExternal links.\nTeam website"

Along with Oslo and Tromsø bid, it was one of three options for the Norwegian Olympic Committee, who ultimately chose to not bid for the games.\nPlans.\nMost of the events would take place in Trondheim and its suburbs. Nordic skiing and biathlon would have taken place at Granåsen, which previously has hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 1997. Five competition ice rinks would be built: two at Leangen, for short-track speed skating and figure skating and ice hockey, Tiller for ice hockey, Stjørdal for curling, and Brattøra for speed skating. The latter would be built nearly a sea level, and would have spectators on one end and a glass wall on the other, giving a view of the Trondheimsfjord. Freestyle and snowboarding would be located at Vassfjellet. Alpine skiing and sliding sports would be located at Oppdal. With the exception of Brattøra, all venues would have been built in connection with existing venues.\nThe opening and closing ceremonies would have taken place at Lerkendal stadion, the home ground of Rosenborg BK. A media center was planned at Lerkendal, which would afterwards be converted to student housing. The Olympic Village would be located at Tempe and would afterwards be sold as housing. A separate Olympic Village would be built in Oppdal. Medal ceremonies would take place at Torvet in the city center of Trondheim, and Torget in Oppdal. For volunteers, 30,000 beds exist, and another 30,000 beds are available within two hours of Trondheim.\nAs long as existing plans for transport in the region were followed, only minor upgrades to Trondheim Airport, Værnes would be needed. The upgrades would allow the transport time along the Trondheim and Oppdal in 75 minutes. Marvin Wiseth, who was managing director of the project group, stated that Trondheim's goal was to \"give the Olympics back to the people\". They estimated 2 million spectators at the events. In Norway, regional policy was an important factor in deciding where the applicant city should be; Wiseth stated that with was completely unimportant for IOC, and that Trondheim first and foremost focused on having the best bid in the world, rather than the best bid in Norway.\nEvaluation and outcome.\nThe Trondheim bid was one of three submitted to the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports (NIF), along with Oslo and Tromsø. The three bids were evaluated by a committee led by Odd Martinsen, which concluded that Trondheim was the second-most suitable, behind Oslo, based on the same criteria that IOC uses to evaluate bids. The decision for a Norwegian applicant was taken by the NIF board on 30 March 2007. In the first round of voting, only Geir Kvillum voted for Trondheim. In the following round, both Oslo and Tromsø received six votes, and President Odd-Roar Thorsen received the decisive vote."

        "title": "Reggie Jackson (basketball, born 1990)",
        "text": "Reginald Shon Jackson (born April 16, 1990), nicknamed Big Government, is an American professional basketball player for the Denver Nuggets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played three seasons for the Boston College Eagles before declaring for the 2011 NBA draft, where he was drafted 24th overall by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Jackson also played for the Detroit Pistons and Los Angeles Clippers before joining the Nuggets, where he won a championship with the team in 2023.\nEarly life.\nJackson was born in Pordenone, in northeast Italy, to American parents. Jackson's father served at Aviano Air Base. The Jacksons later moved to England before going to the United States when Jackson was five. The family lived in North Dakota for a year before moving to Georgia and Florida before settling in Colorado Springs, Colorado when Jackson was in sixth grade. He graduated from General William J. Palmer High School in Colorado Springs in 2008, and won the 2007–08 Gatorade Colorado Boys' Basketball Player of the Year. In April 2008, Jackson officially declared as an American citizen and relinquished his Italian citizenship.\nConsidered a three-star recruit by Rivals.com, Jackson was listed as the No. 29 shooting guard and the No. 115 player in the nation in 2008.\nCollege career.\nJackson arrived at Boston College and joined a team that was already armed with stars such as Tyrese Rice and Rakim Sanders. In Jackson's freshman season, the Eagles made the NCAA tournament with Jackson being used as an explosive weapon off the bench. In his second season, Jackson stepped into a starting role following the departure of Rice, but the Eagles were unable to make it back to the NCAA Tournament. As a junior in 2010–11, he led the Eagles in scoring with 18.2 points per game and led them to the National Invitation Tournament. He subsequently earned first-team All-ACC honors alongside Nolan Smith, Jordan Williams, Malcolm Delaney and Kyle Singler. After his junior season, Jackson declared for the NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nOklahoma City Thunder (2011–2015).\nJackson was drafted with the 24th overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft by the Oklahoma City Thunder. Jackson saw limited action in his first season with the Thunder, averaging just 11.1 minutes over 45 games playing behind Russell Westbrook and Eric Maynor. He scored over three points per game but shot only 32% from the field, and that percentage dropped to 21% when Jackson took shots beyond the arc. He did not play in any of the Thunder's 20 playoff games in 2012 as the Thunder lost to the Miami Heat 4 games to 1 in the NBA Finals.\nJackson was assigned multiple times to the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Development League between March and December 2012.\nAs a sophomore during the 2012–13 season, Jackson's minutes and production steadily increased. In game 2 of the Thunder's first-round playoff series against the Houston Rockets, starting point guard Russell Westbrook tore his meniscus and was ruled out for the rest of the season, as Jackson was promoted to a starting role. In his first career start, he had 14 points, 2 rebounds and 1 assist, helping the Thunder win game 3. As a starter during the playoffs, Jackson averaged 15.3 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.7 assists per game.\nOn February 6, 2014, Jackson was chosen to compete in the 2014 Taco Bell Skills Challenge. On April 26, 2014, he recorded a career-high 32 points along with 9 rebounds against the Memphis Grizzlies in game 4 of the 2014 first-round playoff series, which the Thunder won 92–89. Jackson had 5 points in the final minute of regulation to force overtime, but heaved a shot from full court, still with 4 seconds left. In overtime, Jackson hit four free throws to ensure a Thunder victory. He was praised for his performance as the Thunder's star players Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook had off shooting nights.\nOn November 11, 2014, Jackson scored a season-high 29 points on 12-of-21 shooting in the 78–85 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.\nDetroit Pistons (2015–2020).\nOn February 19, 2015, Jackson was traded to the Detroit Pistons as part of a three-team deal that also involved the Utah Jazz. Three days later, he made his debut for the Pistons as he recorded 17 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in a 106–89 win over the Washington Wizards. On March 17, Jackson recorded 23 points and a career-high 20 assists in a 105–95 win over the Memphis Grizzlies. On March 27, Jackson recorded his second career triple-double just ten days later. Jackson finished the game with 26 points, 11 rebounds and ten assists in a 111–97 win over the Orlando Magic. Jackson became the first Pistons guard to record multiple triple-doubles in a season since Isiah Thomas during the 1986–87 season, and the first Pistons player to do so since Grant Hill during the 1997–98 season.\nOn July 20, 2015, the Pistons re-signed Jackson to a five-year, $80 million contract. On November 8, 2015, he recorded a career-high 40 points in a 120–103 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. He scored 26 of his 40 points in the fourth quarter, tying Will Bynum's franchise record for the most points in a quarter. On December 2, he had a season-best game with 34 points and 16 assists in a 127–122 overtime win over the Phoenix Suns. He was subsequently named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week ending December 6. He averaged 27.0 points and 8.8 assists, leading the Pistons to four consecutive wins during that time. Jackson became the first Piston to record 30-plus points and 15-plus assists in a game since Isiah Thomas recorded 40-plus points and 17 assists in 1988. Jackson was named the Eastern Conference Player of the Week for the week ending December 20, 2015. He joined Andre Drummond as the only Pistons teammates to win the award twice in the same season. Jackson averaged 29.3 points (first in the Eastern Conference), 7.7 assists (second in the Eastern Conference) and 6.3 rebounds while helping lead the Pistons to a 2–1 record for the week against three teams with above .500 records. He shot 46% from the field, 38% from behind the arc and 83% from the free-throw line. Jackson recorded two 30/10 games with 34 points and a season-high 11 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on December 14 and 31 points and 13 assists in a quadruple-overtime win against the Chicago Bulls on December 18. He scored 13 of the Pistons' 20 points in the deciding fourth overtime period. On April 8, 2016, he had 39 points and nine assists to help the Pistons defeat the Washington Wizards and clinch a spot in the postseason for the first time since 2009. The Pistons finished the regular season as the eighth seed in the Eastern Conference with a 44–38 record. However, in their first-round series against the first-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers, the Pistons were swept 4–0.\nOn October 10, 2016, Jackson received platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections to treat left knee tendinosis and an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) sprain of his right thumb. He was subsequently ruled out for six to eight weeks. After missing the first 21 games of the 2016–17 season, he made his season debut for the Pistons on December 4, scoring 18 points in 23 minutes against the Orlando Magic. On March 6, 2017, he scored 24 of his 26 points in the second half of the Pistons' 109–95 win over the Chicago Bulls. He made all 10 of his field goal attempts after halftime.\nOn December 26, 2017, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, Jackson suffered a grade 3 right ankle sprain and was subsequently ruled out for six to eight weeks. He returned to action on March 20, 2018, after missing 24 games. He scored seven points on 3-of-7 shooting in 15 minutes as a starter in a 115–88 win over the Phoenix Suns.\nOn February 2, 2019, Jackson scored 29 points in a 111–101 loss to the Clippers. On February 22, he scored a season-high 32 points in a 125–122 win over the Atlanta Hawks.\nOn February 18, 2020, Jackson was waived by the Pistons after a contract buyout agreement was reached.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2020–2023).\nOn February 20, 2020, Jackson signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. On December 1, 2020, Jackson re-signed with the Clippers.\nOn June 18, 2021, Jackson in the starting lineup with Paul George, Patrick Beverley and Terance Mann led the Clippers to their first Western Conference Finals appearance. In game 6, Jackson scored 27 points, but the Clippers lost in six games to the Phoenix Suns. Jackson averaged 17.8 points, 3.2 rebounds and 3.4 assists in the postseason.\nOn August 11, 2021, Jackson re-signed with the Clippers on a two-year contract. On November 23, 2021, Jackson scored 31 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in a loss against the Dallas Mavericks. On December 11, Jackson scored 25 points, including a game-winning basket with 2.2 seconds left in a 106–104 victory over the Magic. On February 26, 2022, Jackson scored 25 points and grabbed 8 rebounds, along with making a game-winning layup with 4.1 seconds remaining, in a 111–110 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.\nOn November 29, 2022, Jackson scored 24 points, recorded 12 assists, and grabbed 7 rebounds during a 118–112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers.\nOn February 9, 2023, Jackson and a future second-round pick were traded to the Charlotte Hornets in exchange for Mason Plumlee. Three days later, Jackson and the Hornets reached a contract buyout agreement.\nDenver Nuggets (2023–present).\nOn February 14, 2023, Jackson signed with the Denver Nuggets. Jackson won his first NBA championship when the Nuggets defeated Miami Heat in the 2023 NBA Finals.\nOn July 16, 2023, Jackson re-signed with the Denver Nuggets.\nOn November 27, 2023, Jackson scored a season high 35 points on 79% shooting, along with 13 assists, 5 rebounds, and 2 steals, leading a depleted Denver squad to a 113–104 road victory over his former team in the Los Angeles Clippers.\nPersonal life.\nJackson earned the nicknames 'Big Government' from fans during his Clippers tenure due to his ability to \"bail them out\" with clutch performances in important games; and 'Mr. June', in reference to the Hall of Fame Major League Baseball player, Reggie Jackson, who earned the nickname of 'Mr. October' due to how well he played in the MLB postseason."

        "title": "Oslo bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Oslo–Lillehammer 2018 was a proposal for Oslo and Lillehammer, Norway, to bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics. Along with the Trondheim and Tromsø bids, it was one of three options for the Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports (NIF), who ultimately chose to not bid for the games. Oslo announced the bid in September 2006, and the official proposal report was published in February 2007.\nCompared to the other Norwegian bids, Oslo–Lillehammer presented the best infrastructure, transport and accommodation. The bid called for using existing venues for Alpine, Nordic and freestyle skiing, snowboarding, curling and sliding sports, although new venues would need to be built for ice hockey and skating. Major existing venues which would be used included Holmenkollen National Arena, Tryvann Vinterpark and Jordal Amfi in Oslo, and Hafjell, Kvitfjell and Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track in the Lillehammer area. All venues would be accessible by rail, including most of the Oslo venues by the Oslo Metro. The main Olympic Village would be built in Bjørvika and the media center in Lohavn. The bid's major downside was the distance between Oslo and Kvitfjell. The choice of those venues over Norefjell was subject to criticism and debate. Political support for Oslo was lower than for Tromsø, as the authorities prioritized regional policies in their support for candidates.\nBackground.\nNorway has hosted two Winter Olympics, the 1952 Games in Oslo and the 1994 Games in Lillehammer. Oslo has applied four times previously to host the games, in 1932, 1944, 1952 and 1968. A proposal was also made for Oslo to bid for 1980, but the application was never sent. In 2002, the five municipalities that had hosted the 1994 Olympics stated their intent to apply for the 2014 Winter Olympics. They hoped a new Olympics would stimulate the Oppland and Hedmark region, and focused on the reuse of the existing venues. At the same time, officials from Oslo also stated that they intended to bid for the same or later games.\nAhead of the bids for the 2014 Winter Olympics, Tromsø launched a proposal. It was seen both as a possibility to develop Northern Norway, and a way to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution of Norway. The proposal was rejected by the Bondevik's Second Cabinet, who stated that there should be more than 20 years between each time Norway hosted the Olympics. They were also concerned about the costs of the project. The opposition supported the Tromsø bid, stated it was important for regional development. Gerhard Heiberg, Norway's representative in the International Olympic Committee (IOC), described the project as unrealistic and that a better application would be needed to compete with bids such as Sochi's. The application was finally dismissed by the NIF board in July 2005.\nOn 23 June 2006, the NIF board announced that they planned to apply for the 2018 Winter Olympics, and asked for bids from Norwegian cities wanting to host the games. Oslo city councilor Anette Wiig Bryn announced on 25 August that Oslo planned to bid for the 2018 Olympics. It was the third city to announce it would apply to become the Norwegian applicant for the games, after both Tromsø and Trondheim had previously made announcements. The planning was given a municipal grant of 6 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Oslo Mayor Per Ditlev-Simonsen stated that the Oslo bid would include Norefjell rather than the Lillehammer venues. The Oslo and Lillehammer cooperation was announced on 13 September.\nVenues and infrastructure.\nHolmenkollen National Arena was completely rebuilt ahead of the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships 2011. It features the large ski jumping hill Holmenkollbakken and the normal hill Midtstubakken, along with a cross-country skiing stadium. The large hill and the stadium were both used during the 1952 Olympics. Cross-country sprint were planned located at Tøyen Park. Biathlon was planned to be located at Lillomarka, where a multi-sport venue was planned built. The snowboard and freestyle events are planned split between Wyllerløypa, part of Tryvann Vinterpark, and Grefsenkleiva, part of Oslo Skisenter. Both are existing recreational areas for Alpine skiing and snowboard and within the city. Wyllerløypa was used during the 1952 Olympics for slalom.\nJordal Amfi was the only existing ice rink proposed for the Olympics. It was built as an outdoor venue for ice hockey at the 1952 Winter Olympics. The venue would need a major upgrade to be suitable the 2018 Games, for which it was planned to host curling. Valle Hovin was at the time of the application an outdoor speed skating rink. Independent of the Olympic application, plans exist to rebuild it as an indoor venue. Oslo Podium was primarily planned as a national stadium for handball, for which Norway several times has hosted world and European championships, and for which Oslo lacks a suitable venue. It was planned to be located at Hasle and built independent of Oslo hosting the Winter Olympics, but the plans for the venue were canceled in 2009, after the Norwegian Handball Federation had not made up their mind, and Oslo Municipality needed the lot for a school. The venue would have been owned by the federation. Two more new ice rinks were planned, at Stubberud and Mortensrud. The former would feature ice hockey, while the latter would host figure skating and short-track speed skating.\nThree venues would be located in the Lillehammer area; all three of them were used during the 1994 Winter Olympics. Hafjell would have hosted the slalom and giant slalom tournaments, while Kvitfjell would feature downhill and super-G. Both are regularly used in the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup and Kvitfjell is part of Club 5+. Kvitfjell would need a new downhill course. If IOC requirements changed so a single arena for all Alpine sports was needed, the technical disciplines could be moved from Hafjell to Kvitfjell. Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track, located at Hunderfossen, would feature bobsleigh, luge and skeleton. The track is the only one in Northern Europe.\nThe main Olympic Village would be located in Bjørvika, on waterfront property in downtown Oslo. In addition, a smaller Olympic village would be built in Hafjell. The Oslo village would have 3,000 rooms and 4,500 beds, while the Hafjell Village would have 700 rooms and 1,000 beds. As of 2007, the Oslo region has 10,500 hotel beds and the Lillehammer area 3,200 beds, most of which would be rented by the organizing committee. Additional accommodation capacity could be generated by using 50,000 beds in cabins and rental apartments in the Lillehammer area and 10,000 hotel beds in a distance of from the venues, and the use of cruise ships docked at the Port of Oslo. The media center and international broadcasting center were to be located at Lohavn, with media accommodation being located at Lohavn and Filipstad. All Oslo accommodation and media facilities are part of the Fjord City project. Opening, closing and medal ceremonies in Oslo would be held at Rådhusplassen, a square in the city center. In Lillehammer, the medal ceremonies would have been located at Stortorget, the main square in the town.\nThe location of the venues was such that all sites in Oslo would be located on the Oslo Metro or the Oslo Tramway, and the Lillehammer venues would all be located on the Dovre Line. Athletes, officials and VIPs would be transported using buses and dedicated cars on closed-off roads. Oslo's public transport system transported at the time of the application 500,000 people per day, with large vacant capacity between the rush hours. Transport between Oslo and the Lillehammer area would be done using railway, as well as European Route E6 and National Road 4 In 2007, travel time by train from Oslo to Lillehammer was 125 minutes, to Hafjell and Hunderfossen 140 minutes, and to Kvitfjell 168 minutes. Oslo Airport, Gardermoen is located between Oslo and Lillehammer; the Airport Express Train has a travel time of 19 minutes to Oslo Central Station, while the regional train uses 105 minutes to Lillehammer. Sandefjord Airport, Torp and Moss Airport, Rygge can both be used as reserve airports.\nThe application states that Oslo plans to build the venues in places were they can be used for recreation after the games. Hafjell, Kvitfjell, Tryvann and Grefsen are privately owned, and for these, commercial operations will resume also after the Olympics. The placement of the venues is part of the municipality's strategy to decrease the differences between the East End and West End of Oslo.\nEvaluation and outcome.\nThe Oslo bid was one of three submitted to NIF, along with Trondheim and Tromsø. The three bids were evaluated, based on the same criteria that IOC uses to evaluate bids, by a committee led by Odd Martinsen. They concluded that Oslo was the most suited, followed by Trondheim and Tromsø. The decision for a Norwegian applicant was taken by the NIF board on 30 March 2007. In the first round of voting, only Geir Kvillum voted for Trondheim. In the following round, both Oslo and Tromsø received six votes, and President Odd-Roar Thorsen received the decisive vote. The bid for Tromsø was later discarded by NIF; three independent reports all concluded that the town was not suited to host the games, in particular because of lack of suitable transport, accommodation and post-Olympic use of venues.\nOne controversial part of the Oslo bid was the choice of Hafjell and Kvitfjell over Norefjell for Alpine skiing. Norefjell was used for downhill during the 1952 Olympics, and is significantly closer to Oslo than Hafjell and Kvitfjell. Per Ditlev-Simonsen stated that he and the committee originally planned to bid with Norefjell, but that Gerhard Heiberg had recommended that Oslo instead bid with Hafjell and Kvitfjell. IOC President Jacques Rogge later stated that with the distance of between Oslo and the Alpine venues would make it impossible to be selected. In a documentary made by the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation, it was stated that Heiberg was in favor of the Tromsø bid, and recommended Oslo to bid with Hafjell and Kvitfjell to reduce their chances of being selected national candidate.\nFollowing the Nordic World Ski Champions held at Holmenkollen in 2011, the debate about Norway hosting the Olympic Games surfaced again. Martin Rimpi, project leader for Tromsø 2018, stated after the world championships that it was unlikely that Tromsø would be a future candidate. He also stated that if a high-speed railway was built between Oslo and Lillehammer, travel time between the towns would be short enough for IOC to accept a bid."

There were thirteen fighters from three continents (Europe, Africa and North America) taking part in the competition. Each of the matches was three rounds of two minutes each and were fought under Semi-Contact rules.\nDue to the fact there were too few men for a tournament intended for sixteen, three of the fighters received byes through to the quarter-final stage. The tournament winner was Italy's Marco Culiersi who defeated Ireland's Andy Hogan by points decision in the final to claim gold.

        "title": "Tennis New Zealand",
        "text": " Tennis New Zealand (commonly known by the acronym Tennis NZ or TNZ) (formally the New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association) is the governing body of tennis in New Zealand. Founded in 1886, it is one of the world's oldest tennis associations. It is affiliated to both International Tennis Federation and Oceania Tennis Federation. Tennis NZ has six geographically divided regional centres. Tennis NZ operates all of the New Zealand's national representative tennis sides, including the New Zealand Davis Cup team, the New Zealand Billie Jean King Cup team and youth sides as well. Tennis NZ is also responsible for organising and hosting tennis tournaments within New Zealand and scheduling the home international fixtures.\nHistory.\nThe history of tennis in New Zealand dates back to the 1870s, the decade when the development of modern tennis began. The first \"New Zealand Tennis Championships\" were played at Farndon Park in Clive, Hawke's Bay, in December 1885. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association (NZLTA) was formed at a meeting held in Hastings in December 1886. Shortly after its inauguration, the New Zealand Association became affiliated with the Lawn Tennis Association (England).\nIn 1904 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association amalgamated with six Australian state tennis associations to form the Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association played a significant role in the origin of the Australian Open. Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia created the tournament called \"The Australasian Mens Championships\" (which later became Australian Open) in 1905 and was first played in Warehouseman's Cricket Ground and it was decided that championships would be hosted by both Australian as well as New Zealand venues. New Zealand hosted the championship twice— Christchurch (1906) and Hastings (1912). The geographical remoteness of both the countries (Australia and New Zealand) made it difficult for foreign players to enter the tournament. In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France, on 1 March 1913. From 1905 until 1919, New Zealand and Australian tennis players participated in the International Lawn Tennis Challenge (Davis Cup) under the alias of \"Team Australasia\", the team claimed a title six times (1907, 1908, 1909, 1911, 1914, 1919), however, there were attempts to severance this trans-Tasman partnership, in order to allow New Zealand players to represent their nation on international tennis events. In 1922, New Zealand dropped out from this partnership and on 16 March 1923 New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association was granted affiliation to the International Lawn Tennis Association and thereby became eligible to enter the International Lawn Tennis Challenge in its own right. New Zealand Lawn Tennis Association filed its first challenge with United States Lawn Tennis Association for 1924 International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Tennis New Zealand was the founding member of Oceania Tennis Federation in 1993.\nConstitution.\nThe constitution of the organisation was adopted on 12 August 2006 in the \"Special General Meeting\" in which the main purpose of the organisation is defined as to promote, develop, enhance and protect the sport of tennis mainly as an amateur sport for the recreation and entertainment of the general public in New Zealand.\nAffiliates.\nRegional centres.\nTennis NZ consists of six regional centres which are affiliated to the national body. They control their own activities subject to any requirements which may, from time to time, be legislated for by the national body.\nOrganisations.\nTennis NZ affiliates several different tennis related private organisations, which are: \nTournaments.\nTennis NZ annually organises range of events from local tournaments to national and international events. Tennis Auckland hosts two major events of international tennis tournaments each year at the ASB Tennis Centre, Parnell, just prior to Australian Open:"

        "text": "The Meadow Brook Club is a private golf club in Jericho, New York, Long Island, New York, United States. \nFrom 1894 to 1954 it was part of a hunting club, which soon evolved into a major polo club. \nAfter the original grounds were expropriated for urban development, it moved to its present location and became primarily a golf club.\nThe Meadowbrook Polo Club is now a separate entity.\nOrigins.\nThe club originated as the Meadow Brook Hunt Club, established in 1881 in Westbury, New York and home of the Meadow Brook Hounds.\nThe hunt club had its headquarters in Westbury, but convened in different rural parts of Nassau County where the hounds and horses could run free. Future President Theodore Roosevelt was a member of the hunt club, which met at his home in Oyster Bay in 1886. The members sometimes hunted foxes, but often drag hunted, where the hounds followed a trail of anise scent.\nThe Hunt Club gave birth to the Meadowbrook Polo Club, whose founders included the polo player and millionaire Thomas Hitchcock, Sr. (1862-1941).\nHitchcock was one of the founders of the Meadow Brook steeplechase races in 1883, and in 1889 became master of the Meadow Brook Hunt.\nThe club in Westbury had eight polo fields, and was the leading polo center in the United States.\nDuring the first half of the 20th century the polo club was often the site for national or international polo championships.\nFirst course.\nA nine-hole golf course was built for the Meadow Brook Club in 1894.\nIt was located in Hempstead, New York.\nIn 1895 the first national women's golf tournament was held at Meadow Brook.\nThe winner was Lucy Barnes, wife of Charles S. Brown, with 132 strokes for the eighteen-hole match.\nThe club became an early member of the United States Golf Association.\nOn 31 March 1897 the Metropolitan Golf Association was formed at Delmonico's in New York City, at first called the Metropolitan League of Golf Clubs. \nOliver W. Bird of Meadow Brook Golf Club was a member of the five-person formation committee.\nIn 1936 Sam Snead won two matches at the Meadow Brook Club, earning a $10,000 fee. \nThis gave him the money he needed to start playing professionally full time.\nPresent course.\nThe original polo ground and golf course was requisitioned by New York City Park Commissioner Robert Moses for a parkway extension.\nThe Meadowbrook State Parkway extension of 1954 cut through the club property from north to south.\nThe polo club moved to Post Road in Old Westbury, New York, in 1954.\nA new entity was formed, now called the Meadowbrook Polo Club, which continued to arrange polo matches on Long Island.\nIn the 1990s it hosted two U.S. Open Championships at Bethpage State Park.\nA new site for a golf course in Jericho, New York was selected in October 1953 by Dick Wilson, the architect of the course.\nWilson drew up plans for the course in just six weeks.\nConstruction began in April 1954 by Troup Brothers of Miami, who undertook the heavy-duty earth movement. \nIrrigation and drainage pipes and tile beds were installed in the summer, and grass sown in the fall.\nSeaside bent was used for the greens and a mix of Astoria bent and Chewings fescue for the fairways.\nWith the move to Jericho the Meadow Brook Club changed into a golf club.\nThe course was officially opened for play on 4 June 1955.\nThe course has championship tees up to in length.\nIt has been host to regional tournaments such as the Metropolitan PGA Championships, the Metropolitan Open and the Lightpath Long Island Classic.\nRecently Tripp Davis renovated the course, placing more emphasis on interest than on challenge.\nReferences.\nSources"

After going 11-14 with a 2.91 ERA for the Knoxville Sox in 1976, he earned a late-season call-up to Chicago. He made his big league debut on August 23 against the Detroit Tigers, throwing two scoreless, hitless innings of relief. He earned his only decision in the majors on September 30. He started that day's game against the California Angels, going five innings, giving up six hits and four runs (three earned), and walking two to take the loss. Returning to Knoxville in 1977, he continued to play through 1979.\nAfter his playing days, Monroe worked for the White Sox in various capacities. When Adrian Garrett replaced Vern Law as manager of the Denver Zephyrs in 1984, Monroe was brought in to become pitching coach. He was vice president of scouting and minor league operations from 1990 to 1994 and was vice president of free agent and major league scouting from that time until 2000. Monroe was an integral part of the advanced scouting team, which aided the Chicago White Sox in winning the 2005 World Series. More recently, he was an advisor to the baseball department through 2020.\nCurrently Monroe runs the personal pitching training business, Monroe Pitching, geared to young men looking to improve their individual talents.\nMonroe is the author of \"Best-Kept Secrets of Major League Pitching\". Monroe's son, Grant Monroe, was drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 38th round of the 2007 amateur draft and again in the 46th round of the 2009 amateur draft."

Davidson signed for Salford's Academy from amateur club Blackbrook Royals, after previously playing for Wigan St Patrick's and Westhoughton Lions. He has international accolades at under 16 level, after playing in a test series against France Schoolboys in 2009.

The demands of the, then, Head Coach and the interpretation of the contract rules led to that strong team succumbing to two successive losses and not gaining entry to the Grand Final. Nevertheless, a great year for Alex and his teammates.\nAlex spent the early weeks of 2013 at Leigh Centurions an arrangement which didn't really suit either party.

The selection was made at the 70th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Amsterdam on 12 May 1970. The year 1976 was the centennial for the state of Colorado and bicentennial for the United States.\nIn early 1972, the venues for the skiing events were changed to established areas west of the continental divide, approved by the IOC in February. Alpine events were moved to Vail from the undeveloped Mount Sniktau (and Loveland Ski Area) east of Loveland Pass, and the Nordic events moved from Evergreen to Steamboat Springs. The original sites submitted in the 1970 bid satisfied a requirement of proximity to the Olympic Village (at the University of Denver).\nLater that year on 7 November, Colorado voters rejected in a referendum to partially fund the games, and for the first time a city awarded an Olympics rejected them. Denver officially withdrew on 15 November, and original runner-up Sion declined to host the Olympics. Afterwards, the IOC then offered the Olympics to Whistler, British Columbia, Canada, but they too declined, owing to a change of government following elections. Whistler was later part of neighbouring Vancouver's successful bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nSalt Lake City, Utah, initially offered to host, then pulled its bid, and was replaced by Lake Placid, New York. However, the IOC, still reeling from the Denver rejection, declined the bid for Lake Placid.\nAt a meeting of the IOC executive committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 4 February 1973, the 1976 Winter Olympics were transferred from Denver to Innsbruck, which had recently hosted in 1964. The next Winter Olympics were in the United States at Lake Placid (awarded in October 1974), and Salt Lake City hosted in 2002."

        "text": "The selection process for the 1988 Winter Olympics consisted of three bids, and saw Calgary, Alberta, Canada, be selected ahead of Falun, Sweden, and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The selection was made at the 84th International Olympic Committee (IOC) Session in Baden-Baden, West Germany, on 30 September 1981.\nBackground.\nCalgary was one of three cities and towns that bid officially for the 1988 Winter Olympics. The other two were Falun, Sweden, and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The Italian town (comune) had before hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics. The IOC required formal bids to be submitted by November 30, 1980.\nThe vote was held on September 30, 1981, in Baden-Baden, West Germany, during the 84th IOC Session and 11th Olympic Congress. After Cortina d'Ampezzo was eliminated in the first round of balloting, Calgary won in the second and final round of balloting over Falun, by a margin of 17 votes.\nCandidate cities overview.\nCalgary.\nCalgary's bid for the 1988 Winter Olympic Games was Canada's seventh and Calgary's fourth attempt at hosting the Winter Games. The first Canadian bid for Winter Games was organized by the City of Montreal in 1956. At the 43rd Olympic Congress, Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy was chosen as the host for the 1956 Winter Games on the first ballot with 31 votes, and Montreal came second with 7 votes. The Canadian Olympic Committee previously submitted two bids for the City of Vancouver, first for 1976 which was awarded to Denver, and Vancouver was eliminated on the first ballot; and secondly for the 1980 Games which was withdrawn prior to the Olympic Congress when the new provincial government under Premier Dave Barrett withdrew support for the bid. The Canadian Olympic Committee had previously submitted three bids for Calgary, first under the direction of the Calgary Olympic Development Association (CODA) for the 1964 Games where Calgary finished second to Innsbruck, Austria; the second attempt for the 1968 Games saw Grenoble, France awarded the Games on the third ballot with 27 votes to Calgary's 24 votes; and the third attempt was for the 1972 Games for the nearby Town of Banff which finished second to Sapporo, Japan. After the unsuccessful bid for the 1972 Games, the third consecutive failed bid, CODA was laid dormant.\nIn 1978, CODA was revived by Frank King and Bob Niven of Calgary's Booster Club, who took over the organization's leadership. King and Niven brought some members from previous bids back including former Olympic Sprinter and CODA founder Ernie McCullough, and politician Arthur Ryan Smith to consult on the project.\nIn October 1979, CODA was able to secure the Canadian Olympic Association's (COA) support as Canada's official bid for the 1988 Winter Olympics over a competing bid by Vancouver by a vote of 27–9. Calgary's bid was bold, estimated at million, CODA proposed constructing all new venues to overcome the city's lack of winter sports facilities with the argument that Canada's inventory of elite sport training facilities would grow significantly if Calgary was awarded the Games. The defeated Vancouver organizing group lamented that they lost to Calgary's \"Big-ticket Games\" idea, which was estimated to cost nearly three times what the Vancouver group was expected to pay to host the Winter Olympics. Vancouver's low-cost bid which was estimated at million, leveraged already developed infrastructure, including the Pacific Coliseum and Whistler Blackcomb, although the low estimated cost was met with skepticism from COA delegates. Delegates noted that the previous loss of provincial support in the 1980 Vancouver bid, the possible financial security of Alberta's newly created Heritage Savings Trust Fund, and Calgary's commitment to amateur sport development weighed heavily on results.\nNext, CODA spent two years building local support for the megaproject, selling largely symbolic memberships to approximately 80,000 of Calgary's 600,000 residents. Calgary had further secured significant funding commitments from the Government of Canada totalling million, and Alberta's government totalling million (with an additional million loan), while some civic leaders, including then-mayor Ralph Klein, crisscrossed the world to favour IOC delegates. Driven by the arrival of the National Hockey League's (NHL) newly relocated Calgary Flames from Atlanta in 1980, the city had already begun constructing a new NHL arena that would be later named the Olympic Saddledome. That course of action demonstrated to the IOC Calgary's determination in wanting to host the Winter Olympics.\nCalgary's bid grew in size and scope between 1979 and 1981. The bid book presented at the 84th IOC session had an estimated total cost of million, with million in operating costs and million in capital costs. An additional million was allocated for an endowment fund to cover additional operating costs and another million for a contingency fund. The largest included cost was the construction of the new 18,000-seat arena, budgeted for million, which would host ice hockey and figure skating. Preliminary ice hockey and figure skating events were to be scheduled at the already-constructed Stampede Corral and Max Bell Arena. Other Calgary-based facilities included the million Olympic Oval for speed skating, which the bid considered, but did not commit to being an indoor facility. The nearby Bragg Creek area was designated as the host location for million ski jumping facility, million bobsleigh and luge facility, and a million cross-country and biathlon facility. A new Alpine Centre was set to be built in the Spray Lake area on Mount Sparrowhawk and Mount Shark at a cost of million to host alpine skiing events. In the lead-up to the Games, OCO'88 relocated each proposed venue, except the Olympic Oval.\nIn the days leading up to the selection, OCO'88 made a number of changes to entice the IOC delegates to choose Calgary. OCO'88 committed million to subsidize travel for athletes participating in the Games, this came after concerns from European delegations that travel to North America would be more expensive than the two European bids.\nCalgary's Olympic bid itself emphasized the cultural and natural beauty of Calgary and surrounding areas, as an asset for hosting the Winter Olympics. The city was marketed as a capitalist, oil-driven, and modern economy that also had mountain playgrounds, extensive wilderness, and western rodeo culture. The two seemingly contradictory images were brought together, as part of an extensive and diverse lobbying program.\nCODA spent around $2.5 million on the bid process which included technical studies, and tours for 32 of the 82 IOC delegates in what was described as \"VIP style\".\nFalun.\nThe Falun for the 1988 Winter Games was unsuccessful. A key issue identified by IOC officials was the lack of acceptable locations where alpine events could be hosted near the city. The Falun bid planned to host alpine events approximately 400 kilometres away from the city. The Falun organizers had many of the necessary facilities already built and had a budget of million. Falun organizers called for reform in the bidding process, noting they were not sure what the IOC used to choose successful bids, and Lennart Hallberg stated \"It would be far better if the rules were simpler, clear and the whole competition was like a tendering process.\"\nCortina d'Ampezzo.\nCortina d'Ampezzo previously hosted the 1956 Winter Olympics. The Cortina d'Ampezzo bid operating budget was not released during the bidding process, and was kept secret from IOC members. After the Games were awarded to Calgary, Cortina d'Ampezzo officials claimed they expected to spend between $5–$50 million on the Games if they had won.\nAftermath.\nThe announcement of CODA's victory sent the delegates in Baden-Baden and Calgary residents into singing and dancing. It also made then Alberta premier, Peter Lougheed, burst openly into tears in front of the cameras. Later, Ralph Klein sang a rendition of Mac Davis' \"It's Hard to Be Humble\". It was the first Winter Olympics awarded to Canada and the second Olympic Games overall, following the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. Cortina d'Ampezzo, along with Milan, would get to host the 2026 Winter Olympics. The town would be the fourth one to host the Winter Olympics twice, along with St. Moritz (1928 and 1948), Lake Placid (1932 and 1980), and Innsbruck (1964 and 1976).\nOlympic historians, John E. Findling and Kimberly D. Pelle, noted that once the Games were awarded to Calgary, the cultural and community aspects of the bid were pushed aside by the newly formed Calgary Olympic organizing committee called the \"Olympiques Calgary Olympics '88\" (OCO'88). It then proceeded to take on a \"vigorous, resilient, and impersonal corporate business strategy\" towards the planning and operation of the Games."

Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC.\nThis season marked a change in location and name for the annual game with Missouri. The name was altered from the \"Show-Me Classic\" to the \"Braggin' Rights\" and took on a permanent location, St. Louis, with the St. Louis Arena as its original home.

The main feature of the year was the World Cup final that was played at Eden Park. Australia defeated New Zealand in the final 25–12. Auckland won the National Provincial Competition.\nInternational competitions.\nWorld Cup final.\nNew Zealand met Australia in the World Cup final, the culmination of four years of competition. At the end of four years, Australia finished top of the table, and, through their victory over Great Britain in Christchurch, the Kiwis qualified to host the final. The final was played at Eden Park, the first occasion that rugby league had used the ground since 1919. Prior to kick-off Graham Brazier performed the New Zealand national anthem.\nNew Zealand:\nAustralia:\nDue to the inexperience of the Australian team, the hosts went into the match as favourites in the eyes of many critics. However, the Wally Lewis-led Kangaroos – boasting the likes of Ben Elias, Allan Langer, Paul Sironen and David Gillespie among their 'inexperienced' – triumphed over the ill-disciplined Kiwis, who at least made sure the victorious Australians were bloodied and bruised for their victory lap. For the Kiwis, the Iro brothers, Dean Bell, Gary Freeman, Clayton Friend, Mark Graham, Adrian Shelford and Kurt Sorensen dished out the punishment.\nThe New Zealand Rugby League called for an inquiry after the result. It was revealed that Gary Mercer was carrying a rib injury before into match and, in hindsight, should not have played in the final. After the match the NZRL stated that it would use Eden Park again in the future, however it did not hold another Test match until 2010, during the Four Nations. A week before the final a Wellington Invitational side gave Australia a solid warm up match, losing 12–24.\nOther international competitions.\nEarlier in the season the New Zealand national rugby league team played in several other Test series, included two matches that counted towards the World Cup. In February a Presidents XIII lost 38–6 to the new Brisbane Broncos franchise at Lang Park. The team was captained by Barry Harvey. An Auckland v Rest of New Zealand match was held as a Kiwis trial, with Auckland winning 32–6. An hour later Tony Gordon announced his team for the World Cup clash against Papua New Guinea. The team was: Darrell Williams, Shane Horo, Gary Mercer, captain Dean Bell, Kevin Iro, Shane Cooper, Clayton Friend, Adrian Shelford, Peter Brown, Mike Brady, Mark Graham, Sam Stewart, Mark Horo. Reserves: Esene Faimalo and Gary Freeman. The Kiwis won 66–14 in front of 9,000 fans at Carlaw Park. PNG had earlier beaten Midlands and Waikato 58-0 and 38-12 respectively. After the Test match they defeated Northland 58-14 before heading home via Australia.\nThe Kiwis victory set up a must win clash with Great Britain the following Sunday, with the winner advancing to the final. The final Test of the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour of Australasia, it was held at Addington Showgrounds and was won 12-10 by the Kiwis, with Gary Freeman scoring both tries. The weekend earlier Great Britain had defeated Wellington 24–18. After the Test match Great Britain ended their 18 match tour of Papua New Guinea, Australia and New Zealand by playing Auckland. Auckland, fielding a relatively inexperienced side, won 30–14.\nAs part of the Australian Bicentenary, the Kangaroos played a Rest of the World side coached by Graham Lowe. The side included eight players from New Zealand; Gary Mercer, Dean Bell, Kevin Iro, Shane Cooper, Wayne Wallace, Adrian Shelford, Mark Graham who captained the side and Sam Stewart.\nThe New Zealand Māori side, coached by Richard Bolton, played three games during the season.

        "text": "George Rezin Elder Jr. (March 10, 1921 – July 7, 2022) was an American professional baseball outfielder. He played one season in Major League Baseball, appearing in 41 games with the St. Louis Browns in 1949.\nEarly life.\nElder was born in Lebanon, Kentucky, in March 1921, the youngest of four children of George Rezin Elder and Mary Ellen \"Lilly\" Elder. His mother died when George Jr. was one; the family moved to Louisville, Kentucky, in the 1920s, then a few years later to Chicago and finally to Los Angeles. He served as a Marine artilleryman in the Pacific theatre, including in the Battle of Iwo Jima. \nElder was a running back for the Fordham University football team. He considered attending the University of Notre Dame, where his brother Jack had been a running back. Elder, who ran the 100-yard dash in 9.9 seconds, said that he chose Fordham to avoid comparisons to his brother. Elder ended up playing for the freshman team in 1941 and the varsity team in 1942. In October 1942, he sustained a broken foot in a game against West Virginia University. \nIn the summer of 1943, Fordham shut down its football program. Elder went to Dartmouth College that fall as part of the V-12 Navy College Training Program. When he arrived at Dartmouth, he was described as dealing with some chronic injuries, and he elected to play baseball instead of football. After serving in the Marine Corps in World War II and seeing action at Iwo Jima, Elder was discharged and finished college at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he also played for the UCLA baseball team.\nBaseball career.\nIn 1947 and 1948, Elder appeared with the Toledo Mud Hens, a minor league affiliate of the St. Louis Browns. In the spring of 1948, he was also named to the UCLA baseball coaching staff. He played for several other minor league teams before making his major league debut as a pinch-runner on July 22, 1949. Two days later he made his first plate appearance, with a single against Ellis Kinder, scoring Paul Lehner. It was the game-winning hit in a 9–8 Browns win.\nIn Elder's lone major league season, he started seven games and appeared on defense in 10 games (all in left field). He was used as a pinch hitter 22 times, and he appeared as a pinch runner 11 times. Elder spent only one more season in professional baseball. He tallied 11 hits in 44 official at bats for a .250 batting average, with three doubles and two runs batted in. Elder played for the Wichita Indians, a Browns affiliate, in 1950, hitting .284 in 144 games. Before his death in 2022, he was one of only four living former St. Louis Browns players, along with Billy Hunter, Ed Mickelson, and Frank Saucier.\nPersonal life.\nElder spent his later years as a Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy and as a bailiff in a court in Santa Monica, California. \nHe was later married to Helen Bennett. Elder was married a second time, in 1985, to Mary Ann. He started training horses with his wife Mary Ann. In 2005 they moved to Fruita, Colorado, where they lived as of 2020. He turned 100 in March 2021.\nFollowing the death of Eddie Robinson on October 4, 2021, Elder became the oldest living former major league baseball player. He died in Fruita, Colorado, on July 7, 2022, at the age of 101."

        "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish women's basketball team is the intercollegiate women's basketball program representing University of Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. The program currently competes in the Atlantic Coast Conference of NCAA Division I. The Fighting Irish play their home games in the Purcell Pavilion at the Edmund P. Joyce Center, and are currently coached by Niele Ivey.\nHistory.\nFormer coach Muffet McGraw was the women's head coach from 1987 to 2020 and led the Irish to two national championships in 2001 and 2018. The Irish's first national championship team in 2001 was led by 6-foot-5 center and future WNBA star Ruth Riley, who led the Irish past Purdue 68–66. \nUnder McGraw's stewardship, Notre Dame has reached the Final Four nine times (1997, 2001, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2018 and 2019), which currently ranks 5th all time in NCAA history. Notre Dame has made it to the Sweet Sixteen in each of the last ten seasons (2010–19), has won 20 or more games in 24 of the past 25 seasons, and has won 30 or more games in eight consecutive seasons (2011–19). The Irish have made 26 NCAA tournament appearances as of the end of the 2018–19 season, including a current streak of 24 appearances. In the current streak, Notre Dame has made it to the second round in all but one of the appearances.\nMcGraw would take the Fighting Irish back to the Final Four in 2011 under the play of star point guard Skylar Diggins, beating Pat Summitt's Tennessee Lady Volunteers; the program's first win against the Lady Vols in 21 tries. That win was followed by an upset of the number one-ranked UConn Huskies (making Notre Dame the first team ever to beat both Tennessee and UConn in the same tournament) to advance the Fighting Irish to the 2011 championship game, where it lost to Texas A&amp;M. The Irish would return to the championship game in 2012, losing to unbeaten Baylor after winning the Big East regular season title and beating UConn again to reach the final.\nIn the 2012–2013 season, the Irish, led by Diggins and shooting guard Kayla McBride, posted their best regular season record in school history (31–1), despite losing Big East defensive player of the year Devereaux Peters and two other starters to graduation. Their only regular season loss was to Baylor, and the team posted wins over #9 Tennessee in Knoxville and a narrow 1 point at #1 Connecticut. The Irish completed an undefeated 16–0 Big East regular season championship vs #3 Connecticut in the final game of the season, winning a triple overtime thriller to close out Diggins’ career in South Bend. UConn and Notre Dame would again meet in the Big East Tournament final, with Notre Dame winning narrowly 61–59 to claim their first ever Big East tournament championship. Notre Dame had lost to UConn in the finale 6 previous times.\nNotre Dame made it to the national championship game in 2014 and 2015, twice losing to Connecticut.\nAfter an injury plagued start to the 2017–18 season, which saw four Irish players lost to injury, Notre Dame won its second national championship by beating Mississippi State 61–58. Junior guard Arike Ogunbowale scored the game winning three point shot with one-tenth of a second left, two days after scoring a similar buzzer beater to knock out Connecticut in the semifinal game. The win was coach McGraw's second national championship and 800th win at Notre Dame. Four of the returning five starters, including Ogunbowale, Jackie Young, Marina Mabrey and Jessica Shepard, returned to the Final Four the following year. The Irish would beat Uconn 81–76 before falling by 1 point to Baylor, 82–81.\nThe Irish are now coached under former player and star Niele Ivey, who in her third season has led the team to an ACC regular season conference championship and a trip to the sweet sixteen.\nAwards and honors.\nNational awards.\nPlayers.\nNaismith College Player of the Year\nAP National Player of the Year\nSports Illustrated National Player of the Year\nNCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player\nNancy Lieberman Award\nElite 90 Award\nCoaches.\nNaismith College Coach of the Year\nAP Coach of the Year\nWBCA Coach of the Year\nUSBWA Coach of the Year\nConference awards.\nPlayers.\nACC Athlete of the Year\nACC Player of the Year\nACC Defensive Player of the Year\nACC Rookie of the Year\nBig East Player of the Year\nBig East Freshman of the Year\nBig East Defensive Player of the Year\nMidwestern Collegiate Conference/Horizon League Player of the Year\nNorth Star Conference Player of the Year\nCoaches.\nACC Coach of the Year\nBig East Coach of the Year\nMidwestern Collegiate Conference/Horizon League Coach of the Year\nNorth Star Conference Coach of the Year\nNCAA Tournament history.\nNotre Dame has played in 27 NCAA Tournaments with a record of 69–25."

        "text": "For the Summer Olympics, there are 32 venues that have been or will be used for sailing. Most competitions took place for the early part of the Olympics at or near venues, but no specific yacht or sailing club was listed in the official Olympic report. In 1920, the twelve-foot dinghy event set for Ostend was moved to the Netherlands at special request of the Belgian Olympic Committee. The first specific yacht or sailing club to host the competitions took place in 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City though those competitions took place actually in Acapulco. Eight years later in Montreal, the competitions took place on the Great Lakes in Kingston, Ontario, marking the first and only time the sailing competitions took place in freshwater.\nDuring the fifth race of the 1988 Summer Olympic sailing Finn event near Busan, Canada's Lawrence Lemieux was in second place when he noticed Joseph Chan of Singapore in the water from his capsized boat. Lemieux abandoned his position and rescued Chan and Chan's Singapore teammate. Even though Lemieux finished last in the race, the IOC gave him second place for the race as a result of Lemieux's heroic efforts. Lemieux would be awarded the IOC Pierre de Coubertin medal at the Finn medal awards ceremony by President Juan Antonio Samaranch.\nThe 1992 Summer Olympic venue was noted for its numerous complaints from the sailors over the debris found at the Olympic Harbor. Among the items found were dead rats and floating refrigerators. It was so bad that Barcelona port authorities, under pressure from the International Yacht Racing Union (later International Sailing Federation, now World Sailing since 2015), assigned four garbage vessels to collect garbage daily. In the men's windsurfer event, American Mike Gebhardt got a plastic bag caught on his boardsail in the last lap of the seventh race. Six boardsailers passed Gebhardt before he could dislodge the plastic bag. Gebhardt lost out a gold by 0.4 points over France's Franck David."

        "text": "NCAA independent lacrosse schools are four-year institutions in the United States that do not belong to a lacrosse-only conference or a primary all-sports conference that sponsors lacrosse. As of the 2023–24 academic year there are three men's and seven women's lacrosse programs in Division I, Division II, and Division III that compete as independents.\nDivision I.\nMen's.\nThe only team to play as an independent in the most recent 2023 season was Hartford, which began a transition from Division I to Division III in the 2021–22 school year. The 2022–23 school year, in which Hartford's entire athletic program (except men's and women's golf) was independent, was the last for Hartford in Division I, as it joined the D-III Commonwealth Coast Conference in July 2023.\nOne school is an independent in the 2024 season. Le Moyne started a transition from Division II to Division I in July 2023 as the newest member of the Northeast Conference (NEC), which sponsors all of Le Moyne's current sports except men's lacrosse. The 2024 season will be Le Moyne's only season as an independent; the NEC announced that it would reinstate men's lacrosse effective with the 2025 season.\nWomen's.\nFour schools competed as D-I independents in the 2023 season. As noted above, Hartford was a full independent in its final D-I season before moving to D-III in July 2023. San Diego State and UC Davis became independents after the 2021 season, when their former women's lacrosse home of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation shut down its league due to a lack of sponsoring members. Both joined Pac-12 Conference women's lacrosse after the 2023 season. Xavier played its inaugural women's lacrosse season as an independent before starting play in its full-time home of the Big East Conference in 2024.\nNo programs will compete as independents in the 2024 season. After the 2023 season, two programs that had been full members of conferences that sponsor women's lacrosse moved to conferences that do not sponsor the sport. Cincinnati left the American Athletic Conference for the Big 12 Conference, and Liberty left the ASUN Conference for Conference USA. Both schools kept their women's lacrosse programs in their former full-time conferences."
