After serving in the war, Gilchrist resumed his career. Gilchrist had a good serve and powerful forehand, but a weak backhand, though he worked hard to improve it. Gilchrist won several tournaments, but at the Australian championships he often lost to Bromwich or Quist, the two best Australian players of that era. Gilchrist made his Grand Slam debut at 1936 Australian championships and lost in round two to Adrian Quist. In 1938 he lost in round two to John Bromwich. In 1939 he reached the quarter-finals and lost to Jack Crawford in five sets. At the Australian championships in 1940, Gilchrist beat Jack Cummings before losing to Quist in round two. In 1947 he lost in round two of the Australian championships to Bromwich. In 1951 he lost in the second round to Quist."

        "title": "2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal",
        "text": "The 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal was a corruption scandal, initially involving sportswear manufacturer Adidas as well as several college basketball programs associated with the brand but now involving many programs not affiliated with Adidas.\nOn September 27, 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the office of the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced the arrest of 10 individuals, including assistant coaches Anthony Bland, Chuck Person, Emanuel Richardson, and Lamont Evans and Adidas executive James Gatto, on various corruption and fraud charges including bribery, money laundering, and wire fraud. The schools implicated in the initial announcement were Arizona, Auburn, Louisville, Miami, Oklahoma State, South Carolina, and Southern California (USC). Richardson had a six-figure salary. However, he was going broke due to him allegedly paying players out of pocket.\nThe investigation has since spread beyond the individuals and teams initially implicated. Shortly afterwards, multiple media reports indicated that the Elite Youth Basketball League, the grassroots basketball division of Nike, was served with a subpoena by federal investigators. While Nike was not named in the initial documents, one of the 10 individuals arrested on September 26 was a former Nike executive who was working for Adidas when he was arrested.\nOn February 23, 2018, Yahoo! Sports published a report, based on \"hundreds of pages of documents\" obtained by the FBI from two agents and an agency implicated in the investigation, that named more than a dozen additional schools and over 25 current and former players as having been potentially implicated in the scandal. Still later, on April 10, Southern District prosecutors added extra criminal counts to the indictment of Gatto, with the added counts specifically naming Kansas and North Carolina State as well as Louisville and Miami.\nBackground.\nThe discovery of corruption in basketball stemmed from an investigation of Pittsburgh-based financial planner Marty Blazer by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In 2016, the SEC charged Blazer with wire fraud and accused him of embezzling over $2 million from several professional athletes to invest in movie projects and finance Ponzi schemes. As part of a plea agreement with the Southern District U.S. Attorney's office, he agreed to become an FBI informant, and would later plead guilty to reduced charges. He has since stated that there were also payments made to players in efforts to attend the Penn State football program.\nPrograms affected.\nFirst wave.\nArizona.\nEmanuel \"Book\" Richardson, an Arizona assistant since 2009, was among the individuals arrested and indicted in 2017. He was alleged to have met with agent Christian Dawkins and others in June 2017, agreeing to accept a $5,000 bribe to steer Arizona players to Dawkins' sports management company, and he was also charged with accepting an additional $15,000 in bribes and paying at least one recruit to commit to the university. Richardson was suspended on September 26, the day after his arrest, and formally fired on January 23, 2018.\nArizona lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class in the wake of the initial allegations. Five-star point guard Jahvon Quinerly reopened his recruitment in October and eventually signed with Villanova. Nassir Little, also a five-star recruit, cited the investigation as his reason for deciding against attending Arizona. On a wiretap that was played during the trial, Merl Code claims that Arizona offered $150,000 for Little.\nAuburn.\nChuck Person, a former Auburn basketball star who went on to a long National Basketball Association career before going into coaching, was alleged by the FBI to have received over $90,000 in bribes from Rashan Michel, a former NBA and Southeastern Conference referee who ran a custom tailoring shop in Atlanta that had many professional athletes as clients. Person was accused of paying nearly $20,000 to the families of two active Auburn players. Auburn suspended Person without pay shortly after his arrest. Person was indicted by a federal grand jury and subsequently fired by Auburn on November 7, 2017. In the wake of the indictments, the university retained an outside law firm to launch an internal investigation into the program.\nBefore Auburn's exhibition game on November 2, 2017, the school announced that it would hold players Austin Wiley and Danjel Purifoy out of games indefinitely due to eligibility concerns raised over the FBI investigation. They would both be held out of action throughout the rest of the season, though they returned to play after the conclusion of that season.\nOn November 8, ESPN reported that head coach Bruce Pearl refused to cooperate with the school's internal investigation, and that university officials notified him that the refusal could lead to his firing. The university had been unable to determine whether Pearl had been involved in any violations of law or NCAA rules because the FBI had seized his computers and cell phones as part of its investigation.\nOn the same day that the initial arrests were announced, E. J. Montgomery, a highly touted forward in the 2018 recruiting class who had verbally committed to Auburn in September 2016, announced he would reopen his recruitment. Montgomery ultimately committed to Kentucky in April 2018.\nLouisville.\nLouisville was not named directly in the court documents, but the documents mentioned a \"University-6\" that was \"a public research university located in Kentucky\" with \"approximately 22,640 students and over 7,000 faculty and staff members\", and fielding \"approximately 21 varsity sports teams in NCAA Division I competition.\" The state has only two public research universities—the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville—and the details cited in the documents match only Louisville. Gregory Postel, Louisville's interim president, confirmed hours after the FBI announcements that the school was indeed \"University-6\". At the time of the announcement, the Louisville men's basketball program was facing major NCAA sanctions stemming from an earlier sex scandal, which included vacating the 2013 national championship. The NCAA upheld those sanctions on February 20, 2018.\nThe documents also alluded to two Louisville coaches, identified only as \"Coach-1\" and \"Coach-2\", and a recruit who signed with Louisville identified as \"Player-10\". The documents allege that the coaches were involved in a scheme by which a \"Company-1\", later identified as Adidas, would funnel $100,000 to the family of \"Player-10\" in exchange for him coming to Louisville. About a month before the scandal broke, Louisville, which has been Adidas' flagship college athletic program since 2016, signed a 10-year, $160 million extension to its then-current apparel contract with the company. The documents indicate that Brad Augustine, a youth basketball coach in Florida who was among the individuals arrested, said the following about \"Coach-2\":No one swings a bigger dick than Coach-2 at Company-1. . . . All [Coach-2] has to do is pick up the phone and call somebody [and say], 'These are my guys.' [And then] they're taking care of us. The day after the complaints were unsealed, CBS News, followed by many other media outlets, reported that \"Coach-2\" was Louisville head coach Rick Pitino. Shortly thereafter, media outlets identified \"Player-10\" as Brian Bowen, a top recruit who had unexpectedly signed with Louisville on June 3, 2017. Bowen most recently played for the Indiana Pacers on a two-way contract.\nAs a result of the scandal, on September 27, 2017, Louisville placed Pitino on unpaid administrative leave and athletic director Tom Jurich on paid administrative leave. Bowen was suspended from the team and withheld from all team activities. In addition, two five-star high school recruits who had verbally committed to join the Louisville program in 2018–19, Anfernee Simons and Courtney Ramey, rescinded their commitments and reopened their recruitment. Simons would try his luck with entering the 2018 NBA draft as a high school postgraduate. The Cardinals lost a third recruit on October 4 when David Johnson, a guard from the local Trinity High School who was rated as a top-50 prospect in the recruiting class of 2019 and had verbally committed to Louisville, rescinded his commitment (Johnson would re-commit to Louisville a year later). Two other five-star prospects for 2018 who had placed Louisville within their final choices, Moses Brown and Romeo Langford removed the Cardinals from their lists in the wake of the scandal.\nOn October 6 the University of Louisville placed associate head coach Kenny Johnson and assistant coach Jordan Fair on paid administrative leave, and Fair would be fired by Louisville on October 11.\nThe Louisville athletics board officially voted to fire Pitino on October 16. Two days later, the university's board of trustees voted 10–3 to fire Jurich with cause.\nOn November 8, the Southern District unsealed a new set of indictments against eight of the 10 individuals initially charged. On the same day, NBC News reported that these new documents directly linked Pitino to the alleged scheme to pay Bowen's family. The documents allege that Pitino met in July 2017 with Christian Dawkins, an agent who was formally indicted in both September and November. During that meeting, Dawkins was said to have asked Pitino to call Gatto and request the $100,000 payment to Bowen's family, and Pitino reportedly agreed to make the call to Gatto. The FBI revealed that phone records indicated that Pitino called Gatto three times before Bowen committed to Louisville.\nThe April 2018 indictments specifically charge Dawkins and Adidas consultant Merl Code with conspiring with Gatto to commit wire fraud and pay the aforementioned $100,000 to Bowen's family.\nOn May 18, 2018, the board of trustees agreed to a $4.5 million settlement with Jurich that cleared him of any wrongdoing and phrased his termination as \"retirement\".\nMiami.\nLike Louisville, the University of Miami was not directly identified in the court documents, but UM president Julio Frenk confirmed on September 27 that the school was the institution described in said documents as \"University-7\". The confirmation came the day after the attorney for UM head coach Jim Larrañaga said that the coach was unaware of any impropriety in the program. The documents allege that a UM coach identified only as \"Coach-3\" requested that Gatto arrange a $150,000 payment from Adidas to the family of a top high school player identified as \"Player-12\" in an attempt to keep him from signing with a \"University-4\" that was sponsored by a rival apparel company. This alleged $150,000 payment was also included in the April 2018 indictments.\nOklahoma State and South Carolina.\nLamont Evans, at the time an assistant at Oklahoma State, was one of the four coaches arrested on September 26. He was accused of taking at least $22,000 in bribes from two financial advisors, one of whom was acting as an FBI informant. The alleged bribes were offered over a five-year period that included Evans' former tenure as an assistant at South Carolina. Oklahoma State fired Evans on September 28.\nOklahoma State lost one potential recruit due to the scandal. On the same day Evans was fired, Antwann Jones, a guard ranked by ESPN as one of the top 50 players in the recruiting class of 2018, rescinded a verbal commitment he had made to the program less than two weeks earlier.\nEvans was sentenced to three months in prison in June 2019 for his participation in the scheme, which he also conducted at the University of South Carolina.\nIn June 2020, a press release by the NCAA announced that the men’s basketball team will be prohibited from participating in 2020-21 postseason competition and the university will self-impose a fine of $10,000 plus 1 percent of the men’s basketball program’s budget.\nAlabama.\nIn the aftermath of the announcement of the FBI investigation, Alabama director of basketball operations Kobie Baker resigned following an internal investigation into the program. This resignation came after the school uncovered that Baker had accepted bribes to steer one of Alabama's incoming freshman players toward financial advisor Rashan Michel. Baker allegedly accepted a $5,000 payment for arranging a meeting between Michel and the father of the player, and an additional $10,000 for helping to steer the player toward Michel.\nBefore Alabama's exhibition game on November 6, 2017, the school announced that freshman point guard Collin Sexton would not play that game nor the first regular season game against Memphis due to eligibility concerns. Sexton would later be cleared to play for Alabama starting with their November 14 game against Lipscomb.\nUSC.\nOn September 26, federal prosecutors in New York announced charges of fraud and corruption against USC assistant coach Tony Bland. The charges allege that Bland and others allegedly received benefits from financial advisers and others to influence student-athletes to retain their services. Following the announcement, USC placed Bland on administrative leave and announced that it would conduct an internal investigation of the matter. After playing in only a few games in the 2017–18 season, on January 15, 2018, sophomore point guard De'Anthony Melton was indefinitely suspended as a result of the investigation. Melton would later remove himself from the university on February 21, 2018, in order to enter the 2018 NBA draft and begin training for it early, where he was selected 46th by the Houston Rockets and was later traded to the Phoenix Suns on August 31 before the upcoming NBA season began.\nOn Friday, December 13, 2019, USC received a notice of allegations from the NCAA in regards to the violations stemming from this investigation into the USC basketball department.\nIn April 2021, the USC men's basketball program was put on probation for two years and fined $5,000, plus one percent of the program's budget.\nSecond wave.\nArizona.\nOn February 23, 2018, FBI wiretaps reportedly showed that head coach Sean Miller had discussed with Dawkins about paying Deandre Ayton $100,000 to facilitate Ayton's commitment to the University of Arizona, with the monetary situation being dealt with directly to him. 247Sports, which follows high school players and their recruitment, had predicted 99% that Ayton would be attending University of Kansas the night of his commitment. If he were implicated in this case, it would have potentially hurt Ayton's chances of finishing out the rest of his season with Arizona, as well as result in him entering the 2018 NBA draft earlier than anticipated, similar to that of De'Anthony Melton. The following day, Miller notified the team that he would not coach in that night's game against Oregon, with associate coach Lorenzo Romar coaching the team instead and Ayton being allowed to play for Arizona that game. However, Ayton and his family have maintained they did not earn any monetary benefits to attend Arizona, with further information suggesting that Miller's calls to Dawkins were related to the recruitment of another player instead. This ultimately led to Ayton being cleared to finish out the season with Arizona. On March 1, Miller made his first public comments since the reporting on the wiretaps, in which he unequivocally denied any involvement in payments to players. ESPN reported that Miller would coach the team that night against Stanford, with Miller confirmed to remain the coach for Arizona throughout the rest of this season, as well as a bit further beyond that. (In part because of the continued corruption investigation, Miller would eventually be fired by Arizona in April 2021.)\nArizona, which had already lost one of its three-member 2018 recruiting class after the initial allegations, initially lost its remaining two 2018 recruits after the new revelations. Power forward Shareef O'Neal, son of Hall of Fame player Shaquille O'Neal and rated as a top-30 prospect, announced on February 24 that he was rescinding a commitment he had made in April 2017 to play at Arizona. Because the younger O'Neal signed a nonbinding financial aid agreement instead of a formal letter of intent, he did not need a release from Arizona to choose a new destination, and he would commit to UCLA three days later. Arizona's only remaining recruit at the time in the 2018 class, point guard Brandon Williams, also did not sign a letter of intent, giving him the option to reopen his recruitment, and he chose to do so on March 2. However, unlike Shareef O'Neal, Williams decided to recommit to Arizona on May 5, 2018.\nNC State.\nAccording to the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports, former NC State and current NBA player Dennis Smith Jr. had received $43,500 from ASM Sports, an agency run by reported cooperating government witness Andy Miller, before enrolling at the school. Another document said that Smith had received over $70,000 in loans, with the document also including notes about \"how to recoup the money\" after Smith chose not to sign with ASM Sports.\nThe April 2018 indictments specifically charge that Gatto was involved in a scheme to funnel $40,000 to Smith's family in October 2015 in exchange for signing with NC State. Adidas had a well-established relationship with both Smith and NC State, as Smith was playing for an Adidas-sponsored AAU team at the time, and NC State was then (as now) an Adidas-backed program. The indictment also claimed that an NC State coach identified only as \"Coach-4\" was the conduit for this payment. Smith would sign a financial aid agreement with the school in December of that year.\nSeton Hall.\nThe ASM documents also claim that current NBA player Isaiah Whitehead received at least $26,000 from ASM while at Seton Hall. He signed with ASM after leaving for the 2016 NBA draft, but later moved to Roc Nation.\nLSU.\nFormer LSU player Tim Quarterman allegedly received at least $16,000 from ASM while at the school.\nMaryland.\nDiamond Stone, who played at Maryland in the 2015–16 season, allegedly received over $14,000 from ASM. The school launched an internal investigation into possible ties with the scandal, with head coach Mark Turgeon denying that he or any of his staff members had any involvement with the agency.\nThe April 2018 indictments peripherally linked Maryland and its current apparel provider, Under Armour, to the scandal in a completely separate context, although neither was explicitly named in those documents. The FBI alleged that Gatto and a co-conspirator identified in the documents as \"CC-3\" agreed to make payments to the guardian of a 2017 recruit who was identified by media as Silvio De Sousa. According to the documents, the guardian told \"CC-3\" that he had received illicit payments from individuals connected with Under Armour in exchange for De Sousa's commitment to Maryland. The guardian also indicated that De Sousa preferred to go to Kansas, but that he would need to repay the illicit payments to facilitate the player's wishes. Gatto and \"CC-3\" then allegedly paid the guardian $20,000. De Sousa, who had been considered by most recruiting experts as a virtual lock to attend Maryland, committed to Kansas on August 30, 2017. It should also be noted that shortly after the 2018 indictments were unsealed, De Sousa's guardian denied accepting any illicit payments.\nKentucky.\nA spreadsheet in the documents viewed by Yahoo! Sports listed a $12,000 payment to a prospect identified as \"BAM\". A later note in the document identifies this individual as Bam Adebayo, who played only one season at Kentucky in 2016–17. Other documents claim that Adebayo received $36,500 in loans. Additionally, then-current Wildcats player Kevin Knox II was listed among several players who had met or dined with Dawkins, or whose families had done so.\nWashington.\nMarkelle Fultz, who played a season at Washington before leaving to become the top pick in the 2017 NBA draft, allegedly received $10,000 from ASM.\nUSC.\nMelton would ultimately not be the only USC player implicated. The ASM documents claim that two other current USC players, or individuals closely associated with them, had received payments from the company.\nUtah.\nKyle Kuzma, a 2017 first-round NBA draft pick, was listed in the ASM documents as having received $9,500 from the agency while at Utah.\nXavier.\nFormer Xavier star Edmond Sumner and his father reportedly received at least $7,000 in advances from ASM during the younger Sumner's college career.\nSouth Carolina.\nAfter being withheld from play by Louisville amid questions regarding his eligibility stemming from the original revelations, Brian Bowen withdrew from the school and eventually enrolled at South Carolina, though he would not be eligible to play for the Gamecocks' basketball program until January 2019. However, the ASM documents raise more questions about his NCAA eligibility, allegedly listing at least $7,000 in benefits to him and his family during his high school career. That would result in him later rescinding his collegiate entry altogether, instead opting to begin a professional basketball career early, starting with the Sydney Kings in Australia. In addition, PJ Dozier, a star on South Carolina's 2017 Final Four team, was alleged to have received over $6,000 while at the school.\nKansas.\nThe mother of former Kansas (KU) star Josh Jackson, Apples Jones, reportedly received $2,700 from ASM during Jackson's college career.\nThe April 2018 indictments raised more serious issues surrounding the Kansas program, which is also sponsored by Adidas. Gatto and the coach of an Adidas-sponsored AAU team were alleged to have given at least $90,000 to the mother of a KU recruit between October 2016 and November 2017 in exchange for the player's commitment to the school. Sources close to the investigation told Yahoo! Sports that this player was Billy Preston, who committed to KU in November 2016 and enrolled at the school in 2017. He played in two exhibition games, but the school did not allow him to play during the beginning 2017–18 season and then left school after questions were raised about his ownership of a car he was driving at the time of an auto accident. Another member of KU's 2017 recruiting class, Silvio De Sousa, was linked to illicit payments in the 2018 indictments. The university attempted a plea deal acknowledging the payment to De Sousa was used to cover an online class. In April 2019, the university submitted their formal appeal to have De Sousa be re-instated for the 2019–2020 season.\nTexas.\nThen-current Texas player Eric Davis Jr. allegedly received $1,500 from ASM. Texas held him out of the team's February 24 game against Oklahoma State. In addition, former Longhorns player Prince Ibeh was found in Dawkins' list of players and/or families who had met with or dined with Dawkins while in high school or college.\nSan Diego State.\nThen-current San Diego State player Malik Pope allegedly received $1,400 from ASM. Pope was withheld from the team's February 24 game against San Jose State while the school launched an internal investigation into the allegations. San Diego State cleared Pope to play prior to the Aztecs' February 27 game against Boise State, determining that there was no credible evidence that Pope had received any impermissible benefits.\nClemson.\nFormer Clemson star Jaron Blossomgame reportedly received a payment of $1,100 while at the school.\nWichita State.\nThe ASM documents allege that former Wichita State star Fred VanVleet received at least $1,000 while playing for the school.\nMichigan State.\nThe mother of then-current Michigan State star Miles Bridges reportedly received several hundred dollars in advances from ASM. An internal Michigan State investigation found that allegations that Bridges' mother had received about $400 in cash from Dawkins were false, but confirmed that Dawkins had paid slightly over $70 for a dinner with Bridges family members (though without the player present). Bridges was temporarily ruled ineligible because of the dinner, but his eligibility was restored on February 24, just in time to play for the Spartans' regular season finale at Wisconsin. Bridges made a $40 contribution (the approximate value of his family members' meals at the Dawkins meeting) to a charity of his choice as part of the reinstatement process.\nOther players potentially implicated.\nThe ASM documents also indicated that several players, or their family members, had either met or dined with Dawkins while the players were in high school or college. According to a lawyer involved with NCAA compliance issues who was interviewed in the Yahoo! Sports report, merely meeting with an agent is not an NCAA violation, but if the agent pays for a player's or family member's meal, the meal can be considered an \"extra benefit\" under NCAA rules. In addition to the aforementioned Knox and Ibeh, the following then-current and former NCAA players were listed in the ASM documents in this context:\nDocumentary.\nOn March 31, 2020, a documentary based on the scandal, titled \"The Scheme\", was released by HBO. The film received positive reviews from critics."

        "title": "List of defunct and relocated Major League Baseball teams",
        "text": "Throughout the history of Major League Baseball, numerous franchises have moved or become defunct. Many of these franchises played in the National League (NL) and the American League (AL), the two existing major leagues, but other franchises played in one of the eleven major leagues that ultimately went defunct. The classification of the major leagues is based on Major League Baseball's recognition of historical leagues.\nMajor league baseball emerged in the 1870s, and four major leagues, including the NL, played at least one season of baseball in the nineteenth century. During this period, dozens of franchises were founded, but most went defunct, leaving just twelve NL franchises by the 1892 season. After four of the twelve NL franchises went defunct following the 1899 season, the American League emerged in 1901 with several newly founded franchises. The Federal League (FL) challenged the primacy of the American League and the National League for two seasons, but the FL and all of its franchises went defunct after the 1915 season. Numerous Negro leagues operated during the first half of the twentieth century; seven leagues that operated from 1920 to 1948 were later recognized as major leagues by Major League Baseball.\nOutside of the Negro leagues, no major league franchises moved until the Boston Braves moved to Milwaukee following the 1952 season. Several teams moved over the next twenty years, often to the Western or Southern United States. The Montreal Expos became the Washington Nationals in 2005, the first move in three decades.\nIn 2025, the Oakland Athletics plan to temporarily move to West Sacramento, California, and brand themselves as simply the \"A's\" and \"Athletics\" with no city name attached, until they permanently move to Las Vegas in 2028 or later when their new ballpark is completed.\nList of defunct and relocated major league franchises since 1892.\nNational, American, and Federal League franchises.\nThese franchises played in the National League, the American League, or the Federal League after the 1891 season and either went defunct or moved. Some franchises appear more than once in the table; for example, the Braves franchise appears twice because they moved to Milwaukee in 1952 and to Atlanta in 1965.\nNegro major league franchises.\nIn 2020, Major League Baseball extended major league recognition to seven Negro leagues:\nThe listed years in the table below indicate the first and last years that the franchise played in a major league as recognized by Major League Baseball; many franchises existed before or after playing in a major league. Franchises that played only as associate clubs of a major league are not included. From 1924 to 1927, and from 1942 to 1948, the top Negro leagues crowned a champion through the Negro World Series.\nList of major league franchises that went defunct prior to 1892.\nThe franchises in the following list went defunct before the 1892 season, and played in the National League, the American Association (AA), the Players' League (PL), the Union Association (UA), or some combination of the four leagues. The NL has played continuously since 1876, the AA existed from 1882 to 1891, the UA existed for one season in 1884, and the PL operated for one season in 1890. Note that there have been many cases of multiple distinct franchises sharing the same name.\nIn 1968–1969, the Special Records Committee, which was established by Major League Baseball, defined the major leagues as consisting of the NA, NL, AA, PL, UA, American League, and Federal League. The Special Records Committee excluded the National Association (NA), which operated from 1871 to 1875, as a major league. Some baseball writers have nonetheless argued that the NA should be considered the first major league, but NA franchises are not included below unless they later played in the National League.\n†Indicates a franchise that played in the National Association prior to joining the National League\nTimelines.\nFranchise and league timeline.\nThis timeline includes all franchises (including non-defunct franchises) that played in the AL or NL after 1891; it also shows the eleven historical leagues during the period in which each is considered a major league by Major League Baseball. Only major and recent name changes are marked in blue. Franchise moves are marked in black.\nPre-1900 city timeline.\nThis timeline shows the history of major league franchises (including non-defunct franchises) before 1900. Multiple bars for a city indicates that the city hosted multiple major league franchises at the same time; for example, Philadelphia at times hosted two or three franchises concurrently. Gaps in the bars indicate a change in franchises; for example, there were three franchises known as the Kansas City Cowboys. Franchise moves are not tracked by this timeline."

        "title": "2018 FIFA World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2018 FIFA World Cup final was the final match of the 2018 World Cup, the 21st edition of FIFA's competition for national football teams. The match was played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, Russia, on 15 July 2018, and was contested by France and Croatia. The tournament comprised hosts Russia and 31 other teams who emerged from the qualification phase, organised by the six FIFA confederations. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for the knockout stage. En route to the final, France finished first in Group C, with two wins and a draw, after which they defeated Argentina in the round of 16, Uruguay in the quarter-final and Belgium in the semi-final. Croatia finished first in Group D with three wins, before defeating Denmark in the round of 16 and Russia in the quarter-final – both through a penalty shoot-out – and then England in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 78,011 supporters, with more than 1.1 billion watching on television, and was refereed by Néstor Pitana from Argentina.\nFrance took the lead through a controversial free kick that led to an own goal by Mario Mandžukić in the 18th minute – the first ever own goal in a World Cup final – before Ivan Perišić equalised 10 minutes later with a low shot into the corner of the goal. Shortly afterwards, France were awarded a penalty when Pitana ruled that Perišić had deliberately handled the ball. The decision resulted from a consultation with the video assistant referee, which was in use for the first time in a World Cup at the 2018 tournament. The decision was criticised by some pundits such as Alan Shearer, who labelled it \"ridiculous\", while others such as Chris Waddle thought it was correct. Antoine Griezmann scored to give France a 2–1 half-time lead. They extended that lead in the 59th minute, when Paul Pogba scored at the second attempt after Croatia goalkeeper Danijel Subašić had saved his initial shot. Kylian Mbappé scored from outside the penalty area to make it 4–1, becoming only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final after Pelé in 1958, before Mandžukić capitalized on a Hugo Lloris error to score a second for Croatia, giving a final score of 4–2 to France.\nFrance's win was their second World Cup title, following their victory in 1998, which they hosted. Griezmann was named the man of the match, while Croatia's Luka Modrić was awarded the Golden Ball as FIFA's outstanding player of the tournament. The final was the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966. France's manager, Didier Deschamps, reflected on his own experience as captain of the 1998 French team, saying \"that adventure is linked to these players' adventure. I had the immense privilege to live through this 20 years ago, and in France, but what the players have just done is just as beautiful, just as powerful.\" His Croatian counterpart, Zlatko Dalić, congratulated France on their win, but was critical of the penalty decision, saying \"you don’t give a penalty like that in a World Cup final\". At the subsequent UEFA Euro 2020 tournament, held in 2021, both France and Croatia reached the round of 16, before being eliminated by Switzerland and Spain respectively.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup final was the first (and as of 2022, the most recent) final since 2002 not to go into extra time or penalties.\nBackground.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st edition of the World Cup, FIFA's football competition for national teams, held in Russia between 14 June and 15 July 2018. Russia qualified for the finals automatically as tournament hosts, while 208 teams competed for the remaining 31 spots through qualifying rounds organised by the six FIFA confederations and held between June 2015 and November 2017. In the finals, the teams were divided into eight groups of four with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The two top teams from each group advanced to a knock-out phase. The defending champions from the 2014 World Cup were Germany. They were eliminated in the group phase at the 2018 event, however, finishing bottom of their group behind Sweden, Mexico and South Korea.\nFrance had won the World Cup once before, beating Brazil in the 1998 final. They had also finished in second place once before, losing to Italy in the 2006 final. The team had reached the quarter-final of the previous World Cup, and then finished as runners-up to Portugal at Euro 2016, a tournament hosted in France. The 2018 final was the first for Croatia in their fifth World Cup appearance. They became the tenth European country and thirteenth overall to reach a World Cup final. Their previous best performance was at the 1998 World Cup, where they reached the semi-final before losing to France. Croatia had been eliminated in the group stage at the 2014 tournament, before reaching the round of 16 at Euro 2016, where they lost to eventual-winners Portugal. The final was the sixth meeting between the two teams, with France undefeated in the previous fixtures with three wins and two draws. Croatia's team at the time was described by many pundits as a golden generation, with Luka Modrić, Ivan Rakitić and Mario Mandžukić as the key players, although with many members of the team having passed the age of thirty, the 2018 World Cup was described as \"surely a last quest towards making an impact on the greatest stage\" by \"The Guardian\" Shaun Walker. The final was the ninth all-European World Cup final, the most recent having been in 2010 when Spain won 1–0 against the Netherlands.\nThe official match ball for the final was the Telstar Mechta (; dream or ambition), a red-coloured variant of the Adidas Telstar 18 introduced for the knockout stage. The Telstar family, a homage to the original 1970 Telstar, was designed similarly to 2014's Brazuca, but with longer seams and additional panels.\nVenue.\nThe final was played at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, located in the Khamovniki District of the Central Administrative Okrug. An expanded version of the stadium was named as the provisional final venue in Russia's World Cup bid, which was selected by FIFA on 2 December 2010. Luzhniki Stadium was confirmed as the final venue on 14 December 2012, following a meeting of the FIFA Executive Committee held in Tokyo, Japan. The stadium also hosted six other matches, including the opening match on 14 June, three group stage matches, a round of 16 match, and the second semi-final match.\nThe Luzhniki Stadium, previously known as the Grand Arena of the Central Lenin Stadium until 1992, originally opened in 1956 as part of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex to host the USSR Summer Spartakiade. It served as the national stadium of the country, hosting many matches for the Russia national team and its predecessor, the Soviet Union national team. In the past, it was the home ground at various times for CSKA Moscow, Torpedo Moscow, and Spartak Moscow. However, , there are currently no clubs based at the stadium.\nRated as a category 4 stadium by UEFA, the Luzhniki Stadium was the largest at the 2018 World Cup; it usually had a maximum capacity of 81,006, but was reduced to 78,011 for the World Cup. This also makes the stadium the largest in Eastern Europe, and among the largest in Europe. To prepare for the World Cup, the stadium was closed for extensive renovations in August 2013. The spectator stands were moved closer to the pitch, which was converted from artificial turf to natural grass, after the removal of the athletic track. The historic facade of the stadium was preserved due to its architectural value, while the roof was upgraded using a new polycarbonate skin with exterior lighting. The Luzhniki did not host any matches at the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup due to the ongoing project. The renovation project cost €341 million, and the stadium officially reopened with an international friendly between Russia and Argentina on 11 November 2017.\nRoute to the final.\nFrance.\nFrance entered the 2018 World Cup as the bookmakers' favourites to win the tournament, and qualified for the tournament by finishing first in their qualification group, ahead of Sweden and the Netherlands. In the finals, they were drawn in Group C alongside Australia, Denmark, and Peru. Their opening match was against Australia at Kazan Arena in Kazan on 16 June. France won the game 2–1 with Antoine Griezmann scoring the first goal from a penalty called by the video assistant referee. This was followed by a penalty for Australia which was scored by Mile Jedinak, before France scored the winner through an own goal deflected in by Australian defender Aziz Behich. France's second match was against Peru at Central Stadium in Yekaterinburg. France won 1–0 through a goal scored by 19-year-old Kylian Mbappé, who became the country's youngest goalscorer at a major tournament. The victory qualified France for the knockout stage, allowing Didier Deschamps, the French manager, to rest several starting players for the final group stage match against Denmark. That game, which took place at the Luzhniki Stadium, finished in a scoreless draw and was enough for France to win the group.\nIn the round of 16, France faced Group D runners-up Argentina, on 30 June at Kazan Stadium. In a match dubbed by writers for \"The Week\" as \"the classic of Kazan\", France won 4–3. Griezmann gave France the lead early in the game with a penalty, after Marcos Rojo had fouled Mbappé as he ran with the ball into the penalty area. Argentina then scored on either side of half-time through Ángel Di María and Gabriel Mercado to take the lead, but Benjamin Pavard brought France level again. Mbappé then scored twice in five minutes to put them 4–2 up before Sergio Agüero scored a late third for Argentina. Patrick Jennings of BBC Sport described Mbappé's contribution as a \"brilliant performance that will linger long in the memory\". France's quarter-final was against Uruguay at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium on 6 July. They won 2–0, with goals from Raphaël Varane and Griezmann. The team advanced to a semi-final match against Belgium at the Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg on 10 July. The game ended in a 1–0 win for the French, the winner headed into the goal by defender Samuel Umtiti following a corner kick.\nCroatia.\nIn their qualification group, Croatia finished second to Iceland and had to enter the qualifying play-offs. There, they faced Greece, whom they beat over a two-legged tie, winning the first leg 4–1 and drawing 0–0 in the second. In the finals, Croatia were drawn into Group D with Argentina, Iceland, and Nigeria, considered a difficult draw due to Argentina's talent and Nigeria's historic performances. In their opening match, the team earned a 2–0 victory over Nigeria, with an own goal by Oghenekaro Etebo caused by Mario Mandžukić and a penalty scored by Luka Modrić. Striker Nikola Kalinić refused to enter the match as a substitute, citing back pain as his reason for not playing, and was expelled from the team by manager Zlatko Dalić, leaving Croatia with only 22 players for the remainder of the tournament. Croatia went on to beat Argentina 3–0, taking the lead in the second half when goalkeeper Willy Caballero's attempted clearance was intercepted by Ante Rebić, and then scoring twice more through Modrić and Ivan Rakitić. Lionel Messi, Argentina's captain, was described by BBC Sport's Jennings as \"adrift for much of the match\". Croatia finished atop the group with a 2–1 win over Iceland, resting several starting players in the final group match.\nIn the round of 16, Croatia played Denmark on 1 July at Nizhny Novgorod Stadium. They earned a 1–1 draw after the two teams exchanged goals in the opening five minutes and Modrić missed a penalty in extra time. Croatia won the subsequent penalty shootout 3–2, with three saves by goalkeeper Danijel Subašić and two saves by Danish goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. The team advanced to a quarter-final at Fisht Olympic Stadium in Sochi against hosts Russia, on 7 July. The Russians scored their first in the 31st minute, but Andrej Kramarić equalised for Croatia eight minutes later and kept the score at 1–1 through the end of regular time. Croatia took a 2–1 lead in the 101st minute with a header by Domagoj Vida, but Russian defender Mário Fernandes equalised five minutes before the end of extra time to trigger a penalty shoot-out. The shootout was won 4–3 by Croatia after two misses by Russia and a shot by Modrić that rebounded into the goal off Igor Akinfeev's arm and the post. Croatia became the second team in World Cup to win two shoot-outs in a tournament, after Argentina in 1990. After the match, a video of Vida shouting \"Glory to Ukraine\" prompted controversy among Russians and a warning from FIFA's disciplinary committee, which enforces a ban on political slogans. Croatia's semi-final match against England, on 11 July at the Luzhniki, began as they conceded a free kick goal by English defender Kieran Trippier in the fifth minute. Croatia resisted several attempts by England to score a second goal in the first half. Croatia managed an equalising goal of their own through a shot by Ivan Perišić in the 68th minute. The match was won 2–1 by Croatia after a 109th-minute goal by Mandžukić. This made Croatia the first team to earn three come-from-behind victories in the FIFA World Cup, all three matches also going into extra time.\nPre-match.\nArgentine referee Néstor Pitana was selected to lead the officiating team for the final, which was announced on 12 July 2018 by the FIFA Referees Committee. The final was Pitana's fifth match as referee during the tournament, becoming only the second referee to officiate the opening match and the final. Pitana officiated an additional group stage match, along with two knockout stage matches in the round of 16 and quarter-finals. Pitana had been a FIFA referee since 2010, and officiated four matches at the 2014 World Cup. His compatriots Hernán Maidana and Juan Pablo Belatti were chosen as assistant referees. Björn Kuipers of the Netherlands was chosen as the fourth official, with his fellow countryman Erwin Zeinstra as the reserve assistant. Italian Massimiliano Irrati was named the video assistant referee, presiding over the first use of the technology at a World Cup final. Argentine Mauro Vigliano was chosen as the assistant video assistant referee, while Carlos Astroza of Chile was appointed as the second assistant and Danny Makkelie of the Netherlands as the third assistant.\nThe tournament's closing ceremony was held prior to the start of the match, featuring a performance of \"Live It Up\", the official song of the tournament, by Will Smith, Nicky Jam, and Era Istrefi. Jam also performed \"X (Equis)\", wearing a shirt honouring J Balvin. Opera singer Aida Garifullina sang the Russian folk song \"Kalinka\", accompanied by a children's choir and percussion section that featured a cameo by former Brazilian international Ronaldinho. There were ten heads of state in attendance, among them Russian president Vladimir Putin, French president Emmanuel Macron, and Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović.\nThe starting line-ups for both teams were identical to those fielded in the semi-finals. Deschamps chose a 4–4–2 formation while his opposite number Dalić opted for a 4–1–4–1 with Mandžukić as the lone striker.\nMatch.\nFirst half.\nCroatia kicked off the match at 6 pm local time (3 pm UTC) in temperatures of with 51% humidity, in front of a crowd of 78,011 and an estimated global television audience of 1.12 billion. The weather at Sheremetyevo International Airport, from the stadium, was recorded as partly cloudy at the time of kick-off. The match was played through a minor thunderstorm, which produced several visible lightning strikes. \"The Guardian\" Barry Glendenning wrote that Croatia had the better of the first 15 minutes, noting that France were \"struggling to get out of their own half\" and that Croatia were \"bossing them completely.\" However, it was France who took the lead in the 18th minute. They won a free kick around from goal when Marcelo Brozović fouled Griezmann, which Griezmann took himself. He crossed the free kick into the penalty area, where it reached Mandžukić. He attempted to head clear, but the ball instead went past goalkeeper Subašić for an own goal, the first ever own goal in a World Cup final. N'Golo Kanté received the game's first yellow card in the 28th minute for a foul on Perišić. Croatia equalised a minute later, when Perišić was fouled from goal and Modrić's free kick towards the far goalpost was headed back across goal by Šime Vrsaljko and collected by Perišić, who hit a low shot into the corner of the goal.\nThree minutes after Croatia's goal, Griezmann took a corner into the penalty area. Blaise Matuidi's attempt to score with a header was not successful, but France players appealed for a penalty, claiming that Perišić had handled the ball while marking Matuidi. The video assistant referee alerted Pitana and after he reviewed the incident for several minutes, he gave a penalty to France. The penalty was taken by Griezmann in the 38th minute, and he scored with a low kick into the left-hand corner. In the 43rd minute, Lucas Hernandez was booked for a foul on Rebić and then Perišić had a shot on goal which was deflected for a corner by Paul Pogba. Shortly before half-time, Croatia had a corner which was taken by Rakitić into the penalty area, where Vida had an opportunity to score with his head, but the ball went wide of the goal. The first half finished with France leading 2–1, despite having only one shot on goal and 34% of the possession. During the half-time break, pundits discussed the legitimacy of both France's goals, with Alan Shearer and Rio Ferdinand on BBC One saying that neither the free kick which led to their first goal, nor the penalty for the second, should have been awarded. Shearer labelled the penalty decision \"ridiculous\", saying that in his opinion there was \"no way that the hand-ball was deliberate\". Chris Waddle, speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live thought the penalty decision was correct, however, saying \"I would have given it. Perišić has stopped the ball going through with his hand.\" Gabriele Marcotti of ESPN described it as \"the sort of decision that, even after replay, could have gone either way\".\nSecond half.\nA Croatian attack was stopped early in the second half after several pitch invaders ran onto the field before being removed by security officers; Russian feminist rock band and protest group Pussy Riot claimed responsibility for the interruption. Three minutes into the second half, Croatia had an opportunity to score when Rebić struck the ball towards goal from the left side of the penalty area following a pass by Rakitić. French goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a one-handed save from his shot, sending the ball behind for a corner. Glendenning said that Croatia had begun the second half as they began the first, \"in a state of total dominance\". France had an opportunity in the 52nd minute, when Mbappé received the ball from Pogba and ran down the left-hand side. He ran past Vida and shot towards goal, but Subašić was able to claim the ball. France made a substitution in the 55th minute when Steven Nzonzi replaced Kanté. They then increased their lead in the 59th minute, when Pogba found Mbappé again, on the right wing, with a pass from his own half. Mbappé passed to Griezmann, who then sent the ball back to Pogba who was outside the penalty area. Pogba took a shot at goal which rebounded back to him off a defender, before he sent a second shot into the Croatian goal with Subašić unable to reach it.\nFrance had a chance to extend their lead in the 63rd minute when Olivier Giroud hit the ball with a bicycle kick towards Griezmann, who was not marked in front of goal, but Brozović was able to gain possession before the ball reached Griezmann. Two minutes later, they did score again when Mbappé hit a shot from which went past Vida and Subašić, low into the Croatian goal. Mbappé became only the second teenager to score in a World Cup final, the first being Pelé when he scored twice in 1958. Croatia scored their second goal in the 69th minute from a back-pass that Lloris failed to dribble away from Mandžukić, who poked the loose ball into the unguarded net with his right leg. Despite late pressure by Croatia, the match finished as a 4–2 victory for France, the highest-scoring World Cup final since 1966 and the first World Cup final since 2002 to be decided without extra time.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=final /&gt;&lt;section end=final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nFrance became the sixth country to win the World Cup more than once with their win. Deschamps became the third person to have won the World Cup as both a player and manager, after Mário Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer. The final was the highest scoring since 1966, and the highest score in regular time since 1958. The medals were presented on the pitch to both teams by presidents Putin, Macron, and Grabar-Kitarović amid a heavy rainstorm. FIFA president Gianni Infantino handed the trophy to French captain Lloris, and as he raised the trophy, a short version of the tournament's official song \"Live It Up\" was played.\nCroatian captain Modrić won the Golden Ball as best player of the tournament. Griezmann, the final's man of the match, also won the Bronze Ball and the Silver Boot award with four goals and two assists. Kylian Mbappé won the Best Young Player award for the tournament.\nAfter the match, Deschamps reflected on his own experience as captain of the victorious 1998 team, saying \"that adventure is linked to these players' adventure. I had the immense privilege to live through this 20 years ago, and in France, but what the players have just done is just as beautiful, just as powerful. I have a son who is 22 now. When we were champions, he was too young to understand. His generation now have this happiness to live through.\" Griezmann commented: \"I do not know where I am! I am really happy. It was a very difficult match, Croatia had a great game. We came back and we managed to make the difference. We cannot wait to lift the Cup and bring it back to France.\" Dalić was magnanimous, saying \"first of all I want to congratulate France\", while also expressing sadness and pride in his team's achievement. He was critical of the penalty decision, saying \"I just want to say one sentence about that penalty: You don't give a penalty like that in a World Cup final\". Modrić was also proud, both of his own achievement in winning the Golden Ball, and in the team. He said \"you know that, despite the defeat, you've achieved something big\".\nLarge crowds, including 90,000 people at the Eiffel Tower fanzone and an estimated million on the Champs-Élysées, celebrated the victory in Paris. The celebrations were marred by instances of rioting that were broken up by police, as well as the deaths of at least two people during celebrations elsewhere in the country, one man died after diving into a shallow canal and another died after crashing his car into a tree, RATP, the operator of the Paris Métro system, temporarily renamed several stations in honour of the team and its World Cup victory. \nOn 16 July, more than 550,000 fans welcomed the Croatian team home in the capital city of Zagreb, in the single largest public gathering in Croatia's history, where a six-hour-long bus tour brought them from Zagreb Airport to Ban Jelačić Square. In the following days, players were all welcomed individually in their hometowns as well.\nBroadcasting and viewership.\nFIFA estimated that the global audience for the final peaked at 1.12 billion people, including 884 million watching television broadcasts and 232 million using other platforms, including online streaming, and at public venues. According to a broadcast audit report, 86.7 percent of televisions turned on in France and 88.6 in Croatia were watching the broadcast.\nEurope.\nIn France, the final was televised on TF1 and BeIN Sports and drew an average of 26.1 million viewers, making it the most watched event ever in French television history.

        "title": "South Africa women's cricket team in England in 2018",
        "text": "The South Africa women's cricket team toured England in the 2018 cricket season, playing three Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) against the England women's cricket team, followed by a tri-series which also featured New Zealand. The WODI series formed part of the 2017–2020 ICC Women's Championship, which determined qualification for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup. England were captained by Heather Knight, while South Africa were led by Dane van Niekerk.\nThe three-match WODI series started at New Road, Worcester, where a score of 92 not out from Lizelle Lee and a strong bowling performance helped South Africa to victory. The win was their first against the hosts in England for fifteen years. In the second match, at the County Cricket Ground, Hove, England batted first once again, and centuries from Sarah Taylor and Tammy Beaumont propelled them to 331 for six. Despite a century from Lee, South Africa could not chase the target down, and England levelled the series. The final match was played at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury, where South Africa won the toss and chose to bat first. They were bowled out with one ball of the innings remaining for 228; van Niekerk top-scored with 95. In response, England chased down their required target with six overs remaining, during which Beaumont scored her second century of the series.\nSquads.\nSouth Africa named 15 players for their 2018 tour of England, making one change from the squads that had whitewashed Bangladesh during May, omitting Trisha Chetty, who had played over 150 international matches, and been their wicket-keeper for 10 years. Three of the players included—Tazmin Brits, Stacy Lackay and Zintle Mali—had made their debuts during the Bangladesh series, and a preview by \"Cricbuzz\" suggested that they were included primarily for the Women's Twenty20 International tri-series, looking toward the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20. Brits was suggested by \"Cricbuzz\" as a long-term replacement for Chetty as wicket-keeper, but an International Cricket Council (ICC) preview of the series suggested that Lizelle Lee was more likely to take on the role. Writing for \"CRICKETher\", the journalist Syd Egan said that South Africa were also boosted by the availability of Laura Wolvaardt, who had started medical school in early 2018 but after about a month of studies had her place held so she could continue her cricket career. Egan said that without Wolvaardt, South Africa's batting could be \"as brittle as it can sometimes be brilliant\".\nEngland initially named a 14-player squad for the first two matches, and made a few changes from their touring party which played India in April. Katherine Brunt and Sarah Taylor, who had both missed the India tour for medical reasons, returned to the squad, while Georgia Elwiss, Laura Marsh and Lauren Winfield were also recalled. Alex Hartley, Kate Cross and Tash Farrant were among six players who toured India that missed out on the first two WODIs. Egan noted that England's squad was very talented and full of experienced players, but lacked younger players, and he questioned whether England were \"producing the players they trust to go out there and score runs and take wickets\". England subsequently added Cross to the squad for the third WODI, while Danielle Hazell and Winfield were released from the squad.\nWODI series.\n1st WODI.\nThe first women's One Day International (WODI) was played at New Road, Worcester on 9 June. England won the toss and their captain, Heather Knight, decided to bat first. Amy Jones started the innings well for England, but was bowled by Shabnim Ismail in the fifth over for 19, after scoring all but one of England's runs to that point. Writing for \"ESPNcricinfo\", Melinda Farrell praised South Africa's bowling attack, particularly Ismail and Marizanne Kapp, who she said \"cannily exploited\" the conditions. Taylor and Knight were both dismissed leg before wicket (lbw) in the next three overs for two and four runs respectively, leaving England on 29 for three. Ayabonga Khaka was brought in as South Africa's first bowling change, and took a wicket with her first delivery, described by Farrell as \"a corker: a hint of movement through the air before the ball jagged off the seam to beat the inside of Tammy Beaumont's bat\". Khaka took two more wickets in the seventeenth over: Sciver got a leading edge which was caught by Dane van Niekerk, while Danni Wyatt was caught at cover by Suné Luus after playing at a wide delivery, moving England to 64 for six. Brunt helped England to recover, as she scored her highest total for England, remaining 72 not out at the end of the innings. After initially scoring slowly, Brunt accelerated her rate and batted alongside the tail to see England finish on 189 for nine.\nIn response, South Africa lost Wolvaardt and Luus inside the first three overs. Wolvaardt was bowled by Brunt, while Luus was stumped by Taylor off a leg-side wide when South Africa had only scored five runs. South Africa's captain, van Niekerk, joined the opening batter Lee at the crease, and the pair played cautiously against England's opening bowlers, and then more aggressively against the other bowlers. Van Niekerk was the more attacking of the pair during their partnership, and was eventually bowled for 58 when England brought back one of their opening bowlers, Anya Shrubsole. Lee then took on a more attacking role and appeared to be caught by Brunt after scoring 68 runs, but a review by the third umpire adjudged that the ball had not been caught cleanly. Lee and Mignon du Preez both remained not out to help South Africa to victory with 27 balls remaining; Lee scored 92 and du Preez 36. The win was South Africa's first against the hosts in England for fifteen years, since their 2003 tour.\n2nd WODI.\nThe series moved to the County Cricket Ground in Hove on 12 June for the second match, which was played as a day/night game. Dane van Niekerk won the toss for South Africa, and opted to chase again, letting England bat first. In contrast to the first match, England put together two strong partnerships; Jones and Tammy Beaumont put on 71 runs together before Jones was caught for 29. Taylor then joined Beaumont and the pair added 126 runs. Beaumont was praised by \"ESPNcricinfo\"s Andrew Miller for her combination of powerful shots with sweeps which prevented South Africa's bowlers from finding a rhythm. Beaumont reached her century from 107 balls, before being dismissed two deliveries later, caught in the deep. Taylor maintained England's momentum, reaching her own century from 93 balls, and going on to score 118. England finished on 331 for six, the highest score in women's ODIs at Hove.\nAs in the first match, South Africa began cautiously against England's opening bowlers; they scored 32 runs without losing a wicket from the first 10 overs, but then accelerated sharply, adding another 110 runs from the next 15 overs. Lee was once again South Africa's best batter; when Wolvaardt was caught behind off Brunt's bowling, she had only scored 32 of South Africa's 142 runs. Luus was dismissed next, three overs later for two runs, before Lee was caught at backward point. She had scored 117 runs from 107 deliveries, batting with what Miller described as \"ferocious power\". Her century marked the first time a women's international cricket match had featured three centuries. After her dismissal, at which stage the score had been 170 for three, South Africa lost their momentum, and the required run rate began to climb. Chloe Tryon added 44 runs from 26 balls, including seven boundaries, but South Africa were regularly losing wickets, and eventually completed their 50 overs on 262 for nine, losing by 69 runs.\n3rd WODI.\nThe final match of the series, which was tied at 1–1 after two matches, was played at St Lawrence Ground in Canterbury on 15 June. South Africa won the toss for the second consecutive game, and chose to bat first. Lee, who had scored the bulk of South Africa's runs in the first two matches was dismissed (lbw) early, after only scoring two runs. Replays subsequently showed that it was the wrong decision, as the ball would not have gone on to hit the stumps, but there was no review system in place to reprieve Lee. Andrie Steyn and Wolvaardt added fifty runs together before Steyn was out lbw to Sophie Ecclestone, leaving South Africa 58 for two. Dane van Niekerk joined Wolvaardt, and the pair scored a century partnership, albeit at a slow scoring-rate. Wolvaardt's dismissal for 64 brought Tryon in, and she and van Niekerk adopted a more attacking batting style. Tryon scored 19 runs from 16 balls, and soon after van Niekerk was also out, stumped by Taylor for 95 runs. \"ESPNcricinfo\"s Miller described the stumping as \"outstanding moment of the innings\". South Africa's lower-order batters did not add much to the score; du Preez scored 17 runs but four of the last five batters for South Africa did not score, and South Africa finished with 228 runs.\nIn their response, the England openers—Jones and Beaumont—scored 39 runs before Jones was dismissed for 24. Taylor only scored five runs before she was bowler by Khaka, and Knight joined Beaumont at the crease. The pair then added 154 runs together; Knight passed her half-century, while Beaumont scored a 121-ball century, her second in consecutive matches, before being dismissed lbw two balls later. Knight was joined by Sciver and England reached their target two win by seven wickets with six overs remaining."

        "title": "Survivor Series (2018)",
        "text": "The 2018 Survivor Series was the 32nd annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event took place on November 18, 2018, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. The theme of the event was brand supremacy, where all but one match involved wrestlers of the Raw brand facing wrestlers of the SmackDown brand.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including one on the Kickoff pre-show. The card was highlighted by two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches: Raw's men's and women's teams were victorious over SmackDown's. In the main event, Raw's Universal Champion Brock Lesnar defeated SmackDown's WWE Champion Daniel Bryan. Also on the card, Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey defeated SmackDown's Charlotte Flair via disqualification and Buddy Murphy retained the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Mustafa Ali in the only title defense on the card, as well as the only non-interpromotional match, which was the only match featuring wrestlers from the 205 Live brand. Raw won brand supremacy with a clean sweep over SmackDown in all six interpromotional matches on the main card. SmackDown's lone win occurred on the Kickoff pre-show in the 10-on-10 tag team elimination match.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. Announced on November 16, 2017, the 2018 event, which was the 32nd event in the Survivor Series chronology, was scheduled to be held on November 18, 2018, at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view, the event was available to livestream on the WWE Network.\nSince WWE reintroduced the brand split in 2016, Survivor Series has centered around competition between wrestlers from Raw and SmackDown for brand supremacy. In addition to traditional Survivor Series matches between the two brands, the 2017 event began the theme of having the champions of the Raw brand facing their counterparts of the SmackDown brand in non-title matches. The 2018 event had Raw's Universal Champion against SmackDown's WWE Champion, Raw's Intercontinental Champion against SmackDown's United States Champion, and the Raw Tag Team Champions against the SmackDown Tag Team Champions. A match featuring the Raw Women's Champion against the SmackDown Women's Champion was planned, but called off due to the latter sustaining a legit injury just days prior to the event. The Raw Women's Champion was instead scheduled to face a former SmackDown Women's Champion. As the 205 Live brand's WWE Cruiserweight Championship was the only title of its kind in WWE, it was the only title defended on the show and the only non-interbrand match. This was also the only Survivor Series to include the 205 Live brand, and the first since the 2009 event to feature three brands.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including one on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nAt Evolution, Ronda Rousey defeated Nikki Bella to retain the Raw Women's Championship, while Becky Lynch defeated Charlotte Flair in a Last Woman Standing match to retain the SmackDown Women's Championship. During a backstage interview following her win, Rousey was confronted by Lynch and an interpromotional non-title match between the two champions was scheduled for Survivor Series the following night on \"Raw\". On the November 12 episode of \"Raw\", Lynch led the SmackDown women's division in an invasion of Raw and applied the \"Dis-arm-her\" on Rousey. During the melee, Lynch suffered a legit broken nose and concussion following a punch from Nia Jax. Due to the injury, Lynch was pulled from the Survivor Series match and chose Flair as her replacement.\nAt Crown Jewel, AJ Styles defeated Samoa Joe to retain the WWE Championship, while Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman to win the vacant Universal Championship, setting up a rematch between Styles and Lesnar from the previous year's event. On the final \"SmackDown\" before Survivor Series, Styles and Daniel Bryan had a heated exchange stemming from their WWE Championship match two weeks prior. As such, \"SmackDown\" Commissioner Shane McMahon scheduled Styles to defend the championship against Bryan later that night. Bryan defeated Styles to become the new WWE Champion after hitting him with a low blow while the referee was knocked down, thus Bryan replaced Styles as Lesnar's opponent for Survivor Series. After the match, Bryan attacked Styles, turning heel.\nDuring the Crown Jewel Kickoff pre-show, Shinsuke Nakamura defeated Rusev to retain the United States Championship. Following the event, a match between Nakamura and Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins was scheduled for Survivor Series.\nAt Crown Jewel, The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) retained the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The New Day (represented by Big E and Kofi Kingston), while on the November 5 episode of \"Raw\", AOP (Akam and Rezar) defeated Seth Rollins in a handicap match to become the new Raw Tag Team Champions. A match between the two teams was then scheduled for Survivor Series.\nAt Super Show-Down, Buddy Murphy defeated Cedric Alexander to win the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. On the October 31 episode of \"205 Live\", Mustafa Ali defeated Tony Nese to become the number one contender, and his championship match against Murphy was scheduled for Survivor Series.\nOn the November 5 episode of \"Raw\", Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin revealed Braun Strowman, Dolph Ziggler, and Drew McIntyre as the first three members of Team Raw's men's team while naming himself as captain, although stating he would not compete due to his managerial position. Kurt Angle interjected, wanting to replace Corbin as captain, therefore Corbin had Angle face McIntyre where if Angle won, he would have been on the team; however, Angle lost. The following week, Finn Bálor defeated Ziggler in a match and returning Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon rewarded Bálor by adding him to the team. Later, Bobby Lashley won the final spot by defeating Elias. Also on that episode, Stephanie promised Strowman another Universal Championship match against Brock Lesnar and also a match against Corbin, who had cost Strowman his Universal title match at Crown Jewel (with Strowman choosing the stipulations for either match), if he could lead Raw to another victory over SmackDown and not touch Corbin until after the event. For Team SmackDown's men's team, on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", the brand's Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Paige appointed The Miz and Daniel Bryan as co-captains of Team SmackDown. Miz and Bryan then added Shane to the team as he had won the WWE World Cup at Crown Jewel. Later, Rey Mysterio and Samoa Joe joined the team after defeating Andrade \"Cien\" Almas and Jeff Hardy, respectively. A brawl then ensued between Joe, Bryan, Miz, and Shane. The following week, Bryan was removed from Team SmackDown due to his actions and subsequent WWE Championship match victory against AJ Styles, therefore replacing Styles in the champion vs. champion match. Following that alteration, Hardy replaced him after defeating Almas.\nOn the November 5 episode of \"Raw\", Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin named Alexa Bliss as captain of Team Raw's women's team, but in a non-competing capacity due to injury. The following week, Bliss revealed Mickie James, Nia Jax, Tamina, and Natalya, who was absent, as her first four picks and revealed that the winner of a match between Bayley and Sasha Banks would be the final member. During the match, the women's team attacked Bayley and Banks, causing a no-contest ruling and Bliss said neither would be on the team and then introduced Ruby Riott as the final member. For Team SmackDown's women's team, on the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", SmackDown General Manager Paige revealed Asuka, Carmella, Naomi, Sonya Deville, and Charlotte Flair as the members of Team SmackDown, but Flair did not show up; the previous week, Paige asked Flair to be captain, but Flair felt she was not the right person and then said she would think about it. Flair was instead named Becky Lynch's replacement to face Ronda Rousey, and the final member of Team SmackDown was not revealed on the final \"SmackDown\" before Survivor Series.\nOn the November 6 episode of \"SmackDown\", The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) defeated The New Day (represented by Big E and Kofi Kingston) to become the captains of Team SmackDown in the 10-on-10 tag team elimination match. Immediately after the match, The Usos chose The New Day as their first pick. The following week, The Usos added Sanity (Eric Young, Alexander Wolfe, and Killian Dain), Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, and The Colóns (Primo Colón and Epico Colón) to the team. On the November 12 episode of \"Raw\", a tag team battle royal occurred to determine Team Raw's captains. The team of Bobby Roode and Chad Gable defeated The Revival (Dash Wilder and Scott Dawson), The B-Team (Bo Dallas and Curtis Axel), Lucha House Party (Gran Metalik, Kalisto, and Lince Dorado), The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor), and the team of Heath Slater and Rhyno to win the captaincy of Team Raw, composed of all of the teams in the battle royal except Slater and Rhyno (who were the first eliminated) and the tag team elimination match was scheduled for the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, the 10-on-10 Survivor Series tag team elimination match featuring Team Raw's tag teams (Bobby Roode and Chad Gable, The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor), Lucha House Party (Kalisto and Lince Dorado, with Gran Metalik), The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder), and The B-Team (Curtis Axel and Bo Dallas)) against Team SmackDown's tag teams (The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso), The New Day (Big E and Xavier Woods, with Kofi Kingston), The Colóns (Primo and Epico), Sanity (Killian Dain and Eric Young, with Alexander Wolfe), and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) occurred. Kalisto suffered a knee injury and the referee allowed Metalik to replace him. The Revival performed \"Shatter Machine\" on Primo to eliminate The Colóns. Anderson pinned Dallas with a schoolboy to eliminate The B-Team. Gable and Roode performed their neckbreaker/moonsault combo on Young to eliminate Sanity. Woods, with assistance from Big E, performed a splash on Viktor to eliminate The Ascension. Metalik performed a springboard swanton on Anderson to eliminate Gallows and Anderson. Jey performed the \"Alley Uce\" on Dorado to eliminate Lucha House Party. New Day performed \"UpUpDownDown\" on Gable to eliminate Roode and Gable. The Revival performed \"Shatter Machine\" on Woods to eliminate The New Day. In the climax, Jimmy performed the \"Uso Splash\" on Dawson to eliminate The Revival and win the match as the lone survivors for Team SmackDown.\nAlso during the pre-show, Naomi was revealed as the captain of Team SmackDown's women's team and introduced Mandy Rose as the final member of their team. For Team Raw, a brawl ensued between Natalya and Ruby Riott. Team captain Alexa Bliss then removed Natalya and Riott from the team and replaced them with Sasha Banks and Bayley.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the women's 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (Nia Jax, Tamina, Mickie James, Sasha Banks, and Bayley) (accompanied by Alexa Bliss) against Team SmackDown (Naomi, Asuka, Carmella (accompanied by R-Truth), Sonya Deville, and Mandy Rose). Tamina performed a superkick on Naomi to eliminate her. Carmella then surprised Tamina with a schoolgirl to eliminate her. Deville performed a sliding knee on James followed by Rose pinning James to eliminate her. Bayley performed the \"Bayley to Belly\" on Carmella to eliminate her. Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\" on Rose, forcing Rose to submit, thereby eliminating Rose. Bayley and Deville brawled outside of the ring to a double countout, eliminating both women. After a competitive battle between Asuka and Banks, Banks attempted a Meteora on Asuka from the top rope, but Jax shoved her off and into the \"Asuka Lock\" by Asuka, resulting in Banks' elimination. Afterwards, Jax performed three leg drops and a Samoan drop on Asuka to win the match as the sole survivor for Team Raw.\nBackstage, Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon and Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin celebrated the win. Stephanie told Corbin that if Raw has a clean sweep over SmackDown on the main card, she would consider making him the permanent Raw General Manager.\nNext, Raw's Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins faced SmackDown's United States Champion Shinsuke Nakamura. During the match, Rollins performed three suicide dives and a springboard clothesline on Nakamura for a nearfall. Rollins performed a ripcord knee for a nearfall. Nakamura performed a \"Kinshasa\" for a nearfall. In the end, Rollins performed \"The Stomp\" on Nakamura to win the match.\nAfter that, Raw Tag Team Champions AOP (Akam and Rezar) (accompanied by Drake Maverick) faced SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Bar (Cesaro and Sheamus) (accompanied by Big Show). In the climax, Sheamus performed the \"Brogue Kick\" on Rezar, but during the pin attempt, Maverick placed Rezar's foot on the bottom rope, voiding the pinfall. Cesaro chased Maverick, who ran into Big Show. Big Show grabbed Maverick by the throat, only for Maverick to pee in his pants. This distraction allowed AOP to perform a neckbreaker/powerbomb combo on Sheamus to win the match for Raw.\nNext was the only non-interpromotional match and only title defense on the show in which Buddy Murphy defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Mustafa Ali. In the end, Murphy performed \"Murphy's Law\" on Ali to retain the title.\nIn the fifth match, the men's 5-on-5 Survivor Series elimination match, featuring Team Raw (Drew McIntyre, Dolph Ziggler, Braun Strowman, Bobby Lashley (with Lio Rush), and Finn Bálor) (with Baron Corbin) against Team SmackDown (The Miz, Shane McMahon, Rey Mysterio, Samoa Joe, and Jeff Hardy) was contested. Strowman was going to start the match, only for McIntyre to quickly tag himself in. As McIntyre mocked Strowman, Joe took advantage and applied the \"Coquina Clutch\" on McIntyre, who was able to escape and perform the \"Claymore Kick\" to eliminate Joe. Shane and Ziggler then faced off. A brawl broke out between Strowman and McIntyre, which led to Team SmackDown attacking them. Outside of the ring, Shane performed an elbow drop on Strowman through an announce table. Mysterio eliminated Bálor after a \"619\" and a springboard frog splash. Shane performed a \"Coast to Coast\" on Ziggler to eliminate him. Shane attempted another \"Coast to Coast\" on Lashley, only for Strowman, who recovered from earlier, to perform a clothesline in mid-air on Shane. Hardy went for the \"Twist of Fate\", but Strowman blocked and powerslammed Hardy to eliminate him. Mysterio was able to momentarily subdue Strowman and attempted a \"619\", but Strowman intercepted him with a powerslam, resulting in Mysterio's elimination. After chasing The Miz out of the ring and back inside, Strowman performed a powerslam on The Miz to eliminate him. In the climax, Shane told Strowman to \"bring it\", and Strowman responded with a dropkick and a running powerslam to win the match for Team Raw with Strowman, McIntyre, and Lashley as the survivors. After the match, Corbin attacked Strowman and quickly retreated with McIntyre and Lashley.\nBackstage, Seth Rollins was interviewed by Charly Caruso. She informed Rollins that he would be defending the Intercontinental Championship against his friend-turned-rival Dean Ambrose at .\nIn the penultimate match, Raw Women's Champion Ronda Rousey faced SmackDown's Charlotte Flair in a non-title match. After an even match between the two, Rousey performed \"Piper's Pit\" on Flair, only for Flair to perform a \"Spear\" on Rousey for a nearfall. Rousey attempted an \"armbar\", but Flair blocked and applied the \"figure-four leglock\". Rousey was able to reverse the pressure, and both women rolled out of the ring. Flair performed a \"Big Boot\" on Rousey for a nearfall. In the climax, Rousey performed a second \"Piper's Pit\" on Flair and attempted the \"Armbar\" again, but Flair rolled out of the ring.

After the match, Flair continued to attack Rousey with kendo sticks. In the ring, Flair performed \"Natural Selection\" on Rousey on a chair. Flair positioned Rousey's neck in the chair and stomped on it before departing backstage.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Raw's Universal Champion Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) faced SmackDown's WWE Champion Daniel Bryan. Lesnar performed several suplexes on Bryan. Lesnar performed an \"F-5\" on Bryan, but during the pin attempt, he intentionally broke the fall himself. Lesnar attempted a second \"F-5\" on Bryan, only to accidentally hit the referee in the process. While the referee was down, Bryan seized the opportunity to low blow Lesnar. Bryan performed a running knee on Lesnar for a nearfall. Bryan began to target Lesnar's knee by slamming it into the ring post. Back in the ring, as Lesnar attempted another \"F-5\", Lesnar's knee gave out. Bryan capitalized and performed the \"Yes! Lock\" submission, only for Lesnar to escape. In the end, as Bryan applied a triangle hold on Lesnar, Lesnar countered and performed the \"F-5\" on Bryan to win the match, with Raw winning brand supremacy with a clean sweep over SmackDown on the main card.\nEnzo Amore hijacking incident.\nFormer WWE wrestler Enzo Amore was spotted during the event wearing a disguised wig and hoodie in the background. At the beginning of the AOP and The Bar match, when it became clear that it was Amore, he started making a scene, standing on his chair, dancing and yelling at the crowd. While WWE did not acknowledge his presence, Amore was then escorted out of the building by security and was banned from future events at the Staples Center. Reports also stated that Amore had bumped into a woman, causing her to get knocked over, injuring the fan in the process.\nThis incident came hours after he released a new album called \"Rosemary's Baby Pt. 1: Happy Birthday\" featuring a song that seems to include lyrics about his ex-girlfriend and current WWE wrestler Liv Morgan.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", Commissioner Stephanie McMahon opened the show and celebrated the Raw brand's clean sweep over SmackDown. Stephanie was interrupted by Braun Strowman, who wanted his promised matches. She granted Strowman a match with Acting Raw General Manager Baron Corbin at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs and Strowman chose a TLC match as the stipulation. In regard to his promised Universal Championship match, Stephanie said that if Strowman defeated Corbin, then he would get his title match at the Royal Rumble and Corbin would be stripped of all authority, but if Corbin won, Corbin would become the permanent Raw General Manager. Later that night, during an elimination tag team match, Corbin, Drew McIntyre, and Bobby Lashley attacked Strowman, injuring his elbow, as a storyline excuse for Strowman to take a short time off and undergo surgery to remove bone spurs.\nFresh off her disqualification victory over Charlotte Flair, Ronda Rousey confirmed that she would be defending the Raw Women's Championship against Nia Jax at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs as Jax had won a 20-woman battle royal at Evolution to earn the title match. Rousey then made an open challenge and successfully defended the title against Mickie James. After the match, Rousey was taunted by Jax and Tamina.\nSmackDown.\nCharlotte Flair explained her actions on the following episode of \"SmackDown\", stating that her attack on Ronda Rousey was for the women of SmackDown and for her friend Becky Lynch. However, SmackDown General Manager Paige fined Flair $100,000 for attacking WWE officials during the brawl. After being interrupted by The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce), Flair had back-to-back singles matches with both. She defeated Kay by submission and then Royce by disqualification after Kay attacked Flair, who in turn laid out both IIconics. The following week, a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match between Lynch and Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship was scheduled for TLC. Later that night, Asuka won a battle royal to be added to the match.\nWWE Champion Daniel Bryan explained his actions from the previous week by stating that he was following his dreams to become champion again and accused the fans of not being there for him during his three-year quest to return to the ring. Bryan claimed that he allowed Brock Lesnar to beat out what was left of his old self and rechristened himself as the \"new\" Daniel Bryan while also saying that the \"Yes! Movement\" was dead. It was then announced that AJ Styles would receive his WWE Championship rematch against Bryan at TLC: Tables, Ladders &amp; Chairs."

        "text": "Vladimir Petrović (born 11 May 1929) is a Croatian former professional tennis player who represented Yugoslavia and later emigrated to the United States.\nBiography.\nPetrović, a three-time national champion, played Davis Cup tennis for Yugoslavia. He also competed several times at both the French Championships and Wimbledon. Although he held a law degree from the University of Zagreb, he chose not to practise law as he would have been required to join the Communist Party.\nHis most noted performance in a Grand Slam tournament was reaching the third round of the 1951 Wimbledon Championships. He won five set matches in both of the opening two rounds, then had his run ended by American Ham Richardson.\nIn 1952 he made his Davis Cup debut in a tie against Finland and also featured in a tie with Great Britain, in which he had a win over Roger Becker. The following year he took part in a tie against France in his native Croatia, where he lost a marathon five setter to Robert Haillet, but was able to defeat Robert Abdesselam in the reverse singles. He finished his Davis Cup career with an 8/10 overall record from seven ties, the last in 1955, just months before he defected.\nWith Yugoslavia under Communist rule, Petrović made the decision to defect in 1955. His wife Georgia, a renowned table tennis player, had temporarily left the country on a student exchange program, which gave him an opportunity to seek asylum when he travelled to England for the 1955 Wimbledon Championships. He ended up in Germany, where he remained based for the next four years. In 1958 he won the Dutch Championships and made his last appearance at Wimbledon, beaten by eventual runner-up Neale Fraser.\nIn 1959 he moved to Los Angeles with his family. At the LA Tennis Club(LATC) he defeated many Top US and Australian tennis players in the Pacific South West(PSW) tournament in Septembers after the US Championships in New York. His son Glenn competed on the professional tennis circuit."

This species of cricket is only found in two localities, the Morne Seychellois National Park and \"La Reserve\". The species had not been recorded since 1909, until its rediscovery in 2014. It is a restricted range species, with an area of occupancy less than and with a very fragmented population.\nThis species of boulder cricket is flightless and only found in caves and under large boulders. The population is assumed to be declining due to the deterioration of its habitat, threatened by the invasion of alien plants species like \"Cinnamomum verum\" and \"Clidemia hirta\".\nAxel Hochkirch, co-chair of the IUCN’s Grasshopper Specialist Group has said, “We have no idea how many individuals exist in total. Insect populations can be quite large in a small area. The problem with many insect populations is that [they are found in] small areas which can rapidly be destroyed by humans, so that even a large population can disappear rapidly.” The IUCN specialist group intends to publish a field guide to identify different species of the order Orthoptera, that includes crickets and grasshoppers; of the islands of Seychelles to assist local conservationists."

        "title": "USA Cricket",
        "text": "USA Cricket (USAC) is the governing body of cricket in the United States. USA Cricket operates all of the United States national representative cricket sides, including the men's and women's national teams and youth teams, as well as Major League Cricket, which is the highest level of domestic American Twenty20 cricket.\nThe body was unveiled on September 24, 2017, as a proposed successor to the United States of America Cricket Association, which had been expelled from the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June 2017 due to governance issues. In January 2019, it was approved as an associate member of the ICC.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nIn June 2017, the ICC voted to expel the USACA from the ICC, due to issues with governance of the sport in the United States. Control of the United States national team was handed over to ICC Americas until a new board was formed.\nCreation and first years.\nOn September 24, 2017 (the anniversary of the 1844 Canada-United States cricket match, and on the heels of a U.S. victory in the Canada-U.S. K.A. Auty Cup), USA Cricket was announced as a new proposed sanctioning body, including a logo unveiled by Denver-based group Adrenalin (using a cricket bat as the main symbol, deeming it to have stronger symbolism with the sport among the U.S. audience than other common symbols, such as the stumps or ball). The new body stated that its goal was to help build popularity for the game among a \"mainstream\" audience (as opposed to predominantly expats from other regions), with project manager Eric Parthen describing it as a \"fresh start\" that would \"celebrate the past and look to the future\".\nUSA Cricket elected its first independent board in mid-2018. In November 2018, USA Cricket put out a request for proposals surrounding the establishment of a domestic Twenty20 league by 2021, with goals to \"engage existing fans and grow new ones to support the bullish vision this Board has for cricket in the US\", and \"support the sustainable development of cricketing infrastructure across the United States\" (noting that Central Broward Regional Park was the only ICC-certified cricket grounds in the country). In January 2019, USA Cricket was officially approved by the ICC as its 105th associate member.\nIn May 2019, USA Cricket announced that it had accepted a bid by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) for a $1 billion investment in its proposed T20 league; ACE's partners include Satyan Gajwani and Vineet Jain of The Times Group, and Willow TV founders Sameer Mehta and Vijay Srinivasan. ACE will provide investments for the league (including developmental and professional circuits), facilities, and support of the U.S. national teams.\nDuring its inaugural annual general meeting in February 2020, USA Cricket announced plans to launch its franchise-based T20 league Major League Cricket in 2021, stage the inaugural season of its development league Minor League Cricket in 2020, back proposals for cricket to be staged at the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, and pursue bids to host a future ICC tournament in the country between 2023 and 2031. It was also stated that USA Cricket may attempt to pursue full member status with the ICC.\nIn October 2020, USA Cricket unveiled a \"foundational plan\" for 2020–23, including plans to promote youth and women's cricket, primarily focus on T20 (including the launch of Major League Cricket in 2022, delayed from 2021 due to COVID-19), and partner with Cricket West Indies on bids to host ICC events in the United States. The organization plans to initially target its activities towards markets where there is \"already significant interest in and passion for the sport\". USA Cricket also set long-term goals to reach ICC full member status by 2030. It aimed to qualify for the 2022 Under-19 Cricket World Cup (however, all qualification tournaments were cancelled due to COVID-19, and Canada thus qualified automatically based on previous performance), and to \"develop a clear and balanced long-term international playing calendar for our national teams that includes more content, played more frequently against competitive opposition.\"\nIn November 2020, USA Cricket announced that ACE had leased AirHogs Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas (which previously operated as the home of the recently folded Texas AirHogs baseball team), with plans to redevelop it as a cricket-specific stadium and as home field of a Texas-based franchise in Major League Cricket.\nIn November 2021, the ICC announced that Cricket West Indies and USA Cricket would co-host the 2024 Men's T20 World Cup, with matches expected to be played in both regions.\nContinued non-compliance and financial issues.\nIn March 2021, two USA Cricket board members filed a lawsuit against CEO Iain Higgins and five other board members, alleging irregularities in its election process, including a referendum to immediately grant voting rights to members rather than requiring that they be members for 12 months (allegedly expanding the voting base to over 20,000 eligible members) that was implemented despite not meeting the required supermajority, and the organization having indefinitely delayed annual elections that were required to occur at the end of November. The election continued to be delayed . On November 15, 2021, it was reported that Higgins had stepped down as CEO, amid internal issues within the organization; the position remained vacant. The lawsuit was settled in May 2022, after board chairman Paraag Marathe announced his resignation, which allowed the elections to move forward and begin on July 8, 2022. Separately, ex-CEO Iain Higgins was given $300,000 as part of an agreement to avoid more legal action against USAC.\nOn October 3, 2022, it was reported that USA Cricket was seriously in debt, had failed to file annual financial reports, and failed to host an annual general meeting in 2020, leading the ICC to suspend funding payments. The curtailment of Ireland's December 2021 series against the United States due to COVID-19 outbreaks (causing only the T20 matches to be played) was reported to have resulted in six-figure losses for the sanctioning body.\nIt was concurrently reported that USA Cricket had been removed as an administrative co-host of the 2024 T20 World Cup due to these issues, but that Cricket West Indies would still host tournament matches in the United States. Ahead of the next annual general meeting on October 9, Srinivasan stated that ACE was concerned over USA Cricket's mounting debt, and concerns that players and board members were not being paid despite ACE's agreements and funding.\nACE had chosen not to fully back the Ireland series due to cost concerns related to its scheduling and COVID-19 protocols. The series, which cost $400,000 to host, was not part of USA Cricket's budget for 2021. Srinivasan explained that USAC \"came in far, far below even what we thought they would come short of\", and \"the way this arrangement is meant to work is they find a Full Member or multiple Full Members to come and we would fund all of that. The exposure is meant to be ours and then we would monetize it, commercialize it and if there is a loss, that's our loss to bear. This was unique in the sense that we were not willing to do it given all the constraints. So we said if this is something you still want to go ahead, you do all of it. We'll front you the cash to pull it off, but you keep all the revenue. But the exposure is also yours.\"\nOn October 10 during the AGM, USA Cricket's new treasurer Kuljit Singh-Nijjar issued a report stating that it had amassed $650,000 in debt by the end of 2021, citing spending higher than budgeted projections, nearly $800,000 in \"administrative expenses\", and falling short of its projection of $1.1 million in sponsorship revenue. Due to these issues, the 2022 USA Cricket senior men's and junior national championships were cancelled. Interim board chairman Atul Rai stated that it had resolved its outstanding payments to the ICC, and was also evaluating candidates for its new CEO. On October 21, Vinay Bhimjiani was appointed as the new CEO of USA Cricket. Later that week, USAC's Nominating and Governance Committee (NGC) announced that they were accepting applications for 3 independent directors.\nUSA Cricket, in cobordance with the NGC, then went on to announce their postponed 2021 elections on November 19, 2022. In their announcement, they released their member eligibility lists and also separately announced calls for 3 board directors.\nFresh lawsuits and governance problems.\nIn January 2023, USAC announced Patricia Whittaker, David Haubert, and Pintoo Shah replacing the former Paraag Marathe, Rohan Sajdeh, and Catherine Carlson as independent board directors. This sparked controversy as Whittaker served USA Cricket prior as a selector in 2021, going against USAC's constitution, stating that a person must not have held position in USAC, the ICC, or any national, local, or regional governing and administrative body within 3 years of the date of applicable election.\nShortly thereafter, an email co-signed by 21 people was sent to USA Cricket challenging the constitutionality of the NGC. The email protested and pointed out many instances of USAC constitution violations ahead of the 2021 USAC elections, threatening legal action if the problems weren't resolved. Following the email, USAC excluded email co-signers Sushil Nadkarni, Ajay Jhamb, and others from their final candidates and voter list for the 2021 elections. Additionally, USAC also approved many ineligible candidates for the elections, sparking further controversy.\nFollowing many email co-signers' exclusion from the 2021 elections and USAC's inability to overhaul and \"roll back any past improper actions\" of the NGC, Nadkarni and Jhamb filed a joint-lawsuit against USA Cricket and members of the NGC. The lawsuit alleged \"numerous\" violations of USA Cricket's constitution by the NGC and requested that USA Cricket be forced to deconstruct its NGC, which they allege was formed unconstitutionally. The lawsuit additionally points out other numerous unconstitutional actions, including the appointment of Whittaker as an independent director, a lack of election candidates, and the approval of many ineligible election candidates and voters. As a result, a court hearing was scheduled for the third week of February. The court then imposed a restraining order on the 2021 elections which were set to be held on February 6.\nDomestic tournaments.\nThe USAC organize following national-level tournaments:"

        "title": "2034 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The 2034 FIFA World Cup will be the 25th FIFA World Cup, a quadrennial international football tournament contested by the men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. It is set to be hosted in Saudi Arabia, as it was the only nation to submit a bid in time for FIFA's deadline of 31 October 2023. \nFIFA restricted the hosting eligibility to Asia or Oceania after it made the decision to host the 2030 World Cup on three continents (Africa, Europe and South America). Observers characterised this as paving the path for Saudi Arabia to host the 2034 World Cup by substantially reducing potential competing host bids. FIFA also unexpectedly sped up the bidding timeline by at least three years, which hindered other potential bidders. According to reporting by \"The New York Times\", FIFA president Gianni Infantino played a key role in the selection of Saudi Arabia as host.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding process for the 2034 World Cup began on 4 October 2023 and initially used the same requirements as the 2030 World Cup. FIFA later lowered the requirement for the number of existing stadiums with a minimum capacity of 40,000 from seven to four. Due to FIFA's confederation rotation policy, only member associations from the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation were eligible to host. FIFA made the decision to host the 2030 World Cup in three continents (Africa, Europe and South America) and the 2026 World Cup was set to be held in North America, which meant that the 2034 World Cup would necessarily have to be held in Asia or Oceania.\nOn 31 October 2023, FIFA president Gianni Infantino announced that Saudi Arabia would host the 2034 World Cup, making it the third time the Asian Football Confederation has or will host the World Cup, after the 2002 tournament, which was hosted in Japan and South Korea and the 2022 tournament in Qatar, as well as the second time being held in the Middle East, after Qatar 2022.\nAccording to investigative reporting by \"The New York Times\", Infantino played a key role in the selection of Saudi Arabia as host. He engaged in private diplomacy on Saudi Arabia's behalf, as he explored whether Greece would be willing to partner with Saudi Arabia to host the 2030 World Cup. When Spain, Portugal and Morocco announced that they would bid together for the 2030 World Cup, the Saudis considered it unlikely that the bid could be beaten. Thus, the Saudis backed out of bidding for 2030. FIFA subsequently made two moves that \"The New York Times\" described as \"curious\", as FIFA announced that the first three games of the 2030 World Cup would be played in Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay while the rest would be played in Spain, Morocco and Portugal. This decision ruled Europe, Africa and South America out as potential bidders for the 2034 World Cup, and meant that the only potential bidders could be from Asia or Oceania. FIFA also unexpectedly sped up the bidding process for the 2034 World Cup, giving only 25 days for interested nations to express their intent to host. Within minutes, Saudi Arabia announced that it wanted to host.\nBids.\nSaudi Arabia.\nAfter Saudi Arabia abandoned its 2030 bid alongside Greece and Egypt, they switched their focus to a solo 2034 bid. Similar strategies to the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, which was held in November-December as opposed to the usual summer scheduling, may be used to mitigate the country's summer heat, though SAFF insisted on a plan to host in the summer. The country's bid was announced on 4 October 2023. On 5 October, AFC President Salman bin Ibrahim Al Khalifa backed Saudi Arabia's bid. On the 9th, Saudi Arabia announced that it submitted the official letter of intent and signed the declaration to FIFA to bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, and that over 70 member associations already pledged their support for its bid.\nDeclined bids.\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nThe first bid for the 2034 FIFA World Cup was proposed as a collective bid by the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ten countries: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam). The idea of a combined ASEAN bid was mooted as early as January 2011, when the former Football Association of Singapore President, Zainudin Nordin, said in a statement that the proposal was made at an ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting, despite the fact that countries cannot bid (as that's up to national associations). In 2013, Nordin and Special Olympics Malaysia President, Datuk Mohamed Faisol Hassan, recalled the idea for ASEAN to jointly host a World Cup. Under FIFA rules as of 2017, the 2030 World Cup cannot be held in Asia (AFC) as Asian Football Confederation members are excluded from the bidding following the selection of Qatar in 2022. Therefore, the earliest bid by an AFC member could be made for 2034.\nLater, Malaysia withdrew from involvement, but Singapore and other ASEAN countries continued the campaign to submit a joint bid for the World Cup in 2034. In February 2017, ASEAN held talks on launching a joint bid during a visit by FIFA President Gianni Infantino to Yangon, Myanmar. On 1 July 2017, Vice General Chairman of the Football Association of Indonesia Joko Driyono said that Indonesia and Thailand were set to lead a consortium of Southeast Asian nations in the bid. Driyono added that due to geographic and infrastructure considerations and the expanded format (48 teams), at least two or three ASEAN countries combined would be in a position necessary to host matches.\nIn September 2017, the Thai League 1 Deputy CEO Benjamin Tan, at the ASEAN Football Federation (AFF) Council meeting, confirmed that his Association \"put in their interest to bid and co-host\" the 2034 World Cup with Indonesia. On the same occasion, the General Secretary of the AFF, Dato Sri Azzuddin Ahmad, confirmed that Indonesia and Thailand would submit a joint bid. Indonesia was the first Asian team and the only Southeast Asian country to have participated in the World Cup, when the territory was known as the Dutch East Indies.\nHowever, in June 2018, FIFA executive committee member, Yang di-Pertuan Agong and Sultan of Pahang, Tengku Abdullah, who is also the former president of the Football Association of Malaysia (FAM), expressed interest in joining the two countries in hosting the World Cup together. The same year, Vietnam expressed interest in joining the bid for the same competition, despite some infrastructure concerns. The four countries jointly hosted a football event before during the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.\nIn June 2019, the Prime Minister of Thailand, Prayut Chan-o-cha, announced that all 10 nations of ASEAN would launch a joint-bid to host the 2034 FIFA World Cup, being the first to submit a ten-country joint bid in the FIFA World Cup history.\nOn 9 October 2019, five ASEAN countries officially proposed hosting the 2034 FIFA World Cup. Thailand is to lead the initiative.\nOn 15 June 2022, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, in his role as chair of ASEAN, said he would urge Southeast Asian leaders to bid to host the FIFA World Cup in 2034 or 2038.\nAustralia and with other hosts.\nAfter its failed bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia considered a joint bid with neighbouring New Zealand, an OFC member with which they co-hosted the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. Australia re-established this intention in August 2021, shortly after Brisbane's success in bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics. A joint bid with Indonesia and other ASEAN nations instead of New Zealand was also discussed by Football Australia. However, Indonesia remained reluctant to the joint bid with Australia, considering the country is also taking part in the ASEAN bid for the same competition. An alternative suggestion is for Australia and New Zealand to partner alongside Malaysia and Singapore, instead of Indonesia even though both countries are also involved in the ASEAN bid as well.\nFootball Australia chief executive, James Johnson, said his organisation was \"exploring the possibility\" following FIFA's deadline for bids to be submitted by 31 October 2023. A major challenge to the bid however was the need to construct more stadiums or expand current stadiums to FIFA standards. Indonesia was in talks with Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia with a joint bid, though they pulled out on 18 October, backing the Saudi bid instead like much of the AFC.\nOn 31 October, Football Australia put out a statement saying that they decided against bidding, leaving Saudi Arabia as the sole bid.\nPotential venues.\nThe official list of stadiums is yet to be confirmed, but it is reported that the tournament might be held in Riyadh, Jeddah, Dammam, Qiddiya, Ḥaʼil, Neom, Najran, Abha, Al Hofuf, Al Khobar, Al Qatif, Taif and Buraidah, since stadiums in some of those cities are in development or renovation to meet FIFA World Cup standards for the 2027 AFC Asian Cup."

The qualification was based on the world rankings of 14 January 2018 (the seventh world cup event of the season, in St. Moritz). Pilots had to compete in five different races on three different tracks during the 2016/17 season or 2017/18 season. Each continent (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania) and the hosts were allowed to enter a sled provided they met the above standard. For each men's event 30 sleds were allowed to compete (maximum of three NOCs with three sleds and six NOCs with two sleds). For the women's event there were a total of 20 sleds allowed to compete (maximum of two NOCs with three sleds, four NOCs with two sleds). According to the rules women were eligible for the \"4-man\" event as well but none competed in the applicable races.\nQualification timeline.\nRaces from 15 October 2017 until 14 January 2018 were used for qualification for the Olympics. In general this meant that the Olympic field was to be established by using the first seven world cup races of the 2017–18 season, but also included results from European, and American cup races. Four sleds then were allocated in each of the three competitions, first for the host (if not already qualified), and then for continents not previously represented. If a nation refused a quota it was reallocated. Unused or reallocated were to be filled by 19 January 2018 by nations not previously entered.\nQuota allocation.\nThe following summary is based on the final IBSF quotas after reallocation. Numbers beside each nation indicate the rank of the sled that establishes the NOC's number of qualifiers.\nTwo man.\nFinal rankings by nation.\nFour man.\nFinal rankings by nation.\nTwo woman.\nFinal rankings by nation."

        "title": "Taiwan Cycling Route No.1",
        "text": "Taiwan Cycle Route No.1 (環島1號線) is a 968 km (602 mile) bicycle route around the island of Taiwan. The route is intended to facilitate the recreational activity of bicycling around the island of Taiwan, which is called huan-dao (環島) in Mandarin Chinese, and is also translated as a \"cycle-the-island-trip\". The route was developed by the Taiwan (R.O.C.) Ministry of Transportation and Communications and inaugurated on December 30, 2015. The route is marked with road signs and road markings and it follows a mixture of dedicated bicycle paths, less-traveled country roads, and busier roads with dedicated cycle lanes. Although the route may be started at any point, the initial 0 kilometer marking is at Songshan Station in Taipei. Cycling the entire route generally takes 9–12 days.\nBicycle culture in Taiwan.\nIn the 1980s, the bicycle manufacturing company Giant Bicycles became a booming enterprise in Taiwan. The rising popularity of bicycle riding in Taiwan led the government to develop cycling infrastructure in the mid-2000s. In 2006, the film \"Island Etude\" was released, which tells the adventurous story of a deaf Taiwanese man who bicycled the 1000 km journey around the island. The movie has been credited with sparking the around-island cycle trip – called huan-dao (環島) – to become part of the Taiwanese identity. Cycling around the island became one of the three \"Taiwan triathlon\" activities, which include hiking the tallest mountain in Taiwan, the Jade Mountain (Yushan), and swimming across the Sun Moon Lake.\nDevelopment of Taiwan Cycle Route 1.\nThe Taiwanese Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) began planning an around-the-island cycling route in 2013. Taiwan Cycle Route No.1 was launched on December 30, 2015. The project's total budget was NT$1.2 billion (36.4 million USD) and organization required collaboration with the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration and the Taiwanese Ministries of Education and the Interior. In addition, the MOTC collaborated with the Taiwanese police force to set up rest stops at police stations around the island. \nIn 2015, the MOTC expressed plans to develop a second and third around-island cycle route in the future.\nRoute details.\nThe Taiwan Cycle Route No.1 itinerary recommended by the Taiwanese Institute of Transportation (IOT) takes 9 days, and depending on health and fitness, about 3 1/2 to 6 1/2 hours per stage, with an optional addition of two days for sightseeing at Sun Moon Lake. The highest climb of Taiwan Cycling Route No.1 is the Shouka climb, which rises nearly 500 m (1640.42 ft) up the Southern Taiwanese mountains. According to the Taiwanese Institute of Transportation (IOT), Taiwan Cycle Route No.1 has signs and marked lines placed at major intersections, at the intersection of cross-roads greater than 15m, at Y-shape intersections, and at bridges. Furthermore, the IOT has provided markings every 2 km of the route, markings every 500m in downtown areas, signs around rest stations, and mileage markings signs. The route also includes 122 designated rest-stops for cyclists. The official route travels counterclockwise around the island, beginning at Songshan station in Taipei. \n– Source:"

        "text": "Group B of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 15 to 25 June 2018. The group consisted of Portugal, Spain, Morocco, and Iran. The top two teams, Spain and Portugal, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nMorocco vs Iran.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nAmine Harit fired wide with a volley from the edge of the penalty area after two minutes. Younès Belhanda and Medhi Benatia squandered close-range chances in a penalty box before Iran finally countered after 20 minutes, only for Karim Ansarifard to scuff his shot when clean through on goal. Sardar Azmoun then latched onto Omid Ebrahimi's through ball, but his shot was too low and Munir Mohamedi saved low with his feet. In the final 10 minutes Hakim Ziyech lashed the ball towards the bottom-left corner of the net from 20 yards but Alireza Beiranvand stopped the ball. In the last minutes, Ehsan Hajsafi's delivery from the left was met by a header from Aziz Bouhaddouz that flew into the left corner of his own net.\nIran won just their second match at the World Cup (D3 L8), with this is their first victory since beating the United States 2–1 in June 1998. Iran did not attempt a single shot in the second half and were the first team since 1966 to score a goal in a half of World Cup football without attempting a shot. Iran also maintained their unbeaten streak against CAF teams in the World Cup, having drawn Angola 1–1 in 2006 and Nigeria 0–0 in 2014; while this was also Iran's first ever victory against any Arab team in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPortugal vs Spain.\nThe two teams had met in 35 previous matches, including in the round of 16 of the 2010 FIFA World Cup, won by Spain 1–0. Their most recent meeting was in the UEFA Euro 2012 semi-finals, when Spain won 4–2 on penalties after a goalless draw in normal time.\nCristiano Ronaldo scored with an early penalty, winning it after he was fouled by Nacho inside the box. Diego Costa then twisted and turned away from two Portugal defenders to score with a low shot to the left corner which brought the two sides level. But just before the break, David de Gea fumbled a Ronaldo shot from outside the penalty box through his gloves and over the line. Costa scored his second equaliser of the night just after the restart from close range before Nacho scored with a right foot half-volley in off the post from the edge of the penalty box, his first goal for Spain. As the clock ticked down, however, Gerard Piqué brought down Ronaldo just outside the box, with the Portugal star completing the scoring and his hat-trick with a free-kick into the top right corner of the net.\nRonaldo became the fourth player to score in four different World Cup tournaments (2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018) after Pelé, Uwe Seeler and Miroslav Klose, and also the first to score in eight consecutive World Cups and European Championships. At age 33, Ronaldo also became the oldest hat-trick scorer in the World Cup, surpassing Rob Rensenbrink of the Netherlands, who scored three times against Iran in 1978, aged 30. With this result, Spain has not won any opening matches since 2006, having lost to Switzerland 0–1 in 2010 and the Netherlands 1–5 in 2014.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPortugal vs Morocco.\nThe two teams had met previously only once, a group stage game in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, won by Morocco 3–1.\nJoão Moutinho swung in a cross from the right after a short corner and Cristiano Ronaldo headed the ball powerfully past goalkeeper Munir Mohamedi from six yards out and into the middle of the goal to open the scoring in the 4th minute. Ronaldo played Gonçalo Guedes into the box but Munir made a one-handed save. Ronaldo shot over the crossbar when Bernardo Silva's mishit presented him with a shooting chance on the edge of the box early in the second half. Rui Patrício then made a save to preserve Portugal's lead when Hakim Ziyech's free-kick was headed towards goal by Younès Belhanda, the goalkeeper diving to palm the ball away from danger. Ziyech shot another set-piece just over the crossbar from 25 yards. Nordin Amrabat and Medhi Benatia fired over with better chances. With their second loss in a row, Morocco became the first team to be eliminated from the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\n85 international goals for Ronaldo is a new record for a European player, with Ronaldo passing Ferenc Puskás to hold the record outright. Ronaldo has become the first Portuguese player since José Torres in 1966 to score a goal with his right foot, left foot and head in a single World Cup tournament. Ronaldo is the first player to score five consecutive World Cup goals for his team since Oleg Salenko for Russia in 1994.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIran vs Spain.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nSpain had their first attempt on goal in the 25th minute when David Silva's long-range free-kick was held by Alireza Beiranvand. Five minutes later, Silva's volley sailed narrowly over the crossbar from six yards out. At the start of the 2nd half, Gerard Piqué's close-range effort was blocked and then Beiranvand palmed away Sergio Busquets' curled effort from the edge of the penalty area. Karim Ansarifard's effort from a corner flashed into David de Gea's side netting. In the 54th minute, Diego Costa picked up Andrés Iniesta's pass inside the area and saw Ramin Rezaeian's attempted clearance ricochet off his leg and past Beiranvand low into the left corner of the net. Saeid Ezatolahi pulled Iran level shortly after the hour but his close-range finish after a scramble was ruled out courtesy of VAR after Rezaeian was found in an offside position. Mehdi Taremi's back-post header fizzed over De Gea's crossbar seven minutes from time as Iran pushed for an equaliser, but Spain held on for a 1–0 win.\nIran did not manage a shot on target for the first time in 14 World Cup games.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIran vs Portugal.\nThe two teams had met twice, most recently in a group stage game in the 2006 FIFA World Cup, won by Portugal 2–0.\nIn the 45 minute, Ricardo Quaresma cut in from the right before scoring with a curling shot off the outside of his right foot that looped over Alireza Beiranvand into the top-left corner. Saeid Ezatolahi's foul on Cristiano Ronaldo won Portugal a penalty, which Ronaldo shot low into the right, enabling Beiranvand to get down and make a stop. Iran then managed to get a penalty in stoppage time after referee used VAR to determine that Cédric's handball from Sardar Azmoun's header had been intentional, which Karim Ansarifard converted high to his right. The game ended in a 1−1 draw, with Portugal advancing and Iran eliminated.\nQuaresma (34 years, 272 days old) is the oldest player to score on his first World Cup start since Yahya Golmohammadi (35 years, 84 days old), who did so for Iran in 2006 against Mexico. Iran's goal - scored after 92 minutes and 48 seconds - was the latest goal Portugal have ever conceded at the World Cup. This was Iran's best performance ever in the FIFA World Cup, winning four points and having earned their first ever draw against any European opponents since 1978, when Iran drew 1–1 to Scotland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSpain vs Morocco.\nDespite their geographical proximity, the two teams had faced each other only in two opportunities, both were in the 1962 FIFA World Cup qualification phase and won by Spain.\nIn the 14th minute, a mix-up between Sergio Ramos and Andrés Iniesta allowed Khalid Boutaïb to steal possession on the halfway line, burst through on goal and finish through the legs of David de Gea. Iniesta and Diego Costa combined to set up Isco for a close-range finish that tied the scores five minutes later. Boutaïb was clear again in the 25th minute when Morocco took a quick throw-in, but De Gea stopped the ball. Nordin Amrabat, Manuel da Costa and Mbark Boussoufa were all booked in three-minute period before Sergio Busquets headed over the crossbar from Isco's corner. Amrabat's strike from at least 25 yards out bounced off the woodwork in the 55th minute. Isco's looping header dipped under the crossbar, but Romain Saïss made a clearance, Gerard Piqué heading wide from the resulting Isco corner. Youssef En-Nesyri scored home a header to give Morocco the lead. And when Iago Aspas turned home Dani Carvajal's cross from the right after a short corner – the goal given by VAR after a long delay – Spain was tied in the first minute of added time.\nBoutaïb's goal for Morocco was their first goal at the finals since 1998, when Salaheddine Bassir scored in a 3–0 win over Scotland. Ramos made his 16th appearance for Spain at the World Cup, overtaking Xavi as their most capped outfield player in the competition. Spain have failed to win their final group game at a World Cup for the first time since 1982, having won the previous eight such games.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

The top two teams, Uruguay and Russia, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nRussia vs Saudi Arabia.\nThe two teams had met only once, a friendly game in 1993 won by Saudi Arabia 4–2.\nIn the 12th minute, Yury Gazinsky headed the first goal for Russia from a cross from the left before substitute Denis Cheryshev evaded several challenges and smashed home at the near post close to half-time. The tempo slowed and the atmosphere flattened after the restart, giving the whole thing the feel of a friendly match. But substitute Artem Dzyuba illuminated a match of often dubious quality with a precise header from a cross from the right to extend his team's lead just minutes after replacing Fyodor Smolov. As the match moved into injury time, Cheryshev smashed home with a crisp left-foot strike into the top right corner before Aleksandr Golovin curled a free-kick around the wall and into the right of the net.\nAlan Dzagoev limped off with a hamstring injury in the 24th minute. \"Alan Dzagoev damaged the muscles in the back of the thigh,\" Russia said in a brief statement.\nFor the first time in World Cup history, two players – Gazinsky and Cheryshev – scored their first international goals in the opening match. Russia's victory means that the host nation has never lost their opening match in any of the 21 editions of the World Cup (won 16, drew six). Russia (5–0) recorded the second biggest victory by a host nation in their opening match at a World Cup, after Italy v USA in 1934 (7–1); while it is also the second largest victory of any host nation, only behind Italy vs USA at 1934 and Brazil vs Sweden at 1950, both ended 7–1. Russia's Denis Cheryshev became the first substitute to score a goal in the opening match of a World Cup tournament. In this game, Sergei Ignashevich became the oldest player to ever appear in a World Cup match for Russia/USSR (38 years &amp; 335 days old).\nFor Saudi Arabia, this was their second biggest defeat in World Cup, after the 0–8 defeat to Germany in 2002. These losses are also the biggest defeats for any Arab team to have participated in the FIFA World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEgypt vs Uruguay.\nThe two teams had met only once, a friendly game in 2006 won by Uruguay 2–0.\nEgypt frustrated Uruguay with a deep defensive line, staying compact, dealing with danger competently and threatening on the counter-attack to maintain the scoreline goalless, nearing the end of the match. Luis Suárez looked increasingly at a loss but remained prominent in the few opportunities that were created. When he had just the goalkeeper to beat, he dithered too long and allowed Mohamed El Shenawy to muffle the ball at his feet. With three minutes remaining, Edinson Cavani pulled rank over his strike partner over a free kick on the edge of the area. José Giménez headed into the net in the 89th minute as he met Carlos Sánchez's free-kick from the right to give the South Americans a winning start in Russia.\nUruguay won their opening match at the World Cup tournament for the first time since 1970, when they beat Israel 2–0.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRussia vs Egypt.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nSergei Ignashevich headed at Mohamed El Shenawy before Aleksandr Golovin fired wide. Trézéguet then curled just wide from the edge of the box. Russia took the lead when El Shenawy's clearance punch found Roman Zobnin, whose first-time follow up shot spun in off Ahmed Fathy, with VAR confirming that Artem Dzyuba had not fouled his opponent.\nMário Fernandes soon drove into the box before supplying a cut-back form the right for Denis Cheryshev to slot home Russia's second with his left foot. Dzyuba made it 3–0 as he took a lofted ball into the box down on his chest, taking a touch to go past Ali Gabr and finish past El Shenawy with a low shot. Salah won a penalty after he was fouled by Zobnin - although it was only given after a consultation with the video assistant referee as the referee had initially said the offence took place outside the area. Salah scored from the spot to become only the third Egyptian player to score at a World Cup.\nThis is the first time that Russia have won their opening two matches at a World Cup since 1966 (as the Soviet Union). And following with Uruguay's 1–0 victory over Saudi Arabia, Russia, for the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, qualified for the next round.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUruguay vs Saudi Arabia.\nThe two teams had met in two games. Their most recent meeting was a friendly in 2014, ending in a 1–1 draw.\nA left-wing Carlos Sánchez corner was missed by Mohammed Al-Owais, giving Luis Suárez a close-range finish into an unguarded net with his left foot. Fernando Muslera had to tip over a long-range drive from Hattan Bahebri, who then missed a chance in the box. The flat feel of the game continued after the interval with both sides struggling to build tempo in hot conditions at the Rostov Arena. Martín Cáceres headed over in the 68th minute from a Sanchez delivery. Saudi Arabia had plenty of the ball in the closing stages but were unable to score a goal. The result ensured that both Russia and Uruguay would advance to the knockout stage, while Egypt and Saudi Arabia were eliminated at the group stage.\nUruguay have won all four of their World Cup matches against Asian opposition. Suarez became the sixth player to make 100 appearances for his country. He also became the first Uruguay player to score in three World Cups. Uruguay's victory had also helped Russia to qualify for the first time since the fall of the Soviet Union, as Russia had won 3–1 over Egypt earlier.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nUruguay vs Russia.\nThe two teams had met in one previous game, a friendly in 2012, which ended in a 1–1 draw. With Russia formerly playing as the Soviet Union, the sides had faced each other seven times, including two matches at the World Cup, one in the 1962 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by the Soviet Union 2–1, and the other one at the 1970 FIFA World Cup quarter-finals, won by Uruguay 1–0.\nLuis Suárez curled a low free-kick into the bottom-right corner after Yury Gazinsky's foul on Rodrigo Bentancur. Denis Cheryshev struck a half-volley straight at Fernando Muslera. He then found the net at the other end on 23 minutes, though, as his touch diverted Diego Laxalt's first-time effort past Igor Akinfeev. In the 36th minute, Igor Smolnikov picked up his second booking after lunging in on Edinson Cavani, just eight minutes after being carded for a foul on Matías Vecino. Muslera's pass enabled Russia to counter, though Artem Dzyuba sent his close-range effort well wide. In the final minute of normal time, Cavani thumped home the rebound after Akinfeev had kept out Diego Godín's header.\nRussia are the first European side to fail to top their group as the host nation since Spain in 1982, and they are equal with South Africa (2010) in suffering the heaviest defeat as hosts in the group stage – both defeated 3–0 by Uruguay. Uruguay are the first side to win all three of their group games (scoring five goals) without conceding a single goal since Argentina in 1998 (seven goals scored, none conceded). Cavani became just the second player to score a goal in three separate World Cup tournaments for Uruguay after Luis Suárez. Muslera became Uruguay's all-time leading appearance maker at the World Cup (14), overtaking fellow goalkeeper Ladislao Mazurkiewicz. This was also the third time that Uruguay defeated the host nation of tournament, after Brazil in 1950 and South Africa in 2010 (this last also in the group stage).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSaudi Arabia vs Egypt.\nThe two teams had met in six previous matches, the most recent one in the 2007 Pan Arab Games, won by Egypt 2–1.\nMohamed Salah took Abdallah Said's long ball in his stride and then sent a deft lob over the onrushing Yasser Al-Mosailem with his second touch in the 22nd minute. Salah broke Saudi Arabia's offside trap and clipped an effort wide of the right-hand post. Five minutes before the interval Ahmed Fathy was adjudged to have deliberately handled Yasser Al-Shahrani's cross inside the area. Essam El Hadary produced a save to deny Fahad Al-Muwallad, but his celebrations were cut short when a second penalty was awarded for Ali Gabr's tug on Al-Muwallad's shirt. Salman Al-Faraj stepped up this time to fire past the goalkeeper and draw his side level. Egypt substitute Kahraba fired straight at Al-Mosailem late on. Salem Al-Dawsari finished a right-footed volley past El Hadary in the closing stages.\nThis match was the first time Egypt have ever led in a World Cup match, in what was their seventh match in the competition. Al-Faraj's penalty goal for Saudi Arabia, scored after 50 minutes and 36 seconds, was the latest goal scored in the first half of a World Cup game since 1966. El Hadary, at the age of 45 years and 161 days, is the oldest player in the history of the World Cup, breaking the record set by Colombia's Faryd Mondragón in 2014 (43y 3d). Salah became the first African player to score in his first two appearances at the World Cup. Abdullah Otayf completed 110 passes in this match, the most by an Asian player in a World Cup match since 1966. Saudi Arabia remains undefeated when it comes against their Arab rivals in the World Cup, having beaten Morocco 2–1 in 1994 and drew 2–2 to Tunisia in 2006. It was Saudi Arabia's first World Cup win since 1994.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "text": "Group C of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 16 to 26 June 2018. The group consisted of France, Australia, Peru and Denmark. The top two teams, France and Denmark, advanced to the round of 16. France would go on to win the tournament.\nFrance, Denmark and Australia were drawn in the same group again for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nFrance vs Australia.\nThe two teams had met in four previous matches, most recently in a 2013 friendly, a 6–0 France victory.\nAfter a disjointed first half, the game sparked into life shortly after the interval as referee Andrés Cunha initially disallowed a French penalty, but after a call from the VAR, changed his decision and awarded the penalty to France, deciding that Josh Risdon had clipped Antoine Griezmann just inside the area. Griezmann would convert the penalty, which was the first World Cup penalty awarded by VAR. The opener was soon cancelled out just four minutes later by another penalty, Australian midfielder and captain, Mile Jedinak, slotting home after Samuel Umtiti handled the ball in the box, and they looked on course to hold one of the pre-tournament favourites until Paul Pogba's lobbed effort confirmed by goal line technology deflected off Australia full-back Aziz Behich and the crossbar to fall inches over the goal-line.\nThe two penalties were scored in the game between France and Australia were only four minutes, seven seconds apart - the shortest period of time between two penalties being scored by different sides in a World Cup match. Both countries also featured their youngest ever World Cup players in Daniel Arzani at 19 years and 163 days and Kylian Mbappé at 19 years and 178 days.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPeru vs Denmark.\nThe two teams had never met before in a FIFA-sanctioned match, but both teams previously faced each other in an exhibition match at the 1997 U.S. Cup (a 2–1 Denmark victory).\nYoshimar Yotún lashed the ball into Kasper Schmeichel's midriff from 25 yards as Peru began the game and Edison Flores lifted a shot over the crossbar from just outside the box. André Carrillo surged towards the Denmark box in the 13th minute and cut inside to curl a low drive towards the bottom-left corner, only for Schmeichel to pull off a diving save. Denmark began to dominate possession but it was not until the 27th minute that they attempted a shot on goal, Thomas Delaney launching the ball over. Denmark midfielder William Kvist was taken off on a stretcher after a sustaining a blow to the ribs in a challenge with Jefferson Farfán, and then Christian Cueva was brought down in the penalty area by Yussuf Poulsen. The referee pointed to the spot upon reviewing video footage and Cueva blazed over, much to the dismay of Peru's sizable travelling support. Adopting a more adventurous approach after the restart, Denmark were rewarded when Christian Eriksen's precise through-ball allowed Poulsen to open the scoring with a low left foot shot. Peru were denied an immediate equaliser when Denmark goalkeeper Schmeichel produced a one-handed save to deny Flores. Substitute Paolo Guerrero, who was only able to play after a Swiss tribunal lifted a 14-month drugs ban, backheeled a chance wide as Denmark held on.\nDenmark have won three of their four World Cup matches against South American opponents, with the only exception being a 3–2 defeat against Brazil in the 1998 quarter-final.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDenmark vs Australia.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, most recently in a friendly in 2012, with Denmark prevailing 2–0.\nThomas Delaney headed wide from Pione Sisto's cross after just two minutes against Australia. At the other end, Mathew Leckie rose above the Danish defence to head a corner over the bar but Denmark countered and Nicolai Jørgensen's lay-off afforded Christian Eriksen the chance to hit a half-volley past Mathew Ryan and into the top left corner of the net. Sisto shot a 20-yard drive and Jørgensen flashed a close-range header just wide. In the 35th minute, referee consulted VAR and decided that Yussuf Poulsen used his arm to block Leckie's headed shot and awarded the penalty, which Mile Jedinak shot into the bottom right corner of the net. Poulsen had a penalty claim of his own waved away early in the second half after he tumbled to the ground on his way into the Australia box. Kasper Schmeichel failed to collect a looping long ball before Leckie flashed the ball across the face of goal. Daniel Arzani teed up Aaron Mooy for a shot that flew just over the top right corner of Schmeichel's goal from outside the box. Andrew Nabbout left the field with a dislocated shoulder and was replaced by Tomi Juric.\nAfter Ghana, Australia are the second team in World Cup history to score three consecutive goals from the penalty spot. Poulsen is the first player to concede two penalties in a single World Cup since Milan Dudić for Serbia in 2006. Mark Milligan completed 85 passes in this match - a record for an Australian player in a single game at a World Cup tournament. As Poulsen had a yellow card in the previous match, he did not play for Denmark in the next match.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFrance vs Peru.\nThe two teams had met only once, a friendly game in 1982, won by Peru 1–0.\nYoshimar Yotún's shot from the halfway line drifted wide. Raphaël Varane missed with a header before Pedro Gallese saved with his legs to deny Antoine Griezmann after Olivier Giroud found him with a headed pass. Paolo Guerrero shot straight at Hugo Lloris on the turn after Christian Cueva found him in the box. Paul Pogba slid Giroud into the area and when his shot looped over Gallese via a deflection off Christian Ramos, Kylian Mbappé tapped into the empty net from inside the six-yard box. Pedro Aquino clipped the outside of the post with a drive from 25 yards. André Carrillo fired over the crossbar and Jefferson Farfán hit the side-netting. Guerrero missed a late free-kick, and France secured their place in the knockout stages, while Peru were knocked out.\nMbappe became France's youngest ever goalscorer at the World Cup, aged 19 years and 183 days. Mbappe became the first player born after France's 1998 World Cup triumph to score a goal at the finals. Peru are just the second South American side to fail to qualify for the World Cup knockout stages in the last three tournaments - the other being Ecuador in 2014.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDenmark vs France.\nThe two teams had faced each other in 15 matches, including two World Cup group stage matches, in 1998, won by France 2–1, and in 2002, won by Denmark 2–0.\nOlivier Giroud and Raphaël Varane sent early efforts off target. In the 38th minute a strike from Antoine Griezmann was straight at Kasper Schmeichel. Steve Mandanda spilled a long-range Christian Eriksen free-kick before recovering to claim the loose ball ahead of lurking striker Andreas Cornelius. Eriksen shot wide in the 59th minute, although France substitute Nabil Fekir shot at the side-netting with a drive shortly after his introduction for Griezmann. Fekir forced a stop from Schmeichel in the 82nd minute, while Giroud had a late penalty appeal rejected by the referee.\nThis was the only goalless draw of the 2018 World Cup; there were 36 matches played prior to this one, beating the previous record number of matches without a goalless draw to start a World Cup finals, set in 1954, when all 26 matches saw at least one goal.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAustralia vs Peru.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nMile Jedinak was booked for a high boot on Christian Cueva after nine minutes of the first half. At the 18th minute, Paolo Guerrero broke into the penalty area, cut back onto his right foot and swung a deep cross for André Carrillo to lash a volley through Jedinak's legs and into the bottom right corner of the net. Tom Rogic beat three defenders on a run into the penalty area after 26 minutes and saw his shot saved by Pedro Gallese, before Mathew Leckie was denied by an Anderson Santamaría tackle as he slid in on goal. Five minutes into the second half, Guerrero hooked the ball into the far corner of the net beyond Mathew Ryan's left hand. Jedinak's far-post header was saved by Gallese and Trent Sainsbury shot wide from close range, while substitute Tim Cahill had a volley blocked inside the penalty area. Edison Flores crashed a low drive onto the post from the edge of the box in the closing minutes, but the offside flag was raised.\nCarrillo became the first Peru player to score at a World Cup in 36 years. He ended a barren run of 205 minutes since Guillermo La Rosa struck in a 5–1 loss to Poland during Spain 1982. Peru won their first match at the World Cup since a 4–1 win over Iran in 1978. Guerrero - aged 34 years and 176 days - became the third oldest South American scorer at the World Cup, behind only Argentina's Martín Palermo (36 years, 227 days) and Obdulio Varela of Uruguay (36 years 279 days). Cahill became the first Australian to appear at four different World Cup finals. For Australia, they had not won any World Cup matches since their last major victory in 2010 FIFA World Cup, beating Serbia 2–1; and also Australia had not defeated any South American team in the FIFA World Cup, having been beaten by Brazil 0–2 in 2006, drew 0–0 and lost 1–3 to Chile in 1974 and 2014.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "text": "Group D of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 16 to 26 June 2018. The group consisted of Argentina, Iceland, Croatia, and Nigeria. The top two teams, Croatia and Argentina, advanced to the round of 16.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nArgentina vs Iceland.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nDespite stamping their authority on the game's opening stages, Argentina struggled to find space against the Icelandic defence. Argentina then scored in the 19th minute, Sergio Agüero scoring with a powerful left foot shot to the top left corner of the net giving them a 1–0 lead. Alfreð Finnbogason made history by scoring his country's first World Cup goal just four minutes later when he slotted to the net from six yards out after the ball broke to him from six yards out. Argentina then had the chance to go ahead again when Hörður Björgvin Magnússon pushed Maximiliano Meza inside the box after 64 minutes. Hannes Þór Halldórsson dove to his right to deny Lionel Messi a goal. Although Argentina continued to press for a goal, but they were repeatedly denied by the Nordics' defense.\nArgentina failed to win their opening match at a World Cup tournament for the first time since losing to Cameroon in 1990, and it was the first time that they drew their opener in the competition. Argentina have missed their last two penalties taken at a World Cup finals (excluding shootouts), with Ariel Ortega failing to convert against Sweden in 2002 before Messi's effort against Iceland in 2018. The Iceland forward's goal after 23 minutes was the earliest scored for a nation playing in their first World Cup match since Rashidi Yekini netted after 21 minutes for Nigeria against Bulgaria on 21 June 1994.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCroatia vs Nigeria.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nIvan Perišić went closest to hitting the target with an effort from 20 metres after a quarter of an hour, but in the end it was Nigeria's Oghenekaro Etebo who brought joy to the huge Croatian contingent in Kaliningrad, beating his own goalkeeper with the ball going into the left corner of the net following a Luka Modrić corner from the right which had been deflected off Perišić and Mario Mandžukić. Alex Iwobi, after wriggling into space on the left side of the box, he hit a shot directly into a Croatia defender. Ante Rebić fired over from Perišić's left-wing centre, with Odion Ighalo's header recording the match's first shot on target in the 59th minute. William Troost-Ekong was penalised for holding Mandžukić in the penalty area, and Modrić sent Francis Uzoho the wrong way from 12 yards for his first World Cup goal, shooting low to the left corner.\nCroatia have won their opening game of a World Cup for the first time since their debut in the competition in 1998 (3–1 vs Jamaica). Nigeria became the first team in World Cup history to concede two consecutive own goals in the competition, with their last goal shipped in 2014, against France in the last 16, also coming in this manner.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs Croatia.\nThe two teams had met in four matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, an Argentina 1–0 victory.\nIvan Perišić surged into space down the left and shot towards the bottom-right corner, which was tipped around the post by Willy Caballero. A Dejan Lovren block prevented Maximiliano Meza's low strike finding the net and then Marcos Acuña's cross clipped the top of Danijel Subašić's crossbar. Enzo Pérez struck wide from 15 yards. Three minutes later, Mario Mandžukić flashed a header wide of Caballero's right-hand post from six yards. Eight minutes into the second half, Ante Rebić shot a right foot volley past Caballero after the goalkeeper's mishit an attempted chip over his head. Subašić kept out Meza's close-range effort from substitute Gonzalo Higuaín's cutback. With ten minutes remaining Luka Modrić curled in from 20 yards with his right foot to the right corner of the net to score Croatia's second. Ivan Rakitić was fouled by Javier Mascherano – Nicolás Otamendi receiving a booking for appearing to kick the ball towards Rakitić's head as tempers flared – and crashed the resulting free-kick against the crossbar. Rakitić in the 91st minute, though, slotted home from the centre of the box after his initial shot deflected off Caballero and found Mateo Kovačić who passed it back to Rakitić from the left. With their second win in a row, Croatia advanced to the round of 16 for the first time since 1998, having been eliminated in 2002, 2006 and 2014 editions.\nThis was Croatia's first victory in five attempts against a South American team at the World Cup, having lost the previous four. This was Argentina's heaviest defeat in the first-round group stage of a World Cup since losing 6–1 to Czechoslovakia in 1958. Argentina failed to win either of their opening two group stage matches for the first time since 1974.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNigeria vs Iceland.\nThe two teams had met only once, in a friendly game in 1981, won by Iceland 3–0.\nGylfi Sigurðsson shot a sixth-minute chance straight at Francis Uzoho. In the last minute of the first half, Alfreð Finnbogason was unable to get a decisive touch on Sigurðsson's free-kick delivered from the right wing. In the 49th minute, Victor Moses' cross was collected by Ahmed Musa, who first controlled it in the air with his right foot before scoring on the half-volley powerfully to the net. Hannes Þór Halldórsson tipped over a deflected drive from Wilfred Ndidi. In the 75th minute, fed by Kenneth Omeruo, Musa burst clear in the left channel, cut inside and rounded Halldórsson before scoring with his right foot. A late VAR review spotted that substitute Tyronne Ebuehi had tripped Finnbogason, with Sigurðsson's spot-kick effort clearing the crossbar.\nIceland are the third World Cup debutants from Europe to have faced Nigeria at the tournament, and on every occasion Nigeria have emerged victorious, following victories against Greece (2–0) in 1994 and Bosnia and Herzegovina (1–0) in 2014. Uzoho is the second youngest goalkeeper to keep a clean sheet in a World Cup match (19 years, 237 days), behind only Li Chan-myung in North Korea's 1–0 win over Italy in July 1966 (19 years, 198 days). This is Nigeria's first victory in a World Cup game by a margin of more than one goal since they beat Greece 2–0 in 1994 at their first World Cup tournament. This was Iceland's first group stage's defeat in any big tournament.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nNigeria vs Argentina.\nThe two teams had met in eight matches, including four games at FIFA World Cup group stages, in 1994, 2002, 2010 and 2014, all won by Argentina.\nAhmed Musa narrowly cleared the crossbar in the early minutes of the game. In the 14th minute, Lionel Messi controlled the ball from a pass over the top from Éver Banega on his thigh and his left boot before shooting a right-footed drive past Francis Uzoho from the right. Leon Balogun brought Ángel Di María down 25 yards from goal, but Uzoho tipped Messi's free kick to his left-hand post. In the second half, Leon Balogun was held in the penalty area by Javier Mascherano after a corner form the left, and Victor Moses scored from the resulting penalty to equalize for Nigeria, shooting low to the right with the goalkeeper diving the other way. After a series of defensive fouls in each penalty area that went uncalled despite a VAR check for a handball by Marcos Rojo, Oghenekaro Etebo narrowly missed from a long-range free kick. Gabriel Mercado raided down the right and bent a cross into the penalty area, with Marcos Rojo, who scored the decisive goal against Nigeria four years ago in Brazil, once again converting, as he tucked home a low right-footed volley to give Argentina the win and see them advance to the knockout stage.\nMessi's strike brought up the century for goals at Russia 2018. He also joined Diego Maradona and Gabriel Batistuta in becoming the third Argentina player to score in three World Cups.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIceland vs Croatia.\nThe two teams had met in six matches, most recently in 2017 for the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, which ended in a 1–0 Iceland victory.\nHörður Magnússon headed wide from Jóhann Guðmundsson's outswinging corner. Alfreð Finnbogason shot wide from the edge of the area. Birkir Bjarnason pounced from a corner, but Lovre Kalinić made a save from Aron Gunnarsson's curling effort. At the restart, Milan Badelj's strike clattered off the crossbar. Badelj got his goal when he reacted to a loose ball in the Iceland box and hammered home from close range. Sverrir Ingason's header rebounded back off the bar. Dejan Lovren's handball though enabled Gylfi Sigurðsson to score from the spot in the 76th minute. Badelj provided a throughball and, having outpaced his marker, Ivan Perišić lashed home to score the winner.\nCroatia topped a world finals group for the first time in their history, and because of Croatia's victory, Argentina also qualified. With the defeat, Iceland stood bottom in the group with a single point and were eliminated.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "text": "Group E of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 17 to 27 June 2018. The group consisted of Brazil, Switzerland, Costa Rica, and Serbia. The top two teams, Brazil and Switzerland, advanced to the round of 16.\nBrazil, Serbia and Switzerland played in the same group at the following FIFA World Cup.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nCosta Rica vs Serbia.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nBoth defences were tested in the opening moments - Aleksandar Mitrović seeing an effort hooked off the line before Giancarlo González headed straight at Vladimir Stojković at the other end. The Serbian team was almost punished for their lack of penetration when Francisco Calvo dragged a strike wide as Costa Rica enjoyed a short spell of possession just before the break. Aleksandar Kolarov’s left-footed free kick from the right flew into the top right corner. Serbia's Nemanja Matić, meanwhile, was involved in a confrontation with a member of the Costa Rica coaching staff in injury time as he tried to retrieve the ball after it went out of play.\nSerbia have won their opening game at a World Cup tournament for the first time since 1998, when they did so as Yugoslavia against Iran (1–0). Costa Rica suffered their first defeat at the World Cup since 2006 (1–2 v Poland), ending a run of five games unbeaten in the competition (W2 D3). Kolarov's strike was the first direct free-kick scored by a Serbia/Yugoslavia player at a World Cup tournament since 1998, when Siniša Mihajlović netted against Iran. Kolarov's goal for Serbia was the third direct free-kick scored at this year's World Cup (after Russia's Aleksandr Golovin and Portugal's Cristiano Ronaldo), which is already as many as there were in the entire 2014 tournament in Brazil.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBrazil vs Switzerland.\nThe two teams had met in eight matches, including one game at the 1950 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 2–2 draw.\nPaulinho's close-range effort forced Yann Sommer into a save. The first goal was scored shortly after when Philippe Coutinho scored from outside the penalty area with a right foot shot. Brazil also came close before the break as Thiago Silva headed inches over the crossbar. Five minutes into the second half, Steven Zuber equalised with a controversial header after a corner from the right decided by VAR review when he appeared to push Miranda in the back. More controversy was caused in the 73rd minute, after Gabriel Jesus was denied a penalty after being hacked down by Manuel Akanji in the penalty area. Brazil came close several times during the closing minutes, but Neymar, Roberto Firmino, and Miranda were unable to garner goals.\nBrazil have failed to win any of their last three World Cup matches (D1 L2), their worst winless run since June 1978, when they went four games without a win. Valon Behrami is the first Switzerland player in history to appear at four World Cups. Brazil failed to win their opening match at the World Cup for the first time since 1978, when they drew 1–1 with Sweden.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBrazil vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had met in ten matches, including two games at the FIFA World Cup's group stages, in 1990 and 2002, with both ending in a victory for Brazil's (1–0 and 5–2, respectively).\nCelso Borges shot an effort wide of the target from a Cristian Gamboa cutback after 13 minutes. Gabriel Jesus shot into the back of the net from an offside position in the 25th minute. Marcelo shot a low drive five minutes from the break, which Keylor Navas stopped. After the break, Jesus headed against the crossbar before Navas diverted Philippe Coutinho's follow-up wide. Neymar curled around the right-hand post from 18 yards in the 72nd minute, before the officials arrived at the correct decision via VAR to deny him a penalty. Coutinho gave Brazil the lead in the 91st minute, when he burst into the box to get on the end of a Roberto Firmino nod down and a touch from Jesus before poking the ball low to the net. Neymar then tapped home Douglas Costa's chipped cross from the right from close range deeper into the stoppage time.\nNeymar's strike seven minutes into stoppage time was the latest ever at a World Cup in regular time. This was Brazil's first World Cup victory thanks to a goal scored in the 90th minute. Costa Rica were knocked out of the tournament after this game for the first time since 2006, with a game to play. In addition, with Germany having won the all-time record of most World Cup goals by any team with 224 goals after their win against Argentina in the final of the previous World Cup, Neymar's goal successfully tied up the record with Germany.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSerbia vs Switzerland.\nThe two teams had never met. Playing as Yugoslavia, the two teams met 13 times, including one game at the 1950 FIFA World Cup group stage, a 3–0 victory for Yugoslavia.\nDušan Tadić checked back onto his left foot to send in a cross from the right that Aleksandar Mitrović met with a header into the left side of the net. Blerim Džemaili shot wide from inside the penalty area. Serbia pressed and Sergej Milinković-Savić shot narrowly wide with a rising 20-yard drive. With almost half an hour played Steven Zuber passed the ball to Džemaili who drew a one-handed save from Vladimir Stojković down to the goalkeeper's right. After 52 minutes, Xherdan Shaqiri's shot rebounded back to Granit Xhaka and the midfielder curled a right-footed shot into the far corner of the net from 25 yards. Shaqiri hit the frame of the goal with a bending effort from the right. Switzerland substitute Mario Gavranović was flagged offside as he hit the side-netting. And, in the final minute of normal time, Gavranović played a throughball to Shaqiri, who outpaced Duško Tošić and ran from near the half-way line into the box before nutmegging Stojković with a low finish from the left.\nStephan Lichtsteiner made his ninth World Cup appearance for Switzerland in this game, breaking the national record held by Charles Antenen since 1962.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSerbia vs Brazil.\nThe two teams had met once, a 2014 friendly won by Brazil 1–0. Playing as Yugoslavia, the two teams met 18 times, including four times at FIFA World Cup's group stages in 1930, 1950, 1954 and 1974, with one victory each and two draws.\nMarcelo was replaced with Filipe Luís in the 10th minute, due to a back spasm. Gabriel Jesus created a chance for Neymar, whose cross-goal strike was pushed away by Vladimir Stojković. Jesus cut inside of Miloš Veljković and saw his shot blocked behind by Nikola Milenković. In the 36th minute, Paulinho raced between two defenders and poked Philippe Coutinho's delivery beyond the onrushing Stojković. Neymar had a low drive kept out by Stojković at the near post five minutes into the second period. Aleksandar Mitrović headed a cross from Antonio Rukavina straight at the feet of the keeper in the 65th minute. Thiago Silva headed home at the near post from Neymar's left-wing corner in the 68th minute.\nBrazil have qualified from the group stage of the World Cup for the 13th consecutive tournament, a run stretching back to 1970. Brazil have now won back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 2010, when they won their opening two group matches. For Serbia, this was the second consecutive elimination from the group stage in their World Cup history as an independent nation. Also, after Germany's previous match with Sweden where Germany initially managed to restore the all-time record of World Cup goals by any team with 226 goals, just as Brazil have managed to tie up the record of 224 goals after Neymar's goal in the match against Costa Rica, they have done it again in this match with Thiago Silva's goal that has now brought them to 226 goals with Germany.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSwitzerland vs Costa Rica.\nThe two teams had faced each other twice, most recently in a 2010 friendly won by Costa Rica 1–0.\nTwo Costa Rican shots hit the woodwork, one of which was tipped on to the post by Sommer, before Stephan Lichtsteiner's right-wing cross was headed back across goal by Breel Embolo, and the unmarked Blerim Džemaili lashed home from eight yards. Keylor Navas blocked Embolo's effort at his near post, before Kendall Waston headed Joel Campbell's outswinging corner from six yards after 56 minutes. Josip Drmić slotted into the bottom corner from Denis Zakaria's low cross. Switzerland then hit the frame of the goal in the 78th minute. Referee awarded a spot-kick after Bryan Ruiz had been bundled over in the area, only for the decision to be reversed after replays showed that he had strayed into an offside position when he received the ball. Ruiz did get a chance from the spot in the third minute of stoppage time when Campbell was felled in the box, his penalty hit the bar and then bounced in the net off of Yann Sommer's head as an own goal.\nWaston's goal for Costa Rica was their first in 424 minutes of play in World Cup matches (not including penalty shootouts), with their previous goal scored by Ruiz in the last 16 of the 2014 tournament against Greece. Switzerland have avoided defeat in each of their three group stage matches at the World Cup for the first time since 2006. Costa Rica became the last side to score a goal at Russia 2018. Sommer is just the third goalkeeper to score an own goal at the World Cup, after Honduras' Noel Valladares against France in 2014 and Spain's Andoni Zubizarreta against Nigeria in 1998.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "title": "2018 FIFA World Cup Group F",
        "text": "Group F of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 17 to 27 June 2018. The group consisted of Germany, Mexico, Sweden, and South Korea. Sweden and Mexico were the top two teams that advanced to the round of 16. The incumbent World Cup champions, Germany, placed last, making it the first time since 1938 that Germany did not advance beyond the first round, and the first time ever, the group stage. The early German exit was \"greeted with shock in newspapers around the world\".\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nGermany vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had faced each other 11 times, including three FIFA World Cup games all of which were German victories: 6–0 in 1978 (first group stage), 2–1 in 1998 (round of 16), but a 1986 quarter-final game being the most significant, which ended with a German penalty shoot-out victory.\nTimo Werner fired a warning shot across the face of Guillermo Ochoa's goal during the first minutes of the match. Héctor Moreno headed straight at Manuel Neuer from their clearest opening. Javier Hernández's one-two with Andrés Guardado allowed him to spin away from Mats Hummels just inside the Germany half and feed Hirving Lozano down the left. Lozano then cut inside the resistance offered by the back-tracking Mesut Özil to crash a low right foot shot inside Neuer's right post. However, two minutes later, Toni Kroos's free-kick arrowed towards the top corner. Ochoa denied the midfielder's shot, pushing the ball against the crossbar. Near the end Joshua Kimmich and Werner came close to scoring, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Julian Brandt had one final chance to equalize in the 89th minute, but he hit the post from outside the box. \nThis defeat represented the first time that Germany had lost the opening game in defence of their trophy. They beat Argentina 3–1 in 1958, drew 0–0 with Poland in 1978, and defeated Bolivia 1–0 in 1994. Germany lost their opening match at a World Cup for only the second time, having done so in 1982, against Algeria. This is the third consecutive World Cup in which the reigning champion has failed to win their opening match – Italy drew 1–1 with Paraguay in 2010, while Spain lost 5–1 against the Netherlands in 2014; and also the fourth champions failed to win their opening match, as France lost 0–1 to Senegal at the 2002 FIFA World Cup (all of whom had been knocked out at the group stage). Germany had 26 shots, the most by a side without scoring in a World Cup fixture since 2006 (Portugal v England, 29 shots in a 0–0 draw). Conversely, Mexico beat Germany for only the second time – their last win against them came in a friendly in June 1985. However, Mexico's victory over Germany marked the first time a team from the CONCACAF region defeated Germany in the World Cup. Additionally, Mexico became the first team from the Americas to defeat Germany at a World Cup in almost 16 years – the last time Germany lost to either a North- or South-American team was at the 2002 final against Brazil. Rafael Márquez featured in his fifth World Cup finals, becoming just the third player to achieve this feat – along with Mexico's Antonio Carbajal and Germany's Lothar Matthäus.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSweden vs South Korea.\nThe two teams had faced each other four times, most recently in 2005, a 2–2 draw in a friendly game.\nSweden's defence was tested by a South Korean attack in the early stages. Andreas Granqvist was denied a shot at goal by a last-ditch interception by Kim Young-gwon. Marcus Berg was close to score midway through the first half but his close range shot was beaten away by Jo Hyeon-woo, while South Korea did not manage a single shot on target. Jo also saved from Ola Toivonen's header following a free-kick. In the start to the second half, both sides exchanged chances within the first six minutes. There was a short delay for Kim Min-woo's foul on Viktor Claesson to be analysed on video and for the referee to point to the spot but it did not affect Granqvist, who sent Jo the wrong way. Hwang Hee-chan spurned a glorious opportunity late on, heading wide from 10 yards out, as Sweden ultimately held on for a precious three points.\nThis was Sweden's first win in their opening match at a World Cup since beating Mexico 3–0 as hosts in 1958. South Korea lost their opening match at a World Cup for the first time since 1998 when they lost 3–1 against Mexico. Sweden's goal was the first they had scored in 402 minutes of international football.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Mexico.\nThe two teams had met in 12 matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, won by Mexico 3–1. The match was attended by the President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in.\nIn the 12th minute, Hirving Lozano made a block to deny Lee Yong. Nine minutes later, Son Heung-min shot a low drive which Héctor Moreno helped to keep out. Jang Hyun-soo handled Andrés Guardado's cross and the referee awarded a penalty, Carlos Vela stepped up and sent Jo Hyeon-woo the wrong way. Two minutes later, Miguel Layún lashed his effort over from close range. South Korea wanted a penalty of their own after the restart when Moon Seon-min's strike clipped Carlos Salcedo's arm, but the referee waved away their appeals. Jo lunged to his right to tip Javier Hernández's shot wide. Lozano drove into space, Vela drew away to the right as the ball went left to Hernández, who checked back and clipped low past Jo. In the third minute of stoppage time, Son struck from 20-yards into the top-left corner.\nBefore Son's goal, South Korea had gone 288 minutes without scoring at the World Cup, their longest ever such drought. Hernández scored his 50th goal for Mexico, becoming the inaugural player of the Mexico national team to reach that milestone. Mexico has won consecutive matches at the World Cup starting with their inaugural achievement at the 2002 World Cup. Hernández is the third player to score at three World Cups, preceded by Mexico's Cuauhtémoc Blanco and Rafael Márquez.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGermany vs Sweden.\nThe two teams had met in 36 previous matches, including four FIFA World Cup games, the latest of these being a 2–0 Germany win in the 2006 World Cup round of 16.\nJulian Draxler had a shot blocked from close range before he toe-poked a left-footed effort narrowly wide from a tight angle soon after. Sebastian Rudy left the field with a bloody nose after a collision with Ola Toivonen moments before he burst into the box to control a Viktor Claesson cross on his chest and lift his shot over Manuel Neuer into the far corner of the net. Three minutes into the second half, Germany drew level when Timo Werner's cross found Marco Reus, who met it with his knee and turned the ball into the bottom corner of the net. With just under 10 minutes left, Jérôme Boateng was dismissed after picking up a second yellow card for a tackle on Marcus Berg, and Neuer then made a one-handed save to deny substitute John Guidetti from a downward header. Toni Kroos tapped a free-kick short to Reus before sweeping the return pass into the top right corner from left of the penalty area with his right foot.\nKroos' goal in (94.39) is the latest winner ever scored on the World Cup stage. The previous record belonged to Francesco Totti, who found the net late on (94.26) against Australia in 2006. Germany came from behind at half-time to win a World Cup match for the first time since 1974 – which was also against Sweden (0–1 at HT, won 4–2). Sweden have lost a World Cup group-stage match for the first time since June 1990, when they lost to Costa Rica – this defeat ends a run of 10 group games unbeaten. Boateng is the first player to be sent off at the World Cup for Germany since Miroslav Klose in 2010 against Serbia.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSouth Korea vs Germany.\nThe two teams had faced each other three times, including two FIFA World Cup games, one at the 2002 FIFA World Cup semi-finals, which ended with a 1–0 victory for Germany, and one at the 1994 FIFA World Cup group stage, a Germany 3–2 victory. Despite South Korea's two previous losses, they were not eliminated just yet. For South Korea to have any chance of advancing, Mexico would have to defeat Sweden in their match that same day, and South Korea would then have to defeat Germany by at least two goals, a feat predicted to be highly improbable going in, with the South Korean coach before the game predicting that it had a \"one percent\" chance of happening.\nSon Heung-min shot wide from the edge of the penalty area before Marco Reus shot one towards goal at the other end only to see it blocked. Leon Goretzka drew a one-handed save from Jo Hyeon-woo with a header from the middle of the penalty area, the South Korean goalkeeper diving to his right and pushing the ball away at full stretch. Two minutes into the second-half's stoppage time, Son's corner from the left reached Kim Young-gwon at the far post who scored into the right corner from six yards out with his left foot, the offside decision that followed was overruled by a VAR decision. Ju Se-jong won the ball off Manuel Neuer who had been at the other end of the pitch in order to join the German attack, thus leaving the goal undefended, and hit a long ball to Son, who ran onto the ball and tapped into an empty net from close range to score the second.\nHad Mexico defeated Sweden in their final group stage match that same day, a South Korean victory over Germany by at least two goals would have advanced South Korea to the round of 16 based on goal differential, at the expense of Sweden. However, since Sweden defeated Mexico 3–0, the South Koreans were eliminated despite their 2–0 victory over Germany. This marked the second time that South Korea failed to qualify for the knockout stage in consecutive World Cups, having been eliminated in the group stage at the previous tournament and in four consecutive World Cups from 1986 to 1998.\nGermany were the fourth defending champions to be eliminated from the group stage at the World Cup in the last five tournaments, following France in 2002, Italy in 2010, and Spain in 2014; and since the new millennium, all champions eliminated in the group stage had been UEFA members. This was only the second time that Germany had been eliminated from the first round at the World Cup, having done so in 1938, while also being the first time since then that Germany failed to finish among the best eight teams of the tournament. However, this was the first time it happened after the first round was converted back to a group stage format in 1950. This was Germany's first ever defeat against an Asian nation in a World Cup match in what was their sixth such match. This was South Korea's first victory (and clean sheet) at the World Cup since their 2–0 win over Greece in 2010. Son's goal for South Korea (95:52) was the latest goal Germany had ever conceded in a 90-minute World Cup match. This was also the first time Germany finished bottom in the World Cup's group stage, one of the worst performances in their history; having been eliminated from the group stage of UEFA Euro 2000 and 2004. South Korea's win also meant that Australia was the only team from the Asian Football Confederation that failed to win a game in their 2018 World Cup campaign.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMexico vs Sweden.\nThe two teams had met in nine previous matches, including a 1958 FIFA World Cup group stage match won by Sweden 3–0.\nSweden got the breakthrough five minutes into the second half, Ludwig Augustinsson volleyed past Guillermo Ochoa when Viktor Claesson's mishit sat him up. The referee pointed to the spot when Héctor Moreno slid in on Marcus Berg and Andreas Granqvist shot into the top-left corner. In the 74th minute, substitute Isaac Thelin flicked on a long throw-in before Edson Álvarez accidentally hit the ball into his own net with his left thigh. \nMexico qualify for the knockout stages for the seventh consecutive World Cup despite this defeat, thanks to South Korea's 2–0 victory over Germany. This was Sweden's biggest win in a World Cup match since they defeated Bulgaria 4–0 in 1994 in the third-place play-off match. Granqvist became the first Swedish player to score two or more goals in a single World Cup tournament since Henrik Larsson in 2002. This was Mexico's worst defeat at the World Cup since they were beaten 6–0 by Germany in 1978. Jesús Gallardo was shown a yellow card after just 15 seconds in this game – the quickest anyone has ever been booked in the World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "text": "Group G of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 18 to 28 June 2018. The group consisted of Belgium, Panama, Tunisia, and England. The top two teams, Belgium and England, advanced to the round of 16, and went on to meet each other again in the third-place play-off.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nBelgium vs Panama.\nThe two teams had never met before this World Cup match.\nYannick Carrasco and Dries Mertens forced early saves from goalkeeper Jaime Penedo. Eden Hazard hit the side-netting after pouncing on a loose backpass from Román Torres. Hazard fired wide in the 26th minute and was left hobbling by heavy challenges from Michael Amir Murillo and Torres. Hazard then shook off the blows and forced Penedo into a save with his legs. After a goalless first half, Mertens steered in a right-foot volley from the right of the penalty area to give Belgium the lead. Kevin De Bruyne almost doubled the lead but narrowly missed the target with a 25-yard free-kick that curled away from Penedo's right-hand post. Belgium doubled their lead in the 69th minute after Romelu Lukaku scored with a diving header after a cross from the left by Kevin De Bruyne. Lukaku then added a third with a chipped finish from the left of the penalty area after a through ball from Hazard.\nBelgium's last victory by two goals or more at the FIFA World Cup was a 3–1 defeat of Uruguay in 1990. It also matched their best win in World Cup history, along with a 3–0 victory over El Salvador in 1970.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nTunisia vs England.\nThe two teams had met in two matches, including one game at the 1998 FIFA World Cup group stage, an England 2–0 victory.\nEngland scored in the 11th minute when Mouez Hassen stopped a John Stones' header from a corner from the left, but could not save a Harry Kane follow-up from close range. Hassen was substituted four minutes later for Farouk Ben Mustapha due to an injury earlier in the game, after he had a collision with Jesse Lingard. Lingard then mishit a volley from Ashley Young's cross to the far post. After 10 minutes, Ferjani Sassi equalised from the penalty spot after Kyle Walker was penalised for an elbow on Fakhreddine Ben Youssef. Kane had an appeal for a penalty waved away within five minutes of the restart as he was seemingly impeded by a pair of Tunisia players at a corner. In the additional time, Harry Maguire flicked a Kieran Trippier corner from the right into the path of Kane, who headed it inside the goal after being left free at the back post.\nEngland scored more than once for the first time in 10 World Cup matches, since a 2–2 draw against Sweden in 2006. Kane became the first England player to score a brace in a World Cup match since Gary Lineker against Cameroon in 1990.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBelgium vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had faced each other in three matches, including one game at the 2002 FIFA World Cup group stage, which ended in a 1–1 draw.\nJust 6 minutes into the game, Syam Ben Youssef's late challenge on Eden Hazard was deemed, with the use of VAR, to have been just inside the area and he stepped up to score the penalty into the bottom-left corner. Ten minutes later, Dries Mertens won possession just inside the Tunisia half before driving forward and passing the ball to Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku then shot a low strike across Farouk Ben Mustapha into the bottom-right corner. Wahbi Khazri's free-kick from the left was met by Dylan Bronn, who flashed a header past Thibaut Courtois. Thomas Meunier found Lukaku inside the area, which he clipped over the onrushing Mustapha. Toby Alderweireld's long pass from defence was taken on the chest by Hazard, who then rounded Mustapha to stroke into an empty net. Michy Batshuayi met Youri Tielemans' cross at the back post with a controlled half-volley to score Belgium's 5th. Khazri scored deep into stoppage time after a swivel in the box.\nLukaku became the first player since Diego Maradona to score back-to-back braces in consecutive world cup games. Hazard's penalty was Belgium's second quickest goal in a World Cup match (5:59), behind only Léopold Anoul's goal against England in 1954, in the fifth minute. For Tunisia, it has registered as their worst defeat ever in their World Cup history.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEngland vs Panama.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nJohn Stones headed in from Kieran Trippier's corner to open the scoring. Harry Kane converted a penalty to make it 2–0 following a foul on Jesse Lingard, who was next to find the net with a curling finish with his right foot from the edge of the area. Stones nodded home the rebound after goalkeeper Jaime Penedo had kept out Raheem Sterling's close-range header. Kane scored his second penalty of the match in the stoppage time of first half, hammering the ball into Penedo's top right corner after referee had spotted a foul on the forward by Fidel Escobar. Kane completed his hat-trick when a deflected shot by Ruben Loftus-Cheek flicked off from his ankle. Felipe Baloy scored Panama's first-ever World Cup goal, with a half-volley from a Ricardo Ávila free-kick. The result ensured that both England and Belgium would advance to the knockout stage, while Tunisia and Panama would be eliminated at the group stage.\nGary Lineker was the last England player before Kane to notch more than one goal in consecutive World Cup matches, 32 years ago. At Mexico 1986, Lineker followed up a hat-trick against Poland with a brace against Paraguay. This was England's biggest win at a major tournament. Stones became the first England defender to score two goals in a World Cup match. Kane is the first player to score at least twice in both of his first two World Cup appearances since Grzegorz Lato of Poland in 1974. Kane is the third England player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup match, after Geoff Hurst against Germany in the 1966 final and Gary Lineker against Poland in 1986.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nEngland vs Belgium.\nThe two teams had met in 21 matches, including two matches at the World Cup, one round of 16 game at the 1990 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 1–0 victory for England, and one group stage game at the 1954 FIFA World Cup which ended in a 4–4 draw. Both teams had already guaranteed to advance to the last 16 before kick off, with the winner securing top spot in the group.\nBoth teams fielded significantly altered line-ups before the game, with media outlets stating that a loss could potentially become beneficial, as the winner would be in the half of the draw with the 4 of the top 7 sides in the world.\nJordan Pickford kept out a long-range drive from Youri Tielemans before the goalkeeper was rescued by Gary Cahill's goal-line clearance after the ball squirmed out of his grasp. In the 51st minute, Adnan Januzaj cut in from the right and hit a left foot shot into the top left corner of the net. Jamie Vardy sent Marcus Rashford through on goal in the 66th minute, but the striker's effort was turned wide of the post by a touch from Thibaut Courtois.\nThis 1–0 victory ended Belgium's 82-year winless run against England which dates back to a friendly played in Brussels on 9 May 1936. The scoreline was 3–2 on that occasion. This is the first World Cup match (other than 0–0 draws) in which England failed to score since a 1–0 loss to Portugal in 1986.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPanama vs Tunisia.\nThe two teams had never met before. Both teams had already been eliminated from the tournament before the match.\nPanama took the lead in the 33rd minute, after a José Rodríguez shot from outside the penalty area took a deflection off Yassine Meriah and nestle in the back of the net. In the 51st minute, Naïm Sliti found Wahbi Khazri down the right and the latter's low cross was converted by Fakhreddine Ben Youssef just six yards out. At the 66 minute mark, Khazri finished off a cross from the left by Oussama Haddadi from close range at the back post.\nTunisia won a World Cup match after 40 years, since their 3–1 victory over Mexico in 1978. Panama became the first nation since Serbia &amp; Montenegro and Togo in 2006 to lose each of their first three World Cup games. Panama's goal means this is the first World Cup tournament in which every side has scored at least two goals in the competition. Meriah's own goal was the 50th in World Cup history.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "title": "2018 FIFA World Cup Group H",
        "text": "Group H of the 2018 FIFA World Cup took place from 19 to 28 June 2018. The group consisted of Poland, Senegal, Colombia, and Japan. The top two teams, Colombia and Japan, advanced to the round of 16. For the first time in World Cup history, the \"fair play\" rule was invoked to break a tie. Japan and Senegal finished with identical scores and goal differences to tie for second behind Colombia. Japan were awarded the place in the round of 16 based on receiving fewer yellow cards in their three matches.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nIn the round of 16:\nMatches.\nAll times listed are local time.\nColombia vs Japan.\nThe two teams had met in three previous matches, most recently in a 2014 FIFA World Cup group stage game, won by Colombia 4–1.\nIn the third minute, Carlos Sánchez blocked Shinji Kagawa's 20-yard shot with his arm, denying an obvious goal scoring opportunity and the referee pointed to the penalty spot before showing the midfielder a straight red card. After lengthy protests, Sánchez eventually left the field and Kagawa slotted the penalty into the bottom right corner of the net. José Pékerman then replaced Juan Cuadrado with Wílmar Barrios at the half-hour mark, and an equaliser arrived nine minutes later, from a Juan Fernando Quintero free kick, shot low under the jumping wall which the goalkeeper failed to keep out. In the second half, David Ospina dived full length to his left to stop Takashi Inui's curling 20-yard shot. Yuya Osako then headed the ball into the far corner of the net from a Keisuke Honda corner from the left. With 13 minutes left, James Rodríguez's strike from inside the box was turned over the crossbar by the outstretched leg of Osako.\nQuintero became the first Colombian player in history to score at two World Cups. Japan became the first Asian team to beat a side from South America in the competition's history. Honda became the first player from an Asian nation to provide an assist in three different World Cup tournaments since 1966. Eiji Kawashima (35 years, 91 days) became the oldest player to appear for Japan in a World Cup finals match.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPoland vs Senegal.\nThe two teams had never met before.\nSenegal had the first clear chance in the 18th minute, M'Baye Niang dragging an effort wide after a break. Senegal took the lead when Idrissa Gueye's 20-yard shot took a huge deflection off Thiago Cionek to flick in Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczęsny's goal and give Senegal the lead. Robert Lewandowski stepped up to float a 25-yard free-kick over the wall, Khadim N'Diaye dived to turn the ball away. Grzegorz Krychowiak hooked a high ball back towards his own goal from inside the Senegal half and with Szczesny attempting to intercept by coming out of his penalty area, Niang knocked the ball past him before side footing into an unguarded goal. Arkadiusz Milik slotted a Łukasz Piszczek cross wide at the near post. Dawid Kownacki's headed attempt was saved late on by N'Diaye but the goalkeeper was beaten by Krychowiak's header with five minutes to go after a free kick from the right.\nCionek became the first Polish player to score an own goal in a World Cup match. Cionek's own goal was only the second time an African nation has benefited from an own goal in a World Cup match, after Andoni Zubizarreta for Spain against Nigeria in 1998. Senegal continued their impressive undefeated run in an opening World Cup match, having beaten France 1–0 in 2002.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nJapan vs Senegal.\nThe two teams had faced each other three times, most recently in a friendly in 2003, won by Senegal 1–0.\nSenegal took the lead in the 11th minute when Japanese goalkeeper Eiji Kawashima spilled a Youssouf Sabaly shot into the path of Sadio Mané, who hit the ball in from close range. Japan responded in the 34th minute when Yuto Nagatomo received a ball over the top and sent it to Takashi Inui, who curled a shot into the bottom corner past the Senegalese defenders. Yuya Osako missed a close chance in front of the Senegal net and Inui's shot struck the crossbar, before Senegal retook the lead in the 71st minute, when Moussa Wagué finished a low Sabaly cross into the top corner. Japan equalised again just seven minutes later, when Senegal goalkeeper Khadim N'Diaye failed to collect an Osako cross, leading to Inui sending the ball to Japanese substitute Keisuke Honda, who finished at the near post.\nWagué became the youngest African goalscorer at a World Cup, at the age of 19 years and 268 days. With his goal, Honda became the first Japanese player to score at three different World Cups, as well as the top scoring Asian player in World Cup history with four goals. Japan equalled their best points tally of four after two group games at a World Cup, just as they did as co-hosts in 2002.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPoland vs Colombia.\nThe two teams had met in five matches, most recently in a 2006 friendly, won by Colombia 2–1.\nAbel Aguilar was taken from the field on a stretcher in the 32nd minute and was replaced by Mateus Uribe. Shortly after, a cross by James Rodríguez from the right was met by the head of Yerry Mina, who lost his marker to head over Wojciech Szczęsny's outstretched arms and into the net. Juan Fernando Quintero fired wide from 25 yards at the start of the second half. Juan Cuadrado then squared to Radamel Falcao on the edge of the box who lifted his shot well over the crossbar. In the 58th minute, Robert Lewandowski controlled a long pass only to shoot straight into David Ospina's midriff as Poland attempted their first shot on target of the game. Quintero's slide-rule pass presented Falcao with a one-on-one situation and he guided the ball past Szczęsny with the outside of his right foot to double his side's lead. With 15 minutes left on the clock, James' pass from the left found Cuadrado in space through the middle and he took a touch before finishing it into the bottom-right corner of the net.\nPoland were the first European nation to be eliminated from the 2018 World Cup. Including Colombia's victory against Poland, there were 14 World Cup goals scored on 24 June 2018 - the most on a single day of action in the competition (maximum 3 games) since 10 June 1990 (also 14).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nJapan vs Poland.\nThe two teams had met twice, most recently in a friendly game in 2002, won by Japan 2–0.\nYoshinori Muto's drive forced Łukasz Fabiański to parry, before the goalkeeper smothered a Gōtoku Sakai effort. Eiji Kawashima scooped Kamil Grosicki's header clear. With just over half an hour remaining, Rafał Kurzawa's free-kick from the left picked out Jan Bednarek, who volleyed it into the net from six yards out. Maya Yoshida headed well wide from a left-wing corner. Robert Lewandowski steered Grosicki's pin-point pass over the top.\nPoland beat Japan for the first time in an official match, having defeated Japan in four unofficial matches. Poland won each of their 14 games in which they scored first in World Cup finals. Poland kept a clean sheet at the World Cup for the first time since winning 1–0 against Portugal in 1986. On another side, since the new millennia, Poland had repeated their poor performances in 2002 and 2006 World Cups, eliminated after losing two opening matches before grabbing a late victory in the final match.\nThere was some criticism of the final minutes in the game, as both sides appeared to settle for the 1–0 scoreline.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nSenegal vs Colombia.\nThe two teams had met only once, a 2014 friendly game which ended in a 2–2 draw.\nThe referee awarded Senegal a penalty in the 17th minute. After consulting VAR, he judged that defender Davinson Sánchez had won the ball before making any contact with Sadio Mané. After half an hour, James Rodríguez was substituted with what appeared to be a recurrence of the injury that kept him out of Colombia's 2–1 loss to Japan. Mané took a free-kick in the 64th minute which he shot off-target. Kalidou Koulibaly got a touch on a Luis Muriel drive to deflect the ball narrowly wide. And in the 74th minute Colombia scored the decisive goal of the game, Juan Quintero's corner from the right found Yerry Mina who rose and crashed home a header that went through goalkeeper Khadim N'Diaye.\nWith Senegal being the last African team to be knocked out of Russia 2018, there were no teams from Africa in the round of 16 for the first time since the stage was introduced in 1986. Colombia were the only team to reach the knockout stage despite losing their opening match of the tournament. Senegal became the third team to be eliminated despite winning their opening game of the tournament (also Iran and Serbia); and even moreover, this was the first time Senegal got eliminated from the group stage, despite owning a huge advantage prior to the match against Colombia. The last time as many as three teams failed to get through the group stage despite winning their opener was in 2002 (Argentina, Costa Rica, and Russia).\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nDiscipline.\nFair play points were used as tiebreakers because the overall and head-to-head records of Japan and Senegal were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:\nOnly one of the above deductions were applied to a player in a single match."

        "title": "2018 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2018 Giro d'Italia was the 101st edition of the Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tour races. The race started in Jerusalem on 4 May, with a individual time trial followed by two additional stages within Israel. After a rest day, there were 18 further stages in Italy before the tour reached the finish in Rome on 27 May.\nThe race was won by Team Sky's Chris Froome, the first British rider to win the race. In winning, Froome completed a hat-trick of consecutive Grand Tour victories, becoming the first rider since Bernard Hinault to hold all three Grand Tour titles simultaneously. His victory was highlighted by an audacious 80 km solo breakaway to win the mountainous stage 19; attacking the small group of leaders including reigning champion Tom Dumoulin on the Cima Coppi of the 2018 Giro, the graveled climb of the Colle delle Finestre, he continued to extend his lead over the Sestriere and to the summit finish of Bardonecchia and overturned a more than three minute deficit to take both the pink jersey, the Cima Coppi prize and the mountains classification. The solo win, and the simultaneous implosion of long-time race leader Simon Yates, who lost more than 30 minutes on the day having lost contact on the first climb of the day, was described as \"one of the most extraordinary days in Giro d'Italia history\".\nHistory.\nThe Giro Big Start, touted as one of the most expensive sporting events in Israel's history, was largely financed by Canadian-Israeli mogul Sylvan Adams with the help of Israel's Tourism and Transportation Ministries. The 21-stage race began with a 10-kilometer time trial in Jerusalem, followed by a 167-kilometer race from Haifa to Tel Aviv, and a 229-kilometer race from Beersheba to Eilat. They were the first stages of any Grand Tour event ever that have been held outside Europe.\nThe 2018 Giro d'Italia Israel start was held to pay tribute to Italian cyclist Gino Bartali, a three-time winner of the Giro d'Italia. Bartali helped rescue hundreds of Italian Jews during the Holocaust and was recognized by Yad Vashem in 2013 as Righteous Among the Nations.\nThe race was won by 's Chris Froome, who therefore held all three Grand Tour titles simultaneously and became the first British cyclist to win the overall classification in the Giro. Froome crashed during a recon ride ahead of the prologue and lost time consistently over the first two weeks. In the final week, however, he won a stage that ended with the climb of Monte Zoncolan, then took back several minutes on all his rivals in Stage 19 with a ride described as \"one for the history books\". He ended up defeating the defending champion, Tom Dumoulin, by 46 seconds.\nTeams.\nAll 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and were obliged to attend the race. Four wildcard UCI Professional Continental teams were also selected. Each team started with eight riders (one less than in the previous year).\nLotto–Soudal chose to compete under a different name from the rest of the season: they became Lotto Fix ALL, using the name of a product made by Soudal, their normal sponsor.\nThe teams entering the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favorites.\nThe main pre-race favorites were reigning Tour de France and Vuelta a España champion Chris Froome (), defending champion Tom Dumoulin () and Fabio Aru (). Other general classification contenders were Miguel Ángel López (), Thibaut Pinot (), Wout Poels (), Simon Yates and Esteban Chaves (both ), George Bennett (), Louis Meintjes (), Michael Woods (), Davide Formolo (), Rohan Dennis () and Domenico Pozzovivo ().\nSprinters at the Giro included Elia Viviani, Jakub Mareczko, Niccolo Bonifazio, Danny van Poppel, Sacha Modolo, Sam Bennett, Jens Debusschere and Ryan Gibbons.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys are awarded. The first and most important is the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Riders receive time bonuses (10, 6 and 4 seconds respectively) for finishing in the first three places on each stage. Smaller time bonuses are also given to the top three riders at the last intermediate sprint on each stage (3, 2 and 1 seconds respectively). The rider with the lowest cumulative time is awarded the pink jersey (), and is considered the winner of the Giro d'Italia.\nAdditionally, there is a points classification. Riders win points for finishing in the top placings on each stage or by being within the first cyclists to reach intermediate sprint locations along each mass-start stage. Flat stages award more points than mountainous stages, meaning that this classification tends to favour sprinters. The leader of the points classification wore the cyclamen jersey.\nThere is also a mountains classification, for which points were awarded for reaching the top of a climb before other riders. Each climb was categorised as either first, second, third or fourth-category, with more points available for the more difficult, higher-categorised climbs. For first-category climbs, the top eight riders earned points; on second-category climbs, six riders won points; on third-category climbs, only the top four riders earned points with three on fourth-category climbs. The leadership of the mountains classification was marked by a blue jersey. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awards more points than the other first-category climbs, with nine riders scoring points. At , the \"Cima Coppi\" for the 2018 Giro d'Italia is the Colle delle Finestre.\nThe fourth jersey represents the young rider classification. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1994 are eligible. The winner of the classification is awarded a white jersey. There are also two classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added up; the leading team is one with the lowest total time. The Trofeo Super Team is a team points classification, with the top 20 riders of each stage earning points for their team.\nThe first additional award is the intermediate sprint classification. Each road stage has two sprints – the \"Traguardi Volanti\". The first 5 riders across the intermediate sprint lines are awarded points (10, 6, 3, 2 and 1 points respectively); the rider with the most points at the end of the race wins the classification. Another classification – the combativity prize () – involves points awarded to the first riders at the stage finishes, at intermediate sprints, and at the summits of categorised climbs. There is also a breakaway award (). For this, points are awarded to each rider in any breakaway smaller than 10 riders that escapes for at least . Each rider is awarded a point for each kilometre that the rider was away from the peloton. The rider with the most points at the end of the Giro wins the award. The final classification is a \"fair play\" ranking for each team. Teams are given penalty points for infringing various rules. These range from half-point penalties, for offences that merit warnings from race officials, to a 2000-point penalty, for a positive doping test. The team that has the lowest points total at the end of the Giro wins the classification."

The 1944 National Title Game was played on March 28, 1944, and it was played at the Madison Square Garden, New York, New York.\nBackground.\nUtah.\nThe Utah Redskins were coached by Vadal Peterson, and this was the Utes' first and only National Championship. The team had only 9 lettermen, 7 of which were freshmen, including eventual All-American Arnie Ferrin. They went 22-4 that season, but would not have qualified for the tournament had the Arkansas team not been involved in an automobile accident that killed an assistant coach and a player. The Redskins were invited to replace the Razorbacks a mere two days before the tournament was set to commence. They would beat Missouri and then go on to beat Iowa State to win the championship. The Redskins would not go to another National Championship game until 1998 in which they lost. Utah was the first team to be in the National Invitation Tournament and the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament both in the same season. Utah was an Independent that year.\nDartmouth.\nThe Dartmouth Indians were led by Earl Brown to their second and final National Championship appearance. Dartmouth beat Catholic University, and then faced off Ohio State until they got to the championship. The Indians went 19–2 that year. Dartmouth was and is still part of the Ivy League. The Indians were led by All-American Aud Brindley and experienced significant roster turnover due to World War II. The Indians lost lettermen Larry Killick, Joe Fater, Larry Baxter, John Monahan and Paul Campbell to the draft, but added standout players Dick McGuire of St. John's and Bob Gale of Cornell, who were transferred to Dartmouth as a part of their military training program.\nGame summary.\nWith 17,990 fans watching the game in New York, Utah hung tight with Dartmouth, who was favored by eight points prior to the game. For the first time in NCAA Championship Game history, an overtime period was required to determine a winner. Such overtime would not happen again until 1957. The next night, Utah played the winner of the National Invitational Tournament in St. John's as a charity event and won 43–36."

        "title": "2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup",
        "text": "The 2019 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the 10th FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, the premier international beach soccer championship contested by men's national teams of the member associations of FIFA. Overall, this was the 20th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995 to 2004 but was not governed by FIFA. This was the fifth tournament to take place under the biennial basis; the World Cup now takes place once every two years, having taken place annually until 2009.\nThe tournament was confirmed publicly on 3 November 2017, during the annual FIFA Beach Soccer Workshop in Dubai as part of the recently renewed partnership between FIFA and Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW). In October 2018, it was announced that the tournament would take place in Paraguay in the city of Luque, near the capital, Asunción, between 21 November and 1 December 2019. Fifteen teams advanced through preliminary continental qualification competitions, which started in September 2018 and ended in July 2019, to join the hosts in the final tournament which included Belarus as the sole team making their debut at the finals and notably saw the third placed team of the previous edition, Iran, fail to qualify. This was the first FIFA tournament to be hosted by Paraguay, the first edition of the World Cup held in South America since 2007, and the first time a landlocked country hosted beach soccer's principal event.\nFollowing two narrow loses, hosts Paraguay were eliminated at the group stage. Brazil were the defending champions, but were defeated at the quarter-finals stage by Russia in what was a repeat of the scenario of 2015, thereby condemning Brazil to their joint-worst ever result. Portugal won the tournament, besting Italy in the final to claim their second FIFA World Cup crown (following 2015) and third world title overall (including the 2001 World Championships); Italy collected a second runners-up medal, following 2008. For the first time, the podium teams were all European nations. Japan finished fourth, matching their best ever placing previously achieved in 2005. A joint-record tally of 286 goals were scored (with 2006).\nMadjer of Portugal made his last international beach soccer tournament appearance at this competition. The all-time top scorer of the competition, often heralded as the best player of all time, announced his retirement following the final, aged 42.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding schedule to determine the hosts was as follows:\nCountries known to have declared interest in bidding to host the competition are inclusive of but not exclusive to:\nOn 1 October 2018, the FIFA Organising Committee recommended hosting be awarded to Paraguay as they were the only association to make an official bid after the initial declaration of interest stage. Confirmation of the awarding of hosting rights to Paraguay was announced at the FIFA Council meeting in Kigali, Rwanda on 26 October 2018.\nQualification.\nA total of 16 teams qualified for the final tournament. In addition to Paraguay who qualified automatically as hosts, 15 other teams qualified from six separate continental competitions.\nThe slot allocation for each confederation was decided at the FIFA Council meeting on 26 October 2018.\nQualifying rounds.\nThe process of qualification to the World Cup finals began on 9 September 2018 and ended on 27 July 2019.\nQualified teams.\n\"Note: All appearance statistics below include only the FIFA era (since 2005); see: National team appearances in the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup for inclusion of the pre-FIFA era (1995–2004) stats\".\nVenue.\nOne venue was used in the city of Luque, part of the Greater Asunción area, on the grounds of the Paraguayan Olympic Committee headquarters.\nThe stadium was purpose-built for the tournament, having been constructed between January and August 2019. It was officially opened by FIFA president Gianni Infantino on 9 November 2019, under the nickname of the Paraguay national team, \"Los Pynandi\", meaning \"barefoot\" in Guarani. The Paraguayan Football Association (APF) and FIFA funded the US$1.5 million cost of the concrete structure. The main arena was complemented by three external, floodlit training pitches located adjacent.\nOrganisation.\nThe following were key milestones in the organisation of the tournament (not belonging of other sections):\nMatch officials.\nFIFA chose 24 officials from 24 different countries to referee matches at the World Cup, who were revealed on 29 October 2019. At least one referee was representing each of the six confederations: four from the AFC, three from CAF, five from CONMEBOL, three from CONCACAF, one from the OFC and eight from UEFA.\nThe most matches any one referee officiated in was seven (Domínguez, Ostrowski, Benchabane, González, Ángeles, Namazov, Mammadov); however it was Ivo Moraes who officiated the most matches as lead referee (three), including the final. Only Hugo Pado and Sergio Soares were not appointed as first referee of any match, the latter also officiating in the fewest total matches (one).\nDraw.\nThe draw to split the 16 teams into four groups of four took place on 13 September 2019 at 19:30 PYT (), at the CONMEBOL Convention Centre in Asunción, Paraguay. The draw was assisted by Roberto Acuna of Paraguay and Júnior of Brazil who both formerly represented their respective national teams at World Cups in both association football and beach soccer. CONMEBOL president, Alejandro Domínguez and Paraguayan Football Association (APF) president, Robert Harrison, also took part in the presentation.\nFor the purpose of the draw, the teams were divided into four pots each containing four teams. The teams were allocated into the respective pots based on their previous performances at recent World Cups, and their respective qualification tournaments. Initially, two teams from Pot 1 were automatically allocated to the groups – Paraguay, as the hosts, were assigned to position A1 and Brazil, as the defending champions, were assigned to position D1. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group, except for UEFA for which one group was permitted to contain two, since UEFA are represented by five teams.\nSquads.\nEach team had to name a preliminary squad of between 12 and 18 players. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 12 players (two of whom must be goalkeepers) by the FIFA deadline. Players in the final squad could be replaced by a player from the preliminary squad due to serious injury or illness up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match.\nThe squads included a number of high-profile players who, at this tournament, made their final international beach soccer appearances, announcing their retirements following the conclusion of the competition. This included Portuguese captain and three-time world champion Madjer (1998 debut, 583 caps), 2009 runners-up, Swiss captain Moritz \"Mo\" Jaeggy (2003 debut, 355 caps) and his brother, Valentin Jaeggy (2005 debut, 321 caps).\nGroup stage.\nEach team earned three points for a win in regulation time, two points for a win in extra time, one point for a win in a penalty shoot-out, and no points for a defeat. The top two teams of each group advanced to the quarter-finals.\nAll times are local, PYST ().\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of teams in the group stage was determined as follows:\nKnockout stage.\nSemi-finals.\nHeavy rain and strong winds threatened the postponement of the semi-finals and deterred fans from attending the matches.\nAwards.\nAfter the final, FIFA presented individual awards to the three best players of the tournament, three top goalscorers, and to the best goalkeeper. In addition, a collective award was given to the team with the most points in the Fair Play ranking. Following this, the winners' trophy was awarded to Portugal.\nIndividual awards.\nAlong with the eventual winners of the gold, silver and bronze ball awards, Takuya Akaguma (Japan), Rui Coimbra (Portugal), Gabriele Gori (Italy), Boris Nikonorov (Russia), Artur Paporotnyi (Russia), Fedor Zemskov (Russia) and Emmanuele Zurlo (Italy) were also announced as the candidates for the award in the initial ten-man shortlist.\nThe individual awards were all sponsored by Adidas, except for the FIFA Fair Play Award.\nThe goal of the tournament was decided via an online public vote from which there were ten options to choose from. The vote closed at 14:00 GMT on 9 December.\nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\nWith 16 goals, Italian forward Gabriele Gori finished as top scorer for the second consecutive tournament, a feat achieved only once previously during the FIFA era of World Cups, by Madjer in 2005 and 2006. Having failed to score at the last edition, Madjer scored one goal at this edition (what would be his last ever at a World Cup following his subsequent retirement) to extend his record tally of goals at FIFA World Cups to 88 (and 140 at all global championships).\nMedia.\nBroadcasting rights.\n180 territories broadcast matches of the tournament.\nThe following tables are a summary of some notable and participating territories' broadcasting licensee holders.\nIndividual territories listed that are also part of regional deals show the additional broadcasting licenses in those territories.\nClosing report.\nSocial media.\nAt the closing press conference on 30 November, head of FIFA Tournaments, Jaime Yarza reported that social media posts had generated over 46 million impressions, 1.7 million user interactions and 14 million video views, setting a new record for social media engagement of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, which Yarza claimed showed the continued growth of the sport.\nEconomic impact.\nPrior to the tournament, the Paraguayan Football Association (APF) estimated the competition would generate US$5 million for the local economy. The actual economic impact was reported at three times this amount of US$15 million at the closing press conference.\nAttendance figures.\nDespite struggling attendance figures, APF General Secretary Luis Kanonnikoff declared \"we are happy with the attendance numbers of both locals and foreigners.\""

        "text": "Al-Ittihad Ahli of Aleppo () is a major professional basketball club. It is a part of the Al-Ittihad Sports Club, which is based in Aleppo, Syria. Al-Ittihad is the second most titled basketball club with 17 Syrian League titles and 10 Syrian Cups one of the most successful basketball clubs in Syria. \"Al-Ahli\" was founded in 1951, two years after the founding of the multi-sport club and the football team.\nHistory.\nThe club, which was founded in 1951, is one of the most famous and popular basketball clubs in Syria. The club changed its name in 1972, its previous one, Al Ahli, being used as a club nickname.\nThe club's Great Era began in 1978 with the victory of the Syrian Cup and the defeat of Al Jalaa SC in the SBL final of the following 1979 season. In the league finals, Al-Ittihad defeated Al Jalaa in Aleppo twice 90-72 and 59-50, then achieved a third victory in the decisive match that took place in Damascus for exceptional circumstances 66-58. This season is also remarkable that they claimed the Republic Cup by defeating Al Jalaa 76-71.\nAl Ittihad has twice been invited to take part in the FIBA European Champions Cup (EuroLeague). The first participation was in the 1979-80 season, during which the club, led by coach Munther Shalaby, faced in Group E the KK Partizan, BC Partizani Tirana and Budapest Honvéd SE. The club was supposed to take part in the 1981–82 FIBA European Champions Cup as well, but after its beginning they withdrew from the competition.\nDuring the 1980s, Al-Ittihad was the Syrian League's hegemon as they won every domestic competition. The club's first major success on the international stage was third place at the 1991 Arab Basketball Championships. In the following season, the club won both home titles, advanced to the finals of the Arab Championship and defeated EO La Goulette Kram. The Great Era of domestic domination ended in the 1994 season with a loss in the SBL final with the Al-Wahda.\nIn the 2000 season, they won their last long title in the Syrian Cup, the penultimate title in the SBL and advanced to the WABA Champions Cup. In the 2001 season, however, they finished third behind Al-Wahda and Orthodox BC.\nIn the 2006 season, they won their last domestic SBL title, finishing ahead of Al Jalaa SC, Al-Jaish and Al Wahda in the Final Four. In the 2007 and 2008 seasons, they participated in the WABA Cup, but without significant success.\nAfter the outbreak of the conflict in Syria and the Battle of Aleppo, the club's operations were limited and its survival uncertain. Fortunately, the sports club managed to survive and the first big success under coach Bassel al Hamwi was the Syrian Cup victory in the 2020 season.\nIn the 2022 season, Al-Ittihad won the Syrian Super Cup when they defeated Al-Wahda 60:52 in the final of the competition.\nIn 2022, the Syrian General Sports Federation approved the club's name change to Al-Ittihad Ahli of Aleppo SC, inspired by the club's original name Halab Al-Ahli Club; following pleads by the fans to restore the club's original name.\nHome arena.\nFor many years, Ittihad has used the Al-Assad Sports Arena, with a seating capacity of 3,500, to host its home games. Currently, Ittihad uses the 7,964 seat Al-Hamadaniah Sports Arena for its home games.\nClub rivalries.\nAl-Ittihad Ahli of Aleppo SC plays the Aleppo city derby \"El Clásico\" with its main rival Al-Jalaa SC. also the most watched match in Syria is the \"Syrian El Clàsico\" between Al-Ittihad Ahli of Aleppo SC and their biggest rival Al-Wahda SC Damascus\nOther urban rivals of the club are Al-Hurriya SC, Al-Yarmouk SC (Homenetmen) and Ouroube SC.\nCurrent roster.\nSquad for the 2021–2022 Syrian Basketball League season:\nTransfers.\n\"Transfers for the 2021-22 season:\"\n Joining\n Leaving"

        "title": "2020 UEFA Champions League final",
        "text": "The 2020 UEFA Champions League final was the final match of the 2019–20 UEFA Champions League, the 65th season of Europe's premier club football tournament organised by UEFA, and the 28th season since it was re-branded from the European Champion Clubs' Cup to the UEFA Champions League. It was played on 23 August 2020 at the Estádio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal, between French club Paris Saint-Germain, in their first European Cup final, and German club Bayern Munich. The match was held behind closed doors due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.\nOriginally, it had been scheduled to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 30 May 2020. On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the final to Lisbon as part of a \"final-eight tournament\" consisting of single-match knockout ties played in two stadiums across the city. The match was the first European premier tournament final to be played on a Sunday, and the first since 2009 to not be played on a Saturday. It was also the first final of the competition to be played after June.\nBayern Munich won the final 1–0 thanks to a 59th-minute goal scored by former Paris Saint-Germain player Kingsley Coman, who was later selected as man of the match. Bayern secured their sixth European Cup title and second continental treble, becoming the second European men's football team to win the continental treble twice. Bayern also became the first team to claim any European competition with a 100% winning record. As winners, they earned the right to play against the winners of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, Sevilla, in the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar; Bayern went on to win both and complete a historic sextuple (six trophies in a year).\nTeams.\n\"In the following table, finals until 1992 were in the European Cup era, since 1993 were in the UEFA Champions League era.\"\nVenue.\nThe final was originally scheduled to be played at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul, Turkey, on 30 May 2020. However, UEFA announced on 23 March 2020 that the final was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee chose to relocate the final to Lisbon as part of a \"final-eight tournament\" consisting of single-match knockout ties played in two stadiums across the city. The match was the first European Cup/Champions League final to be played on a Sunday and the first since 2009 to not be played on a Saturday. It was also the first final of the competition to be played after June.\nThe UEFA Executive Committee chose the Estádio da Luz, officially known as the Estádio do Sport Lisboa e Benfica, in Lisbon as the final venue at their meeting on 17 June 2020. This is the second UEFA Champions League final hosted at the stadium; the first was in 2014, when Real Madrid secured their 10th title by beating Atlético Madrid 4–1 in the first final between teams from the same city.\nThe home stadium of Portuguese Primeira Liga side Benfica since 2003, it was newly built to host five matches of UEFA Euro 2004, including the final. Before its demolition in 2003, to make way for the new 65,000-capacity ground, the original Estádio da Luz hosted the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final, where Werder Bremen beat Monaco 2–0, and the second leg of the 1983 UEFA Cup Final, where Anderlecht secured a 1–1 draw with Benfica to lift the trophy.\nLisbon had also staged a European Cup final in 1967, when Scottish side Celtic beat Inter Milan of Italy 2–1 at the Estádio Nacional. The Portuguese capital also hosted the 2005 UEFA Cup Final at the Estádio José Alvalade, home of Benfica's local rivals and finalists Sporting CP, who lost 3–1 to CSKA Moscow.\nBackground.\nParis Saint-Germain (PSG) reached their first European Cup/Champions League final, becoming the fifth finalist representing France and the 41st overall. They entered the final having played 110 prior matches in the European Cup and Champions League, the most for a final debutant, surpassing Arsenal's record of 90 matches prior to their final debut in 2006. The match was the seventh final to feature a French team, and the first since Monaco in 2004. Marseille were the only French club to have won the competition, doing so in 1993. The match was the third time Paris Saint-Germain have appeared in the final of a UEFA competition, having previously appeared in two consecutive finals of the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. The club won the 1996 final 1–0 against Rapid Wien, before losing 1–0 against Barcelona while attempting to defend their title in 1997. PSG also featured in the 1996 UEFA Super Cup, losing 9–2 on aggregate to Juventus. Paris were attempting to become the first French team to complete a continental treble, having won Ligue 1, which was awarded to them based on PPG ratio as the season was ended prematurely due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France, and the Coupe de France. The club also won the final season of the Coupe de la Ligue (league cup) and the Trophée des Champions (super cup), thus winning all four domestic titles, though only the main domestic cup competition was considered for a continental treble.\nIn eighteen matches, Paris Saint-Germain had a record of eleven wins, two draws and five losses against German clubs in European competition. PSG won all four prior knockout ties in which they met German opposition, including earlier in the season against Borussia Dortmund in the round of 16 and RB Leipzig in the semi-finals.\nBayern Munich reached their eleventh European Cup/Champions League final, tying Milan for the second-most finals behind Real Madrid's 16. Most recently they appeared in the 2013 final, in which they won 2–1 against fellow German club Borussia Dortmund for their fifth title. In their prior finals, Bayern Munich won on four other occasions in 1974, 1975, 1976 and 2001, and lost in 1982, 1987, 1999, 2010 and 2012. The match was Bayern's 13th overall final in European competition, having won the 1967 European Cup Winners' Cup Final 1–0 after extra time against Rangers and the 1996 UEFA Cup Final 5–1 on aggregate against Bordeaux. Bayern Munich were chasing a second treble in club history (previously doing so in 2012–13), having won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal. Entering the final, Bayern are on a 20-match winning streak and undefeated in 2020, having not lost in their prior 29 matches (winning 28 and drawing once). With their semi-final win, Bayern also tied the record for the most consecutive wins in the competition proper, as well as the most wins from the start of the competition proper, with 10. Bayern are the second team to have entered the final with a perfect winning record, after Milan in 1993, who lost to the only French winners in competition history, Marseille. Bayern are also the second club to reach the final after winning all six group stage matches, after the aforementioned Milan team in 1992–93.\nBayern Munich scored 42 goals in 10 matches during the competition prior to the final, second only to Barcelona's record of 45 goals in 16 matches during the 1999–2000 season. However, Bayern set a new record for the best goals per game ratio in competition history following their quarter-final (regardless of the outcome of the remainder of the competition), with 4.2 per match after their semi-final victory. Entering the final, forward Robert Lewandowski scored 15 goals in 9 matches during the Champions League season, with only Cristiano Ronaldo having scored more in a single campaign (17 in 2013–14 and 16 in 2015–16). Lewandowski also tied Ruud van Nistelrooy's mark from 2002–03 of scoring in nine consecutive Champions League matches, second only to Ronaldo's 11 from 2017–18. Lewandowski and Serge Gnabry set a record for the most prolific scoring partnership in a season with 24 combined goals, surpassing the record of 23 between Ronaldo and Gareth Bale in 2013–14. Bayern manager Hansi Flick became the 15th individual to appear in a Champions League final as both a player and manager, having played for Bayern in their loss to Porto in the 1987 final.\nIn 34 matches, Bayern Munich had a record of 19 wins, 5 draws and ten losses against French clubs in European competition. Bayern won six of their seven previous knockout ties against French opposition, two of which were finals, including their semi-final win over Lyon to reach the 2020 final. Bayern's only loss was 3–2 on aggregate against Saint-Étienne in the first round of the 1969–70 European Cup.\nThe final was the ninth meeting between Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, with a record of five wins for PSG and three wins for Bayern. The fixture was the first knockout match between the sides, with all their prior meetings occurring in the Champions League group stages. The sides most recently met in the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League group stage; Paris won the first match 3–0 at home, while Bayern won the return match 3–1. As the sides were level on points, PSG won the group on head-to-head goal difference.\nThe match was the second European Cup final to feature a French and German team, after the 1976 final between Bayern and Saint-Étienne. Overall, it was the fourth final in European competition between teams from France and Germany, also occurring in the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup Final (between Werder Bremen and Monaco) and the 1996 UEFA Cup Final (between Bayern and Bordeaux). On all three occasions, German teams were victorious. It was also the third final in which both teams entered the match seeking a win to secure the treble, previously occurring in 2010, in which Bayern lost to Inter Milan, and 2015, when Barcelona defeated Juventus. The 1999 final, won by Manchester United, also had both finalists seeking a treble, though Bayern had not yet contested their domestic cup final (which they ultimately lost). Both sides came into the final having won their domestic leagues the previous season, the first time this had happened since the 1998 final between Juventus and Real Madrid. It was also the first time since 1994 that both finalists won their domestic league in the previous and same season as reaching the final. The final was also the second to feature two German managers, after the 2013 final with managers Jürgen Klopp of Borussia Dortmund and Jupp Heynckes of Bayern Munich.\nRoad to the final.\n\"Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away; N: neutral).\"\nParis Saint-Germain.\nParis Saint-Germain qualified for the Champions League group stage by winning the 2018–19 Ligue 1 season, their sixth title in seven seasons and eighth overall French title. In the group stage, they were drawn into Group A alongside Real Madrid of Spain, record winners of the European Cup, as well as Galatasaray of Turkey and Club Brugge of Belgium.\nIn the opening match of the group stage, Paris faced Real Madrid at the Parc des Princes and won 3–0 via a first-half brace from former Madrid player Ángel Di María and a second-half stoppage time goal from Thomas Meunier. On matchday 2, PSG won 1–0 against Galatasaray at the Türk Telekom Stadium with a 52nd-minute goal from Mauro Icardi. Paris Saint-Germain continued their perfect start to the competition by defeating Club Brugge 5–0 at the Jan Breydel Stadium, with a brace from Icardi and hat-trick from Kylian Mbappé. In their home meeting against Brugge, Icardi scored PSG's lone goal in a 1–0 win to advance to the knockout stage. On matchday 5, Paris recovered from a two-goal deficit to draw 2–2 at the Santiago Bernabéu against Madrid and win Group A, with Mbappé and Pablo Sarabia's late goals offsetting a Karim Benzema brace. In their final match, Paris Saint-Germain won 5–0 at home against Galatasaray to finish the group stage undefeated and having only conceded two goals.\nIn the round of 16, PSG were drawn against German club Borussia Dortmund. In the first leg at the Westfalenstadion, Paris lost 2–1 with Neymar scoring a goal in between a brace from Erling Haaland. The second leg was one of the last European matches played prior to the suspension of the competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and took place behind closed doors on 11 March 2020. PSG won the match 2–0 with first-half goals from Neymar and Juan Bernat, securing a 3–2 aggregate win for the Parisians and their first quarter-final appearance since the 2015–16 season.\nParis were drawn against Italian club Atalanta in the quarter-finals, who were participating in their debut season of the Champions League. The one-off tie was played on 12 August 2020 at the neutral Estádio da Luz. Atalanta took the lead in the first-half with a goal from Mario Pašalić. PSG struggled to find an equaliser in the second half, until Marquinhos scored from close range in the 90th minute before substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting scored three minutes later to snatch a late win for Paris. Paris Saint-Germain advanced to the Champions League semi-finals for the second time in their history after the 1994–95 season.\nIn the semi-finals, Paris Saint-Germain faced RB Leipzig of Germany, who had qualified to the Champions League knockout stage for the first time in only their second season competing in the competition. Marquinhos and Di María scored in the first half at Estádio da Luz, while Bernat scored 11 minutes into the second period to earn PSG a 3–0 win and a spot in their first Champions League final.\nBayern Munich.\nBayern Munich qualified directly for the group stage of the Champions League by winning the 2018–19 Bundesliga, their 7th consecutive and 29th overall German title. In the group stage, they were drawn into Group B alongside Tottenham Hotspur of England, runners-up of the previous Champions League season, as well as Olympiacos of Greece and Red Star Belgrade of Serbia. The team began their season under Croatian manager Niko Kovač.\nIn their first match, Bayern faced Red Star Belgrade in a home match at the Allianz Arena and won 3–0 with goals from Kingsley Coman, Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller. In their second fixture against Tottenham at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Bayern won 7–2 with a goal from Joshua Kimmich, a brace from Lewandowski and four goals scored by Serge Gnabry. The result was the heaviest home loss by an English club in European competition. On matchday 3, Bayern faced Olympiacos at the Karaiskakis Stadium and recovered from a deficit to win 3–2 and maintain their lead in the group with a brace from Lewandowski followed by a curled goal from Corentin Tolisso, while Youssef El-Arabi and Guilherme scored for the Greek side.\nHowever, as Bayern lost 5–1 to Eintracht Frankfurt in the Bundesliga on 2 November, manager Niko Kovač was sacked the following day and replaced by former assistant Hansi Flick on an interim basis. In Flick's first match in charge three days later, Bayern won the rematch against Olympiacos 2–0 via second-half goals from Lewandowski and Ivan Perišić, thus securing a spot in the knockout stage. On 26 November, Bayern Munich won 6–0 against Red Star Belgrade at the Red Star Stadium to win Group B, with Lewandowski scoring four times between goals from Leon Goretzka and Tolisso. In their final match, goals from Coman, Müller and Philippe Coutinho earned Bayern a 3–1 home win against Tottenham Hotspur to finish with a perfect group stage record, while Ryan Sessegnon scored the only goal for the visitors. This was the seventh occasion a team finished the group stage with six wins from six, with Bayern the sixth club to do so. Following a successful spell as interim manager, Bayern announced on 22 December that Flick would remain manager until the end of season.\nBayern were drawn against English club Chelsea in the round of 16, with the last Champions League meeting between the sides taking place in the 2012 final. In the first leg away at Stamford Bridge, Bayern won 3–0 via a brace from Gnabry followed by a tap-in from Lewandowski set-up by Alphonso Davies. Chelsea defender Marcos Alonso was sent off late in the match, which was the club's heaviest home loss in European competition. Following the match, Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge suggested Flick would stay permanently as manager. On 3 April, Flick signed a new contract with the club lasting until 2023. Due to the suspension of the competition due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the second leg was delayed from 18 March until 8 August 2020, and was played behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena. Bayern won the second meeting 4–1, with a Lewandowski brace and goals from Perišić and Tolisso earning a 7–1 victory on aggregate, while Tammy Abraham scored for the visitors. The result was Chelsea's heaviest defeat in a two-legged European tie.\nAs a result of the draw, Bayern faced Spanish club Barcelona in the quarter-finals. The match, played at the Estádio da Luz, finished as an 8–2 win for Bayern Munich, with Perišić, Gnabry, Kimmich and Lewandowski scoring once each while Müller and Coutinho both earned braces. David Alaba scored an early own goal for Barcelona, who netted their only other goal via a Luis Suárez strike in the 57th minute. For Bayern Munich, the result was the most goals scored by the club in a match during the Champions League era, and the second most for them in competition history after nine scored against Omonia in the 1972–73 European Cup. The match was the first time Barcelona conceded six goals or more in European competition, and the first time they conceded four goals in the first half of a Champions League match. It was Barcelona's heaviest defeat since 1951, when they lost 6–0 to Espanyol in the 1950–51 La Liga, and the first time they conceded eight goals in a game since 1946, when they lost 8–0 to Sevilla in the 1946 Copa del Generalísimo.\nBayern met French club Lyon in the semi-finals of the competition at the Estádio José Alvalade, a rematch of the 2009–10 semi-finals. Bayern won 3–0 with a brace from Gnabry followed by a late goal from Lewandowski to advance to their first Champions League final since 2013.\nPre-match.\nIdentity.\nThe original identity of the 2020 UEFA Champions League final was unveiled at the group-stage draw on 29 August 2019.\nAmbassador.\nThe ambassador for the original Istanbul final was former Turkish international Hamit Altıntop, who finished as runner-up in the 2009–10 UEFA Champions League with Bayern Munich as well as winning the 2003 and 2004 UEFA Intertoto Cups with Schalke 04.\nOfficials.\nOn 20 August 2020, UEFA named Italian Daniele Orsato as the referee for the final. Orsato had been a FIFA referee since 2010, and was previously the fourth official in the 2019 UEFA Europa League Final. He was also an assistant video assistant referee in the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final. He was also an additional assistant referee at UEFA Euro 2016 and a video assistant referee at the 2018 FIFA World Cup. He was joined by four of his fellow countrymen, with Lorenzo Manganelli and Alessandro Giallatini as assistant referees, Massimiliano Irrati as the video assistant referee and Marco Guida as the assistant VAR official. The fourth official was Ovidiu Hațegan of Romania, while Spaniards Roberto Díaz Pérez del Palomar and Alejandro Hernández Hernández served as the offside and support VAR officials, respectively.\nTeam selection.\nEach team made one change to their starting line-up following the semi-finals. After recovering from injury, Paris Saint-Germain first-choice goalkeeper Keylor Navas started in place of Sergio Rico. For Bayern Munich, manager Hansi Flick decided to replace Ivan Perišić, who had started in the three prior Champions League matches, with Paris native Kingsley Coman on the left wing. Centre-back Jérôme Boateng was also deemed fit to start for Bayern, having suffered a minor injury in the semi-final which required him to be substituted off at half-time.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nParis Saint-Germain kicked off the match, though Bayern Munich began quickly in the opening stages, before Paris found their way into the game after 10 minutes. In the 18th minute, PSG had their first clear opportunity when Kylian Mbappé passed to Neymar on the left side of the penalty area, but his shot was blocked by the leg of Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. In the 22nd minute, Bayern forward Robert Lewandowski received the ball in the penalty area, swiveling and shooting the ball towards the goal which deflected off the inside of the left post and back into play. Two minutes later, Ángel Di María found himself with space in front of goal after a one-two with Ander Herrera, but shot the ball over the crossbar of Neuer's goal. During the sequence, Bayern defender Jérôme Boateng injured himself, and had to be replaced by Niklas Süle. Herrera had a drop-kick deflected wide of the Bayern goal in the 29th minute, while Lewandowski's 31st-minute dipping header was parried by PSG goalkeeper Keylor Navas. In the 45th minute, a misplaced pass by David Alaba in the Bayern back line fell in front of Mbappé, who played a one-two with Herrera before shooting the ball straight at Neuer when confronted by a clear opening on goal. In the following minute of first-half stoppage time, Kingsley Coman was hit on the shoulder by the arm of defender Thilo Kehrer and went down in the penalty area after cutting down the goal line. However, referee Daniele Orsato dismissed the Bayern appeals for a penalty, and blew for half-time with the match scoreless.\nIn the second half, Bayern scored the only goal in the 59th minute with a header by Coman, a PSG academy graduate. Thomas Müller laid a pass from Serge Gnabry back to right-back Joshua Kimmich, who crossed the ball from the right into the box towards the unmarked Coman at the far post, which was headed across the goal past Navas and into the right corner of the net. Following the goal, Bayern quickly created additional opportunities in the Parisian half, but were unable to capitalise on the chances. Bayern subsequently switched to a more defensive approach, and in the 70th minute Neuer made another save with his leg after Marquinhos found himself clear on goal following a pass from Ángel Di María into the left side of the penalty box. Three minutes later, Mbappé was caught on the back of his foot by Kimmich after cutting inside the Bayern penalty area, but referee Orsato again decided to not award a penalty. The final chance of the match came in stoppage time, when Mbappé ran down the inside-left channel and passed to Neymar on the left side of Bayern's penalty box, who turned sharply and shot wide of the far post, with substitute Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting's outstretched leg failing to meet the ball directly in front of the goal. Minutes later, the match ended as a 1–0 win for Bayern, securing the continental treble.\nDetails.\nThe \"home\" team (for administrative purposes) was determined by an additional draw held on 10 July 2020 (after the quarter-final and semi-final draws), at the UEFA headquarters in Nyon, Switzerland.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nPost-match.\nWith the win, Bayern Munich secured their sixth European Cup title to draw level with Liverpool, behind only Real Madrid (14 titles) and Milan (7 titles). As Bayern also won the Bundesliga and DFB-Pokal, they secured a second continental treble after the 2012–13 season. It was the ninth treble won in Europe, with Bayern Munich only the second club to win it twice after Barcelona in 2008–09 and 2014–15.\nFormer Paris Saint-Germain player Kingsley Coman, who scored the winning goal for Bayern, earned the man of the match award. Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was voted as the Champions League player of the week, having made three saves during the match to keep a clean sheet. Bayern became the first club to win any European competition with a perfect winning record, emerging victorious in all 11 matches. As a result, it was also the 14th occasion a club won the Champions League unbeaten, with Bayern the 10th club to do so, and the first since Manchester United in 2007–08.\nWith the win, six Bayern players secured their second European Cup title, five of which were from the club's victorious 2012–13 Champions League campaign: David Alaba, Jérôme Boateng, Javi Martínez, Thomas Müller and Manuel Neuer. Therefore, these five joined eight other players who have won two European trebles: Dani Alves, Sergio Busquets, Andrés Iniesta, Lionel Messi, Pedro, Gerard Piqué and Xavi with Barcelona in 2008–09 and 2014–15, as well as Samuel Eto'o with Barcelona in 2008–09 and Inter Milan in 2009–10. Thiago was the only other Bayern player to have won the Champions League prior, doing so with Barcelona in 2010–11. Alphonso Davies became the first Canadian male international to win the Champions League.\nParis Saint-Germain's defeat meant that the past seven final debutants since the success of Borussia Dortmund in 1997 had all lost, including fellow Ligue 1 club Monaco in 2004. This also meant their arch-rival Marseille were still the only French club to ever win the European Cup, having done so in 1993. The match was the lowest-scoring Champions League final since the goalless 2003 edition between Juventus and Milan and the first final to be ended 1–0 since Real Madrid's victory over Juventus in 1998.\nFollowing the completion of the competition, UEFA's Technical Observers named nine Bayern Munich players in the Champions League squad of the season: David Alaba, Alphonso Davies, Serge Gnabry, Leon Goretzka, Joshua Kimmich, Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Müller, Manuel Neuer and Thiago. For Paris Saint-Germain, Marquinhos, Kylian Mbappé and Neymar were included in the squad.\nAs the winners, Bayern also qualified to enter the group stage of the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League; however as Bayern already qualified through their league performance, the berth reserved was given to the team that was top of the abandoned 2019–20 Eredivisie (Ajax), the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list.\nFollowing the loss, Paris Saint-Germain fans clashed with riot police in Paris, including on the Champs-Élysées and near the Parc des Princes. Cars were ignited, buildings were attacked, and flares and fireworks were shot at police after tear gas was used to disperse fans.\nThe two teams met again the following season at the quarter-final stage. The scores were level at 3–3 after the two legs, but Paris Saint-Germain won on away goals.\nViewership.\nIn France, the final was televised on TF1, and drew an average of 11.1 million viewers, making it the third most watched Champions League final ever in France, after the 1993 and 2004 finals which also involved teams from the country. The game was also shown live on RMC Sport, who did not disclose their viewing figures. In Germany, the match drew a viewership of 12.8 million, which was around 39.9% of the market share, on state-owned ZDF, and another 1.04 million viewers watching the match through pay-television broadcaster Sky Deutschland."

The event began on Thursday 1 February at the 3Arena in Dublin and ended with the play-offs at The O2 Arena in London on Thursday 17 May. This was the first year that the tournament is sponsored by Unibet.\nMichael van Gerwen won his fourth Premier League title (and his third in a row, after winning in 2016 and 2017) by defeating Michael Smith 11–4 in the final.\nThis was also the first time that the event has had a round in Germany, when the Mercedes-Benz Arena in Berlin hosted the 4th round on 22 February.\nStorm Emma resulted in the Exeter round of the event being postponed on 1 March. This was the first time ever since the Premier League started in 2005 that a whole round in the league phase of Premier League Darts was postponed. The same extreme conditions would also go on to cause severe problems in the staging of that weekends UK Open in Minehead which resulted in the event having to be played entirely behind closed doors. In 2010, the play-offs were postponed for 24 hours after a power cut at Wembley Arena.\nFormat.\nThe tournament format was identical to that since 2013. During the first nine weeks (Phase 1) each player played the other nine players once. The bottom two players were then eliminated from the competition. In the next six weeks (phase 2) each player played the other seven players once. Phase 2 consisted of four weeks where five matches were played followed by two weeks where four matches were played. At the end of phase 2, the top four players contested the two semi-finals and the final in the play-off week.\nPlayers.\nThe players in this year's tournament were announced following the 2018 PDC World Darts Championship final on 1 January, with the top four of the PDC Order of Merit joined by six Wildcards. This was the first time in the event's history in which Phil Taylor did not take part, following his decision to retire. Unlike in previous years the six wildcards were joint decisions by the PDC and Sky Sports this year. There were no PDC specific wildcards or Sky Sports specific wildcards.\nThe tournament was noteworthy for its high-number of debuting players. Rob Cross qualified by right due to being in the world's top four at the end of the season, with wildcards going to World Grand Prix champion Daryl Gurney, Champions League winner Mensur Suljović, and world number 12 Gerwyn Price. In fact, only four of the previous year's ten players (van Gerwen, Wright, Anderson and van Barneveld) were included this year.\nPrize money.\nThe prize fund remained the same as last year, £825,000.\nLeague stage.\n1 February – week 1 (Phase 1).\n 3Arena, Dublin\n8 February – week 2 (Phase 1).\n Motorpoint Arena, Cardiff\n15 February – week 3 (Phase 1).\n Metro Radio Arena, Newcastle\n22 February – Week 4 (Phase 1).\n Mercedes-Benz Arena, Berlin\n1 March – Initial Week 5 Cancelled.\n Westpoint Arena, Exeter\nThe scheduled 5th week was cancelled due to Storm Emma. The matches, which were scheduled to be played that day, were instead played in Week 9 in Liverpool, with that week's games now being Judgement Night. In order to complete the schedule within the timescale, two rounds of Phase 2 were played on Wednesday 18 April and Thursday 19 April (Week 11) in the Rotterdam Ahoy complex.\n8 March – Week 5 (Phase 1).\n First Direct Arena, Leeds\n15 March – Week 6 (Phase 1).\n Motorpoint Arena, Nottingham\n22 March – Week 7 (Phase 1).\n SSE Hydro, Glasgow\n29 March – Week 8 (Phase 1).\n SSE Arena, Belfast\n5 April – Week 9 (Phase 1 – Judgement Night).\n Echo Arena, Liverpool\nThe night was overshadowed by the sudden death of 5 time World Champion Eric Bristow, who suffered a heart attack outside the venue. His death was announced during the Gurney v Wright match. The crowd paid tribute to Bristow at the end of the night's play.\n12 April – week 10 (Phase 2).\n FlyDSA Arena, Sheffield\n18 April – week 11A (Double Header, Phase 2).\n Rotterdam Ahoy, Rotterdam\n19 April – week 11B (Double Header, Phase 2).\n Rotterdam Ahoy, Rotterdam\n26 April – week 12 (Phase 2).\n Manchester Arena, Manchester\n3 May – week 13 (Phase 2).\n Arena Birmingham, Birmingham\n10 May – week 14 (Phase 2).\n BHGE Arena, Aberdeen\nPlay-offs – 17 May.\n The O2 Arena, London\nTable and streaks.\nTable.\nAfter the first nine weeks (phase 1), the bottom two in the table are eliminated. In the next six weeks (phase 2) the eight remaining players each play a further seven matches. The top four players then compete in the playoffs.\nTwo points are awarded for a win and one point for a draw. When players are tied on points, leg difference is used first as a tie-breaker, after that legs won against throw and then tournament average."

        "text": "Equestrian at the 2018 Summer Youth Olympics was held from 8 to 13 October 2018 at the Argentine Equestrian Club in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter a maximum of 1 athlete. Athletes qualified into one of six zones (Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australasia and Africa) containing five athletes. As hosts, Argentina was automatically given a rider and up to 6 spots were available to the Tripartite Commission, though not all were used; this caused a reduction from the zone quota depending which zone the chosen athlete is from.

The events took place at the Parque Tres de Febrero in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\nFormat.\nFor the Youth Olympics instead of competitors competing separately they compete as a team. In the boys' and girls' combined team event two athletes compete together. The event contains five stages; three road events (road race, criterium and time trial) and two cross-country events (cross-country eliminator and short track). One member of each team competes in each stage with the exception of the road race where both cyclists compete.\nTwo mixed BMX events (racing and freestyle park) will take place with each team containing one boy and one girl. The freestyle park event will contain a team of athletes from different nations.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter a maximum of 1 team of 2 athletes for the combined events and the BMX racing event. For the BMX freestyle park event each NOC can enter a maximum of 1 boy and 1 girl. As hosts, Argentina was given a team to compete in the combined events and the BMX racing event, however, they declined to use the BMX quota. A further six teams, two in each of the combined events and the BMX racing event was to be decided by the Tripartite Commission, however only two quotas was given to the boys' combined event and one quota was given the girls' combined event, the rest were reallocated to the nation rankings. The remaining quotas for the combined events are to be decided by the YOG Junior Nations Rankings, calculated by using the best ranking from the 2017 Junior Road Nations’ Cup Ranking or the 2017 Junior Cross-Country Mountain Bike World Championships.\nThe remaining quotas for the Mixed BMX Racing event will be decided by the YOG BMX Junior Nations Rankings, calculated by using the best ranking from the UCI Men’s or Women’s Junior BMX Nations Rankings. The quotas for the Mixed BMX Freestyle Park event will be decided by the ranking of individuals after the 2017 Urban Cycling World Championships.\nTo be eligible to participate at the Youth Olympics athletes must have been born between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2001."

        "text": "The 2017–18 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team represented Georgetown University in the 2017–18 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Hoyas, led by first-year head coach Patrick Ewing, played their home games at the Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C. as members of the Big East Conference. They finished the season 15–15, 5–13 in Big East play to finish in eighth place. They lost in the first round of the Big East tournament to St. John's.\nPrevious season.\nThe Hoyas finished the 2016–17 season at 14–18, 5–13 in Big East play, to finish in ninth place in the conference. As the No. 9 seed in the Big East tournament, they lost in the first round to St. John's. Georgetown finished the season with a losing record for the second straight year, the first time that had happened since the 1971–72 and 1972–73 seasons, and without an invitation to a postseason tournament in consecutive years for the first time since 1973 and 1974.\nOn March 23, 2017, Georgetown officials announced that head coach John Thompson III had been fired. On April 2, it was reported that Basketball Hall of Famer and Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing would replace Thompson as head coach.\nArrival of Patrick Ewing.\nOn April 3, 2017, Georgetown hired Patrick Ewing to replace the fired John Thompson III as head coach. Generally considered the greatest player in Georgetown men's basketball history, Ewing had led the Georgetown teams of 1981 through 1985, which had reached the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament′s championship game three times and won one national championship, in 1984. He then went on to a Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame 17-season playing career in the National Basketball Association, playing for the New York Knicks from 1985 to 2000, the Seattle SuperSonics from 2000 to 2001, and the Orlando Magic from 2001 to 2002. After that, he spent 15 years as an NBA assistant coach, with the Washington Wizards from 2002 to 2003, the Houston Rockets from 2003 to 2006, the Orlando Magic from 2007 to 2012, and the Charlotte Bobcats/Charlotte Hornets from 2012 to 2017. Although he had made it clear that he desired a head coaching job in the NBA and had interviewed for head coaching positions, he had never been a head coach at any level before taking the job at Georgetown. After taking over at Georgetown, he told the press that he never would have considered taking a college coaching job anywhere except at Georgetown where, he said, \"I was able to...spend four of the best years of my life.\"\nAfter graduating from Georgetown in 1985, Ewing had left the world of college basketball behind completely during his 32 years of playing and coaching in the NBA. The role of a college coach differed significantly from that of an NBA coach: Player acquisition was very different, requiring compliance with a myriad of National Collegiate Athletic Association recruiting and eligibility rules and a nearly constant recruiting effort. Since his college days, much had changed in college basketball, including the rise of the influence of the Amateur Athletic Union and the orientation of recruiting and coaching toward developing players for NBA careers, as well as the impatience of many college players, who tended to view their college careers as a necessary step on their way to an NBA career but no longer viewed college as a four-year – or even any more than a one-year – commitment. College coaching also required a significant amount of off-court player management, such as ensuring players went to class and met Georgetown's academic eligibility requirements. Critics of Georgetown's decision to hire Ewing argued that his lack of experience in these matters would undermine his ability to lead the Georgetown program. Ewing countered that he had a great deal of experience with young NBA players who had foregone some or all of their college eligibility to play in the NBA and that he had hired a staff including assistant coaches Louis Orr and Robert Kirby – that could provide him with well-informed advice and guide him through the modern world of college basketball. However, his arrival required the departure of his son, Patrick Ewing Jr., a former Georgetown player who had served under John Thompson III as an assistant coach since August 2015; under Georgetown University's nepotism policies, the younger Ewing was not allowed to serve in a position in which he reported directly to his father. Many commentators mocked the idea of a nepotism clause at Georgetown given John Thompson III's 13-year tenure as head coach while his father, former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr., remained a major figure in the men's basketball program, but the clause did not apply in that case because the younger Thompson was not on his father's staff, reporting to athletic director Lee Reed and not to his father.\nEwing said he would abandon John Thompson III's deliberate \"Princeton offense\" and move Georgetown's game toward an uptempo, NBA-style offense favored by NBA scouts and more suitable to the playing style of contemporary players. He also promised a more physical defense of the type that both Georgetown and the original Big East Conference had been known for in their 1980s heyday. He also told reporters that he thought he could improve Georgetown's recruiting efforts by offering players an easier path to the NBA, which he believed he understood better than most college coaches.\nSeason recap.\nGeorgetown had lost seven players – including its five top scorers – since the conclusion of the previous season. Among those departing were the team's two top scorers of 2016–2017, senior guard Rodney Pryor and junior forward L. J. Peak; Pryor graduated in 2017 after a single season with the Hoyas, and Peak declared for the 2017 NBA draft, foregoing his senior year of college. Starting center Bradley Hayes and power forward Reggie Cameron II graduated in 2017. Junior forward Isaac Copeland had transferred to Nebraska in mid-season, and redshirt junior forward Akoy Agau, after a single season of action with the Hoyas and with two seasons of college eligibility remaining, transferred to SMU during the offseason. Junior guard Tre Campbell left the team after 2016–2017 for personal reasons and, although he remained on scholarship and enrolled at Georgetown for his senior year, he was not on Georgetown's roster and sat out the 2017–2018 basketball season. Another loss was Tremont Waters. Georgetown had lacked a true point guard since the graduation of Markel Starks in 2014, and John Thompson III had attempted to address that by recruiting Waters in the fall of 2016, but Waters had withdrawn his commitment to Georgetown in March 2017 amid the turmoil that surrounded the Georgetown men's basketball program in the aftermath of the 2016–2017 team's losing season. Ewing attempted to re-recruit Waters, but ultimately failed when Waters committed to LSU in early June 2017.\nSenior Jonathan Mulmore and sophomore Jagan Moseley at guard, junior guard/forward Kaleb Johnson, junior forward Marcus Derrickson, and junior center Jesse Govan all returned for another year. Senior forward Trey Mourning, the son of Georgetown great Alonzo Mourning, rumored to be considering a transfer at the end of the previous season, also decided to return for 2017–2018, although he suffered a knee injury that forced him to sit out the entire season. The team's former student manager, senior guard Ra'Mond Hines, made the team as a walk-on for the third straight year, while sophomore forward George Muresan, the son of former NBA player Gheorghe Muresan, made the team as a walk-on for a second straight year.\nFour freshmen – guard Jahvon Blair, forwards Jamorko Pickett and Antwan Walker, and 7-foot-3 (221-cm) center Chris Sodom – joined the team. Two upperclassmen also arrived: Redshirt senior guard Trey Dickerson came to Georgetown from South Dakota as a graduate transfer, eligible to play immediately, while senior guard Greg Malinowski transferred to Georgetown from William and Mary; Malinowski had to sit out the 2017–2018 season in accordance with NCAA rules for transferring players, but planned to play for Georgetown as a redshirt senior in 2018-2019.\nThe 2017-2018 squad faced a rebuilding year in which it had arguably the lowest expectations of any Big East Conference team. A preseason poll of Big East coaches picked the Hoyas to finish ninth in the 10-team conference, while pundits raised the prospect of the Hoyas doing little better than winning a game or two against St. John's or DePaul and perhaps going winless in their 18 conference games. The most optimistic projections had Georgetown finishing at 5–13 in the Big East.\nNonconference schedule.\nDuring the head-coaching tenures of John Thompson Jr. and Craig Esherick in the original Big East Conference between 1979 and 2004, Georgetown developed a reputation for scheduling weak non-conference opponents, but during his 13 seasons as head coach at Georgetown between 2004 and 2017, John Thompson III had sought early challenges for his teams during the non-conference portion of the schedule, scheduling ranked opponents, early-season tournaments featuring nationally prominent teams, and distant travel so that his teams could prepare for the Big East Conference season by gaining experience against challenging opponents while facing a demanding travel schedule. Ewing scrapped John Thompson III's approach, returning to the earlier philosophy of arranging a weak early-season schedule. On August 2, in accordance with Ewing's wishes, Georgetown withdrew from the PK-80–Phil Knight Invitational, a high-profile, 16-team, two-bracket tournament in Portland, Oregon, scheduled for November 23–26, in which the Hoyas would have opened with a game against Michigan State, a preseason Top Five team, then faced either Connecticut or 2017 Final Four participant Oregon in the second round the following day, and finished two days later with a final game against Arkansas, North Carolina, or Portland. Big East rival DePaul replaced Georgetown in the tournament. Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed issued a statement explaining the withdrawal, saying \"The Georgetown's men's basketball program is in the midst of an exciting time of rebuilding. Georgetown has a prominent, seasoned head coach who has begun this process, which will continue to develop in the fall.\" The withdrawal reportedly left Georgetown with nine or ten open slots left to fill in its 2017-2018 schedule, which CBS Sports′ Matt Norlander described on August 2 as \"an enormous amount of open dates for a Big East program to fill this deep into the offseason.\" But Ewing saw no need to pit his team against some of the toughest teams in the United States during his first season as head coach, explaining his decision to withdraw this way: \"“It’s my belief that, why go out there and get my ass kicked to show my recruits that we need their help when I can stay home and watch other people get their butts kicked...Do my recruiting, keep on telling the people we need that we need them, recruit them, and do my job to help my team, build them up and show them what my visions are of them, and win as many games as we can.” Later in August, Ewing also threw cold water on the idea of renewing Georgetown's rivalry with Maryland any time soon. After not meeting in a non-tournament game since 1993, the Hoyas and Terrapins had met in a home-and-home series over the past two seasons as part of the annual Gavitt Tipoff Games between the Big East and Big Ten conferences, Maryland winning both games in tight contests, raising hope among fans in the Washington, D.C., area that Georgetown-Maryland meetings would become annual events. On August 24, however, Ewing told the press, \"I’m not thinking about Maryland. I’m not sure if or when we will schedule Maryland. My focus is on getting us back strong.” The Hoyas did not participate in the Gavitt Tipoff Games in 2017, and Maryland was not on Georgetown's 2017–2018 schedule. Discussing his scheduling philosophy in August with \"The Washington Post\", Ewing said, “The Big East schedule is going to be tough enough to handle. It’s always been tough. It was tough when I was playing. So, you know, you don’t have to play the toughest nonconference schedule. It’s all about where you end up at the end. . .Do the best job that we can in the Big East and let the chips fall where they may. And hopefully we’ll be able to be in the NCAAs and do our work there.”\nGeorgetown released its 2017–2018 schedule on September 12, and it immediately provided one of the main narratives of the season. The non-conference schedule included no tournaments, and the average RPI of non-conference opponents for the season was a lowly 265.1. The opponents for 2017–2018 and their 2016–2017 RPI rankings among the 351 NCAA Division I teams were Richmond (72), Syracuse (86), Mount St. Mary's (137), Maryland Eastern Shore (279), Jacksonville (305), Maine (323), Coppin State (336), North Texas (338), Howard (339), North Carolina A&amp;T (350), and Alabama A&amp;M (351). Maine was picked to finish last in the America East Conference in a preseason poll of the conference's coaches, had not won more than eight games in any of the previous four seasons, and had not had a winning season since 2009-2010. Four of the teams were from the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference (MEAC), ranked 31st among the 32 Division I conferences during the 2016–2017 college basketball season, and none of those four were among the top five MEAC teams of 2016–2017; moreover, MEAC coaches in a preseason poll picked North Carolina A&amp;T – which had posted a 3–29 record the previous season – to finish last in the conference. Overall, Georgetown's opponents had gone 116–230 (.335) against Division I schools during 2016–2017; five of them had failed to win 10 games all season, while one had won 10. The contractually obligated Syracuse game – part of a two-season home-and-home series between the former archrivals in the original Big East Conference – provided Georgetown with its only truly challenging non-conference game, and even then Syracuse was facing a down year in which pundits projected the Orange to finish next-to-last in the Atlantic Coast Conference. None of the schools had received an at-large bid to the 2017 NCAA tournament – Mount St. Mary's, a 16th-seed in the tournament, was the only team among Georgetown's 11 non-conference opponents that made the tournament and did so via an automatic bid by winning the 2017 Northeast Conference tournament – and none of them were projected to make the 2018 NCAA tournament; preseason prognosticators raised the possibility that none of them would make even the 2018 National Invitation Tournament. Other than a visit to Richmond, the entire non-conference schedule was at home.\nPundits indulged in a chorus of criticism of Georgetown's nonconference schedule. Kerry Miller of Bleacher Report called the schedule \"terrible,\" observing that \"constructing a strong nonconference schedule for college basketball is an art form, and Georgetown is No. 1 on the list of teams that miserably failed that art class this year\" and that \"this might be the worst nonconference schedule in major-conference history;\" Miller offered the possibility that the Hoyas \"could be headed for an interesting dichotomy: Georgetown going 11-0 in nonconference play before going 0-18 in the Big East.\" Other basketball media members called the schedule \"embarrassing,\" \"pathetic,\" \"ridiculously weak,\" \"atrocious,\" \"among the worst non-conference schedule I have ever seen,\" \"perhaps the worst non-con[ference] schedule ever,\" and \"the worst non-conference basketball schedule ever.\" Critics also noted that even if the Hoyas had an unexpectedly strong showing in Big East play, the non-conference schedule's weakness would work against Georgetown when the selection committee for the 2018 NCAA Tournament made its picks the following March, virtually precluding Georgetown's consideration for the NCAA Tournament and even for the 2018 National Invitation Tournament. Ewing made no apologies for how he scheduled the team, dismissing concerns about the non-conference schedule by saying, \"It's all a work in progress. To me everything is a work in progress to get ready for the Big East. The Big East is where everything starts for me. The Big East is a make or break for us...My guys are coming off two poor years, and it is my job to mend their egos and to get them to believe in themselves again. The Big East is what it's all about. Get our guys believing in themselves and get ready for the Big East competition.\"\nRegardless of the debate over their schedule, the Hoyas began their season two months to the day after it was announced, on November 12, opening a three-game homestand by facing Jacksonville at Capital One Arena, as the Verizon Center had been renamed in August 2017. It was Ewing's first game as a head coach at any level, and in honor of the occasion Ewing's former college and NBA rival Michael Jordan, former Georgetown and NBA players Alonzo Mourning and Dikembe Mutombo, Washington Wizards and former Georgetown player Otto Porter Jr., Wizards head coach Scott Brooks, and Ewing's former New York Knicks coach and television analyst Jeff Van Gundy all were in the crowd, and Ewing told the press that his high-school coach also was at the game. The crowd cheered loudly when Ewing first walked onto the court about 10 minutes before the opening tipoff, and gave him an ovation when the spotlight fell on him during pregame introductions. The Hoyas held the Dolphins – who were coming off their first winning season in six years – to 23.3 percent shooting from the field in the first half and 32.7 percent for the game as Georgetown cruised to a 73–57 victory and Ewing's first head-coaching win. Jesse Govan led the Hoyas with a double-double (20 points and 15 rebounds), and Marcus Derrickson also scored 20.\nOver the next six days, the homestand continued with victories over Mount St. Mary's, which had not defeated Georgetown since 1961, and Maryland Eastern Shore, which was missing five players projected preseason as starters because of eligibility problems and other reasons. Against Mount St. Mary's, the Hoyas scored 102 points – their first 100-plus-point game since they scored 105 against South Carolina Upstate in their season opener the previous year – and Jesse Govan had his second straight double-double with 20 points and 14 rebounds, while Jahvon Blair contributed 19 points and five assists, Jagan Moseley scored 15 points and also recorded five assists, and Kaleb Johnson and Jamorko Pickett each had 14 points and seven rebounds. Three days later against Maryland Eastern Shore, Johnson scored a career-high 24 points, Govan had his third straight double-double (23 points and 14 rebounds), Marcus Derrickson had his third career double-double (14 points and 10 rebounds), Blair scored 12 points, and Jonathan Mulmore posted 10 points and recorded five assists.\nBeginning the season with a record of 3–0 for the first time since 2014–2015, the Hoyas traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to meet Richmond at the Robins Center a week later in Georgetown's only non-conference game of the season away from Capital One Arena; it was part of a home-and-home series in which Richmond would visit Georgetown the following season. Richmond, although only 1–3 on the season entering the game, had been a 2017 National Invitation Tournament quarterfinalist and as Georgetown's second-strongest non-conference opponent posed the biggest challenge thus far in Georgetown's young season. With former Georgetown head coach John Thompson Jr. making the trip and looking on from the stands, the Hoyas led by only 40–39 at halftime and had to fend off a Richmond surge in which the Spiders took a 59–57 lead with 9:26 left to play before pulling back ahead and hanging on for an 82–76 win. In a balanced Georgetown attack, Marcus Derrickson scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds, Jonathan Mulmore added 15 points and eight assists, Jessie Govan had 14 points and six rebounds, Jamorko Pickett scored 12 points and pulled down seven rebounds, and Kaleb Johnson added 11 points. The win gave Georgetown its first 4–0 start since the 2014–2015 season.\nBy the time the Hoyas returned to Capital One Arena on November 28 to begin an eight-game homestand by meeting Maine, their first five opponents had a combined record of 9–25 (.265) on the season, and two of them had won only one game. Georgetown defeated Maine – a team that was missing three of its starters and had a record of 1–6 entering the game – but the Hoyas′ strength of schedule fell to 348th or 349th, depending on the ranking system, out of 351 Division I teams. Georgetown followed up over the next 11 days with wins over Coppin State, Howard, and North Carolina A&amp;T. Georgetown cruised to easy wins in all four games, and the resulting 5–0, 6–0, 7–0, and 8–0 records for the Hoyas represented their first start with each of those records since the 2010–2011 season. The Coppin State game was the Hoyas′ fourth consecutive and fourth overall appearance in the annual BB&amp;T Classic, and they improved their all-time record in the Classic to 4–0, but by the time they had beaten Howard, their strength of schedule had fallen to 351st, the weakest among NCAA Division I teams. Jessie Govan scored 16 points and grabbed eight rebounds against Maine, then recorded three straight double-doubles – his fourth, fifth, and sixth of the season – with a season-high 26 points and a career-high 16 rebounds against Coppin State, 24 points against Howard in a game in which he tied his career best with 16 rebounds and also blocked three shots, and 22 points and 15 rebounds against North Carolina A&amp;T. Kaleb Johnson scored 18 against both Maine and Howard – in the Howard game on 6-for-6 shooting from the field, including 2-for-2 from three-point range, and a 4-for-4 performance from the free-throw line – and he finished with 10 points against North Carolina A&amp;T. Marcus Derrickson scored 12 points and went 6–for–6 in free throws against Maine and had 13 points against Coppin State, and he contributed 16 points and nine rebounds against Howard. Jamorko Pickett finished with 13 points against Coppin State and 12 against North Carolina A&amp;T. In the Maine game, Jonathan Mulmore scored 10 points and recorded five assists, while Jahvon Blair came off the bench to add 11 points.\nNorth Carolina A&amp;T's loss to Georgetown dropped the Aggies to 5–4, but they were the only team with a winning record the Hoyas had faced all season. Defeating North Carolina A&amp;T gave Georgetown an 8–0 record and made the Hoyas one of only six NCAA Division I teams without a loss during the season. However, Georgetown also had the weakest strength of schedule – 351st out of 351 – among Division I schools. By the time the Hoyas beat North Carolina A&amp;T on December 9, Georgetown's previous seven opponents were a combined 13-54 (.194) on the season, and the Hoyas′ previous three opponents (Maine, Coppin State, and Howard) had a combined record of 2–26 (.071). By December 15 – the eve of the Hoyas′ meeting with Syracuse – Georgetown's first eight opponents were a combined 24-64 (.273) on the season. The lackluster games resulted in lackluster attendance: The crowd of 9,212 for the season opener against Jacksonville left the 20,356-seat Capital One Arena less than half-full, and since then the Hoyas had averaged 5,247 fans per game and never had reached 6,500 for any game. When reporters again asked Ewing immediately after the North Carolina A&amp;T game about the unambitious schedule he had put together, he dismissed their concerns by saying, \"It's a great schedule, a great schedule. All the people worried about the schedule are all you guys.\"\nThe Hoyas had a week off before facing Syracuse, Georgetown's archrival in the original Big East, and during that week the letter \"S\" was \"prohibited\" on the Georgetown campus, being covered over or X-ed out everywhere it appeared on a sign. The game was Georgetown's only real challenge of the nonconference schedule, and it pitted Patrick Ewing against Jim Boeheim – Syracuse's head coach back in Ewing's playing days at Georgetown – as head coaches for the first time, prompting nostalgia about the early 1980s heyday of the original Big East Conference. Neither team led by more than five points during the first half, and the Hoyas held a 28–24 lead at halftime. Georgetown pulled out to a 53–40 lead in the second half before the Orange, led by freshman small forward Oshae Brissett – who scored only one point in the first half but 24 after halftime – began a comeback, going on a 5–0 scoring run to close the gap to 53–45 with 9:55 remaining in regulation. Georgetown still led 64–57 when Marcus Derrickson fouled out with 5:23 left in the second half. With a minute left in regulation, Syracuse sophomore guard Frank Howard stripped the ball from Jesse Govan and scored on a layup to tie the game 69–69, but then Syracuse missed three straight shots and the game remained tied at 69–69 at the end of regulation. Syracuse sophomore guard Tyus Battle led the Orange in overtime, scoring eight points after the end of regulation, including a three-pointer that put Syracuse ahead for good at 72–69. Syracuse, which had outscored Georgetown 29–15 after Derrickson fouled out, won 86–79, dealing the Hoyas their first loss of the season. The win snapped a two-game Orange losing streak against the Hoyas and was their first road win against Georgetown since 2011, while the Hoyas missed both their first chance to beat Syracuse three games in a row since a four-win streak between 2000 and 2002 and their only chance to pick up a quality win during their non-conference schedule. Both teams shot 10-for-27 (37 percent) from the field and both had 16 turnovers. Jessie Govan had 21 points and eight rebounds and logged a career-high 42 minutes, Jagan Mosely came off the bench to add 20 points, Marcus Derrickson had 14 points and eight rebounds, and Jamorko Pickett scored 12 points.\nOn December 19, Georgetown announced that freshman center Chris Sodom had been dismissed from the team for violating team rules; it later was revealed that his dismissal stemmed from his involvement in an off-campus altercation. Sodom had had little impact on the team, appearing in only six games and playing only 27 minutes as a Hoya, but his departure left Georgetown with a shortage of depth among its \"big men;\" with Sodom off the team, Ewing's only option for the rest of the season as a backup for center Jesse Govan and forward Marcus Derrickson became freshman forward Antwan Walker.\nThe Hoyas completed their non-conference schedule with two more home games, beating North Texas in the first meeting between the schools and then defeating winless Alabama A&amp;M. Against North Texas, with Ewing's former New York Knicks teammate John Starks looking on from the stands, Marcus Derrickson led the Hoyas with 17 points and Jessie Govan had his ninth career double-double and seventh double-double of the season with 12 points and 14 rebounds, while Jonathan Mulmore finished with 12 points and six assists. Three days later in the rout of Alabama A&amp;M – which entered the game with a record of 0–12 and ranked 344th in RPI among the 351 Division I schools – Antwan Walker made his first collegiate start and first appearance in a game since December 9, played a career-high 15 minutes and scored in double figures for the first time with 16 points on 6-of-7 shooting from the field and 4-for-4 from the free-throw line, while Jahvon Blair, making his second collegiate start, scored 13 points. Against Alabama A&amp;M, Jessie Govan had another double-double (11 points and 11 rebounds), his eighth of the season and the tenth of his career, while Jamorko Pickett and Kaleb Johnson added 10 points each.\nThe Hoyas completed their non-conference schedule with a 10–1 record, their best start to a season since they opened 10–1 in 2012–2013. However, their strength of schedule was 350th among the 351 teams after they defeated North Texas and fell to 351st and last after they beat Alabama A&amp;M. Sports pundits understood Ewing's desire to pad the team's schedule given its limited prospects for the season and its need to rebuild in terms of both talent and confidence. However, sports commentators also viewed the nonconference portion of Georgetown's schedule as harming the team's chances of making the NCAA Tournament even if it won most of its conference games, as well as poorly preparing the Hoyas for the rigors of the upcoming Big East season. They also saw it as a missed opportunity to market Georgetown's otherwise faded national brand by highlighting Ewing's return to the school via nationally noted nonconference games, such as those that might have occurred if Georgetown had not withdrawn from the November PK80-Phil Knight Tournament. On the eve of the Syracuse game, college basketball analyst Ken Pomeroy opined that the Hoyas would have to go an unexpected 12–6 in the upcoming Big East season to ensure an NCAA Tournament bid and that even an equally unexpected record of 11–7 might make it difficult for the selection committee to justify a bid. Asked by reporters after the Alabama A&amp;M game whether he felt his team was prepared for Big East play, Ewing was noncommittal, saying, \"That's yet to be determined. We just have to stay focused and continue to work hard. Even though we're, what, 10-1 right now, we can't be happy with that. We have to stay hungry. No one expects us to be successful, and we have to have a chip on our shoulder about that. We have to continue to grind. At the end of the year, we'll see where we lie.\"\nConference schedule.\nGeorgetown completed its eight-game homestand and opened its Big East season on December 27 with a 91–89 double-overtime loss to Butler, despite pulling out to a 20-point lead in the first half and holding a 42-24 lead over the Bulldogs at halftime; Marcus Derrickson (23 points and 11 rebounds) and Jesse Govan (19 points and 13 rebounds) both had double-doubles, and Jahvon Blair went 11-for-12 from the free-throw line and scored 17 points. The Hoyas then embarked on a two-game road trip in which they finished 2017 with a loss at Marquette and began 2018 with their first conference victory of the season in a game at DePaul. Derrickson scored 20 points at Marquette, and 24 at DePaul, while Kaleb Johnson finished with 12 points at Marquette and Jahvon Blair had a 15-point game against DePaul. Govan had double-doubles in both games, with 11 points and 12 rebounds at Marquette and 25 points and 12 boards at DePaul.\nGeorgetown returned to Capital One Arena for a one-sided loss to Creighton in which the Hoyas trailed from the opening basket and the Bluejays led by double figures from halfway through the first half through the end of the game; with 11 points, Jahvon Blair was the only Hoya to score in double figures, while Kaleb Johnson grabbed 10 rebounds. Three days later, Georgetown visited Madison Square Garden and defeated St. John's to improve to 2–3 in conference play; Govan had another double-double, scoring 18 points and pulling down 13 rebounds, Derrickson added 17 points, and Jagan Moseley contributed 13. With former St. John's head coach Lou Carnesecca in the stands, the two teams played a lackluster game that betrayed how far the two programs had fallen since their mid-1980s heyday in the original Big East Conference when Carnesecca coached the Red Storm, Ewing played for Georgetown, St. John's head coach Chris Mullin played for St. John's, and the two teams were national powers and faced off in nationally prominent games. However, the meeting was the first between Ewing and Mullin as head coaches, and the game also marked the return of Ewing to Madison Square Garden, where he had played with the New York Knicks in the NBA, and it prompted much nostalgia about both the old Big East and Ewing's 15-year Knicks career; the crowd cheered heartily for Ewing from the moment he came out onto the court and chanted \"Patrick! Patrick!\" as he exited after the conclusion of the game.\nIn their next game, the Hoyas faced a ranked opponent for the first time in the season when they traveled to meet No. 13 Seton Hall at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, on January 13, the first time they had gone without a ranked opponent until mid-January since the 2003-2004 season. Undefeated at home for the season at 10–0, the Pirates were celebrating the 25th anniversary of the 1992–1993 Pirates team that won both the Big East regular season championship and the 1993 Big East tournament, and that season's head coach, P. J. Carlesimo, and Artūras Karnišovas, general manager of the Denver Nuggets and a member of the 1992–1993 Seton Hall team, were in the audience. The Hoyas staked themselves to a 12–3 lead to start the game, but the Pirates took advantage of Georgetown turnovers to come back with a 29–10 scoring run in the final 11 minutes of the first half and go into the locker room with a 44–31 at halftime. In the second half, the Pirates pulled out to a 16–point advantage before the Hoyas cut Seton Hall's lead to 60–52 with eight minutes to play, but Seton Hall extended its lead to 62–52 with 6:29 left and to 69-54 with 3:28 remaining on the way to a 74–61 win. It was Seton Hall's fifth straight victory over Georgetown, and the Pirates improved their all-time record against the Hoyas to 47–57 – dating back to the first meeting between the schools on December 10, 1909 – and to 21–41 since the two teams joined the original Big East Conference as charter members in 1979. Marcus Derrickson led the Hoyas with 18 points, while Kaleb Johnson scored 14 points and Jahvon Blair and Jesse Govan had 11 each.\nFour days later, the Hoyas were at Capital One Arena to open a three-game homestand by playing another ranked opponent, No. 1 Villanova. It was the first time Ewing had faced Villanova in any capacity since the Wildcats upset the Hoyas in his final game as a college player to win the national championship in the 1985 NCAA tournament. The game quickly became a blowout, as Villanova went on an 18–0 scoring run to take a 31–8 lead in the first half. By halftime, when Villanova led 42–20, Georgetown had more turnovers (nine) than baskets (eight), and had shot only 8-for-26 (30.8 percent) from the field, including 0-for-8 in three-pointers. During the second half, Villanova continued to extend its lead, which reached its peak at 88–44 with about minutes remaining. With about minutes left, Villanova head coach Jay Wright took his starters out of the game, and with the Wildcats′ bench players on the floor, the Hoyas concluded the game with a 12–0 scoring run, closing to 88–56 at the final buzzer. For the game, the Wildcats shot 17-for-33 (51.5 percent) from three-point range, while the Hoyas shot only 4-for-15 (26.7 percent) from the beyond the arc. Jesse Govan, the only Georgetown player to score in double figures, finished with 12 points, and Trey Dickerson left the game with back spasms during the first half. It was Villanova's seventh straight victory over Georgetown, the Wildcats′ longest winning streak against the Hoyas since the schools first met in 1922. The 32-point loss was Georgetown's worst since December 10, 1974, when Maryland beat the Hoyas by 33 points, 104–71, and it dropped the Hoyas to 12–6 on the season, 2–5 in the Big East. Georgetown's easy non-conference schedule had inflated the Hoyas′ overall record and, when the press asked him what the game said about the true contrast between the state of the Georgetown's men's basketball program and that of a national power like Villanova, Ewing replied, \"I'm not even thinking about that. All I'm thinking about is that they're a good team and tonight was their night. That's it. . .I've had my butt kicked before – fortunately it was as a player – and all I can do is get ready for the next one. You can't dwell on it. Just got to look at the film and make adjustments and get ready for the next game.\"\nThe homestand continued with two close games in which the Hoyas completed a regular-season sweep of the series with St. John's in a double-overtime win but then lost to DePaul. Marcus Derrickson led the Hoyas against St. John's with 27 points, while Jesse Govan and Jamorko Pickett each scored 16, Jahvon Blair finished with 15 off the bench, Jagan Moseley came off the bench to contribute 12, and Trey Dickerson had a double-double (10 points and 11 rebounds); Dickerson scored all of his points in overtime, while Moseley scored seven of his points in the second overtime. In the DePaul game – which the Blue Demons won on the final possession for the second season in a row – Derrickson again led the team with 23 points, Jamorko Pickett had 19 points and eight rebounds, and Moseley finished with 10 off the bench. The Hoyas finished a 1–2 homestand with an overall record of 13–7 and a 3–6 Big East record.\nThree road games followed. At Creighton, facing a Bluejays team that was undefeated at home for the season, the Hoyas, one of the ten best free-throwing-shooting teams in the United States, shot 16-for-17 (94.1 percent) from the free-throw line, but nonetheless lost 85–77 as Creighton went 9-for-10 in free throws over the final 51 seconds; Jahvon Blair scored 21 points and Marcus Derrickson finished with 17. A week later, Georgetown visited No. 6 Xavier, the Hoyas' third game of the season against a ranked opponent, in a meeting of the Big East's two top rebounding teams. Xavier, the Big East's second-place team, clung to a 46–44 lead at halftime, and the game saw 20 ties and 21 lead changes, with neither team ever leading by more than five points. With 24.3 seconds left in regulation and Georgetown leading 86–82, Jagan Moseley fouled Xavier senior guard Trevon Bluiett as Bluiett made a three-pointer, and Bluiett sank the resulting free throw to tie the game at 86–86. As time wound down, Jahvon Blair had an open shot that could have won the game but, thinking that the Hoyas should hold the ball for the last shot, passed it up; when he did shoot, attempting a three-pointer with two seconds left to play, he missed badly, and the score stood at 86–86 at the buzzer. In overtime, the Musketeers scored no field goals, but they went 10-for-10 from the free-throw line, and Bluiett – who finished with a season-high 31 points – hit two free throws with 10 seconds left to clinch a 96–91 Xavier victory, the Musketeers′ sixth win in a row. It was Xavier's fourth consecutive defeat of Georgetown and the Musketeers′ seventh win in the past eight meetings between the schools. Jesse Govan, who had posted only 12 points and six rebounds in his last two games combined played a strong inside game in the first half against Xavier, scoring 17 points and grabbing six rebounds before halftime, and he scored 23 points to lead the Hoyas before fouling out early in overtime, while Derrickson had a double-double with 19 points and 15 rebounds; Jamorko Pickett scored 21 points, and Blair came off the bench to add 19. Three days later, the Hoyas′ losing streak reached four when they lost at Providence in a game in which Georgetown led 69-64 with 1:52 remaining but Providence closed out play with a 9–0 scoring run – during which the Friars sank four free throws in the final 4.2 seconds – to win 73–69. Govan equaled his career high by finishing with 27 points against the Friars and was the only Hoya to score in double figures, although Derrickson narrowly missed a double-double with nine points and nine rebounds. The four consecutive losses dropped Georgetown to 13–10 overall and 3–9 in the Big East.\nThe Hoyas returned home to meet Seton Hall at Capital One Arena and won their first game in three weeks, despite blowing a 17-point early-second-half lead; the Pirates took their first lead of the game at 69–67 with 5:36 left to play after a 10–0 scoring run, but Marcus Derrickson scored a game-winning deep three-pointer with 4.2 seconds remaining and the Hoyas hung on to win 83–80. Georgetown then traveled to face Butler and won again, snapping a four-game road losing streak. Derrickson had a double-double against the Pirates with 22 points and a career-high 18 rebounds, and against the Bulldogs he scored a career-high 27 points – his eighth 20-plus-point game of the season – on 11-of-13 (84.6 percent) shooting from the field. Jesse Govan scored 11 points against Seton Hall and against Butler had his twelfth double-double of the season with 17 points and 12 rebounds. Jamorko Picket had 18 points against Seton Hall and 10 at Butler, while Trey Dickerson, who was averaging only 3.5 points per game entering the Butler game, came off the bench against the Bulldogs to score a personal-best 12 points in the first half on the way to an 18-point game. It was the first time Georgetown had won consecutive games since the back-to-back victories over North Texas and Alabama A&amp;M in the latter half of December and the Hoyas improved to 15–10 on the season and 5–9 in the conference, but the 2017–2018 Georgetown squad would not win again.\nGeorgetown's season-ending losing streak began when, after an eight-day break in action, they returned to Capital One Area to begin a three-game homestand with their fourth game of the season against a ranked opponent, a rematch with Xavier, which had climbed to No. 4 in the Associated Press Poll. Georgetown led 40–38 at halftime and still led 50–47 in the second half when Xavier went on a decisive 12–0 scoring run to take a 59–50 lead with 12 minutes left to play. Jamorko Pickett tied a career high with 21 points to lead the Hoyas, sinking a career-high six three-pointers, while Jesse Govan finished with his 13th double-double of the season (18 points and 11 rebounds), Jahvon Blair scored 12 points, and Kaleb Johnson finished with 11, but Xavier outrebounded Georgetown 38–29, including 11–6 in offensive rebounds. Although the Musketeers′ leading scorer, senior guard Trevon Bluiett with 19.8 points per game, scored only two points – giving him a grand total of three points in his last two games at Capital One Arena – Xavier won 89–77, and for the second straight year, the Musketeers swept the season series with the Hoyas. Xavier improved its record to 8–2 against Georgetown since the two schools became charter members of the new Big East Conference in the 2013–2014 season. Georgetown, meanwhile, lost its seventh straight game against Top 25 teams dating back to the previous season, falling to 0–4 against them for the 2017–2018 season. The loss also guaranteed the Hoyas their third straight losing season in conference play.\nThe homestand continued with Georgetown losing its eighth straight game to Providence and losing in overtime to Marquette two days later in a game in which the Hoya defense gave up 18 three-pointers to the Golden Eagles. Jesse Govan scored the 1,000th point of his collegiate career and had a double-double (20 points and 11 rebounds) against Providence and finished with 25 points, nine rebounds, and five assists against Marquette. Marcus Derrickson had a double-double (11 points and 15 rebounds) against Providence and finished with 15 points in the Marquette game. Jamorko Pickett scored 12 against Providence, while Jagan Moseley came off the bench to score 12 against the Friars. Against the Golden Eagles, Jonathan Mulmore contributed 15 points and Jahvon Blair added 16 off the bench.\nThe Hoyas rounded out their regular season with a visit to No. 4 Villanova for their fifth and final game of the season against a ranked opponent. Marcus Derrickson, suffering from an injured right ankle, sat out the game. The Hoyas missed all nine of their three-point attempts in the first half and the Wildcats jumped out to a 15-point lead during the half that the Hoyas never really challenged. The teams went into the locker room at halftime with Villanova leading Georgetown 44–31, and Villanova cruised through the second half on the way to a 97–73 victory. The win was Jay Wright′s 413th as head coach of Villanova, tying him with Al Severance for the most wins as head coach in the school's history. Jesse Govan shot 10-for-15 from the field and 10-for-10 from the free-throw line to finish with 30 points, and Jamorko Pickett, the only other Hoya to score in double figures, added 10 points. The Hoyas finished in eighth place in the Big East with a conference record of 5–13, the first time they had finished with a losing conference record for three consecutive seasons since 1997–1998, 1998–1999, and 1999–2000. They completed the regular season with an overall record of 15–14.\nBig East tournament.\nWith a No. 8 seed in the 2018 Big East tournament at Madison Square Garden, Georgetown faced ninth-seeded St. John's in the first round. Both schools were charter members of the original Big East Conference when it was created in 1979, and it was their eighth meeting in the tournament since it began in 1980; it also was the second straight year that the schools had met in the first round of the Big East tournament. The Hoyas had swept the regular-season series with the Red Storm, but St. John's sophomore point guard Shamorie Ponds, who was the Big East's leading scorer with 26.1 points per game and had averaged 29 points during his last seven games but had missed the Red Storm's final two regular-season games with an abdominal strain, returned to action in time to face the Hoyas. Neither team defended well during the first half, and Georgetown led 48–42 at halftime, but in the second half the Red Storm's defense clamped down, allowing the Hoyas to shoot only 26 percent from the field after halftime. St. John's took the lead for good with an 8–0 scoring run that gave the Red Storm a 67–59 lead with 9:11 left to play. With a balanced attack led by Ponds's 26 points, St. John's shot 53 percent from the field for the game and the Hoyas never got closer than five points the rest of the way. Winning 88–77, St. John's upset the Hoyas, knocked Georgetown out of the Big East tournament in the first round for the second straight year, and advanced to face Xavier in the quarterfinals. Jesse Govan had a double-double (28 points and 11 rebounds), but scored only eight points in the second half, while Marcus Derrickson returned to action to score 20 points, but the other three Georgetown starters – Jamorko Pickett (two points), Jonathan Mulmore (four points) and Kaleb Johnson, who went scoreless – who were averaging a combined 23.8 points per game for the season entering the Big East tournament, contributed only a total of six points, shooting 1-for-11 (9.1 percent) from the field.\nWhen reporters asked Ewing to reflect on the season in the immediate aftermath of the loss, he replied, \"“Right now it’s hard to reflect on it. I just have a bitter taste in my mouth right now. So I’m going to take a couple days and reflect. Depending on what happens, see if we’re going to get a chance to continue to play and then reflect on it and see — and make that decision. But right now it’s hard to say.”\nWrap-up.\nGeorgetown's season ended with a five-game losing streak and an overall record of 15–15. For the third straight season, the Hoyas never made the Top 25 in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches Poll – the first time that had happened in three consecutive seasons since 1997-1998, 1998-1999, and 1999-2000. By winning half their games, the Hoyas avoided a third straight losing season, but it nonetheless was the first time Georgetown had three consecutive non-winning seasons since 1971–1972, 1972–1973, and 1973–1974. Having lost their last five games, nine of their last 11, and 11 of their last 14, the Hoyas were left to hope for a bid to the 2018 National Invitation Tournament – which Ewing said Georgetown would accept – but no invitation came; it was the first time the Hoyas had received an invitation to neither the NCAA Tournament or the NIT in three consecutive seasons since 1972, 1973 and 1974.\nJesse Govan was the team's leading scorer for the year; he started all 30 games, shooting 50.8 percent from the field, averaging 17.9 points and leading the team with 10.0 rebounds per game. Marcus Derrickson started all 29 games he played in, and he averaged 15.9 points and 8.1 rebounds per game, shooting 52.6 percent from the field overall and 46.5 percent from three-point range. Jamorko Pickett played in every game, starting 28 of them, shooting 36.3 percent in field-goal attempts and 35.7 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 9.6 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Jahvon Blair played in all 30 games and started two of them, averaging 9.0 points per game on 33.2 percent field-goal shooting overall and 32.2 percent from three-point range, and he had 2.2 rebounds per game. Kaleb Johnson started all 30 games; he ended the season with a field-goal percentage of 54.2 – 34.0 from three-point range – and with per-game averages of 7.9 points and 4.2 rebounds. Jagan Moseley also played in every game and had one start, and he finished with 6.6 points and 2.8 rebounds per game, shooting 48.6 percent from the field and 38.9 percent from beyond the arc. Jonathan Mulmore started 29 of the 30 games he played in, and he averaged 5.6 points per game on 45.9 percent shooting from the field – 46.9 percent in three-point attempts – and grabbed 2.1 rebounds per game. Playing as a reserve in his only season as a Hoya, Trey Dickerson came off the bench in 27 games and averaged 4.4 points and 1.2 rebounds per game, shooting 42.7 percent overall and 27.5 percent in three-pointers. Antwan Walker made one start and came off the bench in 23 other games, averaging 2.7 points and 1.9 rebounds, and shot 49.0 percent from the field overall and 40.0 percent from three-point range. Before his dismissal, Chris Sodom appeared in six games, all as a reserve, and averaged 0.7 point and pulled down an average of 1.3 rebounds per game. Walk-ons Ra'Mond Hines and George Muresan each played in six games.\nJonathan Mulmore, Trey Dickerson, and Ra'Mond Hines all graduated in 2018. In his two seasons at Georgetown, Mulmore appeared in 62 games, starting 41, shooting 41.2 percent overall from the field and 41.0 percent from three-point range and averaging 4.6 points and 1.7 rebounds per game. In addition to his only year at Georgetown, Dickerson had played a season at Iowa and a season at South Dakota, and he finished his three-season college career having played in 76 games, starting 34 of them, shooting 40.3 percent from the field and 31.6 percent from three-point range and averaging 6.8 points and 1.5 rebounds per game. Hines, the Hoyas′ one-time student manager, had made the team for two seasons as a walk-on, playing a total of 22 minutes in 11 games, scoring three points and grabbing one rebound. Also graduating in 2018 was Tre Campbell, who had played guard as a freshman, sophomore, and junior on the Georgetown teams of 2014–15, 2015–16, and 2016–17, then left the team for \"personal reasons\" in August 2017. He remained enrolled at Georgetown and on scholarship during his senior year, sitting out the 2017-2018 basketball season with a year of college eligibility remaining. He announced on May 8, 2018, that after his graduation from Georgetown he would transfer to South Carolina where, as a graduate transfer, he would be eligible to begin play immediately in the 2018-2019 season.\nAnother player who left the team after the season was Marcus Derrickson. Talking to reporters at the end of the season-ending Big East tournament loss to St. John's, he had said he would return to Georgetown to play during his senior year, but he announced on April 9 that he instead had decided to forego his senior year of college and enter the 2018 NBA draft. He completed his three-season career at Georgetown having played in 89 games, starting 73 of them, averaging 10.3 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, and shooting 45.9 percent overall from the field and 39.7 percent in three-pointers. He went undrafted, but the Golden State Warriors signed him to play in the NBA Summer League. On April 11, Jesse Govan – who after the season's final game had, like Derrickson, declared an intention to return for his senior year – announced that he also would not return and would enter the NBA draft, raising the prospect of Georgetown losing two of its most experienced players and its top two scorers. However Govan did not hire an agent and, with his college eligibility therefore still intact, Georgetown announced on May 24 that he had withdrawn from the draft and would return for his senior year. Chris Sodom, dismissed from the team in December, decided to transfer to George Washington for the following season, a move which George Washington announced on May 30.\nWhen the season ended, Georgetown's RPI stood at 165, below the lowest RPI for a 2018 NCAA Tournament team (16th-seeded Radford′s 128), and well below the second-lowest RPI in the Big East (Marquette's 58). The team had played five games against ranked opponents and lost all five of them, the first time Georgetown had not defeated any of its ranked opponents since the 2003–2004 season. During the season, Georgetown's backcourt had struggled, but the Hoya frontcourt had shown great promise, with Marcus Derrickson, Jesse Govan, and Jamorko Pickett all impressing sports media figures and fans with their offensive prowess. Beginning with the Syracuse game and extending through the Big East season, however, the 2017–18 Hoyas showed a tendency to surrender leads during the second halves of games and \"looked nervous and unprepared in late-game situations;\" in six of its 13 Big East losses, as well as in its non-conference loss to Syracuse, Georgetown had blown a second-half lead. Its five conference wins had not come easily, either; it had won only one game by more than four points, its two regular-season wins over ninth-place St. John's had been very close, and the Hoyas′ wins in conference play seemed \"more about Georgetown surviving self-inflicted errors and hanging on for the victory than producing a good effort with solid play from start to finish.\" At least some observers blamed Georgetown's non-conference schedule for the team's apparent lack of preparedness for tough late-game situations and frequent inability to hold second-half leads. They also questioned the optics of Ewing's decision to opt out of the November PK80-Phil Knight Invitational and the lost opportunity to test the team against marquee opponents and signal Ewing's goal of rebuilding the team to national greatness that the withdrawal represented. Thus, the season ended as it began, centering around the narrative of the \"historically weak\" non-conference schedule Ewing had arranged.\nHowever, the season also ended amid reports that Georgetown had noted the deleterious effects of too weak a schedule both on team preparedness for conference play and on NCAA Tournament selection possibilities and would schedule more challenging opponents for the following season, including an early-season tournament. With the likelihood of a stronger schedule and of further player development, the return of Jesse Govan, the upcoming eligibility of redshirt senior shooting guard Greg Malinowski, and the anticipated arrival of four highly rated freshman recruits – guard Mac McClung, point guard James Akinjo, and forwards Josh LeBlanc and Grayson Carter – sports pundits even saw a possibility of Georgetown returning to the NCAA Tournament in 2019.\nRoster.\n\"Note: Chris Sodom was dismissed from the team in December 2017.\"\nSchedule and results.\nThe Hoyas were originally announced as a participant in the Phil Knight Invitational, but withdrew from the highly anticipated event in early August.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Big East regular season\n!colspan=9 style=\"background:#; color:white;\"| Big East tournament"

        "title": "Dylan Ferguson (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Dylan Ferguson (born September 20, 1998) is a Canadian professional ice hockey goaltender for HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL). Ferguson was originally selected 194th overall in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars before he was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights. He was born in Vancouver and grew up in Lantzville, British Columbia.\nPlaying career.\nFerguson played midget hockey in the Saskatoon Midget Hockey League with the Notre Dame Hounds as he was selected 166th overall by the Kamloops Blazers in the 2013 Western Hockey League (WHL) Bantam Draft. Ferguson played two more seasons with the Hounds before signing with the Blazers in 2015.\nFollowing his second season of major junior hockey with the Blazers in 2016–17, Ferguson was selected with the 194th overall pick in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Dallas Stars. However, he was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights on June 27 (only two days after he was drafted) with a second-round pick in the 2020 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Marc Methot.\nOn September 28, 2017, the Golden Knights signed Ferguson to a three-year, entry level contract. He began the 2017–18 season with the Blazers. However, on October 31, Ferguson was called up by the Golden Knights under emergency basis following a number of goaltending injuries. Ferguson made his NHL debut on November 14, in relief of Maxime Lagacé against the Edmonton Oilers in which he allowed one goal on two shots in 9:14 of playing time. Ferguson was returned to the Blazers on November 17 after the Golden Knights activated Malcolm Subban from injured reserve. As the Blazers failed to make a postseason run, the Golden Knights called up Ferguson as their third backup goalie during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs.\nFerguson returned to the Blazers for the 2018–19 season after attending the Golden Knights training camp. During the Blazers season-opening week, Ferguson was named the WHL Goaltender of the Week after he recorded a 1.00 goals-against-average and a 0.970 save percentage. Ferguson was assigned to the ECHL's Fort Wayne Komets to start the 2019–20 season, but also saw time with the Golden Knights' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Henderson Silver Knights.\nThe Golden Knights declined to issue a qualifying offer to Ferguson at the conclusion of his entry-level contract, making him an unrestricted free agent. Ferguson then signed a professional tryout agreement (PTO) with the Toronto Maple Leafs on August 11, 2022. After attending the Maple Leafs training camp and pre-season, Ferguson was re-assigned to join the Leafs' AHL affiliate, the Toronto Marlies, to begin the 2022–23 season on a PTO. Ferguson made five appearances with the Marlies before he was loaned to the Wichita Thunder of the ECHL on February 23, 2023. Before making an appearance with the Thunder, Ferguson was traded by the Marlies to the Belleville Senators of the AHL in exchange for future considerations on February 24. He was then signed to a two-way contract for the remainder of the season with Belleville Senators' NHL affiliate, the Ottawa Senators, on March 2, 2023.\nFerguson was recalled by Ottawa after registering a 5–1–0 record with Belleville after joining the team. Ferguson's first NHL start came on March 20, 2023 against the Pittsburgh Penguins in Pittsburgh. It was also his first NHL victory as he made 48 saves in a 2–1 win. He lost his second game of the season with Ottawa 5–3 to the New Jersey Devils on March 25. He was returned to Belleville on March 28 after goalie Cam Talbot became healthy enough to return to Ottawa's lineup.\nFollowing his brief tenure with the Senators, Ferguson left the organization as a free agent in the off-season. Unable to attract NHL interest, Ferguson opted to sign his first contract abroad in agreeing to a one-year contract with Belarusian club, HC Dinamo Minsk of the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), on July 28, 2023."

A maximum 30 men and 20 women could qualify. The qualification was based on the combined rankings (across all four tours) of 14 January 2018 (after the seventh World Cup event of the season, in St. Moritz). Competitors had to have competed in five different races on three different tracks during the 2016/17 season or 2017/18 season. Males had to be in the top 60 of the world rankings, while women needed to be in the top 45, after eliminating non-quota-earning competitors from countries that have earned their maximum quota. Each continent (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania) and the hosts were allowed to enter a competitor provided they meet the above standard. If any of these automatic places had gone unfilled, they were reallocated to unrepresented countries with qualified competitors in order of ranking. Thirty men were allowed to compete (maximum of three NOCs with three and six NOCs with two). Twenty women were allowed to compete (maximum of two NOCs with three, four NOCs with two).\nQualification timeline.\nRaces from October 15, 2017 until January 14, 2018 applied to qualification for the Olympics. In general this meant that the Olympic field is established by using the first seven world cup races of the 2017-18 season, but also includes results from Intercontinental, Europe, and America cup races. Four competitors were then allocated in both competitions, first for the host (if not already qualified), and then for continents not previously represented. If a nation refused a quota it was reallocated. Unused or reallocated spots were filled on January 19, 2018 by nations not previously entered.\nQuota allocation.\nThe following summary is a break down of Olympic qualification based on the IBSF rankings and adjustments, following reallocation. Numbers beside the nation indicate the rank of the sled that establishes the NOC's number of qualifiers.\nMen.\nFinal rankings by nation.\nWomen.\nFinal rankings by nation."

In addition, the Germans secured their second continental treble, becoming only the second European club to do so, and became the first team to claim any European competition with a 100% winning record. As winners, they earned the right to play against Sevilla, the winners of the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League, in the 2020 UEFA Super Cup, and also qualified for the 2020 FIFA Club World Cup in Qatar. They would go on to win both competitions. Since they had already qualified for the 2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage through their league performance, the berth originally reserved for the Champions League title holders was given to the team that was top of the 2019–20 Eredivisie (Ajax), the 11th-ranked association according to next season's access list, when it was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDue to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was suspended in mid-March 2020 and resumed in August. The quarter-finals onwards were played as single-match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal (Estádio da Luz and Estádio José Alvalade) behind closed doors from 12 to 23 August.

The last 8 of the competition would be played as a mini tournament, with the remaining fixtures to be played as single-legged ties. All remaining ties of the competition were played behind closed doors due to the remaining presence of the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.\nQualifying rounds.\nIn the qualifying rounds and the play-off round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2019 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into two-legged home-and-away ties.\nPreliminary round.\nIn the preliminary round, teams were divided into seeded and unseeded teams based on their 2019 UEFA club coefficients, and then drawn into one-legged semi-final and final ties.

AAA reached out to several promotions both in Mexico and around the world and arranged for six of the eight teams to come from outside AAA. Japanese wrestling promotions All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW) and Pro Wrestling Noah both sent teams. Both Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) and Ring of Honor (ROH), based in the United States, also sent representatives to the tournament, in each case bolstered by representatives of Lucha Underground, an AAA joint-venture project based on Los Angeles.

        "text": "The Boxing Siana Cup (Mississippi 1977.3.68 vase), is an Archaic vase that is part of the University Museums at the University of Mississippi. The vase is from the region of Attica and is dated to be around 560 BC – 550 BC. The design style of the vase is Attic black-figure and features a scene on the front and back of the cup and one on the interior. The artist of the vase is considered to be the Sandal Painter.\nVase shape.\nThe vase has a height of 0.13 meters and the diameter is 0.25 meters. The style of the vase is called a Siana cup. The Siana cup shape is derived from another form of pottery known as the Komast cup. Characteristics of the Siana cup include a large deep bowl, a high lip, a high conical foot, and a decorated tondo. The handles are mounted on each side of the cup.\nVase decoration.\nThere are two types of decoration styles often associated with the Siana cup; overlap and double-decker. The decoration of the Boxing Siana Cup falls under the overlap style. In this system of decoration, the main body and the lip of the cup are used together as one area for decoration. The design was created using the black-figure technique, which was a common practice for pottery during the time period the cup was created. The painted design consists of three different figural scenes.\nSide A.\nOne side of the vase, known as \"Side A,\" depicts two warriors fighting. The two fighters are identified as warriors by their attire. They both wear helmets that cover their entire face, which distinguishes the helmets as Corinthian. For protection, the warriors hold shields and wear greaves on their legs. In their other hand, the fighters each hold a spear as their weapon and carry a sword at their waist. Each of these elements is typical of Greek warfare. Instead of a traditional shield, the soldier on the right uses a tripod, as seen by the tripod leg protruding from the base of the \"shield\" and stretching across the soldier's body. Despite the few elements identifying the fighters as warriors, the two soldiers are otherwise nude. The warriors are surrounded by figures that are described as spectators. Four spectators stand to the left of the battle scene and three stand on the right. The spectators are in an alternating pattern of being nude or clothed in drapes.\nSide B.\nThe opposite side of the vase, called \"Side B,\" contains an image similar to side A. Instead of warriors, two men are depicted boxing. Following the same theme as Side A, the boxers are nude except for the items that identify them as boxers. The fighters' hands and wrists are wrapped in leather thongs, which is what boxers commonly used for protection during standard boxing matches. The goal of ancient boxing was to knock the other opponent out by striking his head and upper body multiple times. There was little use of footwork in Greek boxing. Instead, boxers would stand in a stationary lunge-like position and rely on twisting at their hips for momentum. The boxers on the Boxing Siana Cup reflect this style of fighting. The fighters are portrayed standing with their legs planted far apart and the motion of the fight scene is depicted through their arms. Both boxers have one arm thrusting forward in a punch and the other arm pulled back in preparation to deliver another jab. Each man aims for his opponent's head and upper body. Like Side A, the boxers are surrounded by spectators on either side, in the same alternating pattern of clothed and unclothed.\nInterior tondo.\nThe interior of the cup depicts a single youth who is running and looking over his shoulder. Like Sides A and B, the man performing the athletic event is nude. However, unlike the exterior of the cup the youth is not surrounded by spectators; he is the lone image on the tondo."

        "text": "The joint Philippine–Japanese–Indonesian bid for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup was the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas, Japan Basketball Association, and the Indonesian Basketball Association's successful bid for the right to host the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nThe campaign was led by the Philippines where most of the proposed venues are situated. The bid was one of the two finalist bids, along with the joint Argentina–Uruguay bid.\nBackground.\nBid Development.\nPhilippine-led initiatives.\nFollowing the failed bid to China, the Philippines as early as January 2016 expressed interest to make a joint bid for the 2023 FIBA World Cup with another country. The Philippines considered to make a joint bid with Malaysia, Singapore or South Korea.\nIndonesia as co-bidding country.\nThe bid was initially submitted as a joint bid by two countries; Philippines and Indonesia. It was submitted to FIBA on January 28, 2017 with the group stage proposed to be held in both countries and the Philippines solely host the final knockout phase.\nJapan joins the co-bidding.\nThe President of the Philippine Basketball Federation (SBP) Al Panlilio announced on February 6, 2017 that Japan was invited to join the Philippine-Indonesian bid. After the FIBA Board Meeting in May 2017 several media reported that Japan has joined the Philippine-Indonesian bid. Japan's participation in the bid was proposed by FIBA\nAccording to media reports Manila will be host to four Preliminary Round Groups, two Second Round Groups and the Final tournament phase from Quarterfinals onwards. As well Okinawa and Jakarta will each be host to two Preliminary Round Groups and one Second Round Group.\nSingapore.\nThere were plans to have Singapore as the fourth co-bidding country in the joint bid. On May 25, 2017 SBP officials had a dialog with their counterparts from the Basketball Association of Singapore (BAS) about joining the bid. If Singapore joined the each venue would have stage two Preliminary Round Groups and one Second Round Group.\nBid rationale and theme.\nThe bid focused on the passion for the game especially by fans from the primary hosting country, the Philippines, and the Consortium appealed to FIBA goal in growing the sport of basketball, with a combined population base of 500 million people. The bid revolved on the mottos \"The Power of Three\" and \"Play Louder than Ever\". Future infrastructure plans were also discussed during the bid presentation.\nProposed venues.\nSix venues from six host cities were proposed for the bid.\nBid evaluation and review.\nPhilippines.\nFrom October 21-22, 2017, a three-man evaluation commission consisting of FIBA Central Board Members Hamane Niang of Mali and Ingo Weiss of Germany, and FIBA Senior Consultant Lubomir Kotleba of Slovakia came to the Philippines having already evaluated the Russian and Argentina-Uruguay bids. The Philippine government through Foreign Affairs Secretary Alan Peter Cayetano and President Rodrigo Duterte assured the commission of its support in a 19 October meeting at the Manila Hotel.\nA bid presentation was held on October 21 at the Conrad Manila hotel in Pasay, Metro Manila. The bid which has the official slogan of \"Play Louder Than Ever\", was presented to the visiting FIBA commission.\nAmong those who spoke during the bid presentation are SBP Chairman emeritus Manny Pangilinan, SBP President Al Panlilio, and Foreign Affairs Secretary Cayetano. Consortium partners were also present during the bid presentation, with Japan Basketball Association Secretary-General Hirota Matsuhiro and Indonesian Basketball Association President Danny Kosasih, coming in with a staff of three.\nJapan.\nWhen FIBA officials made evaluations in Okinawa, Japan, they were presented blueprints and animated sketches of Okinawa Arena, the proposed Japanese venue for the FIBA Basketball World Cup which was then in the planning stages. It is planned to be ready for the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nBid presentation.\nThe final bid presentation was made in Mies, Switzerland with the host countries of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup announced on the same day. The joint Philippine-Japanese-Indonesian bid was favored by FIBA over Argentina and Uruguay's. However the two South American countries are given the chance to bid for the 2027 FIBA Basketball World Cup unopposed. They are to revise their bid according to FIBA's recommendations and represent their bid in June 2018. However Argentina and Uruguay decided to withdraw the bid for the 2027 edition."

        "title": "Baseball cheering culture in South Korea",
        "text": "The baseball cheering culture in South Korea started in the 1990s and continues to the present. There are 10 professional clubs and each club has its own way of cheering. The Korean cheering culture generally shares similar characteristics: collective, enthusiastic and empathetic. Baseball cheering is popular because of easy-to-learn fight songs, break-time events and a variety of foods. Baseball cheering is performed in most parts of a ballpark.\nCheering methods.\nFight songs.\nKorean baseball fight songs consist of the song for each club and songs for individual players. The fight song is a key element of Korea's baseball cheering culture. Cheering is done for the offence. Each batter has a personal fight song, sung when the batter enters the batter's box. The melodies of fight songs are taken from famous pop songs or K-pop songs, with lyrics rewritten to make it easy for the crowd to sing along. There are cell phone mobile applications that allow baseball fans to listen to the fight songs of clubs and players in advance.\nCheering tools.\nIn the early days of Korea's professional baseball league, which was started in 1982, the most commonly used cheering tools were Korean traditional musical instruments, such as Buk, Jing, and Kkwaenggwari. But nowadays, a typical example of a cheering tool is cylindrical, inflatable balloon sticks, now commonly known in the English-speaking world as thundersticks. They are used for cheering by beating a pair of balloon sticks together to make a loud sound. The first club in the world to introduce balloon sticks was the LG Twins. In the early 1990s they made balloon sticks out of polyethylene. It has been evolving and now it is recyclable, as the sticks can be inflated for use then deflated for storage until the next game.\nEach club has its own color for the balloon sticks: SK Wyverns is red, Samsung Lions is blue, Doosan Bears is white, Kia Tigers is yellow, LG Twins is red, Nexen Heroes is pink and Hanwha Eagles is orange.\nAnother interesting characteristic of Korean baseball cheering is fans wearing team uniform shirts with players' names. They wear this to feel a sense of belonging, solidarity and pride. Symbolic accessories and cheering tools play a similar role. There are stores in each stadium, so it is easy for supporters to buy cheer-related items.\nCheer leaders.\nThe Korea Baseball Organization did not have standardized cheering methods until the 1990s. It was the audiences who became the initiators of cheering. The initial ways of cheering were clapping and spontaneous singing. But in time, official cheer leaders appeared. Cheer leaders and cheer leading captain are the ones who take the lead. Each club has one captain and four or five cheer leaders. Cheer leaders dance to the chant the captain is making. Basically, they start cheering with the club's fight songs, but sometimes they lead the cheering using the latest K-pop songs.\nCheering features of each stadium.\nFoods.\nEach stadium has specialty food associated with cheering. A typical example of baseball stadium food is \"Chimaek,\" which is fried chicken and beer. There are various kinds of cheering foods featured at each ballpark. These are often the representative foods of the region where the ballpark is located. In Daegu Samsung Lions Park, there are Napjak Mandu (flat grilled dumplings), Samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) and kebab. In Busan Sajik Stadium, Buljokbal (spicy Jokbal), Bulgopchang (spicy Gopchang) and fast foods such as hamburgers and fried chicken. In Seoul Jamsil Stadium, Jokbal (pig's trotters), in Gwangju Kia Champions Field, Garak Guksu (boiled thin noodles in dried anchovy broth), in Hanwha Life Insurance Eagles Park, in Jinmi Tongdak and in Suwon KT Wiz Park, chicken.\nCheering zones.\nEach baseball stadium has its sections of unique themed seats. Incheon Munhak Baseball Stadium has a \"T Green Zone\", \"Happiness Zone\", \"Skybox Zone\", and \"Barbecue Zone.\" \"T Green Zone\" is located on the grassy hillside which is available to set up a tent or lay a mat. This zone is recommended to family audiences because it is not too crowded and there is a kid's park near by. \"Happiness Zone\" is located at the backstop and the seats are equipped with tables. \"Barbecue Zone\" can accommodate up to 200 people at once. It is Korea's first stadium to provide fans a way to cook meat while watching baseball. At the store inside the stadium they sell meat and lend grills. \"Skybox Zone\" is located indoors, so watching baseball game isn't restricted by bad weather. Lastly, there is a \"Homerun Couple Zone\" in the outfield bleachers. Many couples enjoy dating there.\nJamsil stadium's \"Exciting Zone\" allows fans to see players close up, but as this zone is close to the playing field, audiences have to be cautious about safety and borrow a helmet.\nSuwon KT Wiz park has a \"Hite Pub\" and \"Playstation Lounge.\" \"Hite Pub\" is Korea's first sports pub and the cost of one glass of beer and food is included in the ticket price. In the \"Playstation Lounge\" audiences can enjoy the match in the assigned room in which a PlayStation is equipped.\nDaejeon Hanwha Life Insurance Eagles Park has an \"Outfield Lawn Seat\" and \"Outfield Fieldbox.\" At the \"Outfield Lawn Seat\", audiences can enjoy the game with the feeling of a picnic. The \"Outfield Fieldbox\" is where audiences can watch the game from seats inside the box. Busan Sajik Stadium has a \"Rocket Battery Zone.\" There, people can enjoy the baseball game and camping at the same time, so it is recommended to family fans. These two stadiums both have an \"Exciting Zone.\" This zone is close to the ground so audiences can enjoy the players’ dynamic game. It can be interesting to watch the game at ground eye level, but as many foul balls fly toward the seats, children are not allowed to enter as it could be somewhat dangerous.\n\"Tigers Family Seat\" is most famous at Gwangju Kia Champions Field. There are seats and tables for four to six people, so audiences can watch the game comfortably. Masan Sports Complex Baseball Stadium has the \"Dinos Mattress Seat.\" Audiences can watch the game lying on comfortable mattresses. They can borrow a parasol and beach towel. And there is a unique stand made up of wooden decks. It is for family audiences and can accommodate six people. Audiences can party there, and no one complains about making noise.\nCheering cultures of each club.\nThe clubs of the Korean professional baseball league each have a unique cheering culture. Fans of the Lotte Giants use newspapers and orange plastic bags as cheering tools. Newspapers are rolled up and swayed in the air. People wear plastic bags on their heads, some knotted to look like Mickey Mouse ears. The plastic bags were initially intended to handle garbage, but the supporters started to use them as a cheering tool. The Lotte Giants also have unique chants, such as 'Azura' and 'Ma'. 'Azura' is a dialect word, implying 'yield a foul ball/home run ball to children', and 'Ma' is a dialect for calling children, implying 'throw the ball forward' (used when the pitcher throws to first base to check a runner). In response to 'Ma', supporters of other clubs make a counter-chant such as 'Wa' (a dialect of 'why').\nHanwha Eagles went through a decline of organized cheering starting in 2009. This led many baseball fans to start cheering for visiting teams. The Hanwha Eagles are trying to figure out how to keep track of the new trends and revitalize their fan base. They started to use Fanbots, a cheering robot made as part of the social cheering campaign for fans who want to support the team but cannot attend the games in person. Anytime, anywhere, if people upload a cheering message via web or mobile, the message is sent to a Fanbot in real time and to be displayed on the board Fanbot is holding. The Hanwha Eagles are the first club to use Fanbots.\nThe biggest feature of the Doosan Bears is that there are many fans who go cheering at away games. In addition, the percentage of female audience members is high. In the 2015 season, the percentage of female audiences was 43 percent for all teams, while for the Doosan Bears, it was 53 percent. For this reason, Doosan Bears is the only team in the league to have separate parts for the male and female in cheering songs.\nThe KIA Tigers have their base in Gwangju, so they have many fans in Jeolla-do. They support the team regardless of their performance. The LG fans are similar in this regard. The official Kia Tigers team color is red but they use yellow balloon sticks for cheering. Some fans call the yellow balloon sticks a 'pickled radish'.\nGlobalization.\nKorea's baseball cheering culture has been observed to be spreading to other nations. The fight song for Eric Thames is one example. Thames, who had been a member of Korea's Changwon NC Dinos (2014–2016), returned to U.S. Major League Baseball with the Milwaukee Brewers in 2017. His Korean theme song was played when he came to bat for Milwaukee. The song resounded through the Milwaukee stadium. His teammates, who did not know about the idea of personal fight songs, showed interest and hummed its melody.\nChallenges.\nCrisis.\nRecently the issue of copyright for club chants or fight songs has emerged. Clubs want to make their song legitimate and are negotiating with the original copyright holders to use the fight songs familiar to the fans, but as the legal wrangling is ongoing, the clubs have either made some changes to the songs or used the songs without license to do so. The copyright owners for the original songs have prepared class action lawsuits.\nTraditionally, the fight songs of each club were created without thought to the original copyright holder. The song would be altered by changing the lyrics, but this violates the author's intellectual property. South Korean copyright law largely protects both the author's property rights and moral rights. Property rights refer to the rights to the media that is owned by the creators. Usually, content producers are paid for allowing others to use their creation. Moral rights in South Korea are related to the issue of the creator's psychological profit. This includes the right to maintain the identity of the content. This means that anyone using the author's creation must not change its original form. However, the clubs usually modify the original lyrics or tune. Therefore, even though the clubs often pay a large sum for the author's property rights, the fight songs violate the author's moral rights.\nCriticism.\nKorea's baseball cheering culture is largely considered to be positive, but some issues have arisen over the course of its development. First is the \"Azura Culture\", the cheering culture of the Lotte Giants. This culture is semi-coercive rather than voluntary. Initially, this culture began with the expectation that if adult spectators pass a foul or home run ball to a child, the conflicts between the adults to get the ball might decrease. This culture also has the purpose of presenting a child with a good memory of watching a baseball game.\nHowever, in the coercive atmosphere, there are a few audiences with bad manners who take the ball away from the teenagers. As a result, there is a growing criticism about whether \"Azura Culture\" is truly a good one. There is an ongoing debate online. Some even refer to \"Azura Culture\" as \"robbery in the baseball stadium\". As people give the ball to the child before shouting \"Azura\", the excitement of shouting it is decreasing.\nRecently, other criticisms have been raised. Boisterous cheering culture makes watching the baseball game more joyful, but for some people who want to watch the game quietly, it is annoying. Residents neighboring the ballpark also suffer from the noise. Residents living in the apartment near Kia Champions Field Ball Park sued Gwangju city and the Kia Tigers club. As Korea's ballparks are located near very populated regions, it seems to be necessary to resolve the conflict between local residents and the baseball field."

        "text": "The 2018 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2017–18 season and the culmination of the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion Washington Capitals defeated the Western Conference champion Vegas Golden Knights four games to one to win their first championship, in their 44th season. The Vegas Golden Knights made the Finals in their first season, while this was the second Finals appearance for the Capitals. This was the first Finals series since 2007 where neither team had previously won the Stanley Cup and the third consecutive year in which a Western Conference team made their Finals debut. This was the first Finals since 2014 to require fewer than six games. Washington captain Alexander Ovechkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs.\nThe series began on May 28 and ended on June 7. The Vegas Golden Knights had home ice advantage in the series since the Golden Knights won the Pacific Division with 109 points during the regular season, while the Capitals won the Metropolitan Division with 105 points.\nPath to the Finals.\nWashington Capitals.\nThis was Washington's second Finals appearance; the Capitals were swept in four games by the Detroit Red Wings in 1998.\nThe Capitals did not make many major offseason transactions with the exception of signing forward Devante Smith-Pelly. Major re-signings during the off-season included forwards T. J. Oshie, Evgeny Kuznetsov, and Andre Burakovsky; and goalie Philipp Grubauer. Washington then re-signed Lars Eller during the season. The team was conservative during the trade deadline. Wanting to make a Stanley Cup run with the core players that they already had, they only acquired defencemen Michal Kempny from the Chicago Blackhawks and Jakub Jerabek from the Montreal Canadiens.\nThe Capitals finished the regular season with 105 points (49–26–7), winning their division. Left winger and team captain Alexander Ovechkin was the winner of this season's Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard Trophy, leading the league with 49 regular-season goals. Kuznetsov led the team in assists with 56.\nIn the first round of playoffs, Washington came back from a 2–0 series deficit to win four in a row and beat the Columbus Blue Jackets in six games. The Capitals then won a six-game series against their division rival and two-time defending champion Pittsburgh Penguins, whom the Capitals had beaten in a playoff series only once in ten previous attempts since 1994; losing the last seven prior series to them. The Penguins had eliminated Washington from the playoffs in the second round the previous two years. Washington then defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Finals in seven games, winning game seven on the road for only the second time in franchise history and first since 2012.\nVegas Golden Knights.\nVegas became the first expansion team since the 1967–68 St. Louis Blues to make the Stanley Cup Finals in their inaugural season. However, the 1967–68 expansion was structured so that an expansion team was guaranteed to make the final. By contrast, the Golden Knights entered the season as long shots to make the postseason, let alone the Finals, with sources like Deadspin and \"Newsweek\" predicting that the Golden Knights would be among the worst teams in the league. However, the Golden Knights exceeded even the most optimistic projections to turn in one of the strongest debut seasons for an expansion team in North American professional sports history.\nLas Vegas was awarded as the NHL's 31st franchise on June 22, 2016, to begin to play for the 2017–18 season. On April 13, 2017, the team announced the hiring of their inaugural head coach, Gerard Gallant. The team then participated in the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft on June 21, selecting an available player from all of the other 30 NHL teams. Some notable selections included goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who had won three Stanley Cups as a member of the Pittsburgh Penguins, winger James Neal from the Nashville Predators, and Jonathan Marchessault from the Florida Panthers. Fleury was left exposed by the Penguins because of the emergence of Matt Murray. The Panthers, who had salary cap issues, traded Reilly Smith to the Golden Knights in exchange for Vegas selecting Marchessault.\nThe team started winning, despite Fleury being injured for most of the first months of the season. The team relied on four other goaltenders while their starter was injured. Instead of being sellers trying to unload players with one-year contracts by the trade deadline, Vegas became surprise buyers, acquiring Ryan Reaves from the Penguins and Tomas Tatar from the Detroit Red Wings.\nOn March 26, 2018, Vegas became the first team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season in the league since the Edmonton Oilers and Hartford Whalers in the 1979–80 season. Following that achievement, on March 31, Vegas became the first modern-era expansion team from any of the four major sports and the first NHL team since the 1926–27 New York Rangers to win their division in their inaugural season (excluding the 1967–68 Philadelphia Flyers, as all teams in the West Division that year were expansion teams). The Golden Knights ended up finishing the regular season with 109 points (51–24–7). In the playoffs, Vegas swept the Los Angeles Kings in four games, defeated the San Jose Sharks in six games, and eliminated the Winnipeg Jets in the Western Conference Finals in five games.\nWith Vegas' trip to the 2018 Finals, a brand-new team in the league has now reached the Stanley Cup Finals every 50 years dating back to 1918. The Toronto Arenas reached the 1918 Stanley Cup Finals and won the Cup, but this was the first year of the new NHL (after every team except the Toronto Blueshirts left the National Hockey Association). The St. Louis Blues reached the 1968 Stanley Cup Finals and got swept by the Montreal Canadiens. However, the Blues and five other brand-new expansion teams all entered the league at the same time and were all placed in the West Division, with the Original Six comprising the East Division. The playoffs were structured so that one of the newly minted teams was guaranteed a berth in the Finals. In contrast, the Golden Knights were the first true expansion team in NHL history to advance all the way to the Finals while not playing in an all-expansion division.\nThe Golden Knights were only the second captainless team since 1973 to be in the Finals, and the first since the New York Rangers in 2014.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nBoth teams scored twice in the opening period. The first goal came from Vegas Golden Knights defenceman Colin Miller whose slap shot went past Capitals goaltender Braden Holtby. Washington struck back later in the period as both Brett Connolly and Nicklas Backstrom scored 42 seconds apart. William Karlsson then snuck the puck in between Holtby and the left post to tie the game. Early in the second period, a rebound off the glass came to Deryk Engelland who passed to an open Reilly Smith firing one past Holtby. Capitals defenceman John Carlson tied up the score after some nice passing from the defender and T. J. Oshie left himself wide open for the goal. In the third period, Tom Wilson redirected Alexander Ovechkin's shot past Vegas goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury to take the lead in the game. However, Vegas responded 1:41 later as Ryan Reaves went top-shelf to tie the game yet again. This goal proved to be controversial, as Ryan Reaves illegally cross-checked John Carlson to get into position to score. Tomas Nosek was able to score for Vegas later in the period, taking the pass from Shea Theodore. Vegas kept the lead in the penultimate minutes, grabbing an empty-net goal in the final minute to finish the game 6–4.\nGame two.\nDuring the first period of game two, James Neal took a pass from Luca Sbisa, firing a wrist shot past Braden Holtby. The Capitals tied the game during a four-on-four when Lars Eller shot into an empty net from Michal Kempny's pass. During the second period, Golden Knights rookie Alex Tuch was penalized for cross-checking, and on the ensuing power-play, Capitals captain Alexander Ovechkin fired a shot from a tight angle to give Washington the lead. Brooks Orpik extended the Capitals' lead to two goals when his shot deflected off Alex Tuch past Marc-Andre Fleury. Vegas cut the deficit by one goal when T. J. Oshie interfered with Colin Miller and Shea Theodore scored on the power-play. In the third period Holtby backstopped Washington to the victory, stopping the final fifteen shots from Vegas to win 3–2.\nGame three.\nAfter a tense first period in which neither team scored, Alexander Ovechkin scored early in the second period to give Washington the lead. Evgeny Kuznetsov, who was believed to have suffered an arm injury the game prior, scored 11:40 after Ovechkin, extending Washington's lead to two. Tomas Nosek scored off of a Braden Holtby giveaway to cut the deficit in half early in the third period. However, 10 minutes later Shea Theodore mishandled the puck in his own zone and Jay Beagle capitalized on the error, making a pass to an open Devante Smith-Pelly who restored the two-goal lead for Washington. The Capitals played defensively for the final minutes of the game to win 3–1, and took the series lead.\nGame four.\nDuring the first period, a penalty called on Colin Miller for tripping allowed T. J. Oshie to give Washington the first lead. The Capitals extended the lead after Evgeny Kuznetsov fed a pass to Tom Wilson who fired a wrist shot past Marc-Andre Fleury. Devante Smith-Pelly then gave Washington a 3–0 lead after a pass by Matt Niskanen deflected off Vegas forward Jonathan Marchessault to the stick of Smith-Pelly, who scored top-shelf on Fleury. Even with the Golden Knights more than doubling the shots of Washington, John Carlson gave the Capitals a 4–0 lead, firing a slap shot on the power-play. In the third period, Vegas ended the shutout as James Neal scored just as Evgeny Kuznetsov's tripping penalty had expired. Reilly Smith cut the deficit to two goals, scoring on the backhand past Braden Holtby. Washington restored a three-goal lead during a four-on-four; as Nicklas Backstrom fed an open Michal Kempny, firing the shot past Fleury. Brett Connolly added an insurance goal with less than two minutes remaining, giving the Capitals a commanding 6–2 lead.\nGame five.\nAlthough no goals were scored in the first period, the Capitals had the shot advantage nine to seven. During the second period, Tom Wilson passed to a speedy Jakub Vrana going past the Golden Knight's defender and beating Marc-Andre Fleury to take the lead. The Golden Knights tied the game soon after as former-Capitals defenceman Nate Schmidt shot through a flurry of players and the puck deflected off of Matt Niskanen past Braden Holtby. Alexander Ovechkin gave the Capitals the lead again on the power play, firing a shot onto Fleury, bouncing off his back and into the net. With the goal, it broke a tie with John Druce for most goals in a postseason by a Capitals player with fifteen. David Perron tied the game for Vegas, scoring his first goal of the postseason via deflection. Coach Barry Trotz of the Capitals challenged the play on goaltender interference as Perron appeared to hit the skate of Holtby as he was battling for position; the challenge was unsuccessful. An open Reilly Smith gave the Golden Knights the lead in the final minute of the second period, taking the pass from Alex Tuch. Halfway through the third period, Devante Smith-Pelly tied the game for the Capitals. Less than three minutes later, a shot came from the slot and went between Fleury's pads, but, unbeknownst to Fleury and his defensemen, the puck sneaked through and was lying in view just behind him, and Lars Eller forehanded it into the net to give the Capitals the lead with 7:37 left. With two minutes left, Vegas pulled Fleury for an extra attacker. At 18:11 of the third period, the game clock froze; however, the next stoppage in play occurred at 28.9 seconds remaining, allowing the clock to be readjusted. Nevertheless, the attempts of the Golden Knights were thwarted as the Capitals held on to win the game and their first Stanley Cup. Ovechkin was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy.\nTeam rosters.\nVegas Golden Knights.\nNote: \"Deryk Engelland served as the Golden Knights unofficial team captain during the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs.

Compared to the 2016 Challenge Series, three races were added: the Belmont Sprint Championship Stakes, the Highlander Stakes and the First Lady Stakes. The Gold Cup at Santa Anita, Belmont Oaks and Canadian Stakes were discontinued from the series.\nFifty pre-entrants in the 2017 Breeders' Cup qualified via the Challenge series, which was particularly important as seven of the Breeders' Cup races were oversubscribed. A maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Turf Sprint) are allowed to start in each race. Winners of the Challenge races are given automatic entries, while other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nA few challenge series winners could not compete at the 2017 Breeders' Cup due to injury or retirement. Two-time Eclipse Award winner Songbird qualified for the Distaff by winning the Ogden Phipps Stakes but was retired in August due to injury. Bal a Bali, winner of the Shoemaker Mile Stakes, was retired in October because he was not training at a high enough level.

        "title": "USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal",
        "text": "The USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal relates to the sexual abuse of hundreds of gymnasts—primarily minors—over two decades in the United States, starting in the 1990s. It is considered the largest sexual abuse scandal in sports history.\nMore than 500 athletes alleged that they were sexually assaulted by gym owners, coaches, and staff working for gymnastics programs across the country, including USA Gymnastics (USAG) and Michigan State University (MSU). Hundreds of them sued USAG, MSU, and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC, later USOPC), which settled the suits in 2018 and 2021 for a total of nearly $900 million. \nThe breadth of the abuses was first revealed by \"The Indianapolis Star,\" which reported in September 2016 that \"predatory coaches were allowed to move from gym to gym, undetected by a lax system of oversight, or dangerously passed on by USA Gymnastics-certified gyms\". Coaches and officials perpetrated, facilitated, or worked to conceal abuse in Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Rhode Island, Indiana, and elsewhere. FBI agents declined to investigate early allegations of abuse, then lied about it, according to a U.S. Justice Department report. Leaders of USAG, MSU, and the United States Olympic Committee (USOC, later USOPC) ultimately resigned; several coaches and officials faced criminal charges.\nA central figure was Larry Nassar, a national-team doctor for USAG and osteopathic physician in MSU's athletic department. More than 265 women said Nassar had sexually abused them under the pretense of providing medical treatment, including former USAG national team members Jessica Howard, Jamie Dantzscher, Morgan White, Jeanette Antolin, McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols, Gabby Douglas, Simone Biles, Jordyn Wieber, Sabrina Vega, Ashton Locklear, Kyla Ross, Madison Kocian, Amanda Jetter, Tasha Schwikert, Mattie Larson, Bailie Key, Kennedy Baker, Alyssa Baumann, and Terin Humphrey. In 2017 and 2018, Nassar pleaded guilty to federal charges of child pornography and state charges of first-degree sexual assault; he received sentences of 60 years in prison plus another 80 to 300 years.\nDozens of officials at USAG, USOC, and MSU resigned under pressure or were fired. Some faced criminal charges, though few were convicted. The scandal led to the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, which directed the creation of the U.S. Center for SafeSport. In 2018, MSU agreed to pay $500 million to settle lawsuits accusing university leaders, including its president and athletic director, of enabling Nassar's abuse. In 2021, the USOPC and USAG settled lawsuits brought by more than 500 athletes for $380 million.\nOrigins.\nSince 1990, USA Gymnastics has kept a list of people permanently banned from coaching for sexual abuse and other reasons. For example, the list includes Robert Dean Head, a USAG coach in Kentucky who in 1992 pled guilty to raping a 12-year-old, and Don Peters, the national coach for the 1984 Olympic team, who was banned in 2011 after two former gymnasts accused him of sexual abuse. In 2007, USAG began requiring background checks for coaches.\nYet USAG leaders also routinely dismissed warnings about coaches. For example, USAG received complaints about coach Mark Schiefelbein long before he was convicted in 2003 of molesting a 10-year-old girl. Similarly, USAG received complaints about coach James Bell at least five years before he was jailed in 2003 for molesting three young gymnasts. In a 2013 lawsuit, USAG officials admitted under oath that allegations of sexual abuse were routinely dismissed as hearsay unless they came directly from a victim or victim's parent.\nEven when USAG leaders believed the accusers, they sometimes allowed coaches to continue coaching for years. For example, USAG leaders waited four years before telling the police that they had received credible allegations of sexual assault by Marvin Sharp, who became a USAG coach in 2010. Sharp was charged in 2015 with three counts of child molestation and four counts of sexual misconduct with a minor; he died by suicide in prison.\nUSAG received at least four complaints against Georgia coach William McCabe, but did not report the allegations to the police. One gym owner had warned that McCabe \"should be locked in a cage before someone is raped\". McCabe continued coaching for seven years until one gymnast's mother went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with emails that he sent to her 11-year-old daughter. McCabe was charged with molesting gymnasts, secretly videotaping girls changing clothes, and posting their nude images on the Internet. He pleaded guilty and is serving a 30-year sentence.\nIn the years between 1996 and 2006, USAG received sexual abuse complaints filed against 54 coaches. The organization banned 37 of them from gymnastics, but allowed others—including some convicted of crimes—to continue coaching. One USAG regional chair spoke to the organization's president, arguing that a convicted sex offender should be allowed to keep his membership.\nIn a 2015 deposition in a lawsuit against USAG, USAG President Steve Penny said, \"To the best of my knowledge, there's no duty to report if you are—if you are a third-party to some allegation...You know, that lies with the person who has first-hand knowledge.\" Penny would resign under pressure in March 2017.\nAlso in 2015, USAG quietly fired its longtime Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar \"after learning of athlete concerns\". Nassar was a licensed osteopathic physician and the national team sports-medicine doctor for USAG. But Nassar continued to run a clinic and gymnastics club at MSU, where he was a faculty member.\n2016 revelations.\nDespite these and other occasional revelations about the sexual abuse of gymnasts, the general public was unaware of the scope of abuse and the efforts to cover it up until September 2016, when \"The Indianapolis Star\" began running a series of articles based on its eight-month investigation of the abuse. The investigation drew on interviews and more than 5,600 pages of court records from the McCabe case, released after the \"Star's\" Marisa Kwiatkowski requested the documents.\nIn September 2016, \"The Indianapolis Star\" reported that Rachael Denhollander was one of two former gymnasts who had made accusations of sexual abuse against Nassar. Following those criminal complaints, MSU reassigned Nassar from his clinical and teaching duties and fired him later that month. Since then, over 250 women and girls have accused Nassar of sexually abusing them; many of them were minors at the time of the crimes.\nAccording to those reports, Nassar committed sexual assaults during medical examinations and purported treatments. The molestations ranged from his inserting a finger into the gymnasts' vaginas and anuses to fondling their breasts and genitalia. These were criminal acts regardless of consent since the victims were minors. Nassar initially denied the charges, claiming that he was performing legitimate medical procedures. In February 2017, three former gymnasts—Jeanette Antolin, Jessica Howard, and Jamie Dantzscher—gave an interview with \"60 Minutes\" in which they accused Nassar of sexually abusing them. The gymnasts also alleged that the \"emotionally abusive environment\" at the national team training camps run by Béla and Márta Károlyi at the Karolyi Ranch near Huntsville, Texas, gave Nassar an opportunity to take advantage of the gymnasts and made them afraid to speak up about the abuse. Rachael Denhollander, one of the first women to publicly accuse Nassar, said in court in May 2017 that Nassar sexually abused her on five doctor's visits in 2000 when she was 15 years old.\nOlympic gold medalist McKayla Maroney, using the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter, stated that Nassar repeatedly molested her, starting in 2008 when she was 13 years old and continuing until she retired from the sport in 2016. Maroney filed a lawsuit against Nassar, MSU, the U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC), and USAG. The lawsuit accused USAG of covering up the sexual abuse by paying Maroney a $1.25-million settlement that required her to sign a non-disclosure agreement.\nDuring a \"60 Minutes\" interview, Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her when she was 15 years old. Gabby Douglas subsequently drew criticism from her Olympic teammate Simone Biles and others for sending a tweet (\"...dressing in a provocative/sexual way incites the wrong crowd...\") that they interpreted as criticizing Raisman and of \"victim-shaming\". Douglas later apologized for the tweet and said she was also a victim of Nassar's abuse.\nFormer national team member Maggie Nichols accused Nassar of abusing her and documented the ways he \"groomed\" her by connecting with her on Facebook and complimenting her appearance on numerous occasions. It was also reported that it was Nichols' coach, Sarah Jantzi, who first reported Nassar to USAG on June 17, 2015, after overhearing Nichols talk to other gymnasts, later revealed to be Raisman and Alyssa Baumann, about Nassar's behavior. Simone Biles came forward shortly after with firsthand accounts of how she too had been sexually abused by Nassar. Jordyn Wieber made a statement at Nassar's court sentencing in which she also accused Nassar of sexually abusing her during her time at USAG. On May 1, 2018, former national team member Sabrina Vega also accused Nassar of sexual abuse, claiming she was abused hundreds of times, beginning when she was 12. In August 2018, UCLA gymnasts and 2012 and 2016 Olympians Kyla Ross and Madison Kocian came forward as victims of Nassar. The following month, Alabama Crimson Tide gymnasts Bailie Key and Amanda Jetter also came forward with accusations against Nassar. In October, Tasha Schwikert, a member of the 2000 US Olympics team, came forward as a victim and claimed that Steve Penny pressed her to publicly support USAG at the height of the Nassar scandal. In November, Florida Gators gymnasts Kennedy Baker and Baumann made public allegations against Nassar; Baker said she was abused during the 2012 Olympic Trials.\nCriminal proceedings.\nLarry Nassar.\nIn November 2016, Nassar was charged with sexual assault of a child. Michigan attorney general Bill Schuette stated that the assaults began when the victim was 6 years old in 1998 and lasted until 2005. He pleaded not guilty to three charges of first-degree criminal sexual conduct against a minor during his first court appearance.\nThe following month, Nassar was indicted on federal child pornography charges. According to the FBI, over 37,000 images and videos of child pornography were seized from Nassar's home, including a GoPro video of Nassar allegedly molesting girls in a swimming pool. Some of the material was found on a hard drive and disks that Nassar discarded in his trash bin outside his home. Nassar pleaded guilty to three federal child pornography charges on July 11, 2017, and was given three consecutive 20-year prison sentences by U.S. District Judge Janet T. Neff on December 7, 2017.\nOn November 15, 2017, it was reported that Nassar pleaded guilty to counts of sexual assault in Ingham County (which contains most of East Lansing, the home city for Michigan State) and Eaton County in Michigan. At the time, he faced a total of 22 charges, 15 in Ingham and 7 in Eaton. Among the allegations was that under the guise of providing legitimate treatment, he molested 7 girls at his home and at a clinic on the MSU campus. It also stated that Nassar would enter a guilty plea in Ingham County on November 22 and would then plead guilty in Eaton County on November 29 and would serve at least 25 years in prison for these crimes. Others who reported assaults by Nassar to the police were permitted to make victim impact statements during his sentencing hearing.\nDuring his appearance before Judge Rosemarie Aquilina in Ingham County Circuit Court, and under the terms of his plea agreement, Nassar pleaded guilty to seven counts of criminal sexual conduct charges with a minimum sentence of 25 to 40 years in prison. Three of the victims were under the age of 13 and three ranged in age from 13 to 15. \nMore than 150 women made impact statements during Nassar's week-long sentencing hearing before the former doctor was sentenced on January 24, 2018, to state prison for 40 to 175 years. During his federal sentencing, Judge Neff had previously ordered that any state prison term run consecutive with Nassar's federal sentence. Judge Aquilina quoted a letter that Nassar had sent her before sentencing, in which he blamed his accusers. She described him as a dangerous individual who showed little remorse and said that she \"signed [his] death warrant\".\nDuring his Eaton County Circuit Court appearance, Nassar pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual misconduct with three children under the age of 16. On February 5, 2018, Judge Janet Cunningham sentenced Nassar to an additional 40 to 125 years in state prison. This sentence will run consecutive to Nassar's federal sentence but concurrent to his previous state sentence from Ingham County.\nIt was reported in January 2018 that one of Nassar's victims filed a police report to the Meridian Township Police Department in 2004 but the police decided to not press charges against Nassar because of a PowerPoint presentation he gave to them that claimed that he was doing legitimate medical treatment.\nSteve Penny.\nOn October 17, 2018, former USAG CEO Steve Penny was arrested on charges of evidence tampering in the Nassar case—specifically, of removing related documents from the Karolyi Ranch gymnastics training facility in Texas. On October 29, 2018, Penny entered a plea of not guilty. In April 2022, prosecutors dropped the charges against Penny.\nLou Anna Simon.\nOn November 20, 2018, former MSU president Lou Anna Simon was charged with two felonies and two misdemeanor counts for lying to the police. She was accused of falsely telling investigators she did not know the nature of a Title IX complaint against Nassar in 2014. Each felony charge carries a possible sentence of four years in prison.\nOn October 29, 2019, Eaton County District Court Judge Julie Reincke ruled there was sufficient evidence to bind Simon over for trial in Eaton County circuit court.\nOn May 13, 2020, Eaton County Judge John Maurer dismissed the charges against Simon. The Michigan Attorney General's Office said it planned to appeal.\nKathie Klages.\nIn August 2018, Kathie Klages, a former MSU gymnastics coach, was charged with one felony count and one misdemeanor count of lying to the police about her early knowledge of sexual abuse allegations against Nassar. Her trial began in February 2020. She was found guilty on two counts of lying to the police and faced up to four years in prison. Her sentencing was set for April 18, 2020, then rescheduled to July 15, then once again delayed by a water main break near the courthouse. On August 4, Klages was sentenced to 90 days in jail and 18 months of probation. On December 21, 2021, the Michigan Court of Appeals overturned Klages' conviction after determining that her false statement was \"inconsequential, rather than material\" to the criminal investigation of whether a MSU employee was complicit or not in allowing Nassar to prey on young athletes. Her case was dismissed in November 2022, legally clearing her after she served 90 days in jail and eight months of probation.\nJohn Geddert.\nOn February 25, 2021, John Geddert, the head coach of the 2012 US Women's Olympic Gymnastics Team, was charged with multiple felonies including 20 counts of human trafficking and forced labor, one count of first-degree sexual assault, one count of second-degree sexual assault, racketeering, and lying to a police officer. Geddert died by suicide shortly after his charges were announced.\nResponse and impact.\nUSAG and USOC.\nAs the \"Indianapolis Star\" was preparing to publish its 2016 investigation, the organization issued a statement: \"Nothing is more important to USA Gymnastics, the Board of Directors and CEO Steve Penny than protecting athletes, which requires sustained vigilance by everyone—coaches, athletes, parents, administrators and officials. We are saddened when any athlete has been harmed in the course of his or her gymnastics career\".\nThe USAG also said that it required criminal background checks for all of its coaches. The \"Star's\" investigation, however, found that \"some coaches are fired at gym after gym without being tracked or flagged by USA Gymnastics, or losing their membership with the organization\". It also found that top executives at USAG had routinely dismissed sexual abuse allegations against coaches and failed to alert authorities.\nAsked about Nassar in February 2017, USAG said that its executives first learned of an athlete's concern about him in June 2015. They said they conducted an internal investigation, and the following month fired Nassar and reported him to the FBI.\nMany criticized USAG's leaders for their handling of the allegations against Nassar, including U.S. senators who said the organization should have reported him to law enforcement more quickly. In March 2017, Juliet Macur of \"The New York Times\" criticized USAG executives for skipping the 2017 congressional hearing on protecting young athletes from sexual abuse, and noted that the organization had not apologized for its role in the scandal. In March 2017, USAG president Steve Penny resigned amid accusations of negligence and calls for his dismissal. Two-time Olympian Aly Raisman said the severance package given to Penny, reportedly $1 million, could have been used to help the affected athletes.\nIn June 2017, an investigator hired by USAG to review its policies and practices issued a report. USAG subsequently announced various changes, including a requirement that all USAG members report any suspected sexual misconduct to appropriate authorities and the US Center for SafeSport.\nBy year's end, the scandal had cost USAG several of its largest corporate sponsors, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kellogg's, Under Armour, The Hershey Company, and AT&amp;T. Procter &amp; Gamble was the name sponsor of the National Championships for five seasons, AT&amp;T had sponsored the American Cup since 2011, and Kellogg's sponsored a series of nationwide tours. Marketing revenues that year had accounted for about 35 percent of USAG annual revenues, or about $9.4 million.\nIn January 2018, USAG cut ties with several coaches and gyms that had employed Nassar. One was John Geddert, team coach of the 2012 London Olympic team and personal coach of Jordyn Wieber. Geddert operated two gyms that employed Nassar, including Twistars, one of the locations where gymnasts reported being abused by Nassar. Gymnasts had also accused Geddert of being abusive and dismissive of their injuries. One gymnast said Geddert had thrown her onto the low bar hard enough to tear the muscles in her stomach and end her career. They have said that Geddert's abuse left them vulnerable to Nassar's manipulation. Geddart retired soon after his suspension. That same month, USAG officially cut ties with Karolyi Ranch, the former national training center for the national team and a site where Nassar sexually assaulted many gymnasts. Within weeks, the Karolyi Ranch website announced that the facility had closed.\nOn January 22, 2018, three members of the USAG board of directors resigned.\nAfter Nassar's sentencing on January 24, 2018, the USOC published an open letter calling for the resignations of the other members of the USAG board, lest the USOC decertify the USAG. The USOC also announced that it was launching an investigation into the scandal. All remaining USAG board members resigned on January 31.\nTwo days later, the \"Wall Street Journal\" reported that USOC leaders, who had previously claimed that they had learned of abuse claims in 2016, had actually heard the allegations the previous year. The \"Journal\" reported that in July 2015, USOC Chief Executive Scott Blackmun had been told by Penny that an investigation uncovered possible criminal behavior by Nassar against Olympic athletes, and that two months later, Penny had detailed the allegations against Nassar to USOC's head of security. Blackmun resigned on February 28, 2018.\nOn February 2, Valeri Liukin resigned as national team coordinator.\nOn February 28, Raisman filed a lawsuit against USAG and the USOC, claiming both organizations \"knew or should have known\" about the ongoing abuse. On May 1, former national team member Sabrina Vega sued USAG, the USOC, and Béla and Márta Károlyi, claiming they ignored signs about Nassar's behavior or should have known he posed a risk to the gymnasts he treated.\nOn September 4, USAG CEO and President Kerry Perry resigned after USOC's new CEO Sarah Hirshland called for a change in USAG leadership and the US Elite Coaches Association called for a vote of no confidence in Perry. On October 12, Mary Bono was appointed USAG's interim president and CEO. Bono resigned four days later after many people, including Raisman and Biles, criticized her ties to her former law firm, Faegre Baker Daniels, which had helped cover up Nassar's crimes.\nOn November 5, 2018, the USOC announced that it was starting the process to decertify USAG as the national governing body for gymnastics in the United States. One month later, USAG filed for bankruptcy.\nOn January 30, the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Committee (USOC became USOPC in June 2019) proposed to settle all claims related to its coverup of sexual assaults by paying claimants a total of $215 million, about half of what Michigan State University had paid to settle similar lawsuits. The proposal would have barred future lawsuits prevent further investigation into the coverup. On February 29, 2020, gymnasts Biles and Raisman expressed anger over the proposal.\nOn December 13, 2021, it was reported that the USOPC, USAG, and Nassar's victims had reached a $380-million settlement. The number of victims abused by Nassar was confirmed to be more than 500. This was the first time that the USOPC admitted direct responsibility for the scandal. Its leaders agreed to share the costs and responsibility with USAG in order to help the gymnastics organization emerge from bankruptcy and preserve its certification atop U.S. gymnastics. While insurers of USAG and the USOPC would pay for most of the damages, the USOPC agreed to directly pay $34 million and lend $6 million to USAG so they could pay damages.\nMSU.\nMSU said that it first received a complaint against Nassar in 2014. A Title IX investigation into the complaint found no violation of policy and Nassar was allowed to continue treating patients under certain agreed-upon restrictions, as stipulated by MSU College of Osteopathic Medicine Dean William Strampel. However, no monitoring was instituted. After allegations against Nassar were reported by \"The Indianapolis Star\" in September 2016, Nassar was fired by Michigan State for violating the 2014 agreement.\nBy 2017, the university faced lawsuits from 144 local and MSU athletes who said they were sexually assaulted by Larry Nassar.\nMSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages was suspended on February 13, 2017, and retired the next day. According to court documents, Klages was reportedly aware of allegations against Nassar as early as 1997. She was accused of dismissing the complaints and pressuring gymnasts to stay silent about them.\nOn December 12, 2017, Strampel resigned as dean and went on medical leave as faculty. After mediation ended in the civil lawsuits, MSU's board of trustees voted to establish a $10-million fund to reimburse Nassar's victims for counseling services. MSU President Lou Anna Simon also apologized to the Nassar victims and donated her just-approved raise to the Roy J. and Lou Anna K. Simon Scholarship fund.\nDuring Nassar's sentencing in January 2018, eight former MSU athletes, including those from the gymnastics, softball, volleyball, rowing, and track and field programs, accused MSU staff of dismissing their sexual abuse complaints against Nassar.\nOn January 23, 2018, the National Collegiate Athletic Association opened an investigation into the university's handling of sexual abuse allegations against Nassar. On January 24, 2018, the Michigan House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly for a non-binding resolution sponsored by Rep. Adam Zemke that called for the university's Board of Trustees to fire President Lou Anna Simon if she did not resign. Simon resigned later that day. Two days later, MSU athletic director Mark Hollis retired.\nIn 2018, several other state and federal agencies investigated Michigan State's involvement, including the Michigan Attorney General's office and the US Department of Education.\nAs a result of the Michigan Attorney General's investigation, in March 2018, Strampel, who oversaw Nassar's clinic while dean of the College of Osteopathic Medicine, was arrested and charged with felony misconduct in office and criminal sexual conduct for allegedly groping a student and storing nude photos on his computer. Strampel also possessed a video of the pelvic floor manipulation procedure that Larry Nassar had created as a training video. The video may constitute evidence of an assault, and the investigation is continuing. On June 9, 2018, six current or former Michigan State employees linked to Nassar became the subjects of an investigation by Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs.\nOn May 16, 2018, MSU and Nassar's victims reached a $500-million settlement.\nOn September 5, 2019, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos announced that MSU would be fined $4.5 million for violating the Clery Act, which involves accurate disclosure and open access to crime statistics and crime prevention policies in colleges and universities that receive federal dollars, after two separate investigations from the Education Department's office of Federal Student Aid (FSA) and Office for Civil Rights (OCR). This was the largest Clery Act fine ever.\nCongress.\nCongress responded to the sexual abuse claims made against Nassar and also to claims made against personnel who were involved with USA Swimming and USA Taekwondo.\nOn March 28, 2017, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing about the bill. Former gymnasts Dominique Moceanu, Jamie Dantzscher, and Jessica Howard testified. Rick Adams, chief of Paralympic sports for the USOC and head of organizational development for the NGBs, said at the hearing, \"We do take responsibility, and we apologize to any young athlete who has ever faced abuse.\" USAG officials declined requests to testify at the hearing.\nLater that year, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators, including Sens. Dianne Feinstein, John Thune, and others, introduced a bill to require national governing body members overseeing Olympic sports to immediately report sexual assault allegations to law enforcement or to child-welfare agencies designated by the U.S. Department of Justice. The bill amended the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, under the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction, to expand the purposes of USOC to promote a safe environment in sports that is free from abuse. Dubbed the Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization Act of 2017, a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators Feinstein and John Thune and others, it was agreed to in the House of Representatives on January 29, 2018, in the Senate on January 30, 2018, and became law on February 14, 2018, when it was signed by President Donald J. Trump.\nAmong other things, the law directs the creation of a body to ensure that aspiring U.S. Olympic athletes can report allegations of abuse to an independent and non-conflicted entity for investigation and resolution, and to make sure that all national governing bodies follow the strictest standards for child abuse prevention and detection. The U.S. Center for SafeSport was duly created in 2017. It has exclusive jurisdiction over allegations of sexual misconduct and can impose sanctions up to lifetime banning of a person from involvement in all Olympic sports. It also collates a central database of disciplinary cases across all sporting disciplines.\nFBI failure to investigate and false statements.\nThe FBI failed to launch formal investigations into allegations that Nassar was abusing gymnasts; when asked about this, certain FBI officials lied and tried to cover up their failures, according to a report released in July 2021 by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ IG). As \"USA Today\" put it, \"For more than a year, complaints to the FBI went unanswered and Nassar continued treating—and raping—gymnasts at MSU, a high school in Michigan, and a gymnastics club in Michigan.\"\nIn 2015, USAG president Stephen Penny told local FBI agents in Indianapolis that three gymnasts said they were assaulted by Nassar. The FBI did not open a formal investigation or inform federal or state authorities in Michigan. In 2016, FBI agents in Los Angeles began a sexual tourism investigation against Nassar and interviewed several victims but also didn't alert Michigan authorities.\nBetween the time the FBI was told of Nassar's abuses and his arrest by MSU police in fall 2016, he abused more athletes—estimates range from at least 70, according to the DOJ IG report; and 120, according to Nassar's victims.\nThe report said that FBI agent William Jay Abbott had failed to act on the gymnasts' allegations, and later lied about doing so. The report further alleged that USAG's Penny had discussed finding Abbott a job at USA Gymnastics, while telling Abbott his concerns about the bad publicity that would be generated by the scandal.\nTwo months after the DOD IG report was released in July 2021, gymnasts Maroney, Biles, Nichols, and Raisman testified to the U.S. Senate that FBI agents had mishandled their allegations against Nassar, that the agents had lied about their reports, and that they had spread misinformation about the botched investigation. Maroney testified that she was met with silence by an FBI agent after telling the agent of Nassar's \"molestations in extreme detail\". She said that the FBI falsified her statement and that the agents involved should be indicted; she also criticized Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco for not appearing at the hearing. Raisman testified that the FBI made her feel her \"abuse didn't count\" and \"[I]t was like serving innocent children up to a pedophile on a silver platter.\" FBI Director Christopher Wray testified after the gymnasts, telling them that he was \"deeply and profoundly sorry that so many people let you down over and over again\".\nIn April and June 2022, 103 victims of Nassar sued the FBI for a total of $1.13 billion under the Federal Tort Claims Act for the FBI's false statements and inaction. In May 2022, the Department of Justice refused to arrest any FBI agent that was involved in the failure to investigate for 14 months.\nOther.\nThe victims received ESPN's Arthur Ashe Courage Award in 2018.\nMaggie Nichols, the first to have reported Nassar, received the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Inspiration Award for 2019."

Stewart does go JUCO and after all teams have defections due to major league signings, Mississippi State is ranked 6th. Perfect Game only covers commitments out of high school. There is also a JUCO player, Gunner Halter, SS, taken in the 26th round who plans to play for Mississippi State. There are also two high schoolers that were not drafted, probably due to difficulty of being signed, who were projected as top 10 rounders, Hayden Jones, C, and Christian McLeod, LHP.

They were named after the former Class-D Far West League affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies that played from 1948 to 1951. They previously played in the Golden State Collegiate Baseball League from 2016 to 2017 and were members of the Great West League, having joined that league in October 2017 and played during the 2018 season. They were without a league as the GWL suspended operations on October 4, 2018, and have eventually ceased operations themselves without notice. The owner Joe O'Connor was being given until December 31, 2018, to renew the lease or the team will be considered defunct. There was no response and the franchise was officially considered defunct.\nHistory.\nThe Gems were founded in 2011 by a group of local sports personalities including longtime Oregon Tech Owls men's basketball coach and athletic director Danny Miles, Howard Morris, Don Gresdel and Eric Baker. They named Chuck Heeman as the team's inaugural general manager. They were named for the original Klamath Falls Gems that played in the original Far West League from 1948 to 1951. \nBroadcasting.\nAll games, home and away, were broadcast live on KLAD-AM 960 &amp; FM 99.3 ESPN Radio and streamed live at the station's website."

        "text": "The 2017 FIA GT World Cup (formally the SJM Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup) was a non-championship Grand Touring (GT) sports car race held on the streets of the Macau autonomous territory on 19 November 2017. It was the event's third edition, and the tenth Macau GT3-specification cars race. The Automobile General Association Macau-China appointed the motorsports organiser Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) to form a grid for the race. The race itself consisted of an 11-lap qualifying race that set the starting order for the 18-lap main race.\nMercedes-AMG Team Driving Academy's Edoardo Mortara won the main race from pole position in a Mercedes-AMG GT3 after winning the Qualification Race the afternoon before. Mortara led from the start and every lap of the main race to achieved his sixth Macau victory. Second place was taken by the highest-placed rookie, Robin Frijns, driving an Audi R8 LMS for Audi Sport Team WRT. Maro Engel of Mercedes-AMG Team GruppeM Racing completed the podium in third.\nBackground and entry list.\nThe 2017 FIA GT World Cup was the event's third iteration and the eleventh time GT3 vehicles had raced in Macau. It was held on the 22-turn Guia Circuit on 19 November 2017 with three preceding days of practice and qualifying. Following the 2016 iteration, in which an accident involving Laurens Vanthoor curtailed the race and time constraints meant that all scheduled laps could not be completed, the FIA moved the first race of the 2017 Guia Race of Macau from Sunday morning to Saturday afternoon to increase the likelihood that the race would run for all 18 scheduled laps. Manufacturer-supported teams with professional drivers rated platinum or gold were permitted to compete as part of organiser Stéphane Ratel Organisation's goal of having a World Cup event for professionals and one for amateurs. Safety and trackside recovery procedures were enhanced. Following the 2016 race, some kerbs at turns one and two were modified for safety reasons, and TecPro energy absorption barriers were installed.\nDrivers had to have competed in a Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-regulated GT3-based championship race in the preceding two seasons or have substantial experience in Grand Touring (GT) cars to enter the FIA GT World Cup in Macau. Only drivers with a platinum or gold racing licence could compete, with silver-ranked drivers eligible on a case-by-case basis at the FIA GT World Cup Committee's discretion. Bronze-level competitors were not permitted to compete. Pirelli was the race's control tyre supplier and drivers were permitted to use five sets of slick tyres and three sets of wet-weather tyres.\nOn 24 October 2017, the entry list was made public. Twenty drivers from 13 nations raced, representing seven brands (Audi, BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Lamborghini, Mercedes-AMG, and Porsche). It featured defending winner Vanthoor, 2016–17 Formula E champion Lucas di Grassi, 2016 FIA World Endurance co-champion Romain Dumas, Blancpain GT Series champion Mirko Bortolotti, two-time Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters champion Marco Wittmann, and 2014 Bathurst 1000 co-winner Chaz Mostert.\nPractice and qualifying.\nThere was one 30-minute practice session each on Thursday morning and Friday morning preceding Sunday's race. In the first practice session, Maro Engel's 999 Mercedes-AMG Team GruppeM Racing car lapped fastest at 2 minutes, 18.948 seconds on his final lap. Raffaele Marciello's sister No. 888 car was second, Edoardo Mortara's No. 48 Mercedes-AMG Team Driving Academy third, the No. 63 Scuderia Corsa Ferrari 488 of Felix Rosenqvist fourth and Robin Frijns' No. 1 Audi Sport Team WRT R8 LMS fifth. Daniel Juncadella, Markus Pommer, Augusto Farfus, Nico Müller and Darryl O'Young filled positions six through ten. With ten minutes remaining, Di Grassi lost control of his car and collided with a barrier alongside the circuit in the track's mountain section, but he continued with minor damage.\nFrijns led the second practice session with a 2 minutes, 18.507 seconds lap, ahead of Audi brandmate Pommer in second. Farfus, Juncadella, Müller, Engel, Marciello, di Grassi, Bortolotti and Vanthoor completed the top ten drivers. Pommer spun through 360 degrees on the kerb on the inside of Mandarin Bend corner at more than . He narrowly avoided hitting the wall, and practice was not stopped. Fabian Plentz spun and caused the first stoppage, but he recovered and returned to the pit lane. When Hiroki Yoshimoto crashed his Porsche 911 at Solitude Esses turn and was in a dangerous position, a second red flag appeared.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session set the starting grid for the qualification race through each driver's fastest lap times. Mercedes-AMG took the first four places in fading light, with Mortara leading for most of qualifying to take his second consecutive pole position in Macau with a lap of 2 minutes, 17.565 seconds set in the final minutes. His teammate Juncadella joined him on the grid's front row and Team GruppeM Racing's Engel and Marciello were third and fourth. Müller was the quickest Audi driver in fifth. eight-thousands of a second behind Marciello. Tom Blomqvist's No. 99 Rowe Racing car qualified seventh, behind brandmate Farfus' No. 18 BMW Team Schnitzer M6 GT3 in sixth. Pommer, eighth, was the highest-placed silver ranked driver. Vanthoor's No. 911 Craft-Bamboo Racing car and di Grassi's No. 11 HCB-Rutronik Racing car were ninth and tenth. Rosenqvist was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten due to a car set-up error. Renger van der Zande's No. 84 Honda NSX was 12th, with Wittmann's No. 91 FIST Team AAI car in 13th. Bortolotti's Lamborghini Huracán GT3, Dumas and O'Young's Porsche, Frijns and Plentz's Audi, and Mostert's BMW were the last drivers to set a qualifying lap. Yoshimoto did not record a lap time because his team was unable to repair his car after a crash in the second practice session. Two drivers had incidents, but the session ended without the need for a stoppage. A malfunctioning anti-lock braking system caused Frijns to crash into the wall at Fisherman's Bend, but he slowly returned to the pit lane for repairs. Vanthoor crashed into the inside barrier at Fisherman's Bend turn at the end of the session. \nFollowing qualifying, the FIA altered the balance of performance in an attempt to achieve parity. The weight of the Mercedes-AMGs was increased from to and the weight of the Honda NSX was increased from to .\nQualifying race.\nThe qualifying race to determine the main race's grid order in overcast, dry weather began on November 18 at 12:25 p.m. Macau Standard Time (). Mortara fell behind Mercedes-AMG teammate Engel into Lisboa corner at the rolling start. Juncadella, another of Mortara's brandmates, attempted the same thing on the outside, but he knocked his steering arm out of alignment when he made contact with an outside barrier at Reservoir Bend turn. Juncadella's handling put him wide into an exit barrier as the field entered the right-hand Police Bend turn, considered one of the track's narrowest sections and a blind corner. Marciello narrowly avoided a collision with Juncadella, but Vanthoor was unsighted and understeered into Juncadella's stalled car's right-rear corner. A domino effect of accidents occurred behind Juncadella and prevented drivers behind him in the tightly-crowded field from being able to avoid the resulting road block. Di Grassi's car was suspended on Wittmann's bonnet, close to Pommer.\nNo driver was seriously injured in the collision, but the race was immediately stopped for more than an hour so that track marshals could clear the circuit, and cars were extricated using cranes on the right side of the circuit. The accident involved four uninvolved drivers, and four more damaged cars were deemed repairable and returned to the track. With 25 minutes remaining, the race resumed behind the safety car at 13:20 local time. Because his car failed to start in the pit lane due to a battery failure, Engel's brandmate Mortara led the restart. When racing resumed on lap three, Mortara quickly established a small lead over Farfus, who pressured him but was unable to overtake him. As a result, Mortara won the qualification race after 11 laps and started the main race from pole position. Farfus came in second 1.566 seconds later, and Marciello rounded out the podium in third. Frijns in fourth unsuccessfully pressured Maricello, and the final classified finishers were Mostert, O'Young, Yoshimoto, and Engel.\nMain race.\nThe race began at 12:10 p.m. local time on November 19 on a wet track in overcast weather. Many teams worked overnight to repair the structural damage done to their cars in the qualification race accident so that their drivers could compete in the main event. Blomqvist, Bortolotti, Pommer, Plentz, Rosenqvist, and Vanthoor's cars, however, could not be repaired by their respective teams in Macau due to extensive structural damage and were withdrawn from the race. Because of the damp track caused by an earlier rain shower, the race director decided to start behind the safety car, allowing drivers to adjust to the changing conditions. At the end of lap two, the safety car was withdrawn, allowing drivers to overtake. Mortara made a clean getaway from the rolling start but went slightly wide at Reservoir Bend corner and hit the outside wall leaving the corner. He was however untroubled as Farfus could not get close enough to challenge him. At Lisboa turn, Marciello rammed Farfus from behind, causing Farfus to lose third place to Marciello. Farfus slowed, hit an barrier and the car's boot cover lifted. \nEngel overtook Yoshimoto and O'Young to move into sixth on lap four. At the start of lap five, Marciello retired in the pit lane with smoke coming from the front of his car after sustaining radiator damage. The contact between Farfus and Marciello gave Mortara a six-second lead. On the sixth lap, track marshals waved a black flag with an orange disc to Farfus, instructing him to enter the pit lane and repair the loose car bodywork. The safety car was deployed on the same lap because di Grassi hit the barrier through the Solitude Esses at high speed. He then stopped his car in the mountain section. Farfus made his pit stop under the safety car to remove his boot cover and dropped to the back of the field. Three laps were spent behind the safety car and Mortara maintained the lead at the lap 10-restart. When Farfus made his pit stop, Engel moved to fourth before passing Mostert for third on the outside at Lisboa corner. O'Young crashed on cold tyres leaving the hill to the right-hand San Francisco Bend turn half a lap later. Müller hit him, sending O'Young spinning into a barrier.\nTo allow O'Young's car to be removed from the circuit, the safety car was deployed until the end of lap eleven. At the restart, Mortara maintained his lead, with Frijns second. Engel slipstreamed Frijns to remain with him. Mostert slid wide after exiting the Solitude Esses, allowing the recovering Farfus to overtake him for fourth. Engel spent the next few laps close by Frijns but the latter established a rhythm and began to draw closer to Mortara. However, Mortara led every lap achieved his sixth victory in Macau by 0.618 seconds over the closing Frijns who failed to overtake him. Engel finished third, Farfus fourth, and brandmates Mostert and Wittmann fifth and sixth. Dumas finished seventh, Juncadella eighth, and Yoshimoto was the final classified finisher. The attrition rate was moderate, with nine of the fourteen starters finishing the race, and the safety car was on track for six laps.\nPost-race.\nIn response to the sixteen car accident on the first lap of the qualification race, di Grassi called for a Global Positioning System (GPS) and accelerometer monitored automated warning system to caution drivers about an incident on the track. Drivers and fans of motor racing sharply criticised the proposal on social media because they perceived it as a system to slow the cars. Di Grassi said G-force sensors and accelerometers can determine whether a car has crashed, \"By GPS positioning you can say if the car is in front of you or behind you. If the car is in front of you, there is a light on the dash that glows yellow automatically, without anyone having to press a button with the same information. We don't have the same race director and marshals, especially in the base categories and amateur series. So we need a system that reacts fast. A system like that may have avoided a lot of crashes because first you don't need to look for the flag, if you’re following someone. It's much brighter if something is in front of you. And then it does not react as a human component.\""

        "text": "The 2020–23 ICC Men's Cricket World Cup Super League was the first edition of the ICC Cricket World Cup Super League, a One Day International (ODI) league. The league took place from July 2020 to May 2023, and served as part of the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process.\nThe league featured thirteen teams, the twelve Full Members of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Netherlands, who won the 2015–17 ICC World Cricket League Championship to qualify for this competition. Each team were scheduled to play an ODI series against eight of the other twelve teams, four series at home and four away. Each series consisted of three ODIs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic affected the start of the league, with several series of matches being postponed. In April 2020, following a Chief Executives' meeting, the ICC announced that it would look at the future of the league at a later date, once there is a better understanding of the impact of the pandemic on cricket. The series between England and Ireland, starting 30 July 2020, were the first matches of the league. In March 2022, as a result of the impact from the pandemic, the ICC agreed to extend the cut-off date for the tournament until May 2023, allowing the series between Ireland and Bangladesh to take place.\nTeams and qualification pathway.\nThirteen teams qualified:\nFor the World Cup, the hosts, and the top seven sides thereafter, were qualified automatically. The remaining five teams advanced to a qualifying event—the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier—along with five Associate sides, from which two sides went through to the World Cup.\nThe top twelve teams in this Super League remain in the Super League for the next World Cup cycle. The 13th ranked team in this Super League and the champions of the 2019–22 ICC Cricket World Cup League 2 took part in World Cup Qualifier, where the better team placed the 13th spot in the next Super League while the team ranked lower qualified in the next League 2.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was a partial round-robin league and played over two years. Each team were scheduled to play eight other opponents, four at home and four away, in series consisting of three ODI matches. This meant that a given team did not face all other opponents in their group, but all teams were scheduled to the same number of matches ( i.e., 12 matches at home and 12 matches away).\nPoints were awarded as follows:\nFollowing a trial that started in December 2019, the ICC announced the use of technology to monitor front-foot no-balls for all matches in the Super League. The third umpire called the front-foot no-balls, communicating with the on-field umpires.\nSchedule.\nThe match schedule was announced by the ICC on 20 June 2018 as part of the 2018–23 ICC Future Tours Programme.\nThe four teams that each side were not scheduled to face in the tournament was as follows:\nCOVID-19 pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic began before the start of the league, which was originally scheduled for May 2020 to March 2022, and resulted in no international cricket being played from March to July 2020. All Super League fixtures scheduled for 2020 were postponed or rescheduled with considerations for pandemic-related restrictions. Fixtures had to be reconsidered to account for the disruptions to the schedule.\nBangladesh's matches against Ireland were postponed on 21 March 2020. In April 2020, South Africa's tour to Sri Lanka was postponed. The same month, Pakistan's tour of the Netherlands and the West Indies tour of the Netherlands were both postponed, after the Dutch government banned all events in the country, both sports and cultural, until 1 September 2020. On 15 May 2020, Cricket Ireland confirmed that the tour by New Zealand had also been postponed. On 12 June 2020, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) confirmed that it had called off their tours to Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. On 30 June, Cricket Australia confirmed that their planned home series against Zimbabwe had also been postponed due to the virus. New Zealand's tour of the West Indies was postponed, after the fixtures clashed with the West Indies rescheduled tour to England. In August 2020, the Netherlands' tour of the Zimbabwe was cancelled due to the pandemic.\nThe first matches of the Super League were Ireland's 3-match ODI series in England which were originally scheduled for September 2020 but brought forward to July and August with all three matches taking place in Southampton. Australia's tour of England, which was originally to take place in July 2020, was postponed and took place in September 2020. England's tour of South Africa was postponed following an outbreak of COVID-19 among members of both teams and the hotel staff.\nIn December 2020, the ICC rescheduled the postponed series to a new schedule which would end in March 2023. A further, minor extension to May 2023 was announced in March 2022.\nLeague table.\nIn the event that one or more teams had the same number of points, the following tie-breaking procedure was used:\nFixtures.\n2020.\nEngland v Ireland.\nThis series was originally scheduled for September 2020 but was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nEngland v Australia.\nThis series was originally scheduled for July 2020 but was rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n2020–21.\nPakistan v Zimbabwe.\nThis series was originally scheduled to begin in November 2020.\nIndia v England.\nThis series was originally scheduled for September 2020.

It was the culmination of the 2023 Cricket World Cup qualification process and decided the final two participants for the 2023 Cricket World Cup.\nIn July 2020, Zimbabwe announced their intention to host the qualifier. They had hosted the previous qualification tournament in March 2018. In December 2020, Zimbabwe were confirmed as the tournament hosts.\nA fire occurred at the Harare Sports Club on 20 June 2023 behind the southwest grandstand, but no damage took place, and this did not affect the scheduling. The two finalists, Sri Lanka and the Netherlands, claimed the last two places at the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Sri Lanka won the tournament, beating the Netherlands by 128 runs in a one-sided final.\nTeams and qualification.\nThe tournament featured ten teams; the bottom five teams from the 2020–23 World Cup Super League, the top three teams from the 2019–23 Cricket World Cup League 2, and the top two teams from the 2023 Cricket World Cup Qualifier Play-off.\nAll matches in the qualifier tournament were One Day International (ODI) status. The International Cricket Council (ICC) confirmed that DRS would be used in the tournament, but only for matches in the Super Six stage and onwards. This was the first time the system was used in the Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament.\nImplications for future competition.\nThe top two sides from this qualifier will be awarded a spot in the 2023 Cricket World Cup. Originally, it was intended that the top-ranked team in the CWC League 2 (Scotland) could be promoted to the next Super League at the expense of the 13th ranked Super League team (Netherlands); but only if the League 2 winner finished as the higher of the two in this tournament. The team ranked lower would then have played in the next edition of League 2. However, in November 2021, the ICC announced that there would not be a second edition of the Super League.\nSquads.\nThe following squads were named ahead of the tournament:\nOn June 8, Gudakesh Motie was ruled out of the tournament due to a lower back injury and was replaced in West Indies' squad by Johnson Charles. Sri Lanka added Sahan Arachchige, Dilshan Madushanka and Dunith Wellalage as standby players to their squad during the group stage of the tournament. Before the Super Six stage of the tournament, Nyasha Mayavo was added to Zimbabwe's squad to replace the injured Clive Madande. Yannic Cariah was also ruled out of the tournament after the group stages, and Kevin Sinclair replaced in West Indies' squad. Dilshan Madushanka was later added to Sri Lanka's main squad after an injury ruled out Dushmantha Chameera. Lahiru Kumara too was ruled out of the remainder of the tournament during the Super Six stage, and Sahan Arachchige was added to Sri Lanka's main squad to replace him.\nWarm-up matches.\nTen non-ODI warm-up matches were played on 13 June and 15 June 2023.\nGroup stage.\nThe draw for the group stage was announced on 23 May 2023, with Group A was played in Harare and Group B in Bulawayo. The top three teams in each group advanced to the Super Six.\nGroup B.\nFixtures.\n---- \n---- \n \nSuper Six.\nTeams that advance to the Super Six played three further matches against the qualifiers from the other group, with the two results against teams from their own group carrying forward from the group stage. Teams also carried forward their seeding positions from the first stage to determine the fixtures for the Super Six.\nFixtures.\n \n \n \n \nTeam of the tournament.\nThe ICC named the following players in the team of the tournament:"

        "title": "2017 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2017 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 34th edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. The 13 races, all of which were Grade I, took place on November 3 and 4 at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California and were telecast by NBC and NBC Sports. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December.\nThe highlight of the event was Gun Runner's victory in the Classic, likely wrapping up Horse of the Year honors. Forever Unbridled, Roy H and World Approval likely wrapped up divisional Eclipse Awards with victories in the Distaff, Sprint and Mile respectively. The event featured many longshot winners, including Bar of Gold at 66–1, the second largest payout in the event's history.\nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge is a series of races that provide the winners of designated races with automatic \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Fifty pre-entrants in the 2017 Breeders' Cup qualified via the Challenge series, which was particularly important as seven of the Breeders' Cup races were oversubscribed. A maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Turf Sprint) are allowed to start in each race. Winners of the Challenge races are given automatic entries, while other pre-entries are ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nFive winners of Challenge series races went on to win their respective division at the Breeders' Cup:\nEvent preparation.\nThe Breeders' Cup organization announced in 2014 that Del Mar would host the event for the first time in 2017. Del Mar is best known for its prestigious summer meet, highlighted by the Pacific Classic. However, its seating capacity is notably lower than most other tracks at which the Breeders' Cup is run such as Santa Anita and Churchill Downs. As a result, Del Mar limited the attendance to 37,500 for both Friday and Saturday (compared to the 2016 figures of 45,000 on Friday and over 70,000 on Saturday at Santa Anita). Despite this, ticket revenues were higher than in 2016 because Del Mar designed many premium seating options.\nTo accommodate the event, Del Mar widened its turf course to be able to handle 14 horses. Because of the dimensions of track, the distances for two races were altered: the Turf Sprint was shortened to 5 furlongs (normally ) and the Filly &amp; Mare Turf was shortened to miles (normally ). Del Mar built temporary seating areas and upgraded the television monitors and video board. In response to unusually heavy fatalities during its 2016 summer meet, Del Mar revamped the main track to increase the banking on the turns and even out the surface. There were no life-threatening injuries during the 13 Breeders' Cup races.\nFor 2017, the Breeders' Cup announced that they would be performing out-of-competition testing on roughly 90% of horses (up from 40%-60%), including all North American Breeders' Cup Challenge race winners and at least one horse from each trainer. They also made a rule change that required horses who have been administered anabolic steroids for therapeutic purposes to miss six months of racing. The previous rule required a 60-day delay, with some state-to-state variation in how the rule was administered. This inconsistency had resulted in the disqualification of Masochistic from a second-place finish in the 2016 Sprint.\nOn October 25, the Breeders' Cup announced that 187 horses had been pre-entered for the event, including nine returning or former champions: Arrogate, Highland Reel, Drefong, Oscar Performance, Lady Eli, Champagne Room, Queen's Trust, Finest City, and Mongolian Saturday. The early entries included a record 46 horses from Europe, 14 of which were trained by Aidan O'Brien.\nResults.\nThe configuration of the Del Mar racetrack influenced many races and perhaps contributed to a rash of upsets – just one favorite won on each of Friday and Saturday. In particular, Del Mar has a relatively short homestretch compared to most other major racetracks, which made it difficult for horses to close from far back. According to handicapper Mike Watchmaker, the track had a strong bias towards horses racing on the outside. Only one horse won in front-running fashion: Gun Runner in the Classic.\nJavier Castellano earned the Shoemaker Award for outstanding jockey at the Breeders' Cup with one win aboard Rushing Fall, a second and a third. John Velazquez was the only jockey with multiple wins, taking the Distaff with Forever Unbridled and the Mile on World Approval. William Buick and Mickael Barzalona earned their first Breeders' Cup wins, both riding for Godolphin.\nLocal trainer Peter Miller earned his first Breeders' Cup victory with Stormy Liberal in the Turf Sprint, then earned his second just hours later with Roy H in the Sprint. Chad Brown also trained two Breeders' Cup winners, including Good Magic in the Juvenile.\nThe total betting handle over two days was $166.1 million, up 5.5% over 2016 at Santa Anita and up 6.8% compared to 2015 at Keeneland. Of this, $25,181,317 was bet at Del Mar itself, up sharply from $20,742,847 in 2016 despite the much lower attendance\nFriday, November 3.\nOn Friday, November 3, the first four Breeders' Cup races were run before a crowd of 32,278. The highlight of the day was Forever Unbridled's win in the Distaff, in which she defeated a strong contingent of three-year-old fillies led by Abel Tasman. The Juvenile Turf was won by Mendelssohn, a half-brother to champion Beholder who sold at auction for $3 million. Mendelssohn gave trainer Aidan O'Brien his 27th Grade I/Group One victory in 2017, adding to his world record. O'Brien advised that Mendelssohn would be considered for the 2018 Kentucky Derby.\nSource: Equibase Charts\nSaturday, November 4.\nThe highlight of the day was Gun Runner's commanding victory in the Breeders' Cup Classic, which likely wrapped up Horse of the Year honors. Gun Runner was the only horse to overcome an apparent track bias that favored horses racing from off the pace and on the outside. West Coast's third-place finish was likely good enough to earn him champion three-year-old honors combined with earlier wins in the Travers Stakes and Pennsylvania Derby.\nThe only favorite to win on Saturday was World Approval in the Mile, solidifying his bid for champion turf horse honors. In the Sprint, Roy H scored a mild upset and moved to the top of his division.\nIn the Juvenile, Good Magic became the first maiden to ever win a Breeders' Cup race. His clear victory, combined with a strong second-place performance in the Champagne Stakes, moved him to the top of the two-year-old colt division and made him the likely winter book favorite for the 2018 Kentucky Derby.\nThe day featured several wins by longshots, including Bar of Gold who won the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint by a nose at 66–1, the second largest payout in Breeders' Cup history. Stormy Liberal won by a head at odds of 30–1 in the Turf Sprint.\nSource: Equibase Charts"

He went to Saint Bonaventure's College in St. John's and later to Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. While in Halifax McGrath played with the Halifax Crescents of the Nova Scotia Senior Hockey League (NSSHL), between 1908 and 1911.\nFor the 1911–12 ice hockey season McGrath moved to New York City and found a place on the New York Wanderers in the American Amateur Hockey League. McGrath led the AAHL with 18 goals during the season but the Wanderers lost the championship title to the Brooklyn Crescents in a playoff game. McGrath was a diminutive player, standing only 5 feet and 2 inches, but he had a rough and tumble playing style and a hard shot that helped him score many goals.\nMcGrath was expelled from the AAHL after the 1911–12 season, after a hold-up dispute towards the St. Nicholas Skating Rink management, and did not play during the 1912–13 season, but he was reinstated by the league prior to the 1913–14 season and played for the New York Irish-Americans in 1913–14, 1914–15 and 1916–17, again leading the league in goals in 1913–14.\nWhile in New York City McGrath's proficiency as a stenographer led him to a private secretarial position with former President of the United States Theodore Roosevelt. He worked as a secretary and advisor for Roosevelt for five years, between 1912 and 1916, and he was with him on his presidential election campaign tour in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on October 14, 1912, when Roosevelt was shot in an assassination attempt by saloonkeeper John Flammang Schrank. In March of 1916 he was convicted of assault for a fight in which he and a cousin said they were defending a woman from a man whose leg was broken in the fracas however the conviction was later reversed.\nMcGrath later worked as a secretary for American politician and businessman George Walbridge Perkins, a friend of his former employer Theodore Roosevelt. Through Perkins he got involved in the fishing business and ran a fishing company in Boston.\nHe died in Newton Centre, Massachusetts, on February 18, 1924, 32 years old, after a brief period of illness. He was survived by his wife Florence Stenbeck and six children.\nStatistics.\n\"Statistics per Society for International Hockey Research at sihrhockey.org\""

        "title": "History of rugby union in the United States",
        "text": "The first recorded match between two colleges in game played in United States using rugby union code rules occurred on May 14, 1874 between Harvard University and McGill University. Predating rugby using the rugby union rules were rugby union style \"carrying games\" with use of hands permitted (as opposed to \"kicking games\" where hands were not permitted) including a game between Harvard College Freshmen and Sophomores at a game played at Harvard campus in 1858. Harvard varsity interscholastic rugby team was not founded until December 6, 1872 \nIn addition to Harvard rugby, Columbia Rugby, and Princeton Rugby, University of Pennsylvania and Yale College first fielded rugby teams in mid 1870s playing by rules much closer to the rugby union and association football code rules (relative to American football rules, as such American football rules had not yet been invented). An example of Penn's earliest games was a game against College of New Jersey (which in 1895 changed its name to Princeton) played in Philadelphia on Saturday, November 11, 1876, which was less than two weeks before Princeton met on November 23, 1876 with Harvard and Columbia to confirm that all their games would be played using the rugby union rules. Princeton and Penn played their November 1876 game per a combination of rugby (there were 20 players per side and players were able to touch the ball with their hands) and association football codes. The rugby union code influence was due, in part, to the fact that some of their students had been educated in English public schools and by 1869 Princeton was playing with rules substantially identical to rugby. \nAmong the prominent college players to play in a 19th century version of rugby (rules that did not allow forward passes or center snaps) was John Heisman, namesake of the Heisman Trophy and an 1892 graduate of the University of Pennsylvania Law School and Walter Camp of Yale. Heisman and Camp were instrumental in the first decade of the 20th century in changing the rules to more closely relate to present rules of American football.\nRugby grew in the early 1900s, spurred in part by American football's crisis of 1905–06 due to the perception that[American football was a violent sport. During this era, rugby was perceived as having the potential to challenge American football as the dominant football code on the west coast. For example, from 1906 to 1912 University of Pennsylvania (aka Penn) team played per rugby union code rules even after Penn started playing American gridiron football. Evidence of such may be found in an October 22, 1910, \"Daily Pennsylvanian\" article (quoted below) and a yearbook photo that rugby per rugby union code was played.\nLed by Cal and Stanford, a number of universities of the West Coast took a different path and did not play rugby union alongside American football BUT instead eliminated America football and changed their game to Rugby union. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911).\nAt the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, a United States rugby team (composed largely of players from the University of California and Stanford University) defeated France to win the gold medal. Rugby union was again included in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, where the United States defeated France for the gold. The player-coach of the United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby for Swarthmore College and also played while at Penn (as he was getting a Master's degree at Wharton School of Finance of University of Pennsylvania).\nDespite this success, however, rugby in the United States was surpassed by American gridiron football but Dartmouth, Penn, and Yale on East Coast played intermittently from the 30s through the 50s and University of California never stopped playing from the last decade of the 19th century through to the present.\nPrinceton and Harvard teams played using rugby union code continuously since the early 1930s (as detailed below). The present Princeton Rugby team was reorganized in 1931 under the leadership of Monte Barak, Hugh Sloan, H.F. Langenberg, and coach John Boardman Whitton and has been playing continuously ever since. Similarly Harvard Rugby has continuously played since the early 1930s. Indeed, over 5,000 people attended the inaugural Harvard - Princeton game in 1931.\nYale Rugby teams played using rugby union rules continuously since the late 1940s and Dartmouth Rugby teams continuously played per rugby union rules since it was reorganized in 1951.\nRugby union in the United States revival beyond University of California and Stanford University on West Coast and certain Universities (which became part of the Ivy League in the mid-1950s) accelerated in the 1960s and 1970s, as many colleges started club rugby teams. USA Rugby, the body that governs rugby in the U.S., was founded in 1975. On 31 January 1976, the U.S. national team played Australia—in its first official match since the 1924 Olympics—before 7,000 fans at Glover Field in Los Angeles. The United States national team participated in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup. Rugby in the U.S. received a significant boost in 2009 when the International Olympic Committee voted to reinstate rugby into the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016.\nProfessional competition of rugby union began in 2016, PRO Rugby, and the currently-sanctioned top-level professional league, Major League Rugby (MLR), began play in 2018. Major League Rugby implemented its first collegiate MLR Draft in 2020. Players are eligible for draft after 3 years in college at 21 years old. Free agents can try to join teams at 18 years old.\nCollege rugby is the fastest-growing college sport in the US. Rugby union is also the fastest growing-sport in the US.\nEarly football variants.\nEarly European settlers in North America brought forms of medieval and traditional football with them. However, we know that in 1610, William Strachey, an English colonist at Jamestown, Virginia recorded a game played by Native Americans, called \"Pahsaheman\", so it is clear that they had their own codes as well. Early games appear to have had much in common with the traditional \"mob football\" played in England. The games remained largely unorganized until the 19th century, when intramural games of football began to be played on college campuses. Each school played its own variety of football.\nPrinceton students played a game called \"ballown\" as early as 1820. A Harvard tradition known as \"Bloody Monday\" began in 1827, which consisted of a mass ballgame between the freshman and sophomore classes. Dartmouth played its own version called \"Old division football\", the rules of which were first published in 1871, though the game dates to at least the 1830s. All of these games, and others, shared certain commonalities. They remained largely \"mob\" style games, with huge numbers of players attempting to advance the ball into a goal area, often by any means necessary. Rules were simple and violence and injury were common. The violence of these mob-style games led to widespread protests and a decision to abandon them. Yale, under pressure from the city of New Haven, banned the play of all forms of football in 1860, while Harvard followed suit in 1861.\nEarly U.S. rugby history: 1800s.\nThe sport of rugby union in the United States has always had a close relationship with the sport of American football. Initially, games of rugby, soccer, and hybrid games had been played between American universities. Primitive forms of rugby, then all covered by the name \"football\", were being played in the US as far back as the 1840s, at Harvard, Yale and Princeton, stemming partly from Americans who had been educated in English schools. However, in 1862, Yale dealt it a major blow by banning it for being too violent and dangerous, about seven years later, in 1869, the first game of rugby football was played between Princeton and Rutgers. the rules of the Princeton–Rutgers game were a form of rugby that predates the adoption of rugby union code and did not allow forward passing. However, rugby union was taking a firm grip of a number of elite private academic schools (that would form the Ivy League in the mid 1950s), University of California and other East Coast and West Coast Universities, where it would have an influence on the nascent gridiron, which later became its major competitor. American football's growth came at exactly the point at which rugby was beginning to establish itself in the States.\nRugby spread through America's colleges, away from the Ivy League and the East Coast, into Texas, California and other west coast states. However, because of America's huge size, this resulted in a bipolar game, played mainly in east and west, but not really in the middle – other than Illinois and the Great Lakes, and Texas in the south. There would also come to be a small rugby-playing centre in Salt Lake City, as Polynesian Mormons came to study and live there, and to a lesser extent by returning missionaries.\nIn 1872, rugby clubs were established in the San Francisco Bay Area, composed mainly of British expatriates.\nIn 1875, Harvard athlete Nathaniel Curtis challenged Yale's captain, William Arnold to a rugby-style game. The two teams agreed to play under a set of rules called the \"Concessionary Rules\", which involved Harvard conceding something to Yale's soccer and Yale conceding a great deal to Harvard's rugby. The game featured a round ball instead of a rugby-style oblong ball, and caused Yale to drop association football in favor of rugby.\nIn 1876, Yale, Harvard, Princeton, and Columbia formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, a competition based on the traditional rules of rugby union. Around the same time, the aforementioned British rugby players of San Francisco introduced rugby to the University of California, Berkeley.\nA persistent problem within rugby football would be the question of amateurism vs professionalism. American football would take the professional route, something much frowned upon by the leadership of the rugby fraternity at the time. This was leading to crises in the Old World too, where in 1895, the Northern Rugby Football Union (a rugby league body) split away in England. While rugby league failed to gain much headway in North America, the financial draw of professional American football proved too strong for some American rugby players. Rugby union would not become professional officially until the 1995.\nRugby and American football.\nRugby has had a long and complicated relationship with American football, which was based upon American variants of rugby football and association football. Another important point is that during the 19th century, the United States was trying to develop a new national culture, independent of its English colonial roots, as it had become politically independent the previous century. This extended into the sporting arena, with the adoption and invention of American football, basketball, and volleyball, and also the myth of Abner Doubleday founding baseball, which attempted to divorce it from its English origins.\nUnlike football, rugby has established itself through the United States via its colleges and universities.\nBy the end of the 19th century, rugby's American offspring had outgrown its parent within America, and many young Americans who would have made good rugby players were steered into American football instead.\nNonetheless, some of rugby's legacy can be seen in American football to this day, including its prolate spheroid football, rucking, and elevated goalposts of similar width. Major differences include higher tackles than rugby, protective equipment, and forward passing. The fair catch kick is a relic of the now obsolete goal from mark. The scoring systems have evolved in parallel, with both rugby union and American football offering three points for a kicked goal and seven points for a ball run into the end zone and a successfully kicked conversion.\nEarly 1900s.\nOne factor aiding in rugby's growth in the early 1900s was American football's crisis of 1905–06, with President Teddy Roosevelt engaging in a debate about the future of American football in response to the perception that American football was a violent sport.\nThe growth of rugby in the United States and particularly in California was aided by the 1905 New Zealand national team, known as \"The Originals\", playing three matches in the U.S. in early 1906 —one exhibition match in New York, and two exhibition matches in California against teams from British Columbia. Apart from the high standard of rugby in various parts of Canada, it was not uncommon for Australian and New Zealand sides to play games in the US – especially California and New York – when returning from Europe, or when European teams made the trip the other way.\nSome west coast colleges—including the flagship University of California, Stanford University, and Santa Clara—abandoned their American football programs in favor of rugby. The \"Big Game\" American football rivalry between Cal and Stanford was played as a rugby match instead of American football from 1906 to 1914 (1906 was notable for being the first year that American football had legalized the forward pass, a system that would become a distinguishing characteristic in the American game that is not present in rugby).\nRugby union grew on the West Coast, and as many as 26,000 spectators regularly attended matches between the University of California and Stanford University. During this era, rugby was perceived as having the potential to challenge American football as the dominant football code on the west coast.\nThe unfamiliar and complex game play hampered rugby's initial growth on the East Coast. Controversy arose in 1905 when published photographs of a rugby match between Swarthmore College and the University of Pennsylvania were used to depict rugby as a \"harsh game\".\nIn 1908 and 1909, the Australian national team visited the U.S. as part of an international tour, playing university teams and an all-California side.\nIn 1910, a combined Universities rugby team comprising mostly players from Cal, Stanford, and the University of Nevada went on a tour of Australia and New Zealand. The underdog American side upset both Rotorua RFC and Auckland RU, which came as a great surprise to the international rugby community. In 1910, D.W. Wheeler of the University of California wrote that \"rugby throughout the state is on the boom,\" with five out of six San Francisco high schools having taken up rugby.\nIn 1912, the Australian national team returned to America; this tour was the first and only America-specific tour by Australia to date. Stanford University defeated the Australian national team 13–12 on 16 October 1912, with the San Francisco Examiner declaring that the win had \"raised America to a position among the first-class rugby nations.\" Australia's 1912 tour of the United States saw the United States national team play their first international test against Australia. The United States performed well, holding a lead in the second half, before losing 12–8. The San Francisco Chronicle declared that \"America has arrived on the international map\" and predicted that the U.S. \"will be looking down upon all the other nations in a few more years.\"\nAfter a promising start on the international stage, the Americans were thrashed 51–3 a year later by a strong All Blacks side in their tour on North America. This test was organized by former Cal president Benjamin Ide Wheeler in an attempt to popularize rugby among his students.\nBy 1915, rugby in California was already beginning to decline. The University of California returned to American football in 1915–1916. Once the University of California returned to American football, a number of local schools quickly followed.\nThe vastness of the US has resulted in the rise of regional \"Conferences\", where the East and West played as different blocs. Hawaii and Alaska led completely separate rugby existences, focusing their energy on their South Seas, and British Columbian neighbors instead. Until recently this vastness also caused problems in the preparation of a national team, as the players would rarely get to meet one another.\nOlympics gold: 1920 &amp; 1924.\nThe U.S. national team won their first test in 1919, defeating Romania.\nRugby union was a fixture at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, and a United States team composed largely of players from Stanford University and coached by Dan Carroll defeated France to win the gold medal, after money was raised in San Francisco to send them to Europe.\nIn 1924, rugby union was again included in the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. An American side was invited to participate, and the team surprised spectators by landing a place in the final with the hosts – the French. An estimated 50,000 turned up to Colombes Stadium to watch. The United States defeated France for the gold in 1924. The player-coach of United States Olympic gold-winning rugby team at the 1924 Summer Olympics was Alan Valentine, who played rugby for Swarthmore College and while at University of Pennsylvania as he was getting a Master's degree at Wharton School of Finance.\nThis was, however, the last time until 2016 when rugby featured at the Olympics, and the last ever for the full 15-man version of the game (the return of rugby in 2016 was in the sevens version). As a result, the 1924 United States team is the last to win gold in the full version of rugby union. Rare vintage footage of the 1924 Gold Medal match was included in the rugby documentary, \"A Giant Awakens: the Rise of American Rugby\".\n1930s–1950s: Attempted introduction of rugby league.\nIn the mid twentieth-century, rugby union continued to be a purely amateur sport, unlike American football and the breakaway rugby league. Rugby league didn't make much headway in the US, for the simple reason that many rugby players who wished to go professional could go into the NFL instead, where there was better pay. The expansion of rugby league was frequently at the expense of rugby union elsewhere.\nAn early attempt to introduce rugby league was in 1939, when the Californian Rugby Football Union wrote to the governing body of rugby league, the Rugby Football League, to tell them they wanted to switch from rugby union and affiliate to the RFL. The timing was unfortunate, and the RFL was unable to send out a delegation due to the outbreak of World War II in Europe. California was one of the historic heartlands of rugby union in the US.\nHowever, during the war itself, American servicemen stationed abroad occasionally played matches against teams from other allied sides – these included those from the British, Australian and South African militaries.\nAnother postwar attempt to introduce rugby league to the US took place in 1953, when wrestling promoter Mike Dimitro was asked to organize a tour of Australasia by an American rugby league team. However, this failed to generate much interest, and none of the team had ever played rugby league before the tour. Dimitrio did persist though, by holding exhibition games by the Australian and New Zealand rugby league teams, again in California. Dimitrio later tried to get a rugby league world cup in the US, but this also failed, and the rugby played in the US remained mainly of the union variety.\nIt was not until the late 1970s that any more serious attempts were made to introduce rugby league.\nModern history: 1960s–present.\nRugby began its revival in the United States in the late 1950s and into the 1960s and 1970s, as many colleges started club rugby teams. Rugby began getting some coverage in the media, including in the New York Times, when 1958 Heisman Trophy winner Pete Dawkins played for Oxford against Cambridge in 1959. The first rugby sevens tournament in the U.S. was played during Thanksgiving weekend in 1959 in New York with eight teams from various northeast colleges.\nUSA Rugby, the body that governs rugby in the U.S., was founded in 1975. On 31 January 1976, the U.S. national team played Australia—in its first official match since the 1924 Olympics—before 7,000 fans at Glover Field in Los Angeles. \nIn 1980, USA Rugby formed a college national championship tournament. In 1987, the U.S. national team participated in the inaugural Rugby World Cup. The U.S. women's national team was officially formed in 1987. \nThe Rugby Super League, a nationwide club competition, was played from 1996 to 2012. From 2003 to 2011, the U.S. national team played in the Churchill Cup, with the U.S. hosting matches from 2006 to 2010. The U.S. men's national rugby sevens team has participated in the World Rugby Sevens Series each year since the tournament's founding in 1999, and the women's national sevens team has participated in the World Rugby Women's Sevens Series since the competition's launch in 2012. Rugby in the U.S. received a significant boost in 2009 when the International Olympic Committee voted to reinstate rugby into the Summer Olympics beginning in 2016. In 2014, the United States hosted the New Zealand national team before a record sellout crowd of 60,000+ at Soldier Field in Chicago, a match later billed as potentially marking the rise of American rugby. In 2016, PRO Rugby established the first fully professional Rugby competition in the U.S. Also in that year, the English top-flight club London Irish took a home match against Saracens to the Red Bull Arena in the New York area, marking the first top-flight English match ever held outside that country.\nProfessionalization.\nDuring the 1990s, rugby union became officially professional on a global level. In early November 2015, a new professional rugby organization, named PRO Rugby, launched its Facebook page and scheduled an announcement for November 9, 2015. On November 9, 2015, PRO Rugby made an official announcement outlining its plans and a framework for the competition. USA Rugby affirmed that it sanctioned and supported the PRO Rugby competition. Despite a 2016 PRO Rugby season being held, issues occurred during the offseason, and a second season never occurred.\nPRO Rugby folded the San Francisco Rush in December 2016, citing a lack of a suitable venue, and on lack of support from the local media. All PRO Rugby players then received notice on December 20, 2016, that their contracts would be terminated in 30 days if progress was not made towards resolving disputes between the league and USA Rugby. As of 2018, numerous players still report to have not been paid the salaries specified in their contracts with PRO Rugby. To recover some of their lost income, some players have elected to file claims with their local labor commissioner offices. No other official announcements were made. By the end of 2017, no representative for PRO Rugby had shown up in any of the court cases in regards to the expenses owed to former director Lewis and others from the operation on the lone Pro Rugby season.\nMeanwhile, organization of what would become Major League Rugby began in September 2016. At least five amateur rugby union clubs across the United States began discussing a possible professional league, as Dean Howes, who had previously been an executive with Major League Soccer's Real Salt Lake and the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League, stepped in as senior strategic advisor for Rugby Utah in an attempt to provide a pathway for expanding professional rugby stateside.\nWith PRO Rugby on its way to folding, by February 2017, a total of nine amateur rugby union organizations including the Austin Huns, Dallas Griffins, Glendale Raptors, Houston Strikers, Kansas City Blues, Minneapolis, New Orleans RFC, Rugby Utah and the Seattle Saracens, had announced their intentions to form a professional league to begin play the following year.\nOn November 6, 2017, Major League Rugby and CBS Sports Network announced a multi-year television partnership which marked MLR's first major television deal for broadcast rights. It was the first time in American history that a new sporting league had a national television deal prior to launch.\nThe first regular season game in Major League Rugby history was held on April 21, 2018, when the Houston SaberCats hosted the New Orleans Gold in Houston. The Toronto Arrows joined the league ahead of 2019 season as the first Canadian team in MLR. Three further American clubs began play in 2020."

        "text": "The South Africa Baseball Union \"SABU\" is the national governing body of baseball in South Africa. Baseball is played in all provinces, but it is not a major sport especially due to the popularity and relative success of the comparable sport of cricket, in which South Africa is one of the leading countries playing the sport.\nThe Union is a member of the World Baseball Softball Confederation (WBSC), and the International Baseball Federation (IBAF). SABU is also an affiliate of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), which, alongside Sport and Recreation South Africa (SRSA) supervises all organised sport in South Africa.\nSABU controls the South African national baseball team, which has participated in several major events such as the Summer Olympics, World Baseball Classic, Baseball World Cup and the African Games.\nThe most notable South African born baseball players include Gift Ngoepe, Anthony Phillips and Dylan Unsworth\nHistory.\nBaseball in South Africa began in the Witwatersrand. Gold miners from the United States started playing the game in South Africa leading to the establishment of Giants Baseball Club from the Crown Mines baseball team. Transvaal Baseball Association was established in 1905 with one of the early clubs being the Wanderers Baseball Club.\nJapanese influence led to the beginning of the sport in Port Elizabeth, after a Japanese ship named the Paris Maru, was marooned in Algoa Bay in 1934, leading to its sailors being stranded for 3 months waiting for the next ship. The sailors consequently organized a game with the locals, who worked for US companies, as well as US missionaries at the Westborne Oval ultimately leading to the establishment of the Eastern Province Baseball Association in 1934.\nDuring World War II, baseball was not played officially, but continued after the war in 1945. One of the first matches involved a US team selected from two visiting US naval warships, USS California and USS Tennessee, with the Americans winning 6–4.\nThe 1950s marked the golden era for baseball in South Africa, with popular support from both players and locally based American-owned businesses e.g. General Motors. A US side embarked on a South African tour in 1956. Many popular South African international Springbok rugby players displayed strong support for local baseball.\nIn 1935, the South African Baseball Federation (now South African Baseball Union) was established with its provincial affiliates being; Border, Western Province, Eastern Province, Northern Transvaal and Transvaal. Arthur Berezowski led the Federation for 25 years - 1949 to 1974. 1950 witnessed the rise of Western Province Baseball and Softball Union, comprising 11 baseball and 23 softball teams."

        "text": "The AFC/CAF–UEFA qualification play-off for the 1958 FIFA World Cup was a two-legged home-and-away association football match between the winners of the African/Asian region, Israel, and a randomly drawn group runner-up from Europe, Wales. The matches were played on 15 January and 5 February 1958 in Ramat Gan and Cardiff, respectively.\nWales had finished second in their qualifying group to Czechoslovakia. Israel had advanced from the AFC/CAF qualification zone without playing a match after several teams withdrew from the competition for political reasons. FIFA introduced a rule that a team could not qualify for a World Cup without playing and organised a play-off match to decide on qualification. Wales were drawn as the opponents and the two sides met in Ramat Gan for the first leg. Wales won the first match 2–0, following goals from Ivor Allchurch and Dave Bowen. The second leg ended with the same result with Allchurch scoring again and Cliff Jones adding a second. \nWith Wales qualifying, this remains the only time that a country played at the World Cup finals after having been eliminated in the regular qualifiers. This also remains the only time that all four British Home Nations qualified for the World Cup finals. Wales went on to reach the quarter-finals at the 1958 World Cup, before being eliminated by Brazil.\nBackground.\nWales were drawn into group 4 of the European qualifying zone for the 1958 FIFA World Cup, where they faced Czechoslovakia and East Germany. Wales manager Jimmy Murphy was leading the side in World Cup qualifying for the first time and his side won their first match after defeating Czechoslovakia 1–0 in Cardiff following a goal from Roy Vernon, despite missing several players due to injury and withdrawals. Wales travelled to East Germany for their next fixture, but chose to take only twelve players, eleven starters and one substitute, to save money. One of the players, Derek Tapscott, was ruled out of the tie with injury shortly beforehand and John Charles arrived late due to club commitments. The match was East Germany's first competitive fixture in the nation's history and they claimed a 2–1 victory in a match attended by around 110,000. \nWales continued to Czechoslovakia for their next match six days later. The squad had only ten fit players following the match against East Germany and an outcry from the Welsh media prompted Ray Daniel and Des Palmer to be called up as replacements. During the game, Daniel inadvertently gave the opposition the lead after scoring an own goal following a corner kick. The Czechs added a second goal after an hour to secure a 2–0 victory. Wales' hopes of qualification were ended when Czechoslovakia recorded consecutive victories over East Germany. In their final group game, Wales defeated East Germany 4–1 following a hat-trick from Palmer and an own goal from the opposition goalkeeper. As a result, Wales finished second in the group behind Czechoslovakia, and were therefore eliminated from the European qualification zone.\nFor the qualifying stages of the 1958 FIFA World Cup, Israel were regarded as an Asian team and took part in the African and Asian qualification zone. A total of 11 teams were competing for one direct qualification spot to the 1958 FIFA World Cup finals. Israel were drawn into group 2 of the first round against Turkey. However, their opponents refused to compete in the Asian group, claiming that they should be included in the European qualifying section. The world football governing body, FIFA, subsequently allowed Israel to advance to the second round automatically where they were drawn against Indonesia. However, with ongoing political upheavel in Indonesia, the nation applied to FIFA to play against Israel on neutral ground. Their approach was rejected and Indonesia subsequently withdrew, allowing Israel to advance to the final round.\nIsrael were paired with Sudan in the last round, with the winner advancing to the World Cup. Sudan had also advanced from the previous round without playing a fixture after Egypt had withdrawn due to Israel's presence owing to tensions between the two nations following the Suez Crisis. Sudan refused to play against Israel for political reasons, so Israel were therefore named the African and Asian qualification zone winners without playing a match. This would have granted Israel qualification to the World Cup, but FIFA decided to introduce a rule that no team would qualify without playing at least one match, except for the defending champions and the hosts. This was because many teams had qualified for previous World Cups without playing due to withdrawals of their opponents. As Israel had advanced automatically through all three rounds under these circumstances, they still had to face another team before they could qualify. Therefore, a play-off match was created by FIFA between Israel and the runner-up of a group from one of the other qualifying regions, UEFA, CONMEBOL and NAFC/CCCF, where the teams would play against each other on a home-and-away basis. The winner of this play-off would then directly qualify for the 1958 World Cup in Sweden. Therefore, effectively, only 0.5 places were granted to Africa and Asia for the finals.\nA drawing of lots took place in December 1957 to determine which team would face Israel in the play-offs. Ahead of the draw, Uruguay withdrew, while Italy and Northern Ireland had not finished their qualification group, leaving nine teams in the draw. Belgium were selected first but rejected the opportunity so the draw was made again and Wales were selected and would therefore take part in the play-off against Israel. Therefore, the play-off winners would make their World Cup finals debut, as both Israel and Wales had never previously qualified.\nMatches.\nFirst leg.\nSummary.\nWales travelled to Israel with little support, although 90 Welsh servicemen did secure a flight from a military base in Cyprus to attend the match. An error in preparation meant the side arrived in Israel without a ball. As a result, the team were limited to physical training beforehand. Wales were heavy favourites ahead of the tie with their only other weakness believed to be the heat, with temperatures expected to be around . Murphy banned his players from using the hotel pool during their stay.\nThe match was attended by around 55,000 spectators, including the British ambassador to Israel. Wales had an early goal ruled out after Ivor Allchurch was caught offside before he found the net again after 38 minutes to open the scoring. After receiving a pass from Terry Medwin, Allchurch found space on the edge of the penalty area and scored from out. Allchurch continued to cause problems for the opposition defence, shooting wide after collecting a Stuart Williams free-kick and drawing a save from Israeli goalkeeper Ya'akov Hodorov.\nWales eventually scored a second through Dave Bowen midway through the second half, also from 20 yards out. Wales received a blow late in the game when John Charles went down injured. He returned to the field to finish the game but struggled for the final minutes of the game. The victory was the first time Wales had won a match outside the United Kingdom.\nSecond leg.\nSummary.\nWales remained heavy favourites to advance following the first leg. They made minor changes to the side, Medwin and John Charles switched positions to allow the latter to play centre-forward. The only other change saw Ron Hewitt make his international debut in place of Len Allchurch. Israel made one change to their starting eleven from the first leg, Boshos Gegosian replaced Zebaria Tetzabi. Yosef Goldstein had been a doubt with an ankle injury but recovered to play.\nAlready trailing by two goals from the first leg, Israel struggled to impose themselves on the second leg as Wales again dominated the tie. Israeli goalkeeper Hodorov won plaudits for his performance in the match, making several saves to deny Wales a goal. His efforts also included using his body to stop advancing players; one collision with an opposition player left him with a broken nose and concussion but he continued playing. Israel adopted a more physical style of play in the second leg and were cited by the referee on several occasions for \"frequent use ... of the late tackle, of body checking and other obstructionist methods.\" Charles, who had recovered from his injury in the first leg, was the main target of these methods and they proved effective as he struggled to gain a foothold in the game. The impetus of the Welsh attack was instead provided by Cliff Jones and Medwin.\nIsrael struggled to create many attacking opportunities, their best chance of the game fell to Yehoshua Glazer who was denied by Wales goalkeeper Jack Kelsey, who saved with his knee. Wales were frustrated in front of goal for much of the match despite the Israeli defence being \"beset by wave after wave of red shirts\". Wales scored their first goal after 76 minutes through Allchurch who held off several tackles before shooting into the roof of the net from a narrow angle. Mewdin's forward play continued to excel and he created the second goal after breaking into the Israeli penalty area before pulling the ball back across the box. Charles missed the first attempt but the ball fell to Jones who added a second for Wales.\nAftermath.\nAs of March 2023, Wales' victory remains the only time a team have qualified for a World Cup having been eliminated from the normal qualifying process. It also remains the only time that all four Home Nations have qualified for a World Cup. Despite the clear margin of victory, newspaper reports after the game were scathing of Wales' performance with \"The Times\" remarking that Wales would \"do little more than make the journey to Scandinavia\". At the World Cup, Wales advanced from their group after winning a play-off match against Hungary. In the quarter-finals, they were eliminated by Brazil after losing 1–0.\nMurphy's attendance at the second leg meant he was forced to miss a match in his other role as assistant manager to Matt Busby at Manchester United. The following night, United played Red Star Belgrade in the European Cup and were travelling back to Manchester via Munich when the team's airplane crashed on the runway at Munich-Riem Airport, resulting in the Munich air disaster which caused 23 fatalities.\nIsrael would eventually qualify for their first and only World Cup in 1970, where they were eliminated in the group stage. \nReferences.\nBibliography \n "

        "title": "Arthur Golf",
        "text": "Arthur Golf (21 July 1877 – 18 February 1941) was a German academic agronomist. A principal focus of his teaching and research was on \"colonial agriculture\": another was \"selective breeding\", concentrating on sheep. During his later years he was a professor at Leipzig University where between 1933 and 1935, and again during 1936/37, he served as University Rector.\nLife.\nRichard Arthur Golf was born into a Protestant family in Beyersdorf, a rural settlement in the marshy flatlands to the north-east of Halle. His father, Richard Golf, was a \"gentleman farmer\" (\"Rittergutsbesitzer\"): several of his remoter ancestors were also landowner-farmers. He successfully concluded his schooling at the at Halle in 1896 and went on to work as an agricultural apprentice on at least two working estates in Saxony. During 1897/98 he undertook his military service as a volunteer in an artillery regiment in Breslau (as Wrocław was known at that time). He went on to study agriculture at Breslau and Halle, and then, from 1901, at the Agriculture Academy in Bonn-Poppelsdorf (\"Institut für Bodenlehre und Pflanzenbau an der Landwirtschaftsakademie Bonn-Poppeldorf\"). In 1901 he obtained his teaching certificate in agriculture.\nGolf was much influenced by , a pioneer in the development of \"colonial agronomy\" as an academic subject. He became an assistant to Wohltmann at the academy in Bonn-Poppeldorf during 1901. During 1902 he participated in a five-month research trip to North America, the purpose of which was to investigate the irrigation-based agriculture there. The North America trip provided the material for his dissertation, and in 1903 he received his doctorate from Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg for a piece of work on the natural underpinnings of the American irrigation-based economy. After that he worked as an assistant to at the Physiology Laboratory of the Agronomy Institute at Halle. It was also at Halle that Golf received his habilitation (higher academic degree), in 1907, in a piece of work which appears to have built further on the work undertaken on agricultural irrigation in North America.\nThat same year he was commissioned by the Imperial Colonial Office to undertake an expedition to South and Southwest Africa. This was followed by similar trips to East Africa, Central Asia and Scandinavia (and other places). The core objective was to research the relationship between water management and arable agriculture. One result of these expeditions, which appeared in 1911, was a book on Arable Agronomy in German South West Africa, which dealt with \"Trockenfarmen\" (\"farming in dry conditions\"). After that, in 1912, he was appointed to a permanent extraordinary professorship at Leipzig with a teaching contract that covered colonial and foreign/tropical agronomy.\nWar broke out at the end of July 1914 which interrupted Golf's academic career. He served on the frontline as a cavalry officer (\"Rittmeister\"). Just over four years later war ended in defeat for Germany and he returned to civilian life. Like many demobilized officers, Golf strongly opposed the new republican government which was associated with the shame of military defeat and the enforced abdication of The Kaiser. One aspect of the imposed Peace of Versailles that directly affected Golf was the confiscation of German South West Africa and Germany's other colonies outside Europe. \"Colonial Agriculture\" was no longer an academic discipline with a bright future. Obliged to find himself a supplementary academic speciality, he built up an expertise in selective breeding.\nIn 1922 Golf was appointed to a full professorship of animal husbandry (\"Tierzucht\") at Leipzig University in the \"Mathematics and Natural Sciences\" department of the Faculty of Philosophy, taking on the position that had fallen vacant through the death, the previous summer, of . The post was one which Golf would retain till his death in 1941. He headed up, as responsible professor, the \"Institute of Animal Husbandry and Dairying\" (till 1928 the \"Institute of the Dairy Industry and Economy\"). To some extent he was able to invoke his earlier expertise in colonial agriculture in support of his new department. Although the scope of his responsibilities was a broad one, his own research centred on the Karakul sheep, a hardy and, it turned out, adaptable breed originally from central Asia which continues to flourish in Namibia, having been introduced by German colonists to what was, till 1919, German South West Africa. The Karakul was introduced to Germany itself during the 1920s and 1930s with 9,758 registed in Germany in 1935 (though by 2013 the number had slumped to fewer than 300). For many years Golf also ran the \"Zeitschrift für Schafzucht\" (\"Journal for Sheep Husbandry\"). During the later 1920s and early 1930s Golf was also able to undertake further research expeditions, both to South West Africa, where many farmers of German origin still lived and worked despite the political changes and, during the first part of 1928, to what was at that time Soviet Central Asia. He also produced several pieces of research on problems of milk quality and directed Germany's first experiments involving introducing hormones into pig feed.\nThe , founded originally in 1887, continued its activities through and beyond the 1920s. Golf was a committed member of it during the years of political and social instability that dominated the agenda in Germany after 1918. He also became a member in 1920 of the German Popular Protection and Revanchism League (\"Deutschvölkische Schutz- und Trutzbund\" / DVSTB), a nationalist movement noted, even at the time, for its savage antisemitism. It was among the most prominent of various organisations that emerged as a reaction to the disaster of the First World War along with the unfolding economic, social and political crisis of the early 1920s. Because of the extent to which its beliefs were adopted and then integrated into government policy by the Nazi Party after 1933 the DVSTB acquired a retrospective significance that might well have surprised observers fifteen years earlier, .\nTowards the end of the 1920s populist political parties, notably the Communist Party and the Nazi Party, enjoyed growing support across Germany, especially (though by no means exclusively) in the industrial cities, while the more moderate traditional parties, both of the left and of the right, found themselves crowded out to the point at which, by 1932, it would become impossible to form a government in Germany without backing from the extremists. Political polarisation was reflected among students at the universities. Golf was an early admirer of Adolf Hitler and there are suggestions that at Leipzig University he was able to persuade some students to the Nazi cause. He himself joined the Nazi Party in 1932, being the first professor at the university to make the move. For the party he became a , identified as a link man between the university and the National Socialist German Students' League (\"Nationalsozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund\" / NSDStB).\nThe Nazis finally took power in January 1933. They lost no time in transforming the country into a one-party dictatorship. As a committed party member Golf suddenly found himself on the inside track with the political establishment. He was appointed Rector of the university between 1933 and 1935. Early in 1935 the Education Minister replaced him due to a perceived absence of vigour in pushing through of party policy (\"aufgrund \"mangelnden Durchsetzungsvermögens\"\"). However Felix Krueger, his successor evidently displayed similar shortcomings, and when Krueger was dismissed, Golf was reinstalled as university Rector for a further winter term, between October 1936 and March 1937. Earlier on he also served as university pro-dean and dean.\nAfter 1937, having reached the age of 60, he withdrew from high office at the university and returned with renewed energy to work on colonial agriculture. Beyond his university offices Golf held various honorary posts and memberships connected with his animal research work. In 1937 he was accepted into the Leopoldina.\nThe Invasion of Poland in September 1939 marked the return of war, and his energies were devoted increasingly to the simple business of keeping the university's research and teaching activities going. Golf died at Leipzig on 18 February 1941."

        "text": "The 2018 Monaco Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2018) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 27 May 2018 at the Circuit de Monaco, a street circuit that runs through the Principality of Monaco. It was the 6th round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship, the 76th time the Monaco Grand Prix had been held, and the 65th time it had been a round of the Formula One World Championship since the inception of the series in . It was the last victory for Daniel Ricciardo until the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\nThe race was won by Daniel Ricciardo in Red Bull, with Sebastian Vettel in Ferrari coming second. Lewis Hamilton in Mercedes finished third, maintaining the championship lead over Vettel. Mercedes also led in the Constructors' Championship ahead of Ferrari.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyres.\nThe race marked the competitive début of Pirelli's new hypersoft tyre compound.\nChassis updates.\nFollowing controversy over the use of winglets above halo-mounted rear view mirrors at the previous round in Spain, the FIA banned the winglets ahead of the race weekend.\nPenalties.\nRomain Grosjean was handed a three-place grid penalty for causing a collision on the opening lap of the Spanish Grand Prix. Max Verstappen received a 5 place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change, and a 10 place grid penalty for use of a third MGU-K, although this made no difference to his starting position, as he already was at the back of the grid.\nPractice.\nDaniel Ricciardo was fastest across all three practice sessions, improving his time in each successive session. In FP3, Max Verstappen crashed heavily at the Turn 16, meaning his car was damaged beyond repair for qualifying.\nQualifying.\nMax Verstappen was unable to compete in qualifying as his mechanics were unable to repair the car in time after a crash in the final practice session. Daniel Ricciardo set a new qualifying lap record to take pole position for the race. Red Bull capped both ends of the grid, Ricciardo starting first and Verstappen starting last. Pierre Gasly made Q3 for the second time, however his teammate, Brendon Hartley, after showing promise with P7 in FP3, qualified in P16 after being held up in traffic as well as being unhappy with the balance in his car.\nRace.\nRicciardo led going into the first corner with the top 6 staying in the same order. On lap 28, Ricciardo, still leading the race, complained of a loss of power to the team. Ricciardo was left to manage a wounded car for the remaining 50 laps of the race, with what was later revealed to be an MGU-K failure (giving him 25% less horsepower than usual), and with only six out of eight gears functioning. For the rest of the race he came under pressure from Sebastian Vettel, however due to dirty air and the track being difficult to pass, Vettel was unable to attack Ricciardo. Vettel lost a lot of time after Stoffel Vandoorne, around a lap behind Vettel and Ricciardo, came in between them both after pitting for a second time.\nSergey Sirotkin was given a 10-second stop-go penalty after his tyres were not fitted to the car at the 3 minute signal. On lap 53 Fernando Alonso retired at Sainte-Dévote due to gearbox problems, his first retirement of the 2018 season. A virtual safety car came out on lap 73 when Charles Leclerc's left front brake disc failed just before the Nouvelle Chicane, causing him to crash into the back of Brendon Hartley. Both drivers were forced to retire due to damage. This was the first Monaco Grand Prix since 2009 where a (full) safety car did not make an appearance, although there was a brief virtual safety car period. It was Ricciardo's most recent victory in Formula One until the 2021 Italian Grand Prix.\nPost race.\nAfter the race Hamilton and Alonso both complained that this was \"one of the most boring races ever\"; drivers were lapping several seconds a lap slower than they could have been to conserve tires and avoid making a second pit-stop. Alonso also pointed to the spread out field, \"as there were barely any yellow flags or safety cars.\""

        "title": "2018 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2018 British Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 2018 Rolex British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 8 July 2018 at the Silverstone Circuit in Silverstone, United Kingdom. The race was the 10th round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship. It marked the 73rd running of the British Grand Prix, the 69th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event, and the 52nd time that the World Championship event had been held at the Silverstone Circuit.\nFerrari driver Sebastian Vettel entered the race with a one-point lead over Lewis Hamilton in the Drivers' Championship. In the Constructors' Championship, Ferrari led Mercedes by ten points.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe circuit featured three drag reduction system (DRS) zones. The two used in previous years – positioned on the Wellington and Hangar Straights – returned, with a third zone placed on the pit straight. As DRS is deactivated when the driver brakes, drivers were able to use the system through the Abbey and Farm corners as these corners could be taken flat-out when the car is low on fuel. This brought increased risk as DRS reduces drag by cancelling out aerodynamic grip at a time when aerodynamic grip improves the car's ability to take corners at speed. Drivers were able to manually deactivate DRS before the corners if they were unable or unwilling to take the corner with the use of DRS. The race marked the first time that drivers were able to use DRS through corners in a race. The decision to allow the use of DRS through the corners drew criticism as drivers felt that using DRS through Abbey corner was unsafe. Drivers found the best approach was to manually deactivate DRS before the corner without slowing before reactivating it on the corner exit. This approach was necessary as slowing the car would prevent the system from being reactivated.\nPractice.\nThe first practice session saw Romain Grosjean crash at Abbey, after he left his DRS open whilst taking the corner, and Max Verstappen stopped on the pit straight with a gearbox issue. In second practice, Verstappen crashed at Luffield and Pierre Gasly's Toro Rosso broke down. In third practice, Brendon Hartley had a heavy crash after his front left suspension failed at high speed.\nQualifying.\nQ1 was red flagged as Lance Stroll went into the gravel and his car had to be removed. After an early showing from Ferrari, Hamilton took pole, his 6th around Silverstone. Ferrari qualified 2nd and 3rd, with Valtteri Bottas 4th. Hartley missed qualifying after the heavy crash in FP3, and started from the pit lane, along with Stroll and Sergey Sirotkin. Charles Leclerc made Q3 for the second time, qualifying in P9.\nRace.\nHamilton had a slow start and was jumped by Vettel and Bottas. At Turn 3, Kimi Räikkönen made contact with Hamilton, spinning him off the track and into last. Sergio Pérez also spun at the start, narrowly avoiding the Williams cars exiting the pit lane. Hartley failed to exit the pit lane. Räikkönen was given a 10-second time penalty for causing the collision between himself and Hamilton, which he served in the pits on lap 14. On lap 19, Leclerc retired after exiting the pits with a loose wheel. On lap 32, Marcus Ericsson crashed at Abbey, after failing to deactivate his DRS quick enough. This brought out a safety car, and both Ferraris and both Red Bulls pitted for a 2nd time, for the soft tyres. Mercedes chose to leave their drivers out to gain track position. On lap 38, Grosjean and Carlos Sainz crashed at Copse, causing another safety car. On lap 46, Verstappen spun and subsequently retired with a brake by wire issue. The next lap, Vettel overtook Bottas for the lead of the race, which he kept until the chequered flag, making it his second victory at Silverstone, the first since 2009. Vettel became the first Ferrari driver to win at Silverstone since Fernando Alonso in 2011. Vettel's win broke Mercedes's 5-race winning streak at the British Grand Prix."

In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by 15 points.\nKimi Räikkönen took the fastest pole position in Formula 1 history with a time of 1:19.119, breaking the record set by Rubens Barrichello in 2004. Räikkönen's previous pole was at the 2017 Monaco Grand Prix.\nRace report.\nThe race was won by Lewis Hamilton after a battle with Kimi Räikkönen, Hamilton caught and passed Räikkönen with 9 laps remaining. On the opening lap Hamilton and Vettel collided causing Vettel to spin off. Despite Vettel's complaints, the stewards deemed it just a racing incident. Vettel would later fight back to 4th place, behind Valtteri Bottas in third. Max Verstappen was penalised 5 seconds after forcing Bottas off the track after a pit stop and was classified 5th. Sergey Sirotkin, driving for Williams, scored his only Formula 1 championship point, after Romain Grosjean was disqualified from 6th place after Renault successfully lodged a protest due to his Haas carrying an illegal floor, thus ensuring that for the first time ever in Formula One, all drivers who entered and finished every race in the season scored at least a point."

        "text": "The 2018 Japanese Grand Prix (formally known as the Formula 1 2018 Honda Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One racing event held on 7 October 2018 at the Suzuka International Racing Course in Suzuka in the Mie Prefecture, Japan. The race was the seventeenth round of the 2018 FIA Formula One World Championship and marked the 44th running of the Japanese Grand Prix. The 2018 event was the 34th time that the race had been run as a World Championship event since the inaugural season in , and the 30th time that it had been held at Suzuka.\nMercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the round with a fifty-point lead over Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel in the World Drivers' Championship. Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas sat third, a further 67 points behind. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes held a lead of fifty-three points over Ferrari, with Red Bull Racing a further one hundred and fifty points behind in third place.\nReport.\nBackground.\nFerrari introduced a new livery, carrying the logo of Mission Winnow, a joint promotion with major sponsor Philip Morris International.\nPirelli opted to bring the supersoft, the soft, and the medium tire to the 2018 Japanese Grand Prix. Lewis Hamilton was the defending winner, having won the previous round in Russia. He was also the defending winner at Suzuka, having won the previous Japanese Grand Prix in 2017. Weather was a potential factor, with a chance of rain through many sessions of the weekend.\nQualifying.\nLewis Hamilton claimed pole position for the race and claimed his 80th pole position in his career. His teammate Valtteri Bottas finished second, and together they achieved Mercedes’ fifth one two in qualifying in a row at Suzuka. Rain was a factor in the Q2 and Q3 sessions. Mercedes’ strategy was key to their one two as they sent both their drivers out on supersoft tires, despite the chance for rain in the Q3 session.\nHamilton’s main title rival, Sebastian Vettel, as well as his teammate Kimi Raikkonen, was sent out by Ferrari on Intermediates. However, neither Raikkonen nor Vettel completed their laps, and switched to supersofts immediately. Not being on the track on the correct tire at the optimal time, Vettel could only manage 9th after he made a mistake on his lap on the dry tires. Max Verstappen and Kimi Raikkonen started third and fourth respectively. Vettel would start 8th after Esteban Ocon received a 3 place grid penalty for ignoring red flags in Free Practice 3.\nOther noteworthy qualifying performances include Romain Grosjean qualifying 5th for Haas, and Brendon Hartley achieving his best ever starting position of 6th in his Toro Rosso. Hatley's teammate Pierre Gasly, lined up behind him in 7th. Daniel Ricciardo failed to set a time in Q2 due to power unit issues and started 15th as a result. The noteworthy incident of qualifying, apart from he rain, was Marcus Ericsson, who hit the Barriers in Q1 and brought out the red flag.\nBoth Hamilton and Bottas, along with Grosjean, completed their fastest laps in Q2 on soft tires. As they progressed to Q3, they would start the race on softs. All other Q3 drivers qualified in Q2 on supersofts. Everybody who had a free choice of tire started on the softs, apart from Nico Hulkenberg who opted for the mediums.\nRace.\nRace start.\nHamilton got a good start and led from pole position. Bottas also started well and preserved the Mercedes one two. Vettel started well and was in fifth by the end of lap 1. Also on lap 1, Lance Stroll pushed Fernando Alonso off the track. Stroll would later receive a five second penalty for this, but Alonso would also receive a five second penalty for the same incident as he was deemed to have gained an advantage by going off the track. On lap 2, Verstappen pushed Raikkonen off the track when rejoining the track, and Vettel took fourth as a result. Verstappen would be given a five second penalty for this incident. By lap 3, Riccardo had reached 10th position from his starting grid position of 15th.\nOn lap 3, the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to clear up debris from the incident between Charles Leclerc and Kevin Magnussen on the pit straight. Magnussen had moved across the track to defend from Leclerc, with Leclerc moving to avoid Magnussen, and crashing into his rear. The incident gave Magnussen a puncture and Leclerc a broken front wing. Both would pit shortly to fix the damage that resulted from the incident. Magnussen's lap to return to the pits with his puncture created much of the debris that needed to be cleaned up during the safety car period.\nMid-race.\nThe safety car period ended on lap 7. On lap 8, Vettel proceeded to attack Verstappen, however, an overtake attempt on the third placed Verstappen sent Vettel spinning, and resulted in him rejoining the race in 19th. Verstappen sustained some floor damage to his car as a result of this incident, and Vettel also took some damage to his sidepods. The stewards deemed this collision to be a racing incident, and as such, no penalties were handed out.\nOn Lap 9, Magnussen would retire his car from the damage it sustained in the collision with Leclerc. On lap 13, Ricciardo overtook Pierre Gasly for 6th, and a lap later, he would take fifth position from Grosjean. Raikkonen was the first of the frontrunners to pit, on lap 18, and swapped his supersofts for medium tires. He was followed by Verstappen on lap 22 pitting onto the softs, who was able to preserve third over Raikkonen despite serving his five second penalty.\nBoth Bottas and Ricciardo pitted on lap 23, both onto mediums, with Ricciardo able to overcut Raikkonen to take fourth position. A lap later Hamilton would also pit onto mediums, meaning at this point all the frontrunners had completed their first stops. On lap 27, Vettel, who had climbed to 10th position by this point, pit for soft tires. On lap 36, after overtaking a few cars, and a few pitstops by midfield drivers, Vettel would take 6th. On lap 39, Hulkenberg would retire his car to become the second DNF. He would be followed by Leclerc who retired his car by stopping on the side of the track. This brought out the Virtual Safety Car, and racing would resume in lap 42.\nFinish.\nThe top 5 would stay in their positions to the finish. Hamilton picked up his 71st career victory, and his ninth win of the season, having led every lap of the race. It also marked his 50th win at Mercedes. Bottas picked up his first podium finish in Suzuka with his second place result, and with Hamilton’s victory, combined for Mercedes’ 44th one-two result. Verstappen was close to Bottas for the last few laps of the race, but was unable to overtake, and took 3rd place. He picked up his third podium in three races at Suzuka. Vettel finished the race in 6th position, but was able to take the fastest lap of the race on the last lap. Sergio Perez finished in 7th to claim the “best of the rest” position for Force India.\nThis win moved Hamilton 67 points clear of Vettel in the Driver’s Championship Standings. Beating Vettel by 8 points in the next round in the United States would win Hamilton his fifth Driver’s World Championship. This race also left Perez, Magnussen, and Hulkenberg tied for the same number of points in the championship. All three were battling for the best of the rest position of 7th behind the 6 big team drivers. Perez held 7th after Suzuka thanks to his 3rd place finish in the Azerbaijan Grand Prix.\nPost race.\nIn post race interviews, Vettel blamed his spin on Verstappen, stating that he had not been left “enough room”. Verstappen put the blame on Vettel, claiming that the Spoon curve, where the incident occurred, is not a spot to overtake. He claimed that Vettel “understeered into” him. Verstappen also expressed his disappointment with the five second penalty he incurred for his rejoining incident with Raikkonen, stating that he rejoined the track “in a safe way” and that he felt that Raikkonen should have waited for him to reenter the track. Lewis Hamilton would describe himself as “very, very happy” with his drive, also describing the weekend as “very strong” for the team."

Lovett set up the Australian Indoors tennis tournament, which ran from 1973 to 1994 (he was also on the ATP board). In 1982 Lovett founded Sport Australia. He was involved in many different sports such as rugby league, swimming, cricket, basketball, triathlon and squash. He was involved in Sydney's successful Olympic bid for the 2000 Olympics, though died of cancer a few months before the Olympics were held. Outside of sports, Lovett was chairman of the Sydney Eye Hospital Foundation. He first entered the Australian tennis championships in 1956 and lost in round one to Don Candy. At the 1957 championships, Lovett beat Mike Davies before being beaten easily by Neale Fraser in the quarter-finals. In 1958 he lost in round two to Bob Howe."

Held in the Hong Kong Coliseum, the Esports Festival was organized by the Hong Kong Tourism Board in order to strengthen Hong Kong as a tourist destination for the younger generation. This event featured a \"Street Fighter V\" tournament that one of the 2017 Capcom Pro Tour Premier Events. The Hong Kong Esports Festival also featured a \"League of Legends\" tournament with teams consisting of players from various countries.\nBackground.\nThe Hong Kong Esports Festival was held in the Hong Kong Coliseum in Hung Hom in the weekend from August 25 to 28, 2017. The event was organized by the Hong Kong Tourism Board and funded HK$35 million from the Hong Kong government. The Esports Festival was expected to draw in 50,000 visitors, 10% of which would come from overseas. In an interview with the \"South China Morning Post\", general manager of event and product development at the Tourism Board Mason Hung Chung-hing stated that the organizers hope that \"through the festival we will be able to make Hong Kong a destination for the younger generation.\" Sony Interactive Entertainment set up PlayStation consoles outside of the coliseum.\nAlso serving as a music festival, the Esports Festival featured performances by Korean pop stars and bands such as Exo and Super Junior.\n\"Street Fighter V\" tournament.\n\"Street Fighter V\" was the only fighting game played competitively at the Hong Kong Esports Festival. This tournament was livestreamed by the CapcomFighters Twitch channel. The tournament was won by Daigo \"The Beast\" Umehara, defeating Kanamori \"Gachikun\" Tsunehori in the finals. Playing as Guile, Daigo gained the upper hand in an earlier match against Tsunehori by flooding the stage with ranged attacks, knocking his opponent into the loser's bracket. When the two met again in the grand final, Tsunehori won the first set against Daigo 3-0, but Daigo was able to defeat his opponent in the second set. The Esports Festival was the first Premier Event tournament Daigo had won in nearly a year, and this win essentially guaranteed him a spot in the 2017 Capcom Cup.\nCapcom first announced the downloadable content \"Street Fighter\" character Menat at the Hong Kong Esports Festival, revealing her in a trailer during a break in the top 8 of the tournament.\nCapcom Pro Tour was cancelled for the 2019 tournament due to the Hong Kong protests.\n\"League of Legends\" tournament.\nA three-day \"League of Legends\" tournament was held at the Hong Kong Esports Festival.

        "title": "Golf Story",
        "text": "Golf Story is a 2017 video game developed and published by Australian studio Sidebar Games for the Nintendo Switch. The game was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on 28 September 2017. \"Golf Story\" is an adventure game with role-playing (RPG) elements based on the sport of golf. Originally designed as a Wii U release, \"Golf Story\" had a lengthy development time, and Sidebar sought assistance from Nintendo to finish the game and release it for the Switch. It was influenced by the Game Boy Color version of \"Mario Golf\", released in 1999.\nThe game received generally positive reviews, with critics praising the game's tone, story and characters but the RPG mechanics and lack of originality being less well received. The game was nominated for several awards and won the best original sports game at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards. A sequel, \"Sports Story\" was released for the Switch in December 2022.\nGameplay and synopsis.\n\"Golf Story\" is a top-down adventure game based on the sport of golf. The game follows a down-on-his-luck golfer attempting to reclaim his childhood love of the game, passed down to him by his father, after not playing the game for 20 years. The player character attempts to impress his estranged wife and play on the professional tour.\nThe game is presented as a traditional role-playing game (RPG), with the character gaining skills in power and accuracy. The game features eight unique areas each filled with side quests and minigames that allow the player to earn experience and money, which can be used to develop the player's skills and purchase new equipment. Each area includes a nine-hole golf course that can be played after certain missions are completed. Golf is played a three-click system, in which player clicks once to aim, once to set power, and once to set accuracy. The player is capable of playing shots from any location, allowing them to obtain collectables and secrets. In addition to traditional golf, the game also features a handful of cousin sports, including disc golf, miniature golf, an Atari-like golfing mini game, a driving range, and bowls.\nDevelopment and release.\n\"Golf Story\" was originally in development as a Wii U title by Sidebar Games, a development studio made up of a two-man team from Queensland, Australia. This was set to be Sidebar Games' first home console release, having worked on smaller games for the prior eight years. Due to a lengthy development time from expansion of the game's scope, development moved over to the Nintendo Switch after the end of Wii U's lifespan. This also allowed Sidebar to get assistance from Nintendo to finish development of the game. Golf Story was influenced by various past golf video game titles, and particularly the Game Boy Color version of \"Mario Golf\". A split-screen two player story mode was originally planned for \"Golf Story\", but was cut before release.\n\"Golf Story\" was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on 28 September 2017, and in Japan on 9 March 2018, published by Flyhigh Works. A limited physical retail release, published by Limited Run Games in North America, became available starting on 28 September 2018. Downloadable content was originally planned for the game's post-release, adding more courses, but focus instead shifted in favour of a sequel.\nReception.\nThe game received \"generally favourable reviews\" according to media review aggregator website \"Metacritic\", based on 39 critic reviews. Critics were positive about the games feel and its charm. Martin Robinson writing for \"Eurogamer\" called it \"one of the finer games you'll find on Nintendo's Switch this year,\" Robinson also said that despite the game not being the best golf game or RPG, it was a \"irresistible and harmonious combination\" of the two. Gita Jackson of \"Kotaku\" said \"\"Golf Story\" is a Nintendo Switch RPG you should play,\" and despite not being a fan of golf, they had a newfound appreciation for the game.\nThe game also gained appreciation for its story and characters. \"Pocket Gamer\"'s Emily Sowden commented \"the golfing element is fun, the story is interesting, the characters are great, and the game's unlike most of the things we've seen on Switch so far.\" Andrew Reiner of Game Informer commented \"Golf Story makes you care about the characters and their world just as much as sinking a do-or-die putt\" before calling it a \"breath of fresh air\". A review from Miguel Angel Escudero writing for \"IGN\" said it \"overflows with charisma\". Ginny Woo writing for \"GameSpot\" commented, \"successfully captured the trappings of yesteryear's RPGs, and the witticisms and idiosyncrasies of the characters you encounter are a great palate cleanser between rounds.\"\nWhile the majority of the reviews were mostly positive, some reviewers felt the RPG was lacking in crucial areas, such as game mechanics and originality. Kay Purcell for Gaming Trend reported, \"\"Golf Story\" is held back by a number of mechanics, some of which are not very fleshed out or enjoyable.\" RPGamer's Alex Fuller also noted \"...it can be argued that the game doesn't provide anything overly new...\".\n\"Eurogamer\" ranked \"Golf Story\" 50th on their list of the \"Top 50 Games of 2017\", while Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked it 24th in their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.\nAwards.\nThe game was nominated for \"Best Switch Game\" in \"Destructoid\"s Game of the Year Awards 2017, and for \"Best Switch Game\" and \"Best RPG\" in IGN's Best of 2017 Awards. It won the award for \"Biggest Surprise\" in \"Game Informer\"s 2017 RPG of the Year Awards.\nSequel.\nOn 10 December 2019, a sequel was announced in a Nintendo Indie World showcase. The game, titled \"Sports Story\", features more types of sports in addition to golf, such as tennis, soccer, cricket, and volleyball, and retains the first game's mix of sports, role-playing, and adventure gameplay. Originally set for a mid-2020 release as a Nintendo Switch exclusive, it was ultimately released on 23 December 2022."

        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team represents the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I. The program's first game was an 11–8 win over the Lincoln YMCA in 1897. Three years later, Nebraska played its first game against another university, a 37–5 victory over Nebraska Wesleyan. The program has an all-time record of 1,573–1,442, with eight NCAA tournament appearances and 16 NIT appearances.\nNebraska has the distinction of being the only major conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament, and did not make the tournament until 1986. Much of the team's modest success came during the 14-year tenure of Danny Nee, Nebraska's all-time winningest head coach. Nee led the Cornhuskers to five of their seven NCAA Tournament appearances and six NIT bids, including the 1996 NIT championship, NU's only national postseason title. After Nee was fired in 2000, Barry Collier was hired and led the program for six years, until leaving to become athletic director at Butler University. Nebraska then hired Doc Sadler from UTEP, who led the Cornhuskers through the school's transition from the Big 12 to the Big Ten, but like Collier, failed to make an NCAA Tournament appearance. Tim Miles took Nebraska to the tournament in his second season, but did not make it back, and was fired in 2019, when Nebraska hired former Chicago Bulls head coach Fred Hoiberg."

SSA is also an affiliate of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (SASCOC), which, alongside Sport and Recreation South Africa (SRSA) supervises all organised sport in South Africa.\nSSA is responsible for the control of all aspects of Surfing in South Africa, from entry-level participation to the management of the elite level Pro Surf Tour (PST). Provincial bodies, along with the SA Longboarding Association, the SA Bodyboarding Association and the SA Students Surfing Association are all affiliated to Surfing South Africa.\nHistory.\nSurfing as a sport in South Africa started in Durban around the 1940s. The South African Surfing Association (SAFA) was founded in 1965. Around the middle of the 1960s surfing began to reach popularity worldwide, surfers from South Africa were at the vanguard of this movement. The popular surf film The Endless Summer endeared many people to the waves of Kwazulu Natal, the Western Cape and the Eastern Cape.\nThis exposure led to the hosting of many surfing competitions in South Africa. The Gunston 500 was first hosted at Bay of Plenty Beach in Durban in 1969. The Gunston grew into a major South African sporting attraction during the holiday season attracting huge crowds to the Durban beachfront. Other events, including the 1978 ISA World Championships at Nahoon Reef in East London were hosted followed by the Spur Steak Ranch Surfabouts, that used a mobile venue and featured many of the best surfers in the world during the mid 1980s and the Billabong Pro contests hosted in Jeffreys Bay. Following it all was the Quiksilver ISA World Surfing Games held in Durban in 2002 and the Mr Price Pro competition that replaced the Gunston 500"

        "title": "2023 Rugby World Cup bids",
        "text": "Three bids to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup (RWC2023) were submitted to World Rugby by the June 2017 deadline, with France selected on 15 November 2017 ahead of Ireland and South Africa. Italy withdrew its bid in September 2016, while Argentina and the United States initially expressed interest but ultimately decided against a formal bid. RWC2023 will be France's first time as sole host, having been principal host in 2007, co-host in 1991, and subsidiary host in 1999.\nSchedule.\nIn 2010, it was reported that World Rugby might select the hosts for the 2023 and 2027 at the same time, as they did with the 2015 and 2019 tournaments. Later this idea was dropped. The bidding schedule was as follows:\nThe bidding process formally kicked off on 14 May 2015. World Rugby held a meeting with five potential Rugby World Cup 2023 hosts on 6 May 2015 in London that was attended by representatives from Ireland, Italy, South Africa, France and the United States. Apart from the U.S., the countries attending had all previously publicly announced their interest to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\nOn 3 July 2015 World Rugby confirmed interest from the following four nations by the deadline of 15 June 2015:\nConfirmed bidders.\nSouth Africa.\nSouth Africa was considered one of the frontrunners to host the 2023 competition, having hosted the 1995 tournament and bid unsuccessfully for the right to host the 2011, 2015, and 2019 tournaments.\nIn April 2016 the South African government banned its own rugby union from bidding to stage the 2023 World Cup over its failure to provide enough opportunities for black players. SA Rugby sought urgent talks with sports minister Fikile Mbalula in an effort to get its ban lifted in time for it to bid for the Rugby World Cup 2023. Jurie Roux, the chief executive of SA Rugby stated \"There is no question that we have more work to do and we could be moving faster, but our sport has undergone a major overhaul in the past two or three years and we have definitely made great progress.\"\nSouth Africa confirmed the bid on 9 May 2017 after the ban was lifted. There are optimistic projections of a R27 billion injection to the local economy by hosting the event, with a focus on eight stadiums across seven cities.\nIreland.\nThe Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive, together with the Irish Rugby Football Union, formally announced on 5 December 2014 their intentions to launch a bid to host the event. Dick Spring, former Tánaiste and Ireland rugby player, and Chair of Ireland's Rugby World Cup 2023 bid, stated in May 2015 that Ireland already had received pledges of support from 40% of World Rugby's board's 27 votes. Ireland's bid included both rugby and Gaelic games grounds. The 82,000 capacity GAA stadium Croke Park would host the final, while other newly redeveloped GAA stadia such as Casement Park, Fitzgerald Stadium, MacHale Park and Páirc Uí Chaoimh would be part of the bid. In July 2017, emergency legislation was passed by the Oireachtas to grant the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport the explicit statutory authority to make the financial guarantees which Rugby World Cup Limited required.\nOn 15 November 2016, 12 stadia were announced as being part of the bid. The provisional list included 's home stadium, Aviva Stadium, the home grounds of Leinster, Munster and Ulster, and eight GAA grounds, with two of these from each province. Some sites, such as Páirc Uí Chaoimh and Casement Park, were then undergoing renovations or expansions. Their planned capacities, as were listed on the IRFU's website, are provided.\nFrance.\nFrance, which hosted the 2007 Rugby World Cup, expressed interest in hosting the 2023 tournament.\nFrance launched its bid on 9 February 2017 revealing 19 potential host cities and an environmentally friendly transport plan. On 17 March, 12 host cities were selected. This list was later reduced to 9 cities (excluding Paris, Montpellier and Lens) :\nHosting recommendation and decision.\nOn 31 October 2017, the Rugby World Cup Limited Board submitted a comprehensive evaluation report of the bidders. The report stated that all three countries were capable of hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup, and recommended South Africa as the preferred host in light of the report's scoring. The evaluation report included a summary of the scoring: \nThe biggest differentiating factor among scoring was for venues. South Africa has an ample number of large and modern stadiums by virtue of its hosting the 2010 FIFA World Cup. By contrast, Ireland has not hosted a tournament of similar magnitude, and its stadiums would require significant technology and telecom upgrades to meet RWC requirements.\nThe evaluation report was met with criticism from French and Irish sources. The President of the French Rugby Federation, Bernard Laporte questioned why France, which had recently hosted the successful UEFA Euro 2016 football tournament, scored lower than South Africa for both stadiums and hotels. Irish media questioned why all three countries received the same score on security; South Africa has the eighth highest murder rate in the world, over 50 times higher than Ireland's rate, while France had suffered numerous terrorist attacks in 2012–17, leading to over 200 deaths. Additionally, the report included limited reference to the fact that Durban, South Africa had initially won the right to host the 2022 Commonwealth Games, before the Commonwealth Games Federation was forced to strip Durban of hosting rights for failure to deliver on key obligations and commitments.\nThe evaluation report by the Rugby World Cup Limited Board states that French law considers a criminal offence to use, hold or sell drugs. The French bid states that this \"would have no impact on RWC 2023 as a tournament, including the participating teams\", but it \"has not provided any official government documentation to support this statement and therefore this could pose a risk to the tournament and participating teams\". According to the report, RWCL \"did not specifically request government commitment at this stage\".\nThe World Rugby Council voted on 15 November 2017 to award the 2023 World Cup hosting rights to France. In the first round of voting, no country achieved a majority. Ireland were then eliminated as they gained the fewest votes in the first round. France defeated South Africa in the second round of voting. Council members reportedly preferred the financial superiority of the French bid. According to ESPN, \"France's proposal guaranteed a net revenue return of £350 million for World Rugby to invest back into the game; Ireland and South Africa's in turn came in at around £270m.\" After the vote, IRFU chief executive Philip Browne conceded that last-placed Ireland could not match the other two countries financial offer and stadiums, and questioned whether World Rugby would allow a small country to host the World Cup.\nThe council voting was as follows:\nDeclined or withdrew bid.\nItaly.\nThe Italian Rugby Federation (FIR) confirmed in March 2015 its intention to bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. \nOn 12 August 2016, the Italian Rugby Federation announced the 12 stadiums they expressed interest in using for the 2023 event.\nHowever, on September 28, 2016, Italy officially withdrew from the competition to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup, after the decision of the Mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi, to decline the bid of Rome to host the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nUnited States.\nThe United States was anticipated to bid and was considered a possible contender to host the 2023 or 2027 Rugby World Cup. World Rugby CEO Mike Miller stated in 2010 that the United States would host a Rugby World Cup, stating that \"it's a question of when, not if.\" However, in 2023 United States was chosen as Host Nation for 2031 Rugby World Cup\nArgentina.\nArgentina's World Rugby Council representative Agustín Pichot stated that Argentina wanted to host the 2023 tournament. In May 2016, following a meeting with Pichot, Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced government support for a 2027 Rugby World Cup bid."

        "title": "Jonathan Taylor (American football)",
        "text": "Jonathan Taylor (born January 19, 1999) is an American football running back for the Indianapolis Colts of the National Football League (NFL). Taylor played high school football at Salem High School, where he set a New Jersey state rushing yards record. He played three seasons of college football at Wisconsin, where he finished his college career as the sixth all-time rusher in the NCAA and became the first player in history to rush for more than 6,000 yards in any three-year span.\nTaylor finished in the top ten of Heisman Trophy voting three times, was named a unanimous first-team All-American, and was a recipient of the Doak Walker Award in both the 2018 and 2019 seasons. Taylor was selected in the second round of the 2020 NFL draft with the 41st pick by the Colts. With the Colts, Taylor led the NFL in both rushing yards and touchdowns in 2021, becoming a unanimous All-Pro and Pro Bowler in the same season.\nEarly years.\nTaylor was born in Salem, New Jersey, to Elizabeth Taylor and Jonathan James. His father played basketball for San Francisco State from 1982 to 1986. Taylor attended Salem High School. During his high school football career, he amassed 4,642 rushing yards and 51 touchdowns. As a senior, he set the New Jersey record with 2,815 rushing yards, which had been held by former Wisconsin Badgers running back Corey Clement. In his senior season, Taylor averaged 234.6 yards a game, rushing for 35 touchdowns and scoring 37 total touchdowns. During his senior year, he was honored with the Jim Henry Award as the high school area player of the year for New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware. Taylor was also an accomplished performer in track and field, and he won two state titles in the 100-meter dash, his best time being 10.49 seconds.\n247Sports rated Taylor as a three-star prospect and the 24th-highest ranked running back in the class of 2017. He committed to play college football at Rutgers University but later changed it to the University of Wisconsin–Madison on November 1, 2016.\nCollege career.\nFreshman season.\nAfter fall camp, Taylor opened his freshman year at Wisconsin in 2017 as one of the team's starting running backs alongside Bradrick Shaw and Chris James. In his first career game against Utah State, he rushed for 87 yards over nine carries and a touchdown. In his second game, against Florida Atlantic, he rushed for 223 yards and three touchdowns. After Taylor ran for 249 yards against Nebraska in the fifth game of the season, he entered the Heisman Trophy conversation and was routinely listed among the top-five Heisman candidates. In the following game, Taylor had 30 carries for 219 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown against Purdue in a 17–9 victory.\nOn October 21, 2017, Taylor reached the 1,000-yard rushing mark in his seventh game, matching the FBS freshman record for fewest games to reach 1,000 yards; the previous backs to accomplish this feat were Florida's Emmitt Smith (1987), San Diego State's Marshall Faulk (1991), Oklahoma's Adrian Peterson (2004), North Texas' Jamario Thomas (2004) and Wisconsin's P. J. Hill (2006). Taylor rushed for 183 yards on 29 carries with a touchdown in Wisconsin's 45–17 win over Indiana on November 4, winning his fifth Big Ten Freshman of the Week award.\nOn October 30, Taylor was named a semifinalist for the Maxwell Award. On November 17, he was named a semifinalist for the Doak Walker Award given to the top running back in the country. Just three days later, he was named one of three Doak Walker Award finalists, along with Penn State's Saquon Barkley and Stanford's Bryce Love. Following the final game of the season against Wisconsin's rival Minnesota, Taylor won his eighth Big Ten Freshman of the Week award. He set a new Big Ten record as he surpassed Ohio State quarterback J. T. Barrett's record of seven Big Ten Freshman of the Week awards set in 2013. Taylor was listed as a consensus first-team All-Big Ten pick by the Big Ten coaches and media on November 27, 2017, and was named the conference's freshman of the year. He finished sixth in the Heisman Trophy voting.\nTaylor finished his freshman season with 1,977 rushing yards and 13 touchdowns, finishing second all-time in rushing yards among FBS freshmen, behind fellow Wisconsin running back Ron Dayne (2,109 yards in 1996). The NCAA does not include bowl-game stats for the period Dayne played, so Taylor is the official record holder for freshman rushing yards. Taylor led the Big Ten in rushing yards, while finishing third in the FBS in rushing yards and second in the Big Ten in rushing touchdowns behind Barkley. He helped the Badgers to a school-record-setting 13 wins, an appearance in the 2017 Big Ten Championship Game, and a victory over Miami (FL) in the Orange Bowl.\nSophomore season.\nTaylor entered the 2018 season as a consensus preseason All-American and was featured on watch lists for the Maxwell Award, the Doak Walker Award, and the Walter Camp Award. Taylor's return, as well as those of many other key members of the 2017 Orange Bowl-winning Wisconsin team, led the Badgers to become ranked fourth in the preseason AP Poll, tied for the highest start in school history. He was the seventh-ranked college football player by ESPN during the preseason.\nTaylor started off the season with 18 carries for 145 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns in a 34–3 victory over Western Kentucky. In the second game, Taylor set a career-high with 253 rushing yards, to go along with three touchdowns, in a 45–14 win over New Mexico. He was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. Taylor again eclipsed the 200-yard mark when he put up 221 yards and three touchdowns on 24 attempts (9.1 yards per attempt) against Nebraska on October 6. However, the Badgers faltered, losing five regular-season games and soon falling out of the rankings. On November 3, Taylor had 27 carries for 208 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns in a 31–17 victory over Rutgers. In a triple-overtime win over Purdue on November 17, he put up a career-high 321 yards and three touchdowns.

        "text": "Clitheroe Cricket Club is a cricket club which plays its home games at the Clitheroe Cricket Bowling &amp; Tennis Club ground on Chatburn Road in Clitheroe, Lancashire, England. From 2017, it plays in the Lancashire League, having resigned the Ribblesdale League at the end of the 2016 season.\nCurrently there are 4 senior sides, and a junior section which fields 9 teams.\nHistory.\nClitheroe cricket club had its origins in the Alhambra CC which was formed in 1860, the first organisation to call itself the towns club. The Alhambra club was so named because a circus with that title was accustomed to install itself on the field that became the cricket ground, believed to be behind the Wheatsheaf Inn on Whalley Road. It was in 1862 that the Alhambra club joined with the local junior club – the Rifle Corps – to form Clitheroe Cricket Club. \nThis followed a meeting at the Brownlow Arms (now the Yorkshire bank building) where the title of Clitheroe Cricket Club and a code of rules were agreed upon.\nA new ground was secured in Chatburn Road, not the present field, but one immediately below. The club did so well in gathering subscriptions, that after a year or two they were able to aspire to a real playing pitch, not a rented meadow, which was laid in the next field. This has been the clubs home ever since.\nIn the early days fixtures were against Great Harwood, Settle, Leyland, Haslingden, Bacup, Rishton, Church, Whitefield Stand (Manchester), Cob Wall (Blackburn), Eagley, Whalley, Skipton, Keighley, Sabden, Gargrave, Egerton and Calder Vale. Wickets were pitched early at 11.00am and consisted of two innings. Cricket at the time were friendly games but nevertheless, keenly fought. Then in 1892 the idea of league cricket with points and a championship at stake came about, due mainly in an attempt to increase crowds and revenue. Clitheroe reluctantly joined with other clubs to form the Ribblesdale League.\nIn 1920 the Chatburn road site was purchased by the Southworth family, who bestowed it to the club forever. In the unhappy event of the clubs extinction, the ownership of the field passes to the citizens of Clitheroe as a recreational area.\nThe first pavilion was erected in 1862, in the form of a big tent. There were two more wooden pavilions before the present facilities were completed in 1981.\nThe club won the Ribblesdale League title four years in a row between 2013-2016. From start of the 2017 season Clitheroe, along with local rivals Great Harwood, moved to the Lancashire League.\nHonours.\nRibblesdale League\nLancashire League\nJunior Section.\nRecent years have seen increased interest in junior cricket at Clitheroe and the club recognised the need for a more structured coaching programme. This needed to be delivered by appropriately qualified coaches, equipped with the latest resources and teaching aids. Consequently over the past ten years a concentrated effort has been made to increase the number of ECB qualified coaches, in addition to adopting all the relevant Child Protection legislation and appointment of Child welfare and Protection Officers. Coaching is held every Thursday during the season.\nIn 2017 the club had over 150 junior members and 9 teams playing in the Lancashire League from under 9's to under 19's; The under 19's group, captained in 2017 by 1st XI opener Charlie Dewhurst, became county champions for the 3rd time, having previously achieved that honour at u13's and u15's level."

        "text": "This is a list of sailing ships of the Venetian navy. From the Cretan War to the fall of the Republic of Venice in 1797, the Venetian Republic maintained a good number of sailing ships for its navy, which formed the so-called \"Armada Grossa\", as opposed to the galley-based \"Armada Sottile\". The vast majority of those ships were built in the Venetian Arsenal as some of its roofed shipbuilding docks were enlarged to allow construction of sailing vessels.\nShips of the Line.\nFirst-rate vessels.\nAccording to the classification used in the Venetian navy, those ('first-rate') vessels comprised every two-decked ship armed with more than 62 guns. Usually, the ordnance varied from 68 to 74 guns, but the greatest part of those ships were 70-gun vessels. Since the second half of the 18th century and the appearance of the heavy frigates, the class comprised only ships with more than 68 guns, and those ships of the line were simply called \"line vessels\".\nSecond-rate vessels.\nThe ('second-rate') Venetian ships of the line were two-deckers with an armament that varied from 48 to 66 guns. They served as support to the main battle line of \"primo rango\" vessels and as scouting ships. After the Peace of Passarowitz in 1718 and the decline of Venetian naval strength, their number was greatly reduced, and from the second half of the 18th century their roles were taken by newly built frigates.\nThird-rate vessels.\nThe distinction between and ('third-rate') Venetian ships of the line was based more on roles that on main armament. Those ships carried from 52 to 40 guns, but had the only role of scouting vessels. As with the second-rate vessels, after Passarowitz the number of ships of this type was slowly diminished and substituted with newly built frigates."

Moreover, the top ten teams in the qualifying phase qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup, joining the six hexagonal participants.\nThe group phase of the Nations League, consisting of three tiered leagues, was played in the official FIFA match windows in September, October, and November 2019. All eligible teams were assigned by sporting performance into Leagues A, B, and C. Each league was sub-divided into four groups, featuring promotion and relegation, in which the teams competed in a home-and-away, round-robin format over the course of the group phase.\nLeague A contained twelve teams, split into four groups of three teams. The six hexagonal participants were joined by the top six teams from qualifying. The four group winners qualified for the Nations League final championship, played in June 2021, which determined the champions of the new competition. The four teams which finished last in their group were relegated to League B for the next edition of the tournament.\nLeague B consisted of sixteen teams, split into four groups of four teams. The league contained teams which finished from 7th to 22nd in qualifying. The four group winners were promoted to League A, while the four teams which finished last in their group were relegated to League C for the next edition.\nLeague C consisted of the remaining thirteen member associations, the teams which finished 23rd to 34th in qualifying, along with Guatemala, who did not enter qualifying. The league contained four groups, with three groups of three teams and one group of four teams. The four group winners were promoted to League B for the next edition of the competition.\nIn September 2019, it was announced that the Nations League would also provide qualification for all sixteen teams participating in the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup (no teams would qualify automatically).\nThe following teams qualified for the Gold Cup after group play concluded in November 2019:\nInitially, the final four spots at the Gold Cup were to be determined by two-legged matches between the second-place finishers of League B and the first-place finishers of League C, to be played in March 2020. The four winners of this round would then advance to the second round, to face the third-place finishers of League A, in matches to be played in June 2020. The four matchup winners of the second round would qualify for the 2021 Gold Cup. However, following the COVID-19 pandemic, this format was changed. In July 2020, CONCACAF announced that the qualifiers would be played by the twelve aforementioned teams as a centralized preliminary round in the United States, in the week prior to the 2021 Gold Cup group stage. In September 2020, CONCACAF announced that Qatar were invited to the Gold Cup as guests, and that the qualification tournament would determine the last three teams to participate in the group stage of the Gold Cup. The qualification tournament will feature two rounds, with the twelve participating teams divided into six one-off ties in the first round. The six winners will advance to the second round, with the winners of the three one-off matches qualifying for the Gold Cup.\nTiebreakers.\nThe ranking of teams in each group was determined as follows (Regulations Article 12.7):\nEntrants.\nAll of CONCACAF's 41 member associations participated in the competition. The six teams which participated in the fifth round (hexagonal) of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification received automatic entry into League A. Of the remaining 35 teams, 34 entered into qualifying to determine which league they entered. The National Football Federation of Guatemala was suspended by FIFA in October 2016, and therefore Guatemala was ineligible to enter qualifying after missing the deadline of 1 March 2018. However, as the suspension was lifted by FIFA in May 2018, they automatically entered into League C of the group phase.\nSchedule.\nBelow was the schedule of the 2019–20 CONCACAF Nations League.\nThe Nations League Finals were originally scheduled for the international window from 23 to 31 March 2020. However, on 5 August 2019 CONCACAF announced that the tournament would instead be played in June 2020. The schedule for the tournament was announced on 9 March 2020, with the semi-finals on 4 June, and the third place play-off and final on 7 June 2020. On 3 April 2020, the tournament was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On 27 July 2020, CONCACAF announced that the tournament would be held in the international window from 22 to 30 March 2021. However, due to the postponement of the first round of CONCACAF World Cup qualifying, on 22 September 2020 CONCACAF announced that the final tournament would be held in June 2021.\nThe fixture list for the group phase was confirmed by CONCACAF on 21 May 2019.\nQualifying.\nThe draw for the qualifying fixtures was held on 7 March 2018 directly after the launch event of the CONCACAF Nations League. The 34 teams were seeded into four pots based on their position in the March 2018 CONCACAF Ranking Index. A computerized pre-draw produced a \"master schedule\", creating 17 fixtures for each matchday. The teams in each pot were then drawn to the corresponding positions in the schedule. The computer model assured that no teams would face each other more than once, and that each team would play two home and two away matches. Based on their results, the teams were divided into tiers for the main round of the inaugural edition of the CONCACAF Nations League. Moreover, the top ten teams qualified for the 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup to join the six hexagonal participants.\nSeeding.\nThe 41 CONCACAF members were allocated into pots of the league for which they qualified. Teams were seeded into pots based on their position in the November 2018 CONCACAF Ranking Index. League A had three pots of four teams, while League B had four pots of four teams. League C had three pots, with pots 1 and 2 featuring four teams each, and pot 3 featuring five teams.\nThe draw for the group phase took place at The Chelsea Theater in Paradise, Nevada, United States on 27 March 2019, 22:00 EDT (19:00 local time, PDT).\nLeague A.\nNations League Finals.\nBracket.\nAll times are local, MDT ()."

The event, split into half distance classic skiing and half distance skate skiing, was won by Simen Hegstad Krüger, for whom this was the first Olympic medal. There was a podium sweep for Norway with Martin Johnsrud Sundby and Hans Christer Holund winning silver and bronze medals, respectively.\nSummary.\nThe field included all the 2014 medalists: the defending champion Dario Cologna, the silver medalist Marcus Hellner, who was also the 2010 champion, and the bronze medalist Martin Johnsrud Sundby. Only Sundby returned to the podium.\nAt 20 km, a group of 15 skiers, which included all eventual medalists, was leading the race, about 20 seconds ahead of the rest of the field. About 5 km before the finish line, Krüger escaped and was not caught by the rest, winning the gold medal. From the chasing group, Sundby and Holund escaped less than 2 km before the finish. Eventually, Sundby was leading, and Holund did not catch him, winning bronze.\nQualification.\nA total of up to 310 cross-country skiers qualified across all eleven events. Athletes qualified for this event by having met the A qualification standard, which meant having 100 or less FIS Points in the distance classification. The Points list takes into average the best results of athletes per discipline during the qualification period (1 July 2016 to 21 January 2018). Countries received additional quotas by having athletes ranked in the top 30 of the FIS Olympics Points list (two per gender maximum, overall across all events). Countries also received an additional quota (one per gender maximum) if an athlete was ranked in the top 300 of the FIS Olympics Points list. After the distribution of B standard quotas, the remaining quotas were distributed using the Olympic FIS Points list, with each athlete only counting once for qualification purposes. A country could only enter a maximum of four athletes for the event.\nResults.\nThe race was started at 15:15."

        "text": "The Zimbabwe cricket team toured South Africa in December 2017 to play a four-day Test match as a day/night fixture which started on Boxing Day. Zimbabwe last played a Test match in South Africa in March 2005. Ahead of the Test match, there was also a three-day day/night match between Zimbabwe and a Cricket South Africa Invitation XI. The Test match finished inside two days, with South Africa winning by an innings and 120 runs.\nDespite being a four-day match, Cricket South Africa sought approval from the International Cricket Council (ICC) to grant the fixture Test match status. The ICC approved the request for Test status in October 2017 at their board meeting in Auckland. The trial of the four-day Test format by the ICC will run until the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Per the ICC's playing conditions, a minimum of 98 overs are to be bowled each day, with the follow-on set at a lead of 150 runs, instead of 200 runs in a five-day game. The last time a four-day Test match was played was in 1973, between New Zealand and Pakistan.\nSummary.\nSouth African cricketers Faf du Plessis and Dean Elgar expressed their concerns about a four-day Test match. Captain du Plessis said that \"I believe the great Test matches have gone to the last hour of the last day on day five\" and opening batsman Elgar said \"I don't think you should tinker with something that's not broken\". Zimbabwe's captain Graeme Cremer was more positive saying \"everyone is excited to be part of the historical Test match\".\nA day before the Test match, Faf du Plessis picked up a viral infection, putting him in doubt for the match. On the morning of the Test, he was ruled out of the fixture, with AB de Villiers replacing him as captain. De Villiers also kept wicket during the match, as South Africa's wicket-keeper Quinton de Kock suffered a hamstring injury while batting on day one.\nFollowing their victory in the Test, AB de Villiers said that \"the bowlers were exceptional on a very spicy wicket but we still needed to do the basics well\". Graeme Cremer said \"we knew it was going to be tough, but maybe not this tough\" before criticising Zimbabwe's first-class cricket, saying that the standards are nowhere near those of South Africa and Australia. Zimbabwe's coach Heath Streak also criticised the lack of Test cricket played by Zimbabwe saying that they need to play more than three or four matches a year.\nThe Test match became the second-shortest completed match, in terms of balls bowled, in the last fifty years, with 907 deliveries needed to finish the game. The previous shortest Test in the last fifty years, by balls bowled, was between Pakistan and Australia in October 2002, which was completed in 893 deliveries. The only Test played in South Africa to be completed in fewer deliveries was played in Cape Town in 1899, when England won the match in 796 balls. The last occurrence of a Test match being won in two days also featured South Africa and Zimbabwe, when South Africa won by an innings and 21 runs in Cape Town in March 2005. South Africa took all 20 wickets with 436 deliveries, the fewest balls bowled by them to do this in a Test. Their previous record was 440 deliveries against India in 1996, also a Boxing Day Test match."

        "title": "Mark Andrews (American football)",
        "text": "Mark Andrews (born September 6, 1995) is an American football tight end for the Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Oklahoma and was selected by the Ravens in the third round of the 2018 NFL draft. Andrews has been elected to the Pro Bowl three times and was named to the 2021 All-Pro Team after setting the Ravens' single-season record for receptions and receiving yards.\nEarly years.\nAndrews was born in Scottsdale, Arizona, to Paul and Martha Andrews. His father is a urologist and his mother works in real estate. He has two brothers and a sister.\nAndrews was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes when he was nine years old, but has been unhindered by the disease throughout his career.\nAndrews attended Desert Mountain High School in Scottsdale, Arizona. He played wide receiver in high school and had 68 receptions for 1,122 yards and 17 touchdowns as a senior, 81 receptions for 1,494 yards and 21 touchdowns as a junior and 58 receptions for 1,058 yards and 10 touchdowns as a sophomore. His quarterback in high school was Kyle Allen. He held the Arizona high school record for career receptions, before Kade Warner, the son of Kurt Warner, broke his record. Andrews committed to the University of Oklahoma to play college football.\nCollege career.\nAndrews switched from wide receiver to tight end at Oklahoma. After redshirting his first year in 2014, he played in all 13 games with one start in 2015 and had 19 receptions for 318 yards and seven touchdowns. In 2016, Andrews started 11 of 13 games, recording 31 receptions for 489 yards and seven touchdowns. He was the recipient of the 2017 John Mackey Award. In early January 2018, it was announced that Andrews would forgo his senior year at Oklahoma in favor of the 2018 NFL draft. Andrews finished his three years at Oklahoma with the sixth most touchdown receptions (22) by any receiver and had the most receiving yards (1,765) by a tight end.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn January 4, 2018, Andrews announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2018 NFL Draft. Andrews attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and completed all of the combine and positional drills. His overall performance was described as solid by scouts and analysts. On March 14, 2018, Andrews participated at Oklahoma's pro day, but chose to stand on his combine numbers and only performed positional drills. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Andrews was projected to be a second round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the fourth best tight end prospect in the draft by DraftScout.com, Scouts Inc., NFL analyst Mike Mayock, and \"Sports Illustrated\".\n2018.\nThe Baltimore Ravens selected Andrews in the third round (86th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Andrews was the fourth tight end drafted in 2018 and was the second tight end drafted by the Ravens, after Hayden Hurst (25th overall). On May 16, 2018, the Baltimore Ravens signed Andrews to a four-year, $3.45 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $836,660.\nThroughout training camp, Andrews competed to be a starting tight end against Hayden Hurst, Nick Boyle, and Maxx Williams. Head coach John Harbaugh named Andrews the fourth tight end to start the regular season, behind Hurst, Williams, and Boyle.\nIn the season opener against the Buffalo Bills, Andrews made his NFL debut and had three receptions for 31 yards in the 47–3 victory. On September 13, Andrews scored his first-career touchdown in the 23–34 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals.\nAndrews closed out the 2018 regular season with 34 receptions for 552 yards and three touchdowns. He was responsible for two of the Ravens longest passing plays that season. The first was a 74-yard catch-and-run against the Oakland Raiders on November 25 and the second was a 68-yard touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers on December 22. He led all rookie tight ends in receiving yards and finished third in receptions.\n2019.\nIn Week 1 against the Miami Dolphins, Andrews had eight catches for 108 yards and one touchdown as the Ravens won 59–10. In Week 2 against the Arizona Cardinals, Andrews caught eight passes for 112 yards and one touchdown as the Ravens won 23–17. In Week 16 against the Cleveland Browns, Andrews caught six passes for 93 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–15 win. Overall, Andrews finished the 2019 season with 64 receptions for 852 receiving yards and ten receiving touchdowns. His ten receiving touchdowns led the league among tight ends and tied with Cooper Kupp for second in the league among all positions. He was named to his first Pro Bowl for his efforts in the 2019 season.\n2020.\nAndrews started the 2020 season off with five catches for 58 yards and two receiving touchdowns in the Ravens' 38–6 victory over the Browns. In Week 3 against the Kansas City Chiefs, Andrews caught three of his eight targets and dropped a potential touchdown pass in the end zone during the 20–34 loss. Andrews rebounded in the following week’s game against the Washington Football Team, catching three passes for 57 yards and two touchdowns during the 31–17 win. In Week 11 against the Tennessee Titans, Andrews recorded five catches for 96 yards and a touchdown during the 24–30 overtime loss. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on November 30, 2020, and activated on December 9. Andrews finished the 2020 season with 58 receptions for 701 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns.\n2021.\nOn September 6, 2021, the Ravens signed Andrews to a four-year, $56 million extension including $37.6 million guaranteed. In Week 3 against the Detroit Lions, Andrews had five receptions for 109 yards in a 19–17 comeback win. It was Andrews' first 100-yard game since Week 2 of the 2019 season. In Week 5 against the Indianapolis Colts, Andrews caught 11 of 13 targets for 147 yards and two touchdowns as well as two two-point conversion receptions (all career-highs), helping the Ravens to rally and win in overtime 31–25. Later that season, Andrews recorded three straight 100-yard receiving games between Weeks 14–16. In Week 14, Andrews recorded 11 receptions (tying his career-high from earlier in the season) for 115 yards and a touchdown in a 22–24 loss to the Browns. The next week, he had 10 receptions for 136 yards and two touchdowns in a 30–31 loss to the Green Bay Packers. In Week 16, he had eight receptions for 125 yards and a touchdown in 21–41 loss to the Bengals.\nAndrews would go on to finish the season setting a career high in receptions (107) and receiving yards (1,361) to go along with 9 receiving touchdowns in 17 games played. At the end of the season, Andrews was voted into his second Pro Bowl and was named First-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. He was ranked 32nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.\n2022.\nAndrews entered the 2022 season as a full-time starter for the first time in his career. In a Week 2 38–42 loss to the Dolphins, he had his first 100-yard receiving game of the season with nine receptions for 104 yards and a touchdown along with a three yard rush. The next week against the New England Patriots, he had eight receptions for 89 yards and two touchdowns in the 37–26 win. Andrews recorded his second 100-yard performance in a Week 6 20–24 loss to the New York Giants, finishing the game with seven receptions for 106 yards and a touchdown. He finished the 2022 season with 73 receptions for 847 receiving yards and five receiving touchdowns in 15 games and starts.\n2023.\nAndrews entered the season as inactive with a quad injury, sitting out Week 1 against the Houston Texans. On November 16, during a Week 11 game against the Bengals, Andrews injured his ankle during the first quarter after being tackled by Bengals' linebacker Logan Wilson. Andrews was brought back to the locker room for further evaluation. After the game, it was announced he had suffered a cracked fibula and an ankle ligament injury, sidelining him for the rest of the regular season. Andrews underwent ankle surgery on November 21, and was placed on the injured reserve on November 25. Andrews was activated off of injured reserve on January 26, 2024 ahead of the against the Kansas City Chiefs.\nPersonal life.\nBecause of his Type 1 diabetes, Andrews wears an insulin pump, except when he plays football. He serves as a spokesperson for those with diabetes and speaks with young people about its effects and ways to live with diabetes.\nHis brother Jack is a urologist, his sister Annie is a dentist, and his other brother, Charlie, works in real estate."

        "title": "Nutrient cycling in the Columbia River Basin",
        "text": "Nutrient cycling in the Columbia River Basin involves the transport of nutrients through the system, as well as transformations from among dissolved, solid, and gaseous phases, depending on the element. The elements that constitute important nutrient cycles include macronutrients such as nitrogen (as ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate), silicate, phosphorus, and micronutrients, which are found in trace amounts, such as iron. Their cycling within a system is controlled by many biological, chemical, and physical processes.\nThe Columbia River Basin is the largest freshwater system of the Pacific Northwest, and due to its complexity, size, and modification by humans, nutrient cycling within the system is affected by many different components. Both natural and anthropogenic processes are involved in the cycling of nutrients. Natural processes in the system include estuarine mixing of fresh and ocean waters, and climate variability patterns such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (both climatic cycles that affect the amount of regional snowpack and river discharge). Natural sources of nutrients in the Columbia River include weathering, leaf litter, salmon carcasses, runoff from its tributaries, and ocean estuary exchange. Major anthropogenic impacts to nutrients in the basin are due to fertilizers from agriculture, sewage systems, logging, and the construction of dams.\nNutrients dynamics vary in the river basin from the headwaters to the main river and dams, to finally reaching the Columbia River estuary and ocean. Upstream in the headwaters, salmon runs are the main source of nutrients. Dams along the river impact nutrient cycling by increasing residence time of nutrients, and reducing the transport of silicate to the estuary, which directly impacts diatoms, a type of phytoplankton. The dams are also a barrier to salmon migration, and can increase the amount of methane locally produced. The Columbia River estuary exports high rates of nutrients into the Pacific Ocean; with the exception of nitrogen, which is delivered into the estuary by ocean upwelling sources.\nDescription.\nThe Columbia River basin is a major watershed and the largest river in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Extending from southern British Columbia to northern Nevada, the watershed includes seven American states and two Canadian provinces and drains an area of about 260,000 square miles. The Columbia River stretches 1,620 miles in length until its discharge into the Pacific Ocean near Astoria, Oregon. The average annual discharge rate of the Columbia River changes due to climate and land-use variability, but generally ranges from 120,000 to 260,000 cubic feet per second. Finally, the population of the Columbia River Basin within the United States is about 4.6 million people (per the 2000 census).\nThe water cycle in the Columbia River is dependent on the relation between water flow and topography in the basin. Within the United States, only the Missouri-Mississippi River system has annual runoff greater than that of the Columbia River. The amount of water that the river carries each year is determined by the precipitation, sunlight, and air temperature in the basin, which varies from year to year. West of the Cascade Range, most of the winter precipitation falls as rain, but in the Cascade Mountains and eastward, precipitation through winter is snow. Snowmelt in the mountains begins to reach the river during early to mid-spring. About 30 percent of the streamflow in the Columbia River occurs between January and March (primarily from rainfall) and about 30 percent occurs between April and June (from a combination of rainfall and snowmelt).\nNatural processes.\nCoastal upwelling, river discharge, tidal mixing, estuarine circulation, climate oscillation, and remineralization, are sources or sinks for the Columbia River basin nutrient budget. Due to these transport processes the Columbia River Estuary provides large nutrient sources to the adjacent sub-arctic Northeast Pacific coastal surface water.\nNitrogen is added to rivers through many natural processes, such as the decomposition of leaf litter and organic matter. Nitrogen gas is the most abundant molecule in earth's atmosphere, comprising about 78 percent of the total composition of air, however not typically a large source of nitrogen to the river. This form of nitrogen, dinitrogen gas (&lt;chem&gt;N2&lt;/chem&gt;), is inert and biologically unavailable to most living organisms. However, some bacteria and archaea can utilize nitrogen fixation to convert dinitrogen into ammonia or other compounds accessible to organisms.\nFinally, nitrogen load at the Columbia River mouth is about 2-20 times larger than that at the Canadian border. This gradient in nitrogen distribution is partly a result of the inputs of the Columbia's major tributaries, the Snake River and the Willamette River. The Snake and Willamette rivers together contribute about 50-80 percent of the nitrogen load in a given year, coming from activities within those respective watersheds.\nWeathering and runoff.\nWeathering is the breakdown of rocks, soil, and minerals through contact with water, the atmosphere, and biological organisms, converting solid phase minerals to dissolved phase compounds. This process can introduce nutrients, most notably phosphorus, into the Columbia watershed. Both chemical and physical weathering occur, usually together, and this coupling tends to accelerate the other. Precipitation varies across the basin, influencing the amount of weathering and subsequent runoff that transports this material into the basin.\nOrganic matter such as leaves may also naturally fall into the waterways through runoff. Over time, this material is respired, releasing assimilated nutrients into the environment.\nSalmon impacts on nutrient cycling.\nAn important source of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, for rivers in the Pacific Northwest is the spawning of salmon and subsequent death and decomposition of fish up-river. Every fall, ocean salmon at the end of their life cycle swim upriver to spawn before they die. The remineralization of their organic matter releases significant nitrogen loads into the river, although recent decades have observed decreased salmon runs and subsequently less impact on the total nitrogen budget.\nSalmon are an anadromous family of fish that rear in freshwater, migrate to the ocean as juveniles, and then return to the freshwater as adults to lay their eggs and die in what is called a salmon run. Their death and subsequent decomposition releases substantial amounts of nitrogen and lower amounts of phosphorus into the system, boosting the productivity of local headwaters and serving as a vector of material transport across the ocean to watershed interface. Studies have estimated salmon in some parts of the Columbia river contribute up to 60 percent of nitrogen to other trophic levels.\nThe regional ubiquity of salmon as a recreational and commercial fishery has led to increased attention on local populations within the Columbia River system. Annual salmon harvests are among the highest-earners of the Pacific Northwest fishery economy; in the lower Columbia River specifically, salmon account for over 84 percent of commercial fish landings.\nWhile areas accessible to salmon have been reduced over the past century through the construction of dams and the modification of river channels, this group of fish historically inhabited almost 13,000 miles of the Columbia River basin.  Efforts from fishery management and state agencies, as well as the listing of several resident salmon stocks under the protection of the Endangered Species Act, has led to the re-establishment of accessibility to some parts of the Columbia River system for salmon. The regional return of salmon runs restores an important segment of local nutrient cycles, particularly that of nitrogen and phosphorus, to the system.\nEstuarine and ocean exchange.\nThe Columbia River Estuary is the most downstream portion of the river that experiences ocean tides, generally defined as the furthest reach of the Columbia River plume to the Bonneville Dam. Here, a transition zone occurs where freshwater discharge from the river meets and mixes with Pacific Ocean saltwater. In this region, physical processes that affect nutrients are the circulation (entrance/exit, movement) of specific water masses with their nutrient load, the magnitude of tidal flow distributing ocean waters inland, and bottom sediment exchange affecting nutrient particle mobility.\nWith the exception of nitrogen, the Columbia River estuary nutrient budget tends to be dominated by nutrient transport out of the system. During periods of high river flow, generally April to June, the estuary has a daily average residence time of less than a day. Meanwhile, at times of lowest river discharge, typically September to October, this turnover time lengthens to about three days. The turnover time can also vary due to the tidal cycle, and affect the amount of oceanic exchange in the estuary; on the whole the residence time is fairly short. Through a more rapid transit time of waters within the river, local primary production tends to be lower as autotrophic communities are quickly flushed out of the system. Since there is less subsequent biological uptake of nutrients, there is a high rate of nutrient transport out of the Columbia River and into coastal waters.\nThe upwelled waters of the Pacific Ocean have very high concentrations of dissolved nutrients due to the history of biological respiration that has occurred throughout the water masses' time in circulation through the deep ocean. Biological respiration is the consumption of organic matter and concurrent release of nutrients contained in that biomass. This process is an important source for nutrients that other organisms require. Examples of these organisms include phytoplankton and algae, whose communities are often limited in growth by the availability of specific nutrients, most commonly nitrogen which is the primary limiting nutrient the Columbia River. In addition, to nitrogen, iron, and silicate cycling in the estuary can impact local and coastal ocean phytoplankton communities.\nNitrate.\nDue to coastal upwelling, ocean sources of nitrate (an oxidized form of nitrogen) exceed river sources by a magnitude of roughly 3 to 1, and is a primary source of nitrogen for the Columbia River Estuary. This is evident within the estuary by the positively correlated relationship of nitrate availability and salinity, the latter an identifying characteristic of highly saline marine waters. As a result of differences in delivery to the system, nitrate is the primary limiting nutrient in the estuary. Consequently, during seasonal periods of downwelling when less ocean water is mixed into the estuary, local nitrate concentrations may be very low. Thus, nutrient cycling and primary production in the estuary are heavily linked with the seasonal winds off the Oregon and Washington coasts that control local ocean upwelling and downwelling.\nPhosphate.\nAlthough phosphorus is of interest in the mid-river, especially in and around reservoirs throughout the Columbia River Basin as discussed below, it is not typically a limiting nutrient for biological communities within the estuary. As a result, there is little available literature on phosphate cycling within the estuary. \nIron.\nThe primary source of iron into the estuary is from geologic rock weathering and subsequent runoff delivery to the system. In addition, some iron may come from the Pacific Ocean and is transported into the estuary during tidal oscillation, enhanced seasonally during periods of upwelling. Iron inputs derived from riverine and oceanic origins are typically on the magnitude of 14-30 nM and 6 nM in concentration respectively. These sources of iron are generally sufficient to meet biological demands, including those of primary production, in the estuary and upriver. Consequently, iron is commonly not the limiting nutrient in the system; rather, the river depending on season and flow may serve as a net source of iron to iron-deficient coastal regions of the Northeast Pacific, sometimes referred to as areas of High Nutrient, Low Chlorophyll.\nSilicate.\nAs discussed in more detail below, dams can cause large scale hydrological changes by forming reservoirs. These reservoirs can act as nutrient traps altering nutrient ratios and reducing silicate transport through rivers and into the estuary. Since mid twentieth-century dam construction on the Columbia river, seasonal silicate transport out of the Columbia River Estuary has shifted in magnitude since the historical, pre-alteration of the river hydrology.\nOutside the estuary, the Columbia river is a source of silicate for the sub-arctic Northeast Pacific coast. Silicate is a required nutrient for diatoms, which form siliceous shells, within the surface waters of this coastal region. The observed shift in silicate transport out of the Columbia River estuary since 1970 has resulted in the development of seasonal silicate limited regions of diatom production in coastal waters near the estuary.\nPDO and ENSO.\nNutrient dynamics are also affected on a long-term scale by human and climate influences. Specifically, the Columbia River discharge rates, which govern bulk nutrient transport, follow Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This is because of how these oscillations affect regional air temperature, precipitation patterns, and off shore wind, which in turn affect annual snowpack, sea surface temperatures, and upwelling and downwelling trends. Changes in these trends can alter the magnitude of runoff from land incorporated into the Columbia River system as well as coastal ocean inflow, which ultimately alter nutrient loading by either bringing in additional nutrients or washing them out.\nResearch indicates dam construction on the river has affected the strength of PDO and ENSO's influence through alteration of runoff residence times, but to date these effects have not been well described. Since 1858, total silicate transport has decreased by 50 percent, with 10 percent of that decrease directly linked to these climate oscillations. This alteration of net nutrient transport is critical to determining nutrient distribution and availability throughout the basin. Silicate, for example, may direct nutrient cycling by altering environmental parameters implicated in primary production by organisms, including river depth, flood frequency, and turbidity.\nGreening of the estuary.\nIt has been observed that the Columbia River estuary is \"greening\". \"Greening\" of the estuary describes the movement of phytoplankton blooms that historically occurred outside the mouth of the river, and are now blooming much more frequently inside the estuary, effectively \"greening\" the river surface with colored microscopic organisms.\nPrimary production in this region is often dominated by diatom species such as \"Skeletomema costatum, Chaetoceros\" spp. and \"Thalassiosira\" spp. which bloom seasonally in spring and summer. Large blooms of these species consume the available nitrogen in the region, eventually hindering the furthering blooming by creating a nitrate-limited growth period. Exacerbating this nitrogen depletion, high estuarine turnover times in the Columbia River Estuary displace these diatoms communities out into the ocean. This export reduces rates of nitrogen remineralization as the available nitrogen consumed by the diatom blooms is removed from the estuary system.\nThe nitrogen-deplete conditions created by these blooms are improved as natural and anthroprogenic macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients are transported into the system by river discharge. The spring-summer seasonality of these diatom blooms is affected by climate, variable with both Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices, and human influences such as dam construction in the watershed. As discussed previously, both climate oscillation and human interaction in the Columbia watershed have been shown decrease transport of nutrients into the estuary.\nAs an example of human impacts on this system, the increased footprint of water reservoirs caused by damning of the Columbia River has resulted in a standing pools of nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus. These nutrients mostly stay within the watershed during winter months instead of discharging to the ocean, as river discharge rates are controlled by dam release schedules. As a result, these nutrients and organic matter are locally biochemically processed by plankton communities, increasing the biomass of life within the system, and resulting in high nutrient releases in spring and summer months when dam flow through is increased. As a result, this anthroprogenic discharge cycle contributes to the seasonality of diatom blooms in the estuary.\nUnlike other large estuaries, such as the Chesapeake Bay Estuary, the Columbia River supplies little nitrate to the estuary relative to the overall local nitrogen budget. Rather, the primary source of nitrate into the estuary is from ocean exchange caused by wind-driven seasonal upwelling off the Oregon and Washington coasts. This influx of nitrate, generally the primary limiting nutrient to biological communities in the estuary, is an important driver of primary productivity in estuarine plumes of river discharge. Moreover, large scale upwelling on the Oregon-Washington coast typically occurs in spring and summer, and as discussed previously, is coupled with the PDO and ENSO, this seasonal upwelling further contributes to diatom bloom in the estuary. Finally, without this source of nitrogen through upwelling, the estuary quickly becomes nitrate limited and hinders further facilitation of biological activity.\nRed blooms.\nRed blooms, a type of plankton bloom with a characteristic scarlet pigment, occur every year in the Columbia River estuary, lasting several months during late summer to early fall. The marine ciliate \"Myrionecta rubra\" is responsible for this annual discoloration. Research has found that while not toxic, dense blooms of \"M. rubra\" can impact estuaries, fjords, and upwelling areas and have been associated with high rates of local primary production.\n\"M. rubra\" gets its red color from consuming cryptophytes, or algae, that contain a red pigment called phycoerythrin in their chloroplasts.  In the Columbia River estuary, \"M. rubra\" commonly preys on the cryptophyte \"Teleaulax amphioxeia.\" From its prey, \"M. rubra\" also acquires specialty cellular organs in order to photosynthesize and effectively absorbs these compounds into its own body. This process is referred to as \"acquired phototrophy\", and for \"M. rubra\" includes the assimilation of chloroplasts, nuclei, and mitochondria During the day, the ciliates stay near the surface of the water to photosynthesize, which is how the red blooms are easily observed.\nOne question of interest associated with \"M. rubra\" is its ability to spread within the Columbia River estuary in spite of the short residence time of the water. The red blooms have been observed initiating near the river mouth, then establishing throughout the entire lower estuary. \"M. rubra\" is quite motile and can swim (1.2 cm / second) and jump (as much as 160 µm in 20 milliseconds), which could explain how they are able to stay within the estuary for months at a time.  \nThe blooms have a dramatic impact on the local ecosystem and nutrient levels. Globally, studies have shown that \"M. rubra\" blooms are associated with higher levels of bacteria, dissolved organic nutrients, oxygen saturation, particulate organic carbon and nitrogen. Specifically in the Columbia River estuary, red blooms correspond with increased secondary production by microbes and decreased ammonium, nitrate, and dissolved organic carbon levels. A further study in the Columbia River estuary found that high concentrations of organic nutrients and low amounts of inorganic nitrogen were associated with the red waters. \"M. rubra\" blooms also created areas characterized by high primary production and increased levels of particulate organic matter during this period, thus shifting the trophic status in red water areas from net heterotrophy towards autotrophy, making \"M. rubra\"'s red blooms a seasonal biogeochemical hotspot of the Columbia River estuary.\nAnthropogenic impacts on processes.\nNutrient cycling is affected by human alteration referred to as anthropogenic impacts. The Columbia River Basin is home to nearly five million residents, and the rapid alteration of land in the past several centuries has shifted many aspects of nutrient dynamics within this environment. Human processes such as construction (such as for dams), logging, and mining can impact sediment transport, resulting in decreased accumulation and/or the enhancement or removal of nutrients. The cycling of nutrients within the Columbia River Basin is also affected by differences in land-use through variability in human development and vegetation. Land use of the basin within the United States is primarily forested (87 percent), with 11 percent of land used for agriculture, and 2 percent for urban areas.\nAgriculture.\nHuman-related activity has contributed over 50 percent of the available global reactive nitrogen. The Haber-Bosch process is an artificial means of nitrogen fixation, producing over 450 million tons of ammonia per year. Much of this yield is used for agricultural purposes through fertilizers. Agricultural sources of nitrogen reach rivers primarily through the erosion of soil sediments, but also through airborne dust and gaseous transport of volatilized NH3 from livestock manure and fertilizers.\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, agriculture began to exceed mining and became the Columbia River Basin's primary economic industry. The Columbia River has been subject to cultural eutrophication in part due to the use of the river and its tributaries to irrigate over seven million acres of farmland, an extraction that comprises an average of 93 percent of daily water use in the basin. Natural run-off caused by precipitation and snowpack melt across agricultural lands further transports more of these nutrients into the river. In the late 1990s, the nitrogen load in the Columbia river was over twice the concentration historically observed.\nLogging.\nForests are important terrestrial sinks for nutrients due to the ability of vegetation to sequester excess nutrients into their biomass. Additionally, plant roots stabilize soils and consequently prevent a large portion of the nutrient pool to be transferred via runoff into rivers and other waterways. Studies of nearby Pacific Northwest forests have found that logged forests lose 1.6 to 3 times the amount of nutrients over several years times compared to undisturbed areas. By 1992, 35 percent of the total harvestable forest in the Columbia River Basin had been logged. Consequently, though direct quantification of these processes within the Columbia River watershed have not yet occurred, the ubiquitous changes in land-use by the logging industry have changed the delivery of nutrients into the system.\nSewage and septic inputs.\nA significant nutrient source from developed areas into aquatic ecosystems is through sewage and septic systems. Municipal waste, high in nitrogen and phosphorus, is sometimes treated by wastewater facilities or through soil filtration, but often some excess nutrients leak and contribute to eutrophication. Human sewage waste in the United States accounts for about 12 percent of average annual nitrogen input into rivers. Often, there are many small-scale sources of this discharge and no one input is clearly dominating nutrient loading. However, occasionally unexpected events, usually through sewer systems or at wastewater plants, occur that result in a significant singular emission. In the fall of 2017 for example, a power failure at a treatment facility in Vancouver, Washington led to the discharge of over 510,000 gallons of wholly untreated and partially treatment effluent. The continuing background discharge along with larger-scale, periodic emission events comprise a large input of human-derived nutrient loading.\nEffects of dams.\nBeginning in the 1930s with the construction of the Bonneville and Grand Coulee dams, the Columbia River has experienced significant modification to its flow. Today, the US Army Corps of Engineers recognize over 250 reservoirs, 150 hydroelectric projects, and 18 mainstem dams on the Columbia and its main tributary, the Snake River. Dams have been shown to directly impact nutrient cycling within the Columbia river basin through the formation of reservoirs which dramatically alter river hydrology and discharge rates and as a result constitute a major anthroprogenic impact on nutrient cycling in the river. Due to its size and the large number of dams within the basin, the Columbia River basin is often used as representative case study on how dams an impact nutrient cycling of watersheds in general. Notably, dam construction in the Columbia River Basin has impacted relative nutrient ratios, methane production, and salmon migration. \nTo provide context for the scale of change that dams can effect, the construction of the Bonneville dam in the late 1930s completely submerged the Cascades Rapids, permanently changing the local river hydrology and subsequently altering local nutrient transport and processes in the region. The restriction of flow as well as the creation of standing water upriver of the dams have been linked to deleterious effects on nutrient cycling in similar ecosystems, such as the Murray River Basin in Australia and the Danube River Basin in Europe, through processes such as the alteration of particle residence times and nutrient loading. \nNutrient ratios.\nMacronutrients, such as phosphorus, nitrogen, and silicate are strongly impacted by increased residence times in reservoirs created by dam construction throughout the Columbia River Basin. Exact nutrient retention rates can vary between 16 and 98 percent depending on local hydrology, reservoir design, and location in the basin. However, this increase in nutrient retention rates in the Columbia River basin has generally modified the relative ratios of available nutrients from their natural state, which has subsequently altered the efficiency of compound usage by primary producers such as diatoms.\nDiatoms are directly affected by the hydrodynamic changes that reservoirs create. The slow moving, fresh water in reservoirs facilitates high settling rates for siliceous diatom shells, which can both bloom in the reservoir or be carried into the river from upstream. Diatom shells are negatively buoyant and have a natural tenancy to settle, this coupled with the reduced forward momentum of standing water in a reservoir, and the physical barrier a dam increase the settling rate of diatom shells within the reservoir. This high settling rate, coupled with slow dissolution of silicate in freshwater, leads to a net decrease in silicate recycling and reduced silicate transport through the Columbia River Basin and export out of the estuary resulting in a net decrease in the overall silicate budget.\nThese same hydrodynamic changes also result in a net increase in phosphorus and nitrogen recycling in reservoirs. Settling rates for algae, other than diatoms, are slow. Slow settling rates allow for algae to remain in the water column longer, allowing for increased release for organically bound phosphorus and nitrogen into the water column through remineralization.\nThe combine impact of increased silicate retention and increased remineralization of phosphorus and nitrogen can result in high N/Si and P/Si ratios within and below reservoirs; these increased rations can be further compounded by increase nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations from eutrophication. The high N/Si and P/Si rations caused by these processes can be harmful to the local ecosystem in the basin; for example, N/Si ratios greater than 1 can result in excess nitrogen relative to diatom requirements, this can promote the growth of other phytoplankton species, negatively affecting diatom communities.\nThis impact of reservoirs on the transport and recycling of silicate, phosphorus, and nitrogen, is not unique to the Columbia River Basin, but has had a measurable impact on the export of these nutrients through the basin and out of the estuary. As discussed in context with the PDO and ENSO, since 1858, total silicate export out of the Columbia river basin through the estuary has decreased over 50 percent with about 40 percent of that reduction liked directly to dam construction. Finally, as discussed above, these changed in nutrient ratios have largely contributed to the greening of the Columbia river estuary.\nMethane.\nReservoirs often serve as a catchment basin for organic matter such as vegetation, and waste transferred into the river via rainwater runoff. Initially, this organic matter provides a nutrient source; however, as it continues to accumulate and begins to decompose, the respiration of this organic matter can quickly deplete oxygen levels leading to anoxia. Under anoxic conditions, the large amount of organic matter are further broken down through anaerobic respiration and methanogenesis into carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4). These decomposition processes can occur rapidly after flooding, when large amount of fresh organic matter are transported into the river, and as a result methane and carbon dioxide release can be large.\nAnaerobic respiration, which occurs in the absence of highly oxidizing molecular oxygen, utilizes less-oxidized electron acceptors such as nitrate (NO3−). As a result, high levels of anaerobic respiration can result in denitrification. This process of denitrification removes nitrogen from the Columbia River Basin, by converting available nitrogen, important for primary production, from its usable dissolved forms (i.e. NO3− and NO2−) to its gaseous form (N2).\nSalmon migration.\nDams provide a barrier for migrating fish such as salmon, limiting their abilities to swim upstream. As discussed above, studies in the Pacific Northwest and Scandinavia have demonstrated that migratory fish can provide 30 percent or more of the phosphorus input to oligotrophic lakes. These rates of phosphorus fertilization, as well as similarly high rates of nitrogen fertilization, come from the decomposition of adult carcasses after mating and can be significantly affected by reduced migration caused by dam construction. Research estimates as much as 7 to 15 percent of the migrating salmon stock perish as they cross each consecutive dam. Lower rates of successful salmon migration redistribute the remineralization of nitrogen and phosphorus by reducing nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization upstream of dams, as a result there is a successive reduction in nutrients upstream of each consecutive dam. The redistribution of nutrients in the Columbia River Basin is currently a popular area of research; however, additional data is needed to determine the lasting implications of these changes.\nWater quality.\nThe complexity of nutrient cycles is an enduring challenge to understanding ecosystem function. Particularly, in areas of significant habitation and modification by humans, these systems are experiencing rapid periods of alteration from historical precedents within the Columbia river Basin. These shifts in human habitation and impact have further complicated and obscured insights into the behavior of nutrient cycling. As the dominant water system in the Pacific Northwest and the home to nearly five million people, the Columbia River Basin integrates these numerous natural and anthropogenic biogeochemical processes. Consequently, the watershed is a foundational environmental resource, providing the region with many goods and services including jobs, natural materials (timber, fresh water), and recreation at a capital worth recently estimated to be $198 billion annually. However, the efficacy and ability of the system to provide these assets largely hinges upon the function of such essential ecosystem components like nutrient cycling. Perturbations to nutrient cycling may result in deleterious effects to both the environment and to resident human populations, possibly through the emergence of toxic plankton blooms, decreased aesthetic value, dissolved oxygen depletion, and reduced fish stocks. Ultimately, the sustainability of the Columbia River Basin ecosystem and its impact on residents are firmly connected by the function of nutrient cycles."

He was active from 1928 to 1953.\nCareer.\nBowden played his first tournament in 1928 at the British Columbia Championships. In 1930 he won his first singles title at the Yonkers City Championships. Bowden made his debut in the U. S. championships in 1930 and lost in round two. At the 1931 U.S. Championships, Bowden caused the \"biggest upset of the year\" by beating Wimbledon champion Sidney Wood in the third round. According to Bill Tilden \"Sidney allowed himself to be drawn in. He had to come in because Bowden was shortening up. And once Sidney came up, he left himself wide open for that shot down the sideline or a smart rap across court\". Wood admitted afterwards \"I was afraid to go to the net\". Bowden lost in the quarterfinals to Fred Perry. Bowden continued to play in the U. S. championships until 1947, reaching the last 16 in 1935 and 1940. Bowden was three times a finalist in the national indoor championships (losing the 1937 final to Frank Parker, the 1938 final to Don McNeill and the 1939 final to Wayne Sabin). Bowden won his final singles title in 1940 at the Englewood Invitation tournament held at the Field Club, Englewood, New Jersey. He played his final tournament at the U.S. International Indoor Championships in 1953.\nAfter serving as a 2nd lieutenant in the US Army in WW2, in Papua New Guinea, and Philippines, he worked as a statistician for the New York Telephone Company.\nStyle of play.\nAllison Danzig of The New York Times described Bowden's playing style \"His service was a veritable lightning bolt and if the ball came back, he was up to the net to smother the return with his volleys and kills. His hard forehand and sweeping backhand kept the ball deep to crowd his opponent in the corners and pave the way for successful forages at close quarters\"."

        "title": "Fire and carbon cycling in boreal forests",
        "text": "Terrestrial ecosystems found in the boreal (or taiga) regions of North America and Eurasia cover 17% of the Earth's land surface, and contain more than 30% of all carbon present in the terrestrial biome. In terms of carbon storage, the boreal region consists of three ecosystems: boreal forest, peatland, and tundra. Vast areas of the globe and are contributing greatly to atmospheric carbon release due to increased temperature and fire hazard. High northern latitudes will experience the most significant increase in warming on the planet as a result of increased atmospheric greenhouse gases thus placing in jeopardy the carbon sink in these areas. In addition to the release of carbon through the melting of permafrost, high intensity wildfires will become more common and thus contribute to the release of stored carbon. This means that the boreal forest and its fire regime is becoming an increasingly more significant factor in determining the global carbon budget. \nBoreal forests are also important economic factors in Russia and Canada specifically, and the uncertainty of fire patterns in the future as a result of climate change is a major consideration in forest management plans. A decrease in allowed timber harvest could be a solution to long term uncertainty of fire cycles. \nCarbon cycling in boreal forests.\nAlthough temperate and tropical forests in total cover twice as much land as boreal forest, boreal forest contains 20% more carbon than the other two combined. Boreal forests are susceptible to global warming because the ice/snow–albedo feedback is significantly influenced by surface temperature, so fire induced changes in surface albedo and infrared emissivity are more significant than in the tropics. \nBoreal forest fires contribute greatly to greenhouse gas presence in the atmosphere. Large boreal fires produce enough energy to produce convective smoke columns that can break into the troposphere and occasionally penetrate across the tropopause. In addition, the cold temperature in boreal regions result in low levels of water vapor. This low level of water vapor combined with low solar radiation results in very low photochemical production of the OH radical, which is a chemical that controls the atmospheric lifetime of most tropospheric gases. Therefore, the greenhouse gas emission in boreal forest fires will have prolonged lifetimes over the forest. \nFire regime.\nThe fire regimes of boreal forest in Canada and in Russia are distinct. In Russia, the climate is drier and the majority of fires are human caused. This means that there are more frequent fires of lower intensity than in Canada and that most carbon output as a result of fire is in Russia. Forestry practices in Russia involve the use of heavy machinery and large-scale clear-cuts, leading to the alteration of fuel complexes. This practice is reportedly causing areas to degrade into grass steppes, rather that regenerate as new forest. This may result in the shorting of fire return intervals. Industrial practices in Russia also create additional fire hazards (severe damages in the Russian Federation affect about 9 million ha). Radioactive contamination on an area of about 7 million ha creates a fire hazard because fire can redistribute radionuclides.\nThe majority of boreal forest fires in Canada are started by lightning. Subsequently, there are fewer fires on average in Canada but a much higher frequency of high intensity crown fire than Russia with a crown fire rate of 57% in Canada as opposed to 6% in Russia. Natural fire rotation across Canadian and Alaskan boreal forests is one to several centuries. \nPeatland and tundra.\nFire indirectly plays a role in the exchange of carbon between terrestrial surface and the atmosphere by regulating soil and moisture regimes, including plant succession, photosynthesis, and soil microbial processes. Soil in boreal regions is a significant global carbon sink; boreal forest soil holds 200 Gt of carbon while boreal peatlands hold 400 Gt of carbon. Northernmost permafrost regions contain 10,355 ± 150 Pg of soil organic carbon (SOC) in the top 0-3 m and 21% of this carbon is in the soil organic layer (SOL) pool found in the top 30 cm of the ground layer. \nThe depth of the organic soil layer is one of the controls on permafrost, leading to a generalization of two domains in boreal forest: thick soil layer and thin soil layer. Thick organic soil insulates the subsoil from warmer summer temperatures and allows for permafrost to develop. Although permafrost keeps ground moist during winter, during summer months upper organic soil horizons will become desiccated. As average temperatures increase, Permafrost is melting at a faster rate and, correspondingly, the length of the fire season is increasing. When the fire-free interval (FFI) is decreased, the loss of the SOL may result in a domain change to a thin soil layer, leading to less carbon storage in the soil, greater fire vulnerability, and decreased permafrost. In black spruce forests, decreased FFI can ruin successional trajectories by opening the door for deciduous trees and shrubs to invade, which also further increases fire vulnerability.\nData regarding carbon storage in the permafrost region as well as fire activity in boreal forests is sparse, which is a significant barrier in determining an accurate carbon budget. An expert assessment indicates that the permafrost region will become a net carbon source by 2100.\nA 5 - 10 degree C rise in forest floor temperature after a fire will significantly increase the rate of decomposition for years after the fire occurs, which temporarily turns the soil into a net carbon source (not sink) locally. \nFire enhances the biogenic emissions of NO and N20 from soil."

        "text": "The Staffordshire Rugby Union is the governing body for the sport of rugby union in the county of Staffordshire in England. The union is the constituent body of the Rugby Football Union (RFU) for Staffordshire, and administers and organises rugby union clubs and competitions in the county. It also administers the Staffordshire county rugby representative teams.\nHistory.\nAlthough there had been a number of long established clubs such as Burton (founded in 1870), Lichfield (1874) and Wolverhampton (1875), it took until 1923 for the Staffordshire Rugby Union to be formed, when it was part of the North Midlands Rugby Football Union. As the county started to find its identity in the 1920s more sides would start to form, with clubs such as Walsall (1921) and Stafford (1925) coming into existence during this period.\nDespite its formation in 1923, Staffordshire would not be recognised as a constituent body by the RFU until the 1960s. In 1961 a representative side defeated the reigning county champions Cheshire in a friendly match. This result showed the RFU that Staffordshire were ready to be included in the County Championships and the following year they would take part for the first time, being finally awarded constituent body status in 1962. On 14 March 1970, Staffordshire won the County Championship when they upset favourites Gloucestershire 11–9 in the final played at Peel Croft in Burton upon Trent.\nSince the glory days of 1970 Staffordshire have failed to win another county championship, and the reformation of the county game at the start of the 21st century saw them drop down to the third tier. In 2016 Staffordshire won both of their pool games in the Shield competition, reaching Twickenham for the very first time. Unfortunately they were unable to add to their silverware as they were beaten 11–30 by Hampshire in the final. Despite losing the final, Staffordshire were promoted to tier 2 of the championships along with winners Hampshire, for the 2017 competition.\nStaffordshire senior men's county side.\nThe Staffordshire seniors men's team currently play in Division 2 of the County Championship.\nHonours:\nAffiliated clubs.\nThere are currently 31 clubs affiliated with the Staffordshire RU, most of which have teams at both senior and junior level and are based in Staffordshire and bordering parts of the West Midlands. Due to county boundary changes enforced by the Local Government Act 1972, several clubs (but not all) who are based in what is now known as West Midlands are also members of the North Midlands RFU as well as the Staffordshire RU.\nCounty club competitions.\nThe Staffordshire RU currently runs the following competitions for club sides based in Staffordshire:"

        "title": "Paris Saint-Germain Boxing",
        "text": "Paris Saint-Germain Boxing, commonly known as Paris Saint-Germain () and familiarly as PSG Boxing, was a French professional boxing club founded in 1992, and based in the city of Paris in France. The club was the boxing department of Paris Saint-Germain until 1997.\nAn initiative from former French professional boxer Jean-Claude Bouttier, PSG boxers trained at a boxing gym located inside Parc des Princes. PSG Boxing consisted of club president Bouttier, managers René Acquaviva and Gilbert Delé, and boxers Philippe Desavoye, Djamel Lifa, Julien Lorcy, Hacine Cherifi, Patrice Aouissi, Ludovic Proto, Philippe Michel, Jean-Claude M'Biye and Khalid Rahilou.\nIn only five years, PSG boxers won six French Championships, three European Championships and one World Championship. However, René Acquaviva's departure in 1997 and the lack of support from the French Boxing Federation saw parent club Paris Saint-Germain dissolve PSG Boxing later that same year.\nHistory.\nEarly years and French titles.\nIn September 1992, a few months after basketball, volleyball, handball and judo, parent club Paris Saint-Germain created its boxing department under the direction of Jean-Claude Bouttier, a former European middleweight champion in the 1970s. Under former French boxing team manager René Acquaviva, five boxers joined Paris Saint-Germain Boxing: Philippe Desavoye, Djamel Lifa, Julien Lorcy, Hacine Cherifi and Patrice Aouissi.\nThese five boxing prospects had participated in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, before discovering professional boxing with PSG. In September 1993, Jean-Claude Bouttier opened a boxing gym inside Parc des Princes, as well as hiring former WBA super-welterweight champion Gilbert Delé.\nIn early 1994, two PSG boxers became French champions - Lifa and Aouissi - while another, Cherifi, missed out and quickly left the club. In May, club president Bouttier confirmed that PSG Boxing would welcome further boxers. Later that year, the club recruited Ludovic Proto, Philippe Michel, Tshimanga M'Biye and current European light-welterweight champion Khalid Rahilou.\nEuropean success.\nIn March 1995, Aouissi became PSG's first European champion. He claimed the cruiserweight title after knocking out Ukrainian fighter Alexander Gurov in the third round. In October 1995, Philippe Michel fought for the WBO light-heavyweight title against German pugilist Dariusz Michalczewski, losing by unanimous decision. Lorcy and Rahilou, for their part, had a better year. The former had a successful tour in the United States, while the latter successfully defended his European title in September, winning by technical knockout against Denmark's Søren Fjordback Søndergaard.\nIn February 1996, Djamel Lifa tried his luck at the European super-featherweight title, but lost on points to Russian fighter Anatoly Alexandrov. In July, a second PSG boxer had his world title chance, but Patrice Aouissi bowed to the Argentine Marcelo Domínguez by technical knockout in the ninth round. Following the fight, tensions between manager René Acquaviva and Aouissi arose due to the former's coaching. Lorcy, in contrast, was crowned European champion at the end of the year, knocking out Russian pugilist Boris Sinitsin in the seventh round.\nWorld title and dissolution.\nIn January 1997, Khalid Rahilou became WBA super-lightweight champion after defeating American fighter Frankie Randall at Nashville by technical knockout in the eleventh round. It was the first time since Alphonse Halimi in 1957 that a French boxer won the WBA title in the USA. Meanwhile, Aouissi continued his downfall by losing his European cruiserweight title against Englishman Johnny Nelson by technical knockout in the seventh round in February 1997.\nA month later, Bobo Lorcy had his first attempt at the WBO super-featherweight title against Mexican pugilist Arnulfo Castillo at the Halle Georges Carpentier in Paris. The fight ended in a draw, despite Lorcy dominating in the final rounds. A rematch later that year also ended in a draw. In the meantime, Lifa was finally crowned European champion in April, defeating compatriot Moussa Sangaré via sixth-round technical knockout. He then retained the title by beating Boris Sinitsin five months later. In July, Rahilou successfully defended his WBA title as well, defeating American fighter Marty Jakubowski by technical knockout in the seventh round.\nBetween 1992 and 1997, PSG boxers won six French championships, three European championships and one world championship. But despite being at its peak, the departure of iconic manager René Acquaviva in the summer of 1997 signalled the premature end of PSG Boxing. Not long after, parent club Paris Saint-Germain, disappointed by the lack of support from the French Boxing Federation, dissolved one of its most decorated departments and closed the boxing gym at Parc des Princes."

        "title": "David Allen (rugby union)",
        "text": "David Allen (born 1981) is a retired English rugby union player who spent the majority of his career at Blackheath, where his position was openside flanker. While at 'Club' Allen become the all-time try scorer in National League 1 history with 147 tries from 274 appearances. As well as playing for Blackheath he was also capped by England Counties XV and the Barbarians.\nCareer.\nEarly career.\nDavid Allen was born on the 29 April 1981 in Hildenborough in Kent, England. Growing up he attended Hugh Christie Technology College in Tonbridge, while his youth rugby was spent at nearby Sevenoaks RFC, who he joined at six and played for until he was seventeen (colts). In 1998 he decided to leave Sevenoaks to join his father's old team, Old Juddians to start his senior career. Although Old Juddians would merge with Tonbridge RFC the following seasons to form Tonbridge Juddians, Allen would stay at the club for six seasons, playing lower league rugby in the London regional divisions.\n2005-08: First seasons at Blackheath.\nAllen's performances for Tonbridge Juddians came to the attention of south-London side Blackheath, playing fours divisions higher in National Division 2. Despite his coaches' warnings that he would never make it at a higher level, Allen decided to join Blackheath, signing for the 2004–05 season. He made his competitive debut on 18 September 2004, as the club drew 13–13 with Launceston at the Rectory Field. He would go on to play 13 games in his first season, scoring 1 try as Blackheath finished in 9th position. The following season would play out the much same way, Allen becoming a regular in a mid-table Blackheath season that finished once again in 9th place.\nThe 2006–07 season was when Allen would start to come to prominence. Starring for a Blackheath side that would improve to a fifth-place finish in the league, Allen's performances saw him selected by the England Counties XV and he made his Counties debut on 23 February 2007, starting in a 17–20 loss away to an Irish Club XV in Dublin. A second England Counties cap would follow that year as he scored a try in a 41–10 win over France Amateurs at the Rectory Field on 16 March 2007. Allen's good form would continue for Blackheath the following season, scoring 9 tries as he helped Blackheath to finish fourth in the league. He was also called back to the England Counties side taking part in FIRA/AER Rugby Festival held in France throughout September, and featured in wins against Russia (76-10) and Spain (21-15). A further honour that season was Allen being called up for the Barbarians, playing in a 24–27 loss to Combined Services at Brickfields in Plymouth on 14 November 2007.\n2009-12: Try scoring prominence.\nThe 2009–10 season would see Allen to start to demonstrate the prolific try scoring form that would characterise his later career at Blackheath. While the previous year had only seen him score 3 league tries all season, he had already eclipsed this figure in his first four games of the new campaign in National League 1 (formerly National 2), including his first ever club hat-trick as his team hammered Manchester 82–0 at home. Allen's form continued throughout the season, contributing 17 tries from just 21 league appearances, including braces against Otley, Manchester and Redruth, as Blackheath finished in 8th place. 2010-11 would follow in much the same vein as Allen scored another 17 tries to finish as Blackheath's top try scorer that year - a figure which included early season hat-tricks against Stourbridge and Macclesfield - as Blackheath improved to 6th place. This prolific scoring form saw Allen return to the England Counties fold, gaining his fifth cap on 18 March 2011, as Counties went down 8–16 to an Irish Club XV in Dublin.\nThe 2011–12 season was to be Allen's most prolific of his senior career. While in previous seasons he tended to score in batches, this campaign he was consistent throughout, and would finish as Blackheath's top try scorer (and joint third in the division tied with Nick Royle) with 25 tries as Blackheath finished in an impressive third in what was a very competitive National League 1 that featured the likes of Jersey and Ealing Trailfinders. Allen's 25 tries featured a hat-trick against Barking along with braces against seven other sides. Unsurprisingly he was also recalled by England Counties, featuring in a 34–16 win over an Irish Club XV at Preston on 16 March 2012. After the successes of 2011-12 Blackheath would struggle in National League 1 dropping down to 10th place. Despite his teams change in fortunes, Allen was still prolific, finishing once more as Blackheath's top try scorer, this time with 19 tries - joint fourth in the division. In February 2013, Allen picked the last of his England Counties caps, appearing in the 20 - 30 loss to an Irish Club XV in Cork on the 8th and 27 – 7 win over France Federale in Ealing on the 22nd.\n2013-15: Last seasons with club.\nBetween 2013 and 2015 Allen appeared and scored regularly in a mid-table Blackheath side, finishing as joint second highest scorer at the end of 2013–14 season with 20 tries (2 behind top scorer, Tyson Lewis). The 2015–16 season was to be the penultimate of Allen's career and would be a notable one for Blackheath as it was their last playing at the legendary Rectory Field having spent the past 158 years there. Blackheath played some good rugby throughout the campaign, at one point looking like they might challenge for the title and promotion to the RFU Championship but in the end finished in 3rd spot behind champions Richmond and Hartpury College. Allen also had a good season, finish as Blackheath's top try scorer with 18 tries and joint 6th overall in the division. It would be his last proper season and although he played 3 games in 2016-17 as Blackheath entered a new era at Well Hall, he decided to call it a day and retire after 13 years at Club.\nHonours and records.\nBlackheath\nEngland Counties XV"

He became a South Australian basketball icon playing for the West Adelaide Bearcats in the SA State League and the National Basketball League (NBL). Richardson, who played his college basketball at Ohio Dominican University and was a Mid Ohio Conference First Team selection in 1970–71, joined West Adelaide in 1974, winning the 1975 Woollacott Medal en route to his first SA state championship. He went on to win the NBL's inaugural Most Valuable Player award in 1979 and led the Bearcats to the NBL championship in 1982 as player-coach.\nEarly life.\nRichardson was born in Zanesville, Ohio. From junior college in Florida, he attended university in Ohio and was invited to attend a Houston Rockets' camp, albeit at his own expense. In 1970–71 and 1972–73, Richardson played for Ohio Dominican University's men's basketball team. In 1970–71, he earned first-team All-MOC honors, and in 1972–73, he was named NAIA All-District 22 Honorable Mention. Richardson scored 1,207 points in two seasons at Ohio Dominican, earning him a place in the school's 1,000-point club.\nGrowing up in Ohio, Richardson was an expert tracker. It made him invaluable in Vietnam as a soldier leading men into battle.\nProfessional career.\nRichardson arrived wide-eyed in Adelaide in 1974 after having turned his back on an NBA career. At 6'6\", he was considered a wiry forward who could play center. He joined the West Adelaide Bearcats and led them to the 1974 grand final. A year later, he won the 1975 Woollacott Medal en route to his first South Australian (SA) state championship. He became the first American to claim the Woollacott Medal, an honor bestowed on the Fairest and Most Brilliant player in the SA State League.\nFor the next two years he dominated in Victoria playing with national powerhouse St Kilda, helping them win the 1977 Australian Club Championship title. He returned to the Bearcats in 1978 and helped them win five straight SA championship titles as player-coach from 1978–82. During this time, in 1979, the National Basketball League (NBL) was established. Richardson was crowned the NBL's inaugural Most Valuable Player before earning All-NBL Team honors the following year.\nAs West's playing coach for four years of NBL, Richardson steered them to fourth, second, third and first. After losing the 1980 grand final significantly to his former team St Kilda and its superstar import guard Rocky Smith, Richardson said he needed a player to counter him. That brought Al Green to the Bearcats in 1981 and a year later, Richardson recruited Leroy Loggins. The trio went on to lead the Bearcats to their first and only NBL championship in 1982. West's 1982 NBL championship team is the only one to include three league MVPs, with Green winning in 1982 and Loggins collecting three outstanding individual player awards in 1984, 1986 and 1987.\nRichardson retired from playing following the 1982 season. He is considered one of the league's three greatest imports, alongside Leroy Loggins and Rocky Smith. In 71 NBL games, he averaged 20.2 points per game. In November 2012, West Adelaide inducted Richardson into the club's Hall of Fame.\nIn 1986, Richardson coached the Geelong Cats in the NBL to a 14–12 record, missing the playoffs on percentage. That year, the team won the VBA championship. He coached the team again in 1987.\nPersonal life.\nIn the late 1970s, Richardson considered taking out Australian citizenship. On the assumption he would, then Boomers coach Lindsay Gaze suited him up for Australia to play against a visiting US college team, making Richardson the only American who was solely an American to officially play for Australia.\nPost-basketball, Richardson worked on oil rigs and on the MS Princess of Tasmania, having a love of the ocean and the open sea. He was also a supporter of the Maritime Workers' Union.\nDeath.\nRichardson died peacefully in a Darwin hospital on October 22, 2013, losing his battle with cancer. He was 63 years old."

The president is Sanele Mthiyane.\nBSA was admitted to FIBA in 1992, and its senior team has since competed at the AfroBasket but has yet to qualify for the FIBA World Cup. The Basketball National League administers the elite men's professional game. BSA is registered with SASCOC as the officially recognised basketball federation.\nThe President of Basketball South Africa is Mr. Sanele Mthiyane.\nHistory.\nThe Basketball Federation of South Africa (BFSA) was founded in 1953. During the time, women were encouraged to play in the similar but different sport of netball. BFSA was expelled from international tournaments in 1980 by the world governing body International Amateur Basketball Federation (FIBA) in opposition towards the racial policies of the government of South Africa, the voting was 49 in favour with 2 against, and 10 abstentions. BFSA had earlier been under suspension since 1977. In 1992, all the racially divided basketball organisations namely – Basketball Federation of South Africa (BFSA) for whites, Midlands Basketball Union (MBU) for coloureds and indians, with the South African Basketball Association (SABA) for blacks were united under the auspices of an interim body called Basketball Union of South Africa (BUSA) that had four members from each organisation, which led to the establishment of Basketball South Africa, and ultimately being readmitted to FIBA.\nIn 2015, the American NBA held an exhibition game in Johannesburg known as the NBA Africa Game in an attempt to popularise the game further. Tickets were quickly sold out although local games receive less attendances. The game involved an all-star Team Africa vs Team World. The NBA held another instalment of the all-star game in 2017."

        "text": "The Ceylon cricket team toured India in December 1932 and January 1933. Ceylon did not then have Test status, but two three-day unofficial Tests were played, both of which were drawn. The tour also included four other first-class matches and four minor matches. It was the first tour abroad by a Ceylonese team. The victories against Patiala and Central Provinces and Berar were Ceylon's first victories in first-class matches.\nThe Ceylon team.\nThe team was considered representative of Ceylon's best cricketers at the time, apart from the unavailability of some prominent European cricketers and some players from outside Colombo. Churchill Gunasekara, the captain, was called back to Ceylon during the tour in his capacity as Chief Medical Officer of Health, Colombo Municipality, in order to deal with a smallpox outbreak, and was absent during the two matches against India, when Ed Kelaart captained the team.\nThe tour.\nJayawickreme took 5 for 58 and 2 for 30 on his first-class debut; Perera took 1 for 29 and 6 for 51.\nMervyn Kelaart scored 101 in the first innings, Ceylon's first international century. For India, Naoomal Jaoomal scored 101 and 32.\nThis was Ceylon's first victory in a first-class match. Churchill Gunasekara captained the team, and Bakelman took 6 for 34 and 6 for 65. For Patiala, Amar Singh took 7 for 69 and 2 for 43.\nNeeding 257 for victory, Ceylon lost their first six wickets for 83, but were able to hang on for a draw with the last batsmen at the crease, thanks largely to Ed Kelaart's 44 at number eight; he also scored 56 in Ceylon's first innings and took 5 for 95 in India's first innings. Jayawickreme scored 130 in the first innings. For India, Mushtaq Ali took 6 for 97 and 4 for 32.\nOf the Indian side, only Naoomal Jaoomal had played in the first match.\nBakelman took 6 for 42 and 5 for 61; Jayawickreme scored 63 and 41 and took 3 for 58 in the second innings. \nPoulier took 5 for 58 in Madras's first innings. For Madras, M. J. Gopalan took 6 for 16, including a hat-trick and four wickets in five balls, and 7 for 57.\nIndia used 21 players in the two international matches, of whom 10 had toured England in 1932. The Yuvraj of Patiala was the captain in the first match, C. K. Nayudu in the second.\nLeading players.\nIn the two matches against India, Ed Kelaart made 160 runs at an average of 40.00 and took 11 wickets at 22.36. Jayawickreme was the leading scorer with 212 runs at 53.00, and Bakelman took 11 wickets at 27.09.\nFor India, Naoomal Jaoomal, the only Indian to play in both matches, scored 252 runs at 84.00. Mushtaq Ali took the most wickets, with 10 at 12.90.\nIn all first-class matches Jayawickreme was the outstanding batsman, with 421 runs at 46.77; he also took 15 wickets at 25.53. Ed Kelaart made 219 runs at 27.37 and took 20 wickets at 21.45. Bakelman was the outstanding bowler, with 35 wickets at 15.28; he took 23 wickets for 202 in the two victories."

Although Taylor managed the cling on to take the third set, he lost the next two easily. In 1914 Taylor lost in the quarter-finals to Rupert Wertheim. In 1919 Taylor led Gerald Patterson two sets to 0 in round two before having to retire. In 1920 Taylor lost in the semis to Pat O'Hara Wood.

        "text": "Christopher Wold Johnson (born August 7, 1959) is an American businessman and sports executive who is the owner and vice chairman of the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He is a great-grandson of Robert Wood Johnson I (co-founder of Johnson &amp; Johnson), and the brother of Woody Johnson who served as the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom from 2017 to 2021. He is the co-owner of the Jets along with his brother Woody and served as the chairman and CEO from 2017 to 2021.\nEarly life.\nJohnson was born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, United States. He is the son of Betty (Wold) and Robert Wood Johnson III, president of Johnson &amp; Johnson for four years. Johnson grew up with four siblings: Woody Johnson, Keith Johnson, Billy Johnson and Elizabeth \"Libet\" Johnson, in affluent areas of northern New Jersey. In 1975, Keith died of a cocaine overdose and Billy died in a motorcycle accident.\nProfessional sports.\nNew York Jets.\nJohnson has been an owner of the New York Jets alongside his brother, Woody, since 2000.\nIn 2017, Johnson became the CEO and chairman of the Jets following Woody's nomination and confirmation to be the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom. Johnson served as operating head of the Jets during his brother's ambassadorial tenure. In his role as owner, Johnson oversaw the promotion of Hymie Elhai as team president, Joe Douglas as General Manager, and Robert Saleh as head coach. It was Christopher Johnson who fired Adam Gase following the 2020 season.\nIn addition to his Jets role, Johnson serves as a member of the NFL's Media Owned and Operated committee.\nStance on Kneeling.\nJohnson has supported the collective actions of his players' rights and privileges to kneel or to stay in the locker room during the pre-game playing of the American anthem. While he was one of the NFL Team owners that voted for the policy enacted in May 2018 to penalize and fine any player who does not stand during the Anthem he has offered to pay the fines incurred by players who choose to kneel or stay in the locker room stating:\"If somebody [on the Jets] takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players.\" Johnson said. \"I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer that they stand? Of course. But I understand if they felt the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we're all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines. I don't want to come down on them like a ton of bricks, and I won't. There will be no club fines or suspensions or any sort of repercussions. If the team gets fined, that's just something I'll have to bear.\""

Established in 1985, they joined the Great West League in 2017 having replaced the Yuba City Bears who went dormant the same day the Seals were announced as new members. The Seals play their home games at College of Alameda Stadium.\nTeam history.\nThe current Seals team was named after the former minor league baseball team that played in the Pacific Coast League from 1903 to 1957 at practically ALL levels of play. This team was founded by Abel Alcantar, who was a high school baseball coach at the time. He was approached by a local scout who suggested that he form a summer team for the San Francisco Public School System. So Alcantar founded the San Francisco Seals 18 &amp; Under team. The following year he founded a 16 &amp; Under team as well. In 1987, Alcantar continued the tradition and formed a team for those over the age of 18. Alcantar owned and funded these teams individually; he received some coaching support, but no financial assistance. All three clubs were maintained until the early 90s when he decided to concentrate his efforts on the 18 &amp; Over collegiate team. These days the Seals are once again expanding into teams from the youth levels all the way to collegiate level. Coach Alcantar has a well qualified coaching career and has also been fortunate enough to be a professional baseball scout for few MLB clubs. Some of the places he has had coaching stints at are City College of San Francisco, Skyline College, Laney College, and Cal State East Bay. The Major League Baseball teams he was an associated scout for included the Milwaukee Brewers and New York Mets.\nOn November 7, 2017, the GWL announced that the Seals were joining the GWL replacing the Yuba City Bears for 2018. After the 2018 season, the GWL folded and the Seals became an independent team playing non-league schedules.\nNotable alumni.\nTo be announced\nRadio broadcasts.\nTo be announced..."

The team was led by head coach Tony Bennett in his ninth year, and played their home games at John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference.\nIn a year with low expectations from the press, the Cavaliers began unranked but ascended all the way to the No. 1 ranking in the AP Poll for the first time since December 1982. The team then held on to that ranking through the end of the regular season and became the first ACC team to win 17 conference games. The Cavaliers won the ACC tournament by handily defeating Louisville 75–58, Clemson 64–58, and North Carolina 71–63 in the championship game. In the process the team broke the school's single-season win record, which had twice been tied by Bennett-led teams in the past five years.\nACC Sixth Man of the Year De'Andre Hunter broke his wrist in the ACC Tournament victory, and was announced to be out for the NCAA tournament two days before it began. UVA entered as the No. 1 overall seed, placed in the South regional, but suffered an upset in the first round to UMBC and became the first No. 1 seed to lose to a No. 16 seed since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985. The first round losses by No. 1 seed Virginia and No. 4 seed Arizona, and second round losses by No. 2 seed Cincinnati and No. 3 seed Tennessee, led to the South Region becoming the first ever to not advance any of its top four seeds to the Sweet Sixteen.\nNevertheless, for taking an unranked team to finish four games above pre-season AP No. 1 ranked Duke and winning the ACC Tournament over North Carolina, Bennett was awarded his third Henry Iba Award for the nation's top coach of the season.\nPrevious season.\nThe Cavaliers finished the 2016–17 season 23–11, and 11–7 in ACC play to tie Duke for fifth place. They defeated Pittsburgh in the second round of the ACC tournament to advance to the quarterfinals where they lost to Notre Dame. The Wahoos received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 5 seed in the East region.

The team is operated by the Mexico Rugby League and sanctioned by the Rugby League International Federation to represent Mexico at international level in the sport of rugby league.\nHistory.\nRugby league was introduced to Mexico in 2014 when the Mexico Rugby League organization was formed and organized the first domestic competition, involving three teams from the Mexico City and Guadalajara regions. Mexico Rugby League continued to host domestic competitions at both 13-a-side and 9-a-side in 2015 and 2016 as well as regional representative matches.\nIn November 2017, Mexico was scheduled to make its international debut in the inaugural Latin American Rugby League Championship, hosted in Los Ángeles, Chile.

It was run on November 4, 2017, at Del Mar Racetrack in Del Mar, California with a purse of $6,000,000. It was expected to be a showdown between the top two horses in North America, Gun Runner and Arrogate, with several other Grade/Group 1 winners providing additional depth in an 11 horse field. However, Arrogate broke poorly and was never a factor in the race. Gun Runner led for most of the race and scored a comfortable victory, likely wrapping up Horse of the Year honors.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nThe 2017 Classic was the final encounter between Arrogate, who won the 2016 Classic, and Gun Runner. Arrogate beat Gun Runner in the 2017 Dubai World Cup in an outstanding performance that made him the world's top ranked racehorse. After returning to North America, Arrogate finished a distant fourth in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar Racetrack, leaving questions about whether he liked the surface or if he was no longer at peak ability. He then finished second in the Pacific Classic and trainer Bob Baffert decided to train the colt up to the Classic – a layoff of over two months.\nBy contrast, Gun Runner had steadily improved in the summer of 2017, easily winning both the Stephen Foster Handicap and Whitney Stakes. In his final prep for the Classic, he won the Woodward Stakes by lengths. Based on these strong performances, Gun Runner was made the slight morning-line favorite for the Classic at 9–5, with Arrogate at 2–1. One question mark was that Gun Runner had never won at the distance of 10 furlongs.\nOther leading contenders included:\nIn the post position draw held on October 30, Arrogate drew post 1 on the rail. To avoid getting trapped in traffic, jockey Mike Smith announced that he would ride the colt aggressively from the starting gate. Gun Runner drew the more favorable post position 5.\nTrainer Bob Baffert had a record four horses in the field – Arrogate, Collected, West Coast and Mubtaahij – all of whom were given strong chances to win. Baffert said of Gun Runner, \"He's the only thing between me and a big, fat check.\" Baffert had won the Classic three years in a row with Bayern, American Pharoah and Arrogate.\nIrish trainer Aidan O'Brien had two entries, Churchill and War Decree, neither of which has previously raced on the dirt. Churchill, a dual classic winner at a mile, was given the best chance of the two. \"He is very like Giant's Causeway\", said O'Brien. \"He is miler that you would like to think will get a mile and a quarter.\"\nRace Description.\nGun Runner broke well and quickly moved up to the lead with Collected pressing him on the outside. Gun Runner ran a fast opening quarter, then moved easily around the first turn and down the backstretch as jockey Florent Geroux kept him on a loose rein. Rounding the final turn, Collected closed ground and the two were head-and-head with a quarter of a mile remaining. Entering the stretch, Gun Runner responded to the challenge and pulled away, winning by lengths. Collected held on for second while West Coast was third.\nGun Runner's win came against an apparent track bias: in most other races that week at Del Mar, races had been won by horses that raced off the rail and came from behind. \"My horse was very comfortable right there, and flopping his ear back and forth\", said Geroux. \"I just tried to keep him as happy as I could.\"\nBy contrast, Arrogate ducked in at the start and lost over 11 lengths to Gun Runner during the first quarter mile. Never a factor in the race, he made a mild rally in the stretch to finish in a dead heat for fifth place with Gunnevera. \"He just can't find the plate\", said Baffert. \"I hate to make excuses for the big horse, but he's just not the horse he was.\"\nThe performance solidified Gun Runner's bid for American Horse of the Year honors, based on his record of five wins and a second from six starts during 2017.\nResults.\nTimes: – 0:22.50; – 0:46.31; – 1:10.50; mile – 1:35.03; final – 2:01.29.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:22.50) (:23.81) (:24.19) (:24.53) (:26.26)\nSource: Equibase Chart\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "text": "The 1973–74 Serie A basketball championship was the 51st season of the Serie A, the highest professional basketball league in Italy.\nThe regular season ran from 4 November 1973 to 5 May 1974, with fourteen teams playing 26 games each. Defending champions Ignis Varese won the title anew (their second in succession and seventh overall) and qualified for the European Champions Cup.\nPreseason.\nOne of the major preseason transfers did not concern a player but rather a coach, as Ignis Varese replaced the successful Aca Nikolić with Sandro Gamba, formerly assistant coach at fierce rivals Simmenthal Milano.\nDespite the league holders losing former captain Ottorino Flaborea, \ntheir team was just as strong as they still possessed American sharpshooter Bob Morse as their foreign import and Italian giant Dino Meneghin (generally seen as the best domestic player).\nTheir rivals from Milan also saw a major off-court change with the departure of long-time sponsor Simmenthal who were replaced by car-maker Innocenti, with a subsequent uniform change from red to blue. \nRegardless of the overhaul, Innocenti Milano kept their coach Cesare Rubini and most of their major Italian players such as Giulio Iellini, Renzo Bariviera, Giuseppe Brumatti and Massimo Masini.\nHowever, they had replaced fiery American Art Kenney and Italian international Giorgio Giomo (respectively by unproven compatriot George Brosterhous and promising Vittorio Ferracini).\nComing off a season where they had won absolutely everything (the domestic league and cup, European cup and Intercontinental cup) Ignis were obvious favourites to retain their title.\nTheir challengers were also obvious; Innocenti Milano, who had lost no ambition with the sponsor change and Forst Cantù.\nThe ambitious Cantù counted on American center Bob Lienhard and young dynamic Italians in the vein of Pierluigi Marzorati and Carlo Recalcati to upset the more established duo, and could afford to sell the promising Luciano Vendemini to promoted Brina Rieti for a then record 100 million lire.\nThe other eleven teams in the league were seen as mostly evenly matched, with little hope of bothering the leading trio, though some, for example the rechristened Sinudyne Bologna coached by the brilliant Dan Peterson, hoped to.\nDue to league regulations mandating clubs to play in arenas holding at least 3,500 spectators, four clubs relocated for the season, with Forst Cantù, Canon Venezia, Saclà Asti and Brina Rieti respectively moving to arenas in Brescia, Vicenza, Turin and Rome.\nRegular season.\nThe first meeting between the undefeated top three sides took place in the sixth round as a red hot Forst Cantù hosted a stop-start Ignis Varese.\nForm proved key as Marzorati's 31 points and good playmaking helped Cantù comfortably overcome Varese 84-75 as the visitors offered little support to star Bob Morse's 35 points.\nThe winners were joined with a perfect record at first place by Innocenti Milano.\nIgnis and Innocenti met on 6 January 1974, with the latter then topping the league (Forst had lost in between).\nHowever it was the former that would prevail, toppling Innocenti 78-67 after dominating them in both offense and defence (with 42 rebounds to 29 for example).\nThough Morse (25 points) and Meneghin (23 points and 20 rebounds) stood out for the winners, it was a clinical team performance that overcame their rivals, who offered little resistance as shown by Brosterhous's poor showing (8 points).\nWith this win, Ignis joined Innocenti and Forst as co-leaders.\nThe status quo didn't last long as Cantù were left behind after the Milanese beat them 80-75 later that month in the twelfth round as star player Marzorati was hampered by an ankle injury.\nOn 17 February, Innocenti themselves were evicted from first place by a surprise 69-70 defeat to modest Brill Cagliari which left Ignis alone on top.\nWith an injured Brumatti missing for Innocenti, Mauro Cerioni's 26 points were not enough as Brosterhous disappointed with 10 points compared to 20 for Brill's American John Sutter.\nOnce again the match-up between Ignis and Innocenti, this time in Milan, had aspects of a league final, with the home team needing to win to join Ignis in first place.\nThe Milanese managed to do just that, downing Varese 67-65 in a close-knit tie.\nThough the visitors led 46-37 at half-time in large part thanks to its star duo of Morse (25 points overall) and Meneghin, they had lost playmaker Aldo Ossola to a season ending knee injury earlier in the game and could not shake off their rivals.\nInnocenti put in an assured collective performance, with notable performances from Bariviera and Ferracini, clawing at Ignis' lead until Cerioni scored a long range basket with seconds left to take the game.\nDespite this victory, Innocenti saw the first place slip away from them in the penultimate league round as they lost 76-68 away to a competitive Forst.\nThough they missed Lienhard to injury, Cantù could count on the ever reliable Marzorati to answer Barivera's 24 points. \nThe result virtually handed Ignis the title with only one round left to play against uncompetitive opposition and a two-point lead over Innocenti and Forst in second place.\nThis proved to be the case as Ignis Varese had a routine 94-74 win over Brill Cagliari to win the league outright and take home their seventh title.\nA more undecided competition saw Bob Morse and Brill's John Sutter face each other to determine the league's top scorer, with the first scoring 45 points to Sutter's 28 to take the crown.\nInnocenti Milano finished second as Forst Cantù surprisingly lost their final match against Saclà Asti to settle for third place, far ahead of the rest of the league.\nAt the other end of the table, three teams on the same points would face each other in relegation playoffs to avoid joining the long since relegated Maxmobili Pesaro, namely Alco Bologna, Fag Napoli and Snaidero Udine.\nStandings.\nSource: Lega

playoffs.\nThe relegation playoffs were played on 24–26 May 1974 in Genoa.\nAlco Bologna lost their two games and were relegated to the newly created Serie A2, rendering Snaidero Udine's win over Fag Napoli in the final game anecdotal.\nItalian Cup.\nHolders and league champions Ignis Varese (missing both Ossola and Meneghin to injury) were upset by relegation contender Snaidero Udine 82-81 in the semi-final with Snaidero's Italian internationals Claudio Malagoli and Giorgio Giomo proving decisive (33 and 22 points respectively).\nThe final, played in Vicenza on 12 May 1974, saw Sinudyne Bologna down Snaidero 90-74 to claim the cup (and a spot in the European Cup Winners' Cup).\nIn an easy win, the Bolognese were led by American sharpshooter John Fultz as he scored 28 points in his last game for them, while Malagoli (16 points) could not repeat his heroics. \nIn the match for third place, Ignis beat the other semi-finalist Saclà Asti 80-73 to close out their season.\nChampionship-winning squad.\nIgnis Varese 1973–74 Serie A champions\nSource: Lega Basket"

        "text": "Samuel David Simmonds (born 10 November 1994) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a back row forward for Top 14 side Montpellier. After graduating through their academy, Simmonds made his Exeter Chiefs debut in November 2012.\nEarly life.\nSimmonds was born in Torquay and grew up in Teignmouth, Devon playing for local club Teignmouth RFC in his youth. His father and uncle are both in the fishing industry. As a child, he wanted to be a footballer, but after earning selection to play rugby for Devon aged fourteen, he switched his focus to it.\nHis younger brother, Joe Simmonds, also plays rugby union for Exeter Chiefs and has represented England at youth levels as a fly-half.\nAt age 18 Simmonds weighed about 85 kg.\nClub career.\nSimmonds came through the Exeter Chiefs academy, making his debut for the senior side in an Anglo-Welsh Cup game against London Welsh in November 2012. In February 2017, Simmonds played his first Premiership match for Exeter Chiefs against Wasps, earning the player of the Match award. In the 2017 Premiership semi-final against Saracens, Simmonds came on as a replacement when Chiefs were down three points towards the end of the game, scoring the winning try from a driving maul. He then featured again as a replacement in the final as Exeter defeated Wasps to be crowned champions of England for the first time in their history.\nSimmonds scored a try in the 2020 European Rugby Champions Cup Final as Exeter defeated Racing to become champions of Europe for the first time. The following weekend saw Exeter overcome Wasps in the Premiership final to complete a league and European double. At the end of this season Simmonds was named European Player of the Year. He became the seventh Englishman to receive the 'Anthony Foley Memorial Trophy’, following in the footsteps of Jonny Wilkinson (2013), Steffon Armitage (2014), Nick Abendanon (2015), Maro Itoje (2016), Owen Farrell (2018) and Alex Goode (2019).\nOn 20 November 2020 Exeter opened the new Premiership season away at Harlequins, winning 33–3, with Simmonds scoring three tries – including an outstanding long-range effort – and taking the ‘man-of-the-match’ award. In doing so, he took his try tally in the Premiership to 34 in 49 games – and 47 in 70 games for Chiefs overall. By the end of 2020, Simmonds had scored eight tries in the four Premiership games Chiefs had played, and also scored a try in the Champions Cup game against Glasgow Warriors. During the Chiefs' match against London Irish on 18 May, Simmonds scored his 17th try of the season to draw level with the Premiership try-scoring record, before scoring his 18th and 19th tries of the season.\nSimmonds left Exeter at the end of the 2022–23 season to join French Top14 side Montpellier.\nInternational career.\nEngland.\nIn October 2017 Simmonds received his first call-up to the senior England squad by coach Eddie Jones for the 2017 Autumn Internationals. On 11 November 2017 Simmonds made his debut against in 21–8 win at Twickenham. Later in the autumn series he made his first start against Samoa.\nWith Billy Vunipola and Nathan Hughes, Eddie Jones' first and second choice at No.8, unavailable through injury, Simmonds was called up to the England squad for the 2018 Six Nations Championship. He started in England's first match of the tournament against Italy, and scored two tries to help England to a 46–15 victory in Rome. In September 2021 after more than three years without playing for England Simmonds was recalled for the autumn International Series. He came off the bench in victories over Australia and South Africa.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nOn 6 May 2021, Simmonds was named in the squad for the 2021 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa. His one Test appearance came as a second-half replacement for Jack Conan in the final game of the series as the Lions suffered a narrow defeat.\nHonours.\nExeter\nIndividual"

A maximum of 26 athletes can be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 14 men or 14 women.\nAllocation of quotas.\nAt the end of the qualification period of 22 January 2018 quotas will be awarded using the Olympic Quota Allocation List (which includes all results of the World Cups from July 2016 and the results of the 2017 World Championship). The spots will be awarded to each country per athlete appearing on the list starting at number one per event until a maximum for each event is reached. Once an NOC has reached the maximum of 4 quota spots in an event, it will no longer be counted for the allocation of quotas. If a nation goes over the total of 14 per sex or 26 total it is up to that nation to select its team to meet the rules by January 24, 2018.

If a country rejects a quota spot then additional quotas become available. A country can be eligible for more than one quota spot per event in the reallocation process. The numbers in brackets indicate the number of quotas to be reallocated, a strike through indicates no interest, and bolding indicates acceptance of the quota."

        "title": "Pro Tennis Tour 2",
        "text": "Pro Tennis Tour 2 (published as Great Courts 2 in France and Germany, and Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour in North America) is a sports video game developed by Blue Byte Software for the Amiga and published by Ubisoft in 1991. It is the sequel to the 1989 game \"Pro Tennis Tour\" (also released as \"Great Courts\"). \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\" was ported to MS-DOS compatible operating systems and the Atari ST. A sequel, \"Jimmy Connors Pro Tennis Tour\" (1992), was released for the Super Nintendo.\nGameplay.\nPlayers have three different game modes to play; \"practice\", \"ball machine\", and \"tournament\". \"Practice\" is a quick start mode, where the player can play single matches against the computer. \"Ball machine\" features the player returning balls from a motorized tennis serving machine. \"Tournament\" lets the player proceed through generated tournaments, and eventually Grand Slams. The player can also sign up to play doubles during each tournament and even compete in the Davis Cup. Players can also see statistics of match wins, tournament wins, and also prize money earned over the career.\nMatches and tournaments can be played on many different surfaces. Matches can take place on \"grass\" (textured green) for a fast-paced game, \"clay\" (textured brown) which has a significantly slower pace, and \"asphalt\" (textured grey) with the fastest play speed of all of the courts. The game is controlled with a joypad and keyboard combination on all consoles. The game can be played by one or two players, either controlling a player or a team each, and can also be played co-cooperatively, with players forming a doubles pair. Each of the individual player characters have different strengths, and weaknesses, with variables such as forehand, backhand and fitness.\nDevelopment.\n\"Pro Tennis Tour 2\" was created by a team of five at Blue Byte Software. This team included coding by Lothar Schmitt, graphics by János Tóth, Thorsten Knop &amp; Uwe Meier, and score by Haiko Ruttmann. Lothar Schmitt was also involved with the project. The game was released entirely in English, but the manual was also released in German, and French.\nThe Amiga game was published by Ubisoft in 1991 in the United Kingdom, and the United States, and was later released in France, and Germany in 1993. The game was also released in Italy by distribution company \"Leader\", and Spain by Spanish publisher \"Dro Soft\". The game was also self-published for DOS in 1991.\nThe game would later have an unofficial sequel in \"Game, Net &amp; Match!\" also released by Blue Byte Software in 1998 for Windows. The game's features expand on those in \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\", and add internet play. Due to the game's differing name, and move to 3D, the game was never officially released as a sequel to the \"Pro Tennis Tour\" series. Its working title however was \"Great Courts 3\"'.\nReception.\nReviews for the game were almost universally positive. \"Amiga Power\" reviewed the game as 4/5 stars, claiming \"possibly the most realistic sports sim to grace the Amiga, with features galore\". \"The One for ST\" magazine agreed, giving the game 90%, stating the game was \"simply the best tennis sim that money could buy\".\n\"The One for Amiga Games\" reviewed the Amiga version of \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\" in 1991, giving it an overall score of 90%, beginning their review by expressing that it improves upon its predecessor, stating that \"the original \"Pro Tennis Tour\" was a quality simulation of tennis but it had a few significant drawbacks, all of which have been rectified in this sequel. Two players can now compete at tournament level, there is a doubles option (including the unusual doubles verus single player mode), and you now have a choice of male or female players\". \"The One\" praises \"Pro Tennis Tour 2's\" gameplay as \"satisfying\", calling its controls \"much more user friendly\", and furthermore states that \"the quality and range of computer opponents is superb. It's changes like this that make this sequel totally different from its predecessor\". \"The One\" praises the ability to edit player statistics as \"an excellent additional feature\" that \"genuinely affects your [abilities]\", and praises the graphics as having \"subtle\" and \"mostly smooth\" animation and expresses that the sound effects are \"just about spot on\". Despite this, \"The One\" expresses that \"it's much more difficult serving down than up the screen, and more pre-match selection screens could be more aesthetically presented\". \"The One\" acknowledges these criticisms as \"minor\" and concludes by calling \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\" \"a brilliant tennis simulation that is as close to being definitive as you are likely to get\".\nHowever, \"Computer and Video Games\" magazine wrote that \"the problem with \"Pro Tennis Tour 2\", is that underneath the flashy exterior, lies a pretty basic game\", but still gave the game 80/100. \"Amiga Format\" said the game was difficult saying \"it does take a lot of learning if you want to be able to play and beat the computer opposition\", and scored the game 82%.\n\"Pro Tennis Tour\" would be ranked number 42 in \"Amiga Power's\" list of 100 all-time best Amiga games in 1991.\nThe series sold 513,000 copies worldwide."

        "text": "Tennis World Tour is a tennis video game developed by Breakpoint Studio and published by Bigben Interactive for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows. It was released on May 22, 2018 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and the physical PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions in Australia and New Zealand, as well as the Microsoft Windows and Nintendo Switch versions, was released on October 29.\nDevelopment.\nThe game was developed by Breakpoint Studio. It was published by French publisher, Bigben Interactive, who hurried it to market when it was only 20% complete.\nSpeaking to French publication Le Monde, and translated by NintendoLife, BigBen founder Alain Falc said the game was \"only 20% completed a few weeks before its release\" but needed to be released in order to capitalise on the French Open and avoid \"losing the benefit of marketing campaigns already committed\" and added that BigBen \"put 500,000 pieces on the market but with many distributors who have no right of return, so we know that will be profitable\".\nReception.\nThe critical response to \"Tennis World Tour\" has ranged from highly negative to at best average. \"Xbox Tavern\" was sharp, writing: \"Tennis is a game of fluidity and precision, two things that Tennis World Tour, despite its decent career mode, fails miserably to realize\". \"Game Informer\" was no more positive, writing that \"even \"Pong\" had a reliability about it that this game lacks, and that was over 45 years ago\" and giving the game 4/10. The \"Last Word On Tennis\" website, meanwhile, was highly critical of the state that the game was launched in, saying that while future updates may well improve the experience, at launch \"the game is a complete mess. It's like an alpha version of the game\" and gave the game 2/5. French publication, \"Gameblog.fr\", was also critical of the game claiming the heritage of \"Top Spin\": \"Claiming Top Spin's heritage probably put too much pressure on Breakpoint to begin with, even more so considering the studio's obvious resource limitations comparatively\" and gave the game 5/10.\nThe game shipped 500,000 units to market, which is not to say it sold that many at retail but, according to Bigben Interactive founder Alain Falc, \"many distributors who have no right of return, so we know that will be profitable\".\nLaunch controversy.\n\"Tennis World Tour\" was advertised right up until release as having online multiplayer available in the game from launch. However, when the game launched, critics and players found that the \"online multiplayer\" component of the game was not present, and that a statement had been issued from the developer that it would be added in at a later date. The company apologized for what the media described as a bait-and-switch by promising players online multiplayer throughout the pre-order window.\neSports.\nThe French Tennis Federation hosted a \"Tennis World Tour\" eSports tournament in 2018 and 2019, with the final staged at the Stade Roland-Garros during the French Open.\nOrganisers of the Madrid Open hosted a virtual tournament using the game during the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament featured a men's and women's draws with players playing as themselves in the game. The event was won by real life Madrid Open winners Andy Murray and Kiki Bertens.\nSequel.\nA sequel, \"Tennis World Tour 2\", was released on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and Windows in September 2020."

Regional champions competed in Super Regionals, a best-of-three-game series, to determine the eight participants in the College World Series. For the first time, the Tournament seeded the top 16 teams instead of pairing teams generally along geographical lines.\nIn the championship series, Arkansas won the first game and held a 3–2 lead entering the top of the ninth inning in game 2. With two outs and a runner on third, Oregon State shortstop Cadyn Grenier popped a foul ball down the right field line that multiple Razorback players appeared to have a play on. Had the ball been caught, Arkansas would have won their first national championship in baseball; instead, the ball dropped between the first baseman, second baseman, and right fielder to continue the at-bat. Two pitches later, with the Beavers down to their final strike, Grenier singled in the tying run, and was followed by Trevor Larnach's two-run homer to give OSU a 5–3 lead and the eventual victory to even the series. The following day, Oregon State freshman Kevin Abel – who threw 23 pitches the previous night – notched a 129-pitch complete game shutout, allowing just two hits and retiring the final 20 Razorback hitters to secure the Beavers' third national title in baseball. Oregon State catcher Adley Rutschman was named College World Series Most Outstanding Player after collecting 13 RBI's and a College World Series record 17 hits.\nNational seeds.\n16 National Seeds were announced on the Selection Show Monday, May 28 at 12 p.m. EDT on ESPNU.

The championship has been awarded every four years since the first tournament in 1930, except in 1942 and 1946, due to World War II.\nThe tournament consists of two parts, the qualification phase and the final phase (officially called the \"World Cup Finals\"). The qualification phase, which currently take place over the three years preceding the Finals, is used to determine which teams qualify for the Finals. The current format of the Finals involves 32 teams competing for the title, at venues within the host nation (or nations) over a period of about a month. The World Cup Finals is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world, with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the 2006 tournament final.\nIceland made its debut at the FIFA World Cup in 2018 after having failed 12 consecutive qualification campaigns from 1974 to 2014. The nation first attempted to qualify for the tournament back in 1958.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup was Iceland's second major international tournament, having also qualified for UEFA Euro 2016.\nIceland is the smallest nation to reach the World Cup Group Stage, breaking the record set by Trinidad and Tobago.\nRussia 2018.\nFollowing a 2–0 home win over Kosovo in the final round of the qualifiers, Iceland secured their spot in Russia 2018, finishing top of Group I by two points over Croatia, who had defeated Iceland in the World Cup play-offs four years earlier.

        "title": "Pakistani cricket team in Ireland in 2018",
        "text": "The Pakistan cricket team visited Ireland in May 2018 to play a Test match against the Ireland cricket team. It was the first Test match played by the Ireland men's team since they were awarded Test status by the International Cricket Council (ICC) in June 2017. The Ireland women's cricket team had previously played a Women's Test match, also against Pakistan, in July 2000.\nPakistan won the one-off fixture by five wickets, with Ireland's Kevin O'Brien named as the man of the match, after he scored the first century for Ireland in Test cricket. Despite the loss, Cricket Ireland deemed the match to be a great success. Pakistan's captain, Sarfaraz Ahmed, praised the performance of the Ireland team during the match.\nBackground.\nIn July 2000, the Ireland and Pakistan women's teams faced each other in a Women's Test match at College Park, Dublin. Ireland women won the match by an innings and 54 runs, with Isobel Joyce named as the player of the match. It was the first Test match played by the Ireland women's cricket team.\nOn 22 June 2017, at the ICC's annual conference, the Ireland and Afghanistan men's teams were awarded Test status, becoming Full Members of the ICC in the process. The ICC confirmed that a single Test match would be played between Ireland and Pakistan during their meeting in Auckland in October 2017. Cricket Ireland confirmed the date of the Test match at their board meeting in October 2017, with The Village, Malahide, announced as the venue the following month. The match took place ahead of Pakistan's Test series against England and their T20I series against Scotland.\nThe ICC appointed three English officials for the match. Richard Illingworth and Nigel Llong were the on-field umpires, with Chris Broad named as the match referee. The Decision Review System (DRS) was not used for the Test match, as Cricket Ireland decided they could not afford the cost of using the system.\nWarren Deutrom, CEO of Cricket Ireland, said that he was \"delighted\" that Ireland's debut Test match will be played at home and thanked the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) in being Ireland's first Test opponent. Cricket Ireland's director of high performance, Richard Holdsworth, said that Ireland would like to play a return fixture in Pakistan, as long as the security situation in the country remains stable. Deutrom later confirmed that they were considering the PCB's request to tour Pakistan at a later date.\nPakistan's last international fixtures before the Test match was a three-match Twenty20 International (T20I) series against the West Indies in Karachi in April 2018. Pakistan won the series 3–0. Pakistan's last Test match fixtures were against Sri Lanka, in the United Arab Emirates, in September and October 2017. Sri Lanka won both matches. Ireland had played in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Zimbabwe in March 2018. They finished the tournament in fifth place, from the ten teams that took part, failing to qualify for the 2019 Cricket World Cup.\nAhead of the Test match, Ireland's captain, William Porterfield, said that he was hoping local conditions would help his side, adding that subcontinental teams take some time to adjust. Pakistan's captain, Sarfaraz Ahmed, said that the team was really looking forward to playing against Ireland and was confident his young side would perform well in difficult conditions. Sarfraz later went on to say that \"it is a big honour for me and my team to play this historic Test match\" and that the team was ready to play. At a press conference the day before the match, Porterfield said that \"a lot of people have devoted a lot of their lives to make this happen\" and that \"it is going to be a pretty special occasion\".\nSquads.\nIn April 2018, Pakistani leg-spin bowler Yasir Shah was ruled out for ten weeks, due to stress fracture of a hip, causing him to miss the match. The report said that Yasir would need to \"undergo extensive rehabilitation\". The Pakistan selectors were reportedly considering either leg spinner Shadab Khan (who was chosen) or left-arm spinner Kashif Bhatti as his replacement.\nLater that month, following a five-day training camp at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore, the PCB named a sixteen-man squad for the tour to the United Kingdom and Ireland, including five uncapped players at Test level. In the same month, Cricket Ireland named twenty-six players who took part in two warm-up fixtures ahead of the final selection for the Test match. Seventeen of Ireland's international players also took part in the opening fixture of the 2018 Inter-Provincial Championship, which started on 1 May 2018.\nOn 4 May 2018, Cricket Ireland announced the squad for the match, with William Porterfield captaining the team. Of the fourteen players named in Ireland's squad, Boyd Rankin had previously played in one Test for England, in the 2013–14 Ashes series. Ed Joyce had also previously played for England, featuring in seventeen One Day Internationals (ODIs) between 2006 and 2007.\nTwo days before the Test, Nathan Smith suffered an injury and was ruled out of Ireland's squad. He was replaced by Craig Young. Prior to travelling to Ireland, Pakistan played two first-class cricket matches in England, against Kent and Northamptonshire. On the day before the Test, Sarfaraz Ahmed confirmed that the eleven that played against Northamptonshire would be the same side to play against Ireland. Therefore, Imam-ul-Haq and Faheem Ashraf both made their Test debuts.\nAfter making his debut for Ireland, Ed Joyce joined his sister Isobel in becoming only the second brother and sister to have played in Test cricket, following Denise Emerson and Terry Alderman of Australia. Ed and Isobel Joyce are also the only brother and sister to have made their Test debuts when playing for their respective gender teams on their country's first ever Test appearances.\nMatch.\nOnly Test.\nNo play was possible on the first day due to rain, therefore Ireland became the first side to have the opening day of their maiden Test washed out. As a result of no play on the first day, Cricket Ireland lost €75,000 in ticket refunds. Play finally got underway on the second day, with Ireland winning the toss and electing to field. Tim Murtagh became the first bowler for Ireland to bowl a ball in Test cricket. Boyd Rankin took Ireland's first wicket in Tests, dismissing Pakistan's Azhar Ali, who was caught by William Porterfield at second slip. Rankin became the first player since Kepler Wessels in 1994, and fifteenth cricketer overall, to play Test cricket for two different national teams. Kevin O'Brien became the first sportsperson from Ireland to appear in 300 matches for his country. Reflecting on the day, Ireland's wicket-keeper, Gary Wilson, said that Pakistan \"got away from us a little at the end\" but added that it was a very proud moment for everyone to be presented with their first Test cap.\nPakistan declared their first innings before lunch on day three, after scoring 310 runs for the loss of nine wickets. Faheem Ashraf top-scored for Pakistan, with 83 runs, including the fastest Test fifty on debut by a batsman for Pakistan, from 52 balls. Ed Joyce faced the first delivery and scored the first run for Ireland in Test cricket. He also became the first batsman to be dismissed for Ireland, when he was out lbw, bowled by Mohammad Abbas. Ireland were eventually all out for 130 runs, with Kevin O'Brien top-scoring with 40, and Mohammad Abbas finishing with four wickets for 44 runs. For the first time in sixteen years, when New Zealand played in Lahore in 2002, Pakistan enforced the follow-on. Ireland finished day three on 64 without losing a wicket, trailing by 116 runs, with Ed Joyce on 39 not out. After the close of play, Joyce said that \"it was a tough wicket, but it has flattened out a little bit\", adding that \"the first session tomorrow is going to be really important\".\nIn the first session of day four, Andrew Balbirnie was dismissed for a pair, therefore becoming the 44th batsman, and first for Ireland, to get a pair on debut in Test cricket. In the second session, Mohammad Amir took his 100th Test wicket, becoming the second left-arm fast bowler for Pakistan to reach the milestone. At the tea interval, Ireland had a lead of 32 runs, with Kevin O'Brien scoring the first fifty in Tests for Ireland. In the final session of day four, O'Brien went on to score his maiden century, and the first for Ireland. He became the 105th batsman to do so on debut in Tests, and the fourth to score a century in their country's maiden Test. Ireland finished the day seven wickets down, with a lead of 139 runs, and O'Brien unbeaten on 118. Afterwards, O'Brien said that it was a \"very proud and emotional\" moment to score a Test century, and ranked it second on his own personal list, behind the century he scored in the 2011 Cricket World Cup against England in Bangalore. Pakistan's opening batsman, Azhar Ali, said that \"the partnership between Thompson and Kevin took the game away from us\" and gave credit to the Ireland players and how they batted.\nAt the start of the fifth and final day, O'Brien did not add to his overnight score, being dismissed for the first ball he faced. Mohammad Abbas took the remaining two wickets, to take his second five-wicket haul in Tests, in his sixth match. With Ireland bowled out for 339, that set Pakistan a target of 160 runs to win. Pakistan won the match by five wickets, in the penultimate session of the match, with an unbeaten fifty by debutant Imam-ul-Haq and a fifty from Babar Azam. Ireland's Kevin O'Brien won the man of the match award for his batting performance. As a result, O'Brien broke into the top 100 in the ICC Player Rankings for Test batsmen, at position 66. Ireland's Tim Murtagh and Stuart Thompson were ranked 67th and 76th respectively in the Test bowling rankings.\nReactions.\nAfter the match, Pakistan's captain, Sarfaraz Ahmed, said that victory was very important and that the team was very confident in scoring the runs. He added that they were a very young side, but could chase the runs needed to win. He also praised the opposition's performance, saying \"the way they bowled, the way they batted, it’s not easy to play Ireland\". Ireland's captain, William Porterfield, said that despite losing he was extremely proud of how the team played, saying \"it was a hell of an effort\". He praised Kevin O'Brien's performance and added it was an all-round team effort. On Ireland's future in Test cricket, he added that he is \"very confident in the next generation\" and that there will be \"hundreds of kids aspiring to be Kevin O'Brien\". O'Brien said that he was very proud of his century, but was also disappointed that the team did not put Pakistan under more pressure.\nWarren Deutrom, CEO of Cricket Ireland, said \"this was a great success\" and that \"there were three things we were hoping for from this match; good crowds, good weather and competitive cricket\". Deutrom also commented on forthcoming fixtures for Ireland across the next four to five years in the Future Tours Programme (FTP), and improvements to facilities to prepare for these matches. Deutrom anticipates that Ireland will play one or two Tests a year, once the final fixtures in the FTP are agreed. Talking about the match, he said that despite the first day being washed out, Ireland were \"extremely competitive\" and he was \"delighted\" that they got to the final day still with a chance to win the match."

        "title": "Retired (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a batsman may retire from an innings at any time when the ball is dead; they must then be replaced by a teammate who has not been dismissed. The most common reason for retirement is if the batsman becomes injured or unwell, in which case they can resume their innings .\nRetirement is covered by Law 25 of the Laws of Cricket, which distinguishes between two types of retirement. If the batsman is ill or injured they are considered retired - not out and are permitted to return to batting if they recover. In all other cases the batsman is considered retired - out and may not return to the innings, unless the opposing captain offers an exemption. These two types of retirement are considered differently in cricket statistics.\nRetired - not out.\nIf a batting player becomes injured or falls ill (or some other exceptional circumstance forces them to leave the field), and they receive permission from the umpire, they may retire not out. If the retired batsman recovers before the end of the innings, they may resume batting, upon the dismissal or retirement of another batsman. If they cannot return to batting by the end of the innings, e.g. if they have been taken to hospital for medical treatment, the batting side must close its innings once it is all out i.e. has only one batsman who is not out and not retired. It is therefore possible for the innings to end despite the batting side only losing nine wickets (or fewer, if there are multiple retirements).\nThis situation is officially recorded on the scorecard as \"retired - not out\", though the unofficial term \"retired - hurt\" is often used on broadcasts instead. The batsman is considered 'not out' for statistical purposes e.g. when calculating a batting average.\nRetired - out.\nIf a batsman retires for any other reason, or without the umpire's permission, they are considered to have forfeited their wicket and are therefore out. Unless the opposing captain offers an exemption, the retired batsmen may not return. This situation is recorded on the scorecard as 'retired - out' and is considered a dismissal for statistical purposes, though is not credited to a bowler.\nExamples.\nAs of 2019, only two batsmen have retired out in a test match, and both instances occurred in the same innings: Sri Lankan batsmen Marvan Atapattu and Mahela Jayawardene both retired out in a match against Bangladesh in 2001. The decision was controversial, since they retired out to give the rest of the team batting practice, and this was considered unsporting.\nThe only example in Test cricket of an opposing captain granting an exemption was for Gordon Greenidge, during the fifth Test of the 1982–83 India–West Indies series. Greenidge was not out on a score of 154 overnight (his highest score in Tests to that point), when he received news that his two-year-old daughter was critically ill. He retired and flew from Antigua to Barbados to visit the hospital where his daughter was being treated; she died two days later. Greenidge took no further part in the match. As a mark of respect, he was recorded as \"retired not out\".\nIn Twenty20 (T20) cricket, teams sometimes retire a batsman for purely tactical reasons, such as to switch left- and right-handed batsmen, though this practice has been controversial and lambasted as unsporting. The first example at professional level was in a match between Bhutan and Maldives at the 2019 South Asian Games, when Sonam Tobgay of Bhutan retired out at the end of the 19th over. In the 2022 Indian Premier League, R Ashwin retired out while playing for Rajasthan Royals against Lucknow Super Giants. In June 2022, during the 2022 T20 Blast match between the Birmingham Bears and the Notts Outlaws, Carlos Brathwaite (Birmingham Bears) and Samit Patel (Notts Outlaws) both retired out for tactical reasons."

It was not as successful as he hoped, as few steelworkers were teetotalers, whilst the Darbys were great supporters of the temperance movement and so banned the sale of alcohol from their premises and land. The steelworkers later took over the Institute and managed it themselves. The institute supported cricket, rifle, tennis and bowls clubs, financed the silver band and supplied newspapers and magazines for the reading room.\nBrymbo Institute FC merged with local rivals Brymbo Green FC on 3 June 1921. The merger created a new club called Brymbo and Green United FC.

All other boats progress to the repechage round, which offers a second chance to qualify for the semi-finals. 2 unsuccessful boats from the repechage are eliminated from the competition.

        "title": "North Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "North Korea competed in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Pair skaters Ryom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik qualified for the Games, but the North Korean National Olympic Committee failed to enter them by the 30 October 2017 deadline. On 9 January 2018, North Korea agreed in negotiations with South Korea to send both athletes and a delegation to the Winter Olympics.\nThe teams representing North Korea and South Korea entered the Opening Ceremony marching under the Korean Unification Flag, while in women's ice hockey there was a single united Korean team.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors participating in the North Korean delegation per sport.\n Twelve members of the North Korea women's ice hockey team formed part of a unified Korea women's team which competed under a different country code (COR).\nLead up to the Games.\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) was keen for North Korean athletes to participate at the 2018 Winter Olympics. In order to increase their chances of qualification, the IOC offered to support them with equipment, accommodation, and travel to qualification events.\nNorth Korean short track speed skaters and cross-country skiers did not qualify for the Games. A wild card arrangement was considered for the eventuality that no North Korean athlete managed to qualify.\nThe host nation South Korea had proposed a unified team of the two Koreas at the Games. The team would participate at least in the women's ice hockey event and possibly more disciplines. North Korea rejected this proposal in June 2017 on the grounds of time constraints.\nSimilarly, South Korea had suggested that North Korea could co-host some of the skiing events at the Masikryong Ski Resort. This suggestion came after Moon Jae-in was elected President of South Korea in 2017. Earlier in December 2014, the organizers had denied the possibility of sharing any part of their bid with the North. Like the unified team proposal, the new co-hosting proposal was refused by the North. North Korea, however, supported South Korea's Olympic bid for the 2018 Games. This was unlike in 1988, when North Korea was willing to co-host the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, but once those plans had failed, it instead boycotted the Games and orchestrated the bombing of Korean Air Flight 858, in what is believed to have been an attempt to sabotage the Games.\nQualification.\nRyom Tae-ok and Kim Ju-sik qualified for the Games on 29 September 2017 at the 2017 CS Nebelhorn Trophy in Oberstdorf, Germany. Their successful free skating program was to the tune of \"\" by Ginette Reno, and their short program on the day before was to the music of The Beatles. They took one of the five available qualification spots for pair skaters at the event, as had previously been anticipated.\nThe qualification was seen as a positive development, since it could alleviate fears of the escalation of the 2017–18 North Korea crisis that might have otherwise jeopardized the Games.\nThe International Skating Union confirmed Ryom and Kim's qualification, but the North Korean National Olympic Committee still needed to approve their participation. Chang Ung, a North Korean member of the IOC, said he found this likely, adding: \"I am quite sure that politics is one thing and Olympics is another thing. So I don't see any big problem for the Pyeongchang Olympics.\" Despite this, the North Korean NOC failed to accept the two athletes by the deadline of 30 October.\nFailure to enter athletes.\nWhen the North Korean NOC failed to enter its only qualified athletes to the Games, North Korea's participation remained uncertain. The North Korean spot went to the runners up, Sumire Suto and Francis Boudreau-Audet representing Japan. They needed to accept the spot by 21 December 2017, which did not happen. North Korea could still have requested its quota be confirmed, in which case the IOC would have deliberated on the matter. An IOC spokesperson stated, \"[W]e would of course be flexible if they expressed a desire to come.\" A wild card option remained on the table.\nOrganizers of the Games did not expect the final decision on North Korea's participation to be made until the very last opportunity, and Moon Jae-in had given North Korea the chance to make the decision at any time before the start of the Games.\nHigh-level talks.\nThe impasse ended when North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un signaled in his New Year's speech for 2018, a possibility of sending athletes to the Games after all, saying \"North Korea's participation in the Winter Games will be a good opportunity to showcase the national pride and we wish the Games will be a success. Officials from the two Koreas may urgently meet to discuss the possibility\". The announcement was followed by South Korean agreement to participate in the first high-level talks with the North since December 2015; the talks were scheduled for 9 January 2018. North Korea was also prepared to talk to the IOC that week. In preparation for the North–South talks, the two countries restored the Seoul–Pyongyang hotline, which had been inactive for almost two years, and exchanged related documents via fax. After these developments, North Korea's IOC member Chang Ung said that the participation of North Korean figure skaters again looked likely. After the discussions on 9 January 2018, North Korea announced that they would send athletes to compete along with a delegation to attend the Winter Olympics.\nThese moves were met with public opposition in South Korea, including protests and online petitions; critics argued that the government was attempting to use the Olympics to spread pro-North Korean sentiment, and that the idea of a unified hockey team was ill-conceived. A rap video entitled \"The Regret for Pyeongchang\" (평창유감), echoing this criticism and labeling the event the \"Pyongyang Olympics\", went viral in the country. Japan's foreign affairs minister Tarō Kōno warned South Korea to be wary of North Korea's \"charm offensive\", and not to ease its pressure on the country.\nDiplomacy at the Games.\nThe athletes from North and South Korea marched under the Korean unification flag in the opening ceremony. South Korean Won Yun-jong and North Korean Hwang Chung-gum both held the flagpole.\nAs well as the athletes, North Korea sent an unprecedented high-level delegation, headed by Kim Yo-jong (sister of the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un) and President Kim Yong-nam, and including performers like the Samjiyon Orchestra. The delegation handed over an invitation to the South Korean President, Moon Jae-in, to visit North Korea.\nPresident Moon shook hands with Kim Yo-jong at the start of the Olympics. This was the first time since the Korean War that a member of the ruling Kim dynasty had visited South Korea. In contrast, US Vice President Mike Pence met North Korean defectors in PyeongChang joined by Fred Warmbier, whose son Otto died the year before after being released from North Korean captivity. American officials said that North Korea canceled a meeting with Pence at the last minute.\nThe apparent softening of relations between the two countries was marred by North Korea dispatching general Kim Yong-chol to head the North Korean delegation present at the closing ceremony. The arrival of Kim, held responsible by South Korea for the deaths of dozens of South Korean navy personnel, was met with hostility but the government did not oppose his presence at the Olympics. The general ended up being seated in the same stand as Ivanka Trump, the daughter of the US president.\nWomen's ice hockey tournament.\nIn January 2018, it was announced that the North Korean team would be amalgamated with a group of South Korean players to form a single Korean team in the women's ice hockey tournament. In this unified team, at least three North Korean players were to be selected for each game. The South Korea women's national ice hockey team qualified as the host."

        "text": "George Holland (born 11 November 1918) was an Australian tennis player. In 1938, tennis legend Don Budge said that, among the younger and less prominent players he had seen on his trip to Australia, Holland had the brightest future. \"I have selected him after careful study of most of the leading young players. I watched many of them in match play during the Australian championships when they did not know I was about\" said Budge, in an article in \"The Sydney Morning Herald\" on 14 February 1938. Budge went on to describe Holland's game by saying \"he has a forceful service, hits his ground strokes with freedom and likes to chase them to the net, where he volleys and smashes severely, with just a dash of drop-volleys thrown in occasionally. And he possesses a splendid temperament. I summed him up as a clear-thinking lad with a heart as big as his happy outlook on life\". George Holland made his debut in the Australian championships in 1937 and lost to Arthur Huxley in round one. At the 1938 Australian championships, 19 year old Holland beat Huxley 10–8 in the fifth set in round one. Then in round two Holland caused a big upset by beating reigning French champion and third ranked player in the world Henner Henkel after losing the first 2 sets. From the third set onwards, Holland \"followed everything to the net and made some glorious volleys\" and was in command of the match. \"His groundstrokes had more penetration, he rarely missed his first serve, and he treated Henkel's cannon-balls in cavalier fashion to take command of the attack\" according to \"The Argus\". In the quarter-finals, Holland lost in four sets to Adrian Quist. In the first round of the 1939 Australian championships, Holland lost in round one to Vivian McGrath in straight sets. During World War II, Holland reached the rank of Lieutenant. After the war, Holland resumed his tennis career."

        "text": "The 1968 Winter Olympics, officially known as the \"X Olympic Winter Games\", was a winter multi-sport event held in Grenoble, France, from 6 to 18 February 1968. A total of 1,158 athletes representing 37 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 35 events from 10 different sports and disciplines. The Olympic programme was largely unchanged from four years prior in Innsbruck; one event was added, a relay event in biathlon.\nNorway won the most medals, with 14, and the most gold medals with 6. The Soviet Union finished second in both tallies, with 5 golds and 13 medals in total. Of the 37 NOCs to participate at Grenoble, 15 won at least one medal, with 13 of those winning at least one gold medal. East and West Germany entered separate teams for the first time, having competed together in the three prior Winter Olympics. Both nations won gold medals, their first competing as different nations. Czechoslovakia won its first gold Winter Olympics medal, achieved by Jiří Raška in the ski jumping normal hill event. Romania won its first, and as of the 2018 Winter Olympics, only medal in a Winter Olympics in the two-man bobsleigh event.\nJean-Claude Killy of France was the most successful athlete at these games, winning all three of the men's alpine skiing events. Two other athletes each won three medals: Sweden's Toini Gustafsson earned two golds and a silver, and Finland's Eero Mäntyranta won a silver and two bronzes. Both of them were competitors in cross-country skiing. Four other athletes—Luciano de Paolis, Ole Ellefsæter, Harald Grønningen, and Eugenio Monti—won two gold medals, and 29 individuals in total won at least two medals in Grenoble. In speed skating, three different events ended with ties for the silver medal position, one, the women's 500 metres ended in a three-way tie for silver. In all three cases, multiple silver medals and no bronze medals were awarded. In figure skating, American Peggy Flemming won the gold medal in ladies' singles; this came a mere seven years after the 1961 crash of Sabena Flight 548 that killed the entire US figure skating team.\nMultiple medalists.\nAthletes who won three medals or two gold medals during the 1968 Winter Olympics are listed below."

        "text": "Erin Matson (born March 17, 2000) is an American former field hockey player and the current head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels field hockey team. A standout player on that team from 2018 to 2022, she led the Tar Heels to win four NCAA Championships.\nMatson is one of only two players to be selected in the U.S. Women's National Team at age 16; the first was Katie Bam, selected in 2005.\nEarly life.\nMatson grew up in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, and started playing field hockey in 2006. Her mother, Jill, played field hockey and softball at Yale, and her father, Brian, played baseball at Delaware. Matson played as a midfielder and graduated from Unionville High School in 2018. In high school, she committed to play collegiate field hockey at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, under head coach Karen Shelton.\nCollege career.\nIn the fall of 2018, Matson made her debut in Chapel Hill, and over the course of her time there, became one of the most decorated athletes in North Carolina Tar Heels history, with career achievements rivaling those of Michael Jordan, Mia Hamm, and Tyler Hansbrough. While at North Carolina, she won the Honda Sports Award three times, being recognized as the nation's top collegiate field hockey player in 2019, 2020, and 2022. She won four NCAA Championships as a player (2018, 2019, 2020, and 2022), and five ACC titles in her five seasons in Chapel Hill. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the NCAA granted all student-athletes an extra year of eligibility, which Matson used to return to Carolina for a fifth playing season in 2022. Matson was recognized as the ACC Player of the Year and ACC Offensive Player of the Year every season she played at Carolina.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing Karen Shelton's retirement in December 2022, and just a month after her own graduation from UNC, Matson was named the Tar Heels' head coach on January 31, 2023. In a move that paralleled Shelton's own hiring 42 years prior (Shelton was 23 when she became head coach) Matson became the Tar Heels' head coach at the age of 22. Matson inherited a defending national championship team made up of many of her former teammates. On November 19, 2023, the Tar Heels won the NCAA field hockey national championship, their 5th title in 6 years, making Matson the second youngest NCAA Division I coach in history to win a national championship just two months older than Myron Roderick at the time of their respective NCAA team championships.\nCareer highlights.\nMatson was part of the United States team at the 2016–17 Hockey World League Semifinals in Johannesburg, South Africa. In the final, Matson scored the winning goal in a penalty shootout against Germany. Matson has represented the US in four other international competitions in her career, the first being the 2014 Youth Indoor Pan American Games."
