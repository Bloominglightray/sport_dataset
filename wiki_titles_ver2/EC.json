The team played its home games in the Crisler Arena in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and was a member of the Big Ten Conference. Under the direction of first-year head coach Bill Frieder, the team finished tied for sixth in the Big Ten Conference. The team earned an invitation to the 1981 National Invitation Tournament. Although the team was ranked in the Associated Press Top Twenty Poll for eleven of the sixteen weeks reaching a peak at number nine, it began and finished the season unranked and it also ended the season unranked in the final UPI Coaches' Poll. The team was led by All-American Mike McGee. The team set the current Big Ten conference record by playing in six overtime games. That season McGee also set the current conference record for career field goals attempted (2077). McGee set several other records, which have since been broken: career points (2439, broken in 1989 by Glen Rice), career points (conference games only) (1503, broken in 1995), single-season field goals made (309, broken in 1986) and career field goals made (1010, broken in 1993). Mark Bodnar became the first Michigan Wolverines player on record to total 13 assists in a game on December 13, 1980, against the , eclipsing Mark Henry's 1970 total of 12. No Wolverine would surpass 13 assists in a game until Gary Grant twice recorded 14 in December 1987. The team's field goal percentage of 51.1 was a school record that lasted four years. McGee's 3941 minutes and 34.3 minutes per game stood as school records until 1987 and 1984 respectively. Marty Bodnar earned first team Academic All-American honors, while Mark Bodnar was a third team selection. Paul Heuerman and Thad Garner served as team captains, while McGee earned team MVP. McGee ended his career with a school record 112 starts. The record would last for six years.\nIn the 32-team National Invitation Tournament, Michigan advanced to the elite eight round by defeating the 74–58 and 80–68 before losing to 91–76.\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nSeven players from this team were selected in the NBA draft."

It was probably laid out on an area known as Comparts Meadow to the south of the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, an area that had been built over by 1881 and now forms part of Gillingham. The only other match recorded as taking place on the ground was a non-first-class match in 1894 when Chatham Cricket Club played the touring South African side, although this is likely to have taken place elsewhere on the Lines.\nOther cricket matches are known to have been played on the Chatham Lines, with matches recorded as early as 1773.

Subsequently, the Tridents lost their second divisional fixture to UM RFC and ended their inaugural season 1-1.\nOn Wednesday, September 7, 2016, the Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez alongside Commissioner Jose \"Pepe\" Diaz recognized the team following an undefeated season by proclaiming September 7 \"Trident Rugby Football Club Day\" in Miami-Dade County. A great honor that was followed by the first ever lineout performed inside City Hall.\nToday, the Tridents continue to play rugby in Miami as a member of the Florida Rugby Union.\nTours.\nBahamas - 1978\nPractices.\nDuring regular season, usually October through April, practices are held at Athalie Range Park in the City of Miami Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30PM – 9:30 PM.\nMatches.\nHome matches are typically played on Saturdays at 2pm throughout autumn, winter, and spring. \nA current schedule of matches is published on the club's website.\nSponsors.\nThe Tridents Sponsorship List"

        "text": "The 1946–47 Holy Cross Crusaders men's basketball team represented the College of the Holy Cross, located in Worcester, Massachusetts, in NCAA competition in the 1946–47 season. The Crusaders, behind coach Alvin \"Doggie\" Julian, NCAA tournament MVP George Kaftan, star Joe Mullaney and a freshman point guard named Bob Cousy, beat Oklahoma at Madison Square Garden to win the NCAA championship.\nThe Crusaders, who played their home games at Boston Garden and the South High Community School in Worcester, Massachusetts, won their first four games of 1946-47, tripped through a three-game losing streak, then finished the year with 23 straight victories.\nThe team entered the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament as the last seed in the 8-team tournament. In the first match, Holy Cross defeated the United States Naval Academy in front of a sold-out crowd at Madison Square Garden by a score of 55 to 47. Mullaney led the team in scoring with 18 points, mostly in part to Navy coach Ben Carnevale's decision to have his players back off from Mullaney, who was reputed as being more of a playmaker than a shooter. In the semi-final match, Holy Cross faced the City College of New York (CCNY), coached by Nat Holman, one of the game's earliest innovators. The Crusaders, led by Kaftan's 30-point game, easily defeated the Beavers 60–45. In the championship game, Holy Cross faced the University of Oklahoma, behind coach Bruce Drake, in another sold-out game at Madison Square Garden. Kaftan followed up the semi-final match with 18 points in the title game, leading the Crusaders to a 58–47 victory against the Sooners.\nHoly Cross became the first school from the New England area, as well as the state of Massachusetts, to win a national college basketball title. The Crusaders finished the 1947 season with 23 straight wins. Afterward, 35,000 people watched a parade in the team's honor on Holy Cross Day in Worcester. Future NBA legend Cousy was named AP and UP player of the year, and George Kaftan was voted to the all-decade team of the 1940s by the NCAA in 1989.\nNCAA tournament results.\n\"Source\""

        "text": "Robert Blake Williams (October 18, 1924 – November 11, 2003) was an American basketball player. He won two national championships at Oklahoma A&amp;M University and represented the U.S. as a member of the 1950 FIBA World Championship in Buenos Aires, Argentina. \nWilliams, a 6'2 guard from Lawton, Oklahoma, attended Oklahoma A&amp;M (subsequently renamed Oklahoma State Univ.) from 1944–48, winning championships with the Aggies in both 1945 and 1946 with future Hall of Fame teammate Bob Kurland. The Aggies were coached by future US Olympic team coach, Henry Iba. Williams was named first team All-Missouri Valley Conference in 1946, in a year when all five Aggie starters composed the all-conference first team.\nFollowing the completion of his collegiate career, Williams opted to compete in the Amateur Athletic Union, instead of the fledgling professional leagues, the National Basketball Association or the Basketball Association of America. He joined the Denver Chevrolets, a move that enabled him to become a part of the U.S. National team's entry to the first FIBA World Championship in 1950 in Buenos Aires.\nWilliams played in all six of the team's matches as the team won their first five games to reach the final against host team Argentina. In the final the U.S. team lost 64-50 as 38 fouls were called on the Americans and Argentina tallied more points from the foul line than from the field. The U.S. team had only four players on the floor at the end of the game. Williams averaged 3.3 points per game for the tournament, with his best game coming in the fourth contest against Chile when Williams led the Americans in scoring with nine points.\nWilliams went on to a career in automobile sales, eventually owning a small Ford dealership in Newcastle, Wyoming. He retired from that business in 1980 and spent his final decades in Fort Collins, Colorado. He died from diabetes complications in 2003, leaving behind his wife of 54 years, Florence Williams, and three children."

The competition is organized and held by the Professional Darts Corporation, with the 2010 edition having a maximum prize fund of £189,000.\nThe format of the tournament is similar to the Premier League Darts tournament, also organized by the PDC, except it is contested by a larger pool of players who are split up into a number of groups.\nEvery match could be watched on one of the ten bookmaker websites who broadcast the competition. The tournament was available globally through the internet, except in the United States of America where it cannot be shown for legal reasons.\nFormat.\nThe first group consisted of the top eight players from the PDC Order of Merit who were available for the competition. These eight players played each other over the course of a day, receiving two points for each win. All matches were contested over a maximum of 11 legs with a player winning the match on reaching 6 legs. After all players had played each other, the four players with the most points progressed to the semi-finals with the winners of those matches progressing into the final.\nThe winner of the final progressed to the winners group which took place at the end of the competition. The runner-up, losing semi-finalists and the players finishing fifth and sixth moved into group two, where they were joined by the next three players in the Order of Merit.

        "text": "Richard Graham (born 5 August 1972) is a rugby union coach and former head coach of the Australian Super Rugby franchises, the Queensland Reds and Western Force.\nEarly life.\nRichard Graham was born in central western Queensland (Charleville). He also lived in (Miles), (Mitchell), (Hughenden), (Longreach) and (Rockhampton).\nHe attended Marist College Ashgrove as a boarding student and was a talented schoolboy sportsman. Graham played 1st XI Cricket, captained 1st XV Rugby and captained the school athletics team. In his final year at school, Graham won the TAS 110m hurdles. Former Wallabies Daniel Herbert, Graeme Bond and Pat Howard were part of Graham's 1st XV in 1990. Graham played for the undefeated Australian Schoolboys Rugby Union team that toured Europe in 1990/91 with the likes of Matt Burke, Peter Jorgensen, Jacob Rauluni and Scott Bowen.\nPlaying career.\nRichard Graham played a year of Colts rugby at the GPS Rugby Club and was awarded the Queensland Colt of the Year in 1991. The following year saw Graham suffer a badly broken leg and subsequently a number of seasons away from the game. In 1995 he changed clubs and began playing for the Easts RFC in Brisbane winning the 1997 Brisbane premiership and also the 1999 Brisbane premiership as captain. He made his debut for the Queensland Reds against Hong Kong in 1998 and in 2001 played for Australia A against the touring British and Irish Lions. It was as a Rugby 7s player however that Graham was best known. He played for and captained the Australian Rugby 7s team between 1998 and 2002, his teams won 5 IRB series events and he attended 2 Commonwealth Games – 1998 (Kuala Lumpur) and 2002 (Manchester).

In his 4 seasons with the club, he also worked under John Connolly (former Wallaby coach) and Brian Ashton (former England coach). Graham then moved to the Saracens RFC, where he worked under Alan Gaffney (former assistant Wallaby and Ireland coach) and Eddie Jones (former Wallaby coach) before finishing as head coach in 2009. In June 2009 Graham joined Robbie Deans as skills coach of the National team. While in this role he also accepted a position of assistant coach to former All Blacks coach John Mitchell at the Western Force. When Mitchell unexpectedly joined the Lions in Johannesburg in September 2010 Graham was promoted to head coach a year earlier than anticipated. On 16 April 2012 Graham was sacked as coach of the Western Force after he announced he would be joining the Reds to become head coach in 2013. After two games into the 2016 Super Rugby season Graham and the Queensland Reds parted ways. In June 2016 Richard Graham was appointed coaching coordinator for the Georgia Rugby Union national side.\nEducation.\nFollowing his schooling at Marist College, Richard Graham completed a Bachelor of Education degree.

The trophy used to be known as the Northern Union Challenge Cup.\nIt is the oldest rugby league competition in New Zealand.\nHistory.\nNew Zealand rugby league was born with events such as the All Golds tour of England, and matches in Wellington and Auckland in 1908. John Coffey writes in \"Te Ara\", \"The Auckland Rugby League was formed in July 1909, and North Shore played City as the forerunner to an inter-club competition that started in 1910. By this time, league was also being played in Taranaki, Rotorua, Hawke’s Bay, Nelson, Marlborough and Southland.\"\nThe Cup was made in Bradford and donated to Auckland for inter-provincial competition by the touring 1910 Great Britain Lions.\nThe Cup was first contested in 1911, when Auckland successfully defended it four times. The Cup was held by Auckland until 1922.\nAuckland are the current holders of the Cup after they defeated Canterbury in a one-off match on 4 June 2012. This was marked as a \"centennial\" match."

They lost all these matches and as a result Wisden decided not to accord them first class status in the following year. However they also played three non first class matches against Essex and Leicestershire and won all three.\nThe captain for the year was William Chatterton who also played for MCC during the season. The top scorer was George Davidson who also took most wickets.\nDuring the season Derbyshire played their first home fixture away from the County Ground, when they played Lancashire at the Recreation Ground, Long Eaton. This was the only occasion on which they used the venue.\nTwo important players made their debut in the season whose performance came to the fore once Derbyshire regained first-class status. They were John Hulme who took over 550 wickets for Derbyshre and Bill Storer who was one of the club's long-serving wicket-keepers. Harry Bagshaw who also made his debut gave the club many years service. Other players who made their debut were George Ratcliffe, Joseph Marshall, Henry Street and William Walton. None of these had the chance to play first class cricket for Derbyshire again although some appeared occasionally for the club in the intervening years.\nA number of players appeared for Derbyshire for the last time this season. These included Edmund Maynard a former captain and George Barrington who had both joined in 1880. Also departing were Henry Slater who had been a member of the side since 1882 and Edwin Coup who had joined the club in 1885. In addition Thomas Mycroft a stand-in wicket-keeper who had made occasional appearances since 1877 played his last game. Several cricketers continued playing for Derbyshire but had stopped playing by the time the club reached first class status again in 1894. These were James Disney wicket-keeper since 1881, George Ratcliffe, Joseph Marshall, William Walton, three of the players who made their debut in 1887 and William Cropper who died in 1889 as a result of an unfortunate football accident.\nStatistics.\nFirst-class batting averages.\nChatterton also played five matches for MCC during the season.\n(a) Figures recalculated to exclude non Derbyshire matches\nFirst-class bowling averages.\n(a) Figures recalculated to exclude non Derbyshire matches"

        "text": "The 1960–61 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team represented the University of Michigan in intercollegiate college basketball during the 1960–61 season. The team played its home games at Fielding H. Yost Field House (renamed Yost Ice Arena in 1973) on the school's campus in Ann Arbor, Michigan.\nSeason overview.\nUnder the direction of first-year head coach Dave Strack, the team compiled 6–18 record (2–12 in conference games), finished tenth in the Big Ten Conference and failed to get an invitation to either the 1961 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament or the 1961 National Invitation Tournament. Over the course of the season, the team lost to both ranked opponents that it faced. Although it had a 6–6 record at home, it lost all 12 of its road games.\nAfter two road losses to Vanderbilt and Tennessee to open the season, Michigan returned to Yost Field House and won its home opener over Pittsburgh, 86–70, on December 6, 1960. Team captain and senior, John Tidwell led Michigan's scoring with 38 points.\nOn February 2, 1961, Michigan tallied its highest point total of the year and easily defeated Western Ontario, 88–58, in a non-conference home game. All 13 Michigan players saw action against Western Ontario, a team that was \"rated as Canada's best.\" Tidwell led the team in scoring with 28 points, and Tom Cole led the way on the boards with 13 rebounds. The team set a Michigan single-game record with 72 rebounds against Western Ontario, but the record would be broken exactly two years later when the current record of 77 was set.\nTwo days after its victory over the Canadians, Michigan suffered its worst loss of the season, losing at home to an undefeated and No. 1 ranked Ohio State team by a score of 80–58. The game was played in front of a crowd of 6,000 fans and a regional television audience. The \"Associated Press\" wrote, \"The fabulous Buckeys, now 16–0 for the season and 6–0 in the Big Ten, dispatched the conference cellar dwellers with an adding machine offense.\"\nMichigan's second worst loss of the season came on the road against Purdue, 96–79, on February 6, 1961. Four Michigan players fouled out of the game, as the Wolverines were called for 58 personal fouls. Purdue converted 40 of 48 free throw attempts. Michigan's leading scorer, Tidwell, was among the four Wolverines to foul out, and he finished the game with only one point.\nOn February 13, 1961, Michigan won its first Big Ten Conference game, defeating Michigan State 78–67 in front of a season-high crowd of 6,500 at Yost Field House. In the battle of in-state rivals, the Wolverines' center, Scott Maentz of East Grand Rapids, was the only Michigan-born player to start for either team. Michigan's Tom Cole was the high scorer with 29 points. Maentz, who also played end for the Michigan football team, scored 19 points and pulled in 18 rebounds.\nOn March 4, 1961, Tidwell established a Big Ten Conference single-game record by making 20 field goals in a 73–70 loss against . Tidwell also broke his own Michigan single-game scoring record with 43 points in the loss to Minnesota. Tidwell's Big Ten record of 20 field goals stood until February 16, 1963, when Jimmy Rayl posted 23 for Indiana.\nOn March 6, 1961, in the final home game of the season, Michigan won only its second conference game, defeating Illinois, 74–66. Scott Maentz led a second-half rally that put the Wolverines on top. After a slow start with two points in the first half, Maentz scored 16 points in the second half before fouling out with six minutes left in the game. Tidwell, playing in his final home game in front of a crowd of 3,000, led Michigan's scorers with 24 points. Tidwell set nearly every Michigan scoring record, and when he was pulled from the game, he was \"given a three-minute, standing ovation for his effort.\"\nOn March 11, 1961, Michigan closed its season with an 82–67 loss to Indiana in Bloomington. The season-ending loss to Indiana is notable in that the two teams set a National Collegiate Athletic Association single-game record that still stands with 152 total rebounds, 95 by Indiana and 57 for Michigansted 57 rebounds, while Indiana posted 95. Indiana's Walt Bellamy led the effort with 33 rebounds to break his own Indiana record.\nAt the conclusion of the season, the members of the team chose Tidwell as the team's Most Valuable Player. Tidwell scored 441 points for a 19.2 point average during his senior year. Tidwell became the first Wolverine to end his career with a 20-point per game scoring average, and his career point total (1,386) eclipsed the school scoring record set by Ron Kramer in 1957 (1,119). Bill Buntin broke Tidwell's scoring record in 1965 with 1,725 points and a 21.8 point per game average.\nPlayer statistics.\nThe following player statistics are taken from the University of Michigan's Men's Basketball Statistic Archive Query Page.\nTeam players drafted into the NBA.\nOne player from this team were selected in the NBA draft."

        "text": "William John Gibson (December 18, 1927 – July 23, 1975) was an American basketball coach who was the head men's basketball coach at the University of Virginia and the University of South Florida.\nBiography.\nBorn in Donora, Pennsylvania, Gibson played basketball at Penn State University, graduating in 1952. After a four-year period of coaching high school basketball, he began his college head coaching career at Mansfield University of Pennsylvania in the 1956–57 season. In seven seasons, Mansfield posted a 102–37 win–loss record under Gibson, including a 57–3 record over the final three seasons he coached at the school. In April 1963, Virginia named him its men's basketball coach; at the time, the Cavaliers were struggling to compete in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Virginia was 8–16 in Gibson's first season as coach and did not win 10 games in a season until 1968–69.\nThe Cavaliers lost in the ACC tournament's first round (the tenth consecutive season Virginia had exited the tournament at that stage), and Gibson faced a \"revolt\" at the hands of his own players. They petitioned against Gibson, and met with Virginia's athletic director, a group of faculty, and Gibson himself. The university retained Gibson following the meetings, and the players' complaints were not mentioned in Virginia's statement to the press, though the Associated Press said they were related to \"Gibson's tactics and handling of players.\"\nThe Cavaliers went 10–15 in 1969–70, but the team showed signs of improvement in its closing games. After an upset win over Duke to close the regular season, Virginia defeated North Carolina in the ACC tournament for its first win in the event in 11 years. The Cavaliers had a 15–11 record in 1970–71, and at one point achieved a top 20 national ranking. The following season, Virginia won 18 of its first 19 games, including a stretch of 12 consecutive victories, and reached a peak of sixth in the Associated Press Poll. The team tied for second in the ACC with an 8–4 record in conference play; it was the first time the Cavaliers had more wins than losses in ACC competition, and they were the first Virginia team to be in the top 20 of the Associated Press Poll at the end of the regular season. After the season, in which Virginia had an overall record of 21–7, Gibson was selected as ACC Men's Basketball Coach of the Year.\nIn March 1974, he accepted an offer to coach at South Florida. Four months later, he had a heart attack and was hospitalized. Gibson recovered and his South Florida team had a 15–10 record in 1974–75. On July 23, 1975, he died of what was reported as a likely second heart attack."

        "title": "Indoor triathlon",
        "text": "An indoor triathlon is a nonstandard variation of the triathlon and consists of three events: swimming, cycling, and running. The swim is held in an indoor pool, the cycling takes place on stationary bikes, and the run takes place on an indoor track or treadmill. Indoor triathlons are generally held in fitness clubs to accommodate all three sports.\nIn some competitions participants are judged by the distance they travel in each event in a set amount of time. Times can vary between races. On other occasions, the triathlon is conducted in the same manner as an outdoor triathlon in that distances are set and participants compete to finish the total distance in the shortest amount of time. Generally, the swimming is the shortest event, and cycling is the longest. Occasionally, transition time will not be factored into the overall scoring. In one example, participants are given about 5 minutes to transition between events.\nAn indoor triathlon has several advantages when compared to an outdoor triathlon. Indoor triathlons are a way to compete during the winter, as well as a way to be introduced to the sport without facing an open water swim. They also do not require an investment in a bicycle, as the bike portion is on a supplied stationary bike. Finally, they also allow participants that may not be able to complete a set distance but that could \"race\" for a set period of time to compete.\nThe first indoor triathlons were held in stadiums and velodromes in Europe and Asia in the late 1980s as showcase events for the top professionals where a temporary pool would be built in the center and the bike and run would be around the track. These were invitation-only spectator events with qualifying heats and a final race for professional triathletes and were not open to the general public. Unlike the current format of indoor triathlons, these races did not have a short break between events, so transitions were an important element of the race. Borrowing from that concept, the first editions of the current version of the indoor triathlon were staged in the early 1990s in Ontario, Canada. There a group of 4 triathlete friends created an indoor series based out of the 4 different universities they attended (University of Western Ontario, MacMaster University, Queens University and Trent University). The races consisted of a 15-minute indoor pool swim followed by a 5-minute break to get from pool to bikes followed by a 15-minute bike on a stationary bike followed by a 5-minute break to get from bikes to the track followed by a 15-minute run on an indoor track. The events were held with participants going in waves over the course of a morning. Participants were scored based on point scale where you could achieve up to 1,000 points in each sport based on how far you went in the 15 minutes. In contrast to the original professionally focused indoor races, the purpose of this series was to create a low cost, fun, safe and unstressful way to initiate newcomers to the sport of triathlon. These races sold out quickly, and the series expanded to other universities and the Ontario InterUniversity Triathlon Association (OITA) was born to oversee it. As triathlon's popularity grew in the 90s, other indoor triathlon races began appearing across North America and the world using a similar format to the OITA races."

For the next few decades, the Yew Street cricket ground rivalled Old Trafford as the focal point for Lancashire cricket and between 1856 and 1863, the ground held 6 first-class matches for the North, the last of which saw them play the South in 1863. The Gentlemen of the North used the ground in 1858 when they played the Gentlemen of the South, and once more in 1860 against the same opposition. A bowls section was formed in the 1860s, followed by lacrosse in 1875. After purchasing Yew Street from the Clowes Estate in the 1920s, Broughton Cricket Club added sections for hockey and tennis, and in 1945, rugby union.\nThe final recorded match held on the ground for over 130 years came in 1880 when Broughton played the touring Australians during their 1880 tour of England. Shortly after this match, part of the ground was sold for development, the ground was split into two parts and became mainly known as the home of Broughton Rugby Union Football Club. As of the early 21st century, the ground was still being used for local grassroots cricket, mainly for local teams playing in the Greater Manchester Amateur Cricket League."

        "title": "Boxing judge",
        "text": "A boxing judge is responsible for judging the results of a boxing match, with as many as three judges typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches that connect, defense, knockdowns, and other, more subjective, measures. At the Olympic or World championship level, there are usually five judges.\nA boxing match that has not ended in a knockout, technical knockout (TKO) or disqualification (DQ), having reached the limit on the preset number of rounds has \"gone the distance\" and the fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous decisions and split decisions are possible, as are draws. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, fights may end with controversial results, in which one of the fighters may believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. A draw will result if all three judges call the fight even or if one judge favors one fighter, a second judge's card supports the other and the third calls the fight a draw. The March 1999 heavyweight unification bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis at Madison Square Garden is an example of a draw where all three judges had scored the fight differently, with Eugenia Williams favoring Holyfield, Stanley Christodoulou favoring Lewis and Larry O'Connell calling the fight a draw. The result led to calls for an immediate rematch between the two fighters. The extremely rare majority draw results when two out of the three judges call the fight even, which means the fight will be called a draw regardless if the third judge favors one fighter. There are some scoring systems used in boxing that make it impossible for a judge to award equal points for a match. If a championship bout ends in a draw, the champion usually retains the title.\nBoxing had always traditionally been a sport for males, with men performing the officiating. The first female boxing judge, Carol Polis, was appointed in 1973. Eva Shain, appointed as a judge a year after Polis by the New York State Athletic Commission, became the first woman to judge a heavyweight title fight, when she was one of three judges officiating as Earnie Shavers fought Muhammad Ali at Madison Square Garden on September 29, 1977."

        "text": "The Army Black Knights men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the United States Military Academy. The Black Knights are a member of Atlantic Hockey and play at the Tate Rink in West Point, New York.\nHistory.\nThe men's ice hockey program at West Point has been in existence since the 1903–04 season. The team played outdoors until 1930 when the Smith Rink opened. The team competed as independent members of NCAA Division I from the inaugural season through the 1960–61 season. In 1961 the program became a founding member of the ECAC. The team, known at the time as the Army Cadets, played as members of the ECAC from 1961 to 1962 season through the 1972–73 season before dropping their program to Division II status when the NCAA instituted numerical divisions. The Cadets would remain there until 1980 when they rejoined the ECAC as an associate member. Army became a full ECAC member in 1984 in the aftermath of the Hockey East schism but the Cadets wouldn't remain for long and left the conference in 1990. The Cadets joined the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference (MAAC), which began sponsoring men's hockey at the time, in 1999 and in 2001 the team name was changed to Army Black Knights along with the other athletic programs at the Academy. In 2003, the MAAC's ice hockey division split off and became the Atlantic Hockey Association, a hockey-only NCAA Division I conference.\nIn 2007–08 season the Black Knights won their only conference title to date, the Atlantic Hockey Regular Season Championship. In that season the Knights finished with an overall record of 19 wins, 14 losses, and 4 ties and went 17–8–3 in conference play. Took the No. 1 seed into the Atlantic Hockey playoffs and swept (#10) American Int'l two games to none in the three game first round series. The Black Knight's season came to an end in the semifinal game when they lost to (#5) Mercyhurst 2–4.\nSince 1950, the Cadets/Black Knights have been coached by a member of the Riley family. Jack Riley, best known for leading the United States to the gold medal at the 1960 Winter Olympics, coached at West Point from 1950 to 1986. He handed the reins to his son Rob in 1986, who in turn handed coaching duties to his younger brother Brian in 2004.\nArmy–RMC rivalry.\nThe Army Black Knights have a long-standing rivalry with the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) Paladins. It is considered one of the longest-running annual international sporting events in the world.\nThe tradition originated when the commandant of RMC, Sir Archibald McDonnell, and the superintendent of the U.S. Military Academy, Brigadier General Douglas MacArthur, suggested a game of ice hockey between the two schools in 1921. After two years of exchanging ideas, the first game was played on February 23, 1923, at West Point. The Redmen won that first game 3–0. In 1924 the series moved to Kingston, Ontario (the location of RMC), thus beginning the tradition of rotating venues. This was Army's first away game and up until 1941, the West Point Game was the only time that Army played away from the Academy.\nAwards.\nU.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.\nThe following individuals have been inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\nIIHF Hall of Fame.\nThe following individuals have been inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame.\nArmy Sports Hall of Fame.\nThe following individuals have been inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame.\nLester Patrick Award.\nThe following individuals have been awarded the Lester Patrick Award.\nNCAA.\nIndividual awards.\nSpencer Penrose Award\nLowes' Senior CLASS Award\nDerek Hines Unsung Hero Award\nNCAA Scoring Champion\nAll-Americans.\nAHCA Second Team All-Americans\nMAAC.\nIndividual awards.\nOffensive Player of the Year\nGoaltender of the Year\nDefensive Rookie of the Year\nAll–MAAC teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team \nRookie Team\nAtlantic Hockey.\nIndividual awards.\nPlayer of the Year\nRookie of the Year\nBest Defenseman\nIndividual Sportsmanship Award\nRegular Season Scoring Trophy\nRegular Season Goaltending Award\nCoach of the Year\nAll-Atlantic Hockey Teams.\nFirst Team\nSecond Team\nThird Team\nRookie Team\nStatistical leaders.\nCareer scoring leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; G = Goals; A = Assists; Pts = Points; PIM = Penalty minutes\"\nCareer goaltending leaders.\n\"GP = Games played; Min = Minutes played; GA = Goals against; SO = Shutouts; SV% = Save percentage; GAA = Goals against average\"\nOlympians.\nThis is a list of Army alumni were a part of an Olympic team."

        "text": "Robert Stevens (November 11, 1923 – September 29, 2012) was an American basketball coach. He was the head men's basketball coach at the University of South Carolina and the University of Oklahoma. From 1959–60 to 1966–67, he posted a combined 80–124 win–loss record at the two schools.\nBiography.\nRaised in Warsaw, Indiana, Stevens attended Sidney High School before going to college at the University of Michigan and Michigan State University; he played on the men's basketball team at Michigan State and graduated from the university in 1949. In World War II and the Korean War, Stevens served in the United States Marine Corps. He coached at Indiana's Milford High School before receiving his first collegiate job from Michigan State. Stevens spent three seasons coaching the university's freshman team, and was then promoted to an assistant position on the varsity team. After three seasons in that position, he was hired as head coach at South Carolina in 1959. The Gamecocks were 10–16 in 1959–60, Stevens' first head coaching season. Following 1960–61, a season in which the team had a 9–17 record, South Carolina improved to 15–12 in 1961–62, and Stevens earned the Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year award.\nIn April 1962, Stevens left South Carolina to become Oklahoma's men's basketball coach. In the five seasons that he coached the Sooners, the team did not post a winning record. Oklahoma's best record during this time came in Stevens' first season there, 1962–63, when the Sooners went 12–13. Reportedly \"under pressure\" after the 1966–67 season, Stevens resigned in April 1967. During his career, he was known for employing attacking, fast break offensive tactics. Later in his life, Stevens had a 20-year stint as leader of the Waterford Athletic Club, and was an assistant coach for the Continental Basketball Association's Oklahoma City Cavalry.\nOn September 29, 2012, Stevens died in a boating accident."

        "text": "In basketball, a block (short for blocked shot) occurs when a defender deflects or stops a field goal attempt without committing a foul. The top 25 highest blocks totals in NCAA Division I men's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". Blocks are a relatively new statistic in college basketball, having only become an official statistic beginning with the 1985–86 season.\nMany well-known players, such as Hall of Famers Ralph Sampson, David Robinson and Hakeem Olajuwon accumulated college block totals that would have placed them in the top 25 all-time if they had not played before blocks were a recognized statistic. Olajuwon played for Houston and accumulated 454 blocks in his three-year career. Robinson, meanwhile, evenly split his four-year career at Navy between the pre-block and the recognized-block statistical eras. For his entire college career, Robinson recorded 516 blocks, but since only his junior and senior seasons' block totals are officially recognized, his two-year sum of 351 blocks does not even rank in the top 25 all-time. Jarvis Varnado of Mississippi State, therefore, holds the Division I record for career blocks with 564. He played for the Bulldogs from 2006–07 through 2009–10 and surpassed Wojciech Myrda's mark of 535 during his senior season. Although Varnado ended with 29 more blocks than Myrda, it took him 26 more games—nearly the amount of a complete season—to finish with that total.\nTwo of the top eight shot blockers played college basketball for only three seasons. Adonal Foyle of Colgate recorded 492 blocks in just 87 career games before he left one season early for the National Basketball Association (NBA). Foyle would get drafted 8th overall by the Golden State Warriors in the 1997 NBA draft. Meanwhile, Shawn James played in 83 games while registering 443 blocks. James played for two seasons at Northeastern before transferring to Duquesne for one season. At the conclusion of his junior year in 2007–08, James hired an agent after declaring himself eligible for the 2008 draft, thereby forgoing his final season of NCAA eligibility. He was never drafted.\nTwo schools on this list have two players represented. UConn's Emeka Okafor and Hasheem Thabeet each played three years for the Huskies before also declaring themselves for the NBA Draft. Northwestern State's D'or Fischer and William Mosley are both on this list, but Fischer only played for two seasons at Northwestern State before transferring to West Virginia."

        "text": "The McDonald's Championship was a women's professional golf tournament on the LPGA Tour from 1981 through 1993. The first six years were hosted by White Manor Country Club in Malvern, Pennsylvania, northwest of Philadelphia. In 1987, it moved a short distance south to DuPont Country Club in Wilmington, Delaware.\nThe tournament was founded by Herb Lotman, founder and CEO of Keystone Foods. His co-founder was Frank Quinn. The 28 year old tournament is still the largest fundraiser in the history of golf donating over $47 million to charity. Herb Lotman was quoted as saying, \"everything we did, we did for 'the kids'.\"\nIn its first year in 1981, the purse was $150,000 with a winner's share of $22,500, won by Sandra Post. The last edition in 1993 had a purse of $900,000; Laura Davies won by a stroke and took the $135,000 winner's share.\nBeginning in 1994, McDonald's sponsored the next sixteen editions of the LPGA Championship, one of the tour's four major championships, and the regular tour event was retired. Play continued at DuPont Country Club in Wilmington from 1994 through 2004, then moved in 2005 to Bulle Rock Golf Course in nearby Havre de Grace, Maryland. After the 2009 edition, McDonald's ended its 29-year relationship with the LPGA Tour."

        "text": "The Scarboro Golf and Country Club is a private club in eastern Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the former city of Scarborough. Until 2018, it had facilities for curling and has an 18-hole golf course that is ranked among the top courses in Canada.\nThe club was founded in 1912 by stockbroker A.E. Ames. Its site is located in the Woburn neighbourhood, approximately from downtown Toronto. The course was originally designed by George Cumming and was extensively changed in 1924 under the direction of one of the America's celebrated designers, A. W. Tillinghast (who designed noted U.S. Open courses - Baltusrol Golf Club, Bethpage Black and Winged Foot amongst others), his only work in Canada and in his only work outside of the United States. In 1947, legendary golf course designer Stanley Thompson was commissioned to reduce the severity of some of the slopes on the course including major work on a hill on the eighth hole. The course plays to par 71, and it plays to 6,547 yards from the championship tees through the West Highland Creek valley. The creek comes into play as many as 11 times in 18 holes, and the hilly terrain, gullies and trees as natural hazards, making artificial hazards almost unnecessary at Scarboro.\nThe club has been host of the Canadian Open golf tournament four times, as follows:\nNumerous other professional and amateur events have been conducted on the club's fairways, most recently hosting the 1987 and 2012 CPGA Tour Championship. Scarboro hosted the 1954 Labatt Open won by Bud Holscher who shot a course record score of 63 in the final round. In hosting the 1958 Canadian Amateur Championship, a first round casualty was an 18-year-old Jack Nicklaus. In 1961, the course was one of 25 that hosted the World Series of Golf matches between Masters and British Open champions, Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. In 2022, the club was host of the 100th Ontario Amateur Championship.\nThe course gives its name — with a change in spelling to Scarborough — to the north-south concession road astride which it lies, Scarborough Golf Club Road.\nThe widening and construction of a bridge under the adjacent GO Transit Lakeshore East line local rail corridor was cited as the reason for the closing of the curling facility in 2018, a decision taken by club's board of directors, and supported by a majority of club shareholders, though closing the curling facility was not absolutely necessary for the widening. The decision caused some controversy as some curling club members wanted the facility to remain."

The Budapest Blax were founded in March 2008, and were actively practising in April. In May, \"European Lacrosse Federation\" president Peter J. Mundy traveled to Budapest to hold a clinic. The team's size grew considerably over the summer months. By November, the team was able to host a friendly match against Bratislava, Slovakia's \"Bratislava Bats\". The Slovakian club was much more experienced and won the game easily.\nIn 2009, the club continued to expand. In March of that year, the Blax traveled to Bratislava for a tournament, where they faced off against the \"Bratislava Bats\" once again, as well as the \"Vienna Cherokees\". The Blax finished the tournament in third place.\nDespite having little experience, the Blax maintained a good relationship with the Austrian Lacrosse Federation and received permission to participate in the Austrian Lacrosse League in 2009. The team played throughout the summer, and had the opportunity to host a playoff game in September. The Blax finished their inaugural season in 6th place. This relatively successful first season resulted in the team being offered a permanent spot in the Australian Lacrosse League.\nIn January 2010, Budapest hosted the \"New Years Cup\", hosting teams from across Europe including the Graz Gladiators (Austria), the Vienna White Coats (Austria), and the Ljubljana Dragons (Slovenia).\nData.\nDate of foundation.\n\"16 March 2008\"\nReferences.\nWebsite of the Hungarian Lacrosse Federation,\nSportgéza (Hungarian),\nWebsite of the Nagy Sportágválasztó (Hungarian),\nNemzeti Sport Online (online version of the National Sports newspaper) (Hungarian),\nMiTörtént.hu (event collections website) (Hungarian),\nSzabadban (event collections website)."

Junior Eli Holman led the team in scoring with 15 points and also grabbed 13 rebounds. The game was described as sloppy, with both teams committing a combined 40 turnovers. Detroit shot 4 of 22 from beyond the arc and shot 31% from the field.\n11/16/2010 – Detroit at #11 Syracuse&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit played aggressive on defense and hit a few well-timed shots, putting the Titans up 28 to 25 at half-time. However, Syracuse went on a 17–4 run in the first six minutes of the second half to take a commanding lead at 42–32. Syracuse proceeded to turn the ball over three straight times, resulting in a 10–2 rally by Detroit that cut the lead to just two points with the score 44–42 with 9:29 to go in the game. Syracuse responded with a 13–2 run to make the game 53–42 at 8:20, and Detroit would not come close for the rest of the game.

The Bulldogs opened the game with an 18–12 lead just 4 minutes into the game, but the Titans fought back to take a 22–18 lead with 12:44 left in the half. Mississippi State went on the offensive, taking a commanding 40–32 lead at half-time. Detroit avoided foul trouble to help stay in the game, not allowing Mississippi State a single free throw attempt until the second half. Detroit opened up the final frame by making 9 of 14 shots from the field in the first 8 minutes, bringing the Titans within a single basket at 57–54. The Bulldogs pushed the lead back to 10 at 66–56 with 8:42 left in the game, but the Titans did not go away, hitting several layups and jump shots down the stretch to be down by just 3 once again at 76–73 with just over a minute to play.

As a result of their barrage, they led at half-time against the Titans 42–39. Detroit battled back to take the lead, but Albany hit a three pointer as time expired, tying the game at 68 at the end of regulation. The Titans led throughout most of the first overtime, but with the clock running down and Detroit up 72–69, Billy Allen of Albany again hit a three pointer as the buzzer sounded. In the second overtime, the Titans quickly built a six-point lead to bring the score to 78–72 and would not relinquish the lead for the rest of the game. A free throw by Ray McCallum put the Titans up 84–82 with 7 seconds to play. Albany's Ralph Watts attempted a last second three-pointer for the win but missed, giving the Detroit Titans their second victory of the season. Eli Holman led the charge for Detroit, scoring a career-high 27 points and grabbing a team-high 15 rebounds.\n11/27/2010 – Detroit vs Bowling Green&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit's second opponent in two nights was the Bowling Green Falcons of the Mid-American Conference. The Titans got out to an 8–0 start and went on to win 71–62. Eli Holman recorded his fourth double-double of the season, scoring 13 points and taking in 14 rebounds. Five Titans had 10 more points on the night, and they shot 55 percent from the field in the second half to keep the Falcons at bay.\n11/28/2010 – Detroit vs Niagara&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit's final challenge in the Legends Classic was to get past the Niagara Purple Eagles of the Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference. Niagara started the game with a dunk, but not long after that the Titans rattled off a 9–0 run. The Titans' Nick Minnerath answered Niagara's dunk with one of his own, sparking a large run to the end of the half where Detroit was up 52–33, shooting 53% from the field.\nThe Titans started the second half picking up where they left off, going on an 8–0 run to bring their lead to 27. Detroit took a then season-low six three-point field goal attempts, opting instead to pound it inside and take jumpers which led to an overall shooting percentage of 48% on the evening. This was a radical change from their offensive scheme against Syracuse earlier in the season, and it paid off with an easy 96–77 win over the Purple Eagles.\nFive Titans were in double figures in points on the night. Two of them recorded double-doubles for the Titans. LaMarcus Lowe had 12 points and 10 rebounds, while Eli Holman recorded his 6th double-double in 7 games, posting up 11 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Ray McCallum led the team in scoring with 21 points while Jason Calliste put up a strong performance of 17 points on just 3 field goals in 6 attempts, but also 9 for 10 from the free throw line. Minnerath and Holman were named to the Legends Classic All-Tournament Team, with Holman taking Most Valuable Player honors.\n12/1/2010 – Detroit vs Akron&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit entered its second game of five against the MAC, this time hosting the Akron Zips. Chase Simon had a season-high 24 points including 20 in the second half, Eli Holman came just short of another double-double with a 13 rebounds and 9 points, and Ray McCallum contributed with 8 points, 10 assists, and 6 rebounds, but it proved to not be enough. The Titans fought to keep pace with Akron all game long, being down by one 37–36 at half-time, but the Zips' play in the second half overwhelmed Detroit in the second with Akron's lead ballooning as high as 11, leading to the Titans' first home loss of the season 77–69. It was the first lost for the Titans against a MAC school in seven games, and Akron also broke Detroit's nine straight wins against non-conference opponents at home.\n12/4/2010 – Detroit vs Wright State&lt;br&gt;\nDetroit opened Horizon League play at home against the Wright State Raiders. The Titans scored 10 of the first 12 points in the game, and never trailed. In the first half, Eli Holman hit for 5–6 from the field with 12 points and 8 rebounds, leading Detroit to a 39–30 lead at the half. Wright State fought back in the second half to get the lead to as little as 67–64, but Detroit hit the majority of their free throws down the stretch and Holman capped it off with a dunk with 21 seconds remaining as he helped the Titans win 78–69. Jason Calliste led all scorers with 20 points on 4–of–5 shooting, all for threes, and 8–of–11 on free throws. Holman had 17 points and 12 rebounds, and Ray McCallum added 14 points, 6 rebounds, and 4 assists.\n12/8/2010 – Detroit at Western Michigan&lt;br&gt;\nThe Titans began a three-game road trip in the state of Michigan, starting off by facing the Western Michigan Broncos. Western Michigan led by as much as 11 in the opening frame, but Detroit successfully rallied in the last minute to cut the lead to 6 going into the break at 33–27 WMU. The Broncos scored the first 6 points of the second half, but Detroit scored 10 straight to bring the Titans within 2 at 39–37. Ray McCallum hit a three–pointer to tie the game up at 48–48. Western Michigan again got out to a big lead, up 9, but a series of points in the paint tied the game up once again at 66–66 with 2:11 remaining. The Broncos' Mike Douglas hit two free throws and a trey to put his team up five with less than a minute to go. Jason Calliste converted a three–point play to cut the Bronco lead to 2. With just four seconds left, McCallum had his shot blocked, and the Titans failed to get off another clear shot as they fell to Western Michigan 71–69. McCallum led the team in scoring with 19 points. Eli Holman had 14 rebounds and 6 points."

        "text": "Henry Hill (born October 31, 1948) is a former American football player, who played at the defensive guard position as a walk-on for the University of Michigan from 1968 to 1970. He was chosen as the co-captain and Most Valuable Player on the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team and a first-team All-American that same year.\nEarly years.\nA native of Detroit, Michigan, Hill is the youngest child in a family of five boys and two girls. He attended Detroit's Martin Luther King High School where he played football at the tight end position.\nUniversity of Michigan.\nWalk-on status.\nBecause of his size, Hill was not heavily recruited by major college teams. \nInterviewed in 1970, Hill recalled, \"I was a tight end in high school and I didn't get many scholarship offers because my size was marginal. You don't see too many 5-10 tight ends around.\" Hill enrolled at the University of Michigan on a Michigan Opportunity Grant, a scholarship offered to under-privileged students with strong academic backgrounds. Interviewed by a reporter from the UPI in 1969, Hill said, \"It's an academic scholarship. One of those kind they give to ghetto kids. My family was too poor to send me to school.\"\nHill tried out for the Michigan football team at the invitation of George Mans, Michigan's offensive ends coach. He recalled that, during his try-out, they threw a ball to him, and the ball bounced off his head, resulting in his being converted into a lineman. He played briefly for Michigan's freshman football team in 1967 but quit midway through the season to concentrate on his studies.\n1968 season.\nIn the spring of 1968, Hill tried out for Michigan's varsity football team. He made the cut and was listed as a fourth-string defensive lineman at the conclusion of spring practice. Damer recalled, \"I just stuck it out, figuring I'd get to play some.\"\nBy the time the 1968 football season began, Hill had been promoted to second-string status. The coaching staff was impressed by Hill's quickness, and he played in all 10 games for the 1968 team, including 7 games as the starting middle guard. His rise in 1968 from the fourth-string to starter was so rapid that his picture did not appear in the team's 1968 game program. The \"Toledo Blade\" in October 1968 ran a feature story on Hill and noted: \"At 5-10, 200 pounds, Henry isn't big enough to play Big 10 football. Try telling that to Henry. ... Hill is a walk-on (non-scholarship) who made it big for the Wolverines. He's small, but he is tough, and he loves to play football.\" Hill finished the 1968 season as one of Michigan's statistical leaders on defense with 72 tackles, including 50 solo tackles and 16 tackles for loss.\n1969 season.\nIn 1969, Hill started all 11 games for the Wolverines at the middle guard position on defense and also started three games as a guard on offense. He led the team with 90 tackles during the 1969 season.\nHill was routinely double-teamed in 1969 and 1970. Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler said of Hill, \"I don't think any team in the country can adequately contain Hill with one-on-one blocking.\" Hill expressed frustration at being double-teamed, but recognized its value to the team: \"Sometimes, I'm even getting triple-teamed on the pass rush. But that's got to help our defense so it's okay with me. If they do that, it leaves eight or nine men to play offense and we have ten men to play defense.\" Hill was named United Press International's Midwest Lineman of the Week after recording nine solo tackles and two assists against Minnesota in 1969. Following the game, Hill explained to reporters \"with a trace of incredulity\" in his voice, \"They didn't double team me.\"\nIn Michigan's rivalry game against Ohio State in 1969, he had 13 tackles, leading \"The Michigan Daily\" to note that Hill had demonstrated to his Ohio State counterpart, All-American Jim Stillwagon, \"just who is the best middle guard in the conference.\"\n1970 season.\nHill was selected as the defensive captain for the 1970 Michigan Wolverines football team, serving as co-captain with quarterback Don Moorhead. He started all 10 games as the Wolverines middle guard on defense and accumulated 69 tackles, including 12 tackles for loss. At the end of the 1970 season, Hill was selected by his teammate as the team's Most Valuable Player along with Don Moorhead. He was also selected by the Central Press Association in 1970 as a first-team All-American and by the Associated Press as a second-team All-American.\nReputation for quickness.\nHill developed a reputation as one of the quickest players at his position, as reflected in the following comments from football reporters:\nWhen Bo Schembechler took over as Michigan's coach in 1969, Hill acknowledged being \"a little overweight\" at 223 pounds. When Hill told the new coach he could run 40 yards in 4.6 seconds, Schembechler said, \"Aw come on, you're kidding me.\" To Schembechler's surprise, Hill proceeded to run the 40 in 4.6 seconds.\nHill was not selected in the 1971 NFL Draft, and the omission of the \"cat-quick\" middle guard was reported as one of the \"conspicuous absences from the draft lists.\" Hill noted that he didn't expect to get drafted, although he added he would like a chance to become pro."

        "text": "ICC U19 Cricket World Cup Europe Qualifier (formerly ICC Europe Under-19 Championships) are a series of regular cricket tournaments organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC) as the European qualifier for the Under-19 Cricket World Cup. The tournament was originally organised by the European Cricket Council (ECC). Traditionally there have always been two divisions though the nature of these divisions has varied strongly over the years.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the tournament was played in 1999 in Northern Ireland. The teams were split across two divisions, the more developed cricketing nations of Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands and Denmark joining England in the A Championship and three other associates, Gibraltar, Italy and Germany forming the B Championship. England won the tournament easily and would not participate again.\nFollowing this inaugural competition, the higher, eventually referred to as Division One, was played every year between Ireland, Scotland, Netherlands and Denmark. Every other year, the Division Two tournament was also played alongside. In 2003, France debuted in the second division, later joined by Belgium and Israel in 2005 and by Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man in 2007.\nIn 2003, a different approach was taken with all the teams across both divisions participating in a preliminary qualification round. However, this did not affect the make-up of the divisions whatsoever as the four more developed nations easily overpowered the others and cemented their position in Division One. After this the system was abandoned and the old format was reintroduced the following year.\nA fresh initiative for the 2006 edition was a new two-day format for Division One. The aim of this was to provide the players with some practice for the style of multi-day play encountered in the Intercontinental Cup. The one-day format returned the following year.\n2007 saw the two divisions being played separately for the first time when Division One was located in Ireland, but the nine-team Division Two was played in Jersey. This was Jersey's first ever European cricket competition.\nAnother change was made to the division format in 2009 when Jersey and Guernsey were relocated into Division One. This evened out the number of teams across the divisions and a win from Jersey over Denmark demonstrated their ability to play in the top flight. As a result, the two teams remained for the 2010 tournament where both teams performed even better than the previous year.\nPlans have been unveiled that in 2011, for the first time, there will be a chance of promotion from Division Two. The total number of participants will also be increased from thirteen to fifteen."

        "title": "Tehkan World Cup",
        "text": " originally released as in Japan, is an association football video game released to arcades in 1985 by Tehkan, the former name of Tecmo. It features multiplayer gameplay and trackball controllers. It was released in both upright and table arcade cabinets, but was most commonly released in a cocktail cabinet form factor. Its arrival coincided with the buildup to the 1986 FIFA World Cup. It featured the then colors of several of the world's top teams such as West Germany, Argentina and Brazil, although it did not mention any team by name.\nThe game uses a bird's-eye view, with the trackball controls allowing game physics such as controlling both the direction and speed of the shot. The gameplay format was adapted from the American football game \"Gridiron Fight\", developed by the same team and released earlier in the year, for an association football game, but with the controls simplified down to a trackball and single action button. It became a major success in arcades, and was a landmark title for association football games upon release. While \"Tehkan World Cup\" was not officially ported to home systems at the time, its gameplay format was later adapted by Sensible Software to develop the home computer game \"MicroProse Soccer\" (1988) and provided the basis for later association football games such as the \"Sensible Soccer\" series in the early 1990s.\nIn 1990, \"Tehkan World Cup\" was ported to the Nintendo Entertainment System as \"Tecmo World Cup Soccer\". The original arcade version was also released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles as Tecmo Cup in the 2000s.\nGameplay.\nGraphically, it offered a two-dimensional bird's-eye view of the field that was unique for its time. It has multi-directional scrolling, with only a portion of the field visible on screen at any time.\nIts trackball control system contributed significantly to its gameplay which was relatively speedy and exhibited a fluidity something akin to ice hockey, with as little as 3 seconds required to score from kick-off. Two-player action could be highly competitive, with players facing each other across the game space while using sweeping arm movements reminiscent of table tennis.\nThere was a single fire button along with the trackball. The game physics allowed the trackball to control both the direction and the velocity of the shot. There is also a mini-map, displaying the positions of all the players.\nDevelopment.\n\"Tehkan World Cup\" was developed by Tehkan, the former name of Tecmo. It was developed shortly after the American football game \"Gridiron Fight\", released earlier the same year, with several of the same team members working on \"Tehkan World Cup\". The game was planned and designed by Shin-ichiro Tomie with Kazutoshi Ueda (who previously worked on titles such as \"Space Panic\", \"Lady Bug\", \"Mr. Do!\" and \"Bomb Jack\"). It was programmed by Michishito Ishizuka, while character design and background graphics were handled by his wife Rie Ishizuka (also known as Rie Yatomi), cabinet design by Kohji Okada, and illustrations by Hideyuki Yokoyama.\nTomie, who had previously designed \"Gridiron Fight\", was a big soccer fan, so he wanted to adapt the gameplay format of \"Gridiron Fight\" for a soccer game. \"Gridiron Fight\" used similar trackball controls, but was more complex. The team decided to simplify the controls, so that the player can run with the trackball and press one button to kick.\nReception.\nThe game was a major arcade hit. In Japan, \"World Cup\" was listed by ' magazine as the seventh top-grossing arcade game of November 1985. ' magazine later listed \"World Cup\" on their February 15, 1986 issue as being the third most successful table arcade cabinet of the month. It went on to be Japan's fourth highest-grossing table arcade game for two years in a row, in 1986 and 1987.\nUpon release, David Snook of \"Play Meter\" magazine praised the game and said that \"most consider\" it \"the best soccer game around right now\" on the market. Mike Roberts of \"Computer Gamer\" magazine gave \"Tehkan World Cup\" a generally favorable review upon release, noting the \"very good graphics\" and trackball controls.\nLegacy.\nTecmo released an arcade successor to the game, \"Tecmo World Cup '90\", in 1989.\nShinichiro Tomie, who was a big soccer fan, went on to develop Tecmo's \"Captain Tsubasa\" series of association football games, based on the popular sports manga and anime series. The first title in the series, the Nintendo Famicom game \"Captain Tsubasa\" (1988), was released as \"Tecmo Cup Soccer Game\" in North America and \"Tecmo Cup Football Game\" in Europe. Tecmo later went on to develop \"Tecmo Cup Football Game\" (1993) with Sega for the Mega Drive console, before the game was cancelled.\nTomie, who later became the scenario writer for Chunsoft's \"Shiren the Wander\" series of \"Mystery Dungeon\" role-playing video games, returned to the association football game genre with the Game Boy Advance spin-off \"Shiren Monsters: Netsal\" (2004), a soccer game.\n\"Tehkan World Cup\" was released in 2004 for the PlayStation 2 and in 2005 for the Xbox, in both cases under the name \"Tecmo Cup\".\n\"Stuff\" ranked \"Tehkan World Cup\" the fourteenth best football game of all time.\nImpact.\n\"Tehkan World Cup\" was a landmark title for association football games upon release. It was considered \"revolutionary\" for its trackball control system, as well as its top-down perspective that allows players to see more of the pitch, and its physics where players control the direction and speed of the shot with the trackball. Its use of a top-down overhead perspective was predated by Alpha Denshi's \"Exciting Soccer\" (1983), but \"Tehkan World Cup\" was responsible for popularizing the format.\nGame designer Jon Hare cited \"Tehkan World Cup\" as the biggest influence on the football games developed by him and Chris Yates at Sensible Software. It was the basis and the inspiration for the home computer game \"MicroProse Soccer\" (1988). Hare referred to \"MicroProse Soccer\" as an \"arcade conversion\" of \"Tehkan World Cup\", but said it was not \"a carbon copy\" as they also added their \"own elements\" to the gameplay. Design elements from \"Tehkan World Cup\" and \"MicroProse Soccer\" in turn provided the basis for Sensible Software's successful \"Sensible Soccer\" series, created by Jon Hare and Chris Yates in 1992."

In 1957, the Industrial Little League of Monterrey, Mexico won the South Region championship before Latin America was given its own berth starting with the 1958 LLWS. In 1968, Delaware and Maryland moved to the East Region. In 2000, Oklahoma replaced Kentucky in the region for one year before the region split into two. The tournament was held in Saint Petersburg, Florida each year between 1972 and 2000.\nLittle League Baseball expanded the LLWS to sixteen teams for the 2001 Little League World Series.

The Arabian-American Little League in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia won each of the three MEA championships until 2011 when the Reverend John Foundation Little League from Kampala, Uganda won the tournament, however the team from Uganda was not able to participate after their visa applications to enter the United States were denied, and Dhahran was invited to participate in their place.\nIn 2012, a team from Lugazi, Uganda, won the tournament, to become the first African team to compete in the Little League World Series. Not all the players were able to make the trip, due to costs. Traditionally, the team practiced barefoot, but Little League World Series supporters provided the team with baseball cleats. Justine Makisimu had the first African base hit. As popular as this team became, they were not one of the top contenders in the Little League World Series. Uganda lost to Panama 9–3, and Mexico 12–0, eliminating them in two games. However, they beat Oregon, 3–2, in a consolation game.\nPrior to 2008, Middle Eastern and African teams competed in either the Europe/Middle East/Africa region (EMEA) or the Transatlantic region. The Transatlantic and EMEA regions were geographically identical. Leagues from the Transatlantic region generally consisted of children and other dependents of American expatriates, typically Armed Forces personnel, international organization members, and oil company workers (such as the team representing the Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran). The leagues within the EMEA region consisted of players native to the league's own country. In practice, however, only European teams competed in the EMEA region, as no teams from the Middle East or Africa ever competed for the regional championship.\nThe region was disbanded following the 2012 LLWS due to a major reorganization triggered by Little League's announcement that Australia would receive an automatic berth beginning with the 2013 LLWS.

        "title": "David Samson (baseball)",
        "text": "David P. Samson (born February 26, 1968) is a former American sports executive. Samson was the president of the Miami Marlins of Major League Baseball from 2002 until September 2017. He held the title of Executive Vice President with the Montreal Expos from 1999 to 2002, working in both cities under team owner and former stepfather Jeffrey Loria. He is the host of \"Nothing Personal with David Samson\" and co-host of \"The Sporting Class\" with former ESPN president John Skipper at Meadowlark Media. Samson was also a contestant on the reality TV program \"\" in 2014.\nAs president of the Marlins, Samson played a key role in negotiations to secure a public/private partnership to build a retractable roof ballpark, LoanDepot Park which opened on April 4, 2012. He was one of the driving forces behind the rebranding of the franchise following the 2011 season. The rebranding, which was revealed on November 11, 2011, included the changing of the club's name from the Florida Marlins to Miami Marlins and changes to the team's logo and uniforms.\nSeveral controversies have surrounded Samson's tenure in baseball, both in Montreal and Miami. Samson is known for his outspoken nature, especially in dealings with the media and major lawsuits have been filed in response to his business dealings on behalf of the Expos and Marlins.\nEarly life, education, and family.\nSamson was born to Allen and Sivia Samson in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on February 26, 1968. Samson is Jewish. He was the couple's second child, following older sister Nancy. Allen and Sivia divorced not long after Samson's birth, and his mother moved with her two children to New York City in 1976. Samson also has half siblings, sisters Rachel and Samantha and a brother, Daniel, from his parents’ subsequent marriages.\nUpon moving to New York City, Samson was enrolled at the Horace Mann School in the Bronx, where he completed grades 1–12. Following high school, he attended Tufts University in Somerville, Massachusetts for one year before transferring to the University of Wisconsin for his sophomore year. He graduated from Wisconsin in 1990 with a B.A. in Economics and a minor in Philosophy. Samson attended the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University beginning in 1990, receiving his Juris Doctor in 1993.\nSamson and his wife, Cindi, were married in 1990 and have three children: Hannah, Kyra, and Caleb.\nFollowing his graduation from law school, Samson founded News Travels Fast in 1993, the first company to deliver \"The New York Times\", and later \"Barron's\" and \"The Wall Street Journal\", to Europe on a same-day basis. The rise of internet sites that provided news delivery would eventually bring an end to the endeavor in 1996.\nIn early 1997, Samson joined Morgan Stanley as an investment advisor, a position he held until joining the Montreal Expos’ front office in December 1999.\nCareer.\nMontreal Expos (1999–2002).\nSamson was named executive vice president of the Montreal Expos in December 1999, shortly after his then-stepfather, Jeffrey Loria, purchased the ownership stake of Claude Brochu and became chairman, CEO and managing general partner on December 9.\nThe tenure of Loria and Samson in Montreal would be brief, however. Samson played a key role in negotiating the sale of the Expos and the subsequent purchase of the Florida Marlins in 2002. In a complex franchise swap that reshaped the landscape of baseball in three American and National League East Division cities, Loria sold the Expos to a Delaware partnership, Expos Baseball, LP. The partnership had been formed by a vote of the Major League Baseball owners so that Loria would be free to purchase the Marlins from John W. Henry, who needed to sell the South Florida Club in order to complete his purchase of the Boston Red Sox. The Expos would later be moved to Washington, D.C., by Major League Baseball.\nRICO lawsuit following the sale of the Expos.\nIn July 2002, Samson was one of several defendants named in a federal complaint filed in Miami under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). The complaint was filed by 14 former minority partners of the Expos against Loria, MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, MLB Chief Operating Officer Bob DuPuy, the commissioner's office, and Samson.\nThe suit alleged that Selig, Loria, and Samson conspired for more than two years to eliminate the Montreal franchise and move it to the United States, and that Selig had conducted mail fraud and wire fraud in the process. The complaint further accused Loria and Samson of conspiring with baseball officials to dilute the minority partners’ share of the team from 76 percent to 6-to-7 percent and of never intending to keep the franchise in Montreal. In response to the allegations, Loria and Samson argued that the partners’ share was decreased because the partners refused to put up additional money that was requested by Loria in cash calls that were permitted by the partnership agreement. Loria also accused the former minority partners of hypocrisy, claiming they had been unwilling to fund any operating losses since 1991 and had directed fire sales of players during the 1990s.\nThe case against Loria, Samson and MLB essentially ended on November 15, 2004, when a three-judge arbitration panel in New York ruled unanimously that there was no fraud or breach of fiduciary duties committed by Loria and Samson. As a result of the binding ruling, the limited partners dropped their bid for an injunction against the relocation of the Expos and eventually declined to pursue the federal RICO suit.\nPurchase of the Marlins and a World Series championship.\nAfter Samson led negotiations for Loria's $158.5 million purchase of the Marlins on February 16, 2002, which was approved by MLB owners on February 12, the Club moved nearly 50 employees from the Expos organization to the Marlins.\nAfter a 79–83 season in 2002 in which the Club finished fourth in the NL East, the Marlins made several key additions to the squad in 2003, highlighted by the signing of Ivan \"Pudge\" Rodriguez and the re-acquisition of Jeff Conine, and surprised the baseball world by winning the second World Series in Club history.\nDuring the regular season, the team improved its record by 12 games, finishing at 91–71 to earn the National League Wild Card berth. The team was fueled in 2003 by Jack McKeon, who became manager on May 11 and led the team to a 75-49 record for the rest of the regular season, the second-best mark in the Majors over that span. In addition, outfielder Juan Pierre, catcher Iván Rodríguez and reliever Ugueth Urbina, and rookie call-ups Miguel Cabrera, an outfielder at the time, and Dontrelle Willis, a starting pitcher, all helped the Marlins in their record run.\nThe 2003 postseason run began with a thrilling win over the Giants in the divisional round. The series ended in game four on collision at home plate between San Francisco's J. T. Snow and Rodriguez, who made the tag and held onto the ball for the final out of a 7–6 win. The Marlins went on to overcome a 3–1 deficit in the National League Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs, coming back from a 3–0 deficit in game six and a 5–3 deficit in game seven, both on the road, to reach the World Series.\nFlorida then stunned the New York Yankees in the World Series in six games, clinching the championship at Yankee Stadium on a complete-game shutout by starting pitcher Josh Beckett.\nThe Marlins won the World Series, becoming just the 3rd wild card team to do so. They joined the 1997 Marlins and 2002 Angels in accomplishing this feat. They have since been joined by the 2004 Red Sox, 2011 Cardinals, 2014 Giants, and the 2019 Nationals. However, just like after their 1997 championship, the team fell apart in the following seasons and did not reach the playoffs again until 2020.\nNew Marlins Ballpark.\nThe biggest challenge facing the long-term stability of the Marlins in 2002 was the club's inability to secure a baseball-only ballpark, with shelter from the extreme summer temperatures and precipitation patterns of the South Florida region. The first two owners of the Franchise, Wayne Huizenga and John W. Henry, respectively, had failed in their efforts to secure funding for such a facility.\nSamson led a negotiating team that worked for more than six years to finalize a public/private partnership to build a new retractable roof, air-conditioned ballpark in Miami. Prior to final approval in March 2009, there had been many failed attempts to complete a deal. A new ballpark, originally slated to open in 2005, never came to fruition, due to lack of State funding. Several unsuccessful attempts to secure State funding from Tallahassee delayed the deal even further, as well as changes in potential sites. When the university of Miami Hurricanes left the old Orange Bowl to play its games elsewhere, the original Orange Bowl was demolished by the City of Miami, thereby creating a perfect site for the new ballpark. In March 2009, final approval of the public/private partnership was completed between the Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami and the Marlins. Absent from the final deal was any participation by the State of Florida. As part of the deal, Jeffrey Loria agreed to pay approximately $161.2M of the estimated $515M price tag.\nThe new stadium funding was included in a $3 billion redevelopment plan by Miami-Dade County that also partly funded a tunnel into the Port of Miami, provided a major infusion of money for the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts and funded urban redevelopment plans in Overtown and the Arts &amp; Entertainment District.\nSubsequent ballpark-related lawsuit.\nSouth Florida businessman Norman Braman filed a lawsuit in January 2008 alleging that the deal between the Marlins and the county to fund the new stadium was an illegal use of taxpayer money that was intended to combat urban blight, and should have been subject to a public vote. All seven counts of the lawsuit were eventually dismissed, the last on November 21, 2008, by Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Jeri Beth Cohen.\nDue to the nearly year-long delay caused by the Braman lawsuit, the original timeline for the construction of the stadium was delayed and the opening date was pushed back from the 2011 season to the 2012 season. The official groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 18, 2009, in front of 5,000 fans. The ballpark, and the newly rechristened Miami Marlins, hosted their first regular season game on April 4, 2012, against the St. Louis Cardinals."

The CCLA incorporates teams in Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. On August 8, 2018, the conference commissioners of the Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association and the Pioneer Collegiate Lacrosse League announced they would merge the conferences to form the Continental Lacrosse Conference.\nHistory.\nThe Central Collegiate Lacrosse Association was founded in 1972 as the Big Ten Lacrosse League. In 1999 the Big Ten Lacrosse League began accepting members outside of Big Ten schools. The CCLA is one of the original MCLA conferences and at one point included schools across the Midwestern United States. In 2002, schools from the southwestern portion of the conference left to form the Great Rivers Lacrosse Conference. The current CCLA includes 10 teams split into two Divisions with the top programs and larger schools in Division I and smaller schools and programs in Division II.\nMichigan won three straight MCLA DI Champions in 2008, 2009, and 2010 while the program was a member of the CCLA. In 2011 the university announced a move to the NCAA Division I level, ending the Wolverines long run of consecutive CCLA conference championships at 11. \nAt the Division II level the CCLA has been represented in the MCLA DII Championship in 2008 when Grand Valley State lost 17–10 to Westminster College and in 2009 Dayton lost to the University of St. Thomas 11-16. In the 2011 MCLA Division II Championship Davenport defeated St. Thomas 14-9.\nDivision I.\nSeven institutions make up the CCLA Division I. All of the CCLA DI members are members of NCAA Division I except Davenport University. Currently the CCLA DI league includes two teams from the Mid-American Conference, two teams from Big Ten Conference, one team from the Atlantic Coast Conference, one team from the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, and one team from the Horizon League.\nDivision II.\nThere are three members of the CCLA Division II conference.

        "text": "Canada Rugby League (CRL) () is the governing body for the sport of rugby league football in Canada. Founded in 2010, the CRL organizes the Canada national rugby league team and supports the development of the game through the country's domestic competitions.\nHistory.\nCanada Rugby League was formed in February 2010, by Eric Perez, \"with a vision to bring rugby league to the people of Canada\". The organisation was founded to redevelop organised rugby league in Canada, which had been dormant since the Canadian Rugby League Federation folded in 2000. The CRL reestablished the Canada national rugby league team to participate in international competition and set up a domestic league from which national team players would be drawn. The team played its first competitive game in ten years at the 2010 \"War at the Shore\" tournament, hosted by the American National Rugby League (AMNRL) in New Jersey. In September 2010 CRL hosted its first international game in Canada, with Canada facing the United States in the Colonial Cup. Later that year they competed in the Rugby League Atlantic Cup in Jacksonville, Florida. Canada won its first international match since 2000 on 31 July 2011 defeating Jamaica 40-10 in Markham, Ontario.\nIn 2017, Toronto Wolfpack to begin play in the third tier of the British rugby league system. They achieved promotion to the second tier in their first attempt. In May 2019, it was announced Canada would get a second team, Ottawa Aces to begin play in the third tier from 2021. On 22 October 2021, it was announced that Ottawa Aces would relocate back to the United Kingdom permanently due the \"unstable operating environment\" of running a club in the British leagues from Canada during a pandemic.\nLogo.\nThe Canada Rugby League logo, used since 2010, incorporates symbols and imagery of Canada and rugby league football. The CRL designed the logo to be \"unique compared to other Canadian sports logos, yet instantly recognisable to the League community\". The CRL gives this description of the logo: \"Blended with the core rugby league imagery of the ball and twin vee, the CRL logo has been designed to incorporate some very Canadian imagery including an outline of the entire country, and naturally the maple leaf. The colours of red, black and white are also synonymous with the country, and will be prominent on the Canadian national team.\" In 2015, after a whole new board was put in place, the logo was updated for the 2017 World Cup Qualifiers against Jamaica and the USA, with new sponsors IMPACT Prowear providing the kit. IMPACT Prowear then designed an entire off field range, which was released in collaboration with the CRL for these qualifiers.\nAn entirely new logo was introduced in February 2021 still based on the maple leaf but incorporating the chevrons from the national kit and giving the name in both French and English.\nDomestic competitions.\nThe CRL has also been developing a Canada-based domestic league. In July 2010, St. Catharines Bobcats, based in St. Catharines in Ontario's Niagara Region, were announced as the league's first domestic team. In September 2010 the Bobcats were joined by a second team, the Toronto City Saints. The Saints formed a relationship with the St Helens R.F.C. of the Super League. The Bobcats and Saints played two games against each other, with players for the national squad being drawn from the two teams. Toronto won both games.\nIn 2011, the CRL announced the domestic competition would expand to four teams in Ontario. St. Catharines Bobcats changed their name to the Niagara Bobcats, while two new clubs from the Toronto area were announced. The two new clubs are the York Region Reds, based in Ontario's York Region, and the Scarborough Centurions, based in Toronto's Scarborough area. York Region has a team partnership with Salford of the Super League, while Scarborough has a partnership with Leigh, who play in the Co-operative Championship.\nIn 2012, British Columbia commenced a new domestic competition which had 5 teams under the British Columbia Rugby League Competition (BCRL) banner. By the end of 2012, BC had become the premier competition within Canada. In 2013, BCRL expanded to 6 teams namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons."

        "title": "2011 Giro d'Italia",
        "text": "The 2011 Giro d'Italia was the 94th Giro d'Italia, one of cycling's Grand Tours. The race started on 7 May with a team time trial in Turin to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Italian unification, when the city served as the first capital of the single state.\nThe route was one of the most difficult in the modern history of the race, with substantial criticism that it was simply too hard for a three-week-long race. Of the seven stages categorized as 'high mountain', six had summit arrivals, highlighted by the three stages before the second rest day ending at Grossglockner in Austria, the exceptionally steep Monte Zoncolan, and a tall and steep peak near the Fascia Valley in Gardeccia. There was also, for the fifth consecutive Giro, a climbing time trial, this one to the Nevegal. Of the race's 18 mass-start stages, only three ended with the majority of the field together at the front of the race.\nIn the third stage, rider Wouter Weylandt crashed coming down the Passo del Bocco, near the town of Mezzanego, suffering catastrophic injury. Despite substantial resuscitation efforts, he was established to have died on the spot. The fourth stage was not competitively raced; instead, it was run as a cycling procession. On the second rest day, Xavier Tondó, a member of , was killed in an accident at his home. Although he was not a participant, his death caused his teammates and other members of the peloton to pay tribute to him in the subsequent stages.\nStrong overall favorite Alberto Contador was the race's original winner, in what constituted his second Giro championship. His winning margin ahead of second-placed Michele Scarponi was over six minutes. He also won the points competition as the most consistent high finisher, also with a substantial lead over Scarponi in second place, and Vincenzo Nibali completed the podium. In the other sub-classifications, Stefano Garzelli won the mountains competition and Roman Kreuziger finished as the best rider aged 25 or under in the general classification; he finished the race fifth overall.\nIn February 2012, the Court of Arbitration for Sport decided that Contador, following his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, lost his results since that event. He was therefore stripped of the 2011 Giro title, and Scarponi became the new victor of the race, and the winner of the points classification.\nTeams.\nAll 18 UCI ProTeams were invited automatically and obligated to attend. Two UCI Professional Continental teams were announced well ahead of time, and . UCI rules normally limit races to a peloton of 200 riders, but the Giro received special dispensation for a 207-rider peloton, allowing a 23rd team. The three additional invited teams were , , and . Despite talk that ProTeam might be excluded due to the doping scandals involving team members Riccardo Riccò and Ezequiel Mosquera, they were included pursuant to UCI rules.\nThe full list of participating teams is:\nPre-race favorites.\nWhile the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, including six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three editions of the Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and able to return to racing, though the case still pended a final appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.\nThe other five former Grand Tour winners in the field were Stefano Garzelli, Danilo Di Luca, Denis Menchov, Carlos Sastre, and Vincenzo Nibali. Of the five, only Menchov and Nibali were considered realistic overall contenders. Other riders named as contenders included Roman Kreuziger, riding as the leader of the team and a protected rider in a Grand Tour for the first time in his career, 2010 Giro d'Italia runner-up David Arroyo, captain and 2010 Giro fourth-place finisher Michele Scarponi, and Joaquim Rodríguez. Riders further noted as darkhorses included Sastre, Contador's teammate and main support rider Richie Porte, Di Luca, 's Igor Antón, Garzelli, Domenico Pozzovivo, Italian national champion Giovanni Visconti, and 's dual leaders Tiago Machado and Yaroslav Popovych. Visconti was given the irregular race number of 150, wearing it as the Italian national champion to commemorate 150 years of Italian unification. While squads are normally given numbers from the same group of ten, such as 151 through 159, numbers ending in zero are seldom issued. Visconti's squad wore numbers 150 through 158.\nThe ongoing Mantova doping investigation, involving members of the team, as it was known in 2009, had an effect on the race. It greatly affected the team itself, as their manager Giuseppe Saronni was implicated in the investigation and stepped down as team manager shortly before the Giro began. He was replaced by former sporting director Roberto Damiani. Their contingent for the Giro specifically excluded any riders or staff implicated in the investigation. The foremost of these riders was former Giro winner Damiano Cunego, though Damiani felt he would eventually be cleared of any wrongdoing. While the was unlikely to field an overall favorite, given that their top man Cadel Evans chose to focus on the Tour de France, they were also affected by the investigation, for the second year in a row. Just as they had before the 2010 Giro, the team suspended Alessandro Ballan and Mauro Santambrogio, members of the team in 2009 who were named in the investigation. As with 2010, the team reactivated the two riders after the Giro ended.\nThe near total dearth of flat, sprinter-friendly stages did not stop sprinters Mark Cavendish, Tyler Farrar, and Alessandro Petacchi, from all taking the start. One sprinter who was expected to take part in the race, 's Andrea Guardini, was not part of the start list. Though his sporting director at the Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey had promised him a place in the Giro should he win two stages at that event (Guardini did indeed win two stages in Turkey), the team believed he would be better served continuing to take part in somewhat smaller races. Other sprinters in the Giro peloton mainly came from much smaller teams and teams with little overall ambition. and sent two sprinters apiece—Gerald Ciolek and Francesco Chicchi for the Belgian team and Robbie Hunter and Robbie McEwen on the American squad. Giro debutants had among their squad Slovenian sprinter Borut Božič. 's sprinter was Francisco Ventoso, one of the season's most prolific winners to date. The small and also sent sprinters, Roberto Ferrari and 2010 Giro stage winner Manuel Belletti, respectively. The team had intended to send Daniele Bennati, a former winner of the points classification in the Giro d'Italia who had had great success at the recently run Circuit de la Sarthe. After a crash at the Tour de Romandie where he sustained multiple fractures and a lung contusion, he was forced out of the Giro. That squad therefore turned their sprinting hopes to the rider originally set to be Bennati's leadout man, Belgian sprinter Wouter Weylandt.\nRoute and stages.\nThe route for the 2011 Giro was unveiled in Turin on 23 October 2010. It was immediately recognized as being quite difficult, featuring 40 categorized climbs among its 18 mass-start stages, seven of them summit finishes. Seventeen of the 20 regions of Italy were visited in the race, as the 2011 race commemorated the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy. Attention was immediately drawn to the three stages preceding the second rest day, stages 13, 14, and 15, each of which featured summit finishes and multiple high-rated climbs, among them the Grossglockner, Monte Zoncolan, and the Passo Giau, this Giro's \"Cima Coppi\", its tallest climb. The route as it was originally announced was in length, just shy of the maximum length allowed under UCI regulations. The first summit finish was the Montevergine di Mercogliano in Stage 7, whilst the first week was concluded on the slopes of Mount Etna, which the peloton was faced with twice in stage 9. The final major climb was the Colle delle Finestre, which made its return after last featuring in the 2005 Giro d'Italia. While there were five stages classified as flat, and Italian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi claimed he saw as many as seven potential sprint finishes, consensus was overwhelming that the majority of the route favored the strongest of the climbers at the expense of other riders.\nWhile the route did get some positive critiques, there was also critical opinion that it was simply too difficult. This was particularly in comparison with the similarly difficult, yet not \"as\" difficult, route for the 2011 Tour de France revealed days earlier. sporting director Sean Yates called the route \"brutal\" and said that serious Tour de France contenders would not bother coming to the race since it was so difficult. This was seen as an early indication that his team's leader Bradley Wiggins would skip the Giro. Additional critical analysis concurred that the route was excessively difficult, for its incredible amount of vertical climbing ( in the route as originally announced), number of summit finishes and long transfers, and the unpaved or 'white roads' which featured in stages 5 and 20. Race director Angelo Zomegnan balked at the criticisms, saying simply \"It's a hard Giro but the Giro has to be hard.\"\nTwo stages in the second half of the Giro had their courses altered shortly before they were run. The more notable was stage 14, which had been hyped as the début of the Monte Crostis in the Giro d'Italia. Commissaires from the UCI mandated it be removed the night before stage 14 was run. The Crostis is not a well-maintained pass, and Giro officials had set out a detailed protocol whereby team cars would not follow the race up or down the mountain, and only motorbikes offering wheel changes would be present with the riders. Team managers expressed concern that they would not fully be able to fulfill their duties if not present with the riders like normal, and this was given as the basis of the UCI's decision. They held that Giro organizers had sufficiently ensured rider safety on the course, but the necessary protocols did not protect the sporting aspect of the race. Thus, the Crostis was eliminated, and the stage was reduced in length from its originally planned length of . The second-category Tualis climb was added to the route for the day to offset the loss of the Crostis. However, protests from spectators disappointed by the removal of the Crostis part of the route, including many who had volunteered for works to make parts of that road safe, led to the cancellation of the Tualis climb. The route was diverted while the stage was in progress to avoid a small village at the foot of the Tualis where protesters had gathered. Therefore, the length of the stage was shortened to . The Giro's last stage, an individual time trial in Milan, was also shortened. The course was shortened by four days before the stage took place, due to a special election taking place in Milan the same day as the stage. City officials expected high voter turnout and did not want the city center tied up by the race all day, so the revised route began at the outskirts of Milan instead of its center. It still ended, per its original design, at the Duomo di Milano.\nIn spite of first-hand criticism from riders following the race that the route was excessively difficult and dangerous, Zomegnan remained staunch in his defense of the route.\nRace overview.\nThe Giro began with a team time trial in the city that served as Italy's first federal capital, Turin. The squad won this stage, making their rider Marco Pinotti the first wearer of the race leader's pink jersey. That team's focus the next day was not to defend Pinotti's race lead, but to try to deliver their star sprinter Mark Cavendish to the victory, which would have the indirect effect of him overtaking Pinotti for the pink jersey. Cavendish indeed became the new race leader, but after an awkward final sprint it was not he but Italian Alessandro Petacchi who won the day. David Millar then became the third race leader in as many days when he finished with a breakaway group that was 21 seconds the better of the main field in stage 3, though this result was overshadowed by the death of Wouter Weylandt earlier in the stage.\nThe peloton chose not to run stage four competitively following Weylandt's death; instead the stage was ridden as a procession in his memory. The remaining members of his team , as well as training partner Tyler Farrar from the squad, crossed the finish line first with their arms around one another before withdrawing from the race that evening. Stage 5 was held on the dirt roads of Tuscany, which had provided for one of the more spectacular stages in the 2010 Giro d'Italia. Dutch rider Pieter Weening won the stage with an 8-second time gap against the field. That, coupled with the 20-second time bonus for winning the day, gave him the pink jersey. There was some stability in the overall standings at this point, as the race's top riders finished together, or nearly so, in the next three stages.\nStage 9 was the first major mountain stage, featuring two ascents of Mount Etna, including a summit finish. It was on this day that strong overall favorite Alberto Contador first seized control of the race. Just after 's José Rujano attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification. In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead for too many days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey. The Spaniard himself hinted that such a move would be in his plans. This would be likeliest to happen in the heavily undulating stage 11. The breakaway group for this stage was hard-fought and late-forming, since someone from its number could potentially become the new race leader. While 's Christophe Le Mével, who entered the day third overall and had on two other occasions come within a time bonus of claiming the jersey, made the group, neither he nor anyone in it was destined to take pink. Largely under the impetus of Michele Scarponi's team, the breakaway group was caught before the finish. Contador and the rest of the overall favorites finished at the front of the race, with riders well down in the standings claiming the time bonuses, meaning Contador retained the race leadership after all.\nContador took the most time against the main field out of any day in stage 13. On this day, which ended at the Grossglockner in Austria, he and Rujano again finished well ahead of the main field. As they approached the finish line, Contador did not attempt to sprint for the win, allowing Rujano to take it. Their minute and a half time gap, plus the time bonus for second place, gave Contador a lead of over three minutes in the overall standings. Only in the 2009 Tour de France had he ever held a larger lead. The next two days were extremely difficult high mountain stages, both won by members of the team. Contador finished the best of any rider in the top five overall on both days, and so further padded his advantage. Wearing a black armband to memorialize fellow Spanish cyclist Xavier Tondó who, though not a participant in the race, died while it was run, Contador dominantly won the stage 16 uphill individual time trial. This result put him nearly five minutes clear of the next-best rider, the largest such advantage he had ever held in any race. In stage 19, Contador again finished with another rider ahead of the main field. This time it was 's Paolo Tiralongo, a former teammate of Contador's. Just as he had with Rujano earlier, Contador appeared to allow his companion a stage win he could have easily taken himself. Contador later commented that the victory, the first of Tiralongo's 12-year career, was meant as a gesture of thanks to the Italian for all the support riding he did for him in 2010 when the two were on the same squad. Although Contador claimed that he was not going to give his strongest effort in the stage 21 individual time trial, the Giro's final stage, his ride was still good enough for third place, extending his winning margin to over six minutes, giving him his sixth and statistically most dominant Grand Tour championship. Contador's two stage wins and numerous top five placings also made him the winner of the points competition, by a substantial margin. Michele Scarponi and Vincenzo Nibali completed the podium, in that order, having targeted one another once it became obvious that Contador's advantage was insurmountable. Nibali held second place on stages 13 and 14, but Scarponi overtook him on Gardeccia, finishing a minute and a half better (only six seconds the lesser of Contador), and never relinquished second place. Stefano Garzelli was in the breakaway on the Gardeccia stage and took maximum points on three of the day's five climbs, and second place points on the other two. It was largely thanks to this performance that he won the mountains classification at the end of the race. Roman Kreuziger, still eligible by a matter of months, won the youth competition with his ride to sixth place overall.\nOn the whole, success proved to be fairly widespread. As did Contador, Cavendish won two stages, stages 10 and 12, but prior to Cavendish's second victory no team, let alone individual rider, had won two individual stages. Four other teams – , , , and  – eventually repeated as stage winners. won the ill-fated stage 3 with Ángel Vicioso and later stage 13 with Rujano. 's wins came on the two most difficult stages in the race, the back-to-back high mountain stages that preceded the second rest day. Their leader Igor Antón won the controversy-laden day ending at Monte Zoncolan, when the Monte Crostis climb was removed from the route. The next day, Mikel Nieve won the stage that Contador described as the hardest of his life, a seven-and-a-half-hour day with five high climbs ending at Gardeccia. Following Petacchi's win in the contentious sprint that finished the first road stage, the team took another stage win with young Diego Ulissi in stage 17, after another contentious sprint in which Italian national champion Giovanni Visconti actually crossed the line first but was relegated to third for shoving Ulissi. The had winners in stage 6 with Francisco Ventoso on an uphill sprint and in the Giro's last road race stage with Vasil Kiryienka in a solo breakaway that finished almost five minutes better than the rest of the field. , , , , , , and each won a single stage. With 's Garzelli claiming the mountains classification and Yaroslav Popovych from the \"Trofeo Fuga Pinarello\", 15 of the 22 teams that completed the race came away with some sort of victory.\nMuch like had occurred at the final podium celebrations for the 2009 Tour de France, the wrong national anthem was played for Contador. Race organizers mistakenly played an old Spanish anthem with lyrics favored by former Spanish dictator Francisco Franco. The Spanish national anthem as it should have been played would have been purely instrumental.\nDeath of Wouter Weylandt.\nDuring the descent of the Passo del Bocco in stage 3, rider Wouter Weylandt crashed and suffered catastrophic injury. Race doctor Giovanni Tredici, and the doctor for the team were in cars very near Weylandt's group on the road, and administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation for approximately 40 minutes. Doctors also gave Weylandt adrenaline and atropine to try to restart his heart, though Tredici stated that resuscitation efforts were rather clearly in vain, and that Weylandt was already dead by the time they got to him. Doctors were never able to revive Weylandt, and he was declared dead on the spot. A short time later, Weylandt's body was airlifted off the descent and taken to a nearby hospital, where the pathologist conducting the autopsy concluded that the Belgian had died immediately upon crashing. Weylandt's death was the first at the Giro in 25 years, and the first at one of cycling's Grand Tours since Fabio Casartelli died during the 1995 Tour de France.\nManuel Antonio Cardoso of had been nearest to Weylandt when he crashed, and stated that Weylandt had touched a small retaining wall on the left side of the road with either his pedal or his handlebars, and was then catapulted across the road to the other side, where he again collided with something. He had looked behind him to ascertain his exact position in the race when he clipped the wall. Teammate Tom Stamsnijder also witnessed the accident, saying \"it was a very hard fall.\" Italian police, conducting an inquest into Weylandt's death, also took an official statement from the Portuguese rider at Team RadioShack's hotel. A memorial was placed at the crash site, where Weylandt's pregnant girlfriend and his mother, along with cyclists, passersby and residents of nearby villages, placed flowers. The team remained in the race for another day at the encouragement of Weylandt's family. David Millar, who had taken the race lead that same day, spent the evening discussing with members of , Weylandt's best friend Tyler Farrar, and his girlfriend and mother how best to pay tribute to the fallen rider.\nRace director Angelo Zomegnan said in a post-stage press conference that race officials would respect whatever decision the peloton made regarding the next day's stage. As usually occurs when a rider dies in the midst of a multi-day cycling event, the next day was not competitively raced. Instead, the stage was preceded by a minute's silence, and ridden as a procession in Weylandt's memory. Each of the 23 teams took to the front of the peloton for about 15 minutes, and members of , along with Farrar, were allowed to finish first with their arms around each other. Millar led the rest of the field across the line a few seconds later. No results for the stage were recorded, and it did not count towards the general classification or any of the points competitions. After the stage, instead of any podium presentations, the four jersey classification leaders (Millar, Alessandro Petacchi, Gianluca Brambilla, and Jan Bakelants) appeared on stage with the team to lead another moment of silence. Subsequently, Farrar and the remaining squad all decided to leave the race. Farrar later revealed that his inclusion with the Leopard Trek squad in the final moments of the neutralized stage was a decision made solely on their part, one for which he felt extremely grateful.\nA moment of silence was also held for Weylandt before stage 11, as his funeral took place the same day. Pieter Weening also gave the first pink jersey to be presented to him on the podium to Weylandt's surviving family, and stage 11 winner John Gadret stated that he had Weylandt in his thoughts as he crossed the line and dedicated his win to him, even though the two were not well acquainted.\nDeath of Xavier Tondó.\nOn 23 May, during the second rest day of the Giro, Xavier Tondó, the reigning Vuelta a Castilla y León champion and one of the leaders on the season for the , was killed in a freak accident at home while preparing to train with teammates. He was reportedly crushed between his car and a garage door.\nAlthough he was not taking part in this edition of the Giro, Tondó had participated in the 2010 edition and was a popular, well-liked rider. Race leader Alberto Contador, along with many others, rode the stage 16 individual time trial with black armbands. The stage was preceded by a minute of silence. Tondó's teammate Branislau Samoilau posted a time that was provisionally best much of the day and was visibly overcome with emotion when interviewed by assembled media after his ride. Contador, who recorded the best time in the time trial, dedicated the victory to Tondó, as the two were acquainted despite never having been teammates.\nFive days later, teammate and close friend Vasil Kiryienka rode to victory in a solo effort, and he too dedicated the stage victory to Tondó, pointing skyward as he crossed the finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tondó's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tondó's death) to honor him, while other members of the team grieved with Tondó's family. In the final days of the race, many fans wrote signs memorializing Tondó as they had with Weylandt earlier on.\nAftermath.\nImmediately after Weylandt's death, Giro officials announced that they would not issue his dossard number 108 in future editions of the race. His number was a prominent part of signs held by fans on the roadside at not just the Giro but other events later in the season as well, including the Tour of California where his death was part of the reason the first stage of that race was canceled due to safety concerns. Many other races, mostly those held in Weylandt's native Belgium, also began the practice of not issuing the number. The Belgian federation criticized this gesture, saying it would not bring Weylandt back and would only serve to continually remind fans and those in the sport of Weylandt's death. They issued the number for the Belgian national road race championships.\nAbout a month after the race concluded, reports began surfacing which stated that Giro director Angelo Zomegnan was going to be ousted from that position. Though praised for his delicate handling of Weylandt's death, Zomegnan's handling of the teams' protest of and eventual removal of the Monte Crostis from the Giro race route was seen much less approvingly. A further month later, RCS Sport, owners of the race, confirmed that Zomegnan had been removed from his largely autocratic position as race director. He was replaced by RCS general director Michele Acquarone and Mauro Vegni, along with a team of former professional riders. Zomegnan remains as an RCS consultant and director of the 2013 UCI Road World Championships in Florence. Zomegnan had held the position since 2004, beginning with the 2005 Giro d'Italia.\nAlong with the new organizational team came a certain measure of fan involvement in the direction of the 2012 Giro d'Italia. Fans of the race were able to vote on its official Facebook page for two climbs, from an initial pool of 64, to appear in the race. After several rounds of voting, the Stelvio Pass and the Passo del Mortirolo were chosen. They were later announced to be part of the same stage for the 2012 Giro. Fans were also given the opportunity to choose from among three prototypes for the design of the pink jersey in the 2012 Giro. Fans could also participate in a promotion called \"Tweet Your Maglia Rosa\" where they would submit 140-character or fewer Twitter messages describing what the pink jersey means to them. They were set to be printed on the jersey along with tweets from Ivan Basso, Cadel Evans, Alberto Contador, and Vincenzo Nibali, in the respective riders' native languages. Ten tweets – six to be printed in Italian, two in English, and one each in Spanish and French – were eventually chosen by fan voting.\nContador's results stripped.\nAlberto Contador rode the Giro with full knowledge that he was to answer to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) regarding his positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, since his national federation cleared him of doping charges but both the UCI and the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) chose to appeal the ruling. He rode and won with the most dominant Grand Tour performance of his career, and later rode a relatively normal and full 2011 season as his CAS date was continually pushed back. It was originally scheduled for June, to occur soon enough to decide conclusively his status prior to the 2011 Tour de France, but it was instead pushed back to August and then again to November.\nThe hearing was at last held in November, with a verdict expected in January 2012. This, however, was also subject to a delay. Finally, on 6 February 2012, the court spoke, overturning the Spanish federation's decision to clear Contador and assessing the rider a backdated two-year ban, from the date of his adverse test at the 2010 Tour de France. The backdated ban meant any results obtained from the time of that test to the time the court announced its verdict were to be vacated and awarded in turn to previously second-placed riders. This effectively made Michele Scarponi the new Giro champion and points winner, and it made José Rujano and Vincenzo Nibali into stage winners in this Giro. The decision was reminiscent of that handed down in the Alessandro Petacchi case from the 2007 Giro d'Italia. The court's ruling opinion was that the minute amount of clenbuterol found was probably not caused by a doping regimen, but that strict liability rules meant that Contador had nonetheless violated WADA's World Anti-Doping Code. The court held that the adverse finding itself was never in doubt, but merely how the substance had entered the athlete's body. This was not a matter under which they could exonerate him.\nReaction to the decision, and to the protracted nature of the case itself, was widespread and negative. Five-time Giro winner Eddy Merckx expressed surprise at the result and disappointment that it could further sully the sport's image, saying \"It's like someone wants to kill cycling.\" Since-ousted race director Angelo Zomegnan called the decision to strip the Giro championship \"nonsense\", noting that Contador was permitted to ride at the time and there were no irregularities of any kind during the race. His successor Michele Acquarone was also upset by the decision, believing that damage had been done to the Giro and noting that RCS Sport would need to commission a new trophy to award to Scarponi.\nScarponi, as well as John Gadret, the rider elevated onto the podium now in third place overall, both expressed sympathy for Contador and the feeling that being awarded these prestigious results in a court of law nearly a year after the race concluded kept them from feeling as good as they would were they attained on the road. Both Scarponi's overall championship and Gadret's podium finish constituted the first such results for either of them in a Grand Tour. Gadret, who had supported Contador's presence in the Giro peloton when the race began, reconsidered his position in hindsight, saying the Spaniard's attendance irrevocably changed the race. Further reactions from other personalities within the sport toward the ruling and the case itself were near universally negative. WADA celebrated the decision, calling the court \"robust and thorough\" in its jurisprudence of the World-Anti Doping Code.\nClassification leadership.\nIn the 2011 Giro d'Italia, four different jerseys were awarded. For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, and allowing time bonuses for the first three finishers on mass-start stages, the leader received a pink jersey. This classification was considered the most important of the Giro d'Italia, and the winner was considered the winner of the Giro.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage. Unlike in the better known points classification in the Tour de France, the type of stage had no effect on what points were on offer – each stage had the same points available on the same scale. The win earned 25 points, second place earned 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th. In addition, points could be won in intermediate sprints.\nThere was also a mountains classification, the leadership of which was marked by a green jersey. In the mountains classifications, points were won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorized as either first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorized climbs. The \"Cima Coppi\", the race's highest point of elevation, awarded still more points than the other first-category climbs.\nThe fourth jersey represented the young rider classification, marked by a white jersey. This was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1986 were eligible.\nThere were also three classifications for teams. In the Trofeo Fast Team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time; the Trofeo Super Team was a team points classification, with the top 20 placed riders on each stage earning points (20 for first place, 19 for second place and so on, down to a single point for 20th) for their team; and the Fair Play classification rewarded those teams that best avoided penalty points for minor technical infringements.\nThe rows in the following table correspond to the jerseys awarded after that stage was run, and shows to whom each jersey would have been awarded each day had Alberto Contador been removed from the standings as the race was ongoing.\nFinal standings.\nMinor classifications.\nOther less well-known classifications, whose leaders did not receive a special jersey, were awarded during the Giro. These awards were based on points earned throughout the three weeks of the tour. Each mass-start stage had one intermediate sprint, the \"Traguardo Volante\", or T.V. The T.V. gave bonus seconds towards the general classification, points towards the regular points classification, and also points towards the T.V. classification. This award was known by various names in previous years, and was previously time-based. It was won by Jan Bakelants of the team.\nOther awards included the Combativity classification, which was a compilation of points gained for position on crossing intermediate sprints, mountain passes and stage finishes. Original general classification winner Alberto Contador won this award at the race's conclusion; upon his disqualification it passed to mountains category winner Stefano Garzelli. The Azzurri d'Italia classification was based on finishing order, but points were awarded only to the top three finishers in each stage. It was originally won, like the closely associated points classification, by Contador, and passed to José Rujano when the Spaniard's results were stripped. Additionally, the \"Trofeo Fuga Pinarello\" rewarded riders who took part in a breakaway at the head of the field, each rider in an escape of ten or fewer riders getting one point for each kilometre that the group stayed clear. 's Yaroslav Popovych was first in this competition. Teams were given penalty points for minor technical infringements. Six different teams – , , , , , and  – avoided incurring penalties over the course of the race, and so shared in winning the Fair Play classification.\nWorld Rankings points.\nThe Giro was one of 27 events throughout the season that contributed points towards the 2011 UCI World Tour. Points were awarded to the top 20 finishers overall, and to the top five finishers in each stage.\nIn early 2012, the points earned by Contador for overall placing were redistributed, and those gained for stage finishes were removed. Riders from non-World Tour teams, who were not initially allocated points, received them. "

        "text": "John Alfred Ford (17 February 1906 – 20 February 1985) was a rugby union player who represented Australia.\nFord, a number eight, was born in Sheffield, Tasmania and claimed a total of 11 international rugby caps for Australia. His brother Eric was also an Australian rugby union representative player.\nFamily and early life.\nOne of three children, his publican father died when Jack was aged four and the family moved from Tasmania to Sydney. Together with his brothers Eric and Percy, Jack Ford became a boarder at St Joseph's College where he learned his rugby under the guidance of the legendary Brother Henry. He was a good student and won a College bursary which allowed him to attend College for a total of eight years. He was an outstanding cricketer and boxer while at school and matured to an ideal physique for all these sports.\nRugby career.\nAfter leaving school, he joined the Glebe-Balmain Club with his brothers. At 20 he made his debut for NSW against New Zealand and made an immediate impression with his explosive running, which led to his selection in the 1927–28 Waratahs tour of the British Isles, France and Canada. On that tour, among a veritable firmament of rugby stars, Ford stood out for his great vision, which identified opposition weaknesses. When the Waratahs were within striking distance, canny captain Johnnie Wallace, Ford's team-mate at Glebe-Balmain, invariably pulled Jack Ford out of the pack to play at second five-eighth. With his flashing speed, immense strength and sheer size (he was by far the biggest man in the Waratah team), he was virtually unstoppable and scored twelve tries from this tactic in twenty-four matches on tour as well as setting up many more for others to score after he had made the break.\nJack Ford's career continued in 1929 when he played for the first Australian team to win all internationals against New Zealand. In a great Australian pack, his was the stroke of genius and he scored tries in each of the final two Tests with his pace, strength and uncanny ability to read the game.\nHe retired in 1930, a winner in eight of his last nine Tests after Australia's win over the 1930 British Lions. He had played in addition to all his representative games, a total of 65 games for Glebe-Balmain and Drummoyne. The Welsh Rugby Union sent him a set of scarlet red jumpers to mark the change in the Club name from Glebe-Balmain to Drummoyne and the Club still plays in those scarlet colours to this day.\nRecognition.\nIn 1999, for the 125th Anniversary Celebration of the foundation of the New South Wales Rugby Union in the Southern Hemisphere, a panel of experts was asked to select the best XV that had ever appeared for New South Wales and Australia. Without exception, Jack Ford's name came up as the greatest ever number eight.\nHe was inducted into the Australian Rugby Hall of Fame in 2016."

Bristol Handball faced Manchester (one of the top three ranked teams in the country) in their quarter-final tie and lost narrowly 30–25.\nBristol Handball Club lost out on promotion to England's top level in 2011/2012 at the final hurdle, losing out in the play-offs. This being their most successful season to-date.\n2015/16.\nIn 2015/16 Bristol Handball Club and local rivals Bath University thought closely for the league, however it was down to games between the two clubs that ended with Bath winning and Bristol finishing second in the SW Development League.\n2016/17.\nA mixed season for the players of both men's and ladies teams in 2016/17, with the men finishing fourth in the South West Regional Development League and the ladies finishing fifth.\n2017/18.\nThe start of 2017/18 season saw a lot of player changes, with new players coming in and a number of the international students heading home. The league itself was also rebranded as the Regional League South West.\nThe men's team had an excellent year, registering their first victory over Bath University for a number of years and ending up as Champions with 5 more points than runners up and last year's champions South Wales. At the end of the season, Bristol played Chelsea at the Derby Arena for a place in the National League South and in a hard-fought and exciting game, Bristol were victorious winning 36–32 to secure promotion.\nThe ladies team also had a strong season with a number of excellent victories through the season, beating all teams in the league at least once, apart from champions Reading, who were promoted to the Premier Handball League.

In the National Cup, they took on Islington Handball Club and Chelsea Handball Club, before eventually succuming to winners to be, NEM Hawks. \nFor Bristol Women's they entered into a transitional phase, looking to get more players into the team. With new editions to the club once more, they became a competitive team again, which hadn't been seen for a few years, playing host to a number of exciting games over the season, laying the foundations for future teams to come."

        "text": "Milbourne King Block, Sr. -- known as King Block (April 11, 1929 – October 6, 2014)—was an American college football player and coach. He was the head coach at Arkansas State College (now ASU) from 1960 to 1962 and amassed a 13–14 record.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Superior, Nebraska, Block earned 12 athletic letters at Twin Falls High School in south central Idaho, and graduated in 1947. He played college football at the University of Idaho in Moscow, where he was a fullback under head coach Dixie Howell. Block played on the varsity from 1948 to 1950, and was named to the All-Coast football team. He was selected in the 21st round of the 1951 NFL Draft by the Detroit Lions. At Idaho, he was a member of Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity, and graduated with a degree in education.\nCoaching career.\nAfter a coaching stint at Grangeville High School in north central Idaho, Block joined the Arkansas State coaching staff as the backfield assistant in 1955, under head coach Gene Harlow, who had been the guards coach at Idaho while Block was in college. Block was promoted to head coach in February 1960 and compiled a 13–14 record in three seasons. His offense was described as primarily reliant upon \"the running of the fullback and quarterback.\"\nHe resigned after the 1962 season to become the defensive line coach at Nebraska under head coach Bob Devaney. Arkansas State replaced Block with defensive backs coach Bennie Ellender. After one season in Lincoln, Block joined the staff of new head coach Bert Clark at Washington State in 1964 and remained in Pullman through 1967. He later served as an assistant at Iowa State until 1972. Aside from coaching football, Block also competed in rodeo events and bred quarterhorses, which he later parlayed into \"King Blocks Korral,\" one of the largest western stores in Iowa.\nDeath.\nAfter a lengthy illness, Block died in 2014 at age 85 in Ozark, Missouri; his remains were cremated."

        "text": "In basketball, an assist is a pass to a teammate that directly leads to a score by field goal. The top 25 highest assists totals in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I men's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". Assists are a relatively new statistic in college basketball, having only become an official statistic beginning with the 1983–84 season. Therefore Billy Allen, who split his career between SMU and Nevada and amassed 940 assists during his career between 1978 and 1983, is not officially recognized in the all-time ranks.\nAccording to the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball media guide, there were also two seasons in the early 1950s in which assists were recorded: 1950–51 and 1951–52.\nThe all-time leader in career assists is Bobby Hurley of Duke. He recorded 1,076 assists in 140 games (7.68 per game average) between 1989–90 and 1992–93. He also led the Blue Devils to consecutive national championships in 1991 and 1992. Second on the list is Chris Corchiani of NC State, another Atlantic Coast Conference school. In his four seasons, Corchiani compiled 1,038 assists. Only two other players besides Hurley and Corchiani have recorded 1,000 career assists at the Division I level: Ed Cota of North Carolina (1,030) and Jason Brickman (1,009) of LIU Brooklyn. Sherman Douglas of Syracuse is the only player on this list who also recorded 20 or more assists in a single game at both the Division I and National Basketball Association levels. For his college career, he played in 138 games while recording 960 assists."

        "title": "Royal Rumble (2011)",
        "text": "The 2011 Royal Rumble was the 24th annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on January 30, 2011, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. As has been customary since 1993, the Royal Rumble match winner received a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For the 2011 event, the winner received their choice to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVII. This was the last Royal Rumble held under the first brand extension, which ended in August, but was reinstated in July 2016.\nFour matches were featured on the event's supercard, a scheduling of more than one main event. The main event was the 2011 Royal Rumble match, which featured 40 participants from both brands instead of the usual number of 30—it has thus far been the only Royal Rumble match to have 40 participants. It was won by SmackDown's Alberto Del Rio, who last eliminated Raw's Santino Marella. The primary match on the Raw brand was for the WWE Championship, between reigning champion The Miz and Randy Orton, which Miz won to retain the title. The primary match on the SmackDown brand was Edge versus Dolph Ziggler for the World Heavyweight Championship, which Edge won to retain the title. The other featured match on the card was a fatal four-way match for the WWE Divas Championship in which Natalya defended the title against Eve Torres, Layla, and Michelle McCool; Torres won to win the championship. This event was notable for the returns of Booker T who left the company in 2007 and Kevin Nash, in his first WWE appearance since 2003 who also appeared in his Diesel persona since the 1996 event.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nThe Royal Rumble is an annual gimmick pay-per-view (PPV) produced every January by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) since 1988. It is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, SummerSlam, and Survivor Series, dubbed the \"Big Four\". It is named after the Royal Rumble match, a modified battle royal in which the participants enter at timed intervals instead of all beginning in the ring at the same time. The 2011 event was the 24th event in the Royal Rumble chronology and was scheduled to be held on January 30, 2011, at the TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. It featured wrestlers from the Raw and SmackDown brands.\nThe Royal Rumble match generally features 30 wrestlers, but for 2011, the match was instead scheduled to have 40 participants. Traditionally, the winner of the match earns a world championship match at that year's WrestleMania. For 2011, the winner could choose to challenge for either Raw's WWE Championship or SmackDown's World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania XXVII.\nStorylines.\nThe card included matches that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters to build tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's television shows, \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\".\nIn addition to the Royal Rumble match, the main rivalry from the Raw brand involved the WWE Champion The Miz defending his title against Randy Orton. The night after Survivor Series, The Miz cashed in his Money in the Bank contract and defeated Orton to become the WWE Champion before successfully defending it against Orton a month later at . After defeating Wade Barrett and Sheamus in a Steel Cage match on an episode of \"Raw\", Orton received another opportunity at the title in a match against The Miz.\nThe main rivalry from the SmackDown brand involved the World Heavyweight Champion Edge defending his title against Dolph Ziggler. After defeating \"Dashing\" Cody Rhodes, Drew McIntyre, and Big Show, Ziggler won a title opportunity for Edge's World Heavyweight Championship after Kane lost to Edge in his rematch. After winning his opportunity, Edge went on a campaign against Ziggler and his girlfriend, Edge's ex-wife, Vickie Guerrero. On the January 28 episode of \"SmackDown\", Vickie Guerrero, who was the acting General Manager in place of the injured Theodore Long, banned the use of the spear and would strip him of his title if he was caught using it during his match against Ziggler.\nThe Divas rivalry entering the Royal Rumble was between Natalya and LayCool over the Divas Championship. Natalya defeated LayCool in a handicap match at Survivor Series to win the Divas Championship, and she would later team with Beth Phoenix in defeating LayCool in a Divas tag team Tables Match at TLC. On the December 20 episode of \"Raw\", Melina turned heel after defeating Eve Torres and Alicia Fox in a #1 Contender's Triple Threat Match, when she slapped Natalya after the match. On the January 24 episode, Natalya successfully defended the title against Melina, and after the match ended, LayCool entered and announced that they would cash in their rematch clause at the Royal Rumble event.\nEvent.\nIn a dark match prior to the pay-per-view broadcast, R-Truth defeated Curt Hawkins.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with Edge defending the World Heavyweight Championship against Dolph Ziggler, with the stipulation that Edge would lose the World Heavyweight Championship should he use the Spear. Edge applied the \"Edgecator\" on Ziggler but Ziggler touched the ring ropes, forcing Edge to break the hold. Ziggler performed a Leg Drop Bulldog on Edge for a near-fall. Ziggler applied a Sleeper Hold on Edge but Edge escaped and performed an \"Edgecution\" on Ziggler. Edge pinned Ziggler, but Vickie Guerrero pulled the referee, voiding the pinfall at a two count. Whilst Kelly Kelly attacked Guerrero, Ziggler performed a \"Zig Zag\" on Edge for a near-fall. Ziggler applied another Sleeper Hold on Edge, but Edge collided with the referee, allowing Edge to perform a \"Spear\" on Ziggler. Edge performed \"Killswitch\" on Ziggler to retain the title.\nNext, The Miz defended the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. During the match, Orton attempted an RKO, but Miz countered and attempted a \"Skull Crushing Finale\" but Orton countered and performed an Olympic Slam on The Miz. The Miz retrieved the WWE Championship belt and attempted to walk away, but Orton performed a Clothesline on Miz. Orton performed an Elevated DDT on Miz and The Nexus (CM Punk, Husky Harris, Michael McGillicutty, David Otunga, and Mason Ryan) appeared. Whilst the referee was distracted by The Nexus, Orton threw Alex Riley onto The Nexus and the referee. Orton performed an \"RKO\" on Miz but Punk performed a \"GTS\" on Orton. When the referee recovered, Miz pinned Orton to retain the title.\nAfter that, Natalya defended the WWE Divas Championship against Layla, Michelle McCool, and Eve Torres in a fatal four-way match. Natalya applied a Double \"Sharpshooter\" on Eve and Layla but McCool performed a \"Big Boot\" on Natalya. McCool attempted another \"Big Boot\" on Natalya but Natalya avoided the move, resulting in McCool hitting Layla. Eve performed a Diving Moonsault on Layla to win the title.\nMain event.\nThe main event was the 40-man Royal Rumble match for a world championship match at WrestleMania XXVII. CM Punk entered at #1 and The Corre (Wade Barrett, Ezekiel Jackson, Justin Gabriel, and Heath Slater) then came out and attacked Punk. The Nexus came out and fought with The Corre before the Anonymous Raw General Manager stopped the attack and threatened to disqualify both The Corre and The Nexus from the Royal Rumble match. The members of both groups headed out backstage as United States Champion Daniel Bryan entered at #2 to begin the match with Punk. Gabriel entered at #3 but was quickly eliminated by Bryan. John Morrison (#7) was almost eliminated by William Regal (#5), but held onto the barricade, walked across it and jumped over to the steps to stay in the match. As the match progressed, members of The Nexus began to enter including Husky Harris (#9), Michael McGillicutty (#13) and David Otunga (#15). Punk, Harris, McGillicutty and Otunga cleared out all the other competitors in the ring (Bryan, Chris Masters (#14), Morrison and Mark Henry (#11)). Punk then went on a string of eliminations, eliminating all of the next three entries, Tyler Reks (#16), Tag Team Champion Vladimir Kozlov (#17) and R-Truth (#18). The Great Khali entered at #19 and eliminated Harris, but the final Nexus member, Mason Ryan, came out afterwards at #20 and eliminated Khali. Booker T entered as a surprise entrant at #21, his first WWE appearance since late 2007, executing a Scissors Kick on Otunga and a Book End on McGillicutty and then performed his signature taunt, the Spinaroonie, but was eliminated by Ryan immediately afterwards. John Cena entered next at #22 and eliminated Ryan, Otunga and McGillicutty, leaving Punk on his own. After Hornswoggle entered at #23, Cena eliminated Punk (who lasted over 35 minutes and scored seven eliminations). A double-team by Cena and Hornswoggle led to Tyson Kidd (#24) and Heath Slater (#25) being quickly eliminated after Hornswoggle imitated Cena's signature moves on them.\nAs the ring filled up with superstars, Diesel entered at #32 as a surprise entrant, his first appearance in WWE since SummerSlam 2003, but was eliminated by Wade Barrett (#30). Alex Riley entered at #34, the WWE Champion The Miz coming out with him to sit on commentary. Riley was mistakenly eliminated early by Cena and Intercontinental Champion Kofi Kingston (#26). The other half of the Tag Team Champions Santino Marella entered at #37, but was hit with a Brogue Kick on entry by Sheamus (#28), and rolled under the bottom rope out of the ring. Alberto Del Rio entered at #38, but slowly approached the ring. This led to the next entrant, Randy Orton, coming out and attacking Del Rio before throwing him into the ring. Orton executed an RKO on Sheamus and another one on Kingston before eliminating both. Kane entered as the final competitor at #40 and eliminated Ezekiel Jackson (#36). Kane was eliminated by Rey Mysterio (#29), but Mysterio was then eliminated himself by Barrett.\nCena, Barrett, Del Rio, and Orton were left as the assumed final four. Riley, who was eliminated earlier, came back out and distracted Cena, which allowed Miz, who had still been on commentary, to eliminate Cena from behind, and he rushed backstage with Riley. Orton fought with Barrett and Del Rio, gaining the upper hand and executing his signature moves. Orton eliminated Barrett, but Del Rio quickly eliminated Orton immediately afterwards and began celebrating. However, Marella, who had been laying outside the ring ever since he was struck by Sheamus' Brogue Kick, came back into the ring after the referees realised he was still in. Del Rio turned around confused and was hit by the Cobra and Marella began celebrating prematurely. Marella went for the elimination on Del Rio, but Del Rio managed to roll out of the way at the last moment, pulling down the top rope and eliminating Marella to finally win the match. This Royal Rumble match was the longest in its history until the 50-man Royal Rumble match at Greatest Royal Rumble in 2018.\nReception.\nRoyal Rumble received positive reviews, most notably from Arda Ocal and Jim Korderas of Right After Wrestling on SIRIUS Radio 98, who called it one of the best Royal Rumble matches in recent memory. \nSLAM! Wrestling writers Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk shared similar compliments to the event, praising the short, though crowd-pleasing appearances of Kevin Nash and Booker T. Overall, they also awarded the event a score of 8.5/10. The event received 476,000 buys, up from the previous year's 465,000.\nAftermath.\nIn April 2011, the promotion ceased using its full name with the \"WWE\" abbreviation becoming an orphaned initialism. In August, the brand split was dissolved, thus the 2011 Royal Rumble was the last Royal Rumble held during the first brand extension. However, the brand split would be reinstated in July 2016. Additionally, the 2011 Royal Rumble has thus far been the only Royal Rumble to have a 40-man Royal Rumble match. Only one other Royal Rumble match has had more participants, which was the 50-man Greatest Royal Rumble match held at the Greatest Royal Rumble event in April 2018. Although similar and although the match had the same rules, it is not part of the Royal Rumble's PPV chronology.\nResults.\nRoyal Rumble entrances and eliminations.\n The Miz was not a participant in the Royal Rumble match."

A small ground, it is bordered to the east by Macclesfield District General Hospital and to the south and west by housing. The ground is used by Macclesfield Cricket Club. Field hockey and lawn bowls are also played at the ground.\nHistory.\nMacclesfield Cricket Club has been in existence for over 180 years, though where the club originally played is unknown. The first recorded match on the current ground came in Cheshire's first match there in the 1921 Minor Counties Championship against Staffordshire. Cheshire played an annual Minor Counties Championship at the ground until 1931. Minor counties cricket did not return to the ground until 1949, when Cheshire played the Worcestershire Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. Cheshire played annually at the ground throughout the 1950s and 1960s. It was in the 1966 Gillette Cup that the ground held its first List A match when Cheshire played first-class opponents in the form of Lancashire. Two further List A matches were held there in the 1968 Gillette Cup, with Cheshire defeating Norfolk in a first round match, but losing to Northamptonshire in the second round. A final List A match was held there in 1974, when the ground was selected as a home venue for Minor Counties North in the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup, with Lancashire as the visitors. The ground continued to host Minor Counties Championship matches during the 1970s, with the final Minor Counties Championship match held in 1982. In 1983, the ground held the first final of the MCCA Knockout Trophy, which saw Cheshire triumph over Bedfordshire. A second MCCA Knockout Trophy match was held in 1984, with Hertfordshire as the visitors. This was the last time the ground was used by Cheshire.\nIn latter years the ground has had to contend with deteriorating facilities. In 2003, plans were drawn up for Macclesfield Cricket Club to sell the ground for development and move to a new ground along London Road. However these plans failed to come to fruition. In 2011, plans were drawn up to transform the ground into one of the leading leisure facilities in Cheshire, with the undertaking of an £800,000 redevelopment project."

        "title": "Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground",
        "text": "Ellerman Lines Cricket Ground was a cricket ground at the end of Carr Lane in Hoylake, Cheshire, now in Merseyside. The ground was surrounded by countryside on at least three sides, with the houses in George Road along the western flank of the ground built at some point during the period when the ground was in use. The cricket ground has been disused for approximately forty years.\nHistory.\nThe ground was the original home of West Wirral Cricket Club when it formed in the 1920s. By 1952, the club was struggling with the upkeep costs associated with the ground, and sold it to shipping company Ellerman Lines. Ellerman Lines made a significant investment in the ground, transforming it into their social club. The original cricket club moved to a different ground, but the cricket oval itself was retained. Cheshire first played minor counties cricket at the ground in the 1957 Minor Counties Championship against Northumberland. With the exception of 1958, Cheshire played one Minor Counties Championship match annually there, with their final match in 1968 coming against the Yorkshire Second XI. A single List A match was played there in the first round of the 1964 Gillette Cup between Cheshire and Surrey, in what was Cheshire's first appearance in List A cricket. Surrey won the toss and elected to bat first, making 171/8 in their innings, with John Edrich top-scoring with 70, while Norman Halsall was the most effective Cheshire bowler with figures of 2/37 from thirteen overs. Cheshire were dismissed for 109 in their chase, with Roy Collins top-scoring with 58. David Sydenham took figures of 4/6 from nine overs, including 4 wickets in 5 balls, which included a hat-trick. This was the second hat-trick to be taken in List A cricket.\nCricket ceased to be played at the ground in the early 1970s, with its use as a social club continuing for a short time thereafter. By the late 1970s, Ellerman Lines were struggling financially, with the ground being sold off around this time. The social club was subsequently transformed into a nightclub by its new owners, however this venture too failed. In 1985 the playing field served as a training ground for the Wirral Wolves American Football club and was being considered as a potential venue for their home fixtures only for a site in Arrowe Park to be preferred. The main building later caught fire and was demolished. The top soil was stripped from the site at some point, with rubble and other materials dumped on the site. In November 2011, a plan was drawn up to develop the site with 62 affordable homes. This plan met with some local controversy, with some local Councillors seeing it as a threat to plans to develop a new golf resort in the vicinity. Planning permission for these 62 properties, and a revised plan for 26 homes, were refused. In 2020 a further planning proposal was submitted for 30 semi-detached bungalows and up to 61 assisted living retirement apartments."

        "text": "Hyde Park was a cricket ground in Sheffield on a site now used for high-rise community flats. It took the name of fields that occupied the area in the early 19th century. Hyde Park was used for important matches between 1830 and 1854. It opened in 1826 and was adopted by Sheffield Cricket Club as a home venue, replacing Darnall New Ground, from 1830 until 1854. It was itself superseded in April 1855 by Bramall Lane. Hyde Park staged the first \"Roses Match\" between Yorkshire and Lancashire in July 1849.\nCricket ground.\nThe first recorded match on the ground took place from 30 August to 1 September 1830 between Sheffield and Nottingham, Sheffield winning by 41 runs. Sheffield used the ground several times for important matches, their last one there being against Manchester on 26 and 27 July 1852, Sheffield winning by an innings and 22 runs.\nMost of Sheffield's matches were against other town clubs, notably Manchester and Nottingham, but from 1833 they began to take on teams that represented counties and, for these matches, Sheffield called themselves Yorkshire. As such, the first inter-county match involving a Yorkshire team was against Norfolk at Hyde Park from 2 to 5 September 1833, Yorkshire winning by 120 runs. Hyde Park staged the first \"Roses Match\" between Yorkshire and Lancashire on 23–25 July 1849, Yorkshire winning by 5 wickets. The last match at Hyde Park by a Yorkshire team was on 6 and 7 June 1853 against the United England Eleven (UEE). It was an \"odds match\" as Yorkshire used 14 players; the UEE won by an innings and 36 runs. The last known match of any kind on the ground was on 4 and 5 June 1866 when a team of 18 Nottingham and Sheffield Colts combined to play against the All-England Eleven (AEE).\nAfterwards.\nSoon afterwards, Hyde Park was acquired by the Hallamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps as their drill ground. W. G. Grace played in the Colts v. AEE match as a guest player and captained the Colts XVIII. He recalled Hyde Park in his \"Recollections\" (published in 1899), saying: \"The ground stood on the top of a high hill, and I began to despair of the cab ever getting to the top\".\nIn its heyday, Hyde Park covered five and a half acres and so could stage several matches concurrently. Situated on high ground, as Grace said, it was known for \"its splendid views and rapid draining and drying\". Its ability to stage \"massed cricket\" emulated Parker's Piece and the Bombay Maidan as up to 200 cricketers could be playing there at any one time.\nThe site was later converted to the Hyde Park Greyhound Stadium in 1933 until 1980."

        "title": "West Hendford Cricket Ground",
        "text": "West Hendford Cricket Ground was a first-class cricket ground in Yeovil, Somerset. The land for the ground was first leased by Yeovil Cricket Club in 1874 and was also used for a range of other sports, most significantly hosting Yeovil Rugby Club in the 1890s and then again from 1935 until the ground was closed. Significant improvements were made to the ground during the 1930s, including the opening of a new pavilion jointly funded by the Rugby and Cricket clubs. The ground was demolished in 1944 when Westland Aircraft extended their factory, and both Yeovil Cricket Club and Rugby Club moved to Johnson Park.\nBetween 1935 and 1939, the ground hosted five annual Somerset County Cricket Club matches in July or August, the first of which nearly broke a county record for ticket sales on the gate. Somerset won only one of the five matches, the 1936 contest against Worcestershire.\nHistory.\nYeovil and County Cricket Club was formed in 1865 and was the first attempt at setting up a county cricket team for Somerset. The attempt was unsuccessful, and the club broke up. In 1874, the club was re-formed with the lesser remit, as Yeovil Cricket Club. As part of the club's resuscitation, the committee purchased the use of a field in West Hendford in Yeovil, from a local farmer, Mr Brook. The field, part of Key Farm, was leased for £10. There is record of a match being played on the ground the following year between two sets of members of the Yeovil Cricket Club. During the late 19th century, the ground was used for other sports as well as cricket; it had a grass athletics track, and also hosted Yeovil Football Club, who at the time played both association and rugby football. The football club played at West Hendford on an irregular basis during the late 19th century, but returned in 1935, by which time they only played rugby, and had changed their name accordingly to Yeovil Rugby Club. In 1895, the cricket club committee announced that there was provision for a longer lease, of five or seven years, and that they would make improvements to the ground to enable it to host first-class cricket. The ground was also used for field hockey in the early 20th-century, hosting a Yeovil Hockey Club.\nIn 1932 the ground hosted greyhound racing after it switched from Barwick Fields. The racing was organised by the Salisbury Greyhound Race Club and the racing was Independent (unaffiliated to a governing body).\nSomerset County Cricket Club played their first of five annual first-class matches on the ground in 1935. The match, against Surrey, was a significant event in the town, and a series of festivities were arranged to run alongside the three-day contest, including a dance and a smoking concert. Entry for the match, which took place from 17 to 19 August was one shilling, and attracted over 5,000 people, raising around £400. Surrey won the match by eight wickets. The takings from this match helped the Yeovil Cricket Club make further improvements to the ground, expanding it and adding further seating. The following year, Somerset played Worcestershire at the ground, in what the \"Western Gazette\" described as \"Yeovil Cricket Festival\". The captain of Yeovil Cricket Club, Richard Southcombe, was included in the Somerset team, which won the match by 170 runs. The takings were slightly lower than the previous year due to poor weather, but still described as \"gratifying\".\nIn 1937, Sussex beat Somerset at the ground, in a match that once again drew a crowd of around 5,000. The \"Yorkshire Evening Post\" described the wicket as \"crumbling\" towards the end of the match, favouring the bowlers. In 1938 Hampshire visited, and the report in the \"Western Daily Press\" lamented the state of the wicket, which meant that the game, like the three first-class matches at the ground before it, was completed in two days, rather than the scheduled three. That winter, a new pavilion costing £550 was erected on the ground for the shared use of the cricket club and the rugby club. The final first-class match on the ground was played in July 1939 against Lancashire, but torrential rain limited the match to only three hours of play. The takings for the full three days of the match were only £87, and the \"Taunton Courier\" estimated that the losses for the match could be hundreds of pounds. Despite the weather, almost 2,000 people attended the match, and the \"Taunton Courier\" report praised the alterations that had been made to the ground; the removal of a hedge made the ground lighter, while the ground itself had been well looked after, and drained quickly. The Second World War suspended the County Championship from 1940 to 1945, and during that time, Westland Aircraft took over the ground to expand their factory, and informed Yeovil Cricket Club that it was no longer available, forcing them to search for a new ground in 1946. They eventually relocated to the newly opened Johnson Park in 1948. The rugby club also moved to Johnson Park, amalgamating itself into Yeovil Sports Club. After a short break, Somerset County Cricket Club returned to Yeovil, playing fourteen fixtures at Johnson Park between 1951 and 1970, and eight matches at Westlands Sports Ground from 1971 to 1978.\nRecords.\nDuring its limited use as a first-class cricket ground, only one century was scored on the ground, by Jim Parks. During the 1937 match, he scored 140 runs for Sussex. The most wickets taken by a bowler in a match at West Hendford was achieved in 1938, when Hampshire's Stuart Boyes took twelve wickets, including nine in the first innings. Somerset's only success on the ground was in 1936 against Worcestershire, who they dismissed for 60 runs in the first innings, and 77 in the second."

        "text": "William H. Marshall (October 24, 1887 - November 24, 1926) was the founder and long-time head coach of the Detroit Heralds (renamed the Detroit Tigers in 1921) of the early National Football League. Marshall, as a student at the University of Detroit, founded the Heralds in 1905, as an amateur team, after the university didn't field a team that year due to financial issues. While the university's football team resumed play in 1906, the Heralds continued to play as an amateur team. In 1911, the team dropped its amateur status and became semi-professional and left the campus. The team would go on to regularly play teams from the \"Ohio League\", namely the Canton Bulldogs and Massillon Tigers. In 1920, the American Professional Football Association (later renamed the National Football League in 1922) was established. While the Heralds didn't officially join the association, they are listed in league standings for the season. The Heralds, under Marshall, had a 1–3 record, while inclement weather eliminated their November schedule, financially devastating the team. In 1921, the Heralds were reorganized into the Detroit Tigers. Marshall remained the team's head coach, however financial issues caused that team to fold by year's end."

        "title": "John Williams (snooker referee)",
        "text": "John Williams (born 8 June 1937) is a Welsh retired snooker referee. He presided over eleven World Snooker Championship finals, nine at the Crucible Theatre, including the 1985 final between Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis – the most watched snooker match in history. Having begun refereeing in the 1960s, Williams left the civil service in 1981 to work as a referee full-time. Having the chance to referee tournaments at Pontins, he quickly took charge and organised the events for many years. He gained national attention following a match between Fred Davis and Alex Higgins where the roof collapsed after rainfall and flooded the . Williams was pictured in many national newspapers after the event, resulting in more television coverage.\nHe was the longstanding referee for snooker television show \"Pot Black\", taking charge after Sydney Lee's retirement at the 1981 event. Williams was forced into retirement in 2002 due to contract negotiations with the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association, but made sporadic appearances at the World Seniors Championship until 2012.\nEarly life.\nOne of six siblings, Williams was born on 8 June 1937 in Ruabon, Wrexham, Wales. His father worked as a fan house attendant at Gresford Colliery, and his grandfather was British bar billiards champion in 1906. After passing his eleven-plus examination aged nine, Williams gained seven O Level qualifications at the end of his secondary education. He started work as a trainee metallurgist in the steel industry. He was offered the opportunity to join Bolton Wanderers F.C. as a professional football player, but declined the offer because his job in the local steelworks involved him working on Saturdays. After working in the steel industry for nearly 20 years, Williams became a civil servant at the Department of Employment, after a short stint employed in quality control at Pilkington Glass. He played snooker in a local league, and had a personal best of 73. He married Joyce and they had three sons and a daughter. Following a divorce, Williams married Kathleen.\nReferee career.\nWilliams started refereeing snooker matches during the mid-1960s, eventually leaving the civil service in 1981 to become a full-time referee. He was offered to referee matches at Pontins, where he began to run and organise the events for decades. At the 1973 World Snooker Championship, he refereed a quarter-final match between Fred Davis and Alex Higgins at the Manchester Exhibition Hall. The ceiling of the Hall was a glass dome, which had been covered in a tarpaulin to keep the sun off the table. Under the weight of rain, the dome broke and the table was flooded. This led to the press picturing Williams with the headline reading \"rain stops play\".\nHe refereed more World Snooker Championship finals than any other referee, his first at the Crucible Theatre being the 1978 final between Ray Reardon and Perrie Mans. Having also previously refereed the last session of the 1976 final, Williams took charge of eight other finals at the Crucible until 2002, including all three that went to a . He refereed the most viewed snooker match in history, the 1985 World Snooker Championship final between Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor where Taylor won on the final in the deciding frame. Williams was also the referee during Cliff Thorburn's maximum break against Terry Griffiths in 1983, the first maximum in the history of the competition.\nWilliams last refereed the World Championship final in 2002, when Peter Ebdon beat Stephen Hendry in a deciding frame. In total, he officiated 11 World finals, including part of the finals in 1975 and 1976. In 1983, Williams received a two-year suspended prison sentence, after pleading guilty to selling non-existent snooker tables worth £6,500. This led to the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) expelling him as a referee, however he later won a legal battle to be reinstated. In 2003, he sued the WPBSA for wrongful dismissal after the WPBSA contracts for referees included a mandatory retirement age of 64, at a time when Williams was 65. He had believed that he had an agreement with the WPBSA that meant he could continue to work, but his contract was terminated at the end of July 2002.\nAs the popularity of snooker on television grew during the 1980s, Williams became a household name along with fellow top referees Len Ganley, John Street and Alan Chamberlain. Between them, Ganley, Street and Williams refereed 17 of the first 20 World Championship finals held at the Crucible Theatre. After Sydney Lee's retirement in 1980, Williams became the referee of the snooker television show \"Pot Black\" for the 1981 edition. He remained in the role for the remainder of the series and its revivals during the 1990s. He made a return to snooker refereeing when he officiated matches in the 2011 World Seniors Championship, and returned for the 2012 tournament."

The club row in dark blue, with a vertical yellow stripe between two white stripes down both sides. Blades are dark blue with a lighter blue tip.\nHistory.\nUp until 2006, there were no clubs rowing in Leeds.

        "text": "The World Triathlon Sprint Championships is a triathlon competition covering distances of 750 m swim, 20 km bicycle and 5 km run and is organised by the World Triathlon. The inaugural championships took place in 2010. In 2011 the championship was held as an event as part of the 2011 ITU World Championship Series. Great Britain's Jonathan Brownlee was the male champion in both editions, while Swede Lisa Norden and Chilean Barbara Riveros Diaz won the first two women's championships. However, for every year after 2011 multiple sprint events were held as part of the World Triathlon Series with no delineation made between them, and so no title was awarded at sprint distances at the elite level. \nIn 2021 Bermuda, as one leg of the World Triathlon Championship Series was selected to host a combined World Triathlon Sprint &amp; Relay Championships, also incorporating the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships, and reintroducing a sprint championship in a new multi-race 'Eliminator' format, but the event was cancelled following COVID-19 restrictions. The combined event took place the following year in Montréal, Canada on 25 June 2022. \nThe Championships' eliminator format included multiple races of a super-sprint distance (300 m swim, 5 km bike and 2.5 km run) over several days of racing. Athletes begin by competing in super-sprint qualifiers with the top 10 finishers in each of two heats proceeding to the final. For those outside the top 10, a final repechages is held, where they compete again, with the top 10 again reaching the final for a final field of thirty. In the final, the eliminators adopt a 'Devil' format (from 'devil take the hindmost'). 30 athletes compete in the first super sprint, with the last ten eliminated; thirty minutes later a further super-sprint eliminates a further ten from the smaller field of twenty before the final super-sprint race of ten athletes is held to decide the World sprint title. Each elimination race lasts around 20 to 25 minutes, as compared to the hour for 'sprint' distance and 1 he 30 to 2 hour time frame of standard distance triathlon. The final day event therefore lasts approximately two and a half hours, but consists of multiple shorter, more intense races in which transition is unusually important.\nThe first eliminator format World Sprint champions in 2022 both represented Great Britain, Alex Yee in the male event, and Georgia Taylor-Brown in the women's equivalent."

Václav Chalupa of Czechoslovakia had been the runner-up all three years, as well as winning the 1989 Diamond Challenge Sculls. Joaquín Gómez of Mexico was the Pan American champion. Verdonk was also a Diamond Challenge winner in 1990. \nLatvia, Lebanon, and Turkey each made their debut in the event; some former Soviet republics competed together as the Unified Team. The United States made its 17th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThis rowing event was a single scull event, meaning that each boat was propelled by a single rower. The \"scull\" portion means that the rower used two oars, one on each side of the boat. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. \nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used since 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960. The ranking races expanded from the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964 to having four finals, \"D\" through \"A\", that ranked every boat. Additional \"C/D\" or consolation semifinals were added as well.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe winner of each heat is qualified for the \"A/B\" semifinals. 2nd–6th placed rowers advance to the repechage round.\nRepechage.\nThe first two of each heat qualified for the \"A/B\" semifinals. 3rd–5th placed rowers advanced to the \"C/D\" (consolation) semifinals.\nSemifinals.\nFor the Semifinals A/B, the top three of each heat advanced to Final A and 4th–6th placed rowers advanced to Final B.\nFor the Semifinals C/D, the top three of each heat advanced to Final C and 4th–5th placed rowers advanced to Final D."

        "title": "Rock Creek Park Golf Course",
        "text": "Rock Creek Park Golf Course (also known as Rock Creek Golf Course) is a golf course located in Washington, D.C., in the United States. The entire course lies within Rock Creek Park, a national park owned and maintained by the National Park Service division of the United States Department of the Interior.\nThe course is located at the intersection of 16th Street NW and Rittenhouse Street NW. The course is bordered by Military Road NW in the south, Rock Creek and Beach Drive NW on the west, Sherrill Drive NW on the north, and 16th Street NW in the east. Walter Reed Army Medical Center is immediately to the northwest.\nRock Creek Park Golf Course is one of three golf courses in Washington, D.C., all of which are owned by the National Park Service. The other two are East Potomac Park Golf Course and Langston Golf Course.\nCourse description.\nRock Creek Golf Course is known as a challenging course. The front nine holes are short par 4s and long par 3s, although the broad fairways have some elevation differences. The fairways of the back nine are tight, with dense deciduous woods on either side. The back nine has even larger elevation changes, and many of the greens are quite small. In 1996, \"The Washington Post\" described the course this way:\nServices at the course include a large putting green, snack bar, and golf school. Players have criticized the maintenance of the course. However, at least one reviewer says that Rock Creek's \"weedy fairways, shaggy greens, [and] no frills\" clubhouse is \"honest\" municipal golf.\nHistory.\nCitizens in the Brightwood neighborhood proposed building a golf course in Rock Creek Park in January 1905, some 15 years after its founding. The United States Army Corps of Engineers, which controlled the city and the parks within it at the time, approved the plan in November 1906 (although there was opposition, which believed money should be spent on public health projects first). Construction began in 1907.\nThe nine-hole course opened on July 1, 1909. The course's first clubhouse was a former farm house owned by Horatio Plant, and its first concessionaires were N.B. Frost and H.D. Miller. After a year, the concession was turned over to Severine G. Leoffler Sr., who had risen from extreme poverty to own a popular local restaurant and then begun managing National Park Service courses in the city in 1921. Leoffler would administer Rock Creek Park Golf Course and other city golf courses for the next four decades.\nRock Creek Golf Course proved popular in its first few years. In July 1924, the Corps of Engineers agreed to expand the course to 18 holes. However, construction needs were so extensive that the entire course was shuttered in December 1924. The 18-hole course re-opened in 1926; the first golfers to tee off were four members of the United States Congress, who hit the first ball at 5:53 a.m.\nThe clubhouse was damaged by fire in January 1933; it burned to the ground in March 1937. Maintenance of the course was a major problem in the 1940s. Golfers complained about the course so vehemently that U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands began an investigation and asked the Park Service to delay renewing the firm's contract. A consultant criticized the Leoffler firm's stewardship of the course. The firm built a new clubhouse on the course in 1965. In 1968, Leoffler told the Park Service to close the course, as it was making no money.\nThe number of rounds played at Rock Creek rose from 9,500 in 1979 to 41,500 in 1980, but the following year, the National Park Service threatened to close the course. A Park Service report concluded that the course had been allowed to seriously deteriorate since 1965, despite about $100,000 in course repairs in the past three years. The Leoffler company declined to renew its concessions contract in 1981, and the National Park Service said it would close the park without a new concessionaire. In mid-1982, however, a management team compose of local businessmen James R. Brock, Frank Coates, and William Torpey took over course management, leading to a significant increase in rounds played. The new management team lasted only a year. In late 1982, the National Park Service awarded the concession to a new company, Golf Course Specialists, Inc.\nRock Creek Golf Course came close to closing again in the 1990s. The National Park Service began soliciting public input on a new master plan for Rock Creek Park, the first such document in 80 years. The Park Service proposed four plans for comment, one of which would have closed the golf course. After eight years of debate and study, a new master plan was adopted which retained Rock Creek Park Golf Course.\nIn 2019, the back nine (holes 10-18) were closed indefinitely due to course conditions. The course's web site says \"The back 9 will be closed until safety renovations can be completed in a future long-term lease.\"\nIn 2020, the National Park Service signed an agreement with National Links Trust to operate the course along with the two other courses located in DC. The announcement says that they plan to \"construct a new practice area, redevelop the clubhouse, create new spaces for educational programs, redesign the course to reflect the original intent of designer William Flynn and construct an 18-hole putting course.\""

        "text": "Brent Valley Golf Club is a golf club located in Hanwell, West London. The club is an affiliated member of the English Golf Union and Middlesex Golf is based on the Brent Valley Golf course, which is owned by Ealing Council. The club also belongs to the National Association of Public Golf Clubs and Courses. In 2022 it was named Middlesex Golf Club of the Year.\nThe club is located within the large Brent Valley Golf Course, adjacent to further green open spaces Brent Valley Park, Brent Lodge Park, and West Middlesex Golf Course in Dormers Wells. The golf course inspired the name of the two adjacent residential tower blocks, Gleneagles Tower and St Andrews Tower.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1909 by Albert Toley (1855–1924). It was previously called Springfield Park Golf Club, but its name was changed when the course was expanded from 9 to 18 holes. In the 1800s the land on which Brent Valley was later to stand was owned by the Rector G.H. Glasse. The course was designed by JH Taylor in the early 1900s. At the first annual club dinner held on 5 April 1910 at the Trocodero, Hanwell membership was reported to be over 300. In 1933, the club won the Middlesex CGU Coronation Bowl in the second year it was played. In 1938, Ealing Council acquired the course to preserve it from being developed and a lease with Brent Valley Golf Club was signed. The new public course was opened on 20 July 1938 by the Mayor of Ealing. In 1966 the old clubhouse, the \"Dublin House\" was demolished by the council and the present one built and the course was remodeled to the present format. It was believed that the remodelling was carried out by Peter Alliss but he has stated that this was not the case. In 2009 the club celebrated its centenary, which was marked by a ceremonial tee-off by the then Mayor of Ealing, Barbara Yerolemou . The course is now run by a private contractor Everyone Active as of 1 October 2014, through a contract with Ealing Council. In 2022 it was named Middlesex Golf Club of the Year.\nAlbert Toley.\nAlbert Toley was Brent Valley Golf Club’s founder and first President, in 1909. Born in 1855 in Devon, he lived in The Grove in Hanwell from 1906, which it is believed was later used as Brent Valley’s club house and later renamed Dublin House. Albert was a public benefactor and property developer. But his first post in London was as a teacher at the United Westminster School near Victoria Station aged 17. In 1876 he took over the school’s sports and found that the school lacked playing fields. He had the idea of renting land, in Willesden, for the school’s games and sub-letting some of it to local sports clubs. Sensing demand from other clubs, he repeated the exercise with other land. So successful was the venture that he gave up his teaching job and acquired other sites. At one point he was managing over . One of the plots of land he acquired was later to become Brent Valley Golf Course, where he founded the club. Although he managed many other sites and founded other clubs, Brent Valley held a special place in his heart since he lived in The Grove, which was on the course, and he was the Club’s first president. Local newspapers report him playing in matches for Brent Valley, alongside his son Frank, against other local clubs with a handicap of 9 at the age of 64. Albert Toley died on 6 September 1924.\nThe Course.\nBrent Valley is a traditional parkland style golf course and while not the longest course in the area at 5446yards is designed to offer a good level of golf for all handicaps. The use of the natural land shape in the design of many of the holes with the addition strategically placed bunkers and hazards to challenge players of all levels."

        "title": "George Cobb (golf)",
        "text": "George W. Cobb, (July 2, 1914 – January 15, 1986) is a notable and prolific golf course designer who created the Par-3 course at Augusta National Golf Club among more than one hundred courses and renovated many, including his own early work. He strove to create attractive layouts that the average golfer would find enjoyable, not frustrating.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nCobb was born into a family of golfers in Savannah, Georgia, learned to play as a child and was a scratch golfer. He had an older brother, W.E. and a younger sister, Mary A.\nCobb attended the University of Georgia, where he played on the college golf team. He studied landscape architecture and graduated in 1937. He was hired by the National Park Service and worked as a landscape architect until 1941.\nMilitary.\nDuring World War II, Cobb was a Marine Corps engineering officer at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. Because he was an avid golfer and landscape architect, he was assigned the task of constructing a golf course for use in physical rehabilitation of injured GIs, but he had no experience in course design. Cobb was permitted to hire experienced course architect Fred Findlay to provide design assistance. Cobb handled the construction superintendent responsibilities on this and a subsequent course at Lejeune.\nIn 1946, Cobb designed and built the course at the Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point on his own, then was discharged from the Marines during 1947.\nVocation.\nAfter the experience provided by the military, Cobb decided that he enjoyed building golf courses. He started his own golf design business and created six courses, but when the Korean War escalated, he was recalled to active duty in 1951. Released from service, Cobb initially moved to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and was working on the Country Club of Sapphire Valley when he was hired to build the Green Valley Country Club. While working on Green Valley in the spring of 1956, he was offered and accepted a position as a director of Hollyridge Corporation, the developer. He and his family settled in Greenville, South Carolina, where they remained. In 1958 he was named general manager of the club, but resigned when his design business proliferated during 1960, when he had eight South Carolina courses under construction or being designed.\nAugusta.\nCobb's shortest course may actually be his most prominent creation.\nCobb was design consultant at Augusta National Golf Club from the mid-1950s and became good friends with Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts, chairman of Augusta National. The club decided to add a par 3, nine-hole course in 1958, which Alister MacKenzie had suggested in the 1930s. Cobb was asked to design it with input from Roberts, and the 1,060 yard \"little course\" opened in 1959. The \"Par-3 Contest\" has been held on Wednesday of Masters week since 1960. In fifty years of Masters play, no one has ever won the Par-3 and the main tournament in the same week.\nCobb added a fresh touch to the \"big course\" in 1967 and 1977. The only other Par 3 course Cobb ever designed was at Vestavia Country Club in Birmingham, Alabama.\nAssociate.\nJohn LaFoy grew up in Greenville, and was close friends with Cobb's son, George, Jr. LaFoy studied architecture and graduated from Clemson University in 1968. He apprenticed with George Cobb before the Vietnam War forced him into the service. Like Cobb, LaFoy chose the Marine Corps. After his discharge, LaFoy returned to work with Cobb, and in 1971, he became Cobb's partner. They collaborated on every subsequent course the firm built, and when Cobb's health began to fail in the early 1980s, he ran the company. After Cobb's death in 1986, LaFoy continued designing and remodeling courses, and in 1999, he served as president of the American Society of Golf Course Architects.\nPersonal.\nWhile he was stationed at Camp LeJeune, Cobb married and had a son, George, Jr. and a daughter, Virginia.\nCourses designed.\nThe following table is a (partial) list of courses that George Cobb either designed alone (prior to 1971) or co-designed with John LaFoy.\nClick arrow box in column heading to sort by that attribute."

        "text": "The first mention of golf in Russia dates back to the reign of Nicholas II. The first 18-hole golf course appeared in the suburban area of Nakhabino located near Moscow only in 1994. Today, there are 32 golf courses in Russia.\nRussian golfer Maria Verchenova was among the participants of the 2016 Olympic Games. In the 4th round, Maria made a hole-in-one and set a record of the Olympic course. A contender for the 2020 Olympic Games is Nina Pegova (PGA status). The ANCO \"International Center of Golf Tourism\" (Golf in Russia) deals with increasing the recognition on the world stage and raising the number of inbound golf tourists in the country.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Golf Federation (IGF) banned golfers from Russia from competing in tournaments under its jurisdiction. In addition, in March 2022 the European Golf Association announced that it would not allow teams, individuals, and officials from Russia to participate in EGA events in 2022, and that no EGA events were planned to take place in Russia.\nHistory.\nThe first golf course in the Russian Empire appeared in 1891 in village Murino, Saint Petersburg Governorate, at the place where \"Devyatkino\" railway station, named after the 9-hole course of the same name, is now located. The first golf club on the southern coast of France, Cannes Mandelieu Golf Club (modern Club Old Course Golf Cannes-Mandelieu) was founded in the 19th century by Grand Duke Mikhail Mikhailovich Romanov. After the revolution of 1917 this sport was forgotten for a long time.\nA new stage of the development of golf in Russia began with the establishment of the first Golf Club in Moscow.

These undefeated league champions won the 1996, 1997 and 1998 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships, becoming the first team to threepeat since Syracuse from 1988–90 and the first to be recognized to have done so without an NCAA scandal since Johns Hopkins from 1978–80.\nIn the 1996 NCAA championship quarterfinals, he scored five goals in the 22–6 victory over Towson State. In the 1996 semifinals, he scored a game-high six goals in an 11–9 victory over Syracuse, including a key goal after Syracuse tied the score at 9.

He served as co-captain of the 1998 team, and he scored a goal during the 1998 Championship game against Maryland. Massey holds the Princeton record for consecutive games with a goal (46) and remains second to Hubbard in career goals (146 vs. 163) at Princeton.\nProfessional career.\nMassey played with the New York Saints during the 1999 and 2000 NLL seasons.

Massey joined the New Jersey Pride later that season and played with them during the 2002 MLL season as well. He then played with the Long Island Lizards from 2003 through 2007 after they acquired him along with Jay Jalbert. He finished his career at the end of the 2007 season with the Los Angeles Riptide. Massey helped the Lizards win the 2003 MLL Steinfeld Cup championship. He works in the corporate litigation department at the New York and New Jersey offices of Bressler, Amery &amp; Ross. After graduating from Princeton, in 1998, he started at Brooklyn Law School in 2001 and worked at Bressler for the first two summers. He passed the New York and New Jersey bar examinations during the 2004 MLL season and subsequently began full-time employment at Bressler in September 2004.\nPersonal.\nMassey was a regular surfer on the Jersey Shore during his time at Princeton."

        "title": "Canterbury Cricket Week",
        "text": "Canterbury Cricket Week is the oldest cricket festival week in England and involves a series of consecutive Kent home matches, traditionally held in the first week in August. It was founded in 1842, although a similar festival week was first held in 1839 by the Beverley Cricket Club, the predecessor of Kent County Cricket Club. Since 1847 it has taken place at the St Lawrence Ground, Canterbury, before that it was held at the Beverley Ground in the same city. In addition to hosting cricket matches, it also includes several other events and ceremonies. As of 2018, there have been 167 Canterbury Cricket Weeks held. The week continued through the Second World War with cricket being held on the ground each season.\nThe politician and journalist Bill Deedes wrote in 2000: \"while the Second World War was on, I consoled myself by thinking that Canterbury Cricket Week, founded in 1842 with its tents and famous lime tree, unchanging in a changing world, was the sort of thing I was in business to preserve.\"\nTraditions.\nTraditionally Canterbury Cricket Week included a Ladies Day, with prizes being awarded for the best hat on the day, though in recent years this has been discontinued in line with changing social attitudes and the need to keep cricket relevant to a modern audience. The Kent Supporters Club lays a wreath each year, commemorating those who played for the county and died during the First and Second World Wars.\nThe Old Stagers amateur theatre group has close links with Canterbury Cricket Week, originally being formed to perform at the festival.\nImpact.\nCanterbury Cricket Week usually has Kent's highest attendance at the St. Lawrence Ground. It was once considered a major commercial and cricketing highlight of the year. There were concerns that it could be eclipsed by the growth in popularity of Twenty20 but is still considered unique in cricket and is not expected to change.\n2012.\nIn 2012, the 161st Canterbury Cricket Week was scheduled to clash with the second week of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London leading to fears of a reduced attendance at the Cricket Week. However, Kent Chief Executive Jamie Clifford stated that he believed that it would bring in larger crowds, mainly from people who didn't have tickets to the Olympics."

Trevor Bayne, driving for Wood Brothers Racing, won the race becoming the youngest Daytona 500 winner. Carl Edwards finished second, while David Gilliland, Bobby Labonte, and Kurt Busch rounded out the Top 5. Bayne had taken the lead shortly before the final restart and maintained it to win his first Cup Series race and Wood Brothers' fifth Daytona 500.\nDuring the race there were 16 caution periods. There were 74 lead changes among 22 different drivers. Following the race, Edwards led the Drivers' Championship with 42 points, one ahead of Gilliland and Labonte. Ford led the Manufacturers' Championship with nine points, three ahead of Toyota and five ahead of Dodge. A total of 182,000 people attended the race, while 15.6 million watched it on television.\nReport.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The layout which is used for the Daytona 500 is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees. Jamie McMurray was the defending race winner.\nFor the race, NASCAR held several test sessions on January 20–22, 2011 for teams to test the newer pavement at Daytona. Also in the sessions, the opening of the restrictor plate was reduced from the plate used in tire testing to . NASCAR vice president for competition Robin Pemberton stated, \"We'll have to get back and talk to the teams and look at the speeds from the last two days of testing. I think we have some high-water marks at 197-and-a-half [miles per hour (318 km/h)] which, depending on where they pulled up in the draft, it may be a little quick, but it's hard to say.\"\nEvery test session began in the morning at 09:00 local time (), was paused for lunch from 12:00 – 13:00 local time (UTC-05:00), and concluded in the evening at 17:00 local time (UTC-05:00). During the first session on the morning of January 20, 2011, thirty-three drivers participated, and Clint Bowyer was quickest with a speed of while David Reutimann had the highest speed of during the second session in the afternoon. The third test session, scheduled for the morning of January 21, was cancelled because of wet weather. During the fourth session, held during the afternoon, 34 drivers participated with Denny Hamlin being quickest with a speed of . Several drivers decided to leave after the session, which included Reutimann, Martin Truex Jr., Jimmie Johnson, and Bowyer. During the fifth session, held on the morning of January 22, 29 drivers participated, and Joey Logano was quickest with a speed of . Brad Keselowski was quickest with a speed of in the final session.\nAfter the two-car draft style dominated the 2011 Budweiser Shootout, NASCAR reduced the front grille opening to and the overflow valve for the cooling system would be supplied by NASCAR and set at . Also, high speeds in the race caused NASCAR to reduce the size of the restrictor plate by , with the expectations of cutting 10 horsepower from the engines.\nThis race also marked the tenth anniversary of the death of seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt in 2001. As such, several tributes took place during the race. All of the cars fielded by Earnhardt's former team, Richard Childress Racing, and the team he started, Earnhardt Ganassi Racing, carried No. 3 decals. During the race itself, NASCAR held a \"silent lap\" on Lap 3, a practice that was first used in memory of Earnhardt during the 2001 season.\nEntry List.\nPractice and qualifying.\nSeven practice sessions were held before the race. The first two on February 12 ran 120 minutes and 105 minutes each. The next two on February 16 were for shortened 90 minutes and 55 minutes long after rain delays. Two days later, two more practice sessions were scheduled, which ran 60 and 85 minutes long. The final practice session was held on February 19. Mark Martin was quickest with a time of 48.681 seconds in the first session, less than one-tenth of a second faster than Jeff Gordon. Paul Menard was just off Gordon's pace, followed by Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Burton, and Bill Elliott. Johnson was seventh, still within a second of Martin's time. In the second practice session, Martin remained fastest with a time of 48.567 seconds, less than one-tenth of a second quicker than second-placed Johnson. Burton took third place, ahead of Trevor Bayne, Menard and Gordon. Also in the second practice session, McMurray collided into the wall after his tire failed, and had to move to his back-up car.\nForty-nine cars were entered for qualifying, but only 43 raced per NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Unlike most races during the season, the qualifying session only determined the first two positions, while the rest of the drivers qualified by the 2011 Gatorade Duels. Earnhardt clinched his 10th pole position during his career, with a time of 48.364 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Jeff Gordon. Once the qualifying session completed, Earnhardt commented, \"The main thing [the pole] does for me is take the pressure off Thursday's race. I can go out and have fun and not worry about where I finish or getting a good starting spot for the Daytona 500.\"\nKyle Busch was quickest in the rain-delayed third practice with 44.943 seconds, followed by Greg Biffle, Earnhardt, Johnson, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Earnhardt and Truex collided and hit the wall, both needing to use their back-up cars which meant Earnhardt forfeited pole position. Kasey Kahne led fourth practice with 44.985 seconds, only one-thousandth of a second faster than Joey Logano. Gordon was third ahead of David Ragan and Kyle Busch. Kurt Busch and Burton were the winners of the Gatorade Duels. The qualifying grid was finalized with Busch in third and Burton fourth.

Martin led the sixth session ahead of Johnson and Kahne. Brian Vickers was next with a 46.225 seconds lap ahead of Biffle with 46.426 seconds. Burton's 44.929 seconds topped the final practice session, followed by Bowyer and Keselowski. Robby Gordon and Kurt Busch rounded out the top five drivers, claiming the fourth and fifth positions respectively.\nRace.\nThe race began at 13:00 local time (), and was televised live in the United States on Fox. The conditions on the grid were dry before the race with the air temperature at . Rev. Dr. L. Ronald Durham, senior pastor of the Greater Friendship Baptist Church of Daytona Beach, Florida, began pre-race ceremonies by giving the invocation. Country music artist Martina McBride performed the national anthem, and Josh Duhamel, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and movie director Michael Bay of the upcoming film \"\", gave the command for the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, Dale Earnhardt Jr.; David Ragan, Joey Logano, and David Reutimann had to move to the rear of the grid due to changing to their back-up car. Transformers themed vehicles painted in the color schemes of Earnhardt Jr.'s, Juan Pablo Montoya's, and Jimmie Johnson's cars led the field during the pace laps as well.\nKurt Busch retained his pole position lead into the first corner, followed by outside polesitter Jeff Gordon. On the following lap, Smith began to assist Busch by drafting. On lap 3, NASCAR held a moment of silence to honor Dale Earnhardt, who died ten years ago in the 2001 race. On lap 4, A. J. Allmendinger and Mark Martin moved to the first and second positions. A lap later, the first caution was flown when Kyle Busch got turned sideways.

When the race restarted on lap 8, Kevin Harvick led but after one lap, Martin and Allmendinger passed him. Three laps later, the second caution came out when J. J. Yeley had an engine failure. Most of the drivers made pit stops under the caution, except for Brad Keselowski. At the restart, he would lead and Bobby Labonte passed him for the lead on the next lap.\nOn lap 17, Paul Menard, with assistance from Tony Stewart, took the lead from Labonte. Montoya and Jamie McMurray passed him and Stewart for the first and second positions four laps later. On lap 22, Harvick's engine failed, allowing the third caution to come out. During the caution, most of the front runners made pit stops under caution for mostly fuel, while some decided to change tires. Afterward, Clint Bowyer lead on the restart. He remained leading the next two laps, while Earnhardt Jr. moved to the 5th position. On lap 29, Reutimann and Michael Waltrip collided, causing a multi-car pileup, involving 17 drivers, including three of the four drivers from Hendrick Motorsports: Johnson, Martin, and Gordon. Some of the drivers who have led made pit stops during the caution, while McMurray and Montoya out in front as the race restarted lap 35.\nMcMurray and Montoya continued to lead for the next three laps, as 14 teams were repairing their cars in the garage after the lap 29 crash. On lap 39, Keselowski retook the lead, after having assistance from Regan Smith. Three laps later, Johnson was preparing to return to the race. On lap 43, Stewart took the lead one lap before Keselowski retook it from him. On lap 45, Bowyer became the quickest in the race with a speed of over .

On the 86th lap, Martin Truex Jr., with assistance from Carl Edwards, became the leader before Bowyer and Burton passed them on lap 87. Five laps later, Kurt Busch reclaimed the first position as Smith moved into second. On lap 94, Burton's engine failed, but no caution was given. Two laps later, Robby Gordon became the leader, after having assistance from Bayne. On the 100th lap, McMurray reclaimed the first position. On the following lap, Newman became the leader, but after four laps, Gordon passed him for the position. On lap 107, the eighth caution was given after Montoya spun following a bump from teammate McMurray. During the caution all the drivers made pit stops, with Gordon reclaiming the lead afterward. On lap 110, Kurt Busch moved to the first position, but after four laps, he was passed by Bowyer. Bowyer was passed by Truex two laps later on lap 116, but Truex Jr. himself was passed by Busch on the next lap.\nOn the 118th lap, Bowyer and Menard moved to the first two positions. By lap 120, the race had experienced 47 lead changes among 18 different leaders. Two laps later, Truex reclaimed the first position, as the ninth caution was given for Kvapil. During the caution, most of the front runners made pit stops. At the lap 127 restart, Truex led the field to the green flag, but on the following lap, Bowyer passed him. Seven laps later, the tenth caution was given after Kenseth collided with the wall. Some of the front runners made pit stops during the caution.\nOn the lap 140 restart, Bowyer was the leader, but after one lap, Truex passed him. On lap 143, the eleventh caution was given following contact between Greg Biffle and Montoya. More of the front runners made pit stops again during the caution. At the lap 146 restart, Truex was the leader. One lap later, Earnhardt Jr. claimed the lead for six laps before Newman passed him. On lap 158, a record twelfth caution was given, as Kvapil collided with the wall. Most of the drivers made pit stops during the caution, with Newman the leader. On the lap 163 restart, Newman was the leader ahead of Hamlin and Earnhardt. On the following lap, Hamlin became the leader, as Montoya moved up to third.\nOn lap 167, the thirteenth caution was caused by Keselowski colliding with the wall. The accident also involved Smith and Logano. At the lap 170 restart, Hamlin was the leader, but on the following lap he was passed by Earnhardt Jr.\nOn the next lap, Newman became the leader, as Logano drove to pit road. On the 173rd lap, Menard moved to the third position, after having assistance from Stewart. Two laps later, Ragan became the leader, but two laps later, Bowyer reclaimed the position. On lap 179, Newman moved up to the first position, as Earnhardt moved to eleventh. Three laps later, Kahne collided with the wall, prompting the caution to come out. On the same lap, McMurray had one cylinder to fail. At the lap 185 restart, Newman remained the leader. On the following lap, Earnhardt and Stewart moved into the third and fourth positions. On lap 192, Bowyer moved up to the third position, then to the first position. Three laps later, Smith moved into the first position. On lap 197, the fifteenth caution was given after Smith spun sideways, as Bowyer was also involved and sustained major damage. During the caution, Earnhardt made a pit stop because of a possible deflating tire. At the lap 202 restart, for a green-white-checker finish, Ragan was the leader, ahead of Bayne.\nOn the ensuing restart, Ragan was black flagged for changing lanes before the start / finish line just before the sixteenth caution came out after a three-car accident, involving Earnhardt Jr.; Newman; and Truex Jr. During the caution, Ragan drove to pit road, giving the lead to Trevor Bayne, with Labonte second. On the final lap of a second green-white-checker finish, Edwards and David Gilliland mounted a charge on the inside lane. Exiting turn four, Edwards drew alongside Labonte and closed in on Bayne, who moved to the bottom to block Edwards and maintained the lead to win his first race in his Sprint Cup Series career at the age of 20. Edwards finished second, ahead of Gilliland in third and Labonte in fourth. Kurt Busch clinched the fifth position; Montoya, Smith, Kyle Busch, Menard, and Martin rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.\nPost-race.\nThe 20-year-old, Bayne, appeared in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his first win of his Sprint Cup Series career, in front of a crowd of 182,000 people. Also by winning the race, he became the youngest winner of the Daytona 500 at 20 years and one day. Jeff Gordon previously held the title at 25 years old. The race was Bayne's second Sprint Cup Series start, and became the Wood Brothers Racing team's fifth Daytona 500 win. He also became the second driver to win the race in his first attempt, with the other being Lee Petty who won the 1959 Daytona 500, which was the inaugural race. With the win coming in his second start in the Sprint Cup Series, Bayne also matched Jamie McMurray for quickest victory at the start of a career; however, since Bayne was racing for the Nationwide Series points championship, he did not earn any Sprint Cup points for the win. The race victory was the Wood Brothers first win since the 2001 season. Following his win, he described his happiness, \"If I tried to put it into words, I couldn't do it any justice.\"\nFollowing the race, which experienced a record 16 cautions and 74 lead changes, among 22 different drivers, Edwards commented, \"A new winner, up-and-coming guy that's tied to so much history. This is as good as it gets. If people aren't watching, that's their problem, because we got some great stuff going on here.\" In the post-race press conference, the third-place finisher, Gilliland, said, \"It's a credit to NASCAR and their new rules, trying to get the (cars) closer, to let teams like us have a chance to be competitive. A lot of the rules (are) making these races more competitive.\" Jeff Gordon also commented about Bayne, \"I think it's very cool. Trevor's a good kid, and I love the Wood Brothers. I'm really happy for him. And I think it's great for the sport. To have a young talent like that – he's got that spark, you know?\"\nRagan, who was the leader before the fifteenth caution, described his frustration after being black flagged by saying, \"It was tough to swallow. Who knows what would have happened in that next lap? We had a top-five car [Sunday] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side – we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come down here to do.\"\nAs Bayne was running for the Nationwide Series Championship and was thus ineligible to receive points, the result left Edwards leading the Driver's Championship with 42 points. Gilliland, who finished third, was second with 41, which was tied with Bobby Labonte and was one point ahead of Kurt Busch. Montoya was fifth with 39 points. In the Manufacturers' Championship, Ford became the leader with 9 points. Toyota became second with 6 points. Dodge followed with 4 points, one point ahead of Chevrolet in fourth. 15.6 million people watched the race on television. The race took three hours, fifty-nine minutes and twenty-four seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.118 seconds."

The close-season resignation of former Joe Kinnear because of health problems (he would suffer from them again as manager of Newcastle United) after seven years as manager led to the appointment of former Norwegian national coach Egil Olsen as Wimbledon's new manager, giving Dons fans hope of beating the drop once again. The mid-season collapse of star striker John Hartson's move to Tottenham Hotspur was further good news to the cause, but a run of eight straight defeats during the final weeks of the season dragged Wimbledon into the depth of the relegation mire. Olsen was sacked after a 3–0 defeat away to Bradford City, to be replaced by former coach and assistant manager Terry Burton for the final two games of the season. A 2–2 draw at home to Aston Villa gave them hope going into their last game, away to Southampton. They were one place above the relegation zone on goal difference, but a 2–0 defeat at the Dell – combined with Bradford's 1–0 win over Liverpool – condemned Wimbledon to relegation and ended their 14-year stay in the top flight. The transition coincided with the end of one of the most remarkable rags-to-riches stories in football, which had started with Wimbledon's election to the Football League in 1977 and seen them reach the top flight nine years later, before peaking as 1988 FA Cup Final winners. Their relegation was confirmed 12 years to the day that Wimbledon achieved their famous victory over Liverpool at Wembley.\nResults.\n\"Wimbledon's score comes first\""

        "text": "On 8 July 1982, West Germany and France played in the semi-finals of the 1982 FIFA World Cup at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium in Seville, Spain. The match is known in both countries as the Night of Seville (, ). The match was won by West Germany 5–4 on penalties. They advanced to face Italy in the final. Thanks to its back-and-forth drama, four goals in extra time and a dramatic penalty shoot-out, the match is regarded as one of the best football matches of all time. It is considered by French captain Michel Platini to be his \"most beautiful game.\" West Germany's victory was the first time in the history of the World Cup that a penalty shoot-out determined the outcome.\nOverview.\nThis match, like a number of other matches at this tournament, started at nine o'clock in the evening, because July daily high temperatures in the south-western Spanish city of Seville averaged ; the hot weather during the tournament had already taken a toll on the players. The day of the match had been very hot- it had hit by 18:30 and the temperature at 21:00 was still .\nWith West Germany's captain and European Footballer of the Year Karl-Heinz Rummenigge benched from the start due to a hamstring injury, West Germany were nonetheless the first to score, in the 17th minute. With Klaus Fischer charging in to challenge the French goalkeeper Jean-Luc Ettori from about 12 yards out, the ball rebounded to Pierre Littbarski, who scored with a first-time shot from 18 yards.\nAfter 27 minutes, Bernd Förster was penalised for holding Dominique Rocheteau and France were awarded a penalty, which was converted by Platini.\nDespite several good chances for both sides, including Manuel Amoros hitting the crossbar in stoppage time, the score remained at 1–1 at full time. The teams then played two 15-minute periods of extra time. In the second minute of the first period, Marius Tresor struck an 11-yard volley after a deflected free kick from just outside the box to put France ahead for the first time in the match, 2–1. Rummenigge entered the game shortly afterwards in place of Hans-Peter Briegel, but it was France who struck once again at the 98 minute mark, with Alain Giresse firing a first-time shot from 18 yards off Harald Schumacher's right post and into the goal to give France a 3–1 advantage.\nFour minutes later, West Germany began their comeback, with Rummenigge flicking home an outside-of-the-foot volley from six yards that cut France's lead in half. Three minutes into the second extra time period, Fischer scored with a bicycle kick from six yards, and the teams were level once more at 3–3, where the score remained until the end of extra time.\nThe penalty shootout began with Giresse converting the first kick for France, which was answered by West Germany's Manfred Kaltz. Amoros for France and Paul Breitner for West Germany both converted, but in the third round, Uli Stielike's shot was blocked by Ettori, following Rocheteau's successful strike, giving France a 3–2 lead. However, in the fourth round, France failed to capitalise: Schumacher blocked Didier Six's shot, and Littbarski scored for West Germany. Platini and Rummenigge both scored in the fifth round, and the shootout, tied at 4–4, moved to sudden-death. In the sixth round, Maxime Bossis's shot was blocked, and Horst Hrubesch converted to give West Germany the win.\nControversy.\nIn the second half, the West German goalkeeper Schumacher collided with the French player Patrick Battiston, which knocked Battiston unconscious and forced him from the game with two missing teeth, three cracked ribs, and damaged vertebrae, though no foul was given. France were forced to use their second substitution to replace Battiston, who himself had come on only ten minutes earlier. By contrast, West Germany were able to use their own second substitution to bring on Rummenigge in extra time, and he scored five minutes after taking the field."

        "title": "Old Buckenham Hall Cricket Ground",
        "text": "Old Buckenham Hall is a cricket ground in Old Buckenham, near Attleborough in Norfolk. The ground was initially established in the early 20th century and was used for six first-class matches by its owner, Australian Lionel Robinson. The ground later became part of a school and was reestablished as a cricket ground in the 1960s. It has since been used by the Norfolk Women cricket team for fixtures.\nHistory.\nThe estate at Old Buckenham Hall was purchased by the Australian financier Lionel Robinson in 1906 from Frederick Duleep Singh. Robinson expanded the estate from 340 to 2000 acres and within the space of four years built two separate cricket grounds, each equipped with a thatched timber pavilion. The first ground was half a mile from the Hall and adjacent to Old Buckenham Stud, which Robinson established to further his involvement in horse racing. The second – the current ground – was created in a woodland clearing close to the rebuilt Hall, Robinson having replaced Duleep Singh’s Georgian house with a vast neo-Jacobean mansion. \nHis personal cricket team played the first of several first-class cricket matches at the ground against the touring South Africans in 1912. Before the First World War, three further first-class matches were held there with L. G. Robinson's XI playing Cambridge University and J. R. Mason's XI in 1913, and Oxford University in 1914. In 1919, Robinson hosted the Australian Imperial Forces, a team formed of Australian servicemen who were facing a prolonged delay to their demobilisation. The AIF team had been selected from around 100 Australian servicemen who had turned up for trials at Lord's and The Oval; the match was twelve-a-side. \nIn early May 1921, a final first-class match was held at the ground between L. G. Robinson's XI and the touring Australians. Robinson’s team was captained by his cricket manager, the former England captain Archie MacLaren, and included Jack Hobbs, Percy Chapman and Johnny Douglas. Australia were led by Warwick Armstrong and included Jack Gregory – who had made his first-class debut with the AIF team at Old Buckenham two years previously – Warren Bardsley and Charlie Macartney. The three-day match was rain-affected and ended in a draw. Hobbs top-scored with 85, an effort he later nominated as possibly his finest ever innings. A crowd of up to 10,000 watched Hobbs bat on the second day, believed to be the largest ever to attend a cricket match in Norfolk. \nSchool years and fire.\nFollowing Robinson’s death in July 1922, the Hall and estate were sold and came into the possession of Ernest Gates who continued to stage cricket at the ground until putting the property up for sale in 1932. Four years later, Old Buckenham Hall School was established there and the cricket ground formed part of the school’s sporting facilities. The Hall, however, was destroyed by fire in December 1952, only an annexed building (now a private residence still bearing the name Old Buckenham Hall) surviving the blaze. The school moved to alternative premises, eventually becoming established at Brettenham, although retaining the name Old Buckenham Hall School. The thatched cricket pavilion at Old Buckenham was also dismantled and moved to the school's playing fields at Brettenham where it still stands.\nRestoration.\nAfter the school’s departure, the Old Buckenham Hall cricket ground fell into disuse until it was restored in the early 1960s by members of Old Buckenham Cricket Club at the invitation of the then landowners, Oliver and Greeba Sear. Prior to that, the club had played on the village green. In 1982 the club bought the ground and six years later erected a brick pavilion and scorers’ box. The ground remains the home of Old Buckenham Cricket Club. It is now named The Horry Panks Cricket Ground in honour of a long-serving player and groundsman whose family was instrumental in its 1960s revival.\nFirst-class records.\nA total of six first-class matches were played on the ground between 1912 and 1921, all of them featuring LG Robinson's XI as the home side. In 2019 the Norfolk Women cricket team played a single List A match on the ground. The side played all four of its home Twenty20 fixtures on the ground, having intended to use the ground during the 2020 season which was cancelled by the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "text": "Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1880 was the tenth season of the English cricket club Derbyshire.\nDerbyshire played Lancashire and Yorkshire, whom they had played in the previous season. However, instead of Hampshire and Nottinghamshire, they played against Sussex for the first time and Kent, whom they had played in a previous season.\n1880 season.\nDerbyshire played eight county games in 1880, two each against Lancashire, Kent, Sussex and Yorkshire. They also played a first-class match against MCC and a match against the touring Australians. Derbyshire won one match against Kent and one against Sussex.\nRobert Smith was in his fifth year as captain. Sydney Evershed of the brewing family and Edmund Maynard an Old Harrovian, both future captains, made their debuts for the club in 1880. George Barrington an Old Reptonian, and James Stubbings, a stonemason, went on to play occasionally for several more seasons. Stephen Doughty, a miner, joined to play in 1880 and 1886 and William Antliff, a railway clerk, played two first-class games for Derbyshire in the 1880 season.\nDerbyshire's long standing wicket-keeper since 1873, Alfort Smith, played his last season in 1880, but maintained contact with the game by umpiring. George Frost who had played his first season in 1872 also played his last season. Frederick Keeton had joined Derbyshire in 1876 and played his last first-class match, although he did re-appear for the club in 1888 when their matches were not first class. AW Cursham played his second and last season as a cricketer for Derbyshire but continued his football career until he emigrated to the United States three years later.\nDerbyshire opened the season with a match against the touring Australians. The Australians opened with 129 and Derbyshire managed 45 in reply and followed on to make 125. The Australians made 42, to win by eight wickets before the end of the second day. Derbyshire lost 13 wickets for 85 runs to Fred Spofforth who ten years later was Derbyshire's captain. With a day spare, the teams played a fill up one-innings match in which Derbyshire made 119, but Australia did not have a chance to bat. In the Lancashire match, Lancashire made 204 in their first innings and Derbyshire made 246 in reply. Lancashire replicated their score with 204 in the second innings. Derbyshire lost two players run out chasing Lancashire's total and ended 21 runs behind on 141. Against MCC, Derbyshire managed a first innings total of 26 in reply to MCC's 201 and made 74 in to follow-on to give MCC a victory of an innings and 191 runs. Fred Morley took 11 Derbyshire wickets at a cost of 43 runs. In the match against Kent, Kent made 102 in the first innings and Derbyshire responded with 99. Kent made 96 in their second innings and Derbyshire reached the necessary 96 for the loss of 4 wickets to achieve a six wicket victory.

Lancashire's second innings total was 123 and Derbyshire were all out for 72 by the end of the second day to give Lancashire a win by 65 runs. In the second match against Yorkshire, Yorkshire opened with 226 and Derbyshire had made 72 for three by the end of the first day.

        "text": "Kevin E. Lowe is a finance executive and retired professional lacrosse player who played professional box lacrosse in the National Lacrosse League and professional field lacrosse in Major League Lacrosse from 1995 to 2006. He starred as a member of the Princeton Tigers men's lacrosse team from 1991 through 1994 and was inducted into the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame in 2009, joining his brother and father. He was a high school and college lacrosse United States Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association (USILA) All-American. Lowe has the distinction of being the only player in lacrosse history to score an overtime goal in an NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship game and a Major League Lacrosse Steinfeld Cup championship game. He holds numerous Princeton scoring records and formerly held the Ivy League single-season assists record. As a college senior, he was honored as the National Collegiate Athletic Association's best lacrosse attackman and the Ivy League's best player. In his four-year college career, Princeton won its first two NCAA tournament Championship, two Ivy League Championships and earned four NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship tournament invitations.\nBackground.\nHe is the brother of 1992 Division I Player of the Year and Hall of Famer Darren Lowe and son of Hall of Famer Alan Lowe. Alan, who was the longtime Manhasset High School coach, had won both a World Lacrosse Championship and NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship. Lowe was a high school All-American from Mineola, New York who received numerous prep accolades: National High School North/South Lacrosse All-Star Game (1990), Nassau County All-Star Game (1990) and Empire State Games (1989). Lowe is currently married with three children. As a youth he played soccer, the quarterback position in American football and the point guard position in basketball. He is currently a stockbroker on Wall Street.\nCollege career.\nIncluding the 2009 season, Lowe holds the 5th highest career total in NCAA Division I with 174 assists. Lowe holds numerous Princeton University scoring records (career points, career assists, single-game assists, consecutive games with a point, and points by a freshman). He formerly held the school records for single-season points and single-season assists. Lowe formerly held the Ivy League career assists record. However, since the Ivy League uses conference games only, Ryan Boyle now holds the career assists record although Lowe holds the school record. Lowe is the only Tiger to have scored a point in all of Princeton's games during his career (Boyle scored in all games he played but missed 4 games). His final career goal clinched the 1994 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship for the Tigers in overtime. Princeton was 52–8 during Lowe's career, including a 7–2 record in four NCAA tournaments. The 1992 and 1993 teams were undefeated 6–0 outright Ivy League champions,\nAs a freshman, on April 6, 1991, he led number three ranked Princeton to a 17–9 victory over Yale. It was Princeton's first victory over Yale since 1986. Lowe had nine assists, which set a school single-game record. As of 2010, this continues to be a Princeton single-game record. After the tenth game of the season, Lowe continued to lead the nation in assists. He was the leading scorer on Princeton's team that won the 1992 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship to win its first NCAA tournament. As a senior in 1994, his 73 assists in league games broke his brother Darren's 1992 Ivy League single season record and earned him Ivy League Player of the Year honors. In the 1994 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championship game, he scored the game-winning goal in sudden death overtime against Virginia. After Princeton won the face-off, the goal came on the first shot on goal of overtime. When his collegiate eligibility ended, he had the four highest single-season assist totals in school history.\nLowe was the Jack Turnbull Award and Men's Ivy League Player of the Year Award winner for 1994. He was a first team USILA All-American Team selection in 1994 and a second team selection in 1992 and 1993. He was a four-time All-Ivy League selection and three-time first team All-Ivy League selection (1992, 1993, &amp; 1994)\nClub Lacrosse Career.\nBoth Kevin Lowe and Darren Lowe played post-collegiate lacrosse for the famed Long Island-Hofstra lacrosse club. The Lowe brothers were well known for their “high IQ” patient offensive style. Both brothers played for the Long Island-Hofstra lacrosse club in the storied 1996 USCLA Championship (held at Cabrini College) victory over the highly favored Team Toyota which featured Quint Kessenich, Gary Gait, and Paul Gait.\nProfessional career.\nLowe played in the indoor National Lacrosse League from 1995 to 2001 and the outdoor Major League Lacrosse from 2003 to 2006. He played with the New York Saints of the NLL in 1995, 1996, 2000 and 2001. Then he played in the MLL with the Long Island Lizards in 2003 and 2004 and the Philadelphia Barrage in 2006. In 2003, he was selected to his first MLL All-Star Game, he was injured and instead served as an assistant coach during the game.

        "title": "1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team",
        "text": "The 1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team, nicknamed the \"Dream Team\", was the first American Olympic team to feature active professional players from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The team has often been described as the greatest sports team ever assembled.\nAt the 1992 Summer Olympics held in Barcelona, the team defeated its opponents by an average of 44 points en route to the gold medal against Croatia.\nThe team was collectively inducted into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame in 2009, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010, and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017. The Naismith Hall of Fame calls the team \"the greatest collection of basketball talent on the planet\". In addition to the team induction, 11 players and three coaches have also been inducted individually into the Naismith Hall of Fame.\nForming the team.\nBackground.\nPrior to the 1992 Olympics, FIBA rules specifically prevented NBA players from participating in Olympic tournaments, and only amateurs were eligible for the U.S. Olympic teams, which were composed of collegiate and, at times (especially in the 1950s), AAU players. Other countries used their best players from their domestic professional leagues. In the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Americans lost to the USSR and settled for bronze, their worst finish in the history of the tournament. \nOn 7 April 1989, at a special congress in Munich following the 1988–89 FIBA European Champions Cup finals, FIBA delegates voted, by a margin of 56 to 13, to allow professional basketball players to participate in its international events, including the World Cup and the Olympics. The decision led to professional players, particularly those from the United States' National Basketball Association, dominating the sport at the highest levels of international competition. The change also warded off competition from the Goodwill Games, the biggest rival of the Olympics at the time, which was seeking to bring professional players into its basketball events. The Amateur Basketball Association of the United States of America (ABAUSA, renamed USA Basketball after the vote) voted against it due to \"colleges and high schools that make up most of [ABAUSA's] constituency [opposing] it.\" The Soviet proposal to limit the national teams to only two NBA players for the first few years was then unanimously rejected.\nSelections.\nUSA Basketball asked the NBA to supply players for its 1992 roster; the league was initially unenthusiastic about this idea. In early 1991, \"Sports Illustrated\" labeled the forthcoming American roster as the \"Dream Team\" on the cover of its February 18 issue.\nThe first ten players for the team were selected on September 21, 1991: Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen of the Chicago Bulls, John Stockton and Karl Malone of the Utah Jazz, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers, Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics, Patrick Ewing of the New York Knicks, Chris Mullin of the Golden State Warriors, David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs, and Charles Barkley of the Philadelphia 76ers. On May 12, 1992, Clyde Drexler of the Portland Trail Blazers was chosen over Isiah Thomas of the Detroit Pistons for the final professional roster spot. As an acknowledgment to the previous amateur system, the U.S. basketball committee decided to include one collegiate player on the team: Christian Laettner of Duke University was added on May 12, 1992, chosen over Louisiana State University's Shaquille O'Neal.\nMost of the players on the team were at or near the peaks of their NBA careers. Bird had back trouble but was selected due to the team's historic nature. Robinson had played with the 1988 Olympic team and was eager to earn a gold medal at Barcelona.\nJohnson had retired from the Lakers in November 1991 after testing positive for HIV. His teammates expected Johnson to die from the disease, and he later described his selection for the Olympics as \"almost like a life saver\", evidence that he could still overcome the illness and live a productive life. The Australian Olympic delegation prominently threatened to boycott the games in protest of Johnson's presence, fearing that he might infect other athletes. Their threats backfired, however, as Johnson received even more public support. Ewing, Jordan, and Mullin had won gold at the 1984 games; Malone had not made the team and saw his non-selection in 1984 as a challenge.\nJordan declined head coach Chuck Daly's suggestion that Jordan serve as the public face of the team, and Bird and Johnson were selected as co-captains. Over the previous 13 NBA seasons leading up to the 1992 Olympics, these three superstars combined had won 10 NBA championships and received seven NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards and nine regular-season MVP awards.\nIsiah Thomas left off team.\nThere was speculation that Isiah Thomas was not part of the team because Jordan would participate only if Thomas was not on the roster. At the time, it was widely believed that Jordan did not like Thomas because he was seen as the \"ring leader\" of the Detroit Pistons of the late 1980s and early 1990s; nicknamed the \"\", the team employed overtly physical tactics against Jordan in the NBA Playoffs. In his 2012 book \"Dream Team\", author Jack McCallum quotes Jordan as saying to Team USA selection committee member Rod Thorn, \"Rod, I don't want to play if Isiah Thomas is on the team\". In 2020, Thorn and Jordan denied directly mentioning Thomas's name in discussions. According to Jordan in the documentary series \"The Last Dance\", he asked Thorn, \"Who’s all playing?\" to which Thorn responded, \"The guy you're thinking about is not going to be playing.\"\nAfter the selection of the first ten members of the team, Johnson released an official statement in support of Thomas, but years later it was discovered that his support was less than enthusiastic. In the book \"When the Game Was Ours\", Johnson said, \"Isiah killed his own chances when it came to the Olympics. Nobody on that team wanted to play with him.\"\nLaettner selection over O'Neal.\nThe selection committee considered several college players including Harold Miner, Jimmy Jackson, and Alonzo Mourning in addition to Shaquille O'Neal and Christian Laettner. O'Neal was the number-one pick in the 1992 NBA draft, but Laettner's Duke Blue Devils teams won consecutive National Championships in 1991 and 1992. Coached by Mike Krzyzewski, who also was a first-time assistant coach for the Olympic program, Laettner was the Naismith College Player of the Year and scored the game-winning basket as time expired in the 1992 NCAA Eastern Regional final. Although O'Neal was a two-time Consensus NCAA First Team All-American in 1991 and 1992, his team lost in the second round of the 1992 NCAA men's tournament. Laettner's college success and coach's endorsement ultimately secured his position on the team.\nSuccess on the court.\nEarly scrimmages.\nTo help the team prepare for the Olympics, a squad of the best NCAA college players was formed to scrimmage them. USA Basketball selected players whose style of play, it hoped, would resemble that of the Europeans the Dream Team would face. Members included the penetrating guard Bobby Hurley, all-around players Grant Hill and Penny Hardaway, outside shooter Allan Houston, and the tough Chris Webber and Eric Montross. Hill and Hardaway would play for the 1996 national team, and Houston on the 2000 team.\nIn late June, the Dream Team first met together in La Jolla, California, astounding and intimidating the collegians who watched them practice. However, on June 24, the Dream Team lost to the NCAA team, 62–54, after underestimating the opposition. Daly intentionally limited Jordan's playing time and made non-optimal substitutions; assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski later said that the head coach \"threw the game\" to teach the NBA players that they could be beaten. The teams played again the following day, with the Olympians winning decisively in the rematch. Some of the college players visited Jordan's hotel room afterward and asked their hero for his personal items as souvenirs.\nTournament of the Americas.\nThe Dream Team made its international debut on June 28 at the Tournament of the Americas, an Olympic qualifying event in Portland, Oregon. The team defeated Cuba 136–57, prompting Cuban coach Miguel Calderón Gómez to say, \"You can't cover the sun with your finger.\" Marv Albert, who announced the game, recalled that \"it was as if [the Americans] were playing a high school team, or grade school team. They were so overwhelming ... a blowout after blowout.\" The Cubans were the first of many opponents who were more interested in taking photos with the Americans than playing them. The next five games were also easy victories for Team USA, which ended the tournament on July 5 with a 127–80 victory over Venezuela in the championship game to win the tournament and be one of four Americas squads to qualify for the Olympics.\nOlympics.\nThe team trained for the Olympics in Monaco for six days, practicing two hours a day and playing exhibition games against other national teams. During their time away from the court, the squad spent time enjoying the nude beaches, Monte Carlo's casinos, and dining with royalty. There was no curfew; as Daly stated, \"I'm not putting in a curfew because I'd have to adhere to it, and Jimmy'z [a noted Monte Carlo nightclub] doesn't open until midnight.\"\nFor one scrimmage, the group divided into two teams: Blue (led by Johnson, with Barkley, Robinson, Mullin, and Laettner) and White (led by Jordan, with Malone, Ewing, Pippen, and Bird). Drexler and Stockton did not play because of injuries. Daly told the teams to play \"All you got now. All you got.\" White won, 40 to 36, in what Jordan recalled as \"the best game I was ever in\" and \"Sports Illustrated\" later called \"the Greatest Game Nobody Ever Saw\".\nBecause of the team's unique celebrity, the Dream Team did not stay in the Olympic Village due to security concerns. The Olympic Village had only four guards at the gate when the team arrived to pick up their credentials; one of the guards, upon seeing the Dream Team, grabbed his camera and his child while the team members were mobbed by other Olympic athletes. Daly also stated that the beds in the Village were a problem, as two of his athletes were over seven feet tall and he considered comfort a priority to keep the team rested.\nAs a result, the team stayed at Barcelona's Hotel Ambassador, where USA Basketball occupied 80 of the hotel's 98 rooms. Fans were not allowed to enter the lobby, but did gather outside the hotel, hoping to see their favorite players. \"It was like Elvis and the Beatles put together,\" Daly said. Opposing basketball players and athletes from other sports often asked to have photographs taken with the players.\nIn an interview years later, Charles Barkley recounted that \"we got death threats\". Despite that assertion, Barkley walked around the city alone. When asked where his bodyguards were, he held up his fists and answered, \"This is my security.\"\nJordan was the only player who studied the opposition, carefully watching game tapes. He and the other Americans enjoyed the opportunity to get to know each other in a casual setting, often playing cards all night and, for Jordan, playing several rounds of golf daily with little rest.\nOpposing teams were nonetheless overwhelmed by the talent of the American roster, losing by an average of 43.8 points per game. This was the second largest Olympic Games point differential, surpassed only by the 53.5 point per game margin achieved by the 1956 US Men's Basketball Team. The Dream Team was the first to score more than 100 points in every game. Its 117.3 average was over 15 points more than the 1960 US team. Johnson later recalled, \"I look to my right, there's Michael Jordan ... I look to my left, there's Charles Barkley or Larry Bird ... I didn't know who to throw the ball to!\"\nIn a press conference before the team's first Olympic game against Angola, Barkley famously quipped \"I don't know anything about Angola. But Angola's in trouble.\" Herlander Coimbra of Angola recalled that \"those guys were on another level—a galaxy far, far away\". During the game, Barkley elbowed Coimbra in the chest and was unapologetic after the game, claiming he was hit first. Barkley was called for an intentional foul on the play. Coimbra's resulting free throw was the only point scored by Angola during a 46–1 run by the US.\nAlthough this incident had no bearing on the final result (a 116–48 USA win), at the time there was a concern about the image of America to the rest of the world. After the game, Jordan said, \"There just wasn't any place for it. We were dominating the game. It created mixed feelings, it caused a mixed reaction about the U.S. There's already some negative feelings about us.\" Even though this was the only incident of the game, it changed the narrative; instead of the Americans being viewed as a highly skilled team beating an underdog, some viewed them as bullies.\nDaly started Jordan in every game, and Johnson started in five of the six games he played, missing two games because of knee problems. Pippen, Bird, Mullin, Robinson, Ewing, Malone, and Barkley rotated in the other starting spots. Barkley was the Dream Team's leading scorer during the Olympics, averaging 18.0 points per game, although the player selection committee had been unsure of his inclusion, worried that he would not represent the United States well.\nThe closest of the eight matches was Team USA's 117–85 victory over Croatia in the gold medal game. Croatia, participating as an independent nation in the Olympics for the first time since its separation from the former Yugoslavia, briefly led the Dream Team by a score of 25–23 in the first half. By the end of the game, Team USA had pulled away and Stockton agreed to a Croatian player's plea not to shoot. Pippen and Jordan aggressively sought the opportunity to guard Toni Kukoč of Croatia. He had just signed a contract with the Bulls for more money than Pippen, who believed that the team's negotiation with the Croatian had delayed his own contract. Tired of hearing about Kukoč's talent, Pippen and Jordan agreed to, as Jordan later said, \"not ... let this guy do \"anything\" against us.\" McCallum described the two Bulls as \"rabid dogs\" against Kukoč. Croatia had lost to the Dream Team 103–70 in their first game. The only team besides Croatia to hold the margin under 40 points was Puerto Rico, which lost 115–77 in the quarterfinals.\nLegacy.\n\"Sports Illustrated\" later stated that the Dream Team was \"arguably the most dominant squad ever assembled in any sport\" and compared it to \"Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison, the Allman Brothers at the Fillmore East, Santana at Woodstock.\" In 2009, the team was elected to the U.S. Olympic &amp; Paralympic Hall of Fame. The following year, the team was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nBarkley later said, \"I don't think there's anything better to representing your country. I don't think anything in my life can come close to that.\" Bird called the medal ceremony and the playing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" \"the ultimate experience.\" Johnson said, \"The 92 Dream Team was the greatest moment of my life in terms of basketball, bar none.\" Jordan said that the biggest benefit for him from the Olympics was that he learned more about his teammates' weaknesses. He later defeated Barkley, Malone, and Stockton in three NBA finals. As of 2014, 11 of the 12 players on the roster (all except Laettner) and three of the four coaches (all except Carlesimo) have been elected to the Hall of Fame as individuals.\nGlobal interest in basketball soared due to the Dream Team. In one game, an opposing player guarding Magic Johnson was seen frantically waving to a camera-wielding teammate on the bench, signaling to make sure he got a picture of them together. Daly said of the opposing teams \"They'll go home and for the rest of their lives be able to tell their kids, 'I played against Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson and Larry Bird.' And the more they play against our best players, the more confident they're going to get\".\nInternational Olympic Committee head Juan Antonio Samaranch stated that \"the most important aspect of the [Barcelona] Games has been the resounding success of the basketball tournament, as we've witnessed the best basketball in the world.\" Subsequently, the number of international players in the NBA rose. On opening day of the 1991–92 season, NBA rosters included 23 international players from 18 countries. At the start of the 2011–12 season, there were 74 players from 35 countries. Many international players credited the Dream Team as their inspiration to take up basketball.\nKobe Bryant and LeBron James said they believed their 2012 Olympic team would win against the Dream Team. Bryant said, \"[T]hey were a lot older, at kind of the end of their careers. We have just a bunch of young racehorses, guys that are eager to compete.\" Barkley said that he \"just started laughing\" upon hearing Bryant's comment and that the Dream Team would win by double digits. Jordan added, \"For [Bryant] to compare those two teams is not one of the smarter things he ever could have done... Remember now, they learned from us. We didn't learn from them.\" Bird joked, \"They probably could. I haven't played in 20 years and we're all old now.\"\nThe team was elected to the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2017.\nTournament of the Americas results.\nThe team was undefeated, with their closest margin of victory being 38 points over Puerto Rico.\nOlympics results.\nThe team was again undefeated, with their closest outing being the 32-point victory over Croatia for the gold medal."

        "text": "The Singer World Series was a quadrangular ODI cricket tournament held in Sri Lanka from 26 August to 7 September 1996. It featured the national cricket teams of Zimbabwe, Australia, India and the hosts, Sri Lanka. The competition was won by Sri Lanka, which defeated Australia in the final.\nBackground.\nThe Singer World Series was the first senior cricket tournament to be held in Sri Lanka after the 1996 Cricket World Cup. Security threats due to the Sri Lankan Civil War and potential terrorist attacks from the LTTE had led Australia to refuse to visit Sri Lanka for their scheduled match in the island nation. This time, Australia agreed to participate amidst intensive security arrangements. Following their 1996 World Cup triumph, Sri Lanka had emerged as clear favourites. The Australian team was considered the most serious challenger to their prospects. Zimbabwe's struggling, lacklustre performances did not make them serious contenders. The Indian team had come off a string of successive ODI tournament defeats and a poor showing in their tour of England, which led to the replacement of the team captain Mohammad Azharuddin with his deputy, Sachin Tendulkar. The Singer World Series was to be Tendulkar's first ODI tournament leading the national team.\nSquads.\nAll three visiting sides had new captains, while Sri Lanka largely retained the team that had won the World Cup under veteran Arjuna Ranatunga's captaincy. Their 14-player squad was largely unchanged from the one that had claimed the World Cup. India had named a 14-player squad under the leadership of Sachin Tendulkar. It featured two debutants: fast-bowler David Johnson and off-spin bowler Sunil Joshi. The squad was being coached by retired Indian pace bowler Madan Lal. Owing to Mark Taylor's back injury, wicket-keeper Ian Healy took over as captain of Australia's 13-player squad for the series, which included the debutants fast-bowler Jason Gillespie, spin bowler Brad Hogg and batsman Darren Lehmann. Zimbabwe's 16-player squad was led by their new captain, Alistair Campbell, who had succeeded Andy Flower.\nPoints table.\nThe tournament was organised in a round robin format, with each team playing each other once.\nRecords and awards.\nSri Lanka's vice-captain Aravinda de Silva won the player of the series award for amassing 334 runs in just 4 innings without losing his wicket, remaining unbeaten in all of them. Sri Lankan spin bowler Upul Chandana and Australian fast-bowler Glenn McGrath both took 7 wickets, but Chandana did so in only 3 matches to McGrath's 4."

        "text": "Skeleton Creek is a 2009 children's horror mystery novel by Patrick Carman, the first of a continuing series. The second is \"Ghost in the Machine\" (published in 2009), the third is \"The Crossbones\" (published in 2010), the fourth is \"The Raven\" (published in 2011), and the fifth is \"The Phantom Room\" (published in 2014).\nSynopsis.\nThe story takes place in a small town called Skeleton Creek, that was formerly a gold and silver mining town. It is haunted by the ghost of \"Old Joe Bush\", a man who died in an accident on The Dredge, a large mining machine. Two youths in the town, Ryan McCray and Sarah Fincher, attempt to investigate the dredge and its ghost, while being closely watched by their parents and Ranger Bonner who are trying to keep the two separated after Ryan breaks his leg on the Dredge which leads to Sarah and Ryan not being able to communicate with each other at all. A video series, starring Sarah, also goes along with the novel, which shows trips to the Dredge and ghost sightings such as Old Joe Bush\nPre-release.\nPrior to the release of \"Skeleton Creek\", a conspiracy website (SkeletonCreekIsReal.com) was created, questioning whether the videos and journal entries were actual events. The basis of the website is that the creator found a hidden directory on Patrick Carman's website. On the directory were files of videos. The creator uses these videos to determine that the events in Skeleton Creek happened in the real town of Sumpter, Oregon. The site has a blog where the creator talks about findings, and videos where he posts things such as the videos he finds on Patrick Carman's website, analysis of those videos, a trip to the Dredge and promotion for \"The Raven\", the fourth book in the series. As of August 13, 2011, no blog entries have been made, and the last video was posted November 1, 2010. Even though it is considered abandoned, updates to the site are made, such as new advertisements for Patrick Carman's other projects. Patrick Carman has admitted to creating the website to promote the book and its sequels. One of these websites is called Sarahfincher.com. It accompanies the book. It is filled with videos that may be spooky for young children. To watch a video you must have reached a point in the book that has a password. Many of the password contains gibberish making the passwords hard to guess. The videos are made, looking like they are only made for Ryan, and many people enjoy playing along."

        "text": "The 2010 Commonwealth Games Village was the athletes' residence for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, India. The village is spread over an area of .\nFacilities.\nResidential zone.\nThe Village had 14 apartament blocks, 34 towers and 1,168 air-conditioned apartaments built by the indian arm of the Emaar.The village was divided into four zones:\nIt also included the CGA office spaces, the Polyclinic and the Casual Dining Space.\nAfter the games, Emaar had the rights to sell 66% of the luxury apartments, which will be sold for Rs 18–42 million each (U$387,000-U$903,000)\nInternational zone.\nThe International Zone included the common areas with the Guest Pass Centre, the VIP Waiting Area, the Chefs de Mission Meeting Hall, the Mayor's Office, and the Media Center.\nTraining area.\nBeside the common areas,had training areas for Athletics, Aquatics, Weightlifting/Para-sport Powerlifting and Wrestling. There is an eight-lane 400 m Synthetic athletics track and an Olympic-size swimming pool. It also has gymnasium and fitness centre, steam and sauna facilities, physiotherapy rooms.\nDining.\nThe Dining area has the capacity to accommodate 2,300 of the total residents. During the Games, the main dining service was opened 24 hours and provided free meal service.\nOperational zone.\nOperational Zone I was located adjacent to the Training Area, while Operational Zone II was adjacent to the Residential Zone.\nTransportation.\nTwo free transport systems in the Games Village were used – the Internal Village Shuttle and the Bus Service. Customised cart and golf carts was also be available for Internal movement.\nFeatures.\nSince 2011,the Village is occupied by individual private home-owners. A picturesque site has been selected on the banks of river Yamuna for the purpose of construction of the games village. The project site was within the immediate vicinity of monuments and historical landmarks, combined with dense green natural covers on the sides.\nSite and landscape.\nDuring the Games near 4000 bedrooms spread across 34 towers varying in heights (such as; 7 to 9 storeys high). The proposed apartment's blocks were arranged in site in a way so as to create visual links with heritage sites in the vicinity. The topsoil of the entire excavated site has been collected and stored separately and special measures have been taken for soil stabilisation, such as- stockpiling, mulching, and so on. Pervious paving has been provided extensively in the site. All the service lines and utility corridors on the site are well aggregated and ensure minimum disruption during future maintenance work.\nHealth and well-being.\nThe sanitation/safety facilities for the construction workers are provided as per National Building Code 2005. These include provision of clean and hygienic accommodation, toilet facilities, purified drinking water, general store, a subsidised canteen, medical facilities, day care centre and onsite safety equipment, and so on. Significant measures have been taken to reduce air pollution during construction, such as – site roads are regularly sprayed with water; wheels of all vehicles are washed, and so on.\nWater.\nWater efficient landscaping is being practised to minimise post construction water usage. This is being done by providing native species, efficient irrigation systems and by limiting lawn areas. The building water consumption also has been reduced by use of high efficiency low-flow fixtures. The construction water management on site is very efficient in terms of reuse of waste water and less utilisation of potable water in construction.\nBuilding design and energy.\nThe building design has also included the existing site features, such as, the visual linkages with historical monuments, solar geometry, and so on. Due to high density planning requirements, the design did not permit optimum orientation for all apartment blocks. As a result, the apartment blocks have equal exposure towards all cardinal directions. However, the critical facades are shaded and have high performance glazing to negate impact of direct incident radiation. The buildings are fully compliant with the Energy Conservation Building Code 2007. Several energy efficiency measures such as roof insulation, high performance glazing, energy efficient lighting and variable refrigerant volume (VRV) based air conditioning system have been provided to reduce the energy consumption of the apartments significantly.\nRenewable energy.\nSolar photo voltaic system is proposed to meet the 10% of total energy requirements for internal lighting. 31% of outdoor lighting is provided through solar energy. Solar hot water systems are provided to meet part of water heating needs.\nOther features.\nWaste water recycling and solid waste management for the entire campus were planned by the Delhi Jal Board at a macro level for the village as well as adjoining.\nLocation.\nThe games village is located near Akshardham Temple and Pandav Nagar in New Delhi on the banks of the River Yamuna.\nControversies.\nWeeks before the opening ceremony Sir Michael Fennell, President of the Commonwealth Games Federation, wrote to the Indian cabinet secretary urging action in response to the village being \"seriously compromised.\" He said that though team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were \"shocked\" by the state of the accommodation. \"The village is the cornerstone of any Games and the athletes deserve the best possible environment to prepare for their competition.\"\nFour National Associations:New Zealand, Scotland, Canada and Northern Ireland demanded that their teams to stay hotels if their accommodation is not ready. The England and Wales teams arrived to Delhi on 23 September 2010, following satisfactory progress of improvement works at the village. The Scotland Team arrived on 25 September 2010."

        "text": "The 1956–57 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team was a Division I college basketball team that represented the University of Kansas. Coached by Dick Harp, the Jayhawks posted a 24–3 win–loss record, winning the then-Big Seven Conference and qualifying for the 1957 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. Kansas won three games in the NCAA tournament to reach the championship game, where the Jayhawks lost to North Carolina in triple overtime.\nSeason summary.\nDick Harp was named the head coach of the Jayhawks before the 1956–57 season. The previous coach, Phog Allen, had been forced to leave the program due to an enforced retirement age in place at the school. The 1956–57 Jayhawks featured future National Basketball Association center Wilt Chamberlain, in his first season with the varsity program. Expectations for the team were high entering the season; Allen said of the Jayhawks' new player that \"Anybody could win the national championship with Wilt Chamberlain and four cheerleaders.\" Chamberlain averaged 29.6 points and 18.8 rebounds per game over the course of the season. In Kansas' opening game against Northwestern, he scored 52 points and compiled 31 rebounds in an 87–69 win. The Jayhawks won their next five games by at least 10 points each, and began the season with 12 consecutive victories. Following that streak, Iowa State defeated Kansas 39–37. Kansas lost one other game in the regular season, on February 20, 1957, against Oklahoma by a score of 56–54. The Jayhawks wrapped up the Big Seven title, and an NCAA Tournament berth, with a 64–57 win over Kansas State on March 7. They ended the regular season with a record of 20–2, and a Big Seven record of 11–1.\nIn the first round of the NCAA tournament, Kansas faced SMU and was forced into an overtime period. Behind 36 points by Chamberlain, the Jayhawks won 73–65 to advance to the regional finals. There, the Jayhawks defeated Oklahoma City 81–61 to reach the Final Four. Chamberlain scored 30 points in the game, adding 15 rebounds. The two-time defending NCAA Tournament champions, San Francisco, faced Kansas in the Final Four's host site, Kansas City. With a field goal percentage of almost 60 percent, the Jayhawks posted an 80–56 win to advance to the championship game against undefeated North Carolina, the number one-ranked team in the country. The Tar Heels defeated the Jayhawks 54–53 in triple overtime; North Carolina's Joe Quigg made the tying and go-ahead free throws in the final seconds.\nRankings.\nFrom the beginning of the season, the Jayhawks topped the Associated Press Poll, holding their position until mid-January. After the Jayhawks' loss to Iowa State, the team fell to number two in the poll. Kansas stayed in that position for the rest of the season. In the United Press Poll, the Jayhawks held the top overall ranking at the start of the season and remained there until the January 22 rankings, when they fell to second behind North Carolina. They stayed in that position in each subsequent poll during the season.\nIn popular culture.\nThe team, specifically starting center Wilt Chamberlain and coach Phog Allen, where the focus of the 2014 film \"Jayhawkers\", which was directed by University of Kansas film professor Kevin Willmott. The film featured former Jayhawk basketball player Scot Pollard and Justin Wesley, who was on the roster at the time of the release.

        "text": "Hesketh Park is a cricket ground in Dartford in Kent. The ground is the home of Dartford Cricket Club, one of the oldest cricket clubs in the United Kingdom. The ground was established at the beginning of the 20th century and has been used as a first-class cricket venue by Kent County Cricket Club.\nThe ground is located around south-east of Dartford town centre and is one f the few open spaces which remain on what was once the Dartford Brent. The A296 road runs along the western side of the ground with the A225 road to the south and the A282 Dartford Crossing approach road running east of the ground.\nEstablishment.\nCricket has been played at Dartford since at least the early 18th century and Dartford Cricket Club is one of the oldest established cricket clubs in England. Cricket was first played on Dartford Brent, an area of common land to the east of the town on which the modern Hesketh Park ground is situated. The earliest known match between two county sides took place on the Brent in 1709 with a Kent team playing one from Surrey. After the end of the 18th century matches moved to Bowman's Lodge on Dartford Heath before Hesketh Park was established at the start of the 20th century.\nAn area of municipal park land was established at Hesketh Park in 1904 as a result of a donation by local businessman Everand Hesketh. The site was expanded in 1905 when Hesketh purchased land adjacent to the park to build a sports ground which includes the cricket ground. The first match on the ground was held in 1905, with Hesketh bowling the first over. The ground is owned by Dartford Borough Council and operated by the council and Dartford Cricket Club.\nCricket history.\nKent County Cricket Club used Hesketh Park for First XI fixtures between 1956 and 1990. The first first-class cricket match on the ground took place in May 1956 and saw Kent play Essex. A total of 33 first-class matches were held on the ground, with Kent playing a County Championship fixture at Dartford in most seasons from 1956 until 1990. In 1963 the county played twice at the ground, a Championship match against Northants followed by a match against the Pakistan Eaglets – a touring side of younger Pakistani cricketers. The final first-class match on the ground was held in August 1990 with Leicestershire as the opposition.\nKent have also played two List-A cricket matches on the ground, both against Essex. The first match took place in the 1978 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the second in the 1981 tournament. The Kent Second XI also used the ground 40 times between 1947, when they played Norfolk in the Minor Counties Championship, and 1995 when it was used in the Second XI Championship.\nDuring the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup the ground was used for a single Women's One Day International. Australia women beat New Zealand women on the ground with Australian opening batsman Bev Wilson scoring a half-century.\nIn local domestic cricket the ground has been the home venue of Dartford Cricket Club since it was established in 1905. The club plays in the Kent Cricket League. The pavilion on the ground was replaced in 2015, the new building replacing one which had been built in the 1980s to replace the original pavilion which had been built when the ground was established but was later destroyed by fire. The pavilion project was part funded by Dartford Borough Council with a grant of £1 million. A new area of cricket nets was built on the ground as part of the project. The ground has also hosted fixtures involving Lashings World XI.\nRecords on the ground.\nA total of 33 first-class and two List A matches were held on the ground, all with Kent as the home team.\nIn the two List A matches on the ground the highest team score was 226/4 scored by Kent chasing an Essex score of 222 in 1978. The highest individual score was 79 not out, scored by Bob Woolmer for Kent in 1981 in another successful run chase against Essex. The highest women's individual score on the ground was 50 runs scored by Bev Wilson.\nOther sports.\nHesketh Park is the home of Dartford bowls club. Grass and hard tennis courts are also available in the wider park."

College football was played at the 1904 Olympics, which was played at Francis Field, but was, in reality, college teams playing each other as part of their regular seasons. The sport was eventually played officially as a demonstration sport only once, in 1932. Though American football has not been played in the Olympics since then, various American football players have participated in the Olympics. The International Federation of American Football (IFAF) oversees the IFAF World Championship, which is an international tournament, which itself is held every four years.\nIn 2013, the International Olympic Committee gave provisional recognition to The International Federation of American Football, setting up a possible vote on its future participation in the Olympics. In 2015, American Football was not included in the 2020 additions.\n1904 Summer Games.\nSaint Louis University and Washington University in St. Louis initially sought to contest an Olympic football championship, but were unable to host it officially. Both teams ended up simply playing their regular seasons from teams around the country, making their status as an official demonstration sport dubious. St. Louis was declared the champion \"by default.\" As Francis Field was the main stadium for the 1904 Summer Olympics, only those games would have been considered a demonstration for Olympic crowds. Only two games at Francis Field were played that did not involve Washington University: a match between Purdue and Missouri, and the first match between two Indian school teams (Haskell and Carlisle) who were considered powerhouses in college football at the time.\nIOC rejection and the future.\nThough American football has not been played in the Olympics since then, various American football players have participated in the Olympics. In 2013, the International Olympic Committee gave provisional recognition to the International Federation of American Football (IFAF), setting up a possible vote on its future participation in the Olympics. In 2015, American Football wasn't included in the 2020 additions with critics voicing the IFAF's lack of effort and surrounding drama around the 2015 IFAF World Championship.\nFollowing the IOC's decline of the IFAF's application, the IFAF resubmitted its application, re-earning the provisional recognition for a possible addition in the 2024 Summer Olympics, with the earliest vote being as possible as 2017. It has also been argued that due to roster restrictions, seven-on-seven is the most likely style of play to make it as a medal event in the same vein as rugby sevens, which debuted at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nThe NFL and IFAF backed a proposal to include flag football, a non-contact variation of the game, as an event in the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The bid was successful and flag football was officially announced as a sport for the 2028 games in October 2023."

Under club stalwart Dave Porter, the 1st team attempted to win promotion back to Division 1, however occasional erratic form and an excellent Henley side ended Chesham's hopes, and were forced to settle for 2nd place, despite stellar bowling performances from Dave Porter and Peter Ongondo. However, signs of future promise were there as 8 of the team are under 21, and all came through the Chesham junior section.\n2011 season.\n2011 could not have started in a worse fashion for the club as the club's pavilion was burned down in an arson attack on 1 April. The club used portacabins for changing rooms during the season. Despite this, cricket continued to be played all summer and on field the club looked very strong. The 1st XI missed out on promotion to Division 1 by just 4 points, courtesy of losing the toss in the final game of the year at Falkland and being put in the field first, capping the number of points on offer to the side at 20, as opposed to the maximum 25. The 2nd XI started brightly but faded fast and finished mid-table while the 3rd XI won promotion to Division 5 in the shock of the year. Sunday cricket continued to thrive at Chesham with mixed on field results while the Women's XI won their league unbeaten. The club's primary focus, however, is to rebuild the pavilion and this requires raising £200,000 in a tough economic climate."

        "title": "2011 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2011 British Grand Prix (formally the 2011 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race held on 10 July 2011 at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, England, and won by Fernando Alonso. It was the ninth race of the 2011 season, and saw the introduction of a ban on off-throttle blown diffusers, the practice of forcing the engine to continue to produce exhaust gasses to generate downforce when drivers are not using the throttle. The race also saw the Formula One debut of future Grand Prix winner Daniel Ricciardo.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe circuit underwent a major reconfiguration for the 2010 British Grand Prix, with the addition of the \"Arena\" loop bypassing the old Abbey, Bridge and Priory corners before re-joining at Brooklands. The 2011 race saw the second stage of this reconfiguration used for the first time, with the pits and the start/finish line moved to the straight between Club Corner and the new Abbey. The new pit facility was deliberately designed to be challenging for drivers, and to minimise the amount of time spent in the pits. The entry lane branches off from the circuit on the approach to Vale and Club – one of the slowest sections of the circuit – allowing a pitting driver to continue to accelerate while others are forced to slow for the corner. The pit lane itself does not run parallel to the main straight, but rather is angled at five degrees to make the corner at the entry to the pit lane slightly faster. Red Bull Racing team principal Christian Horner noted that the pits are lower than the circuit proper, and that he believed that drivers would have to treat the corner at the entry to the pit lane as they would a corner on the circuit.\nFollowing complaints from MotoGP riders in 2010, the entry to the new Abbey has been re-surfaced to remove a large bump situated on the racing line. The reconfiguration was not without controversy, as the lowered pit lane meant that the pit garages were obscured from the view of the spectators by a retaining wall. Formula One Management reversed the intended pit lane order, placing the Red Bull Racing, McLaren and Ferrari pit garages behind the retaining wall, and moving the Team Lotus, Hispania and Virgin teams' garages to the visible end of the pit lane. The change in the allocation of garages was believed to be for the benefit of corporate guests in the Formula One \"Paddock Club\", a corporate suite housed above the far end of the pit lane obscured from view.\nAfter experimenting with two Drag Reduction System (DRS) zones in Montreal and Valencia, the FIA announced that the sport would return to using only the one DRS zone at Silverstone, with the activation point placed before Aintree corner, allowing drivers to deploy the system for the length of the Wellington Straight.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its silver-banded hard compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound. This was the same tyre selection that Bridgestone had chosen to bring to the British Grand Prix for the previous two years.\nOn 30 June, it was announced that Scuderia Toro Rosso testing and reserve driver Daniel Ricciardo would replace Narain Karthikeyan at HRT Formula 1 Team. With Mark Webber driving for Red Bull Racing, Ricciardo's debut marks the first time that two Australian drivers have competed in the same race since Alan Jones and Vern Schuppan raced in the 1977 Austrian Grand Prix.\nPractice.\nThe first ninety-minute session of the weekend was deemed wet. The initial lap times were slow, but as a dry line began to appear around the circuit, the drivers switched to Pirelli's intermediate compound, and lap times began to improve significantly. Mark Webber set the fastest time of the session, but experienced fuel problems and stopped on the circuit. Michael Schumacher finished second ahead of Rubens Barrichello third. The rain returned late in the session, and Kamui Kobayashi crashed heavily on the pit straight. Sauber were able to repair Kobayashi's car in time for the second session, where he finished third overall. The session was once again wet, with conditions worse than in the morning session; almost half of the ninety minutes had passed before any driver took to the circuit. A dry line gradually began to form around the circuit once again, prompting many drivers to start setting times. Felipe Massa finished the session fastest, nearly eight-tenths of a second clear of Nico Rosberg and Kobayashi.\nThe third and final practice session was held in the driest conditions of the weekend, interrupted by a brief shower early in the session. Sebastian Vettel finished the hour-long session fastest, six hundredths of a second faster than Fernando Alonso and four-tenths quicker than team-mate Mark Webber, whose progress was hampered by an early problem with his gearbox. Michael Schumacher also experienced technical problems, this time with his floor, and finished the session eleventh.\nQualifying.\nThe first qualifying period saw all twenty-four cars take to the circuit as soon as the session began in response to the imminent threat of rain; it was noted by teams and commentators alike that the old start line and Copse corner in particular were slippery. Several drivers topped the timing sheets, including Fernando Alonso, Mark Webber, Pastor Maldonado and Sebastian Vettel, with Webber ultimately setting the fastest time of the session. Alonso had an excursion into the gravel trap at Luffield, but emerged unscathed and went on to set his fastest time within two laps of the incident, while the Toro Rossos of Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi were caught out on the circuit as a heavy downpour began in the final five minutes of the session. Both drivers were eliminated, with Alguersuari qualifying seventeenth and Buemi eighteenth, allowing Heikki Kovalainen to enter Q2 for the first time since the 2011 Spanish Grand Prix. Timo Glock qualified his Virgin MVR-02 in twentieth place ahead of Jarno Trulli in the second Lotus T128 and Jérôme d'Ambrosio. The Hispanias of Vitantonio Liuzzi and Daniel Ricciardo qualified on the final row of the grid, with the Australian rookie half a second behind his team-mate.\nThe rain died down in the interlude following the first qualifying period, and when the second period began, the drivers took to the circuit on a variety of tyre compounds, including both the hard and soft dry tyres and the intermediate-grade rubber owing to the varying conditions around the circuit; the old main straight and Copse remained slippery, while the Vale and Club Corner were noticeably dry. Many of the drivers were simply performing sighting laps in an attempt to decide which tyres were best-suited to the conditions, waiting for lap times to be set on all compounds to establish a base lap time. Once the first lap times were established, the drivers pitted for the dry compounds and took to the circuit once more in another race to beat the weather. Almost every driver in the session was the fastest man on circuit at some point during the session, but once the circuit finally rubbered in, Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton start setting times two seconds faster than the rest of the field, led by Adrian Sutil. Felipe Massa went on to set the fastest time from Webber and Alonso, while a late lap from Jenson Button saw him through to the final qualifying period. Adrian Sutil was eliminated in eleventh, followed by Sergio Pérez. Michael Schumacher qualified thirteenth, the first time he had qualified outside the top ten at Silverstone in his career. Vitaly Petrov and Nick Heidfeld finished the session in fourteenth and sixteenth respectively – split by the Williams of Rubens Barrichello – in Renault's worst qualifying performance of the season. Heikki Kovalainen qualified seventeenth after setting just one lap time to preserve tyres for the race.\nThe final period began as the previous two had, with most of the drivers venturing out as soon as the circuit was opened. The front-running drivers planned for two separate runs, but were anticipating rain later in the period, making the early laps crucial. Meanwhile, Pastor Maldonado, Kamui Kobayashi and Paul di Resta opted for just one qualifying run. Mark Webber claimed his second pole position of the season, just three-hundredths of a second ahead of Vettel on their first run before the predicted rain arrived three minutes from the end of the session. The Ferraris of Alonso and Massa filled the second row of the grid, ahead of Button, di Resta and Maldonado. Button had been attempting a final flying lap at the end of the period, but was interrupted by the arrival of the rain and aborted the lap early. Kamui Kobayashi finished eighth ahead of Nico Rosberg, who, like Button, had his final flying run cut short by the conditions. Lewis Hamilton qualified tenth when he set a lap time on worn tyres before the rain arrived, denying him the opportunity to better his lap time. This session marked Sebastian Vettel's 14th consecutive front row start.\nRace.\nThe race started under difficult conditions, with a full wet track from the Arena to Chapel, but the remaining sections being dry; as a result of this all of the teams elected to run on intermediate tyres. Before the start Lewis Hamilton and Sergio Pérez slid off the circuit, with Pérez damaging his car's front wing. At the start Sebastian Vettel beat Webber to the first corner, while Jenson Button passed Felipe Massa. Lewis Hamilton made up four positions on the first lap after starting from tenth. The two Renaults of Nick Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov had a small collision at Vale, nearly taking Vitaly Petrov out of the race. The difficult conditions meant drivers were forced to nurse the intermediate tyres through the dry sections of the circuit to preserve the integrity of the tyres through the wet stretches. This resulted in the drivers having to stay out on the circuit as long as possible until the circuit became dry enough to switch to the dry-compound tyres, or else risk making an extra stop and losing track position.\nVettel started building up a comfortable lead ahead of Webber whilst Jenson Button struggled, first losing fourth place to Massa and then being passed by Hamilton as the 2008 World Champion climbed back up through the field. The Lotuses of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli became the first retirements of the race, stopping within the first ten laps of the race due to gearbox issues. As the first round of scheduled pit stops approached, Michael Schumacher collided with Kamui Kobayashi at Luffield, spinning the Japanese driver around. Schumacher was forced to replace his front wing and was subsequently given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing an avoidable accident; as the new pit complex was designed in such a way that drivers would spend a minimal amount of time in the pits, the stewards decided that a stop-go penalty was more appropriate than a drive-through. Kamui Kobayashi was given a similar penalty when he pitted due to an unsafe release that saw him drive over a wheel gun. Kobayashi would then go on to retire from the Grand Prix when his engine expired. Meanwhile, Jaime Alguersuari and Sébastien Buemi were fighting up the order from their poor grid positions, and both successfully passed the struggling Renault of Vitaly Petrov. At Force India, Paul di Resta was delayed in the pits when the team were expecting Adrian Sutil, and thus had Sutil's tyres ready in a similar incident to a mistake at the 2010 German Grand Prix, forcing di Resta to wait while tyres from his own allocation were found. The error dropped di Resta well down the order, and he eventually made contact with Buemi at Copse, damaging the Swiss driver's left-rear tyre. Yellow flags were displayed as Buemi tried to limp back to the pits, but his tyre soon disintegrated and he had to retire by the side of the track.\nThe second round of pit stops saw Vettel and Alonso enter at the same time, but an uncharacteristic mistake from the Red Bull mechanics meant Vettel was delayed and allowing Alonso to take the lead of the race. Vettel emerged in third behind Lewis Hamilton, and struggled to pass the McLaren driver as Alonso increased his lead. Red Bull would eventually pit Vettel for a third time to allow him to run in clear air. Meanwhile, Button pitted for new tyres but retired from the race after the front right wheelnut was not attached, leaving the wheel visibly loose on the exit from the pits and continuing Button's run of poor results in his home race.\nWith less than ten laps to go, Hamilton was told to start conserving fuel to finish the race. This slowed him to the point where Vettel and Webber were able to pass him and put him in danger of being passed by Felipe Massa. As the race entered the final two laps, Webber was close enough to Vettel to attempt a pass while Massa was visibly faster than Hamilton. Webber was given an order by the team not to pass Vettel, but ignored it. He was ultimately unsuccessful, and finished in third place. Behind them, Massa caught Hamilton on the final lap and attempted a pass into Vale corner. Hamilton, holding a defensive line into the corner, was unable to slow the car down in time and the two made contact. This forced Massa off the racing line through Club corner and across the line; Hamilton prevailed by two hundredths of a second, while Massa ran wide and crossed the finish line on the tarmac run-off on the outside of the corner. The stewards investigated, but no action was taken.\nAlonso won the race – Ferrari's only win of the 2011 season – sixteen seconds ahead of Vettel and Webber with Hamilton fourth and Massa fifth. Nico Rosberg finished sixth, five seconds ahead of Sergio Pérez in a career-best finish. Nick Heidfeld salvaged four points for Renault in eighth place and Schumacher recovered from his penalty to place ninth. Vitaly Petrov's failure to score meant that Mercedes took fourth place in the World Constructors' Championship. Jaime Alguersuari took the final point-scoring position in tenth, his third successive finish in the points. Daniel Ricciardo was the nineteenth and final classified finisher on his race debut.\nDiffuser ban and controversy.\nThe race also saw teams banned from using the \"off-throttle blown diffuser\" concept. Previously, teams had mapped their engines to burn fuel when the driver lifted off the throttle. This created exhaust gasses that were routed over the diffuser at the rear of the car, generating additional downforce. This counters the loss of downforce experienced with blown diffusers when the driver lifts off the throttle. Compared to a car with a conventional blown diffuser, the additional downforce produced while off throttle improves grip under braking and in slower corners while also making the car's handling less throttle sensitive. Some estimates suggested that this allowed teams to find upwards of one second per lap. Off-throttle blown diffusers had been a source of controversy when the FIA previously banned them at the , only to recant the ban twenty-four hours later pending a discussion with the sport's Technical Working Group, and prompting Hispania to threaten a protest of the race results. This led to speculation that engine supplier Cosworth had been unable to map their engines appropriately and thus could not take advantage of the off-throttle concept as none of the Cosworth-powered teams – Virgin, Williams and Hispania (as well as the Ferrari-powered Sauber and Toro Rosso teams) – were using off-throttle blown diffusers. Charlie Whiting, the FIA's technical delegate, ruled that off-throttle blown diffusers qualified as a movable aerodynamic part because the concept used moveable parts within the engine to manipulate relative levels of aerodynamic grip, and were therefore illegal under the FIA's long-standing ban on moveable aerodynamic parts. The ban stated that teams may only map their engines to use ten percent of available throttle power when under braking, with further restrictions to be introduced in . Adrian Newey, Red Bull Racing's technical director, admitted that his team had the most to lose from the ban on off-throttle blown diffusers because the Red Bull RB7 had been designed around the concept, in comparison to other teams who had simply applied it to their respective cars after the fact.\nFurther controversy erupted on the Friday of the Grand Prix when it was revealed that the FIA had allowed Renault-powered teams certain concessions over the ban. Where the ban prevented teams from running engine maps that simulated throttle conditions of more than 10%, Renault had applied for a special exemption to the rule on the grounds that running at 10% of full throttle conditions adversely affected the reliability of their engines. The FIA granted the concession, permitting them to run up to 50% of full throttle. This sparked a protest from the Mercedes-powered teams, in particular McLaren. Red Bull Racing's Christian Horner responded to the protest, stating that the Mercedes teams had been granted concessions of their own to manage pressure within the crank case. The FIA agreed to review the exemptions granted to the Renault-powered teams, and the concessions allowed to Renault-powered teams were revoked ahead of the final free practice session on Saturday morning; however, early reports indicated that the concessions granted to Mercedes-powered teams would remain in place, with Red Bull and McLaren team principals Christian Horner and Martin Whitmarsh seeking clarification over the matter with FIA technical delegate Charlie Whiting, who called an extraordinary meeting of the sport's Technical Working Group to resolve the dispute. Due to the teams' dissatisfaction with the situation, the FIA has stated that it is prepared to withdraw the rule change from the German Grand Prix, restoring the Valencia specification of regulations, which would allow teams the freedom to run engine maps at their discretion, but require them to use the same engine maps between qualifying and the race. However, team principals and technical chiefs failed to come to an agreement at an extraordinary meeting on Sunday morning, with the Ferrari-powered Ferrari and Sauber teams refusing to sign an agreement restoring the pre-Silverstone specifications. At a second meeting among the teams on Sunday afternoon, Ferrari and Sauber agreed to the terms of the proposal, abandoning the ban on blown diffusers for the 2011 season."

        "title": "2011 Japanese Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2011 Japanese Grand Prix (officially the 2011 Formula 1 Japanese Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 9 October 2011 at the Suzuka Circuit in Suzuka, Japan. It was the fifteenth round of the 2011 Formula One season and the 37th time the Japanese Grand Prix had been held. The 53-lap race was won by McLaren's Jenson Button, after he started from second on the grid. Fernando Alonso finished in second place for Scuderia Ferrari, and Sebastian Vettel completed the podium, with third, for Red Bull Racing.\nVettel had started the race in pole position alongside Button, whom he had marginally outqualified. The two drivers were the only two within mathematical contention for the title. Button attempted to overtake Vettel at the start of the race, yet was pressured towards the grass by Vettel which resulted in him losing his second position to third-placed starter Lewis Hamilton. Vettel was passed by Button in the second pit-stop phase, and was then passed by Alonso in the third. Hamilton slipped back from second to fifth, predominantly in the pit-stops; debris from a collision between himself and Felipe Massa caused a safety car period in the race. The second Red Bull of Mark Webber finished in fourth position.\nAs a consequence of the race, Vettel secured the World Drivers' Championship for the second year in succession, having only required one point prior to the weekend to be declared World Champion. Button remained in second place on the standings after his victory, extending the gap over third-placed Alonso to eight points. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's championship lead over McLaren was cut to 130 points, with Ferrari a further 96 points behind in third position.\nReport.\nBackground.\nSebastian Vettel entered the race knowing that either a points finish or Jenson Button's failure to win, would see him crowned the sport's youngest double World Champion. He led the championship on 309 points, 124 ahead of Button, with only 125 still available. Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber may have been out of the Championship hunt, but were both within 3 points of Button, on 184 and 182 respectively. Lewis Hamilton occupied fifth spot on 168 points. Red Bull led the Constructors' Championship with 491 points, ahead of McLaren on 353, with Ferrari no longer in Championship contention after Singapore.\nPrior to the race weekend, it was announced that Button had signed a new multi-year deal with McLaren after recent rumours surrounding his future. Button wore a special helmet for the weekend which featured a design in the style of the Japanese flag; he was to auction the helmet off afterwards to raise money for those caught in unfortunate circumstances during the times of the tsunami earlier that year.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound, as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the silver-banded hard compound as the prime.\nJust like the race in Singapore, a single DRS (Drag Reduction System) Zone was used in the race. The detection point was located at the exit of the high speed turn 15, better known as 130R, while the DRS activation point was 30m after the turn 18. Hence, the DRS was activated from the final turn down the start/finish straight up to turn 1.\n World Champion, Alan Jones, was the drivers' representative on the steward's panel for the weekend.\nPractice.\nThree practice sessions were held before the race on Sunday; the first two were held on Friday, and ran from 10:00 to 11:30, and 14:00 to 15:30 local time, respectively. The third free practice session was held on Saturday morning, before qualifying, from 10:30 until 11:30.\nThe first free practice session was held under clear skies and bright sunlight kept Suzuka with a steady track temperature of and air temperature of . Pastor Maldonado skidded off the track during the session, rejoined but later parked his car in an escape road, missing out on the rest of the session. At the end of the session, whilst trying to set the fastest time, Sebastian Vettel crashed his Red Bull Racing at Degner. He finished the session in third position behind the two McLarens of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton; Button on top by a tenth of a second. Vettel's teammate Mark Webber eventually finished the session fifth, behind Fernando Alonso. During the session, Nico Hülkenberg filled in at Force India for Adrian Sutil, and Karun Chandhok filled in for Heikki Kovalainen at Lotus.\nThe second free practice session was held in an air temperature of , and track temperature of . Button again topped the timesheets ahead of Alonso and Vettel. Bruno Senna and Kamui Kobayashi both spun during the session, but both drivers rejoined. Rubens Barrichello was less fortunate, as he crashed at the first Degner curve, having run wide on entry. He was later joined on the sidelines by teammate Maldonado, as his car ground to a halt, also at Degner. After the session, Hamilton, Michael Schumacher, Sébastien Buemi, Kovalainen and Senna were called before the stewards for ignoring yellow warning flags, but no penalties were given.\nIn the Saturday practice session, Button was fastest again, by half a second ahead of Hamilton and almost nine tenths ahead of third-placed Vettel. Alonso, Webber and Massa were separated a tenth and a half in fourth, fifth and sixth places. Senna crashed on the exit of Spoon Curve during the session, causing a short red flag period.\nQualifying.\nSaturday afternoon's qualifying session was divided into three parts. In the first 20-minute period, cars finishing 18th or lower were eliminated. The second qualifying period lasted 15 minutes, at the end of which the fastest 10 cars went into the final 10-minute period to determine their starting positions for the race. This session was held in dry weather conditions and the ambient temperature was , while track temperature was higher than any of the practice sessions at .\nIn the first qualifying session, Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi topped the timesheets to the delight of his local fans. He along with many other drivers had decided to use the soft compound tyres to elevate themselves into the second session. Red Bull Racing, McLaren and Ferrari along with Michael Schumacher had used the medium compound tyres to get into the second part. Schumacher's Mercedes teammate, Nico Rosberg failed to set a lap time because of a hydraulics failure, and would start the race from twenty-third. It was the first time in that Rosberg had failed to make the final session. He would be joined on the back row by HRT driver Vitantonio Liuzzi – who also experienced technical problems. Liuzzi's teammate, Daniel Ricciardo, would start twenty-second behind the two Lotuses and then the two Virgins, where Heikki Kovalainen and Jérôme d'Ambrosio outqualified their respective teammates.\nEvery driver used the option tyres in the second session apart from Pérez, who was prevented from setting a flying lap with a problem similar to Rosberg's. The Toro Rossos occupied the row in front of him, Sébastien Buemi ahead of Jaime Alguersuari by two tenths of a second; while there was a very similar story at Williams, with Rubens Barrichello in front of Pastor Maldonado on the seventh row. In the dying moments of the session, Kobayashi, Bruno Senna and Vitaly Petrov all set lap times quick enough to progress into the top ten. This meant that the Force Indias of Adrian Sutil and Paul di Resta would have to start eleventh and twelfth respectively. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time of the session with Sebastian Vettel and Jenson Button not far behind.\nAt the start of the third session, Kobayashi appeared on the prime tyres, and after setting two sectors of a flying lap he returned to the pits. Hamilton set the initial pace, he was followed by Button, Vettel, Webber and then Felipe Massa. Seven of the cars left the pits about two minutes before the end of the session; the latest cars to leave being Hamilton, Schumacher and then Mark Webber. Hamilton, possibly not realising he had little time in which to cross the start/finish line, was making a gap to Button in front and changing dials on his steering wheel. As he approached the final chicane, Webber shot up his inside and bolted to try to get across the line in time – which he did – Hamilton backed off, surprised by what had happened and also by Schumacher cutting straight across the chicane on the outside of him. Both Hamilton and Schumacher crossed the line after the flag had fallen and missed the chance to set a flying lap. Once all the flying laps had been completed, Vettel took his twelfth pole of the season, putting him in a prime position to clinch the title the following day. The only other championship contender, Button, lined up second on the grid, 0.009 seconds off Vettel's time, his first front row start since the . Hamilton was third, while Massa out-qualified teammate Fernando Alonso for only the third time in . Behind the two Ferraris was Webber in sixth place, who was disappointed after making an error in not opening his DRS between the hairpin and Spoon corner. Kobayashi was seventh, his highest ever qualifying place, because he had started a flying lap, unlike Schumacher, who lined up eighth on the grid. The two Renaults had also made an attempted to save tyres, and did not leave the garage, starting ninth and tenth.\nRace.\nJenson Button made a better start off the line than Sebastian Vettel, who also had a good start compared to some cars behind him. Button attempted to overtake down the inside, but Vettel covered aggressively and Button lifted off after being half on the grass which allowed Lewis Hamilton to take him down the outside of Turn 1. Button asked his race engineer soon afterwards \"He's got to get a penalty for that, hasn't he?\". Martin Brundle thought the move was \"harsh but not worth a penalty\", while Vettel said that he had not seen Button because Button was behind him. Meanwhile, home favourite Kamui Kobayashi lost his seventh-place qualifying slot, slipping to twelfth when his anti-stall kicked in at the start. Conversely, Paul di Resta made a good start to take eighth place.\nLap 6 saw Fernando Alonso take Ferrari teammate Felipe Massa into Turn 1, for fourth place; Massa made no attempt to defend the position. Hamilton was overtaken by Button on lap 9, after developing what the team believed to be a right-rear puncture (judging by their telemetry) at the time, before later discovering it was just heavy degradation. Hamilton attempted to compensate for the puncture by slowing through 130R before pitting and changing to the option tyres. The other front runners pitted within the next couple of laps, with Vettel remaining in the lead after the first pit-stop phase. Both Red Bulls pitted together for the second time each on lap 20, a 10.3 second gap only just ensured that Vettel left the pits as soon as Webber began to enter them. The good pace and low tyre-degradation of the McLaren proved quite useful for Button, as he took the net lead on the next lap after making his pit-stop, leaving Vettel a second behind him. Also on this lap, Hamilton and Massa made contact for the fourth time in , after Massa went down the outside of Hamilton on the approach to the chicane. Hamilton, seemingly unaware of Massa being there, went to take his normal line, breaking off a small endplate on the Ferrari's front wing. Hamilton blamed his wingmirrors for the contact, saying that they vibrated too much down the straights. Hamilton dived into the pits immediately afterwards, but a bad pit stop lost him more time putting him behind Massa and Webber, who had managed to pass Massa.\nThe awkwardly placed piece of debris that had resulted from the Massa-Hamilton collision caused the safety car to emerge on lap 24. Button slowed the pack up on the exit of 130R before restarting. Vettel pitted on lap 34, to begin his final stint on the prime tyres. Within the next three laps Webber, Massa, Hamilton and race leader Button all made their stops, all retaining position. This was until lap 38, when Hamilton overtook Massa in the DRS zone for net fifth place. Heavy traffic had slowed Vettel down on his out-lap, and Alonso moved into net second place after his stop. This left Schumacher in the lead, already being on the prime tyres, he had a longer stint before switching to the options at the end. He spent three laps in the lead in total, the first time he had led a race since the 2006 Japanese Grand Prix. When he pitted, he had got the undercut on Massa, putting Schumacher into sixth on options and Massa in seventh on primes. Schumacher's pace on the options meant that he initially challenged Hamilton for fifth but later backed off.\nVettel began to get closer to Alonso at this stage, diving down the outside of Turn 1 on a couple of occasions. He showed his frustration at having lost two places in the pits and at being unable to regain them when he wildly gesticulated after a Virgin got in his way whilst chasing Alonso. Throughout the final eight laps, Vettel was reminded by the team that he did not need to win the race, to win the Championship in Japan so he held position, as did teammate Webber who was in fourth. A large battle for the final points scoring positions began on lap 46, when Adrian Sutil went down the inside of 130R to pass Kobayashi for ninth. Teammate di Resta was falling back on worn out tyres though, with Vitaly Petrov taking eleventh from him only a few corners later. Petrov would then pass both Sutil and Kobayashi to finish the race in ninth place. Nico Rosberg would get ahead of both the Force Indias to claim the final points scoring position, overtaking Sutil around Dunlop on the penultimate lap. To worsen Kobayashi's race, he would eventually be taken by both Force Indias too, placing him a lowly thirteenth. Kobayashi's teammate, Sergio Pérez, made great use of a two stop strategy, by saving his tyres coming from seventeenth to eighth on race day. Force India just missed out with eleventh- and twelfth-place finishes. Lotus had a relatively successful day, finishing with both cars on the lead lap for the first time since their debut at Bahrain in 2010. This completed the most cars on the lead lap of a race ever, in Formula One.\nButton took his third victory of the season, and fifth consecutive podium, just ahead of Alonso, who was only 1.1 seconds behind Button by the time he took the chequered flag. Vettel became Drivers' World Champion with four races remaining, by finishing third, taking his fourteenth podium from fifteen races. Vettel also became the youngest double World Champion, and one of only nine drivers in the sport's history to successfully defend their title. Mark Webber's solid fourth place, only 8 seconds off the lead, ensured that Red Bull Racing had already amassed more points than in their previous year's World title with 518 points. Hamilton finished fifth for the second race in a row, followed by Schumacher, Massa, Pérez, Petrov and Rosberg, who completed the ten points scoring positions.\nPost-race.\nThe top three finishers appeared on the podium and in the subsequent press conference. Button was delighted to have won in Japan, a place which was particularly special to him, because his girlfriend Jessica Michibata was born there, and because he had driven for the Japanese Honda team during his career.\nButton was later quoted as saying: \"This is one of the most perfect circuits in racing with one of the most special crowds. It means a lot to me\", about his win. Martin Brundle congratulated Button on his race win, and applauded his recent form and driving throughout the weekend. Brundle was not the only one to notice Button's driving, with World Champion, Damon Hill saying: \"Button is now in the sweet spot of his career – he has become like a fine wine\".\nButton's teammate Hamilton however, did not get such a positive reception after his race. Martin Brundle criticised the amount of collisions that he was having. Even Hamilton himself described his race as \"shocking\", before admitting that he was \"gobsmacked\" by what had happened.\nMany drivers congratulated Vettel on his second world title, including Jackie Stewart who described Vettel as \"the most mature 24-year-old racing driver\" he had ever seen. Niki Lauda was also highly complimentary of Vettel, going as far as to say that he was capable of breaking Michael Schumacher's record of seven world titles. Damon Hill however, had the opposite view, describing Vettel's chances of beating the record as \"very unlikely\". He did, however, praise Vettel's abilities.\nAlthough, Vettel and Button were not the only ones receiving praise, Adrian Newey, Red Bull's chief technical officer, was congratulated by David Coulthard. Red Bull Racing left Suzuka with a 130-point advantage over McLaren in the Constructors' Championship, with a maximum of 172 points remaining at the last four races. Therefore, if Red Bull were to clinch the title at the , they would have to either score more than McLaren, or lose out to them by no more than a single point.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

        "title": "2011 Italian Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2011 Italian Grand Prix (officially the Formula 1 Gran Premio Santander d'Italia 2011) was a Formula One motor race that was held on 11 September 2011 at the Autodromo Nazionale di Monza in Italy. It was the thirteenth round of the 2011 Formula One season and was also the sixtieth time the Italian Grand Prix had been held at Monza. The 53-lap race was won by Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel, the World Drivers' Championship leader, after he started from pole position. Jenson Button finished in second place for McLaren, and Fernando Alonso completed the podium in third position for Ferrari.\nAs a consequence of the race, Vettel extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 112 points over Alonso, who moved up to second place in the championship. Button moved into third place in the championship, five points behind Alonso, and level on points with fourth-placed Mark Webber, but ahead on countback. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's championship lead was cut by McLaren to 126 points, with Ferrari a further 71 points behind in third position.\nTo celebrate the 150th anniversary of the unification of Italy a special trophy (named \"Coppa del 150° Anniversario dell'Unità d'Italia\") was awarded to the winner. The same trophy was also awarded to the winner of 2011 Giro d'Italia (cycling, won by Michele Scarponi) and 2010-2011 Coppa Italia (football, won by Inter Milan). The special trophy was designed by the Italian sculptor Silvio Gazzaniga.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its white-banded medium compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound, as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the hard compound as the prime.\nRegulation changes.\nThe Belgian Grand Prix saw a small controversy when several teams discovered their tyres had blistered during qualifying, but were not permitted to change their tyres ahead of the race because the damage was the result of the car set-up rather than an accident. Tyre supplier Pirelli pointed to Red Bull Racing's practice of running camber settings that were outside the recommended parameters given by Pirelli as the cause of the blistering, and said they would be more cautious with their recommendations for Monza to prevent the problem from arising again. Pirelli stated that they were willing to turn to the FIA to enforce camber limits if there was any evidence of blistering after the Free Practice sessions. Shortly before the final practice session on Saturday, the FIA announced that Pirelli's camber limits were mandatory and that any team who failed to observe them would be reported to the stewards under Article 2.3 of the sport's technical regulations for dangerous construction and would risk exclusion from the race.\nCircuit changes.\nAfter experimenting with two Drag Reduction System (DRS) zones with one activation point in Montreal and Valencia, the FIA reverted to a single DRS zone for Silverstone. At the , it was announced that the Italian Grand Prix would once again see two DRS zones, but this time, each zone would be independent, with one activation point for each zone. One of these zones will be placed along the main straight of the circuit, with reports suggesting that the second zone would be placed along the straight between the second Curva di Lesmo and the Variante Ascari chicane.\nOn Saturday morning, the FIA modified the della Roggia chicane, moving the kerbs at both corners back five metres to allow the drivers more space to navigate the chicane without being forced over the kerbs.\nTeam changes.\nBruno Senna replaced Nick Heidfeld at Renault for the Belgian Grand Prix, though Heidfeld expressed dissatisfaction with the appointment and stated that he hoped to return to racing for them at the and to finish the season driving for Renault, going so far to launch legal action against the team. In the week before the Italian Grand Prix, it was announced that Heidfeld and Renault had reached a settlement, allowing Senna to complete the season in Heidfeld's place. Senna's appointment prompted four new sponsors – Brazilian telecommunications company Embratel, oil and natural gas company OGX, personal care brand Gillette and pharmaceutical company Auden McKenzie – to join the team.\nAfter shelving a planned upgrade for the in light of a technical review of the team, Virgin Racing decided to re-introduce the upgrade for the Italian Grand Prix. The upgrade is a complete overhaul of the Virgin MVR-02, including a new engine cover, sidepods, exhaust and rear floor.\nStandings.\nHeading into the race, Sebastian Vettel was leading the Drivers' Championship on 259 points - a massive 92 ahead of Red Bull Racing teammate Mark Webber, after the pair had a 1-2 finish in Spa. Fernando Alonso sat third in the standings, 10 points behind Webber on 157. The McLaren duo of Jenson Button and Lewis Hamilton were now occupying fourth and fifth in the standings, with 149 and 146 points respectively. Hamilton had slipped to fifth, behind Button, because of his collision at the last race with Kamui Kobayashi.\nRed Bull led the Constructors' Championship, in a similar dominant fashion to Vettel, with 426 points. McLaren were 131 points behind on 295 points and Ferrari were third placed, 64 points behind McLaren. Mercedes and Renault had quite a gap to Ferrari, and were fourth and fifth placed, on 98 and 68 points respectively.\nFree Practice.\nThe Friday practice sessions were dry, with predictions of similar weather to last the entire weekend. The first ninety-minute period was quiet, with just two drivers setting times in the first half-hour. Once the entire grid started setting times, Sebastian Vettel emerged as the early leader of the session. However, Lewis Hamilton rapidly improved his lap times, and would end the session as the fastest man on track, a second clear of teammate Jenson Button and a further half-second ahead of Vettel. Button reported that the circuit had been resurfaced since the 2010 race, causing the cars to slide about. Meanwhile, several cars – most notably the Lotus and Virgin entries – were plagued with technical problems.\nVettel returned to the top of the timing sheets in the second session, just three hundredths of a second faster than Hamilton. However, Hamilton encountered Jaime Alguersuari whilst setting his fastest lap time, denying him the fastest time of the session. Alguersuari himself was impeded by Force India's Adrian Sutil, forcing the Spanish driver to move onto the grassy verge to avoid a collision. His Toro Rosso teammate Sébastien Buemi also left the circuit, crashing as he exited the Parabolica. Several other drivers experienced technical difficulties that limited their running; Daniel Ricciardo was only able to set a lap time three minutes from the end of the session after an electrical fault sidelined him, while Kamui Kobayashi pulled over at the end of the session and Nico Rosberg struggled with an undiagnosed problem in his Mercedes.\nDespite setting the fastest lap time in the second session, telemetry data from the speed trap on the main straight demonstrated that Vettel was noticeably slower than his rivals. Vitaly Petrov was the fastest through the speed trap, recording a top speed of ; by comparison, Vettel was the slowest driver on the circuit, with a top speed of , slower than Petrov.\nThe unique twin DRS zones around the circuit provided a challenge for the teams. The Drag Reduction System meant that drivers could run higher downforce settings than they usually would, offering more grip in the corners and unlimited DRS usage in the straights. Such a setup would invariably favour qualifying as the restricted use of DRS in the race could potentially compromise the driver's position. At the same time, a more-traditional setup would favour the race, but at the cost of qualifying position. This unique predicament forced many of the teams to run both setups in Free Practice to make a decision ahead of the race.\nQualifying.\nQualifying began in dry conditions at Monza, and the first qualifying period saw Pastor Maldonado crashing to the barriers at Parabolica early on. He was able to pit for a new front wing and return to the circuit, advancing to the second period at the expense of Jaime Alguersuari, who was eliminated alongside the Lotus, Virgin and HRT entries. Daniel Ricciardo out-qualified team mate Vitantonio Liuzzi for the first time, while Timo Glock narrowly bested team mate Jérôme d'Ambrosio, despite problems with his rear wing. Jarno Trulli out-qualified Heikki Kovalainen for just the second time in .\nThe second qualifying period was marked by the midfield teams attempting to advance to Q3. The Red Bulls, McLarens, Mercedes and Ferraris easily progressed with Vitaly Petrov in ninth, just one thousandth of a second behind Hamilton. Hamilton, who had initially used the prime tyres, returned to the circuit on the options, due to uncertainty of the security of his time, though Petrov remained in his garage. The remaining drivers were all competing for the final spot in Q3. Adrian Sutil briefly held tenth before being passed by Paul di Resta, and di Resta was outqualified in turn by Bruno Senna by a margin of 0.006 seconds. Behind the Force Indias, were the Williamses of Rubens Barrichello and Pastor Maldonado, with Sébastien Buemi sandwiched by the Saubers of Pérez and Kobayashi.\nIn the final ten-minute part, Ferrari sent both cars out together to give both drivers an opportunity to tow each other to a higher grid spot, though the strategy largely failed. McLaren followed with their second runs being more crucial; Hamilton made a mistake at the Variante Roggia, which caused Michael Schumacher to slow down. Jenson Button pitted after a mistake in the Parabolica, but qualified third behind Hamilton, by five hundredths of a second. There was a larger margin to Vettel though, who was half a second faster than Hamilton. It was Vettel's tenth pole of the season – joining Ayrton Senna as the only other driver to have taken ten pole positions in two separate seasons – and the 25th of his career. Alonso, Webber, Massa, Petrov, Schumacher, Rosberg and Senna – who did not set a lap time in the session – completed the first five rows of the grid.\nRace.\nFernando Alonso was the first driver into the first corner, having made the best start off the line from fourth. However, his lead was short-lived; further down the field, Vitantonio Liuzzi made contact with Heikki Kovalainen and slid off across the grass and directly into Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg. The three cars retired on the spot, while Rubens Barrichello was stuck in between the retirees’ cars undamaged, but was forced to wait until they were cleared, ruining his race. The safety car was deployed as the debris was cleared up, and when racing resumed, Sebastian Vettel quickly claimed the lead from Alonso. Vettel would remain unchallenged for the rest of the race, claiming his eighteenth victory. Meanwhile, Jérôme d'Ambrosio retired on the first lap with a gearbox problem.\nFurther down the grid, Lewis Hamilton was caught unawares by the restart and was quickly passed by Michael Schumacher, whilst Mark Webber challenged Felipe Massa for sixth place going into the first chicane. The two made contact and Massa was spun around, but was able to continue racing; for his part, Webber tried to limp back to the pits with a broken front wing, but crashed out at the Parabolica, recording Red Bull Racing's first retirement of the season. Adrian Sutil joined the growing list of retirements several laps later with hydraulic problems, pulling his Force India VJM04 over at the Ascari chicane.\nAs Vettel and Alonso increased their leads, Hamilton began to threaten Schumacher for third. Schumacher was warned over the radio several times for blocking by team principal Ross Brawn; Schumacher was taking a defensive line going into the Ascari chicane before cutting back over to the racing line. The battle with Hamilton slowed both drivers down enough that fifth-placed Jenson Button could catch up to them, and things came to a head when Schumacher cut Hamilton off at the Curva Grande and forcing him onto the grass on the inside of the corner. As Hamilton backed off, Button was able to pass him. Where Hamilton's fight with Schumacher would last thirty laps, Button passed the Mercedes driver on his first attempt, leaving him free to pursue Alonso. Hamilton claimed fourth from Schumacher when the German made his first scheduled stop.\nThe Sauber C30s of Kamui Kobayashi and seventh-placed Sergio Pérez retired with near-identical gearbox problems, reducing the field to just fifteen drivers plus Daniel Ricciardo. Ricciardo's car had gone into anti-stall on the grid before failing to engage a gear. The car was immediately returned to the pits while repairs were carried out, and although Ricciardo returned to the circuit, he was some eight laps behind the last-placed Timo Glock at the time of Pérez's retirement. Ricciardo would ultimately finish the race fourteen laps behind race winner Vettel, and was therefore not classified as a finisher as he had failed to complete 90% of the winner's race distance. With just fifteen drivers on the track, the Team Lotus drivers of Heikki Kovalainen and Jarno Trulli were able to secure 13th and 14th place, further reinforcing the team's claim to tenth in the World Constructors' Championship.\nVettel went on to win the race by 9.5 seconds from Jenson Button, who had caught and passed Alonso with less than ten laps to go. Once freed from behind Schumacher's Mercedes, Lewis Hamilton started catching Alonso at a rate that meant the 2008 World Champion would only be able to pass his former teammate on the last lap. Ultimately, it was not to be; Alonso completed the podium, crossing the finish line half a second ahead of Hamilton. Jenson Button scored his third consecutive second-place finish and fourth podium at Monza. After finishing fifth in Belgium, Schumacher repeated his performance with another fifth place, in front of Massa, whose race had largely been ruined by the early contact with Webber. Jaime Alguersuari scored a career-best finish with seventh place, ahead of Paul di Resta. The four points di Resta earned for eighth place, plus the double retirement of the Saubers helped elevate Force India to sixth in the constructors' standings. Bruno Senna scored his first World Championship points in ninth place, whilst Sébastien Buemi claimed the final World Championship point.\nPost-race.\nVettel's win extended his World Championship lead to 112 points ahead of Alonso, who took advantage of Webber's retirement to move into second overall. Vettel's result meant that a win in Singapore would be enough to secure his second World Drivers' Championship and become the sport's youngest double World Champion, provided Alonso does not finish second or third, and neither Button nor Webber finishes second. Button's second place moved him up to third overall in the points standings, though Hamilton's result was not enough to surpass the retired Webber, leaving him fifth overall and the last driver with a mathematical possibility of winning the championship, though several drivers conceded that they would not be able to beat Sebastian Vettel.\nFor causing the first corner incident, Vitantonio Liuzzi was given a five-place grid penalty for the .\nClassification.\nRace.\nNote:"

        "title": "2011 Monaco Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2011 Monaco Grand Prix, formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2011, was held on 29 May 2011 at the Circuit de Monaco in Monte Carlo, Monaco. Sixth round of the 2011 Formula One season, the 78 lap race was won by the championship leader, Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel who started from pole position. Ferrari's Fernando Alonso was second and McLaren's Jenson Button third.\nWinner Vettel extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 58 points over Lewis Hamilton who was sixth. Mark Webber finished fourth and maintained third place in the championship, six points behind Hamilton in third and three ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull extended its lead over McLaren to 61 points, with Ferrari being a further 68 points behind.\nReport.\nBackground.\nMany of the drivers were initially concerned that the Drag Reduction System (DRS) would prove to be unsafe on the narrow streets of the principality, and so lobbied to have the device banned for the duration of the weekend. Some elements of the paddock, including Williams objected to the ban, and use of the device was retained, with the DRS activation zone encompassing the front straight of the circuit, prompting Lewis Hamilton to comment that he did not think the of space allowed for the DRS would promote much overtaking. Following increased pressure from the drivers and FOTA, the FIA agreed to ban the use of the DRS in the tunnel for free practice and qualifying.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded super-soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound, as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the medium compound as the \"prime\" tyre. The Monaco grand prix marked the debut of the Pirelli red-banded super-soft compound.\nIn the build-up to the race, Hispania Racing team principal Colin Kolles suggested that the team would submit an official protest to the FIA over the use of off-throttle blown diffusers. Hispania had planned for an upgrade that would include the device for the before the FIA declared off-throttle blown diffusers to be a moveable aerodynamic device, and therefore illegal. Hispania then proceeded to abandon the planned upgrade. However, the FIA reversed their decision shortly before the Spanish Grand Prix, instead nominating to discuss the matter with the sport's technical working group. Kolles declared that his team believed the off-throttle blown diffuser concept to be illegal, and was considering a protest before the Monaco Grand Prix.\nSebastian Vettel and Lewis Hamilton were first and second at the previous Grand Prix, the week before in Spain; and although they were also first and second in the Drivers' Championship at this point in the season - the gap was not as close as it was in the Grand Prix. Vettel's 4 wins from 5 races had given him 118 points, 41 more than Hamilton's 77 points. Third in the standings was Mark Webber, 10 behind on 67, and Jenson Button was 6 behind him on 61. Fernando Alonso was fifth with 51 points - less than half Vettel's total.\nRed Bull Racing led the Constructors' Championship with 185 points and McLaren were second on 138 points (47 behind). Ferrari were third on 75 points and the battle for fourth raged on between Renault and Mercedes GP - who were on 46 and 40 points respectively. Before this race, Williams had had the worst start to a season in their history and were yet to score any points.\nQualifying.\nIn the third part of qualifying, Sergio Pérez crashed after exiting the tunnel, an accident similar to Nico Rosberg's in the earlier free practice session. However, Pérez was not so lucky as he smashed into the barrier used to separate the track and escape road, and qualifying had to be red flagged for more than half an hour, while Pérez was extricated from the car and the barrier was repaired. This meant that in the 2:26 time left, none of the remaining nine cars could improve their times due to the lack of heat and performance in their tyres. That meant that Vettel, who already had set the second fastest qualifying time in Monaco history, and Button who had set their times earlier in the session were better off than drivers who did not. Pérez's impact with the barrier was similar to Sauber driver Karl Wendlinger's crash in the run-up to the 1994 Monaco Grand Prix. As expected, the improved safety regulations resulted in Pérez's injuries being less severe, as he suffered a concussion and a sprained thigh.\nNeither Hispania driver was able to record a lap time during the qualifying session; Liuzzi due to damage sustained during the earlier practice session, and Karthikeyan due to a gearbox and a rear suspension failure. However, in line with the 107% rule the team were allowed to enter the race due to posting competitive times during earlier free practice. Kamui Kobayashi and Jaime Alguersuari had also been called to the stewards' room after Kobayashi slowed down whilst coming into the pits, blocking Alguersuari who was on a flying lap in the first part of the session.\nRace.\nVettel won the start from pole and led Button to the first corner, with Alonso getting around a slow starting Webber for third. Hamilton started ninth in the position vacated by Pérez but made little progress on the opening lap. Vettel went 2.4 seconds ahead of Button by the end of the first lap. Schumacher's anti-stall kicked in at the start dropping him to tenth at first corner, but he retook ninth from Hamilton at Grand-Hotel hairpin. Vettel continued to build a strong lead but his pit stop on lap 16 was slow and he was fitted with hard compound tyres due to a radio communication error. Alonso briefly led then but when he pitted on Lap 17 Button went to the lead. He stayed there until Lap 33 when he pitted and Vettel once again resumed the lead.\nOn lap 30 Glock's rear left suspension broke, so there were yellow flags for a brief period while they removed his car.\nAn incident between Hamilton and Massa caused Massa to crash in the tunnel, bringing out the first safety car. At the same time Schumacher's car suffered an airbox fire as he was about to pit, and he retired in the pit entrance forcing a safety car period while they cleared both cars. Vettel found himself leading behind the safety car and when racing resumed a battle between Vettel, Alonso and Button began. Vettel held the two former world champions behind him, despite being on tyres that had lasted since lap 16. As Button and Alonso fought for second place, the race looked set for an exciting climax, when an accident occurred involving Hamilton, Sutil, Alguersuari and Petrov. Sutil had hit the barrier on the previous corner, causing a right-rear puncture. Hamilton braked as Sutil lost control, and Alguersuari then ran into the back of Hamilton, damaging Hamilton's rear wing. Alguersuari hit the barrier, causing Petrov to do the same and both cars were out of the race, with Petrov being briefly trapped in his car. This brought out the safety car again and on lap 72 the race was red flagged, with the cars stopping on the grid at lap 72. During the red flag period, teams were allowed to change tyres and work on cars (unlike most motorsport, where tyre changes are not permitted during the red flag unless it is for a change of weather conditions). This worked to the advantage of Vettel, Alonso, and Hamilton. Vettel and Alonso had heavily used tyres, while Hamilton most likely would not have been able to finish the race with the damaged rear wing that required almost the entire red flag period to repair.\nAfter Petrov was extracted from his car and the track cleared, the race resumed still behind the safety car, which went in at the end of lap 73. On lap 74 there was a brief yellow flag period due to an incident between Hamilton and Maldonado, ending Maldonado's race with a broken front suspension. Vettel took the chequered flag, extending his lead in the world championship to 58 points. Vettel was closely followed by Alonso in second, with Button taking the final podium spot.\nHamilton had a difficult day, being penalised for causing two avoidable accidents, one involving Massa (for which he was given a drive-through penalty), and another with Maldonado for which he received a post-race 20 second penalty which did not affect his sixth placing. In an interview with BBC Sport, Hamilton criticised the stewards after the race, saying \"Out of six races, I've been to the stewards five times. It's a joke, it's an absolute frickin' joke.\" He later apologised.\nClassification.\nRace.\nNotes:"

        "title": "2011 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, formally the 2011 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix, was a Formula One motor race that was held on 25 September 2011 at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Singapore. It was the fourteenth round of the 2011 Formula One season and the twelfth time the Singapore Grand Prix had been held. The 61-lap race was won by Red Bull Racing's Sebastian Vettel, the Drivers' Championship leader, after starting from pole position. Jenson Button finished in second place for McLaren, and Mark Webber completed the podium in third position.\nAs a consequence of the race, Vettel extended his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to 124 points over Button, who moved up to second place in the championship. Fernando Alonso and Webber, third and fourth in the championship, were eliminated from championship contention. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull extended their championship lead over McLaren to 138 points, with Ferrari a further 85 points behind in third position, and no longer in a position to win the championship title.\nReport.\nBackground.\nThe build-up to the race was marked by accusations that Red Bull Racing had violated the Resource Restriction Agreement in , accusations that the team denied. The RRA is an agreement between members of the Formula One Teams Association designed to cut costs within the sport. The agreement outlines the teams' projected budgets – including both financial and non-financial elements, such as the amount of time spent using a wind tunnel – for upcoming seasons and limits them to using only as much as they had agreed upon. Following an audit from a Dutch consultancy firm, it was reported that Red Bull had violated the RRA when other teams – including McLaren, Ferrari, Mercedes and Sauber – had passed the inspection.\nVitantonio Liuzzi was handed a five-place grid penalty for the race for causing an accident on the first lap of the . His HRT team added a tribute to Christian Bakkerud onto their cars after Bakkerud, who raced in the 24 Hours of Le Mans twice for HRT principal Colin Kolles' team, died in a road accident on 11 September.\nScuderia Toro Rosso inadvertently broke one of its curfews when team principal Franz Tost arrived at the circuit \"too early\". Because the Singapore Grand Prix is a night race, it starts at 10pm local time instead of 2pm as the European races do, meaning that the timetable of events is different for the duration of the Grand Prix weekend. The curfew period is officially defined as the nine hours before the first practice session, and therefore takes up daylight hours at Singapore instead of the early-morning hours in Europe. As Tost entered the circuit before the curfew had expired, the team were considered to have used up one of the four waivers to the curfew that all teams were allocated for 2011. Red Bull Racing, Mercedes and Virgin all fell afoul of the different timetable on the Saturday morning. All three teams later had their curfew exemptions restored after they demonstrated that the early staff members who originally broke the curfew were not involved with working on their cars.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded super-soft compound as the softer \"option\" compound, as opposed to the previous year where Bridgestone brought the medium compound as the prime.\nA single DRS (Drag Reduction System) Zone was used in the race. The detection point was located at turn 4 with the DRS activation point 35m after the turn 5 apex. This resulted in plenty of passing into the turn 7 braking zone.\nThe race marked the 50th Grand Prix of Sébastien Buemi, who made his debut at the 2009 Australian Grand Prix, and was Sebastian Vettel's 50th race for Red Bull Racing.\nFree Practice.\nThe first practice session was delayed by half an hour to allow for circuit repairs to take place. Competitors in the Porsche Carrera Cup Asia support races dislodged plastic kerbing on Republic Boulevard and Esplanade Drive, forcing the Grand Prix practice session to be delayed while the offending parts were removed and the circuit deemed safe. When the circuit was re-opened, the practice session was shortened to one hour instead of the prescribed ninety minutes. Lewis Hamilton finished the session fastest, four hundredths of a second faster than Sebastian Vettel, who was a second faster than his teammate Mark Webber. Webber had previously had an on-track encounter with Timo Glock that destroyed his front wing and gave Glock a puncture, which ended his session. The session was interrupted several minutes later when Heikki Kovalainen's Lotus T128 caught fire in almost exactly the same place that his car caught alight in 2010. The session was stopped while Kovalainen's car was retrieved, and restarted, only to be stopped again ten minutes from the end of the hour. Felipe Massa had hit a kerb, dislodging it and exposing the bolt that was supposed to secure it in place. The session restarted with three minutes remaining, before the circuit was repaired ahead of the second practice session. Fernando Alonso was fourth, followed by Jenson Button and Massa. Narain Karthikeyan drove the HRT for the first time since Valencia in this session, in preparation for his drive at his home race in India. He finished the session 24th and last, one tenth slower than teammate Daniel Ricciardo.\nRepairs to the circuit were carried out before the start of the second practice session with kerbing at Turn 13 removed. When the lights went green, the Lotus mechanics were still trying to rebuild Kovalainen's car. Jenson Button's session ended prematurely when he locked his brakes and stopped just before the wall at Turn 14, and was unable to restart the car; however, the time he had recorded until then was fast enough to be tenth overall at the end of the session. Sébastien Buemi's session was also ended early, when he collided with the barriers at Turn 21, going too fast through the corner and damaging his suspension. Teammate Jaime Alguersuari also had little running before a mechanical problem ended his session, while Paul di Resta's session was also shortened after a hydraulic brakes issue limited him to eight laps in the session. Vitaly Petrov had been scheduled to run upgraded bodywork parts on his Renault R31, but the team discovered the car overheated, and were forced to abandon the new parts until Suzuka. Vettel set the quickest time in the session, two tenths quicker than Alonso, with Hamilton, Massa, Webber and Michael Schumacher completing the top six.\nCircuit repairs took place overnight in an effort to improve the kerbing and prevent the race weekend from being further disrupted. The kerbs at Turn 3 and Turn 7 were removed entirely, and replaced with painted markings, with the drivers to be briefed on what would be considered an acceptable racing line through the affected corners. The kerb at the entry to Turn 14 was likewise removed, but with no further plans to replace it, while efforts were made to secure the kerbs at Turn 13 and the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane. The FIA was unwilling to commit to one definitive plan, instead opting to reassess the situation once the initial work had been completed and again after the third practice session. The drivers expressed indifference towards the changes, with Felipe Massa commenting that \"it's not a big change having or not having it\", though he did point out that several drivers felt the kerbs at Turn 13 were unnecessary and that the FIA should consider the kerbs at Turn 5, which had previously gone unattended.\nQualifying.\nQualifying was marked by a distinct spread across the grid, with several teams reproducing similar times between their drivers, comfortably separated from other teams. Sebastian Vettel was fastest in the first period, half a second clear of Jenson Button. As the session drew on, it became clear that several teams were in danger of being eliminated. Vitaly Petrov spent most of the session in 18th, and improved on his final run, but teammate Bruno Senna was faster and relegated Petrov on his final lap. Petrov blamed a small error for compromising his run, briefly losing control of the back end of the car just enough to change his tyre pressures and costing him the tenth of a second he would have needed to advance to Q2. Senna claimed he had been impeded by Jaime Alguersuari on his flying lap, but the incident was not investigated. Heikki Kovalainen qualified ahead of Jarno Trulli, followed by the Virgins of Timo Glock and Jérôme d'Ambrosio and the Hispanias of Daniel Ricciardo out-qualifying Vitantonio Liuzzi for the second race in succession. Liuzzi received a penalty for causing a collision on the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix two weeks previously, but made no effect to his grid position of 24th.\nThe second session was red-flagged when Kamui Kobayashi crashed at the Turn 10 chicane. Missing the first apex, his Sauber C30 was launched into the air by the kerb on the second apex, throwing him into the barriers. Qualifying was halted while the car was retrieved and debris from the crash cleared away. Kobayashi's crash meant that he would fail to set a lap time and would start from seventeenth on the grid. When the session was restarted, Vettel once again led the way. Lewis Hamilton attempted a second flying lap during the session, but was forced to pit almost straight away when he picked up a puncture in his right-rear tyre. Under the sporting regulations, Hamilton would not be allowed to replace the damaged set of tyres with a fresh one, thereby depriving him of a set of option tyres for the race. Kobayashi's teammate Sergio Pérez was briefly inside the top ten and able to advance to Q3, but was knocked out at the last moment by Paul di Resta; the Mexican driver qualified eleventh ahead of the Williams pair of Rubens Barrichello and Pastor Maldonado. Sébastien Buemi and Jaime Alguersuari were fourteenth and sixteenth for Scuderia Toro Rosso, split by the lone Renault of Bruno Senna. Although, this made it the first time since the 2010 Canadian Grand Prix that both Force Indias had made it into Q3.\nThe third session began with four drivers queueing at the end of pit lane, an unusual sight in Formula One, as they would all be running in the dirty air generated by the cars in front. However, with a full lap of the Marina Bay circuit taking almost two minutes to complete, the drivers would have to race to get back to the pits on their in-lap if they intended to make a second run. Jenson Button led Fernando Alonso, Felipe Massa and Hamilton out of the pits. Hamilton later faced criticism for an aggressive move on Felipe Massa at Turn 19 on the out-lap; Massa later slowed down to let Hamilton through, compromising his flying lap as speed carried into the final corner would translate into a faster lap time. Massa questioned why Hamilton felt the need for such an aggressive move as opposed to slowing on his out-lap to allow for clear running. Force India also received criticism when both their drivers again elected to stay in the pits rather than set a flying lap; Mercedes' Michael Schumacher followed a similar approach, but did leave the pits in order to line up ahead of them.\nSebastian Vettel, who had waited in pit for the queue of cars to clear, once again rose to provisional pole. Jenson Button was second until Hamilton and Mark Webber claimed second in succession. Button took third from Hamilton with his second flying lap, but Hamilton was held in the pits with a fuel problem long enough that he would not have enough time to navigate the circuit and get back to the start line before the chequered flag fell, and he had to settle for fourth. Alonso and Massa were fifth and sixth, with Nico Rosberg the final car to set a lap time in seventh. Vettel attempted to set a second lap time, but made a mistake and aborted the lap; however, his original time was still fast enough for pole position, his eleventh of the season. The end result meant that the Red Bull Racing cars occupied the first row of the grid, the McLarens the second, with both Ferraris on the third row, Mercedes completing the fourth and the Force Indias the fifth row.\nRace.\nAt the start, Vettel kept his lead into the first corner, while teammate Webber fell to fourth. Hamilton tried to take Webber after a good start for third place, but had to back out and fell to seventh. Button and Alonso's good starts put them into second and third in the race. There was contact between Massa and Rosberg at Turn 1 forcing Rosberg to run straight across Turn 2 and filter in just behind Webber; he conceded the place back to Massa later in the lap. Ricciardo also made contact, forcing him to pit for a new front wing. Hamilton had caught Schumacher on lap 4, repassing him on the run to Turn 7, before passing Rosberg for sixth on the next lap. On Lap 10, Glock crashed at the final turn, and retired with rear suspension damage; whilst on the same lap Webber dived down Alonso's outside into Turn 14, Alonso then ran a bit wide allowing Webber to come down the outside again and take the position from him with a bold move at Turn 16. Alonso pitted on the next lap, switching from the option to the prime tyres. Meanwhile, Hamilton and Massa both pitted on lap 12, Ferrari winning the pit stop battle and with Massa staying in fifth place, and Alonso emerging at Turn 1 just in front of the pair, despite being held up by Barrichello. Alonso would also move back ahead of Webber, when Webber made his pit stop.\nHamilton attacked immediately on the out lap and made contact with Massa at turn 7. When Hamilton tried to go around the outside of the corner, he turned in clipping his front wing on Massa's tyre, causing both drivers – Massa with a right rear puncture, dropping him down to nineteenth, and Hamilton for a new front wing – to pit again. Hamilton was later given a drive through penalty for causing an avoidable collision. Behind Vettel and Button, di Resta had moved into third, after running a different strategy to the majority of his rivals. He kept this place until lap 19, when he conceded it to Alonso at Turn 7. He pitted not long after this, and fell to eighth behind teammate Sutil. Webber closed up behind Alonso and was half a second behind by lap 25, before Alonso pitted for the second time. Rosberg ran wide at the final corner on lap 29, which allowed Pérez and Schumacher to close up on Rosberg. Pérez took the defensive line for Turn 7, and Schumacher attempted to go around the outside. Pérez held the racing line, and Schumacher ran into the back of him, scattering debris across the track. Schumacher later described the incident as a racing incident, and that he had not expected Pérez to brake as early as he did. Schumacher retired while Pérez continued on relatively unscathed. The safety car was deployed while the debris was cleared, with many drivers electing to make pit stops, and as a result Vettel's lead of more than 20 seconds was wiped out.\nAt the restart, Vettel immediately pulled out a 4-second lead over second placed Button, who was stuck behind a train of backmarkers led by Jarno Trulli. Trulli was lapped by Kobayashi at Turn 1 while Button attempted to get past them. Webber passed Alonso down the inside into the \"Singapore Sling\" chicane, later describing the manoeuvre as spectacular. Martin Brundle also described the overtake, as \"opportunistic\". Even despite this overtake, Webber was already five seconds behind Button. Meanwhile, Hamilton began his recovery following his drive through penalty, and was up to sixth place on lap 38, before passing di Resta the following lap. Kobayashi was later given a drive-through penalty for ignoring blue flags, when Button had been stuck behind for over a lap earlier in the race. Trulli retired with a gearbox failure on lap 46. Webber pitted and changed to the option tyre on lap 48, and was temporarily overtaken by Hamilton. Button pitted the next lap and changed to another set of option tyres. This allowed Vettel to cover Button, and he pitted the next lap. As he exited the pits, the Lotus of Heikki Kovalainen was released into his path but he drove past Kovalainen in the pit lane exit. Alonso also made his stop on the same lap as Vettel, leaving him behind Webber this time.\nWith seven laps to go, Hamilton passed di Resta once again for fifth place, as teammate Button set the race's fastest lap. Massa also managed to get back into the points after his clash with Hamilton, as he passed Barrichello and Pérez to move into ninth. McLaren were still trying to pressure Vettel, and Button closed the gap to under four seconds by the time Vettel had cleared lapped traffic. Unfortunately for him, Button also had to clear this traffic, and just like Vettel, lost around two seconds behind the Williams cars. Alguersuari crashed at turn 18 on the penultimate lap, ending his day, but classified in 21st. Vettel was caught behind the Massa-Pérez scrap for ninth on the final lap as Button backed out of his fight for victory. Massa missed the chance to take eighth from Sutil by having to let Vettel through. Thus, Vettel took his third successive victory, leading from lights-to-flag for the first time since the 2010 European Grand Prix. He was followed over the line by Button, who was only 1.7 seconds behind by the end of the race, and took his fourth podium in a row. Webber completed the podium followed by Alonso and Hamilton. Di Resta scored his best finish in Formula One with sixth place, ahead of Rosberg, Sutil, Massa and Pérez, who rounded out the points.\nPost-race.\nThe result of the race meant that Vettel had not already won his second World Championship; but, with Hamilton failing to beat Vettel, Alonso failing to stand on the podium, and Webber failing to finish second, all three of these drivers were eliminated from Championship contention. Button became the only man who could stop Vettel now, finishing second in the race and moving up to second place in the Drivers' Championship. He was 124 points behind Vettel, with only 125 points still available, which meant that even if Button won all of the remaining races, Vettel needed just one tenth place to retain his world title.\nThis result also meant it was possible for Red Bull Racing to clinch their second successive Constructors' world title in Japan, by scoring 34 points more than McLaren.\nMassa expressed frustration with Hamilton, publicly criticising him after the race. He was already annoyed at Hamilton, following an incident in qualifying where Hamilton lunged down Massa's inside, attempting to pass on an out-lap. Massa also went up to Hamilton in the post-race TV interview area as he was about to start an interview with RTL Television, patted his shoulder, and sarcastically said: \"Good job, bro.\"\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\nNotes:"

        "title": "2012 British Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2012 British Grand Prix (formally the 2012 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place at the Silverstone Circuit in Northamptonshire and Buckinghamshire, England on 8 July 2012. It was the ninth round of the 2012 Formula One season, the 63rd time the event had been a round of the Formula One World Championship, and the 67th time it had been contested overall. The 52-lap race was won by Red Bull driver Mark Webber, who took his second victory of the season. The Ferrari of Fernando Alonso, who started the race in pole position, finished 3.0 seconds behind Webber, in second. Webber's teammate, Sebastian Vettel, completed the podium by finishing in third position.\nAs a consequence of the race, Webber narrowed Alonso's lead in the drivers' standings to 13 points. Webber himself was 16 points ahead of Vettel, who had moved ahead of Lewis Hamilton into third in the standings on 100 points. Red Bull extended their lead in the constructors' standings to 64 points. Ferrari moved up from fourth place to second whilst McLaren did the reverse and Lotus stayed in third position. All three teams stayed within 10 points of each other.\nThis would prove to be Webber's 9th and final career F1 victory and the last Red Bull Racing victory at Silverstone until Max Verstappen won the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix there in 2020. It was also the last British Grand Prix win for Red Bull until 2023 also with Verstappen.\nReport.\nBackground.\nJean-Éric Vergne was given a ten-place grid penalty for the race after causing an avoidable collision with Heikki Kovalainen during the previous race. Kamui Kobayashi took a five-place grid penalty for the same offence, having caused an avoidable collision with Felipe Massa in Valencia.\nAfter out-qualifying Toro Rosso drivers Vergne and Daniel Ricciardo in Valencia, Caterham announced plans to bring several upgrades for the CT-01 chassis to the race. Marussia joined Caterham in bringing significant updates to their car, which the Russian team described as their \"first proper windtunnel-generated update\" since abandoning their computational fluid dynamics-only approach at the start of the 2012 season. Test driver María de Villota was involved in a serious accident while carrying out a straight-line aerodynamic test of the upgraded MR01 chassis in the week preceding the race at Duxford Aerodrome. She was removed from the car with life-threatening injuries, including skull fractures and the loss of her right eye.\nLike the 2011 British Grand Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli brought its silver-banded hard compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre.\nDani Clos replaced Narain Karthikeyan at HRT for the first practice session, having previously driven the car at the Spanish Grand Prix. Valtteri Bottas took Bruno Senna's seat at Williams, while Jules Bianchi drove Nico Hülkenberg's car for Force India for the duration of the session.\nFree Practice.\nThe teams were due to test an \"experimental\" hard tyre compound developed by Pirelli during the first free practice, with a view to introducing it as a racing tyre later in the season; however, wet conditions made this impossible. Romain Grosjean was the fastest driver in the first session, ahead of Daniel Ricciardo and Lewis Hamilton. Fernando Alonso and the Force Indias of Paul di Resta and Jules Bianchi elected not to set lap times in the face of the difficult conditions.\nThe second session was similarly washed out and saw limited running as teams tried to preserve their wet- and intermediate-compound tyres. Hamilton was fastest, leading Kamui Kobayashi and Michael Schumacher as Grosjean elected not to set a time. Bruno Senna brought out a red flag that resulted in a ten-minute stop to the session when he hit a patch of standing water at Becketts, spinning and crashing heavily into the barriers. Fernando Alonso also encountered trouble, spinning and hitting the wall late in the session, but the Ferrari driver was able to return to the pits.\nThe third and final session was declared dry, but was run under the threat of rain and saw plenty of activity as the teams pushed hard to make up for lost time running in the wet on Friday. Charles Pic stopped on the circuit after twenty minutes, forcing the temporary suspension of the session while his car was removed. Pic later returned to the circuit, but stopped once again, and his car was removed by marshalls without forcing the session to be stopped. Alonso ended the session fastest overall.\nQualifying.\nQualifying started in wet conditions, and with the threat of more rain on the way, a queue of cars formed at the end of pit lane in the minutes before the session began. Once out, many drivers were instructed by their teams to keep going with their flying laps, even if they felt they had been impeded by a slower car because the rapidly evolving nature of the circuit meant that they could still set a fast lap time. Jenson Button was eliminated in eighteenth position when he could not find clear track space. His final flying lap saw him set sector times that would have been fast enough to avoid elimination by over a second and a half, but a spin on the main straight by Timo Glock brought out yellow flags, prompting Button to back off, where he was duly eliminated. Vitaly Petrov out-qualified teammate Heikki Kovalainen for the second time in 2012, with the Caterhams starting in eighteenth and nineteenth once grid penalties had been applied. Despite his spin, Glock's fastest lap saw him qualify twentieth, ahead of both HRT drivers, with Pedro de la Rosa once again out-qualifying Narain Karthikeyan. Charles Pic failed to set a lap time within 107% of the fastest time in the session, set by Sebastian Vettel.\nThe weather delivered on its promise of more rain, inundating the circuit ahead of Q2. The session was red-flagged with just over six minutes remaining after four cars span off within the space of a minute, and Sauber's Sergio Pérez at the top of the time sheets. The stoppage lasted for ninety-two minutes while race officials waited for the rain to stop and the circuit to clear. When the session re-opened, the seventeen drivers would have enough time left over for one set of flying laps, forcing them to choose between the intermediate and wet-weather compounds as the length of a lap in the wet meant that the drivers would not have enough time to pit and change tyres if they made the wrong choice. Pérez chose the intermediate compound which quickly proved to be the wrong choice as he rapidly plummeted down the order, and finished slowest. He would start the race fifteenth after penalties were applied. Paul di Resta's final lap gave him a provisional start in Q3, but he was eliminated in the final moments of the session and started eleventh. Kamui Kobayashi was twelfth, but dropped to seventeenth when his penalty from Valencia was applied. Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo finished thirteenth and fourteenth, ahead of Bruno Senna who admitted to being \"too conservative\" in qualifying. Jean-Éric Vergne qualified sixteenth, but was moved to the back of the grid once his penalty was applied. Romain Grosjean made it through to Q3, but spun at the end of the period at the Vale chicane, and took no further part in the session.\nQ3 was fought between the Ferraris, Red Bulls and Michael Schumacher's Mercedes. Fernando Alonso and Felipe Massa quickly locked out the front row of the grid, until late laps from Mark Webber and Sebastian Vettel left the Red Bull cars first and second. Massa was unable to improve his lap time and finished fifth, while Schumacher pushed Webber off pole. Webber reclaimed it with his next lap, only to lose it in turn to Alonso on the Spaniard's final lap of the session. Kimi Räikkönen, the last driver to set a time, finished sixth, ahead of Pastor Maldonado and Lewis Hamilton. Nico Hülkenberg was ninth, which became fourteenth when he took a five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change.\nRace.\nAn engine failure on Vitaly Petrov's Caterham on his way round to the grid meant he had to return to the pits and retire the car before the race had even begun. When it did, however, it was polesitter Alonso who maintained his lead into the first corner. Webber and Schumacher followed him round in their same positions, but Vettel fell prey to Massa and Räikkönen, before quickly getting back past the Finn. Paul di Resta, in tenth place at the time, suffered a puncture as a result of his right rear tyre coming into contact with Romain Grosjean's front wing at the start of the Wellington straight. Di Resta spun and retired from the damage on the following lap whilst Grosjean pitted on the third lap to replace his front wing and change tyres after his impaired front wing was costing him places.\nLater on in the race, Sergio Pérez and Pastor Maldonado had an incident at Brooklands at the end of the Wellington Straight. Maldonado tried to overtake Pérez on the inside of the corner under braking, whilst Pérez was defending on the inside line Maldonado's front wing clipped Pérez's car and sent both of them into a spin, the result of this would be Pérez retiring from the race and Maldonado having to make an unscheduled pit stop to repair damage to his front wing. This would be a disaster for his strategy in the race because a lap earlier, he pitted for new tyres, Maldonado would later finish 16th in the race.\nAt the start of lap 50, Mark Webber was closing in on race leader Fernando Alonso, with Vettel shortly behind his teammate in 3rd place. Webber was faster than Alonso due to his tyres being worn more than Webber's, but then with 3 laps to go Webber was within a second of Alonso's car, this would mean he was eligible to use DRS in the allocated DRS zone on the Wellington Straight, this would give him extra speed. Alonso knew he was slower than Webber so he took the inside line as Webber passed Alonso for the lead of the race, Alonso tried to attack on him in the next few corners. Now Vettel would try and close up on Alonso.\nWhen the chequered flag fell, Mark Webber won his second British Grand Prix, following his victory in 2010. Alonso was 2nd, Vettel not having the pace to catch Alonso and remaining 3rd. Felipe Massa finished 5 seconds behind Vettel, Romain Grosjean recovered from the first lap incident to finish sixth, behind his teammate Kimi Räikkönen. The other points scorers were Schumacher, Hamilton, Senna, and Jenson Button in 10th.\nPost-race.\nPastor Maldonado from the Williams team received a 10,000 euro fine for an incident with Sauber's Sergio Pérez.\nSauber's other driver Kamui Kobayashi received a 25,000 euro fine for crashing into four pit crew members in a manoeuvre that was described as a 'very dangerous move which had potentially serious implications'.\nThe race also introduced a twist in the post-race television unilateral interview; instead of Webber, Alonso, and Vettel proceeding to the interview room in the media centre, Jackie Stewart conducted the televised interview on the podium, allowing the drivers to address the crowd directly. The drivers then proceeded to the interview room for the press conference with assembled media. This form of post-race interviewing was used in every race until the 2018 Chinese Grand Prix.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

It was the thirteenth race of the 2012 season, and the final race in Europe before the teams returned to Asia for the Singapore Grand Prix.\nLewis Hamilton qualified on pole, ahead of teammate Jenson Button. The result gave McLaren their sixty-second front-row lock-out, breaking the previous record set by Williams. Hamilton won the race by four seconds from Sergio Pérez, with Fernando Alonso completing the podium.\nThis was McLaren's last win at Monza until 2021.\nReport.\nBackground.\nTyre supplier Pirelli brought its silver-banded hard compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the white-banded medium compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre.\nCircuit changes.\nThe drag reduction system zones used in 2011 were shortened for the 2012 race. The first DRS zone, located on the straight between the second Lesmo corner and the Variante Ascari, was shortened by fifty meters, while the DRS zone on the front straight was shortened by five meters.\nDriver penalties.\nLotus driver Romain Grosjean did not participate in the race due to receiving a one-race ban for his involvement in the first-lap incident at the Belgian Grand Prix that saw four cars crash heavily at the La Source hairpin. Grosjean was replaced by the team's testing and reserve driver, Jérôme d'Ambrosio. Estonian Kevin Korjus became reserve driver for the weekend.\nPastor Maldonado received two five-place grid penalties. the first for jumping the start of the Belgian Grand Prix and the second for causing an avoidable accident with Timo Glock after Grosjean's accident.\nPaul di Resta was also demoted five places for an unscheduled gearbox change on Saturday morning, his second gearbox penalty of the season.\nDriver changes.\nMa Qinghua became the first Chinese driver to take part in a Grand Prix weekend when he drove Narain Karthikeyan's HRT F112 in the first free practice session on Friday morning. Valtteri Bottas drove Bruno Senna's Williams FW34 in the same session, while Jules Bianchi took Paul di Resta's place at Force India.\nFree practice.\nMercedes AMG driver Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session, three-tenths of a second quicker than Jenson Button and Nico Rosberg. For Lotus, Jérôme d'Ambrosio finished the session fifteenth, over a second and a half slower than Schumacher and sixth-tenths down on teammate Kimi Räikkönen. Ma Qinghua was the slowest runner after ninety minutes, nearly six seconds slower than Schumacher, and within two seconds of teammate Pedro de la Rosa. At the end of the session, both Fernando Alonso and Pastor Maldonado were observed to stop on the circuit with technical problems.\nLewis Hamilton was the fastest driver in the second session, narrowly edging out Button and Alonso, the latter of whom had another disrupted session with a series of technical problems surrounding the gearbox and brakes that limited his time on the circuit. Having set the fastest time in the morning session, Schumacher finished tenth following a series of off-track excursions. He was highly-critical of the speed bumps placed around the Variante della Roggia chicane, claiming they were a safety hazard that could result in serious injury if a driver hit them at speed.\nHamilton was once again fastest in the third session, just one thousandth of a second ahead of Alonso. Paul di Resta finished the session third, while Sebastian Vettel suffered a loss of power on his final lap and pulled over at the Roggia chicane. The Red Bull RB8 was consistently one of the slowest cars through the speed trap, evidenced by the way neither Red Bull driver featured in the top ten runners in any of the free practice sessions, with the exception of Mark Webber, who set the ninth-fastest time of the first session.\nRace.\nFelipe Massa made a great start to pass Jenson Button for second place. He pulled alongside pole sitter Lewis Hamilton going into the first chicane, but Hamilton had the inside line and was able to stay ahead. Fernando Alonso was able to make his way up from 10th to 7th place by the end of the first lap, and passed Kimi Räikkönen for 6th going into the first chicane on the second lap.\nOn lap 4, Sebastian Vettel passed Michael Schumacher under braking into the first chicane for 4th place. One lap later, Bruno Senna attempted to pass Nico Rosberg around the outside into the first chicane. Senna turned into Rosberg, they banged wheels, and Senna went straight through the chicane to take 11th. Fernando Alonso was able to pass Schumacher coming out of the Parabolica on lap 7.\nOn lap 8, Bruno Senna tried to pass Paul di Resta on the outside going into the second chicane. Di Resta moved over, forcing Senna onto the gravel. Senna went straight through the chicane and back onto the racing line right in front of Mark Webber, who dodged around him as they entered the first Lesmo corner. On the next lap, Jean-Éric Vergne had a right rear suspension failure under braking into the first chicane. He spun and slid sideways over one of the curbs, launching his car into the air over the chicane.\nJenson Button retook 2nd place from Felipe Massa in the 2nd chicane on lap 19, who was suffering from a loss of telemetry and pitted on lap 20. Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel pitted at the same time on lap 21, and came out right behind Massa with only a car's length separating each of the three. Lewis Hamilton pitted on lap 24, allowing Sergio Pérez, who hadn't pitted yet, to take the lead from 2nd.\nOn lap 26, Fernando Alonso tried to go around the outside of Sebastian Vettel through Curva Grande. Vettel moved to the outside, pushing Alonso off the track and onto the grass. Alonso managed to keep control of his car and was furious at Vettel's antics. The move was similar to a move Vettel pulled on Alonso the year before, but this time Vettel was given a drive-through penalty. Alonso was able to pass Vettel on lap 29, and the drive-through on lap 35 put Vettel in 9th place behind Webber.\nLewis Hamilton retook the lead from Sergio Pérez on lap 29 at the first chicane. Pérez pitted on the next lap and came back out in 8th place. Jenson Button retired on lap 34 following a sudden loss of fuel pressure. This moved Felipe Massa back up to 2nd with Fernando Alonso and Sergio Pérez gaining on him. Massa was passed by Alonso on lap 40, and then by Pérez three laps later. Pérez quickly chased down Alonso and passed him on lap 46.\nSebastian Vettel retired on lap 47 with a failed alternator. On lap 51, Mark Webber clipped the curb on the exit of the Ascari chicane and spun. He fell out of the point-scoring positions and retired due to severely flat-spotted tires.\nLewis Hamilton won the race, completing a 3 race win streak for McLaren. In 2nd was Sergio Pérez, who started 12th, and was quickly catching him in the latter changes of the race. Fernando Alonso completed the podium to the joy of the Tifosi, having started 10th.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\nSebastian Vettel, Nico Hülkenberg and Mark Webber retired but were classified as they completed more than 90% of the winner's race distance\nChampionship standings after the race.\nDrivers' Championship standings\nConstructors' Championship standings"

        "text": "The 2012 Monaco Grand Prix (formally the Formula 1 Grand Prix de Monaco 2012) was a Formula One motor race that took place in the principality of Monaco on 27 May 2012. It was the sixth round of the 2012 season, and the seventieth running of the Monaco Grand Prix. The race was supported by the GP2, GP3 and Formula Renault 3.5 series. Mark Webber's victory created a new record for Formula One in that there had never been six different winners of the opening six Grands Prix of the season before. Mercedes' Nico Rosberg came in second place, his second podium in the 2012 season, and Ferrari's Fernando Alonso third and taking the Formula One championship lead by three points over Vettel and Webber.\nReport.\nBackground.\nLike the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded super-soft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre. It was the first time for the season that the super-soft compound made an appearance at a race weekend.\nCircuit changes.\nThe circuit underwent some extensive changes in the aftermath of Sergio Pérez's accident during qualifying for the 2011 Monaco Grand Prix. Pérez crashed heavily at the Nouvelle Chicane, suffering a concussion and a sprained thigh. He was unable to take part in the race. In response to this, the event organisers had the approach to the chicane smoothened by lowering the tarmac , and the barrier that Pérez hit was moved back a further . Other changes included the widening of the pit exit and the removal of nearby trees to allow a driver re-joining the race greater visibility. TecPro barriers were also added at Sainte Dévote and Piscine.\nDriver penalties.\nMichael Schumacher was given a five-place grid penalty for causing an avoidable collision with Bruno Senna during the Spanish Grand Prix. Pastor Maldonado was given a ten-place grid penalty for causing an avoidable collision with Sergio Pérez during the final free practice session. He then received another five-place grid penalty for a gearbox change.\nQualifying.\nQualifying took place at 14:00 local time under fine and sunny conditions with an ambient temperature of and a track temperature of .\nQ1.\nCharles Pic and Jean-Éric Vergne were the first cars to emerge from pit lane once the twenty-minute session was given the green light to begin. Pic's first flying lap was ruined when he was blocked by the slow-moving HRT of Pedro de la Rosa at Rascasse, forcing the Frenchman to pit.\nSauber's Sergio Pérez crashed heavily at the Swimming Pool, striking the outer barrier with enough force to remove a wheel. The session was red-flagged due to his crash (for the second year in succession) for six minutes while the car was removed. During replays of the incident, commentators observed Pérez shouting \"power steering!\" over his radio moments before the crash. Pérez's left-front steering was damaged, leading to speculation that the crash had been a by-product of the incident with Pastor Maldonado in the third free practice session.\nWith eight minutes remaining Mercedes driver Michael Schumacher led teammate Nico Rosberg with several drivers close behind. Defending World Champion Sebastian Vettel opted for a set of super-soft tyres late in the session, as his time from his stint on the slower soft tyres had left him in 16th place. Both Lotus drivers waited late to set their first timed lap, both opting for soft tyres. However, while Romain Grosjean set a competitive lap time, Kimi Räikkönen was not so quick and was only half a second ahead Caterham's Heikki Kovalainen and in danger of being eliminated. Räikkönen switched to a set of super-soft compounds and was able to avoid elimination.\nNico Hülkenberg set the fastest time of the session while on super-softs, while at the back of the field, Kovalainen out-qualified teammate Vitaly Petrov by eight-tenths of a second, with Marussia's Timo Glock a further half-second behind. Pedro de la Rosa was also eliminated ahead of Pic and teammate Narain Karthikeyan. As he did not set a lap time, Sergio Pérez was twenty-fourth and last, though this became twenty-third when Maldonado's grid penalties were applied. Prior to the session, Pérez had been the only driver on the grid who had not been eliminated in Q1 since the introduction of the knockout qualifying system.\nQ2.\nForce India driver Paul di Resta was first out followed by Williams's Bruno Senna for the fifteen-minute session. All cars were out on track early, however Jean-Éric Vergne damaged his front wing and suspension after he hit the wall under braking on the exit of the tunnel. Vergne limped back to the pits where he was subsequently eliminated.\nAfter the early phases of timed laps, Rosberg was fastest on 1:15.022. Six minutes of the Q2 session remained when Vettel pitted with complaints about the front of his car \"jumping like a rabbit\". After opting for soft tyres early on, both Lotus cars eventually went for super-soft tyres along with the rest of the field. Late in the session, the first driver into the 1:14 bracket was Felipe Massa in his Ferrari.\nAs time ran out, McLaren driver Jenson Button, was 11th and in the elimination zone, along with the Lotuses, Toro Rossos, Di Resta and Senna. Grosjean and Räikkönen were able to set laps good enough to push German Nico Hülkenberg and the sole remaining Sauber of Kamui Kobayashi out of qualifying and into 11th and 12th places, respectively. Button was unable to improve on his previous lap and missed entry to the Q3 session by two-tenths of a second. It was the first time since the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix that Button had missed Q3 in consecutive race weekends. Behind Button were Senna, di Resta and Daniel Ricciardo.\nAt the end of the period, just 0.967 of a second separated the top sixteen drivers.\nQ3.\nThe Mercedes of Nico Rosberg was the first car on track followed by Pastor Maldonado. The ten-minute session was split into two informal phases: initial competitive timed laps followed by short rest at the pits, then a frantic run at the end of the session. In the first five minutes, Vettel and the two Ferrari drivers were the only drivers not to set timed laps.\nRosberg and Lewis Hamilton both went out on a brand new set of super-soft tyres, while others fitted used tyres of the same compound. After the initial runs, Rosberg (who completed two timed laps) led the Lotus of Grosjean, followed by Mark Webber. The gap between the top three was just over one tenth of a second, meaning that no driver had the comfort of knowing his lap time would be sufficient to hold his current position.\nWith three minutes left of the session, the top five cars at the time pitted and awaited for their final attack on qualifying. At this stage, both Ferraris went out onto the track for the first time in the session, along with Vettel. However, Vettel left the pit with the slower soft tyres fitted. It became clear by his slow pace that he would – as in Spain – not complete a timed lap so as to have the option of starting the race on either type of dry compound tyres.\nWebber, Grosjean and Rosberg all went out again on an unused set of the red-banded super-soft compound, but their initial times remained unchallenged. All cars were by then on the track, with the exception of Vettel. As the chequered flag fell upon the session, it was Webber who was ahead of Rosberg, after having set the fastest second and third sector times. Hamilton and Massa fell short of Webber's time, leaving Schumacher, Rosberg and Grosjean the only drivers capable of taking pole from Webber, as they were the only drivers to still on a timed lap.\nSchumacher was the only one to eclipse Webber's time and did so by only eight hundredths of a second. It was the first time he had been fastest in qualification since his comeback after he left the sport in 2006. Unfortunately for him, he would have to start from sixth on the grid due to his penalty from the previous race. This elevated Red Bull driver Webber to pole position, the tenth of his career. The second Mercedes of Rosberg was third, with Hamilton in fourth and Grosjean in fifth, although all, along with Fernando Alonso, would also gain a place due to Schumacher's penalty. Alonso was six-tenths of a second off the pole time, leading Massa, who qualified in the top ten for the first time in 2012. Kimi Räikkönen was eighth fastest, followed by Maldonado, whose ten-place grid penalty and subsequent penalty for a gearbox change would drop him from ninth to last on the grid. Vettel was promoted to ninth, and would start alongside the Force India of Nico Hülkenberg.\nPost qualifying.\nSchumacher was extremely happy with his best qualifying performance since his return to Formula One racing. The seven time world champion stated \"It is simply a wonderful feeling to set pole after such a long time, and particularly here in Monaco. Okay, it has taken a little bit longer than I might have wanted in the second chapter of my career, but that makes it even sweeter. It's just beautiful\". Schumacher came into qualifying knowing that his five-place grid penalty would mean that his best possible grid position was sixth. Knowing this, in the Wednesday pre-race press conference Schumacher rather humorously stated he would have to qualify in first position. True to his word Schumacher later stated in the post-qualifying press conference \"I told you guys already in the press conference, my situation is going to be pole, start the race in sixth and I'm going to win it\".\nStruggling Ferrari driver Felipe Massa was upbeat about his best qualifying performance of the 2012 season saying \"I am very happy with how things have gone in this Grand Prix so far. Finally, I am having fun at the wheel of the F2012\".\nAdding to Maldonado's ten-place grid penalty for colliding with Mexican Sergio Pérez in free practice three (FP3), the Williams team decided to make a gearbox change and incur a further five-place grid penalty. Pérez, who failed to set a qualifying time, also decided to take a gearbox change and was penalised with a five-place grid penalty. Maldonado started in 24th with the Mexican ahead of him in 23rd.\nRace.\nThe Monaco Grand Prix was the sixth of the season and began at 12:00 UTC (14:00 local). Conditions for the race were sunny with an ambient temperature of and a track temperature of . Rain was forecast for the day but it was unclear whether the race would be affected. The race begun with humidity at 58%. Sebastian Vettel, Jenson Button, Paul di Resta, Vitaly Petrov and Pedro de la Rosa were the only drivers to start on the slower yellow-banded soft compound tyre, with the rest of the field either opting or being forced (by qualifying rules) to start on the red-banded super-soft compound.\nAs the race started both Mark Webber and Nico Rosberg got away cleanly and were first and second, respectively, as the field squabbled behind them. Fernando Alonso squeezed through the gap between Grosjean and McLaren's Lewis Hamilton, but Grosjean clipped the rear left wheel of the Ferrari which in turn pushed him to the outside of the track and into the path of fast starting Michael Schumacher. Schumacher had nowhere to go as he was already right next to the wall and as a result Grosjean's left rear wheel was forced into and over the Mercedes car's front right, which severely damaged the Lotus's suspension. This sent Grosjean into a spin and he ended up broadside across the track at the entry to turn one. Other drivers tried to avoid crashing into each other and the stricken Grosjean, however some failed. Vettel, starting from ninth, clipped the front wing of the still moving Lotus but his car was undamaged. He and a number of others took the shortcut behind the apex of the first corner to avoid the mess. Sauber's Kamui Kobayashi, who was right behind Vettel, decided to avoid Grosjean by passing him on the racing line. Before the Lotus finally came to a complete stop it rolled backwards slightly and its right rear tyre clipped the left rear of slow moving Kobayashi sending him into the air, nearly landing on Button's McLaren. At the very back of the field, amidst all the chaos Pastor Maldonado, starting last, braked too late and crashed into the back of de la Rosa's HRT, terminally damaging both his front wing and de la Rosa's rear wing. Maldonado retired later in the lap. In order to permit safe clearance of the debris, the safety car was deployed.\nThe safety car was called in during the second lap after Grosjean and Maldonado's cars had been removed, while Kobayashi and de la Rosa made it back to the pits under their own power. Damage to de la Rosa's car forced his retirement, but following checks the Sauber was able to rejoin the race in 21st place. Schumacher was told by his team that his car seemed fine after the contact with Grosjean and he was able to continue.\nOn the restart nearly all drivers held their positions. Webber led Rosberg and Hamilton in an unchanged top three from the grid. Meanwhile, Kobayashi returned to the pits where he retired due to suspension damaged from the first corner incident with the Lotus. Webber was setting consecutive fastest laps while the stewards investigated various cars cutting the first corner to avoid Grosjean; no further action was taken.\nAfter 13 laps the threat of rain forced teams to not pit stop early so as not to change tyres again if it did eventually rain. Petrov pitted on lap 16 only to retire as he had an electrical problem. As the track temperature dropped both Ferraris, in fourth and fifth, started to pick up pace and set quick lap times.\nBy lap 23 the sole remaining Sauber of Sergio Pérez was the only car making multiple overtaking moves, up to 15th from his 23rd place grid spot. Meanwhile, Schumacher pressured a struggling Kimi Räikkönen as the Lotus driver was told to stay out and wait for predicted rain. Thanks to Räikkönen's pace, a gap formed that allowed Rosberg to pit on lap 27, to switch to the soft compound tyre, and return to the track without any nearby traffic.\nLeaders Webber and Hamilton followed Rosberg's lead and pitted the next lap. Alonso, now in first place, stayed out for another lap during which he set consecutive fastest sectors by nearly a second before following the others and switching to the soft tyre. So quick was Alonso that he came out of the pits well ahead of Hamilton. Massa inherited the lead and pitted on the next lap. This left Vettel, who had not stopped, in the lead with a ten-second advantage over his teammate, Webber. As the race went on Vettel extended his lead over Webber and the rest of the field. Later, in the press conference, both Webber and Rosberg stated that they had struggled to warm their soft compound tyre at that time of the race whereas Vettel already had the tyres at the optimum temperature.\nOn lap 38 Pérez was given a drive-through penalty for a late pit entry that had impeded Räikkönen. The same lap also saw Button, who started on the soft tyre, change for the super-soft compound. In an already poor race for Button, his pit stop allowed the Caterham of Heikki Kovalainen to slip ahead of him as he rejoined.\nThe gap to Vettel had settled to sixteen seconds as he still waited for the forecast rain. Massa got a radio message asking him to close the gap to Hamilton as there was a possibility that Vettel could split the two when he rejoined. Further back there was a significant gap from sixth to seventh, where Schumacher was being followed by Jean-Éric Vergne, who had pitted early, and the two Force Indias. Kovalainen held twelfth place ahead of both Button and Toro Rosso driver Daniel Ricciardo.\nForty-five laps into the race Vettel finally took his only pit stop for the race. As he rejoined, teammate Webber reclaimed the lead while Vettel was able to only marginally get ahead of Hamilton. As the leaders lapped backmarkers, the gap between the top six was less than six seconds. Räikkönen's engineer told him that no rain was now expected.\nBy lap 48 Pérez was 2.7 seconds per lap quicker than the leaders and set a number of fastest laps. Ferrari engineer Rob Smedley was attempting to keep Massa motivated in sixth when he claimed \"keep our tyres fresh cause he doesn't look absolutely fantastic, old Lewis\", referring to Hamilton ahead in fifth.\nSchumacher began to complain of a problem on lap 59 but still continued. However, on lap 61 he let Vergne past him and continued to slow. Spots of rain started to show in some parts of the track but nothing of real concern for the drivers. A few laps later the seven time world champion entered the pits and retired from the race with a fuel pressure problem. In consecutive laps Pic and Ricciardo both retired from the race owing to an electrical fault and a steering problem, respectively.\nWith 10 laps remaining, the first six drivers were split by fewer than four seconds. On lap 69 and Vergne pitted to switch to intermediate tyres; the only driver to do so in the race. Still behind Kovalainen, Button locked up his brakes next to the swimming pool and spun. That left Pérez behind him to attack the Caterham, which Pérez succeeded in passing. Vergne's move to intermediate tyres had not worked, as he was losing over seven seconds every lap to his rivals. Two laps after Button spun, he had caught back up to Kovalainen. Button attempted an overtake on Kovalainen around the outside of turn 1. Button, who was able to brake later in his McLaren, launched down the outside of Kovalainen in the braking zone of turn 1. At the same time Kovalainen moved left and the Finn's front wing hit Button's front right tyre, causing a puncture on the McLaren, and Kovalainen damaged his front wing. A subsequent pit stop for Kovalainen put him down to 13th place, meanwhile Button retired from the race due to his puncture.\nThe gap at the front remained close however; no driver was able to move ahead. In the final few laps rain still threatened, but each of the six leaders held their own as they lapped cars. Hamilton and Massa did drop back slightly from the four towards the end of the race. By the final lap, artificial light from cameras was becoming more prominent as daylight faded with the threat of darker rain clouds. Ultimately, Webber was able to keep Rosberg, Alonso and Vettel at bay for his second career victory at the Monte-Carlo circuit.\nIn winning the Monaco Grand Prix Webber became the only Australian to win on multiple occasions at the circuit. It was Webber's first win of the season and first since his victory at the last race of the 2011 season in Brazil. In taking the victory Webber and the five victorious drivers before him set a new record for six different winners from the first six races of a Formula One season. The margin between the first four drivers was only 1.343 seconds as Rosberg followed Webber into second place and Spaniard Alonso finished in third; his 76th career podium. Red Bull teammate Vettel, using a different strategy to the top three, was fourth while Hamilton was fifth. Massa backed up his best qualifying effort of the season with his best result of the season by finishing sixth and only six seconds from the eventual winner.\nSome forty seconds off the lead was the Force India's led by di Resta, who was on the same strategy as Vettel, and teammate Hülkenberg who (like Webber and Massa) captured his best result of the season thus far. Räikkönen was ninth while Williams driver Senna picked up the final point in tenth. Importantly for the constructors title, Caterham driver Kovalainen finished in thirteenth (his highest so far) moving Caterham up into tenth place ahead of Marussia and HRT on the 2012 standings. This was despite Marussia driver Glock (14th) and HRT driver Karthikeyan (15th) finishing in their respective highest positions for the season.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:"

        "title": "2012 Singapore Grand Prix",
        "text": "The 2012 Singapore Grand Prix (officially the 2012 Formula 1 SingTel Singapore Grand Prix) was a Formula One motor race that took place at the Marina Bay Street Circuit in Marina Bay, Singapore on 23 September 2012 as the fourteenth round of the 2012 season. The race was the thirteenth time that a Singapore Grand Prix has been held, and the fifth time it was a round of the Formula One World Championship.\nLewis Hamilton started the race from pole. Sebastian Vettel won the race, his second of the season, after Hamilton's gearbox failed early in the race.\nReport.\nBackground.\nHaving been unable to race in Italy two weeks earlier because of a one-race ban he received for causing a serious collision in Belgium, Romain Grosjean was back in the driving seat again with Lotus F1 for the race in Singapore.\nLike the 2011 Singapore Grand Prix, tyre supplier Pirelli brought its yellow-banded soft compound tyre as the harder \"prime\" tyre and the red-banded supersoft compound tyre as the softer \"option\" tyre.\nAt Singapore's Marina Bay circuit, Ma Qinghua once again drove Narain Karthikeyan's car in the first free practice session, as he had during free practice at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza,\nFree practice.\nThe first practice session on Friday evening was held in damp conditions. Rain earlier in the day had soaked the circuit, but it had started drying out as the session began. Sebastian Vettel set the fastest time of the session, five hundredths of a second faster than Lewis Hamilton. Although several drivers went off the circuit, they were able to rejoin without damage and the session was uninterrupted. By the time the second session began, the circuit was completely dry. Vettel was once again fastest, this time three-tenths of a second faster than Jenson Button. The session was briefly interrupted when Bruno Senna clipped a barrier coming out from under the grandstand at turn 19 before spinning to a halt at the next corner. Vettel topped the third and final session on Saturday evening, three-tenths faster than Hamilton. The session was cut short two minutes before the chequered flag when Vitaly Petrov hit the wall at Turn 21, breaking his right-rear suspension and as a consequence, his Caterham stopped in the entrance to the pitlane and by doing so, blocked it causing a red flag until the session ended.\nQualifying.\nThe first qualifying period saw several teams caught out by the difference in performance between the harder prime tyres and the softer options, which was estimated to be up to a second and a half per lap. The end result was that several teams had to use up a set of soft tyres to guarantee a place in the second period. Williams' Bruno Senna clipped the wall on his final lap while faced with the threat of elimination, but made it through to the second period by a tenth of a second when Kamui Kobayashi failed to better his lap time. Vitaly Petrov out-qualified teammate Heikki Kovalainen to start nineteenth, putting the Caterhams ahead of Marussia duo of Timo Glock and Charles Pic. HRT once again filled the final row of the grid, with Narain Karthikeyan out-qualifying Pedro de la Rosa for the second race in succession with a time that was almost a second faster than the Spaniard's. De la Rosa started qualifying with the knowledge that he would receive a five-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change regardless of where he started, but as he qualified twenty-fourth and last, the effect of the penalty was negated.\nThe second qualifying period started with Senna and Romain Grosjean crashing. While Grosjean was able to continue after mechanics inspected his car, Senna – who had once again hit the wall at Turn 19, his third such incident at that corner – returned to the pit with terminal damage. With his failure to set a lap time, he was relegated to seventeenth on the grid. At the end of the fifteen-minute session, Nico Hülkenberg was eliminated in eleventh, and later admitted that he felt he could have gone faster in the first sector. Kimi Räikkönen qualified alongside him in twelfth, ahead of Felipe Massa and Sergio Pérez. Scuderia Toro Rosso drivers Daniel Ricciardo and Jean-Éric Vergne had a quiet qualifying session, and ultimately finished fifteenth and sixteenth respectively.\nMercedes elected not to take part in the final period of qualifying, allowing Michael Schumacher and Nico Rosberg to save a set of tyres and giving them the choice of which compound on which to start the race. As a result, only eight drivers took part in the final ten minutes of qualifying. Lewis Hamilton prevailed, taking pole position by half a second from Pastor Maldonado. After being consistently fast through free practice, Sebastian Vettel could only manage third overall, ahead of Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso, the latter admitting that he was not expecting to be fast during the Singapore Grand Prix weekend. Paul di Resta qualified sixth, ahead of Mark Webber, leaving Romain Grosjean as the eighth and final driver to set a time.\nPost-qualifying.\nIn an interview after qualifying, Lewis Hamilton publicly implored Pastor Maldonado to be careful during the start of the race, given the latter's reputation for reckless driving and frequent on-track incidents.\nPre-race.\nA minute of silence was held for Sid Watkins, who died on 12 September 2012. A book of remembrance was also available for people to sign their condolences over the weekend.\nRace.\nHamilton led lap 1 with Maldonado falling to 4th with Vettel and Button overtaking into P2 and P3 respectively.\nOn lap 9, Webber made an early pitstop onto the soft compound tyres, making him drop from 7th to 19th. This created a chain reaction, as his stop was followed by Vettel stopping on lap 11 and Alonso on lap 12. Race leader Lewis Hamilton emerged just ahead of Vettel after his stop on lap 13, after complaining of a \"funny feeling\". His teammate Jenson Button came out behind Vettel after his stop on lap 14.\nOn lap 23, Hamilton's gearbox failed forcing him to retire allowing Vettel to take P1 which continued until the end of the race. It was noted to be the 2nd mechanical retirement for the Briton.\nOn lap 30, Karthikeyan crashed at turn 18 causing yellow flags and a safety car to be deployed. Maldonado retired with hydraulic issues before the safety car came in. He had a call 1 lap before he came to the pits and retired. 2 laps later, Schumacher and Vergne collided, with Schumacher failing to brake properly, and consequently crashing into the back of Vergne's Toro Rosso, resulting in their retirement. After the crash, Michael Schumacher climbed out of his car and went over to apologise to Vergne, this brought out the safety car for the second time in the race, it came in at the start of Lap 42 and racing resumed. Vettel went on to win the race and he dedicated his victory to Sid Watkins who had recently died.\nPaul di Resta managed to keep Mercedes driver Nico Rosberg at bay to claim his career-best finish of P4, gaining him two places in the Drivers' Championship to stand 11th. the race finished two laps early as the two-hour limit was reached, the first time this had happened since the 2008 Monaco Grand Prix.\nPost-race.\nThe top three drivers appeared on the podium to collect their trophies and spoke to the media at a later press conference. Red Bull team mechanic Ole Schack appeared on the podium to receive the winning manufacturer's award.\nAfter the race, the stewards gave Michael Schumacher a ten-place grid penalty at the next race, Suzuka, after he crashed into Jean-Eric Vergne and caused them both to retire. This penalty was applied in accordance with article 16.1 of the FIA Formula One Sporting Regulations. Mark Webber was also demoted by a place, losing the 10th place and the point to finish 11th, due to a move deemed by the FIA to be advantageous as it resulted in an unfair advantage.\nClassification.\nQualifying.\nNotes:\nRace.\nNotes:"

        "title": "Ham and Petersham Cricket Club",
        "text": "Ham and Petersham Cricket Club was established in 1815. In 2015 the cricket club celebrated its bicentenary.\nFoundation.\nCricket was originally played on Ham Common by the Albion Club in 1815. During the 19th century the Albion Club became known as Ham Albion. By 1891 the club was referred to as Ham and Petersham Cricket Club and this name has been retained up until the present day.\nLocation.\nThe home ground, Ham Common, is located in Ham which borders the village of Petersham. It is surrounded by some notable houses, the edge of Richmond Park, Cassel Hospital and two pubs, The Hand and Flower and The New Inn. At one end of the ground is a pond; legend has it that the only player ever to hit the ball in the pond, a distance of 170m, was Gary Sobers.\nThe clubhouse.\nUp until the Second World War a tent was set up for the players to change in. Caricatures of Jack Hobbs and Fred Burgess (the first XI captain in 1913) were drawn on the side of the tent. In 1927 a clubhouse was erected on Ham Common but the club was soon forced to take it down by Ham Urban District Council as it is common land. In 1968 the committee raised funds to build a clubhouse adjacent to the Hand and Flower pub. In 2013, after another fundraising effort, a new clubhouse was built and was opened by England and Surrey cricketer Alec Stewart on 17 April 2013.\nFamous players.\nSome famous cricketers have graced the field on Ham Common, including Shane Warne, Imran Khan, Gary Sobers, Tom Richardson, Jack Hobbs, Andy Sandham, Herbert Strudwick, Peter May, Alec Bedser and Bill Brockwell. Celebrity players have included Michael Parkinson, Roy Castle, Tim Theakston of Theakston Brewery and Tim Rice.\nGreat club players.\nBill Brockwell, who played for England and Surrey in the 19th century, was probably the finest cricketer to regularly play for the club. He lived at Rajinda Cottage on Ham Common and was the vice-president of the club prior to World War I.\nThe best player of the 20th century was Richard Harrison, a quick bowler who batted at number 4. Harrison retired from cricket in 1999.\nScore books.\nThe earliest surviving scorecard dates back to a match between Ham Albion and Twickenham Cricket Club that took place on Tuesday 13 July 1841. Ham Albion won by an innings and 87 runs. A scorecard from a match played against Brentford Cricket Club in 1855 also exists. The local newspaper, \"The Surrey Comet\", recorded at the time that \"at the conclusion of the game the players partook of an excellent supper at The New Inn, which was supplied by Mr Adam Goddard in his usual style and reflected credit on the worthy host\".\nScore book archive.\nHam and Petersham Cricket Club Archive – 1978 to 1985\nHam and Petersham Cricket Club Archive – 1986 to 2009\nClassic matches.\nMackie's 9 and Claridge's 8.\nOn 30 May 1982 J Mackie took 9 for 26 as Thames Ditton Old Boys achieved a total of 62. In reply Ham and Petersham could only manage 33, with J Mackie top scoring with 15 not out. The very next match, against Chertsey, J Mackie did not play. Ham and Petersham scored 198 and bowled Chertsey out for 14 with P Claridge taking 8 for 6.\nClarkie's Hundred.\nOn 15 July 1984 the club's Chairman and opening batsman, Peter Clarke, scored a 100 not out. He would score over 500 runs that season.\nBobby Jordan 's debut.\nOn 25 August 1985 Bobby Jordan made his debut for Ham and Petersham. With line and length swing bowling he took 7 wickets for 45 runs. On 3 September 2017, 32 years later, having been Chairman of Ham and Petersham for over a decade, Jordan played his last match, still bowling line and length swing and still taking wickets.\nYorkshire tour.\nIn May 1979 the club went on its first tour to Yorkshire. This was arranged through former players and Yorkshire residents, Andrew Dallas and Tim Theakston. The Yorkshire Tour match was played against Theakston Brewery. In the 20 overs a side match Theakston Brewery 141 for 3 beat Ham and Petersham 95 all out In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic the club held a virtual Yorkshire Tour, complete with a virtual cricket match and virtual pub crawl. The tour continued every year up until 2022. .\nBicentennial year.\nThe 2015 saw the club celebrate its 200th year. The anniversary was marked by six special celebrations.\nLeague Cricket.\nSince the early 2000s, Ham and Petersham Cricket Club has played in the Surrey Cricket League. In 2017 Ham and Petersham Cricket Club switched to the Fuller's Brewery Surrey County League."

Originally announced on August 4, 2010 by Colorado Governor Bill Ritter and Lance Armstrong as the Quiznos Pro Challenge, the event carried on the state's cycling legacy, which was most notably highlighted by the Coors Classic that ran from 1980 to 1988. On February 4, 2011 Richard E. Schaden, former owner of Quiznos and the event's co-chairman, announced the investment of an initial $10 million to secure the initial growth and longevity of the race. The USA Pro Cycling Challenge was one of only three current 2.HC rated races in the United States (along with the Tour of California, and the Tour of Utah), and was considered one of the most important pro cycling races in the U.S.\nAfter the 2015 edition, Schaden was unable to find a title sponsor for the 2016 edition, and subsequently left as an investor. The organizers were hoping to find a new investor to bring the race back for a 2017 edition, but the race folded after the 2015 edition.\nHistory.\n2011 edition.\nIn 2011, the event took place between August 22–28, 2011 and featured 16 professional cycling teams consisting of 135 riders; including the top three riders of the 2011 Tour de France: Cadel Evans, Andy Schleck and Fränk Schleck. Riders traveled 518 miles and climbed 36,250 total feet at altitudes of upwards of 12,000 feet during the seven days of competition.\nThe race received 25 hours of national television airtime on Versus and the NBC Sports Network and was seen by over one million people worldwide. On-air commentary was provided by Tour de France announcers Paul Sherwen, Phil Liggett and Bob Roll.\nAmericans swept the podium, with Levi Leipheimer winning the race, Christian Vande Velde finishing second, and Tejay van Garderen finishing third.\n2012 edition.\nFor 2012, the 683-mile race featured 42,000 feet of climbing, nine mountain passes (three of which exceed 12,000 feet), and three mountain top finishes.

The race was held from August 20–26 and featured an Individual Time Trial on the final day of racing in Denver. The race has received a 2.HC from the UCI (French: Hors categorie; English: beyond categorization), the highest rating for a continental tour stage race.\nSimilar to the first edition, Americans swept the podium, with Christian Vande Velde winning the race, Tejay van Garderen finishing second, and Levi Leipheimer finishing third.\n2013 edition.\nThe race took place from August 19–25, 2013. It began in Aspen, wound its way through the Rocky Mountains at heights of up to , and finished in the streets of downtown Denver.\nAmerican Tejay van Garderen of won the overall title after finishing lower on the podium the previous two years.

        "title": "Harvard Boxing Club",
        "text": "The Harvard Boxing Club is a student organization at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nBoxing has been a popular campus activity since the mid 19th century. It was first documented by Boston newspapers citing Harvard students attending Professor Paton Stewart Jr. \"Boston Gymnasium\" on Tremont Street in Boston, and later attending Mr. Stewart's \"Harvard Gymnasium\" on Palmer Street in Cambridge.\nWith the opening of the first official Harvard Gymnasium in 1859, Professor Aaron Molyneaux Hewlett was hired as the first physical exercises instructor and gymnasium superintendent. Hewlett brought his own system that included a mix of English and German gymnastics, Indian Clubs, weights, medicine balls and Boxing. Sparring fees with Professor Hewlett were $8 per year in 1859. The first documented Harvard Boxing photographs were captured by George Kendall Warren in 1860.\nIn 1871 after Hewlett’s passing, sparring master John B. Bailey became the boxing instructor, and Frederick W. Lister the superintendent at the College gymnasium until 1878.\nAthletics gained momentum at Harvard and in 1878 a larger facility was open as the Hemenway Gymnasium ran by Dudley Allen Sargent. In the intramural tournament of 1879, future President Theodore Roosevelt faced C.S. Hanks in the lightweight championship and lost, after a controversial late hit by Hanks. According to historian Edmund Morris, the crowd started booing Hanks, prompting Roosevelt to put up his hands and shout “It's alright, he didn’t hear [the bell]”. When Roosevelt campaigned for the Presidency, his supporters would frequently recall this anecdote as an early example of his extraordinary character.\nBoxing became an official varsity sport in 1922, per recommendation of the Harvard Athletic Committee, and Harvard boxers performed well against their Ivy League opponents (amassing a 25:11:4 record from 1930 to 1937). The team expanded during World War II, when all undergraduates were required to participate in intercollegiate boxing training as a way of improving wartime fitness.\nIn 1961, the NCAA decided to discontinue boxing as an intercollegiate sport and the Harvard Boxing Team was replaced by the Harvard Boxing Club. Intramural tournaments continued until 1976 when Harvard banned them due to riotous crowd attendance, leaving the Harvard Boxing Club (in its current form) as the last remnant of the college’s proud boxing tradition.\nNotable coaches include Tommy Rawson, national amateur junior lightweight champion in 1929, who coached boxers such as Rocky Marciano, and coached at Harvard for 60 years from 1941-2001.\nToday.\nThe Harvard Boxing Club currently includes several dozen members, many of whom participate in the annual Harvard Boxing Club Exhibition Night (a tradition that was revived in 2009). The Club is now co-ed (since the merging of Harvard and Radcliffe College) and includes both undergraduates and graduates.\nThe Harvard Boxing Club is managed by one undergraduate President and four undergraduate Captains supported by graduate and alumni advisors. The Harvard Boxing Club is coached by former title-holding amateur fighter, Joe Lake, who assumed the position in 2024 after naming his predecessor, Doug Yoffe, Coach Emeritus, who assumed the position in 2001. Yoffe replaced Tommy Rawson—former national amateur lightweight champion (with a 223-4 amateur record), former chairman of the Massachusetts Boxing Commission, and one-time trainer of boxing legend Rocky Marciano. Rawson had been “Coach” since 1941.\nThe Club practices two hours per day, six days per week. Skill days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) are typically led by the Coach, while conditioning days (Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday) are typically led by the Captains."

        "text": "George Henry Small (July 31, 1953 – March 3, 2010) was an American first baseman in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Atlanta Braves during the season. Listed at , 205 lb., Small batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Atlanta, Georgia.\nCollege career.\nSmall attended University of South Carolina, where he hit 48 career home runs from 1972 through 1975 to set a USC record that stood until 2008.\nIn 1972 Small hit for a .379 batting average with four home runs as a freshman, then slumped to .282 with eight homers as a sophomore in 1973. After aluminium bats were allowed in 1974, he raised his average to .360 and belted a USC record 17 home runs in his junior season, garnering a second-team All-American selection.\nIn April 1974, USC hosted an exhibition game at Sarge Frye Field between the New York Yankees and New York Mets. Prior to the game, a home run hitting contest included Thurman Munson of the Yankees, Duffy Dyer of the Mets and Small, who won with a decisive home run over the left field fence.\nThen, as a senior in 1975, Small batted .390 and broke his record with 19 home runs. Besides Small, the USC team featured future major league players as Garry Hancock, Greg Keatley, Ed Lynch and Jim Pankovits. USC finished second at the College World Series that year, and he earned first-team All-America honors. USC lost the championship game to University of Texas, 5–1, with Small's homer accounting for the only run.\nProfessional career.\nSmall was selected in the fourth round of the 1975 Major League Baseball Draft by the Atlanta Braves. He was assigned to Class-A Greenwood Braves but advanced quickly through the minor league system, gaining promotions to Double-A Savannah (1976-'77) and Triple-A Richmond (1977-'78). In 1978 he led the International League with 25 home runs and 101 runs batted in, while hitting a .289 average and making the All-Star team. He earned a late-season call-up to the majors and played in one game for Atlanta on September 27. He went hitless in four at-bats in his only big-league game.\nSmall hit .220 with six home runs and 35 RBI for Rochester in 1979, his last professional season. In five minor league seasons, he posted a collective average of .267 (480-for-1954) in 514 games, including 53 homers and 237 RBI while scoring 170 times.\nFollowing his baseball career, Small worked in the insurance industry for a long time and later worked for a groundskeeping company that maintained baseball diamonds.\nSmall died at age 56 as a result of a fall, while moving into his new home in Griffin, Georgia.\nUSC honors.\nSmall was inducted into the University of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame in 1991. His name still sits in the record books in several categories among the top 10 career leaders in USC history. He ranks second in the all-time list in home runs (48), fifth in runs batted (184), sixth in total bases (433), eight in slugging percentage (.626), ninth in hits (245), and tenth in batting average (.354) and for singles (156).\nPersonal life.\nSmall married college sweetheart, Margaret Fowler and they had two children, Caroline Lindsey Small and Chelsea Rebecca Small."

        "title": "Asia Rugby Women's Sevens Series",
        "text": "The Asia Rugby Women's Sevens Series is the regional championship for women's international rugby sevens in Asia. Initially contested as a single tournament, the championship was expanded into a two-tournament series in 2014. The competition is sanctioned and sponsored by Asia Rugby, which is the rugby union governing body for the region.\nThe first official regional 7s championship for international women's teams from Asia was held in Hong Kong, played as part of the 2000 Hong Kong Sevens tournament. In 2003, ten international teams competed in a separate tournament for the Asia Champions Cup, with six teams progressing to the Hong Kong Women's Sevens. Since then, the regional 7s championships have periodically served as pre-qualifying competitions for the Rugby 7s World Cup, or other sevens tournaments.\nBackground.\nRugby sevens – also known as 7-a-side, or 7s – is a short form of the sport of rugby union that was first played in 1883. The first (men's) internationals took place in 1973. As women's rugby union developed in the 1960s and 1970s the format became very popular as it allowed games, and entire leagues, to be developed in countries even when player numbers were small, and it remains the main form the women's game is played in most parts of the world.\nHowever, although the first women's international rugby union 15-a-side test match took place in 1982, it was not until 1997 before the first women's international 7s tournaments were played, when the 1997 Hong Kong Sevens included a women's tournament for the first time. Over the next decade the number of tournaments grew, with almost every region developing regular championship competitions. This reached its zenith with 2009's inaugural women's tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens, shortly followed by the announcement that women's rugby sevens would be included in the Olympics from 2016.\nTournaments.\nAsia Rugby Women's Sevens Series.\nTournaments that have featured as ranking events in the Asia Rugby Women's Sevens include:\nThe continental title was contested in a single tournament from 2000 to 2012 (). The Asian Women's Sevens Series was introduced in 2013.\nNotes:\n A separate Olympic Asian qualification series was held in 2015 with a pre-qualifying stage hosted in Chennai and final stages in Hong Kong and Tokyo.\n The 2017 Asian Women's Trophy tournament was held in Vientiane, Laos\n The 2020 series was cancelled before any events were held, due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n Incheon, Huizhou and Colombo were originally scheduled as legs of the 2021 series. Due to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, all three of those events were cancelled and replaced – initially by two events planned for Dubai, but eventually by just one event in Dubai.\nChampions.\nWinners of the Asian Women's Sevens Championship:\nNotes:\n2007 South East Asia Sevens.\nThe 2007 South East Asia Sevens was held on 6 October 2007 in Singapore.\nClassification Stage.\nBowl Final\nPlate Final\nCup Final"

        "text": "This is a recap of the 2010–11 season for the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) Tour. It was the Tour's 52nd season and consisted of 12 title events.\nTournament schedule and recaps.\nFor the second season in a row, the PBA condensed the first half of the season into the PBA World Series of Bowling (WSOB). Preliminary rounds of the televised tournaments were held in October and November, with television tapings on November 5–6. All of the events were held at the South Point Casino's bowling center in Las Vegas, NV. South Point also hosted the live multi-day final for the PBA World Championship on January 14–16, 2011.\nThe World Series was open to all PBA, Korean Professional Bowlers Association, Japan Professional Bowlers Association, and World Ten-Pin Bowling Association members (except for USA-based WTBA members, who must also join the PBA).\nThe format for the first of the PBA's four majors, the PBA World Championship, overlapped with the five \"oil pattern\" championships of the World Series. Each of the five oil pattern championships (Cheetah, Viper, Chameleon, Scorpion, Shark) were both standalone title tournaments and part of the qualifying round for the 2010–11 PBA World Championship. Each oil pattern championship opened with a 12-game qualifying round, and proceeded to its own 16-bowler match play semifinal and five-bowler televised final round. In addition, scores from the 60 total games of oil pattern tournament qualifying were combined to create the eight-bowler final field for the PBA World Championship. The PBA also used the 60-game scores to create a made-for-television exhibition event, U.S.A. vs. the World, taped on November 6 and aired on January 9, 2011. The event featured the top 6 USA qualifiers against the top 6 international qualifiers.\nThe PBA, for the first time, scheduled three consecutive days of live broadcasts for the PBA World Championship finals, January 14–16, 2011. The format was an 8-bowler stepladder. The 8–7 and 7–6 matches aired Friday night, January 14 on ESPN2; the 6–5 and 5–4 matches aired Saturday night, January 15 on ESPN2; the top four then competed Sunday afternoon, January 16 on ESPN.\nThe 2011 PBA Tournament of Champions featured an all-new format and a $250,000 first prize, making it the richest PBA tournament in history. The event also marked the return of a PBA tournament to ABC-TV, where the PBA Tour aired from 1962 to 1997.\nThe 2011 Lumber Liquidators U.S. Open also featured live Friday and Saturday night broadcasts on ESPN2, this time covering the match-play rounds on February 25–26. The 4-person stepladder finals aired live Sunday, February 27 on ESPN.\nFor the first time in PBA history, the season concluded with a playoff. The qualifying rounds of the Dick Weber PBA Playoffs ran March 8–13, and featured 18 regional qualifiers in each PBA Region (East, Central, South, Southwest, Midwest, combined West/Northwest) plus 72 \"seeded\" regular touring pros randomly placed in each of the six regions. Two \"knockout\" rounds (three region finals each) and the \"conference finals\" were broadcast on a tape-delay basis for three straight Sundays, starting March 27, 2011. The finals, featuring the three conference final winners, were broadcast live on Sunday, April 17.\nSchedule with results.\nBelow is a summary of the 2010–11 season. Total career PBA Tour titles for winners are shown in parentheses.\n2010–11 PBA Tour Trials.\nThe seven bowlers who join the PBA's exempt bowler field for the 2010–11 season via the Regional Players Invitational tournament (which replaced the Tour Trials in 2010) are as follows:\nThese players join the bowlers who either (1) won a 2009–10 PBA Tour title, (2) earned a multi-year exemption by winning a major title, (3) earned an exemption via 2009–10 points list or (4) were awarded an injury deferment from the 2009–10 season. The total exempt field is 52 bowlers, with one more to be added via the PBA's \"Golden Parachute\" rule."

He played college football at Texas A&amp;I as a linebacker and played for the San Antonio Gunslingers of the United States Football League (USFL) in the mid-1980s. Castillo then coached high school and college football before joining the Eagles in 1995 as an offensive assistant. He has served as both a coach for tight ends and offensive line.\nCollege career.\nCastillo earned a scholarship worth $500 to attend Texas A&amp;I after spending a semester at the Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education. He played college football while enrolled.\nProfessional career.\nCastillo played for the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL from 1984–1985, mainly on special teams. In 1984, Castillo saw action in six games, making four tackles and three assists. In 1985, Castillo played in seven games, making eight tackles and registering three assists on a 5–13 club.\nCoaching career.\nH.M. King High School.\nCastillo coached linebackers and was the defensive line coach at Henrietta M. King High School from 1986 to 1989.\nTexas A&amp;M University–Kingsville.\nCastillo was the defensive line coach for Texas A&amp;M University–Kingsville from 1982 to 1985 and from 1990 to 1994 he was the offensive line coach. Four offensive linemen he coached ended up in the NFL: Jermane Mayberry, Jorge Diaz, Kevin Dogins, and Earl Dotson.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles hired Castillo as an offensive assistant in 1995 under Ray Rhodes. In 1996, the Eagles drafted Jermane Mayberry, an offensive lineman Castillo coached at Texas A&amp;M University–Kingsville, in the first round of the 1996 NFL draft. Castillo was promoted to tight ends coach in 1997, and switched to coaching the offensive line in 1998. When Andy Reid was hired as the head coach of the Eagles in 1999, he retained Castillo on the coaching staff. Mayberry earned a Pro Bowl berth in 2002, and said Castillo \"molded me into the player I became.\" Castillo coached the offensive line for thirteen seasons, from 1998 to 2010.\nCastillo became the defensive coordinator for the Eagles following the firing of Sean McDermott on February 2, 2011. The hiring was met with surprise by players, fans, and members of the media primarily because Castillo had not coached the defensive side of the ball since he was at Kingsville in 1989. Castillo was fired on October 16, 2012. \nBaltimore Ravens.\nOn January 21, 2013, Castillo was hired as a consultant by the Baltimore Ravens.

He served two seasons with the Bills before being dismissed following the 2018 season.\nMichigan.\nCastillo joined the Michigan Wolverines coaching staff as an offensive analyst for the 2019 season. As part of his duties, Castillo worked with Michigan offensive line coach Ed Warinner.\nChicago Bears.\nCastillo was hired by the Chicago Bears as offensive line coach on January 5, 2020.

        "title": "William Campbell (rugby union)",
        "text": "William Alexander Campbell (born 28 November 1961) is a retired international rugby union player who played 26 test matches and vice-captained for 15 for the Australian Wallabies in the position of lock from 1984 until 1990. He played 58 matches and captained 26 times (21 wins and five losses) for the Queensland Reds. Peter Jenkins named Campbell as one of the top 100 Wallabies in his book of the same name. Campbell ended his rugby career at 29 to further his medical studies and focus on his growing family.\nCareer.\nAfter touring the United Kingdom with Australian Universities in 1984, William Campbell made his debut upon his return for both the Queensland Reds and Australian Wallabies. Campbell's debut for Queensland was the start of the 'tall-timber era', according to Ian Diehm in Red, Red, Red when the state side had a number of tall back row forwards. At 202 cm and weighing in at 118 kilograms, Campbell had a gift making him an impressive athlete. Following his impressive performances for Queensland, Campbell was selected to make his international debut against Fiji in Suva the same year as a member of the 1984 Grand Slam Wallaby touring side. The Wallabies won the match 16 to 3. Campbell did not join the Wallabies again until 1986 when he played against Italy in Ballymore. He then went on to play against France and Argentina for both Queensland and the Wallabies in the same season. The tour by Argentina was only the second visit to Australia by the Pumas since 1983 and once again the athletic and tall Campbell stamped his authority on the line-outs in all of these matches.\nDuring the same year, coach Alan Jones took the Wallabies into the Bledisloe Cup series following his mantra \"KISS\" – Keep It Simple Stupid. The Wallabies won the first Test match 13 to 12, the All Blacks won the second Test Match 13 to 12, with the Wallabies coming out on top after the third Test match, winning 22 to 9. This marked the first time the Australian Wallabies won the Bledisloe Cup on Kiwi soil since 1949. The coach presented an inscribed photograph of Campbell, reaching for the ball in a line-out, thanking him for playing 'such a big role in our Bledisloe Cup victory'.\nIn 1987 Campbell was vice-captain of the Wallabies against South Korea, England, the US, and Japan. the Wallabies won all their pool matches and progressed to the quarter-finals against Ireland at Waratah Stadium on 7 June. The teaming of Campbell and Cutler once again achieved complete dominance at the line-outs and the pair were described as line-out gurus by Maxwell Howell. After winning the first three line-outs against France in the semi-final, Campbell was sent off after suffering ligament damage. Australia lost to France 30 to 24.\nIn 1989, the British Lions toured Australia and Campbell was selected as captain of the Queensland side and vice-captain of the Wallabies. He played all three Tests against the Lions but the visitors took the series 2–1.\nMr William Campbell, the Wallabies vice-captain, retired in early 1991 to concentrate on his medical studies. Despite the lure of revenge he chose not to be a member of the 1991 Wallabies who would eventually hoist the William Webb Ellis trophy for the first time following victory of England at Twickenham. Instead, Campbell sat his surgical primary the day after the Wallabies won the World Cup, determined to pass.\nPersonal life.\nWilliam Campbell was born at the Mater hospital, Brisbane on 28 November 1961 to parents Noela and William Snr Campbell. He was the 5th of 8 children. He attended Villa Nova College in his early school years and then moved to Gregory Terrace, where he progressed through age group rugby. After Terrace, Campbell studied medicine at Queensland University aiming at a profession of Vascular Surgeon where he attained Fellowship of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons in general surgery and vascular surgery.\nIn 1980 at the age of 19, Campbell married his childhood sweetheart Lynne Irwin in Brisbane. Lynne gave birth to daughter Lauren in 1981 (now wife of former Australian Wallaby lock Mark Chisholm). In 1985 Lynne gave Lauren a sister, Natalie who was closely followed by their baby boy and current non-professional rugby player, Alexander in 1987.\nStraight after the 1987 World Cup, Campbell headed to England with his young family on a one-year Kobe Steel scholarship at St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he played with The Oxford XV.\nIn early 1991, with Australia gearing up for what would prove to be a successful quest to raise the Webb Ellis trophy for the first time, the Wallabies' vice-captain quit at the age of 29 to focus on his family and medical studies. From 1993 to 1995, while still studying the fine form of vascular surgery, Campbell worked in the less advantaged areas of Nambour and Cairns to help increase the quality of available medical needs. During this time, Lynne gave birth to his fourth child, daughter Madeleine in 1993.\nHis dedication to his work saw him posted to Melbourne in 1998 where he worked for the Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Alfred Hospital and the Epworth. In 2009 he became one of the first Vascular surgeons in Australia to use less invasive surgical procedures such as (UGS) ultrasound guided sclerotherapy and endovenous laser ablation of varicose veins. He now owns 2 private practices with his wife in Melbourne, one at The Epworth Centre and another at Como Private Hospital."

        "text": "Phil Costa (born July 11, 1987) is former American football center in the National Football League (NFL) for the Dallas Cowboys. He played college football at the University of Maryland.\nEarly years.\nCosta attended Holy Cross High School. He was a starting left guard, who played in every game during his three seasons on the team. \nHe was a three-time All-County and two-time All-parochial selection. He received a first-team All-South New Jersey, All-East region and second-team All-state honors as a senior. \nCollege career.\nCosta accepted a football scholarship from the University of Maryland. As a sophomore, he appeared in all 13 games with six starts (5 at left guard and one at right guard). \nAs a junior, he appeared in all 13 games, starting the final 12 contests at right guard. He contributed to running back Da'Rel Scott becoming the seventh player in school history to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season and Chris Turner (American football) to pass for the seventh-highest single-season mark in school history (2,516 yards).\nAs a senior, he was switched to center to replace the recently graduated Edwin Williams and started all 12 games.\nProfessional career.\nDallas Cowboys.\nCosta was signed by the Dallas Cowboys as an undrafted free agent after the 2010 NFL Draft. He began as the fourth-string center, with five-time Pro Bowler Andre Gurode, Kyle Kosier and Travis Bright ahead of him, but when Kosier got hurt and Bright struggled, Costa became the primary backup. He impressed the coaching staff and made the opening day 53-man roster. As a rookie, he earned his first career start at left guard in place of the injured Kosier and Montrae Holland, in the seventh game of the season against the Jacksonville Jaguars.\nIn 2011, he performed well during training camp and preseason, before suffering a strained right posterior cruciate ligament on August 24. After contract restructuring negotiations fell through, Gurode was cut before the fourth preseason game and Costa became the starting center for the year. Because of his small size for the position, as the season wore on, he was exposed and struggled in his blocking assignments against bigger defenders.\nIn 2012, the Cowboys signed free agents guards Mackenzy Bernadeau and Nate Livings to help protect Costa against stronger defensive fronts. Ryan Cook replaced him in the season opener after one series, because he was limited by a back injury he carried from training camp. He returned to play against the Baltimore Ravens and arguably had his best game as a professional, with the Ravens yielding a franchise record 227 rushing yards. In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, he suffered a dislocated ankle and was eventually placed on the injured reserve list on December 5, after playing only six quarters in the season.\nLooking to improve the center position, the Cowboys selected Travis Frederick in the first round of the 2013 NFL Draft and moved Costa to a backup role during training camp. He was eventually waived in a salary cap move on March 7, 2014.\nIndianapolis Colts.\nOn March 13, 2014, Costa signed a two-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts. He retired at the age of 26 on April 21."

        "title": "Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal",
        "text": "The Pakistan cricket spot-fixing scandal was a sports scandal that occurred during a Test match between England and Pakistan at Lord's, London, in August 2010. The scandal centered on three members of Pakistan's national cricket team, who were convicted of taking bribes from a bookmaker, Mazhar Majeed, to deliberately bowl no-balls at certain pre-arranged moments during the Test.\nUndercover reporters from \"News of the World\" secretly videotaped Mazhar Majeed accepting money and informing the reporters that Pakistani fast bowlers Asif and Amir would deliberately bowl no-balls at specific points during the game. This information could be used by gamblers to place bets with inside information (i.e. spot-fixing).\nIn response to these allegations, Scotland Yard arrested Majeed on a charge of match fixing. The International Cricket Council (ICC) banned three Pakistan players - team captain Salman Butt, and the fast bowlers Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir — for terms of between 5 and 10 years. In November 2011, Butt and Asif were also found guilty by a London court on criminal charges relating to spot-fixing. Amir and Majeed had entered guilty pleas on the same charges. All four were given prison sentences, ranging from six months to 32 months.\nContext and History.\nIn May 2010, Shahid Afridi was appointed captain of Pakistan for the series against Australia. After Pakistan lost the first Test against Australia, Afridi announced his resignation as captain. This led to Butt being appointed as Test captain.\nWhile in July 2010, the ICC Anti Corruption and Security Unit served notices to two unnamed players seeking information into allegations of spot and match fixing. These notices were sent out to the players following England's first 2010 Test Match against Pakistan, at Nottingham. The notices informed the players that the ACSU was seeking certain information and gave the pair 14 days to respond.\nSting operation.\nIn August 2010, reporters from \"News of the World\" established contact with Mazhar Majeed, a sports agent who was suspected of involvement in match-fixing. In the video posted by \"News of the World\", Majeed, counting out the bribe money, predicted that Amir would be bowling the third over in the fourth test at Lord's, and that the first ball of the over would be a no-ball delivery. Amir did bowl the third over, and on his first delivery from the over, bowled a no-ball delivery. Commentary described the delivery as an \"enormous no-ball, good half a metre over the line\". Majeed also predicted that the sixth delivery of the tenth over would be a no-ball, and that ball, delivered by Asif, was also a no-ball delivery.\nYawar Saeed, the Pakistan team manager, declined to call for the resignation of team captain Salman Butt, implicated in the scandal. PCB president Ijaz Butt maintained that the players were innocent. At the same time, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif suggested that the spot-fixing controversy might be a set-up and that the leaked video contained a certain number of ambiguities. Iqbal Mohammad Ali, a member of the National Assembly of Pakistan and chairman of the standing committee on sports, called for the removal of the players in question from the team.\nProfessional bans.\nSalman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were each named in the \"News of the World\" investigation. All three players maintained their innocence of the charges levelled against them, but were suspended from playing pending an investigation by the International Cricket Council, which determined that they \"had an arguable case to answer\", on 4 September 2010.\nWajid Shamsul Hasan, the Pakistani High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, claimed that the players had been \"set up\" and were innocent of the charges. He condemned the ICC decision.\nButt subsequently filed an appeal to have his suspension lifted. Asif and Amir followed suit and the ICC announced that a hearing would be held in Qatar on 30 and 31 October. The interior ministry announced that the passports of the three cricketers had been given back to them so that they could travel to Qatar. Seven days before the appeal began Mohammad Asif announced that he had withdrawn his appeal because he wanted to understand the charges against him. Butt and Amir announced that their appeals were to continue. The ICC moved the hearing to the UAE. Salman Butt announced that he hoped the appeals would be completed quickly so that he could make a swift return to international cricket and participate in the series against South Africa in October 2010. Their initial appeal against the suspension was rejected on 31 October 2010. Butt and Amir hit out at the ICC saying that, although the ruling went against them, they weren't informed of the reasons for the decision.\nA tribunal to decide the fates of the players was held in January 2011 The panel comprised Michael Beloff, Albie Sachs and Sharad Rao – all with previous experience in sporting trials. Butt and Amir objected to the selection of Beloff, contending that, as the head of the ICC disciplinary committee, he had a conflict of interest in favour of the ICC over the three cricketers. This was shown, they claimed, when he voted against lifting their suspensions. Butt's lawyer, Aftab Gul, withdrew from the case because he doubted his client would receive justice. The ICC also said that because the story was broken by \"News of the World\", its reporters would feature in the case. A decision was deferred to 5 February 2011.\nOn 5 February 2011, it was announced that the ICC had banned all three players—Butt for ten years, of which five were suspended, Asif for seven years, of which two were suspended, and Amir for five years. The suspension of sentences for Butt and Asif were conditional on each \"[committing] no further breach of the code and...[participating] under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board in a programme of anti-corruption education\". All three players were allowed to file an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport.\nIn response to the announcement, \"The Independent\" said that \"the game was at last standing up to its responsibilities,\" while \"The Guardian\" claimed that \"the urgency to deliver a fierce deterrent to players everywhere has outweighed the need to make the punishment fit the crime.\"\nCriminal investigation.\nAs a result of the newspaper report, Scotland Yard announced the same day that they had arrested Majeed on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers. Two days later, after the Test match had been completed, three more arrests were made (two unidentified men and an unidentified woman) on suspicion of money laundering in connection with the allegations. Police also seized the cell phones of Asif, Amir, and Salman Butt as part of their investigations. Scotland Yard announced on 17 September 2010 that the initial file of the investigation had been passed on to the Crown Prosecution Service for them to decide whether to charge the players or not. On 5 November 2010 Scotland Yard announced that they had passed on the second file of fixing evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service. This moved the case one step closer to the courts.\nOn 1 November 2011, at Southwark Crown Court, Majeed, Asif, Amir and Butt were found guilty of conspiracy to cheat at gambling and conspiracy to accept corrupt payments. Majeed and Amir were convicted following guilty pleas. The judge, Jeremy Cooke, rejected a plea in mitigation from Amir that he had been involved in spot-fixing on only one occasion, on the grounds that the contents of text messages submitted as evidence suggested otherwise.\nThe convictions were broadly accepted and welcomed within the world of cricket. Former Pakistan captain Aamer Sohail spoke of a \"shameful\" day for Pakistani cricket, adding \"this is what happens when you don't react quickly enough to fight corruption\". Former Pakistan Cricket Board chair Khalid Mehmood described the case as \"an example for cricket in the future\".\nOn 3 November 2011, jail terms were handed down of 2 years 6 months for Butt, 1 year for Asif, 6 months for Amir and 2 years 8 months for Majeed.\nReactions.\nThen-Australia captain Ricky Ponting expressed concern over the addition of an Australian victory against Pakistan to a list of more than 80 previous matches under investigation. The match was scrutinized but was soon cleared due to lack of evidence. Australia won the match, despite a large first-innings deficit.\nFootball.\nCroydon Athletic F.C..\nCroydon Athletic F.C. was bought in 2008 by Mazhar Majeed. The football club was investigated by HM Revenues and Customs due to allegations that Majeed had been using the club for money-laundering purposes. Majeed had been recorded by an undercover journalist stating that was the only reason he had bought the club. This led to the manager and his assistant leaving the club after a match on 4 September 2010. Less than a month later on 2 October, the club's chairman David Le Cluse was found dead in a garage in Sutton with a bullet wound to his head. In February 2011, a verdict of suicide was recorded at Croydon Coroner's Court.\nOther investigations.\nAfter the spot-fixing scandal emerged Pakistan registered a victory against England in the third ODI and the ICC announced the match was under investigation due to suspicious behaviour. The ICC carried out a thorough investigation and the Pakistani team and players were given the all-clear to continue playing. Speculation about fixing in the third-ODI ended as the investigation closed.\n2010 ICC World Twenty20.\nThe ICC announced that a match between South Africa and Pakistan on 10 May 2010 was under investigation for spot-fixing. The ICC anti-corruption unit stated that two players had been questioned and that more details would be given in the next 24 hours. Pakistan won the toss and elected to Bat. In the end, Pakistan won the match by beating South Africa comfortably.\nFurther allegations (Hameed and Haider).\nPakistani cricketer, Yasir Hameed denied the allegations published in \"News of the World\" that he had turned down a bookmaker's offer of £100,000 to help fix a Test. Hameed had allegedly told the newspaper that \"almost every match\" was fixed and criticised the players involved. Yasir Hameed denied the allegations, saying that he thought he was talking to a potential sponsor, and only stated what he read on the news. In November 2010, wicketkeeper Zulqarnain Haider left the Pakistani cricket team before their fifth and decisive one-day game against South Africa, and flew from Dubai (where the series was being held) to London's Heathrow Airport. Haider asked for asylum and claimed that he had been threatened to throw the game. Haider's Pakistani stipend was suspended by the Pakistani Cricket Board. The board expressed disappointment that Haider had left the team and flown to London instead of reporting the threats to the PCB and the ICC's anti-corruption unit."

The side previously represented the Southern Zone in the Albert Baskerville Trophy. However, they now only compete in the under 15 and under 17 National Competitions. Historically, teams representing the South Island played annual fixtures against the North Island and also played touring international sides.\nTouring Teams.\nThe South Island last played an international side when they played France in 2001, losing 24–18. The team included Robert Henare and Aaron Whittaker.\nInter island matches.\n1929.\nLen Scott was injured during the match and replaced by Allan Seagar for the North Island while for the South Island Sanders was injured and replaced by Doogan. In past years the North Island team was dominated by players from the Auckland competition however the North Island team on this occasion featured players from outside Auckland such as Ted Meyer, Dick Trautvetter, Bob Stephenson, Joe Menzies, Tom Timms, and T Bergan.\n1930.\nFor the North Island v South Island trial the Devonport and Ponsonby clubs gave permission for their jerseys to be worn by the respective sides. Mick O’Brien of the South Island team broke his tibia late in the match.\n1932.\nJim Amos left the field with an injured shoulder for the South Island team and was replaced by E O'Brien.\n1935.\nThis was the 10th inter-island match stretching back to 1925.

In the meantime he had passed the ball and play moved away but was forced to stop once the referee realised what had happened. It had formed near a drain where the water had washed away the soil beneath the ground. A ball boy was photographed standing in the hole ‘buried’ to his waist. The gate receipts for the match were £608 19/ with 15,000 in attendance at the match and the trial curtain-raiser.\n1938.\nBrian Riley was initially named to play for the North Island side but as he was unable to get leave from work to potentially tour Australia if selected he was replaced in the North Island side.\n1939.\nWally Tittleton was chosen as the North Island captain while Rex King captained the South Island.\n1944.\nThis was the first time since 1939 that the North Island v South Island match had been played.

For the first two editions it was played at Club de Golf Sant Cugat, and thereafter at Real Club de Golf El Prat.\nAfter sponsors Sanyo withdrew following the 1986 tournament, promoters IMG supported the event in 1987. However persistent bad weather rendered the El Prat course unplayable and the tournament was ultimately postponed until 1988.\nThe two most notable winners were Spanish major champions Seve Ballesteros in 1985 and José María Olazábal in 1986. The final tournament in 1988 was won by England's David Whelan, who defeated Nick Faldo, Barry Lane and Mark Mouland in a four-way playoff. Whelan, who had borrowed money from his parents in order to make the trip to Spain to compete in the tournament, triumphed at the 4th extra hole after the four players had tied at 276 (12 under par) after 72 holes."

He became interested in the similarities between descriptions of successful athletes and people who said they had achieved the state of Zen. The novel spawned the Shivas Irons Society, an organization whose members combine golf and meditation. In 1997, Murphy wrote a sequel, \"The Kingdom of Shivas Irons\".\n\"Golf in the Kingdom\" is referenced in the fifth episode of season one of the television series Franklin &amp; Bash.\nPlot.\nWhile on layover on his way to an ashram in India, Michael Murphy decides to play a round of golf at Burningbush, a famous local golf course. There he meets the mysterious and charismatic golf pro Shivas Irons who over a 24-hour period teaches him about golf and spirituality.\nFilm version.\nClint Eastwood purchased the rights to the book, but abandoned the project after writing several unfinished scripts in the early 1990s.\nIn 2009, Murphy, producer Mindy Affrime and director Susan Streitfeld began filming their version of the book. Shot on location at Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, it stars David O'Hara and Mason Gamble and premiered in New York City on July 29, 2011.

        "title": "Fred Archer (baseball)",
        "text": "Frederick Marvin Archer (March 7, 1910 – October 31, 1981), also known as \"Lefty\" Archer, was an American professional baseball player whose career spanned 10 seasons, including parts of two in Major League Baseball with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1936 and 1937. Over his major league career, Archer would compile a record of 2–3 with a 6.35 earned run average (ERA) and 11 strikeouts in seven games, five starts. He also pitched in the minor leagues with the Class-D Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets, the Class-A Williamsport Grays, the Double-A Buffalo Bisons, the Class-D Lexington Indians, the Class-A1 New Orleans Pelicans, the Class-B Hazleton Mountaineers, the Class-B Lancaster Red Roses, the Class-B Winston-Salem Twins, the Class-D Landis Senators, the Class-D Statesville Owls and the Class-D Kingsport Cherokees. In 245 minor league games, Archer compiled a record of 57–84.\nProfessional career.\nArcher began his professional baseball career in 1934 with the Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets of the Class-D Bi-State League. With the Triplets, he compiled a record of 4–8 in 19 games. After not playing organized professional ball in 1935, Archer signed with the Philadelphia Athletics in 1936. Connie Mack, manager of the Athletics, signed Archer from the minor league Landis Cardinals, an independent league team. With the Cardinals, Archer threw a no-hitter on August 9, 1936. He made his debut in Major League Baseball on September 5, 1936, against the Washington Senators, pitching a 10 inning complete game, getting his first career major league win. In his first season in the majors, Archer went 2–3 with a 6.38 earned run average (ERA), two complete games and nine strikeouts in six games, five starts. He started the 1937 with the Class-A Williamsport Grays, who were members of the New York–Penn League and minor league affiliates of the Athletics. With the Grays, Archer went 10–16 with a 4.16 ERA in 42 games. He also played one game in the majors with the Athletics that season. In that game, which was against the Washington Senators, Archer gave-up two runs, both earned, in three innings pitched.\nIn 1938, Archer joined the Buffalo Bisons of the Double-A International League. The \"Buffalo Courier-Express\" said that Archer was \"a ball of fire\" during spring training in 1938. On the season, Archer went 8–14 with a 4.78 ERA in 32 games, 25 starts. During the 1939 season, Archer played with three different teams. With the Bisons, who were now affiliated with the Cleveland Indians organization, Archer went 2–3 with a 6.75 ERA in 16 games, two starts. He then joined the Class-A1 New Orleans Pelicans, who were also affiliated with Indians. With the Pelicans, Archer went 0–3 in 10 games. Finally that season, Archer joined the Class-D Lexington Indians of the Philadelphia Athletics organization and went 6–2 with a 4.17 ERA in nine games.\nArcher joined the Hazleton Mountaineers, who were later relocated to Lancaster, Pennsylvania and renamed the Lancaster Red Roses in 1940. During that season, Archer went 17–11 with a 3.06 ERA in 29 games. Amongst pitchers in the Interstate League, Archer was tied for second in wins. Archer also played for the Class-B Winston-Salem Twins of the Piedmont League, but statistics were not kept. In 1941, he continued playing with the Class-B Lancaster Red Roses. That season, Archer went 1–9 with a 5.46 ERA in 20 games. In 1943, Archer played with three different teams; the Red Roses, whom he had played with the past two seasons, the Class-D Landis Senators and the Class-D Statesville Owls. He went a combined 8–10 in 59 games between the three teams. Archer joined the Class-D Kingsport Cherokees in 1943, who were members of the Appalachian League and affiliated with the Washington Senators. With Kingsport, he went 1–4 in five games. His final season in professional baseball was in 1946. After a two-season absence from the professional circuit, he re-joined the Leaksville-Draper-Spray Triplets, whom he had played with at the start of his career in 1934. That season, Archer went 0–4 in four games.\nPersonal.\nArcher was born on March 7, 1910, in Johnson City, Tennessee. He died on October 31, 1981, in Charlotte, North Carolina at the age of 71, and was buried at West Lawn Memorial Park Landis, North Carolina."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games",
        "text": "A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, India, which received widespread media coverage both in India (the host nation) and the rest of the world.\nThe Commonwealth Games was severely criticised by several prominent Indian politicians and social activists because millions of dollars have been spent on the sporting event despite the fact that India has one of the world's largest concentration of poor people. Additionally, several other problems related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games have been highlighted by Indian investigative agencies and media outlets; these include – serious corruption by officials of the Games' .\nSocio-economic impact.\nFinancial costs.\nMiloon Kothari, a leading Indian expert on socio-economic development, remarked that the 2010 Commonwealth Games will create \"a negative financial legacy for the country\" and asked \"when one in three Indians lives below the poverty line and 40% of the hungry live in India, when 46% of India's children and 55% of women are malnourished, does spending billions of dollars on a 12-day sports event build national pride or is it a matter of national shame?\"\nOne of the outspoken critics of the Games was Mani Shankar Aiyar, former Indian Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports. In April 2007, Aiyar commented that the Games are \"irrelevant to the common man\" and criticized the Indian government for sanctioning billions of dollars for the Games even though India requires massive investment in social development programs. In July 2010, he remarked that he would be \"unhappy if the Commonwealth Games are successful\".\nAzim Premji called the 2010 Commonwealth Games a \"drain on public funds\" and said that hosting the high-expense Games in India is not justified given that the country had more important priorities facing it, such as education, infrastructure and public health.\nSocial and environmental impact.\nNearly 400,000 people from three large slum clusters in Delhi have been relocated since 2004. Gautam Bhan, an Indian urban planner and researcher working in the University of California-Berkeley, said that the 2010 Commonwealth Games have resulted in \"an unprecedented increase in the degree, frequency and scale of indiscriminate evictions without proper resettlement. We haven’t seen these levels of evictions in the last five years since the Indian Emergency\"\nIn response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed for study and statements by civil society groups, a report by the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN) - an arm of the Habitat International Coalition - detailed the social and environmental consequences of the event. It stated that \"no tolerance zones\" for beggars are enforced in Delhi, and the city has arbitrarily arrested homeless citizens under the \"Bombay Prevention of Begging Act 1959\".\nLabour laws violations.\nCampaigners in India have accused the organisers of enormous and systematic violations of labour laws at construction sites. Human Rights Law Network reports that independent investigations have discovered more than 70 cases where workers have died in accidents at construction sites since work began. Although official numbers have not been released, it is estimated that over 415,000 contract daily wage workers are working on Games projects. Unskilled workers are paid to per day while skilled workers are paid to INR per day for eight hours of work. Workers also state that they are paid to for 12 hours of work (eight hours plus four hours of overtime). Both these wages contravene the stipulated Delhi state minimum wage of for eight hours of work. Nearly 50 construction workers have died in the past two years while employed on Games projects.\nThese represent violations of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Services) Act 1979, and the constitutionally enshrined fundamental rights per the 1982 Supreme Court of India judgement on Asiad workers. The public have been banned from the camps where workers live and work – a situation which human rights campaigners say prevents the garnering of information regarding labour conditions and number of workers.\nThere have been documented instances of the presence of young children at hazardous construction sites, due to a lack of child care facilities for women workers living and working in the labour camp style work sites. Furthermore, workers on the site of the main Commonwealth stadium have reportedly been issued with hard hats, yet most work in open-toed sandals and live in cramped tin tenements in which illnesses are rife. The High Court of Delhi is presently hearing a public interest petition relating to employers not paying employees for overtime and it has appointed a four-member committee to submit a report on the alleged violations of workers rights.\nDuring the construction of the Games Village, there was controversy over financial mismanagement, profiteering by the Delhi Development Authority and private real estate companies, and inhumane working conditions.\nChild labour.\nCNN India discovery some evidences that children, as young as seven, being used in the construction of the games infrastructures. According to Siddharth Kara, who provided CNN with the evidence, he documented 14 cases of child labor within a few days. In reply to a question whether it could have been just a case of kids being present at the construction site along with their parents, he replied: \"It's not just kids playing in the dirt or using a hammer as a toy.\" He further stated about the kids: \"They're told to do the work and they just do the work. They don't know that they should be in school or that they should be playing.\"\nEven though the New Delhi,the then chief minister Sheila Dikshit claimed that nobody had approached her, according to CNN, they had tried to contact her as far back as 23 July 2010. In spite of repeated attempts, according to them, no official reply was ever made.\nUrban changes.\nAmita Baviskar, a professor of sociology from the Institute of Economic Growth, University of Delhi argues that mega-events, like the Olympics and Commonwealth Games, are used to advance narrow agendas of urban reform that cater to the middle and rich class. She focuses on how, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games, the city's slums were bulldozed in order to make room for shopping malls and expensive real estate.\nSex slavery and prostitution boom.\nThere has been a boom in the number of young girls, mostly from impoverished parts of India, coming to Delhi after being offered jobs by disguised criminals, only to be taken prisoner and forced into sex slavery. The number of victims is believed to be in the hundreds. Many brothels have been running English courses for sex workers and upgrading their facilities in anticipation of a business upturn during the games. The local government also expected that thousands of prostitutes from other countries would come to Delhi disguised as tourists and practice their profession discreetly during the Games.\n One anti-trafficking NGO has claimed that there are reports of 40,000 women being brought in from northeastern India alone. A spokesperson said that recruits from that part of India were favoured because of their lighter skin. It has been reported that over 3,000 bar girls in Mumbai disappeared;some local sources blamed on an exodus to Delhi in a focus for the Commonwealth Games.\nOrganisational failure.\nVigilance-related irregularities and Over-Invoicing.\nOn 28 July 2010, the Central Vigilance Commission, an Indian government body created to address governmental corruption, released a series of reports and documents showing the irregularities in 14 CWG projects. As per official reports, in total 129 works in 71 organisations have been inspected. The detailed preliminary findings included the award of work contracts at higher prices, poor quality assurance and management, and work contracts awarded to ineligible agencies.\nThere are also allegations of widespread corruption in various aspects of organising the games including procurement and awarding contracts for constructing the games infrastructures. The Commonwealth Games Organising Committee on 5 August 2010 suspended joint directors T S Darbari and M Jayachandran following the reports of the three-member panel which was probing the financial irregularities related to the Queen's Baton Relay.\nDuring the audit process,the Organising Committee treasurer Anil Khanna resigned from the post in the wake of allegations that his son's firm had secured a contract for laying the tennis courts . The GlobalPost news agency reports that scandals have come to light, such as \"shadowy off-shore firms, forged emails, inexplicable payments to bogus companies and inflated bills – for every purchase from toilet paper to treadmills.\" Among the alleged corruption and defrauding of the games budget, toilet paper rolls valued at $2 were costed at $80, $2 soap dispensers at $60, $98 mirrors at $220, $11,830 altitude training simulators at $250,190.\nDelays in the Works.\nIn September 2009, CGF chief Mike Fennell reported that the games were at risk of falling behind schedule and that it was \"reasonable to conclude that the current situation poses a serious risk to the Commonwealth Games in 2010\". A report by the Indian Government released several months prior found that construction work on 13 out of the 19 sports venues was very low and behind schedule.\nThe secretary-general of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) Randhir Singh has also expressed his concerns regarding the current state of affairs. Singh has called for the revamp of the Organising Committee commenting that India now has to \"retrieve the games\". Other Indian officials have also expressed dismay at the ongoing delays but they have stated that they are confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.\nAs the Times of India reports, all CWG projects were to be completed by May 2009 and until the Games they had to be disponible for the trial events. The newspaper further reports that the first stadium was handed over for trial runs in July 2010,three months before the Games. To put the delays in perspective, Beijing National Stadium was completed in 2006,two years before the 2008 Summer Olympics, while the venues for 2012 Summer Olympics in London are scheduled to be delivered one year before the games and the construction of the venues were a very behind of the schedule.\nIn August 2010, the Cabinet Secretariat took a decision to appoint 10 officers of the rank of Joint and Additional Secretaries to oversee the progress of the construction of the venues. Each officer is allocated to a venue and given the responsibility to ensure that the work completes in time for the games.\nMass volunteer walkouts.\nAround 10,000 of the 22,000 selected volunteers quit, less than a week before the event. This has been blamed on a lack of training for personnel, or dissatisfaction with assignments.Australian media reported that a large portion of this group did not even return their uniforms as a form of protest..\nPoor ticket sales and attendance.\nDuring the first days of the Games was normal to observe that several competitions were held with practically empty arenas.The only exception was the opening ceremony,wich was held in a packed stadium. In a press conference, organising chairman Suresh Kalmadi admitted that there were problems, and blamed empty venues on ticket booths not being set up outside stadiums. Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell admitted that many venues had been nearly empty on the opening day of the Games, saying \"A number of venues do not have lots of spectators. It is one area which causes us concern\". On the second day of competition, less than 100 people filled the hockey venue–the 19,000-seat MDC Stadium. Less than 20 people watched the first tennis match of the tournament in the 5,000-seat tennis stadium, and just 58 watched the netball opening rounds matchs.\nOne Indian athlete tried to buy tickets for relatives online, only to be informed by the website that tickets were sold out. When he arrived to the venue, he found the venue to be empty.This was also reported during the athletics street events and cyclig road races.\nIncidents during the Opening Ceremonies.\nSpeech of Suresh Kalmadi.\nDuring his speech at the opening ceremony, the president of the Organizing Committee, Suresh Kalmadi, faced a public embarrassment, when he was booed by spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 80,000 spectators. Kalmadi came under further another strain when he \"thanked\" the late Princess Diana for attending the opening ceremony of the games. The chairman made the blunder at a press conference saying 'Yes, Princess Diana was there,’ after which he immediately corrected himself by saying 'Prince Charles and (Camilla) the Duchess of Cornwall.\nParade of Nations.\nAustralia's chef de mission Steve Moneghetti \nexpressed the frustration of the delegation over the opening ceremony, in which there were claims that the athletes and delegation support staff were \"treated like cattle\" and subjected to \"disgraceful\" and unbearable conditions. Moneghetti also complained about the athletes being trapped in \"absolute cauldron conditions\" under the main stadium before marching for the opening ceremony. The Australians were stuck in a tunnel, where Moneghetti described the temperature as exceeding due to a lack of airconditioning and ventilation. When attempting to move out, the Australian delegation was stopped by staff. When the athletes were finally able to move out into the arena as the first delegation, they were described as being emotionally affected.\nRacism allegations.\nSome african countries representatives, complained that they are getting second-class treatment from the Games organisers, in spite of them not offering India a hand in the preparation of the Games. This delegations have alleged that accommodation given to them was inferior compared to the accommodation provided to the Australian and New Zealand teams. They went on to state that India was complaining about being victims of racial bias in the reporting of the Games; while simultaneously perpetrating the same kind of racism against the African countries.\nInfrastructure issues.\nTransport infrastructure.\nThe Delhi Airport Metro Express built by Reliance Infrastructure and CAF Beasain missed its deadline of 31 July 2010 and the private consortium was fined Rs 112.5 million.\nVillage conditions.\nLess than two weeks before the opening ceremony, Fennell wrote to the Indian cabinet secretary, urging action in response to the village being \"seriously compromised.\" He said that though team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were \"shocked\" by the state of the accommodation. \"The village is the cornerstone of any Games and the athletes deserve the best possible environment to prepare for their competition.\" The BBC published photographs of the village taken two days before 23 September showing unfinished living quarters.\nNew Zealand, Canada, Scotland and Northern Ireland have expressed concern about unliveable conditions. The Times of India newspaper reports that the leaders of the Scottish delegation apparently submitted a photograph of a dog defecating on a bed in the games village. The chef of scottish mission said that there was \"excrement in places it shouldn't be\" in the athletes' quarters and that members of visiting delegations had to clean up the unsanitary things. The BBC released images of bathrooms with brown-coloured paan stains on the walls and floor, liquids on the floor, and brown paw prints on athletes' beds. Lalit Bhanot, the secretary general of the Organising Committee, rejected the complaint that sanitation was poor by saying that,due to cultural differences,there are different standards about cleanliness in India and the western world, a statement for which he was widely ridiculed in all over the world. Bhanot went on to say of the athletes' village that, \"This is a world-class village, probably one of the best ever.\"\nMeanwhile, Pakistan also made reservations over the condition of the athletes' village and asked for an alternate accommodation to be made available to its contingent while preparation was still in progress. The Pakistan Olympic Association president Syed Arif Hasan remarked: \"We want the CGF to ensure that the athletes' village is in good condition. Athletes cannot stay at a substandard place.\" Hasan however added that there were no doubts over Pakistan's participation and the contingent would leave as planned.\nOn the other hand, England's Chef de mission Craig Hunter praised the Games Village, remarking that \"the Commonwealth Games Village here [in New Delhi] is better than the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics\". He added that the arrangements at the Games Village is much better than that at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nCanada's sports minister also supported the Games, saying that big events always face issues, and the media often exaggerates them, as Canada found during the 2010 Winter Olympics. He added that \"We are coming in full force.\"\nProblems with functionality of equipments and infrastructure during events.\nOn the first night of swimming events, debris landed in the swimming pool, causing delays ahead of a race. It is believed that part of the ceiling or its paint had fallen off.\nBefore the last night of swimming finals, the water filtration system broke down and the pool was turbid and murky during the warmup session and the finals; it was described as the least clear ever seen for a swimming competition until the 2016 Summer Olympics.A disproportionate number of swimmers from Australia and Malaysia ill with intestinal infeccions, leading to concerns over the cleanliness and sanitation of the pool.\nEarly suspicions rested on the quality of water in the swimming pools of the SPM Pools Complex, but other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness. Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the \"chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote\" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village. He suggested that it could be a common case of Traveler's diarrhea (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer Rebecca Adlington said that the water quality was absolutely fine.\nDuring the opening ceremony,some areas of the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium field suffered damage. Some areas of the lawn and parts of the track and also the walls needed to be replaced. During the dismantling of the temporary structures, the affected areas were renovated and the lawn was replanted.\nVandalism of Games Village by Athletes.\nCondoms and toilet blockages.\nAn Indian newspaper during the games reported that used condoms flushed down the toilets in the athlete's village had caused some drains to become blocked, necessitating action by plumbers to clear the pipes.\nAthletes under investigation for trashing apartments.\nAustralian athletes have been accused of vandalizing the towers of the athletes' village they were staying in by breaking furniture and electrical fittings. Delhi Police did not press the case after the Organizing Committee refused to file a complaint while Indian external affairs minister SM Krishna dismissed it as a one-off incident.\nA washing machine was hurled from the eighth floor of the same tower. Nobody on the ground was hit, but it is unclear who the culprit was. Indian newspapers have reported that the Australian Commonwealth Games Authority agreed to pay for the damages and have apologised for the incident. The Australian High Commissioner rejected the claim, stating that the incident was the result of partying and celebrations. Later comments by Australian officials have contradicted claims by Lalit Bhanot that they had admitted responsibility. Perry Crosswhite said that it was still unclear if athletes from other nations present in the tower at the time had been responsible.\nSafety and security concerns.\nSmall monkeys roam Delhi's streets and prefer heavily urbanized areas with plenty of living space among the buildings and cannot be killed because many Indians see them as sacred so instead a larger, domesticated species of monkey, the langur, is brought to the Games Village in to scare away the smaller monkeys.buildings. \nOn the second day of the games, three Ugandan delegates were injured by a malfunctioning security barrier at the games' village, and a senior official from that country raised allegations of discrimination by Indian officials. Uganda's sports minister lashed out at Indian officials and demanded an apology for the accident. The officials had cuts and bruises and were hospitalized overnight for observation. The chairman of the Games' Organising Committee, Suresh Kalmadi, apologized to the Ugandan High Commissioner to India for the incident.\nInfrastructural fallures.\nOn 21 September 2010, a footbridge under construction for the Games near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium collapsed, injuring at least 23 people who were working at the structure, mainly workers, underscoring fears of poor workmanship. Commenting on the incident, the then Chief Minister of Delhi Sheila Dikshit controversially remarked that the footbridge was only meant for spectators and not for athletes. Following the collapse, Fennell expressed again the concerns that conditions at the Games Village, which had \"shocked the majority\", would seriously compromise the entire event. The company that was building the foot bridge, P&amp;R Infraprojects, was subsequently blacklisted by the Delhi Government and was not allowed to get government contracts.\nReportedly, progress was still slow and four or five towers at the Games village were unfinished, lacking facilities such as wireless internet, fitted toilets and plumbing. In addition, rubble, unused masonry and discarded bricks littered the unfinished gardens. According to sports historian Boria Majumdar, author of the \"Sellotape Legacy: Delhi and the Commonwealth Games\", India \"may have to pull a miracle.\" The father of Australian track cyclist Kaarle McCulloch visited his daughter at the Olympic village. A know builder in Australia, Grahame McCulloch criticised the structural soundness of the village; he said \"those buildings are the dodgiest things I have ever seen...so substandard\". He told his daughter not to use the balcony, fearing that it was collapsible.\nThe next day after the catwalk fell, part of the drop ceiling of the Commonwealth Games weightlifting collapsed.\nAlso on the same day,Indian bantamweight boxer Akhil Kumar's bed in the Games village collapsed when he sat on it. \"I sat down on my bed to rest but suddenly it gave way. After that I noticed that part of it has no plywood\", he said\nOn 27 September 2010,the South African delegation reported that a snake was present in a athlete room in the Games Village. A day earlier, animal authorities had to be called in to evacuate a king cobra from the tennis arena's sewage system.\nOn 7 October,during the Games day 4,the \nscoreboard at the Delhi University Stadium crashed to the ground when a supporting chain snapped. As the competition would start a week after the incident, there was no harm to the athletes or the event..\nTerrorist threats.\nFollowing the 2008 Mumbai attacks, some athletes and their representative bodies expressed security fears during the games. In April 2010, during the Indian Premier League, two low intensity bombs went off outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore. Although there were no casualties, this postponed the start of the game by an hour. Following this attack, foreign cricketers like Kevin Pietersen expressed fears for their safety and questions were raised regarding the safety of athletes during the Commonwealth Games . Although cricket is not present on this edition's program,the UK and Canada authorities also warned about potential attacks on commercial targets in Delhi ahead of the games.\nJama Masjid Mosque incident.\nOn 19 September 2010, unknown gunmen on a motorbike opened fire with an automatic pistol on a tourist bus outside the Jama Masjid Mosque mosque in Delhi. The attacks, which came a fortnight before the start of the games, injured two taiwanese tourists. Two hours later, a Maruti car exploded in the vicinity, reportedly from a deliberate low-intensity pressure cooker bomb which had been assembled inside. No fatalities or major damages were reported. The incidents, which were purportedly claimed by the Indian Mujahideen group, provoked fears about lack of security in the city for the upcoming games. However, police in Delhi initially denied the role of any organised terror group and instead blamed the attacks on \"disgruntled youths and local criminal gangs.\" Officials suggested that a possible motive of the strike was to instill fear in people ahead of the Commonwealth Games.\nFear of a dengue outbreak.\nIn 2010,the heaviest monsoon rains in 15 years was recorded in India, along with large quantities of standing water on CWG construction sites as well as in tanks and ponds,this situation raised concerns over increased levels of Aedes aegypti larvae and mosquitoes in Delhi. In the run-up to the games it was reported that 65-70 cases of dengue fever were being diagnosed each day in the city, with the number of cases \"likely to hit the 3,000 mark\" at the opening ceremonies day in 3 October.\nWater related Illness.\nMany swimmers were reported to have fallen ill. Initially, concerns were raised over the quality of water in the swimming pools of the SPM Swimming Pool Complex. It was said that more than 20 percent of the English team's swimmers – about eight to 10 competitors – had been struck down with a stomach virus. The Australian team also reported that at least six of its swimmers had been sick, including Andrew Lauterstein, who had to withdraw from the 50-meter butterfly. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell said officials would conduct tests to make sure the pools were not the source of the illness. \"If there is something unsafe, you cannot swim in that water. It is a matter we have to deal with a great deal of urgency,\" he said.\nHowever, other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness. Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the \"chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote\" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village. He suggested that it could be a common case of Traveler's diarrhea (locally called \"Delhi belly\"), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer Rebecca Adlington said that the water quality was absolutely fine.\nBoycotts.\nFollowing the withdrawal of Dani Samuels, the then women's world discus champion, because \"[her] safety [was] more important to them than a medal,\" Australia's Minister for Sport, Mark Arbib, said CWG officials expected more competitors to follow suit.\nThe departure of last part of the Scottish delegation ended up being delayed for 48 hours, andcalso the Welsh team set a deadline of 22 September to receive reassurances that the venues would be fit for purpose. The first group of English athletes, which included the lawn bowls team and a men's hockey squad, said the organisers were not making nearly enough progress just a day before they were to leave. \"The Guardian\" suggested a mass walkout remained an option with the \"point of no return\" less than a week before the opening ceremonies; they claimed the \"main competing countries would be likely to act in concert.\"They also suggested the games were on the verge of \"descending into farce.\"\nMichael Cavanagh, the chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said a decision to stay away would be a joint one, as he insisted a possible knock on effects for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow would not be a factor. He said \"In terms of withdrawal we don't see this as simply a Team Scotland decision, any decision to withdraw we would see as being a collective decision amongst the countries who are already there and already concerned. We can't allow ourselves to be influenced by thoughts of how it may impact on 2014, not when we have something as important as the safety of our athletes to consider.\" Phillips Idowu, the then world triple jump champion, also withdrew from the Games.\nCalls for boycott.\nAmidst allegations of blatant corruption, shoddy construction work at venues and security concerns for participating athletes, the 2010 Commonwealth Games have faced numerous boycott calls from individuals in India, England and Australia.\nWithin India, there were calls for boycott.A group of celebrities also called a boycott.This groupe included former Indian cricket captain and spin bowler Bishan Singh Bedi and bestselling Indian author Chetan Bhagat.\nBedi said the \"CWG organisers have taken the country for a ride\" and urged international athletes to boycott the \"embarrassing\" Delhi games. Bhagat, who is considered a youth icon in India with a huge fan following, called the Commonwealth games the \"biggest and most blatant exercise in mass corruption since the country won their independence six decades ago.\" Bhagat, who has sold more than 4 million books in India, also urged his readers to boycott the games event and not to watch them on TV, thereby using the \"golden chance\" to \"put the corrupt and insensitive government to shame.\"\nThe Jat community seeking reservation under the OBC quota have also planned to use the Commonwealth games as a platform and force the Indian government to relent to their needs.\nOther associations also threatened to boycott the games. Considering the potential impact of a terror threat and other security concerns, rumors arose about a boycott of the Delhi Commonwealth Games by major participating nations including Scotland, England and New Zealand. However, the rumors were soon put to rest by Commonwealth games committees in each of these countries who expressed a general level of satisfaction with the security arrangements.\nAustralian quadruple Olympic gold medal winning swimmer Dawn Fraser called for Australia to boycott the games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which unfolded in the 1972 Summer Olympics. Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' \"word for providing security should not be taken at its face value.\" However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Association was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event. John Coates, Australian Olympic Committee president, came down hard on the organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. \"I don't think it is a cultural thing. When you agree to host [the Games], you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. The Games shouldn't have been awarded to Delhi in hindsight.\"\nSporting controversies.\nDoping.\nJust before the Games, the Indian team suffered seven casualties when four wrestlers, two swimmers and a shot putter were cut from the team as a result of positive tests for methylhexaneamine. Four others, who were not picked for the Games, also failed drug tests conducted at the various training camps across the country.\nThe same substance was recorded in the examination of Nigerian runner Oludamola Osayomi who won the women's 100 meters on athletics in a event with hit by another big controversies. Another Nigerian athlete, hurdler Samuel Okon who placed sixth in the 110 metres hurdles, was reported to have tested positive for the same drug.\nIn July 2011, three of the four women from India's gold-medal winning 400-metre-relay team tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Two of the racers, Sini Jose and Jauna Murmu, tested positive for the anabolic steroid methandienone, and Tiana Mary Thomas tested positive for epi-methandienone.\nAudience Behavior during some Events.\nArchery.\nWhile the audience's behaviour at the archery event provoked criticism from the English team, the silver medallist, Alison Williamson, praised it on the other hand. Earlier reports held that the English team was upset because the loud chant of the crowd during the women's recurve event had distracted the archers. In an action condemned in the Indian media, an English archery official allegedly abused an Indian coach, telling him to \"f*** off.\" The comment came after the Indian team registered a one-point win over England to claim the gold medal. The Indian archery head coach, Limba Ram, walked over to shake hands with officials of the rival team. In response, an English official showed his elbow in a gesture before uttering the remarks. Britain's archery team leader said she was unaware of the incident and added, \"[the Indian coach] must find out whether the person was one among us. If he was not wearing a red jersey, he would not be part of the side. I will speak to the Indian coach about it.\" Limba Ram said that he failed to identify the person as he had chosen to ignore the one-off incident. There have also been accusations that Ram was called a monkey on two different occasions by an English official.\nAthletics.\nDuring the Final of the Women's 100m sprint final, a controversy was caused by the eventual disqualification of Sally Pearson of Australia. She had won the race on the third attempted start after one start was delayed because of excessive crowd noise and the second due to a false start by Laura Turner of England. Pearson was disqualified because she was deemed to have false-started in the second attempted restart along with Turner. This was as a direct result of a protest lodged by Team England. The controversy was caused as only Turner was disqualified from the race during the race because of a false start and not Pearson. Turner ran the race under protest. Pearson and other athletes were not informed of the protest until four hours after the race, as they were waiting to begin the medal presentation for the race. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell called Pearson's treatment \"unsatisfactory\" and that the whole situation was caused by an \"unacceptable communications blunder\".\nBoxing Weight-in.\nDuring the weigh-in for the boxing competition, the scales were giving inaccurate readings with athletes recording higher body weights on the official scales. The scales were deemed to be broken and the weigh-in was delayed 24 hours to find and calibrate new scales. The initial wrong measurements led to angry shouting between coaches, athletes and organisers. During the boxing competition there have been claims made by various teams including England and Botswana that jabs were not being scored by judges. This was attributed to the removal of a white scoring zone placed on the boxers gloves which is usually present in amateur boxing events. The BBC commentating team also claimed there to be a bias in judges scores towards Indian competitors.\nCycling.\nDuring the final of the Men's Keirin, Malaysian Azizulhasni Awang was disqualified for aggressive interference when he forced his way past two competitors. Race winner Josiah Ng said he was \"mystified\" over Awang's disqualification. In the semi-final round of the keirin, Australia's Shane Perkins was disqualified for dangerous riding with the official reason not being made clear. Perkins subsequently won the classification race and was described by Chris Boardman from the BBC to \"have aimed an angry V-sign at officials\"; he gestured to the judges with his index and middle finger held together. No subsequent action was taken against Perkins who later said, \"the officials need to go back to school\", referencing poor decisions he felt had been made in the sprint and keirin events.\nSwimming.\nOn another occasion, South African swimmer Roland Schoeman came under criticism when he referred to the crowd at the swimming as \"going on like monkeys\" in a post-race poolside interview. Schoeman's remarks came after he narrowly avoided being disqualified as he and England's Simon Burnett fell in at the start of the 50m freestyle when distracted by the crowd noise. The swimming has been persistently affected by Indian spectators ignoring etiquette and shouting out while the competitors were preparing for the start. His comment was regarded as possibly being a racial ethnic slur, although he later said that the word was commonly used in South Africa to refer to mischievous behaviour. At an official press conference, organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot took the complaints about monkeys literally. Not being aware of the complaints, Bhanot felt Delhi's wildlife was at issue: \"We know especially at the swimming pool there are a lot of monkeys and we have made efforts to keep them away from the swimming pool.\"\nWrestling.\nAustralian wrestler Hassene Fkiri was ejected from the 96 kg Greco-Roman competition and stripped of the silver medal after making an obscene gesture at the international FILA judges during the final. According to an Australian official, Fkiri was furious at his Indian rival Anil Kumar, who he accused of breaking the rules a number of times in the first period by holding Fkiri around the neck and head with two hands. The Australian received his first warning after he made a comment to the referee as he walked off the mat at the end of the two-minute period; when Kumar repeated the same move in the next round, Fkiri headbutted him and was issued a second warning. He then proceeded to swing his arms uncontrollably afterwards, which resulted in his third warning and eventual disqualification. After losing, Fkiri refused to shake hands with the victor.\nReactions and responses.\nResponding to media concerns, the organisers said there were 48 hours to save the Games after warnings of a pull out.\nNumerous Bollywood actors also expressed their dismay at the state of the Games.\nFour days before the start of the games, tickets for the opening, closing ceremonies, and the 100 m athletics were still not sold out.\nThe Sydney Morning Herald wrote that despite Kalmadi's \"blind optimism\", the games were not going to be the best ever. Instead, it wrote that it was \"probably the most interesting.\"\nThe opening ceremony played a key role in improving the image of the Games. As athletes arrived and competitions started, many earlier critics changed their view. The Australian Sports Minister said that India could now aim for the Olympics, and the President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid. As the Games concluded, many observers remarked that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending. Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.\nWithin India, the Games saw criticism due to the Games' origins as a celebration of the British Empire, with Arindam Chaudhuri arguing for India's disassociation from the \"slavish games\" which he viewed as a \"celebration of racial discrimination, colonialism [and] imperialism\".\nCriticism by Mani Shankar Aiyar.\nMani Shankar Aiyar, a senior member of the ruling Indian National Congress party and former Minister of Youth and Sports Affairs was an early whistleblower from the Indian Union Cabinet who expressed concern over extensive delays in preparation leading to unplanned expenses which he said, could have been utilized for \"ensuring a better sporting future for Indian children by providing them sports training\". Aiyar also said that he would be \"unhappy\" if the Games were a success and wished for the \"Commonwealth Games to be spoiled.\"\nAiyar's frank media admission proved a public embarrassment for Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman Suresh Kalmadi who labelled him \"anti national\" for wishing that the Commonwealth Games are \"spoilt.\" Kalmadi's remark received extensive criticism in Indian media.\nAiyar also told an Australian TV channel that India is \"probably the poorest country of the Commonwealth\". Bangladesh, among other countries, has a lower GDP per capita/purchasing power parity.\nAllegations of corruption and financial irregularities.\nThe day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organizing Committee (OC). The probe committee was led by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India V. K. Shunglu. This probe was in addition to the Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation, Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Enforcement Directorate, and Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) investigations already underway. The then Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh, had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given \"\"severe and exemplary\" punishment\" after the Games. The committee was given three months time to submit its report.\nA total of 53 corruption cases were being examined by the CVC. As of September 2012, 28 of them were still in different stages of investigation, 13 were referred to CBI for further investigation and 12 were closed.\nTiming-Scoring-Result (TSR) case.\nThis case relates to allegations of corruption in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm\nCBI investigation and chargesheet.\nOn 25 April 2011, CBI arrested former CWG Organising Committee (OC) chairman Suresh Kalmadi in the Timing-Scoring-Result (TSR) case. He was arrested under Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.\nOn 20 May 2011, CBI filed the first chargesheet in a special CBI court against Kalmadi. The CBI alleged that he was the \"main accused\" in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm. The chargesheet said, \"Kalmadi is the main accused as he was the person with all supreme powers. He had the supreme over-riding powers in the Organising Committee of the CWG, 2010.\" In addition to Kalmadi, the CBI named two companies and eight persons including OC former Secretary General Lalit Bhanot and former Director General VK Verma as accused.\nThe accused were charged under various provisions of the Indian Penal Code sections dealing with criminal conspiracy, forging documents and using fake documents as genuine, Section 13 (1) (d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.\nAccording to the charge sheet, the accused allegedly awarded the lucrative contract to the Swiss firm to install a TSR system for the Commonwealth Games at an excessive cost, causing a loss of over to the exchequer. The investigation revealed that officials of the OC had conspired with private persons for awarding the contract at an excessive net cost of about as compared to a net bid of Spain-based company for approximately . This resulted in a loss of about by wrongly eliminating all competitors of Swiss-based company. Two bids were received for TSR contract from Swiss Timing and MSL Spain and they were opened on 4 November 2009. However, much before that, on 12 October 2009, Kalmadi and Verma had announced that the contract would be awarded to Swiss Timing.\nTrial.\nOn 4 February 2013, the court of special CBI judge Ravinder Kaur found sufficient prima facie evidence and ordered framing of charges against all the accused. The charges framed were: cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing a loss of over Rs 900 million under the Prevention of Corruption Act. As the accused pleaded not guilty, the court ordered that daily Criminal trial (for 5 days a week) will begin from 20 February.\nQueen's Baton Relay (QBR) case.\nThe QBR event was held on 29 October 2009. The allegation was that, the Organising Committee (OC) awarded the work of transportation in QBR event to AM Car and Van Hire Ltd at excessively high rates without following a standard tender process.\nAfter completing investigations, CBI filed its second charge-sheet (after the charge-sheet in TSR case) in a special CBI court in Delhi. The CBI named OC officials T S Darbari, Sanjay Mohindroo, Jeychandran and London-based businessman Ashish Patel and his two companies AM Car n Van Hire and AM Films. The chargesheet alleged that OC members conspired to award contracts of local transportation and others to Patel's companies at excessive rates during the event held in London in 2009.\nThe accused were charged under Indian Penal Code sections relating to criminal conspiracy to cheat and forgery along with violations of Prevention of Corruption Act.\nVenue Development Support case.\nA Swiss company was awarded a contract of over for providing venue development support services to the Organising Committee (OC). However, it was alleged that Prime Minister appointed VK Shunglu Committee found serious cases of forgery and irregularity with the contract. The committee said that, \"Undue pressure was brought within the OC for engaging the company for the contract\" and recommended that CBI or ED should take up the case for appropriate action.\nBased on Shunglu Committee's findings, CBI registered an FIR against Suresh Kalmadi, Lalit Bhanot and AK Mattoo on 23 August 2012.\nOn 23 March 2014, the Hindustan Times reported that \"...the investigation into the alleged irregularities committed is stumbling with the CBI having closed its FIR related to grant of two contracts to a Swiss firm for lack of evidence.\"\nOther cases.\nCBI sources revealed in July 2012 that the probe against alleged corruption in construction of Barapullah Flyover and grant of Bail-out Package to EMAAR MGF is likely to be closed in the absence of substantiating evidence.\nReferences.\n \n \n "

        "text": "Harold William Peel (June 21, 1879 – November 28, 1944) was a Canadian early professional ice hockey player with the Pittsburgh Keystones of the Western Pennsylvania Hockey League. He was a member of the Keystones 1902 WPHL championship team.\nBiography.\nHarry Peel was one of the first openly professional hockey players. In 1902 he disclosed that he was paid $35 a week to play for the Pittsburgh Keystones. This was a violation of the team's amateur status. As a result, both Canadian and U.S. officials disallowed all amateur teams to play against the Keystones and Peel's amateur status was revoked by the Ontario Hockey Association. He issued two appeals that were rejected on December 10, 1903 and again on November 30, 1904.\nHowever, professional hockey expanded and the WPHL embraced its new professional status. As a result, the league expanded to four teams by adding the Pittsburgh Victorias, and openly enticed the best talent it could, including future Hockey Hall of Fame members Hod and Bruce Stuart from the Quebec Bulldogs, Alf Smith from the Ottawa Hockey Club and Riley Hern from the Stratford Legionnaires.\nPeel died in November 1944 and is buried at Mount Pleasant Cemetery and Crematorium in his hometown of London, Ontario."

However, because the rugby pitch was frozen, the match was switched to the cricket field. Vic Hey scored the only try of the match, and Jack Kelly became the only player to ever kick a goal on the cricket pitch in a 5-0 win. He spent most of his career at Leeds behind Charles \"Charlie\" Eaton for the position, but he still managed to play in 83 matches, mainly during the Emergency Leagues throughout World War II. On Saturday 6 December 1941 Leeds played St. Helens at Headingley Stadium, the St. Helens team was a man short, so Jack Kelly played as a stand-in for them.\nNote.\nSomeone named Jack Kelly played rugby league for Wests and North Sydney during the 1920s and 1930s, and someone named J Kelly played rugby league for Newtown Bluebags during the 1940s; however, these footballers are unlikely to be this Jack Kelly."

        "text": "Clare Jack Wheeler (October 31, 1908 – February 26, 1990) was an American football player. He played in the backfield for the University of Michigan from 1928 to 1930 and was the Most Valuable Player on the 1930 Michigan Wolverines football team.\nEarly life.\nA native of Bay City, Michigan, Wheeler began to attain athletic prominence playing halfback and quarterback for the football team at Bay City Central High School from 1924 to 1926.\nCollege career.\nAfter graduating from high school, he enrolled at the University of Michigan and played on the freshman football team in 1927. As a sophomore in 1928, Wheeler started three games at the halfback position for Michigan's varsity football team. As a junior in 1929, he started two games at the fullback position.\nWheeler had his best season as a senior in 1930. He demonstrated his versatility by playing all three backfield positions (quarterback, halfback and fullback) for the undefeated 1930 Michigan Wolverines football team that compiled a record of 8–0–1.\nIn the 1930 season opener, Wheeler was the Wolverines' starting quarterback and scored two touchdowns in a 33–0 victory over ].\nHis performance in the fourth game of the 1930 season helped secure his reputation. Michigan trailed Purdue 13–0 at the end of the first quarter. Wheeler and sophomore quarterback Harry Newman were sent into the game in the second quarter and led Michigan to a come-from-behind victory and a final score of 14–13. Wheeler did most of the ball carrying on the drive that resulted in Michigan's winning touchdown. Wheeler scored the winning touchdown with an eight-yard run on \"the old 83 play.\" The following week, Wheeler was Michigan's leading rusher in a 13– win over Ohio State. He also caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Harry Newman in a 15–7 win over Illinois. In the seventh week of the 1930 season, Wheeler scored the only touchdown in Michigan's 7–0 win over Minnesota in the annual competition for the Little Brown Jug. Wheeler scored the touchdown in the first quarter on a 45-yard punt return which a newspaper account of the game described as follows:\"Wheeler's run will go down as one of Michigan's, classics. He got the ball after a low, twisting kick by [Clarence] Munn had traveled to the Minnesota 45-yard line. Wheeler gathered it in and charged. He hit two Minnesota tacklers and knifed his way between them. He staggered a yard or two from the impact and sidestepped another Gopher tackler. Morrison came across like a charging bull to take another from Wheeler's path. He waved away, and slid yards across the goal line on his dive for a touchdown.\"\nMichigan head coach Harry Kipke praised Wheeler's performance during the 1930 season as follows:\"He was our offensive spark, as well as our best ground gainer. He lacked confidence up to this year, it seems, but he had it when this season opened and he got better as the season progressed. He worked effectively with Simrall, Hudson and Newman in carrying out the running attack. He blocked well for them, and they for him.\"\nDespite his slight build at 155 pounds, Wheeler scored 30 of the 111 points scored by Michigan in 1930 and was selected as a first-team All-Big Ten player by Claire Burcky of the Newspaper Editors Association. Burckey explained his selection of Wheeler as follows: \"The reason Jack Wheeler, the Bay City boy, made my team is because he kept Michigan going when Harry Newman failed. Wheeler's punt handling, run-backs and interception of passes provided the brightest bits of ball lugging Michigan showed to the conference this season.\"\nWheeler was voted by his teammates on the 1930 Michigan team as the recipient of the Most Valuable Player award. He also finished second behind Wes Fesler in the voting for the Chicago Tribune Silver Football trophy awarded to the Most Valuable Player in the Big Ten Conference.\nLate life.\nIn February 1990, Wheeler died at age 81. He was a resident of Midland, Michigan at the time of his death."

Since its inception, the SELC membership has expanded dramatically due to the explosive growth of high school and youth lacrosse in the Southeast.\nThe SELC has provided consistent collegiate competition among the member teams, produced viable team/player recognition awards and stages a first-class championship event. Additionally, the league is seeing successful high school players from the typical lacrosse base of the eastern seaboard come south for educational opportunities which have improved the quality of play of these teams.\nTeams.\nCurrently, 10 different teams are in the SELC Division I. All of the SELC DI teams are members of NCAA Division I.

The 3-time PDC World Championship finalist Peter Manley was also another notable absentee, having missed out since 1998.\nFormat and qualifiers.\nThe televised stages featured 72 players from a minimum of 22 countries. The top 32 players in the PDC Order of Merit on 29 November 2010 were seeded for the tournament. They were joined by the 16 highest non qualified players in the Players Championship Order of Merit from events played on the PDC Pro Tour.\nThese 48 players were joined by two PDPA qualifiers (which were determined at a PDPA Qualifying event held in Derby on November 29, 2010), and 22 international players: the 4 highest names in the European Order of Merit not already qualified, the 2 highest names in the North American Order of Merit not already qualified and 16 further international qualifiers determined by the PDC and PDPA.\nSome of the international players, such as the 4 from the European Order of Merit, and the top American and Australian players were entered straight into the first round, while others, having won qualifying events in their countries, were entered into the preliminary round.\nOrder of Merit\nPro Tour\nEuropean Order of Merit\"First round qualifiers\"\nPDPA qualifiers\"First round qualifier\"\n\"Preliminary round qualifier\"\nInternational qualifiers\"First round qualifiers\"\n\"Preliminary round qualifiers\"\nPrize money.\nThe 2011 World Championship featured a prize fund of £1,000,000 – the same as in the previous year. The Third Place Playoff did not take place this year.\nThe prize money is allocated as follows:\nDraw.\nPreliminary round.\nThe preliminary round was played from Dec 16 to Dec 23 with one match per day. The format was best of 7 legs.\nLast 64.\nThe winner of the eight preliminary-round matches joined 56 other players in the first round.\nThe first round draw took place on Tuesday 30 November live in the studio of Sky Sports News, and was conducted by 1983 World champion Keith Deller and Sky Sports darts' analyst and former World Matchplay champion, Rod Harrington.\nRepresentation from different countries.\nThis table shows the number of players by country in the World Championship, the total number including the preliminary round.\nTelevision coverage.\nSky Sports broadcast all 72 matches live in high-definition in the United Kingdom. Dave Clark presented the coverage with analysis from Rod Harrington and Eric Bristow. They also commentated on matches along with Sid Waddell (in his final PDC World Darts Championship commentating appearance), John Gwynne, Nigel Pearson, Rod Studd and Stuart Pyke. This was the first PDC World Championship where Dave Lanning wasn't commentating having retired prior to the tournament. Due to the ill health of Harrington, Wayne Mardle replaced him post-Christmas and featured both commentating and co-presenting alongside Clark. Former England cricketer Andrew Flintoff was also a guest commentator twice during tournament. Interviews were handled by either Clark, Bristow or Studd.\nIn the Netherlands SBS6 broadcast all matches live through a live stream on the SBS6 website and Sport1 broadcast all the matches on television, both with commentary provided by Jacques Nieuwlaat and Leo Oldenburger. In Germany it was broadcast live on Sport1 with co-commentary provided by Roland Scholten, and in Australia it was broadcast live on Fox Sports."

        "title": "Swimming Reindeer",
        "text": "The Swimming Reindeer is a 13,000-year-old Magdalenian sculpture of two swimming reindeer conserved in the British Museum. The sculpture was made in what is now modern-day France by an unknown sculptor who carved the artwork from the tip of a mammoth tusk. The sculpture was found in two pieces in 1866, but it was not until 1904 that Abbé Henri Breuil realised that the two pieces fit together to form a single artwork of two reindeer swimming nose-to-tail.\nDiscovery.\nThe pieces of the sculpture were discovered by a French engineer, Peccadeau de l’Isle, in 1866 while he was trying to find evidence of early man on the banks of the River Aveyron, although contemporary accounts attributed the find to Victor Brun, a local antiquarian. At the time, de l'Isle was employed in the construction of a railway line from Montauban to Rodez, and while digging for artefacts in his spare time he found some prehistoric flint tools and several examples of late Ice Age prehistoric art in a rock shelter of Bruniquel. The finds took the name of the rock shelter : \"abri Montastruc\" (Montastruc rock shelter). The hill was estimated to be high, and the artefacts were found beneath an overhang that extended for about along the river and enclosed an area of 298 square yards (249 m2). De l'Isle had to dig through of material to get to the level where the artefacts were found. At this time it was thought that there were two separate carvings of reindeer as it was not obvious that the two pieces fitted together.\nDe l'Isle wrote a paper on his discovery, and his finds were exhibited in 1867 at the Exposition Universelle in Paris. People were intrigued to see the sophistication of his finds and this sculpture in particular. The carvings were remarkable in that they illustrate reindeer, which no longer live in France. Dating was possible as the two reindeer were carved in the ivory of an extinct animal. This dated the find as ancient and required a re-evaluation of the life of humans in the late Ice Age. This find was particularly astounding, as at that time no cave paintings had been discovered, and it was to be some years before those that were found were accepted as genuine. In fact it was only the work of Henry Christy and Edouard Lartet that had recently persuaded informed opinion that mankind had lived during the ice age and coexisted with mammoths.\nThe evidence for coexistence came not only from the reindeer but also from a carved spear thrower which was found in the same location. This device was used to gain extra leverage when throwing a spear. In this case it was made from a piece of reindeer antler that had been carved into the shape of a mammoth.\nThe reindeer sculptures were again exhibited in 1884 in Toulouse, when it is speculated that a French buyer might have been found, but they were eventually procured by the British Museum in 1887. De l'Isle initially offered his finds to the British Museum for the large sum of 150,000 francs, which would have a value in excess of half a million pounds in 2010. The offer was considered much too high and was not accepted by Augustus Franks, an enthusiastic antiquarian who was in charge of the north European collection at that time. Franks had been known to fund the museum's acquisitions himself, and he sent Charles Hercules Read to negotiate with de l'Isle. Read successfully managed to bring the price down to £500 (about £30,000 today). The purchase was funded by the Christy Fund, a £5,000 bequest by Henry Christy who had also left his own collections to the museum.\nIt was not until 1904 when Abbé Breuil saw the sculptures whilst visiting the British Museum that he realised that the two pieces fitted together, and were in fact two parts of a single sculpture.\nThe sculpture is kept in a controlled atmosphere and is rarely moved. The ivory is now very fragile and it is feared that it could \"turn to dust\" if it were treated roughly. Unlike the mammoth spear thrower, the reindeer sculpture has no practical purpose, and is considered to be the oldest piece of art in any British museum.\nAge.\nThe finds came from the late Ice Age, which Henry Christy and Edouard Lartet originally called the \"age of the reindeer\". That is notable as the carving of mammoth ivory depicted reindeer and the mammoth spear thrower was carved from a reindeer antler. That fixes the co-existence of reindeer, mammoths and man at a time that the area had a climate similar to that of Siberia today.\nLater, this period became known as Magdalenian, named after a French cave, Abri de la Madeleine, where similar art to the \"Swimming Reindeer\" were found.\nAppearance.\nThe sculpture shows a female reindeer closely followed by a larger male reindeer. The larger male is indicated by his size, antlers and genitals, whilst the female has her teats modelled. The reindeer are thought to be swimming in illustration of the migration of deer that would have taken place each autumn. It is known that it would be autumn as both reindeer are shown with antlers, and only during autumn do both male and female reindeer have antlers. At this time of year reindeer would be much easier to hunt, and the meat, skin and antlers would be at their best. Each of the reindeer has been marked with a burin to show different colouring and texture in the deer's coat. Oddly there are ten deeper cuts on each side of the back of the leading female reindeer. These may have been intended to indicate coloured markings, but their purpose is unclear.\nFormer Director of the British Museum Neil MacGregor says of the manufacturing process:\n\"History of the World in 100 Objects\".\nThis sculpture was chosen as object 4 in the \"History of the World in 100 Objects\". This was a series of radio programmes created in a partnership between the BBC and the British Museum."

The first recorded match on the ground was in 1962, when Brackley Cricket Club moved from its original ground at Manor Road.\nIn 1971, the ground held its first List-A match when Northamptonshire played Gloucestershire in the John Player League. From 1971 to 1975, the ground hosted 5 List-A matches, the last of which saw Northamptonshire play Nottinghamshire in 1975 John Player League.\nIn local domestic cricket, the ground is the home venue of Brackley Cricket Club.\nPrevious grounds.\n\"Bandilands\".\nThe first recorded game of cricket in Brackley was in 1827, when 11 gentlemen from Brackley were defeated by 11 form the neighboring village of Syresham. It's assumed that this match was played at the Bandilands (sometimes referred to as Bandlands) ground, which was located close to a toll gate on the Buckingham, Brackely and Banbury turnpike - this is now the A422.\nBandilands hosted Brackley for many years, in games vs local teams such as Banbury and Deddington (1830s), Buckingham (1842 - this match brought with it much controversy as Buckingham fielded a player who farmed half a mile away from Buckingham itself. Brackley objected stating it was arranged to be \"town against town, not parish against parish\"). In June 1865, \"a large company\" assembled to watch George Parr's All-England Eleven defeat 22 from Brackley Cricket Club (including Joseph Timms, grandfather of future Northamptonshire County Cricket Club stalwart Jack Timms) by 80 runs. A year later, Surrey professionals Thomas Humphrey and Harry Jupp brought a team to Brackley, and comfortably beat 16 locals, though this game \"did not attract a large attendance\". In 1882, Brackley CC competed in the inaugural Northamptonshire Rural Challenge Cup, beating Eydon by an innings in the first round but losing to Rushden in the second (Rushden were the eventual winners of the tournament).\n\"Manor Road\".\nBandilands was home to Brackley CC until 1910, when they moved to one of the school's playing fields for a yearly rent of £15 10s around the outbreak of the First World War (approximately £1,120.33 today). The club had many concerns over its security of tenure at the Manor Road ground and was eventually asked to leave the ground in September 1960 as the playing field was required full time by the school.\n\"Westminster Road\".\nFollowing being asked to leave Manor Road, Brackley Cricket Club found its new home at Westminster Road, which was leased from Brackley Borough Council on 20 May 1961. Brackley CC continue to call Westminster Road home to this day.\nNorthamptonshire Cricket Club matches.\nAt Brackley Cricket Club's annual dinner in 1952, then Northamptonshire captain Freddie Brown promised to bring county Second XI cricket to Brackley, and this he did as Manor Road played host to Northants Second XI fixtures between 1954 and 1955. Various benefit matches were hosted in Brackley too, which were well supported.\nIn July 1971, however, Brackley hosted its first Northamptonshire First XI game versus Gloucestershire in the John Player League. Spectators took their seats on straw bales around the ground as they watched Gloucestershire (including Mike Procter) beat Northants in a tightly contested match. Sussex were scheduled to visit Westminster Road in 1972, but poor weather meant the game was to be abandoned before a ball could be bowled. Brackley were then scheduled to host the lucrative match versus Kent in 1973, which could bring any number of cricket stars to the ground, including Brian Luckhurst, Asif Iqbal, Alan Knott and Derek Underwood. Northamptonshire were on the receiving end of a rather heavy loss which is still, to this day, the county's second-heaviest defeat by runs in a List A competition. Northants hosted Somerset in 1974 (when they were beaten again), as spectators from the town were treated to a century from Peter Denning, but also a brisk 35 from Viv Richards, who was 22 at the time and playing his first season of county cricket, as well as a 4 wicket haul from Bob Clapp. The final Northants match to be played at Westminster Road was in 1975, when Northants hosted Nottinghamshire. The hosts had better fortunes and won by six wickets."

In the 1970s, it was home to the LPGA Tour's Patty Berg Classic.\nHistory.\nKeller Golf Course opened in 1929. It was designed by Paul Coates, a Ramsey County civil engineer, who reportedly visited some of America's great golf courses to learn the basics of course architecture. The original clubhouse was designed by architect Cap Wigington.\nIn October, 2012, The course was closed for major renovations under the direction of architect Richard Mandell, and reopened in July, 2014. The course's original layout was retained but the fairways were converted to bent grass, and all of the greens and bunkers were replaced and brought up to modern standards. Mandell's work was recognized by \"Golf\" magazine as the \"Best Municipal Renovation\" of 2014. Additionally, the clubhouse and pro shop were demolished and replaced with new buildings."

A downloadable demo was released on January 10 for both platforms. It is the sequel to \"Grand Slam Tennis\".\nGameplay.\nThe game features a control scheme, dubbed Total Racquet Control, giving players control of each shot with the right analog stick, with precision, accuracy, and power. The game features all four Grand Slams, including Wimbledon. The game supports the PlayStation Move, but does not support Kinect.\nThe game features a Career mode in which players create their own tennis player and take them through 10 years of tournaments, with the aim of being ranked number 1. Before each Grand Slam players have the opportunity to take part in training, an exhibition match or a minor tournament. Players earn points from matches and these points accumulate to increase the players ranking.\nThe game also features an ESPN Grand Slam Classics mode in which players relive classic moments from Grand Slam tournaments from the 1980s to the 2000s and Fantasy matches.\nAlthough an online pass code is included in the game, EA confirmed that it would not be required to access online multiplayer due to \"technical issues with the registration system\".\nPat Cash provides commentary continuing his role from the prequel and analysis is provided by John McEnroe. The in-game music is provided by DJ Paul van Dyk, who wrote and produced all the tracks in the game.\nReception.\n\"Grand Slam Tennis 2\" received \"average\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The game was praised for its presentation, HD graphics and control system, but was criticized mainly for its difficulty-changing career mode. New Game Network said that \"GST2 has solid ball-thwacking mechanics and some killer drop shots, but in other areas the game feels a distant second best to \"Virtua Tennis 4\"\". In Japan, where the PlayStation 3 version was ported for release on April 12, 2012, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of three sevens and one eight for a total of 29 out of 40."

It is part of the \"RealSports\" series of games.\nGameplay.\nBefore the game starts, players have to name their character, a first for an Atari 2600 game, and choose between one and two player mode and the two pre-set difficulty levels (\"slow\" and \"fast\").\nIn the game, one player with a blue shirt plays tennis against an AI enemy portrayed by a non-player character (NPC) with a red shirt. In the two-player mode, one player competes against another player local. Players can move vertically and horizontally on the map. With the one button on the Atari 2600 controller, players make the serve. Every further shot is automatic if the ball has physical contact with the player. For every ball that falls on the opposing playing field, players get 15 points which they can see at the top part of the screen. After they reached 30 points, they only get 10 points for each other ball. After 40 points, they won one round. The number of rounds won goes up to 6. After winning 6 rounds, a new pile is opened at the top part of the screen which again goes up to 6. The first player who won two piles of 6 rounds wins the game.\nDevelopment.\nThe 2600 version's programmer is unknown, while the 5200 and Atari 8-bit family versions were coded by W Sean Hennessy. Atari's Director of Software George Kiss assigned the project to Hennessey knowing that he's a tennis fan. He did the 5200 version first and then ported the game to the Atari 8-bit family of home computers later. The game was so well received that Hennessey could choose his next project, which was uncommon among new Atari employees.\nThe ball is larger in the NTSC version than the PAL version. The Atari 5200 version is slower than the Atari 2600 version.\nLegacy.\nThe intellectual property rights for the game passed to Hasbro Interactive and were subsequently bought by Infogrames in 2001, which was subsequently renamed Atari SA. In 2018 the game was re-released by AtGames on their \"Flashback portable\" platform."

The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\". Steals are a relatively new statistic in college basketball, having only become an official statistic beginning with the 1985–86 season. Therefore, Robert Morris's Chipper Harris, who amassed 450 steals during his career between 1980 and 1984, is not officially recognized in the all-time ranks.\nThe all-time Division I steals leader is Jacob Gilyard of Richmond.

The game attracted 8,000 people and was the first cricket match to be televised in colour by the BBC.\nThe Surrey Cricket Board played 2 List-A matches at the ground, the first of which came against Norfolk in the 1999 NatWest Trophy. Their second List-A match at the ground came in the 2001 Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Trophy against Huntingdonshire.\nToday Cheam Cricket Club is an club in Surrey and has produced several first class and international players such as Mark Butcher, Alisdair Brown, Michael Burgess and Michael Carberry. For many years Cheam CC played in the Premier or Div 1 of the Surrey Championship. Internal issues led to a walk out of the 1st XI in the early 2000s with many players migrating to neighbouring clubs in Sutton and Ashtead. The club suffered hugely and had several relegations however the club recorded 4 promotions in 2019 and now plays in Div 3 of the Surrey Championship and has a thriving youth section."

Ocean View Little League of Huntington Beach, California, defeated Hamamatsu Minami Little League of Hamamatsu City, Japan, in the championship game. Nick Pratto hit an RBI single to clinch the title for Ocean View.\nTournament changes.\nOn June 16, 2011, Little League announced that it was modifying the double-elimination format that was first used in the previous year's tournament. The format of four pools consisting of four teams in each pool, a format that had been used since the tournament expanded to 16 teams in 2001, was eliminated. Instead, the eight teams from the United States were placed into one bracket, and the eight International teams into another bracket. The tournament remained double-elimination until the United States and International championship games, where it became single-elimination.\nLittle League International renewed deals with uniform suppliers Russell Athletic and New Era Caps. As part of the deal, regions had new color schemes this year.\nResults.\nCrossover games.\nTeams that lost their first two games played a crossover game against a team from the other side of the bracket that also lost its first two games. These games were labeled Game A and Game B. This provided teams who were already eliminated the opportunity to play a third game.\nWorld Championship.\nThe consolation game between Montana and Mexico was cancelled due to the expected arrival of Hurricane Irene.\nMiddle East-Africa qualification.\nKampala, Uganda defeated Dhahran, Saudi Arabia in the Middle East-Africa Region Final but the Ugandan team was denied visas by the State Department.

Prior to 2012, the annual tournament is held over two days, typically on a weekend in June, before the highest category tournament was reorganized as the Sevens Grand Prix Series, modeled after the format of the World Rugby Sevens Series. The tournaments are sanctioned and sponsored by Rugby Europe.\nHistory.\nRugby sevens — also known as 7-a-side, or 7s — is a short form of the sport of rugby union that was first played in 1883. The first (men's) internationals took place in 1973. As women's rugby union developed in the 1960s and 1970s the format became very popular as it allowed games, and entire leagues, to be developed in countries even when player numbers were small, and it remains the main form the women's game is played in most parts of the world.\nHowever, although the first women's international rugby union 15-a-side test match took place in 1982, it was not until 1997 before the first women's international 7s tournaments were played, when the 1997 Hong Kong Sevens included a women's tournament for the first time. Over the next decade the number of tournaments grew, with almost every region developing regular championship competitions. This reached its zenith with 2009's inaugural women's tournament for the Rugby World Cup Sevens, shortly followed by the announcement that women's rugby sevens will be included in the Olympics from 2016.\nThe first official regional 7s championship for international women's teams from European was the European Women's Sevens Championship held in 2003 in Lunel, France. Since then, the regional 7s championships have periodically served as pre-qualifying competitions for the Rugby 7s World Cup, or other sevens tournaments.\nTournaments.\nThe following are details of all regional women's international championships played in Europe, listed chronologically with the earliest first, with all result details, where known (included are the FIRA–AER Women's Sevens and other official regional championships, e.g. the Europe Emerging Nations tournaments).\nChampionship Series.\nTeam records for Championship Series"

It included a women's draw until 1974 when Linda Lewis won the last ladies title. Subsequently, it became a men-only event and integrated into the ATP's professional tennis circuit. The inaugural edition of the event, known as the Pacific Southwest Championships, was organized by Perry T. Jones and held at the Los Angeles Tennis Club (LATC) starting in October 1927. Bill Tilden and Kea Bouman were the first singles champions. The tournament quickly became a prestigious event on the tennis calendar.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was usually held in September and hosted the top men (and until 1975, women) in the world. Tournament winners from its beginning in 1927 until 1967 included most of the world's No. 1 tennis players: Bill Tilden, Ellsworth Vines, Don Budge, Fred Perry, Jack Kramer, Pancho Gonzales and amateur champions Roy Emerson and Barry MacKay. In the open era the event was known by various (sponsored) names including \"Farmers Classic\", \"Countrywide Classic\", \"Los Angeles Tennis Open\", \"Pacific South West Open\" and \"Jack Kramer Open\". Jack Kramer became the tournament director in 1970 when Jones retired. In the open era, the tournament was won by Rod Laver twice, a second and third time by Gonzales, Stan Smith, Arthur Ashe, Jimmy Connors, John McEnroe, Pete Sampras, Richard Krajicek, and Andre Agassi. In doubles, Bob and Mike Bryan won a record six titles.\nFrom 1975 to 1979 the tournament was played indoors at the Pauley Pavilion.

In its last years it was an ATP World Tour 250 series tournament on the ATP Tour and had a 28-player singles draw and 16-team doubles draw. The tournament, with prize money of $557,550 in 2012, was one of the events included in the US Open Series.

        "text": "NCAA Division I independent schools are teams that compete in NCAA ice hockey but are not members of a conference. There are several current schools who, at one time or another, competed as Division I independents.\nCurrent independent programs.\nMen.\nAlaska played infrequently as an independent program prior to 1985. It returned to independent status after the Great West Hockey Conference dissolved in 1988 and then joined the CCHA in 1995. The team was one of two final members of the men's division of the WCHA in 2021 and formally dissolved the men's side of the conference in 2021 (the WCHA remains in operation as a women-only league).\nAlaska-Anchorage first moved to D1 status in hockey in 1984, and played its first couple years as an independent before joining the newly founded GWHC alongside the Nanooks. After it dissolved, the Seawolves also played as an independent before joining the WCHA in 1994, around the same time Alaska joined the nearby CCHA. In 2020, the University of Alaska announced that UAA hockey would be cut after the 2020-21 season due to a reduction in state funding unless the program could raise 3 million dollars, and the program went on hiatus that year while its future was uncertain. Ultimately, the program was saved, and it returned to play in the 2022-23 season as an independent, following the dissolution of the men's side of its former conference, the WCHA.\nThe Sun Devils moved up from club hockey in the ACHA to full varsity status. Arizona State began playing a full Division I schedule in 2016–17.\nThe LIU Sharks launched their men's program for the 2020–21 season, a year after starting a women's ice hockey program.\nWith the 2020–21 season dramatically impacted by COVID-19, both Arizona State and LIU were in scheduling alliances with Division I conferences for that season, respectively with the Big Ten Conference and Atlantic Hockey.\nIn 2021–22, Lindenwood fielded two separate men's club teams, each playing at a different level of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), which governs the sport at club level. On March 23, 2022, Lindenwood announced that it would launch a Division I men's varsity program starting in the 2022–23 season, while maintaining its ACHA program. This announcement came shortly after the school announced it was starting a transition from Division II to Division I in July 2022, joining the non-hockey Ohio Valley Conference.\nOn April 5, 2022, Stonehill, then a member of the D-II Northeast-10 Conference (NE-10), announced it was joining the Northeast Conference (which also does not sponsor ice hockey) that July, starting its own transition to D-I. Before this announcement, Stonehill had been one of seven NE-10 members that played men's ice hockey under Division II regulations, despite the NCAA not sponsoring a championship event at that level. (All other D-II schools with varsity men's ice hockey play under D-I regulations.)\nOn July 5, 2023, the National Collegiate Hockey Conference announced that Arizona State would join the conference beginning with the 2024-25 season.\nWomen.\nNo women's program has competed as an independent in the National Collegiate division of women's ice hockey, the de facto equivalent of Division I in that sport, since the 2018–19 season. The NCAA has never sponsored a Division II championship in the sport, although it does sponsor a Division III championship.\nFive schools competed as independents in the 2018–19 season, all participating in the nascent New England Women's Hockey Alliance (NEWHA), which had originally been established in 2017 as a scheduling alliance among all of the then-current National Collegiate independents. The NEWHA initially included six schools, but Holy Cross left after the inaugural 2017–18 NEWHA season to join Hockey East. The NEWHA officially organized as a conference in advance of the 2018–19 season, but was not officially recognized by the NCAA as a Division I league until the 2019–20 season, by which time the newly launched LIU program had joined as the sixth member.\nThe newest National Collegiate hockey school is Assumption, which joined the NEWHA for administrative purposes in 2022 but did not start conference play until launching its varsity team a year later. Also, Robert Morris, which had dropped the sport after the 2020–21 season due to COVID-19 impacts, resumed play in 2023–24, returning to its previous conference of College Hockey America."

        "text": "George Thomas Ford (born 16 March 1993) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a fly-half for Premiership Rugby club Sale Sharks and the England national team.\nFord burst onto the scene in 2009 as the youngest player to make his professional debut for the Leicester Tigers at just 16 years old. His illustrious career includes five Premiership finals, securing titles in 2013 and 2022. Ford made his mark on the international stage, earning his first cap for England during the 2014 Six Nations Championship against Wales. Additionally, his contributions to three Rugby World Cup campaigns and the recognition as the World Rugby Junior Player of the Year in 2011 further highlight his exceptional talent and success in the sport.\nEarly life.\nFord was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, he is the son of Rugby League legend Mike Ford. Ford played rugby league from age five at Saddleworth Rangers and Waterhead and as a young teenager played in the academies at both Wigan Warriors and Bradford Bulls. It was thought that he would go on to have a career in rugby league however he started playing rugby union aged 11 at Rishworth School and played for Leeds Carnegie, before eventually joining Leicester at the age of 16 and subsequently signed professional forms with them. \nHe played for England Under 18s at just 15 years of age. Bobby Walsh, one of the under-age coaches at the time, remarked that he reminded him of a \"young Cian Harrington\" - another youth player who made the switch from league to union. He then went on to captain the team in 2009–10 before moving up to the Under-20s where he started every game in a Six Nations Grand Slam, contributing 76 points. Ford then helped England to the World Juniors Final in Italy in the summer of 2011.\nIn December 2009, Ford was nominated for the BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year. In October 2011, he became the first Englishman to win the title of World Rugby Junior Player of the Year, and also became the youngest-ever winner of the award.\nClub career.\nLeicester Tigers.\nOn 8 November 2009, Ford became the youngest rugby union player to make his professional debut in England, breaking the record of international teammate Owen Farrell, at just 16 years and 237 days old when Leicester played Leeds Tykes in the Anglo-Welsh Cup. His debut was doubly notable as his brother Joe was also starting at fly-half for Leeds that day.\nOn 27 November 2010, Ford made his Premiership debut, coming off the bench in a 44–19 victory over Newcastle Falcons to become the third youngest player in Premiership history, he has since dropped to fifth youngest. In September 2011, he made his first Premiership start in a 30–28 defeat to Exeter Chiefs, becoming the youngest player to start a Premiership match at fly half. In January 2012, he was loaned out to Leeds Carnegie for a short period, but returned to make his Heineken Cup debut, scoring his first Leicester try in the defeat of Aironi.\nOn 18 March 2012 - two days after his 19th birthday - he won his first trophy for Leicester. He started in the Anglo-Welsh Cup semi-finals and final, winning Man of the Match in Leicester's semi-final win over Bath and scoring 16 points in the final as Tigers triumphed over local rivals Northampton Saints.\nOn 12 May 2012, Ford put in another impressive performance in a semi-final. A late replacement for the injured Toby Flood, he guided Leicester Tigers to the Premiership final, with a 14-point haul in the 24–15 semi-final victory over Saracens. He retained the starting spot for the final, but his 13-point haul with the boot was not enough as Leicester lost out 30–23 to Harlequins.\nIn January 2013, it was announced that he would be leaving Leicester Tigers at the end of the season to join Bath Rugby, where his father Mike Ford was at the time assistant coach. Despite this, he continued to play a full part in Leicester Tigers' season, which culminated in the club's 10th Premiership title. Ford came off the bench in the first half of the Premiership final to replace the injured Toby Flood, and scored 12 points in Leicester's 37–17 win over Northampton Saints.\nIn all, Ford played 40 matches for Leicester Tigers, scoring 253 points and winning two trophies.\nBath.\nOn 23 January 2013, it was announced that Ford was to leave Tigers at the end of the season, to join Bath Rugby. On 22 May 2014, Ford started for the Bath side that lost to Northampton in the final of the European Challenge Cup at Cardiff Arms Park. The following season Ford scored 11 points in the 2015 Premiership final as Bath were defeated 16-28 by Saracens to finish runners up.\nAfter his father Mike was sacked as head coach, Ford was linked with a move away from the club and in December 2016 Sale Sharks Director of Rugby Steve Diamond confirmed his interest in Ford.\nReturn to Leicester.\nOn 14 February 2017, it was announced that Ford would be moving to former club Leicester Tigers as part of a swap deal with Freddie Burns, at the end of the season.\nOn 2 January 2022, Ford started his 100th game for Leicester across his two spells, he scored nine points in a win against Newcastle Falcons.\nFord was named as the Premiership's player of the month for December 2021. In Leicester's Premiership semi-final against Northampton Saints, Ford inspired the victory scoring a \"full house\" with a try, conversion, penalty and drop goal for 22 points in a 27-13 win. Ford started the 2022 Premiership Rugby final, but suffered an early injury and was substituted in the 23rd minute, as Tigers beat Saracens 15-12.\nSale Sharks.\nOn 17 November 2021, Leicester announced that Ford would be leaving the club at the end of the 2021–22 season to join Premiership rivals Sale Sharks. Due to a ruptured Achilles suffered in his final game for Leicester, Ford was unable to feature for Sale until February 2023. He made his debut for Sale in the Premiership Rugby Cup against Bristol Bears. Ford started the 2022–23 Premiership Rugby semi-final against his former club Leicester Tigers kicking 11 points in a 21–13 victory, which took Sale to their first Premiership Final in 16 seasons.\nInternational career.\nEngland U18.\nFord started playing for England U18s when he was 15 years old. He later became captain of the team. Ford was a regular in the successful England U18 side from 2008 to 2010. He was first selected for the 2008 end-of-season tour to Argentina at the age of just 15, and was first choice fly-half for the 2009 and 2010 Six Nations and for the 2009 tour to South Africa. He missed the 2010 tour to South Africa due to club commitments and in his absence the team's three year, 25-game winning run came to an end with a 23–17 defeat to the hosts.\nEngland U20.\nAt the start of the 2010–11 season, still aged just 17, Ford was called into the England U20 squad for the 2011 campaign. He made his debut at fly-half in the opening U20 Six Nations game against Wales, scoring six points in England's 26–20 victory. He went on to start every game in the tournament, winning Man of the Match awards in the victories over France, Scotland and Ireland as England won the Grand Slam.\nDespite being the youngest player competing at the 2011 U20 Junior World Cup, he remained first-choice fly-half as England finished in second place following victories over Ireland, Scotland, South Africa and France. The 33–22 loss to New Zealand in the final was the first time that Ford had tasted defeat with an England team since March 2008, when he was playing for the U16s. Such was the standard of his performances, however, that he won the World Rugby Junior Player of the Year award, beating New Zealanders Sam Cane and Luke Whitelock who were also shortlisted.\nIn 2012, Ford was made captain of the U20 side, and led England to an impressive 59–3 victory over Scotland in their opening Six Nations match. However, due to club commitments, that was the only match he played in the 2012 Six Nations. Ford was also left out of the squad for the 2012 Junior Rugby World Cup in order to have a full pre-season programme with Leicester.\nDespite still being eligible for the U20s in 2013, Ford was instead promoted into the England Saxons when the Elite Player Squad was named at the start of the 2012–13 season.\nEngland.\nFord made his England debut as a replacement against Wales in the penultimate round of the 2014 Six Nations Championship as England claimed their first triple crown in over a decade. The following weekend saw him make a 10 minute appearance against Italy in which he made a good break to set up a try for Chris Robshaw as England finished runners up.\nOn 6 February 2015, he was man-of-the-match in England's win over Wales in the opening match of the 2015 Six Nations. He scored his first International try in the penultimate round against Scotland. In the final game of the tournament, he scored 25 points including a try in England's thrilling 55–35 win over France as they finished runners up again.\nFord was named in Stuart Lancaster's 31-man squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. He was picked to start in the tournament opener against Fiji as England won 35–11, however, one week later, Ford was dropped in favour of childhood friend Owen Farrell. England were subsequently knocked out in the pool stage, becoming the second after Wales, as host nation to fail to qualify for the knock-out rounds of their own tournament. The 1991 tournament was jointly hosted between Wales, England, Scotland, Ireland and France.\nFollowing the departure of Head Coach Stuart Lancaster, Ford was selected in new coach Eddie Jones' first squad for the 2016 Six Nations Championship. He scored a try against Italy and was the starting fly-half as England secured their first grand slam since 2003. Later that year he was part of the side that won 3-0 on their summer tour of Australia and in the 2016 Autumn Internationals scored a try against South Africa as England defeated the Springboks for the first time in a decade.\nFord was also a member of the side that retained their title during the 2017 Six Nations Championship, missing out on a consecutive grand slam with defeat in the final game away to Ireland which also brought an end to a record equalling 18 successive Test victories. Ford missed out on the 2017 Lions tour and instead was a member of the side that won 2-0 on their tour of Argentina, scoring a try in the first match. On 18 October 2018, Ford played his 50th test for England against Japan. Ford also captained the team that day, which was his first test as captain.\nFord was included in the squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and scored tries in pool stage games against the United States and Argentina. He was dropped to the bench for the quarter-final against Australia but returned to the starting lineup for the semi-final against New Zealand and defeat in the final against South Africa as England finished runners up.\nAfter the World Cup, he scored a try against Ireland in the 2020 Six Nations Championship which England went on to win. Later that year Ford started for England as they defeated France in extra-time to win the Autumn Nations Cup.\nDuring the 2023 Rugby World Cup in France, Ford scored all of England's 27 points, kicking 6 for 6 on penalties, as well as converting 3 drop goals by half time against Argentina on 9 September. England won 27-10 at the end of the match.\nPersonal life.\nFord is the son of former England defence coach Mike Ford. His older brother Joe was also a professional rugby player.\nFord had tied the knot with partner, Atdhetare Hoxha in a ceremony on 15 August 2022. Atdhetare’s family own and run the restaurant, Mazzo, in Royton, Oldham."

One reviewer wrote: \"The game's largely meant for casual users, and it's easy to break out a lot of different tricks. The story setup, which has you saving a city from evil with the power of your skateboard, is pretty funny. You have a lot of board and hat selections and so on when making a character, but I would have liked a few more facial types to choose from.\" Another wrote, \"The 'shaping' system was obviously pretty ambitious on the developer's part, but actually play it, and it doesn't really make much of a difference in gameplay. I wish there was more flash, or speed, or something to differentiate this from other games.\""

        "text": "Europe first participated in the Little League World Series in . Teams from Europe were given a berth in the LLWS each year between 1960 and 2000 (with the exception of the temporary ban of international teams in ). In 2001, the region was split into two co-terminus regions: Europe (later EMEA) Region and Transatlantic Region. The Europe Region comprised mostly native European teams while the Transatlantic Region comprised mostly American expatriates. This distinction was eliminated in 2008; from 2008 to 2012, teams made up of either native Europeans or American expatriates were eligible to qualify from the Europe Region.\nStarting with the 2013 LLWS, the region was renamed the Europe and Africa Region. African countries were added as a result of a major reorganization of the international (non–U.S.) regions. This move was triggered by Little League's announcement that Australia would receive its own LLWS berth starting in 2013. Two Middle Eastern countries, Israel and Turkey, have been part of European regions since they instituted Little League programs, as they were then members of the European zone of the International Baseball Federation and remain in the same zone under baseball's modern international governing body, the World Baseball Softball Confederation. Israel and Turkey have stayed in the renamed Europe and Africa Region to this day.\nNo team from the European region has ever reached the final of the Little League World Series. The best finishes for a European team occurred in , and , when European teams reached the semifinals. Aviano, Italy, made it that far — in the 8-team format — in 1979. Kaiserslautern, Germany and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia made the International final in back-to-back years in 1993 and 1994.\nEurope/Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa Region (2001–2007).\nIn 2001, with the LLWS expanding to sixteen teams, the European region split into two co-terminous regions. The Europe region consisted of teams that were primarily made up of players native to each country; no team could have more than three players from the United States, Canada, or Japan. The Europe region was named the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region between 2004 and 2007; however, no Middle Eastern or African team participated in qualifiers for the EMEA Series berth (although Kenya sent a team to the European qualifier in 2001 and South Africa did the same in 2003). In 2008, Little League removed the native players rule and split the EMEA and Transatlantic region into the Europe and Middle East-Africa regions. The following teams represented the European region after 2000:\nTransatlantic Region (2001–2007).\nThe Transatlantic region encompassed the same territory as the Europe/EMEA region, but consisted of teams that were made up of at least 51% American, Canadian, or Japanese citizens.\nRegional championship.\nBelow are the champions of the Transatlantic region, along with participants for each year.

The team that had the higher aggregate score over the two legs progressed to the next round. If aggregate scores finish level, the away goals rule was applied, i.e. the team that scored more goals away from home over the two legs progressed. If away goals were also equal, then 30 minutes of extra time were played, divided into two 15-minute halves. The away goals rule was again applied after extra time, i.e. if there were goals scored during extra time and the aggregate score was still level, the visiting team qualified by more away goals scored. If no goals were scored during extra time, the tie was decided by a penalty shoot-out. In the final, the tie was played as a single match. If scores were level at the end of normal time in the final, extra time was played, followed by penalties if scores remained tied.\nIn the draw for the round of 16, each of the eight group winners was drawn against a second-place team, with the group winners hosting the second leg. Teams from the same group or the same association were not allowed to be drawn against each other.

From 1881 to 1896 it was the home ground of Lord Sheffield's XI, organised by Henry Holroyd, 3rd Earl of Sheffield, who in 1891 donated £150 to the New South Wales Cricket Association which was used to purchase a plate and establish the competition known as the Sheffield Shield. Cricket had been played at the ground for the previous 30 years before 1881, but these matches were unrecorded.\nThe first recorded match on the ground was in 1881, when Lord Sheffield's XI played Alfred Shaw's XI, which was also the first first-class match on the ground. From 1881 to 1896, Lord Sheffield's XI played 9 first-class matches, the last of which came against the touring Australians. During this match, 25,000 people were allowed to watch the match for free; Lord Sheffield never charged for people to come and watch matches at the ground.\nLord Sheffield had an octagonal pavilion constructed during 1881-1882, and later a separate ladies pavilion was built. Following Lord Sheffield's death in 1909, with him cricket largely died out at the estate. During World War I the ground was requisitioned for farming, wiping out the cricket ground. Subsequently trees were planted on the site, but most were blown down in the 1987 hurricane. In 2009, a new square was laid, a pavilion was built, and the outfield was restored in its parkland setting. The reopening of the ground was celebrated with a match between an Old England XI and a Lord Sheffield Australian XI. Today, the restored ground is the home of the Armadillos Cricket Club."

        "text": "A base on balls (BB), also known as a walk, occurs in baseball when a batter receives four pitches that the umpire calls \"balls\", and is in turn awarded first base without the possibility of being called out. The base on balls is defined in Section 2.00 of baseball's Official Rules, and further detail is given in 6.08(a). It is, however, considered a faux pas for a professional player to actually walk to first base; the batter-runner and any advancing runners normally jog on such a play.\nThis is a list of top 100 Major League Baseball pitchers who have allowed the most walks of all time. Nolan Ryan holds the record for walking the most batters in a career with 2,795. Ryan is the only pitcher in MLB history to walk more than 2,000 batters."

Armenia had its own representative team within the USSR, although it was not considered to be a proper national side. Armenian clubs including Yerevan Dinamo RC and Yerevan Spartak RC played in the top division of Soviet Championship and Soviet Cup.

He played professional football for the Buffalo Bills of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) from 1947 to 1949 and for the San Francisco 49ers of the AAFC in 1949. He also played five years in the Canadian Football League (CFL) for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats (1950–1951) and Toronto Argonauts (1952–1954).\nCollege football.\nA native of Kansas City, Missouri, Carpenter began his college football career at the University of Missouri. He played football for the Missouri Tigers in 1942.\nHe also played for the United States Marine Corps.\nCarpenter enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1946 and won the starting right tackle position on Fritz Crisler's 1946 Michigan Wolverines football team that finished the season with a record of 6-2-1, ranked No. 6 in the final AP poll. At the end of the 1946 season, Carpenter was selected as an All-Big Nine Conference player by the United Press. Carpenter, Alex Agase and Earl Banks received the most votes among the lineman. The \"United Press\" noted at the time: \"Carpenter was stamped by numerous scouts as the ideal tackle.\"\nProfessional football.\nIn January 1947, Carpenter announced that he intended to withdraw from school at the end of the semester to play professional football.\nCarpenter had been drafted by the Chicago Cardinals in the 1944 NFL Draft, but he opted instead to play in the new All-America Football Conference. He initially signed with the New York Yankees, but was traded to the Cleveland Browns and then in late August 1947 to the Buffalo Bills.\nCarpenter played for the Bills from 1947 to 1949. He was traded to the San Francisco 49ers during the 1949 AAFC season and finished the season there.\nThe AAFC folded after the 1949 season, and Carpenter signed to play for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League in 1950. His signing led one Canadian sports columnist to write: \"The advance notices indicate that local football fans will see a real lineman when Jack Carpenter shows here with the Tiger-Cats on Saturday.\" He played for the Tiger-Cats in 1950 and 1951.\nCarpenter played for the Toronto Argonauts from 1952 to 1954. During the 1954, he also served as the Argonauts' line coach and was singled out by head coach Frank Clair as \"the pillar of strength on the Argos' front wall.\"\nLater years.\nAfter retiring from football, Carpenter opened Jack Carpenter's Hotel, a popular restaurant, bar and bowling alley in South Wales, New York. He was a resident of Honolulu, Hawaii in his later years. After a long illness, he died in 2005 at age 82 in a Honolulu nursing home."

The last game aired on September 23, 2009, as Rogers Sportsnet acquired the complete rights for the 2010 season.\nBlue Jays broadcasts were sponsored by Labatt from 1984-2000 and by Rogers from 2001-2009. Labatt also sponsored TSN's Expos broadcasts for a number of years."

        "text": "The 2010–11 Australian Baseball League season was the inaugural Australian Baseball League (ABL) season, and was held from 6 November 2010 to 13 February 2011. It came 12 years after the old Australian Baseball League ceased and is the successor of the mostly amateur Claxton Shield competition that has been played since 1934. The season consisted of six teams competing in a 40-game schedule, followed by a three-round finals series to determine the ABL champion.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the Sydney Blue Sox, Perth Heat, Adelaide Bite and Melbourne Aces progressed to the finals series, while the Brisbane Bandits and Canberra Cavalry were only eliminated from contention on the final day of the season. Both Melbourne and Sydney were eliminated by Adelaide in the minor semi-final series and the preliminary final series, respectively. Perth became the inaugural ABL champions when they defeated Adelaide two games to one in the championship series.\nFormation.\nIn June 2009, it was announced that the rights to the Claxton Shield had been sold to a new Australian Baseball League, with ownership split between Major League Baseball's 75 percent share and the 25 percent share owned by the Australian Baseball Federation. The 2010 Claxton Shield tournament was considered preparation for the inaugural ABL season.\nAlthough initial reports suggested that between eight and ten teams would contest the first season, including the possibility of a team based in New Zealand, six teams representing Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney were announced in November 2009 as the foundation clubs.\nCompared to the previous season's Claxton Shield tournament, there were few structural changes to the competition. With the expansion from five to six teams, the need for teams to have a bye was eliminated, with all teams participating in games each round. The individual rounds were expanded from three to four games per round, resulting in an increase from 24 to 40 games per team for the season. The postseason was also expanded to include the top four teams, rather than only the top three.\nTeams.\nRosters.\nDuring the season each team made use of a 22-man active roster, drawn from 35-man squads announced on 28 October 2010.\nVenues.\nFour of the six teams used their existing venues from the Claxton Shield: the Adelaide Bite, Perth Heat and Sydney Blue Sox all used the same grounds used in the 2010 Claxton Shield by the respective state teams, and the Canberra Cavalry used the same venue used by Australia Provincial when they last contested the Claxton Shield in 2008: Narrabundah Ballpark.\nThe Melbourne Aces played at the Melbourne Showgrounds, after the Victorian state government announced a A$300,000 upgrade of the grounds. Similarly the Queensland state government announced a A$300,000 upgrade of the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for use by the Brisbane Bandits as their home field.\nRegular season.\nThe regular season was held from 6 November 2010 through to 22 January 2011. All six teams competed in a double round-robin format, playing each other team in two series of four games each, totalling 40 games played each. The top four teams progressed to the postseason. The winner of the championship series will be awarded the Claxton Shield.\nAt the end of the regular season, the Sydney Blue Sox finished in first place with a 24–15 win–loss record. Half a game behind Sydney were the Perth Heat in second place. The third place team was the Adelaide Bite a further game behind. The Melbourne Aces finished in fourth place six games behind the Blue Sox. The Brisbane Bandits and Canberra Cavalry, who played only 36 games due to 2010–11 Queensland floods, finished in fifth and sixth place, eight and a half and ten and a half games behind the leader respectively.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nOpening night.\nThe season started on 6 November 2010, when the Sydney Blue Sox hosted the Canberra Cavalry at Blacktown Olympic Park. The Blue Sox won the inaugural game of the league, defeating the Cavalry 1–0. In what was effectively a pitchers' duel, Blue Sox starting pitcher Chris Oxspring was the stand-out performer for the night, having scattered 3 hits and 1 walk over 6 innings and striking out 8. The Cavalry, however, opted to use several pitchers, each throwing two complete innings.\nSydney left fielder Tim Auty registered the league's first hit of the season in the bottom of the first with a line drive single to centre field. Canberra did not register a hit until the fourth inning to see their first baserunner when third baseman Kyu-Hyun Moon singled to right field.\nThe game had been scoreless through the first seven innings, despite Sydney loading the bases in the bottom of the sixth against reliever Lee Jung-Min: right fielder David Kandilas walked to lead off the inning, and was followed by third baseman Trent D'Antonio with a single to left field. Auty hit a sacrifice bunt to move both runners over, leading the Cavalry to intentionally walk centre fielder Mitch Dening. The Blue Sox were unable to capitalise on the opportunity, when designated hitter Patrick Maat struck out and catcher Andrew Graham grounded out.\nSydney scored the only run of the night in the eighth inning against reliever Heo Jun-Hyeok. With two out, Auty singled to left field for his second hit of the night, then stole second base. He was then driven in by Dening, who singled to centre field. Dening also stole second, but was stranded there at the end of the inning. In the top of the ninth, relievers Matthew Williams and Koo Dae-Sung combined to close the game out, earning a hold and save respectively.\nRound 1.\nThe Melbourne Aces played the Adelaide Bite at Coopers Stadium in Adelaide, the Perth Heat played against the Brisbane Bandits at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, and the Sydney Blue Sox and Canberra Cavalry continued their series at Blacktown Olympic Park for the first round of the season.\nAdelaide v Melbourne.\nThe Adelaide Bite won its opening game for the season, defeating the Melbourne Aces 9–1, in large part due to the Paul Mildren's pitching and Ben Wigmore's hitting. Mildren pitched 7 scoreless innings, allowing 6 hits and struck out 5, while Wigmore went 4–for–5 with a double, a home run and 5 runs batted in. Despite scoring first in the second inning through back-to-back doubles from Grant Karlsen and Itaru Hashimoto, the Aces lost the second game of the series 7–4. the Bite's starting pitcher Darren Fidge was once again the standout; he pitched 8 innings and allowed 3 runs on 3 hits and 3 walks, and struck out 7. Quincy Latimore went 4–for–8 over the two games of the doubleheader; he hit a 3-run home run in the first inning and took a catch at the left field wall in the fifth inning of game one to help Adelaide to a 13–2 win, then hit two more home runs in the second game where Adelaide won 8–3 to complete the series sweep.\nBrisbane v Perth.\nThe Brisbane Bandits and the Perth Heat opened their seasons in Brisbane. The ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Graeme Lloyd and caught by the Bandits' manager Dave Nilsson; the only all-Australian battery to appear in a Major League Baseball game and both Baseball Australia Hall of Fame inductees in their own right. Despite Robbie Widlansky's two extra base hits and his scoring two runs, Perth was unable to take the lead at any point in the game. Brisbane's Wade Dutton, Shuhei Fukuda, Alan Schoenberger, and Joel Naughton each had multi-hit games to help the Bandits to an 8–3 win. Widlansky was a key player for the Heat again in the second game, which Perth won 2–0, opening the scoring with a solo home run. Daniel Schmidt was the other key player; he was the starting pitcher and pitched 8 innings, allowing no runs on 5 hits and striking out 8 Bandits. Perth also won both games of the doubleheader—4–2 in the day game and 4–1 in the night game—to win its opening series. In the day game Brandon Dale went 3–for–4 with a double and a run batted in, and Luke Hughes went 1–for–2 scoring 2 runs, including scoring a run from his lead-off triple in the fifth inning. Heat pitchers Warwick Saupold, Tyler Anderson, Robert Sorensen, and Liam Hendriks combined to keep the Bandits to 1 run on 7 hits, striking out 11 Brisbane hitters.\nSydney v Canberra.\nSix days after the opening night of the season Sydney and Canberra continued their series at Blacktown Olympic Park. Three of the Blue Sox's key players from that opening night gave repeat performances to defeat the Cavalry 4–2: Chris Oxspring was the starting pitcher for Sydney and pitched 8 innings, having allowed 2 runs on 4 hits and struck out 7 to earn the win; Koo Dae-Sung retired the three Cavalry hitters he faced for a scoreless ninth inning to earn the save; Mitch Dening hit a ground rule double with the bases loaded to drive in the go-ahead run in the bottom of the fifth inning. In the first game of the season to be called early as a result of the league's run differential rule, Sydney comfortably beat Canberra 13–3. Though the Blue Sox combined to hit 7–for–17 with runners in scoring position and 7 runs driven in with two out, they were aided by 2 wild pitches by Cavalry pitchers, 3 passed balls by catcher Michael Collins, and 4 errors in the field, resulting in only 3 of the 13 runs scored by the Blue Sox being earned. Alex Johnson's 3-run home run in the bottom of the seventh inning was the difference in the final game of the series, helping Sydney to a 7–5 win and to sweep Canberra 4–0 in the series.\nRound 2.\nThe Perth Heat had their home opening series, hosting the Adelaide Bite at Baseball Park as did Canberra Cavalry in facing the Melbourne Aces at Narrabundah Ballpark. The Brisbane Bandits continued their homestand, playing the Sydney Blue Sox at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground.\nPerth v Adelaide.\nIn their first game at home for the season, Perth defeated Adelaide 4–2. Matt Kennelly and Luke Hughes each hit home runs in the fourth and fifth innings respectively to lead the Heat offence. Despite home runs from Evan McArthur and Ronnie Welty, Adelaide were able to square the series by winning 7–3 in the second game; James McOwen homered as part of the Bite's 6-run sixth inning, while Quincy Latimore hit his 4th home run of the season in the seventh. Tied at 4–4 at the end of nine innings, game three went into extra innings. Ronnie Welty produced a walk-off home run in the bottom of the twelfth inning; his second home run in as many days to give the Heat a 6–4 win. The final game of the series was won by Adelaide 4–3. Quincy Latimore hit an RBI-double in the top of the ninth inning to put the Bite in front. In trying to score the tying run, Matt Kennelly was thrown out at home plate by James McOwen in center field for the final out of the game.\nRound 3.\nThe third round of the season had the same match-ups of teams from the previous round, but with a switch of home and away teams: the Adelaide Bite hosted the Perth Heat at Coopers Stadium, the Melbourne Aces had their home opener against the Canberra Cavalry at the Melbourne Showgrounds, and the Sydney Blue Sox faced the Brisbane Bandits at Blacktown Olympic Park.\nMelbourne v Canberra.\nThe Melbourne Aces were scheduled to open their first home series of the season on Friday, 26 November but had to wait for two days and three games to be rained out. As a result, the series was shortened to two 7 inning games played on Sunday, 28 November. In the first game the Aces scored all their runs from four home runs, including 2-run shots from Scott Wearne (2–for–3) in the first inning and Grant Karlsen (2–for–3 with a double) in the fourth, allowing Melbourne to win 6–2. Wearne hit another first-inning home run in the second game, but the highlight—also in the first inning—of the game was a grand slam from Takahiro Ijyuin. Both home runs helped to set up a comfortable 10–2 win for the Aces to complete a sweep of the shortened series.\nRound 4.\nThe Canberra Cavalry returned to the Narrabundah Ballpark to host the Adelaide Bite. The Perth Heat also returned to their home ground at Baseball Park to face the Brisbane Bandits, completing their season series. The Sydney Blue Sox completed their homestand against the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park.\nCanberra v Adelaide.\nAs was the case for Canberra's previous series in Melbourne, the opening game of the series was called off because of the rain before a pitch was thrown. The game was rescheduled for the following day as part of a doubleheader.\nPerth v Brisbane.\nBrisbane dominated Perth in the first game of the series to win in 8–1. Alan Schoenberger led the offence for the Bandits, hitting 3–for–4 with a double and a run batted in, as did Shuhei Fukuda with a home run in the first at bat of the game. Hiroki Yamada was credited with the win on the mound, pitching for 7 innings, allowing 1 run on 5 hits, striking out 8.\nRound 5.\nThe Adelaide Bite completed their road trip, facing the Brisbane Bandits at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. The Perth Heat completed their homestand, playing the Canberra Cavalry at Baseball Park in Perth. The Melbourne Aces hosted the Sydney Blue Sox for the final games of their season series, including a makeup game from the previous round in Sydney.\nRound 6.\nThe Canberra Cavalry hosted the Perth Heat at Narrabundah Ballpark to complete their season series. The Sydney Blue Sox continued their road trip, facing the Adelaide Bite at Coopers Stadium. The Melbourne Aces completed their homestand with two back–to–back series at the Melbourne Showgrounds; two games against the Cavalry to make up for the games washed out in round 3,&lt;ref name=\"mel v can 3/4 report\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and four against the Brisbane Bandits as was originally scheduled.\nRound 7.\nThe Adelaide Bite completed their homestand by hosting the Canberra Cavalry for a five–game series, including a game postponed from round 4 due to wet weather, at Coopers Stadium, Adelaide. The Brisbane Bandits returned home to complete their season series against the Melbourne Aces at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground. The Perth Heat faced the Sydney Blue Sox for the first time in the season, playing at Baseball Park, Perth.\nRound 8.\nThe Melbourne Aces started their final homestand of the season at the Melbourne Showgrounds, facing the Adelaide Bite to complete their season series. The Canberra Cavalry and the Brisbane Bandits met for the first time, at Narrabundah Ballpark. The Sydney Blue Sox and Perth Heat completed their season series in back–to–back rounds, at Blacktown Olympic Park.\nMelbourne v Adelaide.\nThough Adelaide were able to put together an early 6-run lead through 3 home runs—including a grand slam from Tom Brice—Melbourne built their score throughout the game to win the opening game of the series 11–8. Of the Aces' 11 runs, 6 were unearned resulting from the Bite's 7 errors. In a reversal of form, Adelaide won the second game 6–3: two plays in the eighth inning that would otherwise have resulted in the third out were missed, each allowing the Bite to score an additional run to take the lead. For the third game in a row, the first team to score actually lost with Adelaide winning 9–2. Also continuing a trend in the series of runs scored from mistakes; both Bite runs scored in the sixth inning came when Melbourne's Shane Lindsay hit two consecutive hitters with bases loaded. Adelaide sealed the series win in the final game of the series, defeating Melbourne 10–7. The bite scored 5 runs without an out being recorded, including the first of two home runs from both Brandon Bantz and Tom Brice.\nCanberra v Brisbane.\nThe first game of the series was tied after the ninth inning, with both sides having had the lead at different points in the game. In the twelfth inning, Rory Rhodes for Brisbane and Donald Lutz for Canberra each hit solo home runs to keep the game tied. Alan Schoenberger scored the winning run in the thirteenth inning for the Bandits to win 7–6; Schoenberger doubled to centre field, was advanced by Wade Dutton's sacrifice bunt, and scored on Trent Baker's sacrifice fly. Alan Schoenberger opened the scoring in the second game with a grand slam in the second inning, while Michael Collins likewise ended the scoring with a grand slam in the eighth inning to give the win to Canberra 9–7. Despite Donald Lutz's third home run in as many games, Brisbane won the third game 16–9, after converting 7 hits and 5 walks in the first two innings into 11 runs. After the fourth game was tied in the bottom of the ninth inning through Tylor Prudhome's RBI-single broke the tie immediately in the tenth inning with an RBI-single from Trent Baker and a 3-run double from Josh Roberts to give Brisbane the win 8–4 and Canberra its first series loss at home.\nSydney v Perth.\nDespite having been swept at home by Sydney the previous weekend, and the addition of two Major Leaguers to the Blue Sox roster, Perth opened the series with a 3–1 win. A two-run single from Robbie Widlansky in the sixth inning proved the difference between the two teams. Allan de San Miguel's two 2-run home runs gave the Heat the lead in the second game and then provided insurance against a late Blue Sox rally, allowing Perth an 11–7 win. In his longest start of the season, Cole McCurry pitched 7 innings, allowing 3 earned runs on 6 hits, striking out 7 to get his first win in Perth's 4–3 victory, ensuring a Heat series win. Blue Sox manager Glenn Williams was ejected in the bottom of the sixth inning of the final game of the series, for arguing against two consecutive calls that according to him were \"questionable\". Had either call been made the other way, Sydney would likely have scored the first run of the game. Perth scored in each of the remaining innings to win the game 4–1, and complete the sweep of the series locking the season series at 4–4.\nRound 9.\nThe Sydney Blue Sox hosted their final home series of the season, against the Adelaide Bite at Blacktown Olympic Park, Sydney. The Melbourne Aces and Perth Heat started their season series at the Melbourne Showgrounds. The Brisbane Bandits were scheduled to host the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground, however the ABL postponed the series as a result of widespread flooding in South East Queensland. At the time, a decision had not been made as to whether the games would be rescheduled, however it was announced approximately one week later that the games would be rescheduled to the Monday and Tuesday immediately following round 10 in the form of two doubleheaders, but only if either team had a chance of making the playoffs, and only the games required for one of the teams to qualify.\nSydney v Adelaide.\nFor the third game in a row, Sydney allowed their opponents to get a 4-run lead before scoring themselves. However, in the first game of the series against Adelaide, the Blue Sox were able to snap a season-long 4-game losing streak through a walk off single from Trent Schmutter that drove in Mark Holland to win 5–4. Sydney regained first place in the league with a second consecutive win over the Bite 4–3. David Welch was credited with his 5th win of the season (6 innings pitched, 1 unearned run, 5 hits, 8 strikeouts), and Koo Dae-Sung earned his league leading 10th save (2  innings pitched, 1 unearned run, 2 hits, 3 strikeouts). For the second time in three games, Sydney recorded a walk-off win, beating Adelaide 6–5 in extra innings. Mark Holland's 2-run home run tied the game in the eighth inning, while in the tenth Alex Johnson doubled, then Michael Lysaught—pinch running for Johnson—scored on catcher Brandon Bantz's wild throw to third base to score the winning run. The Blue Sox secured the series sweep by beating the Bite 6–2 in their final home game of the regular season. The four runs driven in by Andrew Graham, Trent Schmutter and Alex Johnson in the fifth inning gave Sydney the lead for the rest of the game.\nRound 10.\nPerth v Melbourne.\nThe season length was similar to the 2010 Claxton Shield by spreading ten rounds over twelve weeks, playing only the season's first game in the first week and taking a week off for Christmas and Boxing Day. Six teams were involved, playing a four-game series every week totaling two series against each team, one at home and one away. In total, the schedule allowed for 40 regular season games per team before a four-team finals series. During the regular season, games were played Thursday to Sunday, varying depending on the series and team, with 18 games scheduled as doubleheaders on a Saturday. Doubleheaders were scheduled to have the first of the two games shortened to seven innings, with the second game using the full nine innings.\nOne of the regular season games resulted in a tie, which is unusual in baseball given the provision in the rules of the game to play extra innings to determine a winner. The game between the Sydney Blue Sox and the Melbourne Aces at Blacktown Olympic Park was the second game of a makeup doubleheader as a result of rain earlier that weekend washing out two games, and so had been shortened to seven innings. A rain delay during the first game of the day forced the second game to a later start. Under a provision in the ABL rules that is modeled on the International Baseball Federation's tiebreaker rule, in any extra inning that starts within an hour of the curfew time for the game—a time set to allow the visiting team time to meet travel schedules to return home at the end of a series—each team starts with runners at first and second base with nobody out. In addition, no new inning may start within 15 minutes of the curfew time. The game was scoreless at the end of the regulation seven innings, and was tied at 1–1 at the end of the eighth inning, which ended at the curfew time. Though the game was an official game, the result did not count towards the season standings.\nAll but 4 of the scheduled 120 games were played. The four games that were not played were the series scheduled between the Brisbane Bandits and the Canberra Cavalry at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground for the ninth round. Flooding in Brisbane had resulted in the Exhibition Ground being used as an evacuation centre for affected residents. Initially the ABL postponed the series, leaving a decision as to whether the games would be rescheduled to a later time. Just prior to the final round of scheduled games, it was announced that the games would go ahead in the form of two doubleheaders, but that only games that would affect the playoffs would be played. When Brisbane lost the final game of their series against the Adelaide Bite, both they and Canberra were eliminated from contention for the playoffs; hence, the makeup games were not played.\nThe Perth Heat and Sydney Blue Sox were the first teams to clinch positions in the finals series when Perth defeated the Melbourne Aces in the final game of their series in round 9. The Adelaide Bite were the next team to secure a place in the top four, after winning the third of an expanded six-game series against Brisbane. It was only on the final day of the regular season that Melbourne was able to claim the fourth finals position, and that the makeup of the semi-final series was decided: Sydney hosting Perth in the major semi-final series, and Adelaide hosting Melbourne in the minor semi-final series.\nPostseason.\nFormat.\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, the postseason involved the teams in a three-round structure. Each round consisted of a best-of-three-game series between the respective teams. The first- and second-place teams played each other in the major semi-final, the winner of which proceeded directly to the grand final and the loser to the preliminary final. The winner of the minor semi-final between the third- and fourth-place teams also qualified for the preliminary final, while the loser was eliminated. Likewise, the winner of the preliminary final qualified for the championship series, the loser being eliminated.\nAs in the finals series of previous Claxton Shield tournaments, though each series was hosted by a single team, the role of home team and away team alternated from game to game. For the second game in each series, the visiting team took the role of home team, fielding first, batting second, and wore their away uniform for the game.\nMajor semi-final series.\nThe Sydney Blue Sox hosted the Perth Heat in the major semi-final series at Blacktown Olympic Park. The Blue Sox and Heat split their season series 4–4. This included back-to-back sweeps for each team, with Perth winning the second of the two series, played in Sydney.\nMinor semi-final series.\nThe Adelaide Bite hosted the Melbourne Aces in the minor semi-final series at Coopers Stadium. The Bite won their season series against the Aces 7–1. Adelaide swept Melbourne 4–0 in the season opening series in Adelaide.\nBroadcasting.\nOn 25 January 2011, it was announced that Fox Sports would broadcast live coverage of the championship series. Warren Smith provided the play-by-play commentary, and was joined by Jon Deeble, manager of the Australia national baseball team, for colour commentary."

        "text": "Chris Bailey (born 29 April 1968) is a former professional tennis player (1987–1994), British No. 1 and ATP world No. 126 (1989), now a television sports commentator on tennis (BBC Sport 1995-2010, Sky Sports 1995–2007) and football (One since February 2010), and a real estate property consultant in Australia.\nEarly life.\nChris D. Bailey was born in Norwich in 1968 and grew up in Norfolk. In 1980 he won the under-12 British Championships, subsequently reaching the semi-finals in the under-16 (1984) and under-18 (1986) Championships. In 1985 he won the Cromer Lawn Tennis &amp; Squash Association tournament, which now incorporates the Men's Open Championship of Norfolk. In 1986 he reached the junior Wimbledon quarter-finals. His nickname is Bails.\nTennis career.\nChris became a professional tennis player at the age of 19, in June 1987, with a provisional ranking of 625 in the world, winning his first match against fellow Englishman and world No. 202 Steve Shaw at the Bristol grass court tournament, losing in the next round to former world No. 5 Henri Leconte. Later that month he reached the second round at Wimbledon, losing to future world No. 4 Brad Gilbert.\nIn June 1989, Chris reached the quarter-finals on grass at Queen's and in August the semi-finals on hard court at Livingston, New Jersey. These contributed to him reaching a career-high world ranking of No. 110 in October 1989, aged 21 years.\nHowever, after a first round defeat at Wimbledon in June 1990, he damaged a ligament during a practice session and underwent right knee surgery in July, not returning to the tour until almost a year later, in June 1991, at Queen's, but only playing in four other ATP tour tournaments during the rest of the year, and none until May 1992. His new coach from about this time was Nick Carr of New Zealand, later a coach of Martin Verkerk from 2001.\nAt Wimbledon in 1993, entering as a wildcard while only ranked world No. 263, Chris beat world No. 90 Patrick McEnroe (younger brother of John McEnroe) in straight sets in the first round. In the second round Chris took the 5th seed Goran Ivanišević (the previous year's runner-up and 2001 Champion) to 5 sets over 3 hours and 34 minutes until 8.40 pm on Centre Court in front of 14,000 supporters. Chris had won the first set 7–5 and third 7–6(3), with the second set also going to a tiebreak. In the fifth set Chris had match point at 6–5 on the Ivanisevic serve, with Goran serving a first serve fault and then a let (net cord), before serving a second serve ace to save the point, with Goran going on to finally win the set 9–7.\nAfter Wimbledon, in July 1993, Chris went on to win the Bristol grass court Challenger singles tournament, beating countryman Tim Henman (a future world No. 4) in the quarter-finals and Mark Knowles (a future world No. 1 doubles player) in the final. Chris also reached the final of the 1993 British Championships, losing to 6-times champion Jeremy Bates.\nIn July 1994, Chris reached the singles semi-finals at Bristol. In August 1994, Chris reached his highest doubles world ranking of No. 211, having won the Bronx, New York, Challenger doubles tournament with 27-year-old Swedish tennis partner Lars-Anders Wahlgren.\nA month later, Chris played his last professional match, at the relatively young age of 26, in September 1994, reaching the quarter-finals of the Singapore Challenger doubles event with Wahlgren. He was then ranked world No. 256 in singles, having reached as high as No. 110 in November 1993. Chris was subsequently forced to retire from professional tennis due to injury, after undergoing seven knee operations. He had a career singles win–loss record of 17–34 on the ATP World Tour &amp; Grand Slam circuit (doubles 3–15), with a 57–52 result on the singles ATP Challenger Tour, with total career prize money of $208,917. He competed in singles at 7 Wimbledon (1987–90, 1992–94) and 3 Australian (1988–89, 1993) Slams and also represented Great Britain in European and Davis Cup (twice in 1989) competitions.\nCommentating career.\nIn 1995 Chris went to work as a commentator and summariser on BBC TV's Wimbledon tennis coverage and for Sky TV Sports. He also worked as a freelance journalist and regularly commentated on tennis for Eurosport and BBC Radio (e.g. 5 Live). From 2002 until 2004 he was a presenter on Sky Sports News. In 2005 he commentated on his first Wimbledon singles final, with Tracy Austin and John McEnroe. He was also host of Sky Sports tennis Masters Series coverage, regularly appearing with fellow English tennis playing friends Mark Petchey and Barry Cowan. In about March 2007, Chris left Sky, with his host role being taken over by football commentator Marcus Buckland, but Chris continued to commentate annually for the BBC for various Grand Slam events until 2010, such as the Australian Open, having commentated on more than a dozen Wimbledons by 2010.\nFrom 8 February 2010 Chris has appeared as the host of the One HD weekly World football news program.\nProperty career.\nIn early 2007 Chris was thought to have moved to Florida to set up in the property market. However it was stated later in the year that he had moved to Australia. He was later appointed Senior Manager with CB Richard Ellis in Sydney, focusing on leasing and private client sales across the North Shore area. He is now a Director of GJS Property, formed in about 2005 by three ex-Knight Frank consultants, located beside the Sydney 2000 Olympics site, dealing with commercial property predominantly around the North Ryde area."

        "title": "Langston Golf Course",
        "text": "Langston Golf Course is an 18-hole golf course in Washington, D.C., established in 1939. It was named for John Mercer Langston, an African American who was the first dean of the Howard University School of Law, the first president of Virginia Normal and Collegiate Institute (now Virginia State University), and the first African American elected to the United States Congress from Virginia. It was the second racially desegregated golf course in the District of Columbia, and in 1991 its first nine holes were added to the National Register of Historic Places.\nThe course's official address is 2600 Benning Road NE. The course's front nine are located just south of the National Arboretum. Part of the course's back nine holes are located on Kingman Island, which is bordered by the Anacostia River in the east and Kingman Lake in the west.\nLangston Golf Course should not be confused with the Anacostia Golf Course, an 18-hole golf course also located in Anacostia Park. Anacostia Golf Course was on the eastern shore of the Anacostia River. It opened in May 1933 and closed in June 1958.\nCourse description.\nLangston Golf Course is an 18-hole, par 72 course. Other services offered at the course include a driving range with 50 slots, golf school, golf shop, putting green, and snack bar. There are several \"junior golf\" programs for children and teens, and a learning center aimed at low-income children. In 2009, about 25,000 rounds of golf were played on the course each year. Some of the more famous people who have regularly played the course include boxer Joe Louis, baseball player Maury Wills, golfer Ted Rhodes, golfer Calvin Peete, golfer Charlie Sifford, golfer Al Morton, comedian Bob Hope, President Gerald Ford, swing singer Billy Eckstine, tennis legend Althea Gibson, celebrated African American amateur golfer Ethel Funches, and football star Jim Thorpe. According to a report in the \"Washington Post\", every great African American professional golfer in the United States has played at the course since its opening, with the exception of Tiger Woods.\nLangston Golf Course is considered the best publicly owned course in the city. In 2004, a local newspaper described its driving range and practice tees as \"excellent.\" The course is the only golf course in the city with water hazards. Holes 8 and 9 are considered quite challenging. A reporter with ESPN.com, however, evaluated the course's toughest holes differently:\n\"The Washington Post\" has characterized the first hole as \"a treacherous 483-yard par 5 over water...\"\nIn 2009, the course's manager was Jimmy Garvin. He had been the golf course's manager since 2001.\nBuilding the course.\nThe first D.C. golf course which allowed people of color to play was the municipally owned Lincoln Memorial Golf Course, which opened on June 8, 1924. The course, which had only nine holes, extended from west of the Lincoln Memorial north along the Potomac River to about 27th Street NW. In 1925, the all-black Riverside Golf Club was organized to promote play on the new course. Some members split off from this club six months after its formation to organize the Citizens Golf Club, which later changed its name to the Capital City Golf Club in 1927 and the Royal Golf Club in 1933. The Capital City/Royal club began advocating for expanded facilities for the burgeoning number of African American golfers in the city, and requested that the federal government (which operated all five golf courses in the city limits) construct a new 18-hole course for blacks to play at. In 1927, John Langford, a prominent black architect in the city, petitioned the federal government to build the course on the new Anacostia Park, which was being built on both banks of the Anacostia River from material dredged from the riverbottom. Over the next several years, African American golfers in the city and surrounding areas held rallies, attended hearings, wrote letters, and lobbied Congress and executive branch officials to build the new course in Anacostia Park.\nIn 1934, government officials met with representatives of the black golfing community, including members of the Royal Golf Club, and agreed to build the new course in Anacostia Park. Over the next five years, club members, golfers, and government officials worked to identify a site and construct the course. The first nine holes of Langston Golf Course were built on the north end of Kingman Island in 1939. The Civilian Conservation Corps and the Works Project Administration constructed the course. Construction began in 1936 and was nearing completion in February 1938, with an anticipated completion date of mid-1939.\nIn December 1938, park concessionaire Severine G. Leoffler, Sr., won the contract to administer the new Langston course. His firm had first started managing Park Service courses in the city in 1921. Loeffler, who rose from extreme poverty to own a popular local restaurant and then became a noted concessionaire for the National Park Service, administered Langston and the other city golf courses for the next four decades. The course opened at 2:00 pm on June 11, 1939. Frank T. Bartside, Acting Superintendent of the National Capital Parks, opened the course. African American golfer Clyde Martin hit the first ball on the course. (Martin became the first pro at Langston Golf Course.)\nWhen it opened, Langston was one of only 20 golf courses in the United States open to blacks. But the course was not in good shape. Some of the greens lacked grass. An open sewer ran alongside the number three and five fairways.\nThe inadequate facilities at Langston led many black golfers to continue to agitate for expansion of the course. African Americans attempted to play golf at the all-white East Potomac Park Golf Course, Rock Creek Park Golf Course, and other all-white courses, but were usually prevented from doing so. Black golfers continued to lobby, rally, and testify in favor of an additional nine holes at Langston. In 1954, the Supreme Court of the United States held in \"Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka\", 347 U.S. 483, that de jure racial segregation was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Golf courses in Washington, D.C., were desegregated in 1955. That same year, the back nine holes at Langston were built in Anacostia Park (on the western shore of Kingman Lake). Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and in particular after the course's completion in 1955, Langston Golf Course was a regular stop for African Americans playing United Golf Association tournaments (because the PGA Tour was restricted to whites only).\nCourse history.\nFirst four decades.\nTwo plane crashes occurred on Langston Golf Course in the 1940s. On December 28, 1945, a single-engine civilian light plan landed without incident on the course after weather forced the pilot down. Another light plane, this one with engine problems, was forced to land on the course in 1948.\nThe Leoffler company's management of the course came under scrutiny in the late 1940s. Golfers complained about the course so vehemently that U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Public Lands began an investigation and asked the Park Service to delay renewing the firm's contract. A consultant strongly criticized the firm's stewardship of the course. Nonetheless, the Loeffler company renewed its contract to manage Langston Golf Course in 1951. In the summer of 1951, Leoffler won special permission from the Office of Price Stabilization (a federal agency created to control prices during the Korean War) to raise fees at the course. The company signed a 10-year contract to manage the course in 1954.\nIn 1957, the course suffered a setback when its one-story, concrete storage building burned to the ground, destroying $3,000 ($23,275 in 2010 inflated-adjusted dollars) worth of maintenance equipment.\nThe National Capital Planning Commission proposed filling in of Kingman Lake (about 50 to 60 percent of the lake's total area) in 1961 to make two small unnamed islands in the lake part of the mainland, which would add an additional to Langston Golf Course. This plan was never acted on. In 1963, Leoffler reported that Langston Golf Course had been turning a profit under his management, even though the company had spent tens of thousands of dollars to have the greens refurbished and a miniature golf course added. Later that year, the NPS put a fence around Langston Golf Course to prevent golfers from accessing the course without paying fees and to prevent school children (some of whom had been hit by golf balls) from crossing the course during play. The course was closed for 24 hours on November 25, 1963, the day President John F. Kennedy was buried.\nLangston was twice threatened with destruction in the 1960s. In 1964, Washington, D.C., officials proposed closing the first nine holes of Langston Golf Course and building the Barney Circle Freeway on the land, but the National Park Service (which owned and managed the island at the time) refused to turn over the land to the city. In 1969, the city of Washington proposed closing all of Langston Golf Course and building extensive low-income public housing on the golf course and the rest of Kingman Island. The National Park Service rejected that plan as well. Perhaps the biggest threat to the course was a study by the Park Service in the mid-1960s which called for a new federally owned golf course to be built at Oxon Cove Park and Oxon Hill Farm (just over the District line in Maryland). This study showed that D.C. golfers would be better served by the new course, and that Langston should be closed. But by 1977, the Oxon Cove course had yet to be built, and the plan died.\nIt is unclear what the financial status of Langston Golf Course was during its first 40 years. In 1962, the Leoffler company claimed the course had been turning a profit since 1939. In 1972, the \"Washington Post\" reported that the course grossed $100,000, while rent to the National Park Service was just $10,000. In 1975, The Leoffler family said it lost $300,000 to $500,000 in the 35 years it ran the course (about $8,600 to $14,300 a year), and Langston City Golf Corp. (which took over the lease in 1974) said it lost $50,000 on the course in just a year. (At the time, it was estimated about 125 to 200 golfers used the course each day.) In 1981, the \"Washington Post\" claimed that the course had lost money nearly every year since its opening.\nElder years.\nFrom 1978 to 1981, African American golfer Lee Elder managed Langston Golf Course. Elder had taught golf at Langston from 1960 to 1962. He met his future wife, Rose Harper, on the course. In 1970, Elder began seeking the National Park Service concession to manage Langston. He did not get the contract, but sought it again in 1972. Once more, he failed to win the concession. The Loeffler family gave up its concession contract in July 1974. A group of seven local investors formed the Langston City Golf Corp., and assumed the lease. By July 1975, the grounds were in extremely bad shape (\"a virtual ruin\", the press said), needing an estimated $250,000 in repairs. Unable to obtain Congressional funding for maintenance for the course and with Langston City Golf Corp. suffering from severe management problems, the National Park Service shut Langston down in July 1975. In November 1975, Elder once more sought to manage Langston Golf Course. Again, Elder was rebuffed.\nNine holes at Langston re-opened in September 1976, and the remaining nine holes on April 15, 1977. The National Park Service began looking for a new concessionaire to take over the park in September 1977.\nElder won the concession in August 1978. He immediately spent $100,000 refurbishing the course. By the end of 1981, the company said it had made another $160,000 in improvements. But in December 1981, the National Park Service closed the course after Elder's company canceled its insurance policies covering the course. The reason for the cancellation was in dispute. The National Park Service claimed that only 21,500 golfers used the course in 1980 (down from about 30,000 in 1979), and that the Elder firm had not made the improvements required by its contract. Lee and Rose Elder, however, countered that the number of golfers using the course had risen since 1978, and that the park service was refusing to make alterations to the concessions contract that were needed to keep the course profitable. The course closed in the fall of 1981, as Lee Elder Enterprises ran into financial trouble and could not keep it open. In April 1982, Lee Elder Enterprises said it owed $200,000 to creditors and was unable to pay. The D.C. court overseeing the company's financial problems said kitchen, maintenance, and sports equipment would be auctioned off to help pay the debts. With the collapse of the Elder company, the National Park Service withdrew its contract and sought a new concessionaire. But the Park Service was also seriously considering closing the course for good.\nWith Langston Golf Course closed for the third time in 10 years, District of Columbia highway officials argued the land should be used for a new bridge across the Anacostia River. The Barney Circle Freeway would at last be built (they claimed) to bring the Southeast Freeway north along the west bank of the Anacostia River, through Anacostia Park and Langston Golf Course, and then travel over the new bridge to connect with the Anacostia Freeway. But widespread protests from wealthy Capitol Hill residents, numerous lawsuits, and design changes caused the freeway's cost to balloon to $160 million, and it remained unbuilt by 1992. The D.C. City Council had the final say on whether to proceed with the project or not. In December 1994, the City Council bowed to neighborhood opposition and voted overwhelmingly to cancel the Barney Circle Freeway.\nRFK Stadium parking lot issue.\nIn April 1983, the National Park Service chose a new company, Golf Course Specialists, to manage Langston Golf Course. The company reopened the course by Memorial Day weekend. The company considered Langston the worst golf course in the entire D.C. metropolitan area when it took over. The clubhouse had chicken wire over the windows to prevent breakage, iron bars covered all windows and doors, and buildings and the course had been heavily vandalized. The greens were in very bad condition, and poor neighborhood children would sneak onto the course and steal balls in play so that they could sell them back to golfers. Over the next five years, numerous improvements were made to the course. To discourage kids from stealing golf balls, course manager Wallace \"Sarge\" McCombs (a former United States Army sergeant) hired many of the children to find lost balls in the traps and rough. The rough was groomed, greens resodded, security patrols increased to reduce daylight and after-hours crime, and a community outreach program implemented. Trash was cleared from the fairways and greens, water coolers were placed at each tee, portable toilets were put on the course at strategic spots, and clubhouse and course etiquette rigidly enforced. The number of golfers climbed from a low of 20,000 in 1981 to 33,000 in 1986 and a projected 40,000 in 1987. Gross revenues also rose significantly, from $70,000 in 1983 to a projected $150,000 in 1987.\nThese improvements did not stop development threats to the course. In 1986, D.C. officials considered but rejected Langston as a site for a new city jail. A far more serious threat came from football. In 1987, the District of Columbia began looking for a way to upgrade or replace RFK Stadium so that the Washington Redskins would continue to play their games inside the city limits. In the summer of 1986, D.C. Mayor Marion Barry and Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke agreed to dismantle Langston Golf Course and use the site for parking for a new stadium. But after protests from golfers and local residents (who did not want large amounts of traffic flowing through their neighborhood), Barry ruled out using Langston in the summer of 1987. Cooke continued to press for parking at Langston, and in August 1988 met with United States Secretary of the Interior Donald P. Hodel to demand that the National Park Service nonetheless study the feasibility of his request. Hodel agreed to do so. Under pressure, Mayor Barry agreed to consider using Langston Golf Course for parking if the federal government would turn over nearby federal property for a redesigned, new 18-hole course to replace the lost grounds. Barry even hired Lee Elder to begin designing a new course. But William Penn Mott Jr., NPS Director, said that the Park Service was strongly opposed to the use of any Anacostia Park or Langston Golf Course land for parking. D.C. officials asked the agency to reconsider its decision. Four years drifted by, and still stadium talks were ongoing. Marion Barry declined to run for re-election in 1990 after being videotaped smoking crack cocaine in a D.C. hotel. As the District still struggled to craft a deal to build a new stadium, the new Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan, Jr., forced the city's new mayor, Sharon Pratt Dixon, to agree to preserve Langston Golf Course (although Lujan did agree to allow a redesign of the facility to accommodate some stadium parking). In January 1992, Mayor Dixon announced that golfers Arnold Palmer and Gary Player and businesswoman Rose Elder would design a new Langston Golf Course if the existing grounds were used for football stadium parking. By March 1992, Mayor Dixon was still proposing that parking be built on Langston Golf Course.\nAs the stadium talks continued, a controversy over the concessions contract at Langston erupted. Former D.C. Council chairman Arrington Dixon (and husband of Mayor Dixon) protested that the National Park Service—which was on the verge of signing a new, 15-year contract with Golf Course Specialists, Inc.—should suspend any contract negotiations until such time as the stadium issue was resolved, and that only minority-owned firms should be considered to manage the course. The new contract would commit Golf Course Specialists to pay $1.5 million to make a large number of improvements to the course, including a new clubhouse to replace the existing dilapidated structure (which had recently been closed due to health concerns). It also boosted the Park Service's share of net revenues from 2 percent to 20 percent. Secretary Lujan said he would sign the 15-year contract, but that it would include a clause terminating the agreement if a stadium deal was reached by April 3, 1992. When no deal was forthcoming by April 3, Lujan moved ahead with the new contract and the golf course's renovations, which included the major clubhouse renovation.\nThe District's insistence that parking be built on Langston Golf Course, however, helped clinch a stadium agreement: On December 7, 1992, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke agreed to build his team's new stadium next to RFK Stadium. But rising Congressional opposition to the stadium deal (primarily due to the impact it would have on local residents and its high costs) imperiled the stadium deal. Congressional opposition rose significantly after the stadium's chief proponent, D.C. City Council Chairman John A. Wilson, committed suicide on May 19, 1993. By December, Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke abandoned the D.C. site and pledged to build his stadium in Maryland. FedExField opened in Landover, Maryland, in August 1997.\nGolf Course Specialists years.\nWith the stadium threat to Langston Golf Course gone, a number of improvements went ahead. In 1988, the Nation's Capital Bicentennial Celebration committee said it would spearhead a $15 million fund-raising project to build a family golf center at Langston. This project, however, was not forthcoming. In 1999, heavy rains washed away some fairways and greens, exposing buried trash (such as household appliances). An $8 million project to regrade the course to improve drainage began. A year later, the concessionaire agreed to begin a series of projects to bring Langston Golf Course up to Professional Golfers Association standards. In 2002, a print of a painting by noted local artist Linwood Barnes depicting Clyde Martin taking the first drive at Langston Golf Course was hung in the clubhouse. In May 2002, Langston Golf Course became one of the first courses to host a First Tee chapter, a program designed to interest minorities and economically disadvantaged children in golf. In 2002 and 2003, Langston Golf Course opened a putt-and-chip practice area for young golfers and a four-hole course for novices. An academic resource center with computer stations, a small library, and tutoring and study programs was also opened. Students from local junior and senior high schools who study their schoolwork in the education center for an hour are awarded a free hour golf on the course. In 2002, about 200 students took advantage of the educational center. (The number had risen to 400 students by 2006.) The National Park Service and the concessionaire also established a strategic plan to raise $12 million to $17 million in public and private funds to complete the upgrade to PGA tour standards, build a new clubhouse with banquet facilities, establish a museum dedicated to African American golfers, replace the driving range, and expand the education center. In 2007, D.C. Delegate to Congress Eleanor Holmes Norton introduced the \"Golf Course Preservation and Modernization Act\" in Congress, legislation which would allow the National Park Service (NPS) to lease Langston and the other federally owned golf courses in the District of Columbia (rather than simply offer a concession contract). A long-term lease, Norton said, would allow the lessee to obtain high levels of capital investment funds and greatly improve the courses.\nIn 2006, course manager Jimmy Garvin was inducted into the African American Golfers Hall of Fame for his community outreach efforts and work at restoring and maintaining Langston Golf Course. The following year, Golf Course Specialists founder and golfer Bob Brock was inducted into the African American Golfers Hall of Fame for his work in saving Langston.\nOne of Langston's most difficult challenges is dealing with the giant Canada geese (\"Branta canadensis maxima\") which inhabit the tidal marshes of Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River. Hundreds of the birds inhabit the marshes. The birds not only feed voraciously on the course's grasses, but their feces harm the greens and pose a health hazard to golfers. They also feed on and destroy the marsh plants which the National Park Service planted in Kingman Lake and the Anacostia River in the hope that these will help filter the water and restore the health of the river. In 2007, federal park officials began considering a program to cull the geese population around Langston Golf Course in an attempt to save the river, an effort opposed by some animal rights groups.\nLangston Golf Course celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2009. Golfing pioneer Calvin Peete and other noted African American golfers held a celebration in the course's clubhouse on June 11, golf celebrities and city officials held a banquet in the Historical Society of Washington, D.C., City Museum, and the African American Golfers Hall of Fame awards were held in the city.\nDespite the historic nature of the course and the many improvements to it in the past decades, Langston Golf Course has never hosted a PGA event or U.S. Open tournament.\nNational Links Trust years.\nIn 2020, the National Park Service signed an agreement with National Links Trust to operate the course along with the two other courses located in DC."

        "text": "The Latin America Region has competed in the Little League World Series since its creation in 1958. Until 2001, the Latin America Region included Mexico and the Caribbean. In 2001 – when the Little League World Series expanded to sixteen teams – Mexico and the Caribbean were given their own regions. The region is open to all countries on the Latin American mainland, but is typically contested by the teams from Panama and Venezuela. Since the 2001 split, the region has been represented by either Venezuela (11 appearances) or Panama (seven appearances) at the Little League World Series, as of 2019.\nFollowing the 2021 LLWS, Panama and the Caribbean Region countries of Cuba and Puerto Rico will take up two berths in the LLWS. Two of the three will send champions to the LLWS each year, while the third will compete in its normal region; the automatic berths will rotate annually. This scheme is part of a planned expansion of the LLWS from 16 to 20 teams that was originally scheduled to occur for 2021, but was delayed to 2022 due to COVID-19.\nTeams from Latin America have won the LLWS title five times, but only four were as the Latin America Region champion. The Industrial Little League of Monterrey, Mexico, won back-to-back titles in 1957 and 1958, but the first title was as the champion of the South Region. The other three LLWS championships were won by Guadalupe, Nuevo León, Mexico, in 1997, and Maracaibo, Venezuela, in 1994 and 2000.\nSummary.\n\"As of the 2023 Little League World Series\"\n\"Italics\" indicates team no longer competes in Latin America Region.

        "title": "Archery at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics – Girls' individual",
        "text": "The girls' individual archery event at the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics was held from 18 to 20 August 2010 at the Kallang Field in Kallang, Singapore. It was one of three recurve archery events which comprised the archery programme at the inaugural Summer Youth Olympics, and featured thirty-one archers from thirty-one countries. Entry was open to female archers born between 1 January 1992 and 31 December 1993.\nQualification was conducted through a tournament held in parallel at the 2009 Archery World Youth Championships, as well as through five continental tournaments held in 2009 and 2010. The event was among the first to follow the new competition format adopted by the \"Federation Internationale Tir de l'Arc\" (FITA) for international tournaments earlier in 2010.\nKwak Ye-ji of South Korea, who was tipped as the favourite for gold medal, emerged as champion after winning in the final against Tan Ya-ting of Chinese Taipei, who received the silver medal as runner-up. Russia's Tatiana Segina finished in third place, winning the bronze medal ahead of Mexico's Mariana Avitia.\nFormat.\nThe girls' individual recurve event was an outdoor recurve target archery event. Held to FITA-approved rules, the archers shot at a 122 cm-wide target from a distance of 70 metres, with between one and ten points being awarded for each arrow depending on how close it landed to the centre of the target. The competition took place over two days, with an initial ranking round being followed by a single-elimination tournament consisting of five rounds and concluding with two matches to determine the winners of the gold, silver, and bronze medals. The ranking round was held on 18 August and determined the seeds for the elimination rounds, which also began on 18 August and concluded two days later. Each of the thirty-one archers shot a total of 72 arrows. The archer with the highest scoring total from her 72 arrows received the number one seed, the archer with the second highest total receiving second seed, and so on. In the event of a tie between two or more archers, the number of arrows shot in the central 10-ring of the target was taken into account, with the number of arrows shot within the inner-10 (or X) ring used as a second tiebreaker if necessary.\nThe format of the elimination and medal-deciding rounds followed the Archery Olympic Round set system that had been recently introduced in international World Archery events. The elimination rounds began on 18 August with the 1/16 round and concluded two days later on 20 August, with the bronze and gold medal finals following afterwards. Each match consisted of a maximum of five sets, with archers each shooting three arrows per set. The archer with the greater score from their three arrows won the set, earning two set points. The archer with the lower score in each set received zero points. If the score was tied, each archer received one point. The first archer to reach six set points was declared the winner. If the match was tied at five set points each after the maximum five sets were played, a single tie-breaker arrow was used with the closest to centre of the target winning.\nReport.\nPre-event.\nSouth Korea's Kwak Ye-ji was tipped as the favourite for gold medal, the world number seven entering as the most decorated archer at the Youth Olympics having won gold medal in the final of the 2009 Archery World Cup and silver medal at the 2009 World Archery Championships. At age 17, Mariana Avitia of Mexico became her nation's youngest athlete to compete in two Olympic games, the world number fifteen having competed in the women's individual event at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing.\nThe withdrawal of a competitor from Brazil before the start of the event led to only thirty-one archers taking part instead of the expected thirty-two. As the Brazilian archer was also set to compete in the mixed team event, which was contested by athletes paired from the girls' and boys' individual events, FITA and the International Olympic Committee granted an additional entry from Singapore to ensure the mixed team event had an even number of entrants. Elizabeth Cheok was selected as the replacement, although she was not permitted to compete in the individual event. The top seed from the ranking round was therefore given a bye to the second elimination round to compensate for the lack of a thirty-second seed.\nRanking round.\nThe competition began on the morning of 18 August with the 72-arrow ranking round. Kwak was in dominant form, clinching the top seed by a comfortable margin of 22 points over Tan Ya-ting of Chinese Taipei and setting a new junior world record in the process. Her score of 670 – out of a maximum of 720 – beat the existing record set by compatriot Um Hye-rang in 2001 by four points. Choi Seung Sil, the South Korean coach, however reflected that Kwak's achievement was no cause for excitement, commenting that \"[i]n practice she will score up to 680, so we don't really care about breaking the record.\" Behind Tan in second was Russia's Tatiana Segina on 639 points, with Mariana Avitia and India's Seema Verma placing fourth and fifth.\nElimination rounds.\nThe knock-out rounds began on the afternoon of 18 August with the 1/16 elimination rounds. The top eight seeds each advanced to the 1/8 eliminations with ninth-seed Gloria Filippi of Italy the highest ranked archer failing to progress. After a break in play on 19 August, in which the mixed team competition was contested, the girls' individual event resumed for its final day of competition on 20 August, the morning session hosting the 1/8 elimination round. Kwak, Tan, Segina, and Avitia all advanced to the quarter-finals, Tan eliminating the bronze medalist from the mixed team event Turkey's Begünhan Elif Ünsal in the process. The round also saw Moldova's Alexandra Mîrca come back from two sets down to defeat Alice Ingley of Australia — a shot in the third set by the Australian which scored just four points was noted by FITA commentators Vanahé Antille and Didier Mieville as the turning point in the match. The weather intervened with a short rain shower during the fifth match of the morning between Miranda Leek of the United States and Isabel Viehmeier of Germany. The wet conditions appeared to affect Leek's form in particular, the American exiting the competition after failing to score higher than an eight until her eighth arrow of the match, by which time Viehmeier held a four set point lead. The rainfall ceased shortly after the beginning of the following match between China's Song Jia and Ukraine's Lidiia Sichenikova, Song winning by seven set points to three.\nThe quarter-finals kicked off the final day's afternoon session at 2:30pm, Kwak, Tan, Segina, and Avitia again successfully advancing to reach the semi-finals. The first match between Kwak and Mîrca was a tight affair, Kwak winning the first and third sets and Mîrca winning the second and fourth. The South Korean however clinched the fifth set by one point - thereby avoiding a one-arrow shoot-off - after a judge confirmed in a post-match review that Mîrca's first arrow of the set landed within the 8-ring rather than edging into the 9-ring. In the other quarter-final contests Tan and Segina dispatched Viehmeier and Song respectively in straight sets while Avitia dropped just one set in her victory against Belgium's Zoé Göbbels.\nThe two semi-final matches were held immediately after the quarter-finals. Kwak and Tan each overcame poor starts to progress to the gold medal final. Kwak lost the first two sets to Avitia, but with the Mexican failing to land an arrow in the central 10 ring for the rest of the match, Kwak prevailed in the next three sets to win by six set points to four. In the second semi-final Tan began with a six on her first arrow, gifting Segina a straightforward victory in the opening set. A perfect score of thirty in the second set however brought Tan back into contention. A narrowly won third set and a score of twenty-nine in the fourth was enough for Tan to win the match secure a spot in the final.\nMedal matches.\nAs the two losing archers from the semi-finals, Avitia and Segina met to contest the bronze medal final, which followed the semi-final matches at just before 4pm. After three sets Segina held the advantage, and when Avitia faltered with her final arrow in the fourth set, scoring just a seven, Segina shot into the 10 ring resulting in victory and the bronze medal for the Russian. Following the match Avitia said she was satisfied and not disappointed with a fourth-place finish, feeling she had put in a strong performance against Kwak in the semi-finals. She however stated that the quick turnaround between competing at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games and the Youth Olympics may have influenced her overall form, having not had sufficient time for rest before arriving in Singapore.\nThe gold medal final saw Kwak defeat Tan in four sets, posting a total score of 117 in her 12 arrows that would have been a new junior world record under the previous FITA competition format. Kwak's perfect scores of 30 in the first and third sets was met by Tan's own maximum score in the second, but Kwak's total of 29 in the fourth set was too much for Tan, the South Korean taking what the Yonhap News Agency described as a \"widely expected\" victory. Afterwards Kwak admitted she had felt nervous in the final after her tough semi-final victory over Avitia, but immediately set her sights on replicating her success at the 2012 Summer Olympics, stating her aim was to win two gold medals in London. As runner-up, Tan received the silver medal. The archer from Chinese Taipei said she had enjoyed the experience of the competition but had mixed emotions about the result, commenting that despite being pleased with her silver medal \"I feel sorry for my family and friends that I didn't bring the gold medal home\"."

        "title": "East Potomac Park Golf Course",
        "text": "East Potomac Golf Links (also locally known as East Potomac Golf Course or formally as East Potomac Park Golf Center) is a golf course located in East Potomac Park in Washington, D.C., United States. The course includes an 18-hole course, two 9-hole courses, and a miniature golf course. It is the busiest of the city's three golf courses (all of which are publicly owned). The original nine-hole course opened in 1921, and the miniature golf course in 1930 (making it one of the oldest miniature golf courses in the nation). Additional holes opened in stages between 1921 and 1925, leaving the course with 36 holes in all.\nServices at East Potomac Golf Links include a pro shop, snack bar, putting greens, three practice holes, and a two-tiered, 100-stall driving range (26 of which are heated). The course is generally flat and easy, although drainage can be poor. The views of the city's many monuments and memorials from the course at East Potomac are considered some of the best in the city.\nConstruction of the courses.\nA municipal golf course in East Potomac Park was first proposed in February 1911, just as East Potomac Park itself was nearing completion. The Washington Chamber of Commerce made a formal request of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in March 1913 to build a course, and the Corps gave its approval a month later. But these plans were put on hold due to World War I. Temporary barracks for soldiers were built on the land, and the remaining space used for victory gardens. But with the end of the war in sight, the Corps revived plans to build a golf course. By March 1919, construction on a nine-hole course was well under way. The course opened on March 15, 1921. President Warren G. Harding was one of the first golfers to play the course.\nBetween 1921 and 1922, a five-hole course was opened, and in the fall of 1922 four more holes were opened to bring the total to 18 holes. Another nine holes opened on May 30, 1925.\nLike all but one golf course in Washington, D.C., from 1900 to 1955, East Potomac Park Golf Course was racially segregated, and barred African Americans from using the course. In 1941, several black golfers attempted to play at East Potomac Park Golf Course, but were attacked by whites throwing stones and threatening them with more violence. African American golfers petitioned United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes for permission to play at the course, which Ickes granted. In July, three black golfers (accompanied by six United States Marshals) played the course, but were jeered and threatened with assault. But with Ickes unable to provide such high levels of protection all the time, African American golfers rarely attempted to play there until the city's golf courses were desegregated in 1955.\nHigh schools around the D.C. area (such as Gonzaga College High School) practice at and sometimes host matches at East Potomac Golf Course.\nIn 2020, the National Park Service signed an agreement with National Links Trust to operate the course along with the two other courses located in DC. They will also work to redesign and rebuild both the White and Red courses, redesign the driving range, construct an 18-hole putting course and restore the clubhouse.\nPotomac Grille.\nPotomac Grille is a no-frills cafeteria at East Potomac Golf Course. It caters to members of the public as well as patrons of the golf course. In May 2017, \"The Washington Post\"'s Going Out Guide wrote that the bacon cheeseburger at Potomac Grille was one of the city's best hamburgers under $10."

        "text": "The Acropolis International Tournament 2010 was a basketball tournament held in OAKA Indoor Hall in Athens, Greece, from August 17 until August 19, 2010. This was the 24th edition of the Acropolis International Basketball Tournament. The four participating teams were Greece, Serbia, Canada, and Slovenia.\nStandings.\nTiebreaker.\nSlovenia, Serbia and Canada all had 1 win and 2 losses. Since each team had won one of the two games with the other teams (excluding Greece, who had a 3–0 record), a second tiebreaker was used to determine the second, third, and fourth place. Compared among the other tied teams, Slovenia had an overall 14 point difference, Serbia had a -3 point difference and Canada had a -11 point difference. The teams were ranked by the point difference from highest to lowest. Thus, Slovenia won the silver medal, Serbia won the bronze, and Canada was left with fourth place.\nGames.\nGreece vs. Canada.\nThe Greeks completely thrashed Canada in game one of the Acropolis tournament, winning 123–49. The team set a new record for the highest point difference in an Acropolis tournament, 74 points. Canada's head coach blamed the long trip from Canada to Greece, and a lack of energy as a result. The Greeks' Schortsanitis put down 24 points, before sustaining an injury late in the third quarter, while Calathes had 10 assists.\nGreece vs. Serbia.\nSerbian head coach Dušan Ivković was ejected with 6:00 remaining in the fourth quarter after receiving his second technical foul of the game.\nBench clearing brawl.\nWith 2:40 left in the game and Greece up by one point, the home team had possession. Receiving a back pass from driving Dimitris Diamantidis who drew a double team, wide-open Greek power forward Antonis Fotsis attempted a three-point shot, while Serbian point guard Miloš Teodosić ran over to cover him and got called for a foul in the process.\nWithin seconds, as Teodosić began complaining to the referee over the call, an agitated Fotsis came over and interrupted Teodosić's attempt at talking to the ref by getting in Teodosić's face with a raised hand and a pointed finger, seemingly lecturing and/or threatening him over what had just occurred. Due to a considerable size advantage, the 2.09 m and 113 kg Fotsis easily imposed himself onto the 1.96 m and 95 kg Teodosić, pushing him back as Diamantidis and Novica Veličković, as well as one of the referees, quickly joined in an attempt to separate the two. With three people now holding Fotsis and Teodosić apart, Fotsis managed to grab a hold of both of Teodosić's arms to which Teodosić reacted by trying to free himself, moving his hand towards Fotsis' face. Already well agitated, Fotsis reacted by spitting in Teodosić's face as Marko Kešelj now also joined the group holding the two. Fotsis followed by grabbing the back of Teodosić's head with the left hand and attempting to punch him with the right, but couldn't throw the punch because of being held back by the people around him. Fotsis' spitting and attempted punching of Teodosić drew more players into the fight as Serbian captain Nenad Krstić jumped in from the back, grabbing Fotsis' face with an open hand while Veličković proceeded to do the same, managing to wrestle Fotsis away from Teodosić.\nMayhem then engulfed the entire court as both squads - including the benches and team officials - became involved. The pack moved to the bench where Krstić threw a chair that hit Ioannis Bourousis in the head; Bourousis was not scheduled to appear on the court due to injury and was watching the game on the bench.\nAfter the brawl, for safety reasons, the game was abandoned with the final score standing at 74-73 for Greece, while Krstić was arrested and held overnight for assaulting Bourousis.\nFor their involvement in the brawl, Krstic was suspended for the first three games in the 2010 FIBA World Championship tournament and fined CHF 45,000 (€42,800/USD $46,000), while Teodosic, Fotsis and Sofoklis Schortsanitis were suspended for the first two games. Both teams were also fined CHF 20,000 (€19,000/USD$20,500) by FIBA."

        "text": "William Douglas \"D. J.\" Mitchell Jr. (born May 13, 1987) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the New York Yankees in 2012. Before embarking on his professional career, he played college baseball at Clemson University.\nAmateur career.\nMitchell graduated from North Forsyth High School in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and attended Clemson University, where he played college baseball for the Clemson Tigers baseball team in the Atlantic Coast Conference. In 2006, Mitchell's freshman year, he played as a right fielder. Mitchell began to pitch in 2007, his sophomore year at Clemson. After Clemson's 2007 season concluded, Mitchell pitched for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL), a collegiate summer baseball league. He led the CCBL in strikeouts, earning him recognition in \"Sports Illustrated\"s \"Faces in the Crowd\" feature. By 2008, Mitchell played exclusively as a pitcher, and he was named First Team All-ACC.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Yankees.\nThe New York Yankees drafted Mitchell in the 10th round, 320th overall, of the 2008 Major League Baseball Draft. Making his professional debut in 2009, he had a 1.95 earned run average (ERA) in 6 games with the Charleston RiverDogs of the Class A South Atlantic League. He had a 2.87 ERA in 19 games after his promotion to the Tampa Yankees of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. After the season, Baseball Prospectus ranked Mitchell as the organization's 11th best prospect.\nMitchell began the 2010 season with the Trenton Thunder of the Class AA Eastern League. On August 21, 2010, Mitchell was promoted from Trenton to the Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees of the International League. Before the 2011 season, Mitchell was rated the organization's 18th best prospect and 10th best pitching prospect. In 2011, he had a 13–9 win–loss record with a 3.18 ERA for Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. For this performance, Mitchell won the 2011 Yankees' Minor League \"Pitcher of the Year\" Award.\nMitchell was added to the Yankees 40-man roster after the 2011 season to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. Competing for the long reliever role with the Yankees in spring training in 2012, the Yankees chose David Phelps for the role, and Mitchell was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\nOn April 29, 2012, Mitchell was recalled to the Yankees after Freddy García was moved to the bullpen. David Phelps was placed in the rotation, Cody Eppley was optioned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, and Mitchell took Phelps' role of long relief. He made his major league debut on May 1, 2012, against the Baltimore Orioles, allowing two hits and striking out one in an inning of work. He made three more appearances with the Yankees.\nSeattle Mariners.\nThe Yankees traded Mitchell and pitcher Danny Farquhar to the Seattle Mariners for Ichiro Suzuki on July 23, 2012. Mitchell was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma after the trade and pitched to a 2.96 ERA in eight starts. On April 11, 2013, Mitchell was designated for assignment. After clearing waivers, he opted for free agency.\nNew York Mets.\nMitchell signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets on April 22, 2013. He pitched to a 7.71 ERA in 81.2 innings out of the bullpen and starting rotation. Mitchell became a free agent after the season.\nBridgeport Bluefish.\nMitchell signed with Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for 2014 season.

        "text": "The Holy Cross Crusaders men's ice hockey team is a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I college ice hockey program that represents the College of the Holy Cross. The Crusaders are a member of the Atlantic Hockey Association (AHA). They play at the Hart Center in Worcester, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nHoly Cross men's ice hockey began in 1966 and a year later it joined ECAC 2. The Crusaders played in the second tier of college ice hockey for ten years before they played their first playoff game, but once they made it they didn't go very far. Over a six year period Holy Cross wen 2–5 in the conference postseason and never really got close to an NCAA tournament berth. When Division II ice hockey was abandoned in 1984 Holy Cross dropped down to Division III and was placed in ECAC East when ECAC 2 split. They made the ECAC tournament three out of four years under Peter Van Buskirk but couldn't manage a win. The team went through a down period under Bill Bellerose for six seasons but started winning again when Paul Pearl became head coach in 1994. After recording their best season in fifteen years Holy Cross promoted its program to Division I and joined the MAAC in 1998–99.\nIn their first year of D–I play Holy Cross won its first Conference Tournament, winning the inaugural MAAC Championship. Unfortunately, because the NCAA did not offer the MAAC an automatic bid at that time the Crusaders did not make the NCAA tournament. The next season Holy Cross dropped to seventh in the conference and lost 24 games over the course of the season (a program worst). After missing out on the conference tournament the next season Holy Cross returned to the playoffs for the final two years of the MAAC's existence before joining with all former MAAC programs in founding Atlantic Hockey.\nSimilar to their start with the MAAC, Holy Cross produced a great season, winning 22 games, and were able to win their first conference title. They then swept through the Atlantic Hockey playoffs and captured their second tournament championship, though this time they received a berth into the NCAA tournament for the first time. Though their national championship experience was brief the Crusaders continued to play well and returned to the Championship in 2006 after winning both conference crowns. The met #2 overall seeded Minnesota in the first round and pushed the heavily favored Golden Gophers into overtime where Tyler McGregor scored 53 seconds in, winning what is usually noted as the biggest upset in tournament history.\nHoly Cross would decline after their miraculous 2006 season, posting losing records for four consecutive years, but the program began to recover in the second decade of the 20th century. Paul Pearl resigned in 2014 and was replaced by David Berard who saw middling regular season results.\nIn the 2022-2023 regular season Holy Cross won their first Atlantic Hockey playoff round since the 2006 season against American International College. They would later upset Rochester Institute of Technology in the semifinals of the tournament but lose in the championship to Canisius.\nSeason-by-season results\nSource:\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Crusaders have appeared in the NCAA tournament two times.

        "text": "Victor Michael Cruz (born November 11, 1986) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at UMass, and signed with the New York Giants as an undrafted free agent in 2010. With the Giants, he won Super Bowl XLVI over the New England Patriots, and made the 2012 Pro Bowl.\nEarly years.\nCruz was born in Paterson, New Jersey, on November 11, 1986, to Blanca Cruz and Michael Walker, a firefighter. His father was African American and his mother is Puerto Rican. Cruz's father died by suicide in 2007.\nCruz attended Paterson Catholic High School in Paterson. He completed a post-graduate semester at Bridgton Academy in North Bridgton, Maine. Cruz put up 47 catches for 869 yards and eight touchdowns in his single season at Bridgton Academy. At Paterson Catholic, Victor played wide receiver and defensive back for coach Andrew Slome, who he credits for his success. He earned All-State honors as a senior in 2003, when the team went undefeated at 11–0 and captured the New Jersey Parochial Group I championship. That season, Cruz caught 42 passes and scored 19 touchdowns—15 on receptions.\nCollege career.\nCruz initially struggled to successfully combine his college studies with his football career, and was twice sent home from the University of Massachusetts for academic reasons. He only became eligible to play for the University of Massachusetts (UMass) in 2007, but went on to have both a solid college football career and to complete a BA in Afro-American Studies from UMass.\nCruz finished his career at UMass with 131 catches ranking him fourth on the all-time UMass receptions list, despite the fact that he didn't start a game until his junior season. He scored 11 touchdowns in his career and had just under 2,000 receiving yards. Cruz was named a first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association wide receiver for the years 2008 and 2009.\nProfessional career.\nNew York Giants.\nCruz went undrafted in the 2010 NFL draft and was signed the day after the draft by the New York Giants.\n2010 season.\nIn a preseason game against the New York Jets on August 16, 2010, Cruz helped the Giants win 31–16 by catching six passes for 145 yards and three touchdowns. He finished the preseason leading the NFL with 297 receiving yards, tied for the preseason lead with four touchdown catches, and was selected to the Giants' 53-man regular season roster. He was praised and highlighted by critics for his performance throughout the preseason. He played in three games at the start of the season, before a hamstring injury placed him on injured reserve for the remainder of the year.\n2011 season.\nAfter the Giants lost Steve Smith to free agency, Cruz began the season as the team's fourth wide receiver, before injury to Domenik Hixon led to him receiving a larger role in the Giants win over the Philadelphia Eagles in Week 3. Against a heavily favored Eagles team Cruz made a huge impact. Most highlighted was a Cruz reception made between two defenders in which he took to the end zone for a touchdown. Cruz finished that game with three catches for 110 yards and two touchdowns, the first and second of his career.\nIn Week 4, with the Giants trailing 27–24 to the Arizona Cardinals in the fourth quarter with under three minutes left to play, Cruz made a reception and went down without being touched at the Cardinals 29-yard line and released the ball as he got up. Believing that Cruz had fumbled since he was never touched, a Cardinal picked up the ball as if it was still alive. The play was whistled dead, but further replay after the game showed Cruz did appear to fumble. On the next play, Eli Manning threw the game-winning touchdown pass to Hakeem Nicks.\nIn a Week 5 36–25 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Cruz caught a one-handed 68-yard touchdown reception off a tipped pass. Later in the game, Cruz also lost a fumble, allowing Seattle to tie the game at 22. With the Giants down 29–25 inside the 20, Cruz slipped on his route with the ball in the air and in an attempt to catch the ball, tipped it into the arms of Brandon Browner, who returned it 94 yards for the game clinching touchdown.

His 89 yards after the catch on the play is the most by a receiver on a 99-yard reception. This catch has constantly been highlighted as the turning point of the Giants 2011 season. In the same game, Cruz also surpassed Amani Toomer as the record holder for the most single-season receiving yards by a Giant.\nIn Week 17, in a do-or-die game against the Dallas Cowboys for the final playoff slot in the NFC, Cruz had six receptions for 178 yards, including the game's first score with a 74-yard touchdown catch, as well as a fourth quarter, 44-yard catch on third and seven that put the Giants in position to make a field goal that put the Giants up by two scores. The Giants added another touchdown, a 4-yard pass from Manning to Hakeem Nicks, setting a record of 15 fourth quarter touchdown passes in one season for Manning and beat the Cowboys 31–14.

It was released on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, Wii and PlayStation Vita (the latter as Virtua Tennis 4: World Tour Edition). This is the first main series \"Virtua Tennis\" game to not have an arcade release before the console releases. An arcade version was also released, which is powered by the PC-based Sega RingEdge arcade system. There are two versions of the cabinet: an upright 4-player cabinet, and a deluxe 4-player cabinet.\nGameplay.\nThe game supports the PlayStation Move controller on the PlayStation 3, the Kinect on the Xbox 360, and the Wii MotionPlus on the Wii. All previously mentioned devices are optional, although the Wii MotionPlus is required for actual motion-controlled gameplay in the Wii version, which is controlled with the Wii Remote held sideways if the accessory is unavailable. \"Virtua Tennis 4\" allows the player to step into the shoes of some of the world's best tennis pros. The game supports stereoscopic 3D on the PlayStation 3. In the motion control mode of all three console versions, the player's character will automatically move sideways in reaction to where the ball approaches, but the player controls how close they want to be to the net by either holding down a particular button (Wii) or adjusting one's physical distance from the television screen (PS3 and Xbox 360). There is a dynamic camera system in place, so when the ball is in the other half of the court, the camera pans out so that one can see one's position.\nWhen the ball is coming towards the player, it glides into a first person viewpoint where the player can see their racquet in front of him and time their swing accordingly. The player can twist the racquet to adjust its face when it connects with the ball, allowing skilled players to apply spin.\nPlayers.\nA trailer was released on the YouTube channel of Sega America on January 20, 2011 with a partial list of players that were confirmed for the game. On their blog entry published the same day, the seven new inclusions were revealed for the game.\nSix days later, on the Facebook page of the game, the full list of players was released. On 31 March, 3 legends were included to the game, but those are exclusive for PlayStation 3 (along with 2 new mini-games).\nAs well as these players included in the game, the user has the option to create up to eight of their own players in the World Tour mode.\nPlayable Characters.\nMale\nFemale\nDevelopment.\nThis is the first game to be developed by the original Virtua Tennis team since 2006.\nDespite the fact that Sega opted to skip Gamescom, \"Virtua Tennis 4\" was revealed at the convention at Sony's booth.\nWorld Tour Edition.\nAn updated Vita port, entitled \"Virtua Tennis 4: World Tour Edition\", was released in Japan on December 17, 2011, and was to simultaneously launch with the PlayStation Vita, along with being exclusive to Sony's new handheld.\nThe World Tour addition included many exclusive features. More mini-games were added, along with touch controllers. The players can also play in first person mode, and control the game using the Vita's gyroscope. Players may use the handheld's front camera to take a photo of their face, and have the game construct a character based on the photo (similar to the mechanics of the game \"Reality Fighters\"). After the game downloads the image, the users edit the player in a light character customization screen. Different game templates were also added, allowing the user to play in various time periods, ranging from the early 20th century to one-hundred years in the future.\nTwo players may now play using the same system, by turning it sideways in the style of Pong, with each participant using a combination of touch control and buttons or analog to play. Augmented reality can be used to bring tennis players featured in the game to life on your system. The users select a player, and have them brought into onto screen, with the background being whatever is facing the second camera on the system.\nOnline play had also been touched up on, allowing players to share stats, and allowing users to share comments on the other's game home screen.\nThe game itself was enjoyed by players, critics, and actual tennis players alike (See Reception for more on the reviews). Tennis star Andy Murray stated that he enjoyed the game while playing against a representative from Sega, stating that he found it and entertaining, praised the graphics, and said his in game character was an accurate representation of him.\nAs of July 2017, \"Virtua Tennis 4\" is the only tennis simulation game available for the PlayStation Vita.\nReception.\nThe game received \"mixed or average reviews\" on all platforms except the \"World Tour Edition\", which received \"generally favorable reviews\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. In Japan, \"Famitsu\" gave it a score of three nines and one eight for the PlayStation Vita version, and 31 out of 40 for the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, while \"Famitsu X360\" gave the latter console version a score of 32 out of 40.\n\"GameZone\" said of the Xbox 360 version, \"By and large, \"Virtua Tennis 4\" does adhere strongly to its roots, bringing enough excitement to lure a wider audience. However, it would be useful for a study to be conducted of similar titles, so that these updated features could find their way into the beloved franchise.\" \"GameSpot\" said of the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions, \"In almost every respect, \"Virtua Tennis 4\" is outclassed by its rival \"Top Spin 4\"\" because \"Virtua Tennis 4\" has annoying music, too simple controls and unrealistic sound effects."

        "text": "Virtua Tennis (Power Smash in Japan) is a series of tennis simulation video games started in 1999 by Sega AM3. The player competes through tennis tournaments and various arcade modes. While originally released for arcades, all games in the series have been ported to other platforms, including most major consoles.\nName changes.\nIn Japan, the series has always been released as \"Power Smash\", although with the third entry, the name was expanded to \"Sega Professional Tennis: Power Smash\". Even though the Sega Professional Tennis logo and name are prominently featured in all games, it only appears in the titles of the third and fourth games.\nInternationally, the first game was released as \"Virtua Tennis\", to fall in the same brand as other Sega Sports games such as \"Virtua Striker\". With the sequel, the name was changed to \"Tennis 2K2\". However, once Sega sold the 2K name to Take-Two Interactive, the next game was released under the original branding as \"Virtua Tennis 3\". All following updates and sequels have been released under the \"Virtua\" label.\nHistory.\nArcade and Dreamcast.\nThe original game was developed for the Sega Naomi Arcade Hardware by Sega (in 2000 under the label Hitmaker) and ported to the Sega Dreamcast, Sega's home console based on the Naomi Hardware. The sequel, \"Virtua Tennis 2\", brought several improvements, most notably enhanced graphics, more courts, and a female roster (consisting of nine players), featuring such players as Serena Williams, Lindsay Davenport or Jelena Dokić.\nAfter ceasing development of video game consoles in 2001, Sega announced that they would be making games for all platforms, and made a deal with THQ that allowed them to make original games based on Sega franchises for the Game Boy Advance, one of which was an adaptation of the original \"Virtua Tennis\" game.\n\"Virtua Tennis 2\" was ported to the PlayStation 2 in 2002. Sumo Digital was tasked with porting the game to the PlayStation Portable, which gave birth to \"\" in 2005, an updated version of \"Virtua Tennis 2\" that expanded the World Tour mode, but featured the smallest character roster in the series.\nMultiplatform games.\nIn 2006, a new entry, \"Virtua Tennis 3\", was released for arcades using the Sega Lindbergh hardware. The game was ported to the PlayStation 3, with SIXAXIS controls incorporated into the gameplay, as well as to the Xbox 360, the latter port also being handled by Sumo Digital. While working on it, Sumo Digital was instructed by Sega to feature Sonic as an unlockable character, giving them the idea to make a tennis game consisting of Sega characters from various franchises. This was released in 2008 as \"Sega Superstars Tennis\", which ran on the \"Virtua Tennis 3\" engine that Sumo Digital developed for the Xbox 360 port of the game.\nIn 2009, Sumo Digital released an update to \"Virtua Tennis 3\" on the PlayStation Portable called Virtua Tennis 2009.\nAt Gamescom 2010, \"Virtua Tennis 4\" was revealed for the PlayStation 3, with PlayStation Move controls incorporated. The game also introduced a new first-person perspective to help players control the game more effectively with the Move controller.\nSega released \"Virtua Tennis Challenge\" in 2012, the first installment in the series to be released on Android and iOS."

However, Cheshire would not return to the ground until 1933, when they played Denbighshire in the Minor Counties Championship, which would be the last time they would play there for 43 years. In 1939, Helen Bickham bought the ground from the 10th Earl of Stamford in memory of her brother, Ernest Bickham, and proceeded to donate it to the cricket club.\nMinor counties cricket returned to the ground in 1976, when Cheshire played the Somerset Second XI in the Minor Counties Championship. From 1980 to 2001, Cheshire played annually at the ground, with the final Minor Counties Championship match hosted there seeing Shropshire. The ground held its first List A match when it was selected as a home venue for the combined Minor Counties cricket team, with the team playing Lancashire there in the 1984 Benson &amp; Hedges Cup. Cheshire later played two List A matches there, in the 1994 NatWest Trophy against Durham and in the 1999 NatWest Trophy against Kent, with both their first-class opponents winning."

It was held on 15 August 2010 at East Coast Park. The park is Singapore's most popular public beach and park; it is the venue of the Osim Singapore Triathlon, an Olympic triathlon event which began in 2002. Competitors swam in the open seas of the Singapore Strait and raced on the park's track. U.S. triathlon coach Keith Dickson said the course favored strong swimmers and fast runners. Athletes were faced with environmental challenges such as strong sea currents and tropical heat and humidity. As the first medal event of the Singapore Games, the winner of this triathlon received the first gold medal in the Youth Olympic Games.\nYuka Sato of Japan finished the race in first place. She had placed third after the first leg of the race and fifth after the second leg. In the final stretch, Sato sped past Mexico's Adriana Barraza and Australia's Ellie Salthouse. As she crossed the finish line, Sato carried a Japanese flag that had been handed to her by a spectator. She was the only competitor who finished in the top 10 of the ITU Junior Triathlon World Championships in 2009. Salthouse and American Kelly Whitley finished in second and third place, respectively. Canada's Christine Ridenour, who was one of the favourites to win a medal, was involved in a bicycle crash and finished 14th. Singapore's Clara Wong finished in 30th place, and two competitors did not finish after a bicycle crash.\nMost of the competition's 32 participants had qualified through the International Triathlon Union's continental Olympic qualifying events.\nResults.\nThe race began at approximately 9:00 a.m. () on 15 August at East Coast Park.\n\"Note\": No one is allotted the number 13."

It was the third largest competition for European nations behind the WDF World Cup and WDF Europe Cup. The competition was referred to as the 'small' Europe Cup since there were only singles and team events held for men and women.\nOnly the nations from continental Europe were allowed to enter. Established darting nations such as England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland were excluded so 'smaller' less established nations had a chance at success. There was no competition held in 1989 or 2002, but the 2009 edition was cancelled. The 2012 edition was the last. After some speculation, it was announced the competition would not return in 2013 as there were not enough countries willing to enter the competition.\nThe men's and women's singles events, held on the last day, are also individual tournaments which offer both winners entry in to the qualifying rounds for the World Masters.\nCompeting nations.\nThe following is a list of nations that had previously entered the Spring Cup;"

        "text": "Munir Ahmed Dar (28 March 1935 – 1 June 2011) was a Pakistani field hockey player who played as a fullback. He was a member of the Pakistan team that won gold at the 1960 Rome Olympics and silver the 1956 Melbourne and 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games. He captained the side from 1965 to 1967.\nEarly life.\nDar was born on 28 March 1935 in Amritsar, then a part of British India. His family moved to Pakistan after the partition of India in 1947, where he discovered his love for hockey and was a member of his school team. He was also a member of the hockey team of the Government College, Lahore, while he was a student there.\nCareer.\nDar made his debut for the Pakistan national team in 1954. He was picked in the team for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, where Pakistan won the silver in the event, the country's first ever medal in the Olympic Games. During the 1958 Asian Games, Dar broke the world-record for most goals scored by a fullback in a match, when he scored five against South Korea (then Korea), all coming off penalty corners. Pakistan went on to win the game 8–0. Pakistan went on to win gold at the Games; Dar scored a total of eight goals in the competition. Two years later, Dar figured in Pakistan's gold-winning campaign at the 1960 Rome Olympics, that ended India's 32-year hegemony at the Games. He finished with four goals in the 1962 Asian Games, where his team defeated India to claim the gold medal in the final. Dar's third Olympic medal came at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, when the team won silver.\nDar remained Pakistan's first choice as a fullback until his retirement in 1967. Dar also captained his side from 1965 to 1967, leading the team to a silver at the 1966 Asian Games. In 1977, Dar recalled the 1956 Melbourne Olympics silver medal win as the \"most memorable moment\" of his playing career. He scored a total of 41 goals from 92 appearances for Pakistan.\nLater life.\nBefore retirement, Dar groomed his brother Tanvir who also played as a fullback for the Pakistan team between 1965 and 1974. He was a member of the gold-winning team at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics and the 1971 World Cup, the latter of which he was the top-scorer of. Munir had three sons: the eldest, Tauqeer, won gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics; Taseer was stand-by for the team in that Games squad but never got to play for the Pakistan team; and the youngest, Tafseer, was a first-class cricketer. Dar went on to coach the Pakistan's senior and junior national sides in the 1970s and 1980s. The Dar brothers established a hockey academy in Pakistan after their playing days.\nOutside hockey, Dar had an eye for horses and owned several Thoroughbreds, which won many races at the Lahore Race Club. He was the founding president of the Pakistan Karate Federation and also served in the executive committee of the Pakistan Rugby Union. A police officer by profession, Dar served as chairman of the Police Sports Board from 1985 to 1995. During his tenure, the policemen won laurels at the national, Asian and world levels. Dar was also instrumental in raising the Asian-style kabaddi team of the police; some went on to become part of the Pakistan national kabaddi team. Dar suffered from lung cancer and died on 1 June 2011. He was buried in the Defence Graveyard, Lahore."

The qualification draw was held on 20 October 2010, in AFC House in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.\nSeeding.\nThe seedings are based on the 2010 AFC Challenge Cup. Unlike previous editions with the exception of the inaugural edition, no team has been given direct entry into the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup. Defending champions Korea DPR, runners-up Turkmenistan and third-placed Tajikistan would now have to go through the qualifiers to enter the finals. The eight lowest ranked teams would take part in the playoff round while the remaining 12 teams would enter the Group Stage.\nQualifying play-off round.\nFor the pre-qualifying phase, the eight lowest ranked teams played off over two legs on a home-and-away basis with the away goals rule, extra time and penalty shootouts to determine winners if necessary. The matches took place on 9 and 16 February 2011 with the four winners advancing to the group stage. However, for Afghanistan–Bhutan fixtures, they were rescheduled for 23 and 25 March and were played in at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium in Gurgaon, India.\nThe second leg of the Philippines–Mongolia fixture was originally due to take place on 16 February 2011. However, in early January 2011, Philippine Football Federation president Mariano Araneta said he wanted the match to take place at the same venue as the first leg on 12 February, citing the winter conditions in Mongolia. Mongolian Football Federation president Ganbold Buyannemekh insisted that the second leg be played in Mongolia but proposed a 15 March date instead as a compromise.\nSecond leg.\n\"Afghanistan win 5–0 on aggregate\"\n\"Philippines win 3–2 on aggregate\"\n\"Chinese Taipei win 6–3 on aggregate\"\n\"Cambodia win 5–4 on aggregate\"\nQualifying group stage.\nIn the group stage, the 16 teams were divided into four groups of four teams each playing a single round-robin tournament (league system). This included the 12 highest ranked automatically qualified teams and the four qualifiers from the playoff round. The original match days were 20–31 March 2011. The top two teams in each group qualified for the final tournament. On 18 February 2011, the AFC announced that the hosts for each group were: Myanmar for Group A, Malaysia for Group B, Maldives for Group C, and Nepal for Group D; with match dates on 21, 23 and 25 March 2011.\nHowever, for Group D, the All Nepal Football Association proposed the hosting rights since the end of December 2010, which the AFC had endorsed. The fixtures were also scheduled to take place from 21 to 25 March but on 7 February 2011 it was announced that the qualifiers had to be postponed due to the unavailability of the main stadium (Dasarath Rangasala Stadium) due to a wrestling event. The fixtures were then set to 7 to 11 April 2011.\nThe teams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a tie, 0 points for a loss) and tie breakers are in following order:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nQualifiers.\nThe following eight teams qualified for the 2012 AFC Challenge Cup held from 8 to 19 March 2012 in Nepal:"

Kostelić secured his overall victory several races before the end of the season while Riesch and Lindsey Vonn of the United States were close together before the finals at Lenzerheide, Switzerland. Riesch had a significant lead after the World Championship but Vonn caught up and took the lead before the last slalom race. Slovenia's Tina Maze won her first slalom in that race, Riesch's fourth place compared to Vonn's thirteenth gave her a three-point advantage. The cancellation of the last race – one of four to be cancelled at Lenzerheide – meant that Riesch won the title."

Before that, he had success as a high school football coach at St. Ignatius High School from 1929 to 1935.\nBiography.\nMalley, whose grandfather was an Irish immigrant, was born in Arizona and attended Santa Clara University, where he played college football. He served as the team captain in the early 1920s. Malley earned a Bachelor of Philosophy and a Bachelor of Laws.\nHe then coached football at St. Ignatius High School beginning in 1929. He also served on the faculty at the school and taught civics and sociology. St. Ignatius went undefeated from September 1937 until December 1939, when they were finally beaten by Loyola High School of Los Angeles, 12–7, in the California state Catholic prep school championship. The success of Malley's teams prompted the school to promote the program back to the AAA level. In 1934, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" compared his 1935 team to Notre Dame under Knute Rockne:\"Today in San Francisco is an unsung, unnoted football team that embodies about everything that Notre Dame teams of years ago stood for—rambling, fight and Irish—and undefeated records. That team belongs to St. Ignatius High School. The Ignatians ramble over California a bit, next year they may even trek to Reno; Irish names dominate the lineup and the record is clean—not even one point is tabbed for opponents.\"\nMalley moved on to the University of San Francisco in 1936 to serve as an assistant football coach under Spud Lewis. He succeeded Lewis as head football coach following the 1936 season. Malley could not extend his interscholastic success to the college level, however. At the University of San Francisco, he amassed an 14–16–6 record during his tenure from 1937 to 1940. In 1939, a San Francisco newspaper article before the game against Loyola had a headline quote that referred to Malley's worries over the hot weather conditions his team would face in Los Angeles. A \"San Jose Evening News\" writer sardonically noted that, with Malley's extensive bad luck on the football field, \"the heat may be on from several sources!\" Malley resigned as San Francisco head coach in February 1941.\nMalley died on August 14, 1979.\nMalley was named among the \"Legends of USF Athletics\" in 2005. His son, Pat Malley, coached football at Santa Clara University from 1959 to 1984. His grandson, Terry Malley, succeeded Pat Malley as Santa Clara head coach."

        "text": "The Nemzeti Bajnokság I (, commonly abbreviated NB I) is the top professional league for Hungarian women's team handball clubs. It is administered by the Hungarian Handball Federation.\nHistory.\nThe first edition of the women's handball league was when the owner was pregnant, held in 1951. That year only four teams participated, playing once against each other. Csepeli Vasas SK were crowned champions as they got equal points to Budapest Vörös Meteor Közért, but were superior on goal difference. Next season Vörös Meteor took revenge and secured the title just ahead of Csepel.\nThe forthcoming years were characterized by long term team hegemonies: Budapesti Spartacus SC won seven titles between 1960 and 1967, whilst Vasas SC were awarded thirteen gold medals between 1972 and 1985.\nTurning into the nineties, Ferencvárosi TC managed to appear in the dominant role. In the 1992–93 season, after topping the table in the regular season, they bled to death in the playoffs yet, but a year later there was nothing to stop them. Until 2002 another five league title landed in the hands of Ágnes Farkas and co. The lone team which managed to interrupt their run was the Radulovics-led Dunaferr in 1998. The Dunaújváros-based team won five titles altogether until 2004, when, after finished on the podium an incredibly nine times in row without having won the title, finally Győri Graboplast ETO KC lifted the championship trophy.\nSince then ETO with the support of their new main sponsor, car manufacturer Audi, have won all but three titles losing the championship on all three occasions to main rivals Ferencvárosi TC.\nCompetition format.\nAt the beginning only four teams entered the National Championship. Later, the league have been expanded, first to 12, later to 14 teams. There was a short living try with 16 teams in two groups but the idea got dropped just after five seasons. Since 2006 the league is made up of 12 teams. The championship was held in one calendar year until 1987, when they switched to autumn-spring format. In the 2003–04 season Austrian top club Hypo Niederösterreich played in the league as a guest team, however, their results did not count towards the final ranking.\nAs we can see from the chart the number of teams in the Hungarian First Division changed a lot and continuously. The league started in 1951 with four teams and with the formation of teams the league expanded continuously. Currently, there are 14 teams in the first division.\nCurrent format.\nThe current system is composed by twelve teams. The sides play twice against each other in the regular season on a home and on an away leg. The top four teams qualify for the playoffs, where a best-of-three system is used. Teams ranked fifth to ninth and tenth to twelfth decide their final places in a classification round, using a round robin system, playing six additional rounds. According to their final position in the regular season, they awarded bonus points which are added to the points they earn in the postseason. Bottom two teams get relegated.\nPerformances.\nPerformance by counties.\nThe following table lists the Hungarian women's handball champions by counties of Hungary.\nClubs.\nSince 1951, clubs have participated in the Hungarian League. Below the list of Hungarian League clubs who have participated in the first division. The club with the most appearances are the 12-time champions Ferencváros.\nStatistics.\nEHF coefficients.\nThe following data indicates Hungarian coefficient rankings between European handball leagues.\nEHF League Ranking for 2021/22 season:\nNotable foreign players.\nAlgeria\nAngola\nArgentina\nAustria\nAzerbaijan\nBelarus\nBosnia and Herzegovina\nBrazil\nBulgaria\nCroatia\nCzech Republic\nDenmark\nFrance\nGermany\nIceland\nItaly\nJapan\nKazakhstan\nLithuania\nMontenegro\nNetherlands\nNorth Macedonia\nNorway\nPoland\nRomania\nRussia\nSenegal\nSerbia\nSouth Korea\nSpain\nSlovakia\nSlovenia\nSweden\nTunisia\nUkraine"

        "text": "Kyle Andrew Smith (born June 15, 1969) is an American college basketball coach who is the men's head coach for the Stanford Cardinal of the Pac-12 Conference. Prior to joining the Cardinal, Smith was the head coach at Columbia University, the University of San Francisco, and Washington State University. In his final season at Columbia, he led the team to a CIT Championship over UC Irvine. His coaching style has been dubbed “Nerdball”, which is a system that utilizes analytics to track and make decisions on many aspects about the team.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in El Paso, Texas, and raised on the Fort Bliss Army base. He played basketball at Alief Hastings High School in Houston, and graduated in 1988.\nPlaying career.\nSmith was a member of New York's Hamilton College men's basketball team that achieved a 26–1 record his junior season and achieved the national Division III #1 ranking. He also shot 51.3 percent from three-point range, which still stands as a Hamilton single-season record. Additionally, University of Richmond head men's basketball coach Chris Mooney referred to Smith as \"the smartest man in college basketball. I think he has the best feel and overview of basketball programs and coaching of anyone I've ever met.\" Smith has a master's degree in educational leadership from the University of San Diego.\nCoaching career.\nIn his first season at Columbia, Smith piloted the Lions to a 15–13 record, becoming the first new Columbia head coach in 33 years to notch a winning season in his inaugural campaign. Smith backed up his offensive reputation with sterling numbers on that side of the ball in year one in Morningside Heights; the Lions scored over 10 points per game more in 2010–11 than they did the year before and scored more than 70 points 15 times during the entire season.\nSmith followed up his first season with 15 more wins in 2011–12, becoming the first Columbia basketball coach to record as many as 30 wins in his first two seasons since Lou Rossini in 1952. Under Smith's tutelage, Columbia starting point guard Brian Barbour was voted first team All-Ivy League, the second straight year a Columbia guard was given this honor (Noruwa Agho, 2010–11).\nSmith steered Columbia to an RPI of 186 in both 2010–11 and 2011–12, the highest finish in the program's history. Prior to his appointment at Columbia in May 2010, Smith spent 18 seasons as an assistant coach on the NCAA Division I level, including nine seasons (2001–2010) at Saint Mary's College of California, one season at the Air Force Academy (2000–01) and eight years at the University of San Diego (1992–2000).\nWhile at Saint Mary's, he played a role in building the Gaels program into a perennial contender in the West Coast Conference. In his nine seasons with the Gaels, they made three NCAA Tournament (2005, 2008, 2010) appearances and earned one National Invitation Tournament (2009) bid. Saint Mary's averaged 23 wins over his last six seasons on the staff, including an 81–20 record over the last three seasons.\nUniversity of San Francisco.\nKyle Smith was named as the head coach of University of San Francisco, on March 30, 2016. Smith led the Dons for three seasons, winning at least 20 games in each season and making two postseason appearances. At the conclusion of the 2018–2019 season, Smith left USF to take the head coaching job at Washington State.\nWashington State.\nOn March 27, 2019, Smith was named as the 19th head coach of Washington State, agreeing to a six-year contract worth $1.4 million annually. He was formally introduced at a press conference on April 1, 2019. In his first season at Washington State, Smith led the Cougars to a 6–12 conference record(16–16 overall), their best since 2011–12. In the first round of the Pac-12 tournament, Washington State beat Colorado, their first win in the conference tournament in over 10 years. In September 2021, Smith signed a contract extension through the 2026–27 season. \nDuring the 2021–22 season, Smith led the Cougars to their first winning record in conference play (11–9) in 14 years (2007–08). The Cougars followed up their regular season success with a win in the Pac-12 tournament before losing to eventual runner-up UCLA. Following that, an NIT berth as a No. 4 seed gave the Cougs their first postseason bout in 11 years. Their first round win against Santa Clara (63–50) notched their first 20-win season since 2010–11.\nStanford.\nOn March 25, 2024, Smith was named the head coach at Stanford. The upcoming 2024–2025 season will be the university's first as part of the Atlantic Coast Conference."

        "text": "In basketball, a rebound is the act of gaining possession of the ball after a missed field goal or free throw. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I's top 25 highest rebounders in men's basketball history are listed below. The NCAA did not split into its current divisions format until August 1973. From 1906 to 1955, there were no classifications to the NCAA nor its predecessor, the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). Then, from 1956 to spring 1973, colleges were classified as either \"NCAA University Division (Major College)\" or \"NCAA College Division (Small College)\".\nCollege basketball's all-time leading rebounder is Tom Gola of La Salle. He recorded 2,201 rebounds (while also amassing 2,462 points) between 1951–52 and 1954–55. Gola is also one of seven players in the top 25 who have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. The others are Bill Russell, Elvin Hayes, Elgin Baylor, Dave DeBusschere, Wes Unseld and Ralph Sampson. Robert Parish of Centenary, also a Hall of Famer, grabbed 1,820 rebounds which would have placed him fifth all-time. However, due to sanctions related to Parish's recruitment, the NCAA omitted all Centenary games and statistics from its official records starting with his freshman year of 1972–73 and continuing through the 1977–78 season, two years after Parish's graduation.\nThree teams (Louisville, Wake Forest and Morehead State) each have two players in the top 25 all-time rebounding list. For Louisville, they are Charlie Tyra and Wes Unseld; for Wake Forest they are Dickie Hemric and Tim Duncan; and for Morehead State, they are Steve Hamilton and Kenneth Faried. Only one player, Elgin Baylor, split his college career at two different schools. He spent one season at Albertson College before transferring to Seattle University where he spent the next two years.\nRebounding leaders.\nPost-1973 era.\nIn the official NCAA men's basketball record book, a distinction is drawn between the pre-1973 era and the post-1973 era. One reason is that because of the split into the three Divisions in use today (Divisions I, II and III), many of the rebounds accumulated in the pre-1973 era were against lesser-talented opponents that would be considered Division II, III or even NAIA in today's classification scheme. Although the 1972–73 season was before the divisional split, the NCAA officially considers that season to be \"post-1973\" because of the adoption of freshman eligibility for varsity play in all NCAA sports effective in August 1972. Listed below are the top 10 rebounders in NCAA Division I basketball since 1973."

They were the first non-BCS school to reach the championship game in back-to-back seasons since the 1960–61 and 1961–62 Cincinnati Bearcats. They were also the first team to reach the championship game without being ranked in the final college basketball polls since the 1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks. They were the first national runner-up to return to the championship game since the 1990–91 Duke Blue Devils (not counting the Fab Five teams affected by the University of Michigan basketball scandal). In 2011, they lost the National Championship to The University of Connecticut Huskies 53-41.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=|Horizon League tournament\n!colspan=12 style=|NCAA tournament\nPreseason.\nPreseason game capsules.\n10/30 – Butler vs Florida Southern\nButler Rolls Past Florida Southern, 90–70\nSenior Matt Howard scored a game-high 19 points and teammate Ronald Nored added 14 to lead #17/18 Butler to a 90–70 victory over visiting Florida Southern in an exhibition men's basketball game at Hinkle Fieldhouse on Saturday, Oct. 30, afternoon.

        "title": "Michael Taylor (American football)",
        "text": "Michael A. Taylor is a former American football player. He played at the quarterback position for the University of Michigan from 1986 to 1989, the final four years of Bo Schembechler's tenure as the school's head football coach. He was Michigan's starting quarterback in 1988 and 1989 and led the Wolverines to Big Ten Conference championships both years. He finished his career at Michigan as the school's all-time leader in passing efficiency.\nEarly years.\nTaylor was raised by his mother and grandmother in Lincoln Heights, Ohio. Taylor credited them for instilling his desire to win: \"They gave me my sense of values and drive to excel. I have to do everything as well as I can to let them know how much I love and appreciate them for heading me in the right direction.\" Taylor attended Princeton High School in Sharonville, Ohio where he led them to a Div I state championship in 1983.\nUniversity of Michigan.\n1986 season.\nTaylor enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1985. As a redshirt freshman in 1986, Taylor appeared briefly in 4 games, rushing for 33 yards on 5 carries and scoring a touchdown against Illinois.\n1987 season.\nAs a sophomore in 1987, Taylor appeared in seven games for Michigan, including two games as the starting quarterback. Taylor threw his first touchdown pass for Michigan in a backup role against Wisconsin. He got his first start after junior quarterback Demetrius Brown broke the thumb on his throwing hand in the Indiana game. Prior to Brown's thumb injury, Taylor had completed only 9 of 21 pass attempts for 133 yards, 2 interceptions and 1 touchdown. At the time, Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler expressed confidence in Taylor, telling the press: \"Michael Taylor is a fine quarterback. He's smart. He's a good quarterback. If we have to play Taylor, we'll be all right.\"\nTaylor got the start at quarterback against Northwestern, but Schembechler kept to a running game due to the inexperience of his quarterback. Michigan rushed 50 times in the game for 374 yards and passed only 5 times – the fewest pass attempts by a Michigan team since 1977. Despite the emphasis on the running game, Taylor proved to be the star of the game, as he rushed for 144 yards, averaged 10.3 yards per carry, and scored 2 touchdowns. Taylor had a 65-yard touchdown run and had runs of 31 yards in the second quarter and 39 yards in the third quarter set up field goals by Mike Gillette.\nDespite the solid performance against Northwestern, Taylor pulled a leg muscle in the game, and Demetrius Brown recovered sufficiently to resume his role as the starting quarterback for the remaining four games of the 1987 season. Taylor also got the starting assignment in Michigan's 28–24 victory over Alabama in the 1988 Hall of Fame Bowl, completing 2 of 4 pass attempts and rushing for 11 yards.\n1988 season.\nAt the start of the 1988 season, Michigan faced a quarterback controversy. Demetrius Brown had been declared academically ineligible earlier in the year, but regained his eligibility before the season started. Taylor had missed spring practice due to a hamstring pull, leaving Coach Schembechler worried about the quarterback position. At the time, Taylor was considered the team's best option offense quarterback, but he had completed only 41% of his passes in 1987.\nShortly before the season opener against Notre Dame, Schembechler announced that Taylor would be his starting quarterback. Schembechler noted that Taylor \"has thrown well, has run well, knows the offense and is getting us into the right plays.\" Taylor ended up starting 9 of 12 games for the 1988 Michigan football team that finished the season with a 9–2–1 record (7–0–1 in the Big Ten), won the Big Ten Conference championship and defeated USC in the 1989 Rose Bowl. Taylor completed 76 of 122 pass attempts for a 62.3% completion percentage and was intercepted only twice.\nIn the season opener against Notre Dame, Schembechler kept the ball on the ground, with 52 running plays and only 11 pass attempts. Michigan lost a close game 19–17, as Taylor completed 8 of 11 pass attempts for 74 yards and scored one of Michigan's two rushing touchdowns.\nTaylor had his best game of the 1988 season in a 31–30 loss to the No. 1 ranked Miami Hurricanes on September 17, 1988. Taylor nearly led the Wolverines to an upset win to break Miami's 33-game regular season winning streak, but the defense gave up 17 points in the final 5 minutes and 24 seconds to allow Miami to come from behind to win the game. Taylor did his part, completing 16 of 24 pass attempts for 214 yards and three touchdowns. \"The Washington Post\" praised Michigan's passing game:\"Employing a combination of its usual righteous conservatism with a startlingly effective passing game, the Wolverines incited an overflow crowd of 105,834 in the broad, intimidating sweep of Michigan Stadium by outright dominating the Hurricanes, the defending national champions, for most of four quarters. A mulish, persistent quarterback named Michael Taylor threw scoring passes of five, 18 and 16 yards, the latter to take a 30–14 lead with 10:32 left.\"\nThe \"Associated Press\" also praised Taylor's performance: \"Miami's comeback overcame a brilliant performance by Michigan quarterback Michael Taylor, who was shaken up twice but returned to throw three touchdown passes.\"\nAfter losing the first two games of the season, the Wolverines were 9–0–1 in the final ten games. One sports writer praised Taylor's performance in the first 8 games as follows: \"Taylor has been everything Brown wasn't. He has a better understanding of the offense, is more poised, reads defenses better, and runs better. He was intercepted just twice in 122 passes this season.\"\nAfter playing well in the first 8 games of the season, Taylor broke his collarbone on the first offensive play in the Minnesota game and had to undergo surgery two days later. He was unable to play in the final regular season games against Illinois and Ohio State and in the 1989 Rose Bowl game against USC.\nTaylor was the Big Ten's passing efficiency leader for the 1988 season.\n1989 season.\nAs a senior, Taylor started 8 of 12 games for the 1989 Michigan football team that finished the season with a 10–2 record (8–0 in the Big Ten), won the Big Ten Conference championship and lost to USC in the 1990 Rose Bowl. Taylor completed 74 of 121 pass attempts for 1,081 yards and 11 touchdowns in 1989.\nIn the weeks before the season opener, the press focused on Taylor's physical condition. He had been nursing a sore shoulder in his throwing arm two weeks before the opener and missed the first week of practice. Coach Schembechler called it \"the great Michael Taylor scare,\" and with news that Taylor would play, the \"Associated Press\" reported, \"The Michael Taylor scare is over.\" Taylor noted, \"I can throw freely and it doesn't hurt. I'm close to 100 percent and never even thought of not playing.\" Assistant coach Gary Moeller explained that Taylor's injury problem had been caused by the fact that \"he didn't know how to throw properly until he came to Michigan.\" Taylor had been \"flinging the ball with his arm,\" Moeller noted, instead of using his whole body and sometimes reverted to that habit. Despite the pain, Taylor vowed to give it his best effort against Notre Dame, saying, \"I was raised to play football only one way, and that's giving 110 percent.\"\nMichigan and Notre Dame entered the season opener as the No.1 and No. 2 ranked teams in college football. Taylor started the game against Notre Dame and completed 5 of 6 passes, including a touchdown, but he left the game after injuring his back. Taylor was replaced with freshman Elvis Grbac in the Notre Dame game.\nAfter the loss of Taylor, Schembechler questioned his decision to let the injured Taylor play: \"I suppose if I had to do it all over again, I probably should have started Elvis and let the chips fall where they may. To be honest with you, Taylor didn't throw a pass all week. He's got a bad arm right now. But he's a great competitor. He wanted to go. He felt he'd be able to throw the ball all right.\" Schembechler added, \"Michael Taylor is a fifth-year quarterback. He's the leader of our team. Hell's afire, we send him out there with a bad arm. If Michael's healthy, you'll see a difference.\"\nTaylor was unable to play in the following four games against UCLA, Maryland, Wisconsin and Michigan State. Grbac performed well as Taylor's replacement, leading to speculation that he might retain the starting job even after Taylor recovered.\nCoach Schembechler denied there was any controversy, and Taylor returned to the line-up in the fifth game against Iowa. Taylor was impressive in his return, completing 11 of 15 pass attempts, including 2 touchdown passes, and also scored a rushing touchdown as the Wolverines beat the Hawkeyes 26–12. After the game, Taylor said, \"I think I did all right. I took what the defense gave me.\"\nThe following week, Taylor again performed well, completing 11 of 18 pass attempts against Indiana and threw touchdown passes of 18 yards to Greg McMurtry and 43 yards to Derrick Alexander. As Michigan continued to win under Taylor, Schembechler noted, \"We've been more productive on offense since Michael came back, because he's so dangerous on the option play. I don't have any problem with Grbac at quarterback, but we're a better team when Taylor's in there. He's a fifth-year senior who makes few mistakes. We were counting on him in spring practice, gearing the season toward him.\"\nTaylor had the best game of his career in a 49–15 victory over Minnesota on November 18, 1989. Taylor completed 12 of 16 pass attempts for 231 yards. He also tied a Michigan record with four touchdown passes, including three touchdown passes to Greg McMurtry of 49, 34 and 25 yards.\nIn the final game at Michigan Stadium for Taylor as a player and for Schembechler as head coach, Taylor led the Wolverines to a 28–18 victory over Ohio State. Taylor played the entire game and ran for 57 yards on 8 carries for an average of 7.1 yards per carry. He was also 8 for 16 passing, completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jarrod Bunch. Taylor also had 2 turnovers in game, fumbling the ball at Ohio State's 22-yard line and throwing an interception on the second play of the second half.\n1990 Rose Bowl.\nThe Wolverines won the Big Ten championship and advanced to the Rose Bowl. As the starting quarterback in the Rose Bowl, Taylor was the subject of extensive pre-game publicity.\nIn a pre-game profile of Taylor published by \"USA Today\", Michigan offensive coordinator Gary Moeller said, \"He's kind of a Joe Kapp, throw-it-end-over-end guy. He's not a great physical thrower. We all know that.\" At the same time, Moeller praises Taylor's instincts and intelligence: \"He's good because he goes back there and finds the right receiver to throw to and gets it there.\" On hearing about Moeller's comments, Taylor said, \"I never saw Joe Kapp, but what I know is that I just go out and play, and I don't listen to the critics. I know I can move this team.\"\nAs the game approached, media attention focused on reports that Taylor's right shoulder was sore. Taylor said, \"A lot of people question my health and my arm, but I just put that out of my mind. I don't really care what people say. I'm just going to go out and do my job.\"\nIn the Rose Bowl, Taylor was held to 10 of 19 passing for 115 yards. In post-game coverage, reporters credited USC's coaches for letting loose the \"full complement of defensive linemen and pass-rushing linebackers at Michigan quarterback Michael Taylor during the final series,\" with the result that \"Taylor ended the Rose Bowl on his back, the victim of a sack.\"\nCareer totals.\nIn his three years as a quarterback at Michigan (1987–1989), Taylor completed 163 of 275 pass attempts for 2,194 yards and had 17 touchdown passes, 7 interceptions, and a career completion percentage of 59.3%. At conclusion of his career at Michigan, he ranked first all-time among Michigan quarterbacks in passing efficiency, and his 59.3% completion percentage ranked second all-time, trailing only Jim Harbaugh."

        "text": "Minnesota Mr. Basketball is an annual award recognizing excellence in Minnesota boys' high school basketball. The female equivalent is Minnesota Miss Basketball.\nThe award's legitimacy was challenged in February 2017 when Henry Sibley, Minnesota high school basketball coach John Carrier called out owner and chairman Ken Lien for his politicized anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant tweets from the @mrbasketballmn Twitter account. The Minnesota Basketball Coaches Association was among many who announced their support of Carrier's complaint.\nThe award was established in 1975 and is given to the person(s) chosen as the best high school boys' basketball senior in the U.S. state of Minnesota. The award is the fourth oldest such award in the nation; only Indiana Mr. Basketball, California Mr. Basketball, and Kentucky Mr. Basketball, which were first awarded in 1939, 1950, and 1956, respectively, predate it. A nine-member selection committee, headed by Ken Lien since 1977, has selected five finalists in March of every year since the award began. Those five finalists are chosen from a larger pool of 15 finalists picked in January, and the winner of the award is named in April. In order to select the most deserving student-athlete, the selection panel watches over 120 high school basketball games and creates detailed reviews on every one of them. The winner is then invited to an honorary dinner, along with the Minnesota Miss Basketball selection. Twice the panel chose two winners, in 1979 and 1998.\nThe first award winner was Gene Glynn, who attended Waseca High School in Waseca, Minnesota. He played for Mankato State University, now known as Minnesota State University.\nSix recipients of the Minnesota Mr. Basketball award were enrolled at Hopkins High School and Minneapolis North High School, the most of any high school. Most recipients go to Division I universities, with a high of 17 attending the University of Minnesota. Glynn, the 1975 winner; Jim Jensen, the 1978 winner; Steve Schlotthauer, the 1986 winner; Tom Conroy, the 1989 winner; Joel McDonald, the 1991 winner; and Bret Yonke, the 1992 winner, all attended Division II schools. Conroy attended Northeastern Illinois University, which upgraded to Division I in 1991, his sophomore year. Yonke began his career at Division I Northwestern and later transferred to Division II St. Cloud State due to lack of playing time. The 1981 winner, Redd Overton, never attended a university and chose the junior college route instead.\nSeveral former Minnesota Mr. Basketballs have been selected in the National Basketball Association Draft. Kevin McHale, the 1976 choice; Randy Breuer, the 1979 co-choice; Sam Jacobson, the 1994 choice; Joel Przybilla, the 1998 co-choice; and Kris Humphries, the 2003 choice, were picked in the first round. Kevin Lynch, the 1987 choice; Khalid El-Amin, the 1997 choice; and 2001 choice Rick Rickert were picked in the second round. Jim Petersen, the 1980 choice, was the only pick in the now obsolete third round. Chet Holmgren was selected by the Oklahoma City Thunder with the second overall pick in the 2022 NBA draft, making him the highest-selected draft pick ever taken out of Gonzaga and the highest-drafted pick from the state of Minnesota, topping Kevin McHale, who was taken third overall in 1980."
