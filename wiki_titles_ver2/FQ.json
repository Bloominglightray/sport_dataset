        "title": "Esports Arena",
        "text": "Esports Arena is a chain of indoor arenas and event centers dedicated to esports. The buildings are specifically intended to host esports tournaments and events. The first location, Esports Arena Orange County, opened in Santa Ana, California, in 2015 and seats 1,400 people. In addition to hosting professional events, amateur events are also held at the arenas. Multiple Esports Arena venues have since been established worldwide, partially funded by the Chinese sports and video game company partnership Allied Esports.\nHistory.\nFormer military intelligence officer Paul Ward started thinking about starting a major video game venue in 2010. He and his childhood friend Tyler Endres had fond memories of attending LAN parties and small-scale video game competitions while growing up, but were disappointed by the existing venues for such events as adults. Paul Ward and Tyler Endres, who are both 29, met in middle school playing basketball, and later attended nearby Azusa Pacific University together, but are gamers at heart. \"Our kitchen in college was TVs and Xboxes,\" said Endres, and they ran impromptu tournaments whenever possible.\nEsports Arena was founded by Ward and Endres as a location where amateur players can practice and mingle. The two initially had trouble finding a venue for their idea, though their pitch was positively received by Santa Ana building owner Jack Jakosky, who, despite not playing video games himself, saw potential in the idea. In order to afford a 10-year lease on the building, Ward and Erdes received a Small Business Administration loan, checks from friends and family, and an anonymous large investment.\nThe space they built — much of it by hand, laying carpet and running heavy-duty internet infrastructure themselves — is relatively spartan, with concrete floors and few fixed objects. \"It needs to be modular,\" Ward said, because the arena is constantly hosting events of different sizes with different needs. Knowing the crucial difference between gaming and esports is at the heart of the concept. According to the Dutch research shop Newzoo, there will be 2.3 billion gamers worldwide by December 2017, but 191 million esports enthusiasts and 194 million occasional viewers.\nThe Esports Arena, the country's first venue opened specifically for esports competitions, opened in 2015. The building opened on October 3, 2015, to host a \"Hearthstone\" tournament with a $20,000 USD prize pool. The 15,000 square-feet venue is housed in an old renovated brick building in downtown Santa Ana and holds slightly under 1,000 people. Though major leagues are hosted in the Esports Arena, the building is primarily used as a \"gym\", offering memberships and passes to amateur gamers. Technology companies Corsair, Eizo and CyberPowerPC sponsored the gaming equipment, which included 130 computer stations and 64 Xbox consoles when the building was opened.\nAs it was opened, Ward and Endres planned to livestream daily amateur matches. Commentators and award ceremonies of such events would then create a certain atmosphere. In an interview with the \"Los Angeles Times\", Endres stated that the \"we're selling an experience, not Internet time.\"\nBy August 2016, Allied invested in Esports Arena and announced plans for the Oakland location to get started on the national expansion. Allied is now billing the planned Vegas location as the center of its worldwide network of esports.\nLocations.\nIn August 2016, Ward and Endres received a multimillion-dollar investment from five Chinese sports and video game companies – together known as Allied Esports – in order open a second Esports Arena on Jack London Square in Oakland. The deal marked the beginning of a network of arenas partially funded by Allied Esports. The 16,000 square-feet Oakland location opened in May 2018.\nA 30,000 square-meter Esports Arena was established in the Luxor Hotel in Las Vegas in 2018, funded by Allied Esports and MGM Resorts International. Jud Hannigan of Allied Esports described Esports Arena Las Vegas as the esports equivalent of the Yankee Stadium, Madison Square Garden, or Wembley. Chris Glove, co-director of the Nevada Esports Alliance, stated that the Las Vegas location \"will start to give some shape to the esports identity of Las Vegas.\" The naming rights were sold to gaming headset company HyperX, and HyperX Esports Arena Las Vegas opened on March 22, 2018.\nEvents.\nEsports Arena Orange County has hosted various major tournaments, including the finals of the 2015 \"Vainglory (video game)\" season and SoCal Regionals 2016. The Esports Arena hosted the preliminary rounds of the 2016 Capcom Cup.\nThe Santa Ana facility has hosted live tournaments in titles such as Nintendo's \"Super Smash Bros.\" and Blizzard Entertainment's \"Heroes of the Storm.\" The arena is also open to casual gamers. Esports Arena also has locations in select Walmart stores, which host small-scale events and tournaments."

The team was coached by Jerry York, '67, his twenty-third season behind the bench at Boston College. The Eagles played their home games at Kelley Rink on the campus of Boston College, competing in Hockey East.\nThe Eagles competed in three tournaments during the 2016–17 season, the first of which took place during the traditional opening of the college hockey season at the 20th annual Ice Breaker Classic. Played on October 7 and 8 at Magness Arena in Denver, Colorado, the tournament showcased the Eagles playing Air Force in the first round, where they would lose a tight 2–1 match. Boston College faced host Denver in the consolation round, picking up a 3–1 victory for their first win of the season. Air Force would defeat Ohio State in the championship. The Eagles had previously won the ice breaker tournament three times; making their fifth appearance this season. The second tournament of the season took place during the holiday break, where the Eagles made the trip to the PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania for their second appearance in the Three Rivers Classic in its fifth annual year. The Eagles fell 3–1 to the Quinnipiac Bobcats in the opening round, but picked up the 3rd-place result against Ferris State in the consolation round, winning the (unofficial) shootout of the (official) 1–1 tie. Boston College previously won the title in their first appearance at the tournament in 2012.

They advanced to the Championship of the Hockey East tournament, but would fall to the UMass Lowell River Hawks by a score of 4–3.

        "text": "Joseph Alfred George Ward known as George Ward (born 19 March 1885 - death registered Quarter 2 1962) was a rugby union hooker who played 361 games for Leicester Tigers between 1910 and 1926 and six times for England in 1913 and 1914.\nWard made his Leicester debut on 9 March 1910 in a 20-0 win away to Moseley. Ward featured 5 times in the remaining 8 games of the season and was a regular player in the 1910–1911 season playing in 34 of 42 games. Ward was selected for Midlands Counties against the touring Springboks in 1912 and made his England debut on 18 January 1913 against at Cardiff. Ward played 3 times for England in their 1913 grandslam, missing the match against Ireland due to the travel, though there was the suggestion international rugby did not appeal to him. Nevertheless, Ward was also a member of 1914 England grandslam team, again missing the one match played overseas, this time in France.\nWard won the Midlands Counties Cup with Leicester in 1912 and 1913. He was vice-captain of the club for 10 years between 1918 and 1928, deputising regularly for Percy Lawrie. Ward became the 6th player to feature in 300 games for Leicester Tigers when he played against Nuneaton on 27 October 1923; he is the oldest player when making his 300th appearance for the club at 38 years and 222 days old and still has the 14th most appearances for the club. Later in the same season, also against Nuneaton on 31 March 1924, Ward became the club's oldest captain at 39 years and 12 days old, the record stood until 16 November 2014 when Brad Thorn captained Tigers for the only time.\nSources.\nFarmer,Stuart &amp; Hands, David \"Tigers-Official History of Leicester Football Club\" (The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation )"

        "text": "The men's quadruple sculls competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at took place at Lake Casitas, California, United States of America.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of two main rounds (heats and finals) as well as a repechage. The 10 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 5 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the \"A\" final (1st through 6th place). The remaining 8 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured two heats, with 4 boats in each heat. The top two boats in each repechage heat went to the \"A\" final. The remaining 4 boats (3rd and 4th placers in the repechage heats) competed in the \"B\" final for 7th through 10th place.\nAll races were over a 2000 metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on July 31. It was a warm day (23 °C); the wind was calm for the first heat but picked up to a 1.1 m/s southwest wind for the second. The winner of each heat advanced to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nHeat 1.\nThe first heat was a close competition between Australia and Spain for the single direct-advancement spot. Spain led early, by 0.22 seconds at 500 metres and by 0.32 seconds at 1000 metres. But Australia took control in the second half of the race, leading by 0.84 seconds at 1500 metres and finishing with a comfortable 2.42 second margin. The other three boats were static in their positioning, with the Netherlands third, the United States fourth, and Argentina fifth at each of the quarter marks and at the finish.\nHeat 2.\nThe second heat saw another close contest for first place. West Germany led France by a quarter-second at the 500 metre mark. By the halfway point, Italy had jumped from third to first, with France dropping from first to third. That order held through the 1500 metre mark, but the Germans passed Italy (and Canada passed France) over the final stretch. Norway trailed from start to finish.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on August 2. It was another warm day (24 °C); the wind was a .5 m/s southwest wind. The top two boats in each repechage heat advanced to the \"A\" final, with all others going to the \"B\" final (out of medal contention).\nRepechage heat 1.\nIn the first repechage heat, the two European boats started strong while the two boats from North America lagged behind initially. After the halfway mark (at which Spain led Norway by slightly over a second, Canada by two and a quarter seconds, and the United States by two and a half seconds), the Canadian team made their break. The Canadians narrowed the distance by 1500 metres and overtook both Norway and Spain in the final 500 metres. The contest then became between the two European squads for the second advancement place; Norway, however, was never able to close that one-second gap and finished out of the \"A\" final. The United States, close behind Canada at halfway, was unable to make the same break and fell behind the rest of the field.\nRepechage heat 2.\nThe second repechage heat was another three-way race for the two \"A\" final spots, with Argentina well out of the running by halfway. The Netherlands took the early lead, maintaining it through the 1000 metre mark. Italy had caught and passed the Dutch team by 1500 metres, with France still running third. Over the last 500 metres, France passed the Netherlands as well to force the latter out of the top two. France also passed Italy during that last quarter of the race, winning the heat.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final, for 7th through 10th place, was held on August 3. It was another warm day (23 °C) with 0.5 m/s east winds. The top three finishers were separated by less than a second, while Argentina was well back (over 20 seconds behind the third-place team) for a final placement of 10th and last. The Dutch boat was the early leader, followed closely by the Americans. By halfway, the United States had taken the lead and Norway was pressing the Netherlands for second. The Americans would not relinquish the lead, taking 7th overall. Norway passed the Netherlands between 1000 and 1500 metres, taking 8th by fighting off a last-quarter push back from the Dutch, who finished 9th overall. Argentina competed well over the first quarter of the course (and was ahead of Norway at the 500 metre mark), but fell 6 seconds behind by halfway and continued to lag.\nFinal A.\nThe \"A\" final was held on August 5. The temperature was cooler, at 18 °C, and the wind was now 0.5 m/s east-northeast. Australia led from the start, with West Germany consistently second and Canada pushing from a slower beginning (5th at 500 metres and at 1000 metres, 3rd at 1500 metres) to make it a three-way race over the last quarter of the course. Both West Germany and Canada gained on Australia in the final 500 metres, but only the Germans were able to catch the Australians to take the gold medal. Canada settled for bronze. Italy, which had been in third until passed by Canada, fought off a late push from France for fourth place. By contrast, Spain, which had been fourth until Canada's surge, fell behind the French and finished sixth."

        "text": "Bryan James Harper (born December 29, 1989) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Harper spent eight seasons in the Washington Nationals organization. He is the older brother of Phillies first baseman Bryce Harper.\nEarly life.\nGrowing up in Las Vegas, Nevada, Harper played a number of sports, including basketball and American football as well as baseball. Bryce Harper has said that the reason he bats left-handed is because he always wanted to be like his older brother, who throws left-handed. The younger Harper said he tried throwing left-handed when he was young, but being naturally right-handed, he was \"terrible\" at it, so he settled for hitting from the left side instead.\nBaseball career.\nHigh school and college.\nHarper attended Las Vegas High School, pitching for the school's baseball team. He was drafted in the 2008 Major League Baseball draft in the 31st round by the Washington Nationals, but he chose not to sign.\nAfter graduating from high school, Harper briefly relocated out-of-state to pitch at California State University, Northridge, for the Cal State Northridge Matadors before transferring back to Las Vegas to attend the College of Southern Nevada. The Harper brothers were teammates on the Las Vegas High baseball team as well as at Southern Nevada, a junior college that Bryce Harper attended early so that he could sign with a major league team as quickly as possible. At the time, Bryce was a catcher, so the Harper brothers would often form the Coyotes' battery. On the Coyotes baseball team, they were managed by Tim Chambers, who later praised Bryan Harper's work ethic and professionalism in spite of being overshadowed by his younger brother. Harper acknowledged in a 2015 interview that he has \"never been the uber-prospect like my brother has\", but he said he focused on his pitching and was consistently able to get batters out.\nBryan Harper pitched in the 2010 JUCO World Series, with Bryce Harper as his catcher, earning the win in an 18-1 blowout of Faulkner State Community College in the second round of the tournament. After Bryce was ejected and suspended later in the tournament, Bryan Harper got to pitch in an elimination game versus Iowa Western Community College. While the Coyotes led into the ninth inning, the team's closer gave up a walk-off home run, ending their playoff run.\nThe Harper brothers spent just one year together at Southern Nevada before Bryce was drafted in the 2010 Major League Baseball draft. Although Chambers hoped Bryan Harper would be picked up by the Nationals again in a later round of the draft, believing he could help his younger brother make the transition to professional baseball, he was ultimately selected in the 27th round by the Chicago Cubs.\nWhile Bryce Harper, having been taken by the Nationals with the first overall draft pick, chose to sign and become a member of the Nationals organization, Bryan Harper declined to sign with the Cubs. He instead went to the University of South Carolina, where he pitched in relief for the Gamecocks as a setup man. He won the 2011 College World Series with South Carolina. During that 2011 season with South Carolina, he recorded a 5.40 ERA over 18 1/3 innings. He later admitted he \"didn't pitch the best\" as a Gamecock, but he said the additional year of college helped with his maturity.\nWashington Nationals.\nHarper was subsequently drafted by the Nationals in the 31st round of the 2008 Major League Baseball draft out of Las Vegas High School, but he chose not to sign. He was then drafted in the 27th round of the 2010 MLB draft—in which his younger brother Bryce was selected first overall by the Nationals—by the Chicago Cubs out of the College of Southern Nevada but again did not sign. After Harper transferred to the University of South Carolina, he was drafted again by the Nationals in the 2011 MLB draft in the 30th round. Feeling he was ready at that point to play professionally, he agreed to terms, joining his brother in the organization.\nWhile Bryce Harper, who was quickly converted from catching to playing in the outfield, shot through the Nationals organization—he made his major league debut in April 2012—Bryan Harper's progression was slower. He spent the 2012 season with the Low-A Auburn Doubledays and the 2013 season with the Class-A Hagerstown Suns, working exclusively out of the bullpen. Starting in the 2014 season, he began to advance into the high minor leagues, ending the year with the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators and appearing briefly in the 2015 season with the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs, a step away from the major leagues. After spending the first two months of the 2016 season back with the Senators and recording a 1.50 ERA over 24 innings pitched, including 16 out of 20 scoreless appearances, Harper was promoted again to the Chiefs in June.\nAfter pitching to a 2.95 ERA over 21 1/3 innings with the Chiefs in 2016, Harper was shut down in August with a forearm strain. He was ruled out for the season, ending any chance of being called up to the Nationals that year, and in November, he underwent Tommy John surgery, an operation expected to rule him out for the 2017 season as well. As a result of the surgery, he was not added to the 40-man roster after the 2016 season as had been previously expected, according to \"The Washington Post\".\nHarper re-signed with the Nationals after the 2017 season and was invited to major league spring training in 2018 for the first time, vying for a spot in the Washington bullpen. He spent the 2018 regular season with Harrisburg, making 44 relief appearances. He became a free agent following the season.\nLancaster Barnstormers.\nOn March 22, 2019, Harper signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the independent Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He became a free agent following the season. \nPitching style.\nAt 6-foot-5, Bryan Harper stands two inches taller than Bryce Harper. Unlike Bryce, he throws left-handed. While his fastball velocity sat in the mid-80s when he was pitching for the University of South Carolina in 2011, he was throwing in the low 90s with the Syracuse Chiefs in 2016 prior to undergoing Tommy John surgery. His pitching arsenal includes a fastball, curveball, slider, and changeup."

        "text": "Miguel Angel Díaz (born November 28, 1994) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher in the Houston Astros organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres, Detroit Tigers, and Astros.\nCareer.\nMilwaukee Brewers.\nDíaz signed with the Milwaukee Brewers as an international free agent on December 1, 2011. He pitched in the Dominican Summer League as a 17- and 18-year old, and then spent the 2014 and 2015 seasons in the rookie-level Arizona League. In 2016, he worked in the Single–A Midwest League, starting 15 games and making 11 more appearances out of the bullpen with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.\nSan Diego Padres.\nDíaz was selected by the Minnesota Twins with the first pick of the 2016 Rule 5 draft and was then traded to the San Diego Padres. Díaz made the Padres' 2017 Opening Day roster and made his Major League debut on Opening Day. Díaz was initially used as a reliever, but transitioned into a starter role in June. While making his third start, Díaz suffered a forearm strain and ended up on the disabled list. He returned to the Padres in September, again pitching in relief. For the 2017 season, he totaled 33 strikeouts in 41 innings and a 7.34 ERA.\nIn 2018, the Padres intended to develop Díaz as a starter, and he was optioned early in the spring to minor league camp. Díaz began the season with the Double-A San Antonio Missions, where the Padres tried to stretch out his arm, and then was promoted to Triple-A El Paso in mid-May. He was moved back to San Antonio in June after struggling with El Paso.\nThe Padres called up Díaz for a single game at the beginning of July to help rest an over-extended bullpen. Díaz struck out four batters in one of the two scoreless innings he pitched, becoming only the second Padre to accomplish the feat. Díaz returned to the Major League club in mid-August and stayed with the team for the remainder of the season, working out of the bullpen. He finished with a 4.82 ERA, 30 strike-outs, and 12 walks in 18 innings at the big league level. In his 65 innings with San Antonio, he had a 2.35 ERA and 66 strike-outs versus 30 walks. After the season, Díaz was placed in the Arizona Fall League to improve his command and work out mechanical flaws.\nOn December 2, 2019, Díaz was non-tendered and became a free agent. He re-signed with San Diego the next day on a minor league contract that included an invitation to Spring Training. Díaz did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn February 12, 2021, Díaz signed with the San Diego Padres organization on a minor league deal that included an invitation to Spring Training. On April 30, 2021, Díaz was selected to the active roster. He made his season debut on May 3 as the starting pitcher against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Díaz made 25 appearances for San Diego in 2021, posting a 3.64 ERA with 46 strikeouts in 42.0 innings of work. On October 30, Díaz was outrighted off of the 40-man roster and elected free agency on November 7.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn March 12, 2022, Díaz signed a minor league contract with the Detroit Tigers. Diaz spent most of 2022 playing for the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens, pitching in 58 games and posting a 4-5 record and 4.29 ERA with 69 strikeouts and 7 saves in 65.0 innings pitched. On September 29, Diaz's contract was selected by the Tigers. \nOn November 15, Díaz was designated for assignment by the Tigers. On November 18, Díaz was non–tendered and became a free agent. He re-signed a minor league deal on November 29. In 49 games for Triple–A Toledo, he registered a 5.05 ERA with 73 strikeouts and 14 saves in 57.0 innings of work. On September 1, 2023, Díaz was selected to the major league roster. In 12 relief outings, he posted a strong 0.64 ERA with 16 strikeouts across 14 innings pitched.\nOn March 28, 2024, Díaz was designated for assignment after failing to make Detroit's Opening Day roster.\nHouston Astros.\nOn April 4, 2024, Díaz was claimed off waivers by the Houston Astros. He made one scoreless outing before being designated for assignment on April 8. On April 11, Díaz cleared waivers and was sent outright to the Triple–A Sugar Land Space Cowboys; however he subsequently rejected the assignment and elected free agency. He re–signed with the Astros on a minor league contract the next day."

It was run on November 2, 2013 at Santa Anita race track in Arcadia, California for a purse of $5,000,000.\nIn a photo finish that was later voted the NTRA Moment of the Year, Mucho Macho Man held off late charges from Will Take Charge and Declaration of War to win by a nose. Favored Game On Dude finished ninth.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nGame On Dude was the favorite for the Classic after winning six straight starts leading up to the race, including California's three most prestigious races for older horses – the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic. A win at the Breeders' Cup would have made Game On Dude the favorite for Horse of the Year honors.\nThe second choice was Mucho Macho Man, who had finished second in the 2012 Classic. He was pulled up in his first start of 2013, suffering from what was later determined to be a respiratory illness. He missed months of training while recovering, then returned in the summer with two third place finishes on the East Coast. Shipping to California to prep for the Classic, Mucho Macho Man posted an impressive win in the Awesome Again Stakes.\nFacing them was a highly competitive field, including:\nRace description.\nGame On Dude went to the early lead, joined by Fort Larned and longshot Moreno. Setting a brisk pace, the three exchanged leads for the first three-quarters of a mile before first Moreno, then Game On Dude started to fall back. Meanwhile, Mucho Macho Man raced a few lengths behind until starting his move while racing wide on the final turn, moving to the lead with a quarter of a mile to go. As they entered the stretch, Declaration of War failed to change leads but still moved into second, slowly closing ground on the leader. Will Take Charge also started making up ground on the turn while running six wide. As they approached the finish, the gap between the three horses narrowed until the final stride, where the result was too close to call with the naked eye. A photo finish showed Mucho Macho Man had held on to win by inches, with Will Take Charge a head (roughly a foot) in front of Declaration of War. The finish was later named the NTRA Moment of the Year.\nIt was the first Classic win for jockey Gary Stevens, who had resumed racing in 2013 at age 50 after having retired seven years earlier due to a series of injuries. \"This is a dream come true,\" he said. \"This is the one race missing from my résumé.\"\nKatherine Ritvo became the first female trainer to win the Classic, an especially noteworthy feat for a woman who had undergone a heart transplant in 2008. Ritvo gave credit to the horse and rider. \"When Gary waved the stick (after the finish), I figured he won,\" she added. \"He got a great trip. Gary did a fantastic job. When he used 'Macho,' 'Macho' showed up. He is a good horse. I'm excited. If I didn't have the support of my family, I wouldn't be here.\"\nMucho Macho Man was later awarded the Eclipse Award for Champion older male horse, although he lost out in Horse of the Year balloting to turf horse Wise Dan. Will Take Charge's second place finish helped him earn the title for Champion three-year-old colt.\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.39; – 0:46.36; – 1:10.23; mile – 1:34.84; final – 2:00.72.\nFractional Splits: (:23.39) (:22.97) (:23.87) (:24.61) (:25.88)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

More precisely the laboratory compared the result of test method A: \"Autoradiography — visual inspection of light emitted from a strip displaying the isoelectric profile for EPO\" (published in the Nature journal as the first EPO detection method in June 2000), with the result of test method B: \"Percentage of basic isoforms — using an ultra-sensitive camera that by percentage quantify the light intensity emitted from each of the isoelectric bands\" (pioneered at the Olympics in September 2000, with values above 80% classified as positive, but the laboratory applying an 85% threshold for retrospective samples — to be absolutely certain that no false-positives can occur when analyzing on samples stored for multiple years). For those samples with enough urine left, these results of test method A+B were finally also compared with the best and latest test method C: \"Statistical discriminant analysis — taking account all the band profiles by statistical distinguish calculations for each band\" (which feature both higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to test method B).\nAt first, the rider names with a positive sample in the retrospective test were not made public, because this extra test had only been conducted as scientific research, with the purpose of validating the newest invented EPO-test method based on \"statistical discriminant analysis\". On 23 August 2005, only one day after the confidential test report had been submitted by the test laboratory LNDD to WADA and the French Ministry for Sports, the French newspaper L'Équipe however reported, that after having access to all Lance Armstrong's Sample IDs, they had managed to link him to 6 out of the 12 \"definitely EPO-positive\" samples. The phrase \"definitely EPO-positive\" referred to that all three applied test methods (A+B+C) had returned a positive result, and it was reported Armstrong's six samples satisfying this requirement had been collected on the following dates: 3+4+13+14+16+18 July 1999. From the leaked report it was also possible to conclude, that all of the four unidentified riders tested at the Prologue on top of the list, had submitted samples being EPO positive by all three applied test methods. As it was known from earlier press reports, that only four named riders (Beltran, Castelblanco, Hamburger and Armstrong) had been tested in the Prologue, they were all identified as having tested EPO-positive.\nIn response, UCI published the so-called Vrijman report in May 2006, where they alleged WADA had been responsible for the leak of the confidential test report to the press, and had been plotting against Lance Armstrong when they asked the French laboratory to note sample IDs in their confidential report, as Vrijman suspected they already had inside knowledge of some journalists being in possession of Armstrongs confidential doping forms — knowing that this all together could be used to link him to the positive samples. However, a few days later, WADA published a full written reply to completely rebut this accusation, and was moreover able to prove the journalist in fact had received the Armstrong doping forms by legal ways, from UCI itself — with Armstrong's written consent — and without any help/interference by WADA.\nIn July 2013, the antidoping committee of the French Senate decided it would benefit the current doping fight to shed some more light on the past, and so decided — as part of their \"Commission of Inquiry into the effectiveness of the fight against doping\" report — to publish all of the 1998 rider doping forms and some of the 1999 rider doping forms, along with the result of the retrospective test of the 1998+1999 samples, which made name identification possible for the various sample IDs. This publication revealed for the 1999 samples, that 13 of the 20 positive samples belonged to 6 riders (Lance Armstrong, Kevin Livingston, Manuel Beltrán, José Castelblanco, Bo Hamburger, and Wladimir Belli), with the remaining 7 positive samples still not identified. Beside of the 20 positive samples, 34 were reported to have tested negative, and the remaining 30 samples were inconclusive due to sample degradation.\nConfessions.\nAmong the riders testing EPO positive during the 1999 Tour, the following riders have confessed indeed to be EPO positive:\nAmong the riders in the race who never had their samples tested doping positive, the following nevertheless later on confessed also to have doped in preparation/during the 1999 Tour de France:\nChristophe Bassons.\nFrench rider Christophe Bassons had come to be known as one of the few riders of the Festina scandal who was not doping. During the 1999 tour he wrote some articles about cycling, the tour, and about doping, finding the speeds to be \"suspicious\". The peloton began to turn against him, refusing to speak to him, and otherwise shunning him.\nStage 10 occurred on July 14 and was from Sestrieres to Alpe d'Huez. Bassons would later tell the story of this stage to media, including an October 2012 interview with the BBC. He said that nobody had been talking to him. The entire peloton planned to ride slow for the first 100 km without telling him. Bassons only heard about this because a mechanic from his team told him. Bassons decided he was \"fed up\" and decided to ride ahead of the others (\"attacked from the start\"). As they came to a flat spot, \"all of the teams rode together to close me down\". As the teams rode by him, they looked at him.\n\" . . . and then Lance Armstrong reached me. He grabbed me by the shoulder, because he knew that everyone would be watching, and he knew that at that moment, he could show everyone that he was the boss. He stopped me, and he said what I was saying wasn't true, what I was saying was bad for cycling, that I mustn't say it, that I had no right to be a professional cyclist, that I should quit cycling, that I should quit the tour, and finished by saying [*beep*] you. . . . I was depressed for 6 months. I was crying all of the time. I was in a really bad way.\" – \"Bassons, on BBC Radio 5, 2012 10 15\"\nIn 2011/2012, after investigations into past doping in cycling, especially the 2012 USADA report on Armstrong's US Postal Service team, the media began to re-tell Bassons story. In one interview for the BBC, Armstrong teammate Tyler Hamilton publicly apologized for being part of the peloton that shunned him, saying that he was \"100% wrong\" not to talk to him. Bassons said \"that's life, it's nothing. I don't begrudge Hamilton. I understand.\"\nDavid Walsh would later claim that Armstrong's treatment of Bassons was what first raised doubts about Armstrong in his mind. These doubts culminated in the 2004 book \"L. A. Confidentiel\" which he co-wrote with Pierre Ballester. It contained testimony from Emma O'Reilly (US Postal soigneur) and others about Armstrong's alleged doping, including during the 1999 tour."

        "title": "Doping at the 1998 Tour de France",
        "text": "The year in which the 1998 Tour de France took place marked the moment when cycling was fundamentally shattered by doping revelations. Paradoxically no riders were caught failing drug tests by any of the ordinary doping controls in place at the time. Nevertheless, several police searches and interrogations managed to prove existence of organized doping at the two teams Festina and TVM, who consequently had to withdraw from the race. After stage 16, the police also forced the virtual mountain jersey holder Rodolfo Massi to leave the race, due to having found illegal corticosteroids in his hotel room. The intensive police work then led to a peloton strike at stage 17, with a fallout of four Spanish teams and one Italian team deciding to leave the race in protest.\nMany years later, retrospective tests and rider confessions confirmed the common suspicion that consumption of EPO had not been limited to those being caught by the police, but in fact was something the majority of the peloton had used at this point of time.\nPolice investigations and arrests.\nThree days ahead of the Tour start, the masseur of Team Festina, Willy Voet, was found at the Belgian border to have his car full of large quantities of syringes and controlled substances, including narcotics, erythropoietin (EPO), growth hormones, testosterone and amphetamines. When raiding the Festina headquarters in France, the police also found a document with systematic drug programmes for the Festina riders. As the Tour had started in Ireland, the French police waited to the first stage in France before arresting the Festina Team's directeur sportif and doctor: and Eric Rijckaert. Faced by the evidence, Roussel and Rijckaert soon confessed, leading to all nine Festina riders (incl. notable riders such as 1997 runner-up Richard Virenque, Alex Zülle and Christophe Moreau), being forced to withdraw after stage 6.\nAt the first rest day, after stage 11, the Festina affair got extended, with several other teams being searched by the police, and a second police investigation leading to long interrogations of TVM riders and imprisonment of the three TVM staffs: Cees Priem (manager), Andrei Mikhailov (doctor) and Jan Moors (soigneur). As a reaction to the treatment by the French police, the peloton staged a solidarity sit-down protest both during stage 12 and stage 17. The Tour directors later nullified the results of stage 17, as the peloton in a gesture had let all TVM-riders pass the finish line a couple of seconds ahead of the peloton. All four Spanish teams (ONCE, Banesto, Vitalicio Seguros, Kelme) and one Italian team (Riso Scotti) even decided to pull out of the race, at the urging of the ONCE team, led by the French National Champion Laurent Jalabert. After the stage, the police due to a suspicion of organized doping also at other teams, decided to search their hotels and arrested rider Rodolfo Massi (Casino) and the two team managers Marc Madiot (Française des Jeux) and Vincent Lavenu (Casino). Massi was at this point of time nr.7 in the GC and wearing the mountain jersey, but had to leave the race due to the police finding illegal corticosteroids in his hotel room. He was also charged by the police for having sold EPO and other medicines to some riders in the peloton, as Voet had named him as one of his \"business relationships\", but this criminal charge was later dropped — due to no additional proof found by police. The Italian Olympic Committee subsequently only banned him six months for doping possession.\nAfter stage 17, all the six remaining TVM-riders in the race were escorted by the police to the nearest hospital, for submission of samples to an extra judicial ordered doping control. One day later, the TVM team decided also collectively to withdraw from the race, and thus became the final 7th team to withdraw.\nFestina riders tested by police.\nAccording to the doping test analysis result for the nine Festina riders, with samples withdrawn by police on 23 July 1998, the following doping substances had been detected:\nNot all of the nine Festina-riders immediately confessed. While the first seven riders all opted to admit using performance-enhancing drugs when confronted with their failed test results in November 1998, the last two riders Virenque and Herve continued to maintain their innocence, until they in October 2000 finally admitted during the final court proceedings. All riders with failed tests were punished with a half-year suspension, except Neil Stephens, who escaped a sanction by choosing to retire.\nTVM riders tested by police.\nIn the TVM investigation, the police did not limit the extra doping test for samples withdrawn 29 July of the six remaining TVM-riders in the race (Jeroen Blijlevens, Bart Voskamp, Servais Knaven, Steven de Jongh, Serguei Outschakov and Sergei Ivanov). On 20 August 1998 they also called in these seven riders for interrogation and submission of samples for additional doping control: Michel Lafis, Tristan Hoffman, Hendrik Van Dijck, Peter Van Petegem, Laurent Roux, Johan Capiot and Lars Michaelsen. As one of these riders, it was either Capiot or Michaelsen, refused to submit samples, the total number of tested TVM riders was 12. In May 2001, during the final court hearing in the TVM trial, the medical expert witnesses stated, that from this tested group the test results had proofed, that the following six were \"very likely\" to have injected the specified doping substances:\nAll of the six riders who failed drug tests, refused in court ever to have used doping. The court however found sufficient amount of evidence had been presented (104 EPO vials seized from a TVM-car in March 1998, syringes with EPO remainings found in dustbins located in TVM rented hotel rooms during the Tour de France, as well as other doping products seized from TVM's Tour bus), to conclude that organized doping at the TVM team was conducted in the preparation and during the 1998 Tour de France. Consequently, the court handed out suspended sentences from 6–18 months to the team's manager, sports director and soigneur. For unknown reasons, none of the six riders with failed tests had their cases evaluated by a sports court, and thus none of them ever received suspensions for their failed tests.\nLater confessions of the nine TVM-riders in the 1998 Tour de France:\nRetrospective EPO test.\nAt the time of the race there was no official test for EPO. In 2004, 60 remaining antidoping samples given by riders during the 1998 Tour, were tested retrospectively for recombinant EPO by using three recently developed detection methods. More precisely the laboratory compared the result of test method A: \"Autoradiography — visual inspection of light emitted from a strip displaying the isoelectric profile for EPO\" (published in the Nature journal as the first EPO detection method in June 2000), with the result of test method B: \"Percentage of basic isoforms — using an ultra-sensitive camera that by percentage quantify the light intensity emitted from each of the isoelectric bands\" (pioneered at the Olympics in September 2000, with values above 80% classified as failed, but the laboratory applying an 85% threshold for retrospective samples – to be absolutely certain that no false-positives (incorrectly failed tests) can occur when analyzing on samples stored for multiple years). For those samples with enough urine left, these results of test method A+B were finally also compared with the best and latest test method C: \"Statistical discriminant analysis — taking account all the band profiles by statistical distinguish calculations for each band\" (which feature both higher sensitivity and accuracy compared to test method B).\nThe results of test method A applied retrospectively in 2004, were published to have returned 44 positives (failed) and 9 negatives (not failed), while the last 7 samples did not return any readable results due to sample degradation. At first, the rider names with a positive sample were not made public, as it had only been conducted as scientific research.\nIn July 2013, the antidoping committee of the French Senate however decided it would benefit the current doping fight to shed full light on the past, and so decided — as part of their \"Commission of Inquiry into the effectiveness of the fight against doping\" report — to publish all sample IDs along with the result of the retrospective test. This publication revealed, that the 9 negative samples belonged to 5 riders, of which 2 have admitted to have used EPO before or during the 1998 Tour de France (George Hincapie and Stuart O'Grady), while the 44 positive samples belonged to 33 riders — including race winner Marco Pantani, runner-up Jan Ullrich, third on the podium Bobby Julich, and points-competition winner Erik Zabel.\nPrior of the published retrospective test, the following riders had already admitted using EPO in preparation/during the 1998 Tour:\nAfter the release of the retrospective test report, the following riders also admitted using EPO in preparation/during the 1998 Tour:\nWhen combining the EPO abuse confessions of the two riders testing negative with all the positive test results, it was indicated that 35 out of the 38 retrospectively tested riders (92%) had been using EPO in the 1998 Tour de France. A number, which came on top of the additional 9 out of 9 Festina riders and 2 out of 9 TVM riders, who already had confessed EPO abuse due to their implication in the prior police investigations.\nAdditional doping confessions.\nAmong the riders who were never tested for EPO abuse, the following nevertheless later on confessed also having doped with EPO in preparation/during the 1998 Tour de France:\nRiders in the top 10 of the final general classification, accused of doping.\nChris Boardman was the only rider to wear the yellow jersey in 1998 who has not been accused of doping. Of the top ten riders to finish the 1998 Tour, eight were later accused or convicted of doping:"

        "title": "2018 EuroLeague Final Four",
        "text": "The 2018 EuroLeague Final Four was the concluding EuroLeague Final Four tournament of the 2017–18 EuroLeague season, the 61st season of Europe's premier club basketball tournament, and the 18th season since it was organised by Euroleague Basketball. It was the 31st Final Four of the modern EuroLeague Final Four era (1988–present), and the 33rd time overall that the competition had concluded with a final four format. The Final Four was played at the Štark Arena in Belgrade, Serbia, on 18 and 20 May 2018.\nVenue.\nOn 26 October 2016 Euroleague Basketball announced that the Final Four would be held in the Štark Arena in Belgrade. It is designed as a universal hall for sports, cultural events and other programs. It was the first time the EuroLeague Final Four was hosted in Belgrade, or in the country of Serbia. The Arena's total floor area is 48,000 square metres. For sports, it has a regular seating capacity for fans of 18,386, and also has 70 luxury boxes, which include a total of 860 seats. The arena's cost was estimated at €70 million. Štark Arena is a member of the European Arenas Association (EAA).\nBackground.\nCSKA Moscow.\nCSKA Moscow finished the regular season as the number one seed, after having a 24–6 record. In the quarter-finals, the team played another Russian side in Khimki. CSKA won the series 3–1 over Khimki, after a controversial 88–89 win in Game 4. In the United League season, CSKA was in second place while battling for the first seed.\nFenerbahçe Doğuş.\nFenerbahçe finished second in the regular season and defeated Kirolbet Baskonia in the quarter-finals. Fenerbahçe reached the Final Four for a fourth straight year. Head coach Željko Obradović had the opportunity to win his tenth EuroLeague title, a record for most titles by a coach.\nReal Madrid.\nMadrid battled injuries during the regular season, as Sergio Llull, Ognjen Kuzmić and Rudy Fernández missed most of the games. As a five-seed, the team beat Panathinaikos in a controversial quarterfinal series, 1–3. The star player for Madrid during the season was Luka Dončić, who led the league in Performance Index Rating (PIR), and was later a top-three pick in the 2018 NBA draft. Dončić's games during the Final Four were televised in the United States, by NBA TV.\nIn the 2017–18 ACB season, Real Madrid was the number one seed.\nŽalgiris.\nIn the regular season, Žalgiris qualified as the sixth seed. Žalgiris won the series over favored Olympiacos, 3–1. For EuroLeague Legend Šarūnas Jasikevičius, this was his first visit to the Final Four as a head coach and also for the club since 1999. In its domestic LKL season, the club dominated as well, as it was in a secure first seed.\nSemifinals.\nSemifinal A.\nRussian champions CSKA Moscow returned to the Final Four to make it their seventh consecutive semi-final appearance. CSKA guard Sergio Rodríguez would play the semi-final against his former club, which he won the EuroLeague title with in 2015, as well as the EuroLeague MVP award in 2014.\nReal Madrid would play its fourth Final Four in five years. The match would be a re-match of the 2017 third-place game. During the regular season, both teams won their respective games at home, with this game being considered a Real Madrid home game.\nSemifinal B.\nDefending champions Fenerbahçe Doğuş returned to the Final Four to make it their third straight appearance. Led by head coach Željko Obradović, the all-time record holder for most EuroLeague championships won by a head coach, it defeated Kirolbet Baskonia 1–3 in the quarter-finals, to clinch a semi-final spot.\nŽalgiris Kaunas qualified for its first Final Four in 20 years, as the last time the team participated was in 1999, where it claimed the championship as well. The club beat Olympiacos 3–1 in the play-offs, despite not having home court advantage."

In 1989, the East Grinstead Cricket Club merged with nearby East Grinstead Hockey Club to create East Grinstead Sports Club Limited. Following the merger the club sold the cricket ground and moved to the site of the hockey club, which owned its own land. Money from the sale was spent on a new pavilion, a new cricket square and an artificial sand pitch (used for hockey). In 2017, the club won the Sussex Cricket League for the first time and reached the semi-finals of the National Club Championship, having beaten Bath in the quarter-finals.\nHonours.\n1st XI"

        "text": "Cricket must have reached Hertfordshire by the end of the 17th century. The earliest reference to cricket in the county is dated 1732 and is also the earliest reference to Essex as a county team. On Thursday, 6 July 1732, a team called Essex &amp; Hertfordshire played London Cricket Club in a first-class match at Epping Forest \"for £50 a side\". The result is unknown.\nHertfordshire has not usually been considered a first-class county but its teams did appear frequently throughout the eighteenth century and played in some matches classified as first-class. There was a county organisation of sorts in 1838 and the present Hertfordshire County Cricket Club was founded on 8 March 1876. It joined the Minor Counties Championship for the very first season, 1895, and is the only one of the seven competing sides from that season to have maintained membership continuously ever since."

He was the only boxing referee from the UK selected for the finals.

He also refereed the heavyweight 91 kg final at the Commonwealth Games, (Canada v New Zealand) in 2014, and the middleweight 75 kg final at the 2015 World Elite Men's finals in Doha, Qatar, (Cuba v Uzbekistan).\nCareer.\nMcFarlane served in the Royal Marine commandos from 1987 to 1990 and was awarded the GPMG medal, as well as becoming the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines Boxing Heavyweight champion. He became a military ski instructor and was three-times deployed within the Arctic Circle. He was the 45 Commando boxing coach 1989-90.\nHe joined Northumbria Police in 1992 and in 1993 was a member of the British Police boxing team taking part in the World Police and Fire Games in Colorado Springs, USA. He won a gold medal in this tournament and in 1994 won a silver medal in the World Police Boxing Championships in Denver.\nMcFarlane fought in 56 senior contests both at domestic and international level, retiring in 2001 at the age of 34. He remains a serving police officer.\nDanny summited Mont Blanc 4810 (French Alps) with his brother Shaun at 7am Wednesday 10 July 2018\nRefereeing.\nIn 2001, the same year he retired as a boxer, McFarlane became a referee/judge with the Tyne, Tees and Wear Amateur Boxing Association.\nIn 2007 he became a European qualified boxing referee/judge and in 2010 he was a referee/judge in the Kings' Cup Multi-Nation Boxing Tournament in Bangkok, Thailand.\nIn 2011 McFarlane attended the Ahmet Comet Boxing Tournament in Istanbul, Turkey and was awarded his Three Star, international AIBA referee/judge badge. The same year he was invited to referee in the Commonwealth Youth Games in Douglas, Isle of Man, beginning a long list of major tournaments covered.\nHe has covered 78 international events to date and remains an official with Tyne, Tees and Wear Amateur Boxing Association, still refereeing in local events from amateur youth boxing upwards.\nAs a Three-star judge, McFarlane also gives talks and workshops to trainee referees on the AIBA rules.\nPersonal.\nMcFarlane lives in Sunderland with wife Deborah and son Jacob."

He served as the second President of the IHF from 1950 to 1971.\nBiography.\nBorn in Basel, Baumann was an architect by profession. He became a member of the management committee of the Swiss Handball Association in 1939. He had previously served as the vice-president of the IHF from 1946 to 1950 along with Charles Petit-Montgobert (France) under the presidency of Gösta Björk (Sweden). Baumann was elected as IHF President in the 3rd IHF Congress held in Vienna on 9 September 1950, succeesding Björk. From then onwards, he was continuously elected unopposed as IHF President until his death. \nBaumann's main aim was to see handball return to the Olympic programme, which he achieved but was not able to witness himself—he died due to heart attack in Basel on 7 February 1971, a year and a half before the Olympic Handball Tournament in the Munich games.\nAfter his death and in recognition of his great contribution to the development of handball worldwide, the IHF Council and Royal Spanish Handball Federation together created an award named the Hans Baumann Trophy, which would be awarded biannually during IHF Congress to the member federations for their outstanding contribution to the development of handball in their country and throughout the world. In 2016, the award was re-established and renamed by IHF Council as the IHF President's Development Award."

        "title": "George Fant (American football)",
        "text": "George Fant (born July 19, 1992) is an American football offensive tackle for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He played college basketball and football at Western Kentucky, and was signed by the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent in 2016. Starting in 2018, Fant was used as a hybrid tight end on tackle-eligible plays for Seattle.\nEarly years.\nFant attended Warren Central High School where he lettered and started all four years in basketball. As a junior, he earned second-team All-State honors. As a senior, he recorded 62.2% from the field and led the team with 75 blocks, averaged 21.5 points per \ngame and 11.7 rebounds per game. For the season, he earned first-team All-State honors. When he graduated, he was the school's all-time leader in rebounds (1,039) and third in points (1,805). He was rated as a three-star recruit by Rivals.com and was listed on their Top 150 as the 150th best senior in the nation.\nCollege career.\nAfter high school, Fant attended Western Kentucky University, where he majored in recreation.\nBasketball career.\nAs a freshman in 2011–2012, he appeared in 31 games with 24 starts. He averaged 26.4 minutes per game. He averaged 10.4 points, 6.1 rebounds, and had a total of 37 blocks and 29 steals. He also led the team in field goal percentage (.476). His 321 points scored ranked seventh all-time for a freshman in school history. As a sophomore in 2012–2013 he averaged 12.8 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He shot 48.2% from the field going 163 for 338. After averaging 13.0 points and 7.5 rebounds per game he was named to the All-Sun Belt Conference tournament team. He was named All-Sun Belt third-team. In 2013–2014 as a junior, he averaged 13.3 points and 6.6 rebounds per game. He finished second on the team in scoring and led the team in rebounding for the second straight season. He finished seventh in the conference in rebounding. He led the team in field goal percentage with (.530), which was good for fifth in the conference. He was named to the All-Sun Belt third-team. As a senior in 2014–2015, he led the team in rebounding with 8.4 rebounds per game which was good for third in conference. He averaged 13.8 points per game, a career high. He recorded 12 double-doubles, second most in Conference USA. He was named All-Conference for the third consecutive season with second-team honors.\nFootball career.\nThroughout his first four years at Western Kentucky, friends and coaches urged Fant to join the Hilltopper football team but he refused. He received letters from multiple NFL teams in spring 2015 asking if he were interested in giving professional football a chance but disregarded the letters and threw them away. Fant decided to transition to football after weighing his options of either playing basketball overseas in Poland or attempting a football career. With a wife and child to care for, he chose to play football. Western Kentucky tight ends Tyler Higbee and Devin Scott helped him learn the tight end position and tight ends coach Ryan Wallace also worked with him. He bulked up from 250 lbs to 296 lbs for football. Fant also said that he studied many tapes of another basketball-to-football convert, tight end Jimmy Graham.\nFant used his fifth year of eligibility to join the Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team as a tight end. For the season, he appeared in two games, recording one reception for seven yards, as well as two tackles.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nFant was expected to go undrafted after playing only a single year of tight end at the collegiate football level. Due to his limited experience, Fant was not one of the 15 collegiate tight ends to attend the NFL Scouting Combine. On March 29, 2016, he attended Western Kentucky's pro day, along with Brandon Doughty, Tyler Higbee, Prince Charles Iworah, and 11 other prospects. Fant was listed as an offensive lineman during WKU's pro day and weighed 296 lbs, 26 lbs heavier than his playing weight of 270 lbs during the season. He impressed the Seahawks' co-director of player personnel Trent Kirchner with his athletic ability and worked out at multiple positions including linebacker, defensive end, defensive tackle, tight end, and offensive tackle. Although he did not have game film, he was able to impress enough with his athletic ability and size that the Seahawks signed him solely based on that single workout. Offensive line coach Tom Cable had to make the decision between Fant and another offensive line prospect but chose Fant because he was a \"long-armed athlete\".\nSeattle Seahawks.\n2016.\nFant signed with the Seattle Seahawks as an undrafted free agent on May 6, 2016.\nThroughout training camp he learned the offensive tackle position quickly and did well enough to win the backup left tackle job behind Bradley Sowell to begin the regular season. He made his professional regular-season debut on October 23, 2016, and played 24 snaps after Sowell sprained his knee during the 6–6 tie with the Arizona Cardinals. He made his first career start during Week 8 against the New Orleans Saints after Sowell was still unable to play due to injury. Fant committed two clipping penalties in his first two starts and also committed a false start.\nHe is the third player that Cable has successfully transitioned into an offensive lineman with little or no collegiate experience at the position. The Seahawks' starting right tackle, Garry Gilliam, was undrafted with only a single year of collegiate experience as a lineman and started in seven months. The first player was J. R. Sweezy, who had no experience, playing only defensive end in college. He transitioned to guard successfully in five months. Fant is the most dramatic change, earning the starting left tackle position in less than 20 months.\nOn November 13, 2016, he made his third career start against the New England Patriots and was credited with not committing a single assignment error in the Seahawks' 31–24 victory. He ultimately did well enough in his first four career starts that he remained the starter at left tackle once Sowell returned from his injury. He played the last ten consecutive games of the season as the Seattle Seahawks' starting left tackle and finished his rookie season appearing in 14 games with ten starts.\n2017.\nIn the second game of the 2017 preseason, Fant tore his ACL and was ruled out for the season. He was placed on injured reserve on September 2, 2017.\n2018.\nAfter rookie tight end Will Dissly got injured in a week 4 matchup with the Cardinals, Fant started to play an offensive tackle/tight end hybrid role. He would line up as a sixth offensive lineman, either on the line itself or outside, and declare himself an eligible receiver.

        "title": "Tom Allen (American football)",
        "text": "Thomas E. Allen (born March 14, 1970) is an American football coach who is the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Pennsylvania State University. He previously served as the head coach at Indiana University Bloomington from 2017 to 2023. He was named the 2020 Big Ten Coach of the Year and AFCA Coach of the Year. \nPrior to his tenure at Pennsylvania State University, Allen previously served as an assistant coach at Indiana University Bloomington, the University of South Florida, University of Mississippi (Ole Miss), Arkansas State University, Drake University, Lambuth University and Wabash College. A native of New Castle, Indiana, Allen also spent six seasons as defensive coordinator and three seasons as the head football coach at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis.\nEarly life and education.\nAllen played high school football at New Castle High School in New Castle, Indiana, where his father (also named Tom Allen) was the head football coach. While in high school, Allen also competed in shot put and wrestling. After high school, he attended Maranatha Baptist University, where he participated in football and wrestling.\nCoaching career.\nHigh school.\nFollowing their college graduation from Maranatha Baptist University, Allen and his wife moved to Florida, where both began teaching. Allen's first coaching job was with Temple Heights Christian School in Tampa, Florida, as defensive coordinator. Allen started in 1992; he took over as head coach during the 1993 season after the resignation of Steve Lewis, who remained the athletic director. In 1994, his only full season as Temple Heights head coach, Allen went 8–3 and lead his team to their first playoff appearance since 1976. Allen was a finalist for the Hillsborough County coach of the year award. The following year, Allen left to become defensive coordinator at Armwood High School in nearby Seffner, Florida.\nIn 1997, following two years at Armwood, Allen moved back to his native Indiana to become defensive coordinator at Marion High School in Marion, Indiana. Under Allen, Marion's allowed points-per-game dropped from 29 to 16.6. After just one year at Marion, Allen took the defensive coordinator job at Ben Davis High School in Indianapolis. The head coach at Ben Davis was Dick Dullaghan, whom Allen had come to know through the former's football camps in Lakeland, Florida. Dullaghan retired after the 2003 season and Allen succeeded him as head coach. Allen coached Ben Davis from 2004 to 2006. In those three seasons, his teams were 25–12 overall. Following the 2006 season, Allen moved up to the college coaching ranks, accepting an assistant coach job at Wabash College.\nWabash.\nAt Wabash in 2007, Allen coached defensive backs and special teams. Wabash competed in the North Coast Athletic Conference of NCAA Division III. Its head coach, Chris Creighton, was in the final year of a successful seven-year tenure. Following the 2007 season, Creighton left to become head coach at Drake University.\nLambuth.\nFrom 2008 through 2009, Allen joined the coaching staff of incoming head coach Hugh Freeze at Lambuth University in Jackson, Tennessee, as defensive coordinator. Freeze would be there for two years before leaving to become offensive coordinator at San Jose State University (and later Arkansas State University), departing after the 2009 season. Allen and defensive backs coach Ron Dickerson were internal candidates to succeed Freeze. Lambuth, which would shut down within a year, hired Dickerson, and Allen departed to become defensive coordinator at Drake. \nDrake.\nAt Drake in 2010, he was reunited with Creighton, now entering his third year there. Allen succeeded Neal Neathery, who had left to become defensive coordinator at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Allen left after the season to rejoin Hugh Freeze, who had been promoted to head coach at Arkansas State.\nArkansas State.\nIn 2011, Allen served as the assistant head coach at Arkansas State, his first position with a Division I FBS program. The head coach during this time was Hugh Freeze, who Allen had previously coached with at Lambuth University. After the end of the regular season, Allen followed Freeze to Ole Miss after Freeze was hired to be the head coach of the Rebels. In his sole season with the Red Wolves, they went 10–2. \nOle Miss.\nFrom 2012 to 2014, Allen spent three seasons as the linebackers coach and special teams coordinator at Ole Miss under head coach Hugh Freeze. During his time in Oxford, the Rebels went 24–15 and consistently ranked near the top of the FBS in terms of tackles for loss and sacks. Prior to his arrival, Ole Miss had ranked last in the SEC in total defense.\nSouth Florida.\nOn December 17, 2014, Allen was named defensive coordinator at South Florida under third-year head coach Willie Taggart. In his lone season in Tampa, Allen's defensive unit ranked first in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in scoring defense at just 19.6 points per conference game. His efforts also saw the team's defense rank high nationally, tying for 13th nationally in tackles for loss (7.5 per game), 14th in interceptions (17), 24th in takeaways (25), 26th in sacks (2.62 per game), 31st in rushing defense (141.4 ypg), 34th in passing efficiency defense (118.76), and 35th in scoring defense (22.9 ppg). Allen was considered a candidate for the defensive coordinator position at Auburn following then-defensive coordinator Will Muschamp's departure in December 2015, but the vacant position was ultimately filled by Kevin Steele.\nIndiana.\nAllen was hired on January 15, 2016, to serve as defensive coordinator on head coach Kevin Wilson's staff at Indiana. In replacing previous defensive coordinator Brian Knorr, Allen took over a defense that ranked #120 in the FBS in total defense and #106 in opponent points scored. After just one season, Allen engineered one of the top defensive turnarounds in the country with the team improving in every major statistical category against a schedule featuring four top-10 opponents, a program first. The Hoosiers were the most improved team nationally in total defense (-169.4 ypg) and passing defense (-134.1 ypg), the sixth-most improved in third-down defense (-12.2 percent) and the ninth-most improved in points per game allowed (-12.3 ypg).\nOn December 1, 2016, Indiana athletic director Fred Glass named Allen head coach after Wilson's sudden resignation, forcing Allen to make his coaching debut during the team's final game of the season at the 2016 Foster Farms Bowl. His contract guaranteed him $1.795 million annually — $500,000 per year in base pay, plus $1.295 million per year in outside, marketing, and promotional income. This made Allen the lowest-paid head coach in the Big Ten, although various bonuses could take his total compensation above $3 million.\nAllen quickly elevated Indiana's recruiting posture. During his first two seasons as head coach, a school-record number of players earned conference honors and a school record were drafted or invited to NFL camps. The 2019 signing class was the highest-rated in program history, besting his previous top-ranked class of 2018, and the two classes combined constituting 80 of the team's 115-man roster. In 2019, Allen's third season, he led Indiana to its first 7–2 start since 1993, the last season Indiana won eight games. That season Indiana earned a #24 ranking in the Associated Press and #25 ranking in the coaches poll, the team's first top 25 ranking in football since 1994. His 18 wins over his first three seasons were the most for an Indiana coach in the post-World War II era. Indiana finished the regular season with an 8–4 record, its first eight-win since 1993, and its 5-4 Big Ten record its first winning conference record since 1993. Following the regular season, Allen and the school agreed to a new seven-year contract with an average annual compensation of $3.9 million.\nIndiana's first game of the 2020 season took place at Memorial Stadium on October 24, 2020, against the #8 Penn State Nittany Lions. The Hoosiers defeated Penn State 36–35 in overtime. The Hoosiers were awarded a ranking of #17 following the victory. Indiana's next two games included a 37–21 victory over the Rutgers Scarlet Knights and a 38–21 victory over the #23 Michigan Wolverines, their first victory over them in 33 years. Following the win versus the Wolverines, the Hoosiers were ranked tenth in both the AP and coaches poll, their highest rankings since 1969 and 1992. Indiana finished the 2020 regular season 6-1 (shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic), ranked seventh in the AP poll, eighth in the coaches poll, and 11th in the CFP rankings and earned a bid in the Outback Bowl, where they lost to Ole Miss, 20–26. Following the culmination of the season, Allen would be named the 2020 Big Ten Coach of the Year, as well as the AFCA Coach of the Year.\nAllen's 2021 Indiana team was ranked 17th to begin the 2021 season, but hobbled by injuries, the team quickly fell out of the rankings after a 34–6 loss to Iowa in their first game of the season. The team finished the season 2–10 and went 0–9 in Big Ten play. Immediately following Indiana's last game of the season, offensive coordinator Nick Sheridan was fired and Allen took a $200,000 pay cut to help pay for the firing. Allen stated \"this season was not acceptable and we will work to address it.\"\nThe 2022 season began following a major off-season overhaul. More than 30 seniors and juniors had departed and the team added 13 players from the transfer portal, along with five new assistant coaches, two new coordinators, and Allen himself returning as the defensive play-caller for the first time since 2018. The 2022 recruiting class was the best of Allen’s tenure and \"arguably the best Indiana has signed in the era of class rankings.\" The Hoosiers, however, went 4–8, failing to qualify for a bowl game for the 2nd straight year under Allen.\nThe 2023 season began with low expectations for the Hoosiers. The offense switched to the option, which they had used towards the end of the 2022 season. The season began with a 23–3 loss at home to the #4 Ohio State Buckeyes. Indiana fired Allen after the conclusion of the 2023 season, in which the team posted a 3–9 record. Allen's overall record at Indiana was 33–49.\nPenn State.\nOn December 19, 2023, Allen was hired to be the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at Penn State University under head coach James Franklin, replacing Manny Diaz after his departure to become head coach at Duke University.\nPersonal life.\nAllen is a Christian and a supporter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.\nAllen is married to Tracy Allen. They have one son and two daughters together. His son Thomas attended Indiana University and played as a linebacker for Allen and the Hoosiers from 2018 to 2021."

It was held on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City. Experimental rules featured in qualifying for the main draw as well as in the junior, wheelchair and exhibition events.\nStan Wawrinka and Angelique Kerber were the previous year's men's and women's singles champions. Neither managed to defend their title as Wawrinka withdrew before the start of the tournament due to a knee injury that ended his season, while Kerber lost in the first round to Naomi Osaka.\nThe men's singles tournament concluded with Rafael Nadal defeating Kevin Anderson in the final, while the women's singles tournament concluded with Sloane Stephens defeating Madison Keys in the final.\nTournament.\nThe 2017 US Open was the 137th edition of the tournament and took place at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States. The tournament was held on 15 DecoTurf hard courts.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2017 ATP World Tour and the 2017 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There were also singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which were part of the Grade A category of tournaments. Additionally, there were singles and doubles wheelchair tennis events for men, women and quads.\nThe 2017 tournament saw the USTA try out two experimental rules. Firstly, the USTA introduced a shot clock to combat slow play and to address players going over the allotted time for warm ups and medical time outs. Secondly, coaching was allowed from the side of the court. Whilst a player was at the same end as their box they could verbally communicate, if they were at the opposite end then sign language would be allowed. This meant that coaching incidents involving Victoria Azarenka and Caroline Garcia at Wimbledon would have been allowed. The rules only applied in qualifying matches for the main draw, junior, wheelchair and legends matches.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place over a series of 15 courts with DecoTurf surface, including the two existing main showcourts – Arthur Ashe Stadium and the new Grandstand. Louis Armstrong Stadium, one of the main stadiums used in the previous tournament, was demolished after the 2016 tournament and was replaced for the 2017 edition by a temporary stadium located next to parking lot B near the construction of the previous Louis Armstrong Stadium site.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the 2017 US Open will be the third year in a row under an 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series. This means that the tournament is not available on broadcast television. This also makes ESPN the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for three of the four tennis majors. In Australia, SBS won the rights to broadcast the US Open with the free to air coverage starting from the quarter finals.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize-money compensation for the 2017 US Open is $50.4 million, a 3.7% increase on the same total last year. Of that total, a record $3.7 million goes to both the men's and women's singles champions, which is increased to 7.5 percent from last year. This made the US Open the most lucrative and highest paying tennis grand slam in the world, leapfrogging Wimbledon in total prize money fund. Prize money for the US Open qualifying tournament is also up 49.2 percent, to $2.9 million. The total prize money for the wheelchair tennis events was $200,000.\nDoubles seeds.\nMen's doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 21, 2017.\nWomen's doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 21, 2017.\nMixed doubles.\n1Rankings as of August 21, 2017.\nWild card entries.\nThe following players were given wildcards to the main draw based on internal selection and recent performances.\nExternal links.\n "

It was the 105th edition of the Australian Open, and the first Grand Slam tournament of the year. The tournament consisted of events for professional players in singles, doubles and mixed doubles play. Junior and wheelchair players competed in singles and doubles tournaments. As in previous years, the tournament's title sponsor was Kia.\nNovak Djokovic and Angelique Kerber were the defending champions and both were unsuccessful in their title defence; they lost to Denis Istomin and CoCo Vandeweghe in the second and fourth rounds, respectively. For the first time since the 2004 French Open, both No. 1 seeds lost before the quarterfinals, with both Andy Murray and Kerber defeated in the fourth round.\nRoger Federer won his eighteenth men's singles Grand Slam title by defeating Rafael Nadal in a five-set final. It was his first major title since 2012 Wimbledon and a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Nadal won in five sets. Serena Williams overcame her sister Venus in the women's singles final, surpassing Steffi Graf to become the player with the most major wins in the women's game in the Open Era. \nTournament.\nThe 2017 Australian Open was the 105th edition of the tournament and was held at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia.\nThe tournament was run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and is part of the 2017 ATP World Tour and the 2017 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of both men's and women's singles and doubles draw as well as a mixed doubles event. There were singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which are part of the Grade A category of tournaments, and also singles, doubles, and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the NEC tour under the Grand Slam category.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place over a series of 25 courts, including the three main show courts: Rod Laver Arena, Hisense Arena and Margaret Court Arena.\nBroadcast.\nIn Australia, selected key matches were broadcast live by the Seven Network. The majority of matches was shown on the network's primary channel Channel Seven; however, during news programming nationwide and most night matches in Perth, coverage shifted to either 7Two or 7mate. Additionally, every match was also available to be streamed live through a free 7Tennis mobile app.\nInternationally, Eurosport held the rights for Europe, broadcasting matches on Eurosport 1, Eurosport 2 and the Eurosport Player.\nEvents.\nMen's singles.\nThis was a rematch of the 2009 Australian Open final, which Rafael Nadal won to become the first (and to date, only) Spaniard to win the Australian Open title. The final saw the two holding service for six games of the first set, whilst during the seventh game was the pivotal break of serve giving Federer the opening set. Nadal quickly broke Federer's serve in the second set racing out to a lead that Federer could not overcome, giving him the second set and leveling the match at one set apiece. The third set was a rather lopsided affair seeing Nadal secure his service game only in the fourth game of the set. The fourth set started off competitively with the two holdings serve until Nadal broke in the fourth game of the set, a lead he would never surrender, evening the match at two sets apiece. The decisive fifth set commenced with a break of Federer's serve by Nadal, giving him a lead in the early going; however, Nadal's serve got broken during the sixth game of the set, leveling the match at two sets and three games apiece. Federer won the next three games breaking Nadal's service in the eighth game of the set to allow him to successfully serve out the match in the final ninth game. This was Roger Federer's 18th Grand Slam singles title, the most ever by a man in the history of tennis, and it was his fifth Australian Open title, just one shy of the record co-held by Novak Djokovic and Roy Emerson. Federer would go on to equal this record by defending his title successfully the next year.\nWomen's singles.\nThis was a rematch of the 2003 Australian Open final, where Serena Williams completed the first \"Serena Slam\" and her career Grand Slam, whilst Serena won five more Australian Open titles in the interim and her sister Venus had no other final appearances at the event. They each broke the others' serve twice to start the match with Venus finally holding serve in the fifth service game and her sister Serena holding her own serve in the subsequent game. The seventh game was the pivotal break of service that Serena Williams got on her sister Venus' serve, costing her the set just a mere three games later. During the second set, the two traded held service games for the first six games to start the set, whilst Venus started serving first. She would get broken again during the seventh game of the set, which eventually surrendered the match to sister Serena. This was Serena Williams' 23 Grand Slam singles title and seventh Australian Open title for her career, both being Open era records, whilst being one shy of Margaret Court's record of 24 in the history of tennis.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points offered for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe Australian Open total prize money for 2017 was increased by 14% to a tournament record A$50,000,000.\n1Qualifiers prize money was also the Round of 128 prize money.\nExternal links.\n "

Bayern had crossed in front of several horses at the break, causing serious bumping to occur. The stewards agreed that interference had occurred but did not feel that they could determine if this affected the result of the race.\nThe Classic was run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse of $5,000,000. It was run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nThere was a full field of fourteen for the Classic, led by four horses who were considered Horse of the Year contenders: Shared Belief, California Chrome, Tonalist and Bayern. Unusually, all four favorites were three-year-olds – the older horse division had been depleted by the retirement of horses such as Mucho Macho Man and Game On Dude.\nShared Belief was the pre-race favorite, coming into the race undefeated. He had missed the Triple Crown races in the spring due to injury, but recovered to beat older horses in both the Pacific Classic and Awesome Again.\nCalifornia Chrome was the second choice at 4-1 on the morning line, based on his dominant wins in the Santa Anita Derby, Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. However, California Chrome had injured himself when finishing fourth in the Belmont Stakes and finished sixth in his return in the Pennsylvania Derby.\nBayern, known for his front-running style, was one of the most difficult entries for the bettors to assess. He had several impressive wins during the year, including the Haskell Invitational and Pennsylvania Derby, beating California Chrome in the latter. However, he had also lost badly to California Chrome in the Preakness and V.E. Day in the Travers in races where he was challenged for the early lead. His \"one-dimensional\" style made him vulnerable, especially if longshot Moreno went to the lead with him as expected.\nThe other leading contenders were:\nRace description.\nBayern broke rapidly from the gate and \"took a hard left turn\" toward the rail, bumping Shared Belief in the process. Knocked off stride, Shared Belief in turn stumbled into Moreno, who had been expected to challenge Bayern for the early lead. Moreno lost his footing and never challenged. Bayern got good position on the rail and an uncontested lead while setting a fast pace.\nFor most of the race, Bayern was followed by Toast of New York, who had also bumped into both Shared Belief and Moreno while moving into position. California Chrome was not involved in the contact, racing on the outside a few lengths behind in third. He started to close as they entered the stretch but could not get by: Bayern won by a nose over Toast of New York with California Chrome a neck back. Shared Belief closed ground late to finish fourth. \nAfter a 10-minute inquiry, the stewards decided to let the results stand, explaining later that the rules in California made the decision subjective, requiring them to determine if the foul affected the result of the race. \"We all agreed there was interference, no question, Bayern broke in. Three or four horses suffered interference,\" said steward Scott Chaney. \"Did it change the outcome? Any interference could. At the start of a mile-and-a-quarter race we're really loathe to make a change. You really don't want us handicapping the race.\" Many still disagreed with the decision, especially given the impact on the expected pace scenario. Shared Belief's part-owner, Jim Rome said, \"The message is pretty much that you can commit a foul at the beginning of a race. But that can be extremely dangerous to horse and jockey.\" The controversy overshadowed the performances of the top finishers, who ran the -mile race in 1:59.88.\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.12; – 0:46.44; – 1:10.22; mile – 1:34.16; final – 1:59.98.\nFractional Splits: (:23.12) (:23.32) (:23.78) (:23.94) (:25.72)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "title": "West Indies B cricket team",
        "text": "West Indies B is a List A cricket team that participates in the West Indian domestic List A tournament and was formerly also a first-class cricket team that participated in the West Indian domestic First Class competition from the 2000–01 season to the 2003–04 season. It is selected by the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) from players who had been unable to secure a contract with one of the seven other existing regional teams, and is restricted to players under the age of 23 (with a few exceptions). West Indies B had little on-field success during its time in the competition (although a number of future internationals spent time in its squad), and the team was disbanded prior to the 2004–05 season after a wider reorganisation of domestic cricket in the region. It was reconstituted in June 2018 for participation in the inaugural Global T20 Canada competition with the intention of exposing and adding to the development of developing players who could become future international players. It subsequently participated in the 2018–19 Regional Super50 competition and in the 2019–20 Regional Super50 (where it was named as West Indies Emerging Team). The team has enjoyed more success in the List A format than it did in the First Class format, as it placed third in its group in the 2018-19 season (after suffering the most no results of any team in the group) and won the 2019-20 season.\nHistory.\nThe West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) introduced the West Indies B team for the 2000–01 Busta Cup. Mike Findlay, the WICB's chairman of selectors, said that the team was introduced to give \"young players the incentive to go on playing\", as a number of young players were quitting cricket after under-19 level because they could not secure a contract with one of the regional teams. Selection for West Indies B was restricted to players under the age of 23, but for the first two seasons the team was captained by an experienced older player (Richie Richardson in 2000–01 and Roland Holder in 2001–02).\nWest Indies B played a total of 28 matches across four seasons, winning just four matches during that time. In the 2000–01 Busta Cup, the team placed seventh out of eight teams, winning only against the Windward Islands (by 162 runs). West Indies B finished eighth the following season, again winning only once (defeating Bangladesh A by 59 runs). The team was winless in the 2002–03 Carib Beer Cup, but in the 2003–04 Carib Beer Cup won two matches to finish sixth overall. It had a higher turnover of players during its four seasons, with only nine players playing more than one season with the team.\nIn a reorganisation of West Indian cricket prior to the 2004–05 season, it was decided to disband West Indies B and return to the old format of six regional teams, which had last been used during the 1995–96 season. The extended competitions were said to have \"burdened a financially insecure organisation with heavy running costs\", while also diluting the standard of play.\nIt was reconstituted in June 2018 for participation in the inaugural Global T20 Canada competition where upon it won four and lost two of its six matches in the group stage to enter the playoff stage. It won its first playoff (against eventual champions Vancouver Knights) to enter the final which it lost to the same team. In total the team played 8 matches in the tournament, of which it won 5 and lost 3.\nIn the 2018–19 Regional Super50 competition the team played a total of 8 matches, winning 2 and losing 2 and experiencing 4 no results (the most of any team in its group), and placed third in the group and did not advance to the semi-finals. The team (as the West Indies Emerging Team) had a much better showing in the 2019–20 Regional Super50 season. It played 8 matches in the group stage, winning 4 and losing 3 and only experiencing 1 no result, placing second in the group and advancing to the semi-finals. The team beat Barbados in the first semi-final to advance to the final. They beat the Leeward Islands by 205 runs to win their first title in the competition.\nList of players.\nPlayers in bold played international cricket for the West Indies, either before or after playing for West Indies B. Players marked with an asterisk (*) played their only first-class cricket for West Indies B."

As of the 2020-2021 season the team plays in 2. deild karla.\nHistory.\nÁrmann was one of the founding teams of the first Icelandic basketball league in 1952. In 1968, its star player, Birgir Örn Birgis, won the inaugural Player of the Year award. In 1976, Ármann won its first national championship after beating KR 84-74 in the championship clinching game.\nOn 1 December 1979, Danny Shouse scored 100 points for Ármann in a 1 .deild karla game against Skallagrímur, setting the Icelandic single game scoring record. In January 1980 he scored 76 points in an overtime loss against Grindavík and in February he broke the 70 point barrier again, scoring 72 points against Þór Akureyri. In 10 games, he scored 648 points for an average of 64.8 points per game. His scoring prowess helped Ármann win Division I and achieve promotion to the Úrvalsdeild. Even though Shouse played in the nations tier 2 league during his first season, he was widely regarded as one of the best players in the country and finished third in the vote for Foreign Player of the Year.\nOn 6 April 2022, Ármann won the 2. deild karla, after winning all 21 league and playoff games, and was promoted to the 1. deild karla."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's coxed four",
        "text": "The men's coxed four competition at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place at Virgilio Uribe Rowing and Canoeing Course, Mexico City, Mexico. It was held from 13 to 19 October and was unexpectedly won by the team from New Zealand, which secured the country its first Olympic rowing gold medal. Thirteen teams (66 competitors, with the Soviet Union making one substitution) from 13 nations attended the competition. East Germany earned its first medal in its debut in the event, taking silver (the 1960 and 1964 Olympic tournaments had both been won by the United Team of Germany, with West German crews). Switzerland took bronze, its first medal in the men's coxed four since 1952.\nBackground.\nThis was the 13th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nAt the 1964 Summer Olympics, the men's coxed four event was won by the United Team of Germany. It was the last appearance of the German United Team. The 1962 World Rowing Championships had been won by the team from West Germany, and the 1966 World Rowing Championships had been won by East Germany. The West Germans had come second at the 1965 European Rowing Championships. The crew from the Soviet Union also belonged to the group of favourites, as they had won the last three European Rowing Championships and gained silver at the 1966 World Rowing Championships. A further medal contender was Italy, who had several previous Olympians in their boat. The New Zealand team had originally been selected as four rowers and a cox as a backup to the country's eight that had qualified. They started training together in Christchurch on the Avon River and gained the impression that they had the potential to win a medal as a coxed four. There were stern discussions with the New Zealand selectors but in the end, the rowers got their way and were put forward as a team of their own.\nMexico made its debut in the event; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. The United States made its 11th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe 1964 tournament introduced the \"B\" final, a consolation final that ranked rowers that had not qualified for the main, or \"A\", final. Races were held in up to six lanes. This rowing competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals), as well as a repechage round that allowed teams that did not win their quarterfinal heats to advance to the semifinals. Only one boat was eliminated in the first two rounds, with 12 of 13 advancing to the semifinals.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThree heats were rowed on 13 October; these were the first three rowing races of the 1968 Summer Olympics. Two of the heats had four teams and one had five teams, with the first three teams to qualify for the semi-finals, and the remaining teams progressing to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nOne heat was rowed in the repechage on 15 October. Of the four teams competing, the first three would progress to the semi-finals. The team from the host nation was eliminated in the repechage.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were rowed in the semi-finals on 17 October. Of the six teams competing per heat, the first three would qualify for the final, while the others would progress to the small final.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe team from the Soviet Union replaced one of their rowers in this heat, and swapped some seats. Arkady Kudinov rowed in this heat only.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe small final (now termed B final) was raced on 18 October.\nFinal A.\nThe final (now termed A final) was raced on 19 October. The New Zealand team unexpectedly beat the team from East Germany by over two seconds. In another surprise, the Swiss boat overtook the Italians for the bronze medal position. The win secured New Zealand its first Olympic rowing gold, and its third Olympic rowing medal in total. The Olympic competition was the first time that the team had raced together. The medals were presented by IOC vice-president Konstantin Adrianow."

        "text": "The European Golf Association (EGA) is a non-profit organisation based in Epalinges, Switzerland, which was founded in 1937 in Luxembourg.\nThe EGA's main activity consists of coordinating and co-organizing European amateur golf championships. It functions in coordination with its 49 member federations. It also is the body responsible for the implementation of the World Handicap System in Europe.\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022 the European Golf Association announced that it would not allow teams, individuals, and officials from Russia and Belarus to participate in EGA events in 2022, and that no EGA events were planned to take place in Russia or Belarus.\nHistory and function.\nThe European Golf Association was founded in Luxembourg on 20 November 1937.\nThe EGA is governed by three committees:\nIn addition to coordinating and co-organizing amateur golf tournaments and international matches, the EGA also reviews the European aspects of the Rules of Golf and the European amateur status as defined by The R&amp;A Rules Limited, being concerned only by matters of an international character.\nThe association is the governing body responsible for the implementation of the World Handicap System in Europe; it is particularly responsible for reviewing and harmonizing the calculation of handicap European amateur players.\nMember federations.\nThe EGA currently comprises 49 member federations. The EGA membership is reserved for national European golf associations, federations or unions, with only one representing the golf activities of its country. Each member federation operates independently in their respective country with regards to their domestic affairs over which the EGA has no jurisdiction.\nMember federations are divided into four geographical areas.\nWorld Handicap System.\nThe World Handicap System (WHS) is a new handicapping system implemented in 2020, which aims to unify the previous six different handicap systems in order to enable golfers to play and compete on a fair and equal basis, regardless of how and where they play. Until 2020, several different handicap systems were operating independently across different regions of the world, all of which were governed by separate bodies. Their different characteristics have sometimes resulted in inconsistency, as a player could have a different handicap depending which country he was registered in.\nThe WHS is governed by the World Handicap Authority, which features representatives of the six former handicapping bodies (the EGA, the United States Golf Association, the Council of National Golf Unions, Golf Australia, the South African Golf Association and the Argentina Golf Association), and is now jointly run by the United States Golf Association and The R&amp;A.\nThe EGA is the governing body responsible for the implementation of the World Handicap System in Europe, except the members representing England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, owing to their membership to the Council of National Golf Unions (CONGU). European golfers are affiliated to the national golf authority in charge in their jurisdiction.\nThe EGA member federations (excluding CONGU nations) are currently adopting and implementing the WHS in their respective countries. The implementation and oversight of handicapping continues to be the responsibility of each handicapping authority and National Association. Under one handicap system, a player’s handicap can be applicable on any course in the world. The WHS therefore facilitates international competition under one global system, granting players to compare their handicaps with and fairly compete against all registered golfers across the globe.\nEGA events.\nThe EGA coordinates and co-organizes 27 European golf tournaments.\nOthers.\nThe EGA is involved is involved in the organisation of the following events:\nNo longer disputed.\nFormer EGA championships has been discontinued:"

        "text": "Larry Robinson is an American former professional basketball player better known for his college career at the University of Texas at Austin between 1971 and 1974. Robinson was the first African-American to sign a National Letter of Intent to play basketball at Texas and is considered a pioneer of racial integration at the school, which at the time was mostly Caucasian and predominantly a football school. A native of Hobbs, New Mexico, he was unheralded for most of Hobbs High School career. Texas head coach Leon Black recruited him however, and Robinson enrolled in the fall of 1970.\nCollege career.\nDue to NCAA rules at the time, freshmen were not eligible to play varsity sports, so Robinson was forced to play on the Texas freshmen basketball team in 1970–71. In the three years that followed, Robinson etched his name into the Longhorns record book. As a sophomore, Robinson led Texas to a Southwest Conference championship and NCAA Tournament appearance, where they made it to the Sweet Sixteen. He was named to the all-conference first-team as well as being voted as the Southwest Conference Player of the Year. As a junior, Texas did not win the conference nor get a postseason invitation. In Robinson's final year (1973–74), he once again led the Longhorns to a conference championship and NCAA Tournament appearance, where they lost in the first round. He earned his second all-conference team and conference player of the year honors. Robinson finished his collegiate career with 1,377 points and 623 rebounds.\nProfessional career.\nHe was selected in the 1974 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets in the fourth round, 59th overall, but never played in the league. Robinson instead played in Europe and spent 10 years in Sweden where he was a star, at one point averaging over 35 points per game for a season. In his post-basketball life, Robinson spent a long time as an executive for Converse in Europe. He was inducted into the University of Texas Hall of Honor in 1989."

        "text": "The Next Generation ATP Finals (branded as the Next Gen ATP Finals) is an annual men's professional exhibition tennis tournament organized by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) for the best players of the season aged 20 years old or younger. The event debuted in 2017 at the PalaLido in Milan, where it was also staged for the next four editions, before it was moved to King Abdullah Sports City in Jeddah, beginning in 2023. From 2017 to 2023 the age threshold was 21 years and under.\nRanking points, prize money and other features.\nThe tournament does not distribute points for the ATP rankings for the participants. The ATP does not count it as an official ATP Tour tournament victory, but matches count towards official win–loss season record. Prize money worth US $2,275,000 is distributed and counts to the players' totals. From the beginning, the tournament regularly has incorporated new and experimental features that may or may not be introduced into other tennis events later on. It pioneered the implementation of electronic line-calling (so called 'Hawk-Eye Live' completely replacing human line-judges) back in 2017. Other experimental features include scoring systems different from recognized tennis matches, players communicating with their coaches via headphones, and so on.\nHistory.\nFollowing a competitive bid process, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) announced that the Italian Tennis Federation, in association with the Italian Olympic Committee, would organise a new ATP tournament featuring the world’s top 21-and-under singles players of the ATP Tour season. The first five editions of the Tournament were hosted in Milan, Italy from 2017 to 2022. Already in the first year, a special circumstance occurred. The 20-year-old Alexander Zverev played such a successful season that he was qualified at the same time for the Next Generation ATP Finals and for the ATP Finals of the best eight players from 2017. As the events were dated close and scheduled directly one after the other, the Hamburg native opted for the latter option.\nFor the 2024 season, the ATP announced an expansion of the Next Gen brand. In addition to lowering the age threshold from 21-and-under to 20-and-under, a Next Gen Accelerator Programme was introduced. This allows Next Gen labelled players who reach the top 350 of the ATP rankings up to 8 opportunities to enter the main draws of ATP Challenger Tour 125 and 100 events. Furthermore, those who reach the top 250 are provided a main draw entry for an ATP 250 event, along with two qualifying opportunities for them. \nFormat.\nPlayed over five days, the format for the competition consists of two round robin groups, followed by the semi-finals and final. Played on a singles-only court, the competition features the best seven qualified 20-and-under players of the season, plus one wild card.\nRules.\nA number of rule changes from the normal ATP format are used for the competition:\nQualification.\nThe Top 7 players in the \"Emirates ATP Race to Jeddah\" (formerly the \"Race to Milan\") will qualify. The eighth spot will be reserved for a wild card, the winner of a qualifying tournament. Eligible players must be 20-and-under as of the end of that calendar year.\nNext Gen ATP Finals appearances.\nWhen there are more than eight players listed for any year, it is usually due to withdrawal by one or more players because of injury. When a player withdraws early in the tournament, his place is filled by the next-highest qualifier. Participants are listed in order of number of appearances and best result. The 2020 edition was not played due to the COVID-19 pandemic."

        "text": "Orlando Claude Brown Jr. (born May 2, 1996) is an American football offensive tackle for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Oklahoma, and was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the third round of the 2018 NFL draft. Brown is the son of offensive tackle Orlando Brown, who also played for the Ravens.\nEarly years.\nBrown Jr. attended Peachtree Ridge High School in Suwanee, Georgia, where he played high school football. He was a three-star prospect. He received scholarship offers from Tennessee, Oklahoma, Alabama, Arkansas, and Auburn. Brown initially committed to Tennessee but changed his commitment to Oklahoma.\nCollege career.\nBrown redshirted his freshman year at Oklahoma in 2014. In 2015, he was named the starting left tackle. In his junior season, Brown made the 2017 College Football All-America Team and was one of three finalists for the Outland Trophy. Oklahoma finished the season 12-2 with a ranking of #3 in the nation, losing to Georgia in the College Football playoffs. On January 3, 2018, Brown announced he was forgoing his senior year and entering the 2018 NFL draft.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nOn January 3, 2018, Brown announced his decision to forgo his remaining eligibility and enter the 2018 NFL Draft. Brown attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis and performed all of the combine and positional drills, but had a poor performance. His 40-yard dash time was the slowest among any prospect at the combine and was described as a \"historically bad time\" by NFL analyst Mike Mayock. He also finished last in the bench press, vertical jump, and broad jump among all offensive linemen at the combine. The performance possibly hurt his draft stock after he was widely considered a first round pick among draft experts and scouts.\nHe fared poorly at the combine, putting up 14 reps on bench press, 5.85 40-yard dash (same as his father's Pro Day score), 82-inch broad jump, and a 19.5 vertical jump. He recovered at his Pro Day, achieving better results in all categories, including 18 reps on bench press, 5.63 40 yard dash, 89\" broad jump and 25.5\" vertical jump.\nAt Oklahoma's pro day he improved his 40-yard dash (5.68s), 20-yard dash (3.28s), 10-yard dash (1.88s), bench press (18), vertical jump (25 1/2\"), and broad jump (7'5\"). Brown attended visits and private workouts with multiple teams, including the Jacksonville Jaguars, Baltimore Ravens, Philadelphia Eagles, and Detroit Lions. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Brown was projected to be a second or third round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked as the fourth best offensive tackle in the draft by Sports Illustrated, was ranked the sixth best offensive tackle DraftScout.com and Scouts Inc., and was ranked the eighth best offensive tackle by NFL analyst Mike Mayock.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nThe Baltimore Ravens selected Brown in the third round (83rd overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. Brown was the ninth offensive tackle drafted in 2018 and was considered by analysts to be one of the biggest steals in the draft.\nOn May 16, 2018, the Ravens signed Brown to a four-year, $3.49 million contract that included a signing bonus of $865,720. In his rookie season, he appeared in all 16 games and started 10 games at right tackle. He started in the Wild Card loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.\nOn January 15, 2020, Brown, who had been named as an alternate at offensive tackle to the 2020 Pro Bowl, was added to the active Pro Bowl roster, replacing injured Oakland Raider Trent Brown. Brown was named to his second Pro Bowl in 2020.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn April 23, 2021, Brown was traded to the Kansas City Chiefs, along with a second-round pick (58th overall) in the 2021 NFL draft and a sixth-round pick in the 2022 NFL draft, in exchange for the Chiefs' first-round pick (31st overall) in the 2021 NFL Draft, a third-round pick (94th overall), a fourth-round pick (136th overall) and a 2022 fifth-round selection. Brown was named to the Pro Bowl on his first season with the team.\nThe Chiefs placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Brown on March 7, 2022. After failing to reach a long-term contract, he signed his franchise tag tender on August 2, 2022. The tender was worth $16.7 million. Brown helped the Chiefs win Super Bowl LVII against the Eagles 38-35 to give Brown his first Super Bowl victory.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn March 17, 2023, Brown signed a four-year, $64 million contract with the Cincinnati Bengals."

        "title": "Bill Jones (basketball, born 1958)",
        "text": "William Lawrence Jones (born September 26, 1958) is an American former professional basketball player. He played the majority of his professional career in Australia's National Basketball League (NBL) from 1985 until 1992.\nEarly life.\nBill Jones, a 6'9\" (207 cm) centre, was born and raised in Joliet, Illinois and attended Joliet Central High School where he was named to the All-Conference team and received an All-State honorable mention. After graduating in 1976, Jones attended the University of Northern Iowa from 1977 to 1981.\nProfessional career.\nIn 1985, Jones was signed by the Adelaide 36ers in Australia's National Basketball League where he played as an import player (from 1979 to 2015, NBL teams, with the exception of the New Zealand Breakers, were restricted to no more than 2 non-Australian players at a time). Quickly becoming the starting centre for the team (and easily its tallest player), Jones formed part of the league's best front court with former St. Augustine's Falcons Power forward, 6'7\" (201 cm) Mark Davis. Along with other stars including guards Al Green (a naturalised Australian born in The Bronx) and Darryl Pearce, 1980 Australian Olympics representative Peter Ali (the team captain), and the NBL's 1985 Rookie of the Year Mike McKay, the Ken Cole coached team made it through to the single game NBL Grand Final that year, but went down 121–95 to the Brisbane Bullets. During the year Jones averaged 13.3 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.6 blocks in 28 games.\nFor 1986, Ken Cole made Jones the captain of the 36ers. In 1985 Jones had fouled out in a number of games and Cole's motivation behind making him the captain was that hopefully he would cut the cheap fouls out of his game. The ploy worked and Jones went on to have his best season in Australia, averaging 19.1 points, 13.4 rebounds and 2.2 blocks per game over 30 games, shooting an NBL career high 31 points in the final regular season game against the Melbourne Tigers. The 36ers themselves enjoyed a golden year with the team going through the season with a 24–2 record, including going 13–0 on their home court, the 3,000 seat Apollo Stadium, earning them the nickname \"The Invincibles\". The two losses for the 36ers literally came from last second shots meaning that they were only seconds away from a perfect season, while against Geelong late in the season Jones saved Adelaide from a home loss when in the last second of the game he tip-dunked a missed 3 point attempt from Darryl Pearce to give Adelaide a 120–119 win. Going into the playoffs, the 36ers were overwhelming favourites to win their maiden championship having finished 5 games clear of the second placed Canberra Cannons. The team easily overcame the Illawarra Hawks 116–92 in their single game home Semi-final before again facing the Brisbane Bullets (who had come from behind to beat Canberra in their semi-final clash) in the now best of 3 game Grand Final series.\nIn the opening game at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in front of a then record indoor sports attendance in Australia of 11,000 fans, Jones led from the front for the 36ers with 30 points, 17 rebounds and 3 blocks as the 36ers won 122–119 in overtime (eventual series MVP Mark Davis had 38 pts, 23 boards and 5 assists). In a pivotal moment late in regulation time, Jones had pulled off the play of the game for his team when he stepped in front of Bullet's kingpin Leroy Loggins (the 1986 league MVP) and took a charge for what was Loggins' 5th foul (in the NBL at the time players were only allowed 5 fouls). A week later back in Adelaide where the 36ers had been the first team to go through a regular season undefeated at home, the 36ers were expected to wrap up the series, but were stunned by the Bullets who refused to go quietly and pulled off a 104–89 win. Jones and the 36ers would not be denied though, winning Game 3 and the series 113–91 at home. Over the series, Jones averaged 19.6 points, 15.6 rebounds and 3 blocks per game.\nDuring his time with the 36ers (which at the time was a semi-professional league with most players still having day jobs), Jones and Mark Davis worked as security at the Adelaide Casino, with Davis later joking that because of their height, their uniforms were too short making them look like Urkel, but that they had very little trouble from casino patrons as they \"towered over everybody back then\". While in Adelaide, Jones also formed a close bond with the 'Brothers' (as they called themselves) in the 36ers squad. The Brothers being African-American players Jones, Davis and naturalised Australian's Al Green and Dwayne Nelson.\nWith Ken Cole having been controversially sacked at the end of 1986, Adelaide had a new coach in Gary Fox. Although the team (which was largely intact from 1986) still finished 2nd on the ladder and were still the title favourites in 1987. However, they were upset 2–1 in their semi-final series against the Perth Wildcats and failed to make their 3rd straight Grand Final. 1988 would be more of the same for the 36ers, but Jones wouldn't be the team captain as Fox had taken that from him and given it to Darryl Pearce and Peter Ali. They again finished on top of the ladder at the end of the regular season but again faltered in the semi-finals, this time being swept by the eventual champion Canberra Cannons.\n1988 had seen the emergence of 6'10\" (208 cm) centre Mark Bradtke with the 36ers and at the end of the season coach Fox told the then 30 year old Jones that he would not be required in 1989. Jones then linked with former coach Ken Cole at the Newcastle Falcons for the year, playing 24 games for the club.\nWhen Cole left the Falcons at the end of 1989, Jones left as well and played for two years in Central and South America before returning to Australia in 1992 where he played 2 games for the Geelong Supercats in the NBL as well as playing for the Bayside Blues in Melbourne as well as the Gippsland Lakers before retiring from playing in 1994.\nBill Jones played 139 NBL games from 1985 to 1992, averaging 16.0 points, 11.5 rebounds and 2.0 blocked shots per game. Although at only 6'9\" he wasn't the tallest centre (many centre opponents in the NBL were around 1-3 inches taller), Jones' jumping ability and 7'0\" (213 cm) wingspan made him a noted shot blocker.\nCurrent.\nBill Jones currently lives in Melbourne, Australia where he is the Project Manager for Australian Unity. Since his retirement from basketball, Jones has also taken up Roller hockey and he counts the 1986 NBL Championship win with the Adelaide 36ers as his career highlight."

        "text": "The 2016 FIA GT World Cup (officially the SJM Macau GT Cup – FIA GT World Cup) was a Grand Touring (GT) sports car race held on the streets of the autonomous territory of Macau on 20 November 2016. It was the event's second annual edition, and the ninth time GT3-specified machinery had participated in Macau. Unlike the 2015 race, it was not run as a non-championship GT Asia Series race. The Automobile General Association Macau-China appointed motorsports organiser Stéphane Ratel Organisation (SRO) to help form a grid. The race itself consisted of two races: a twelve-lap qualification race that determined the starting grid for the four-lap main race.\nLaurens Vanthoor of Audi Sport Team WRT won the main race in a R8 LMS from pole position after winning the event's Qualification Race the day before. Vanthoor passed his teammate Edoardo Mortara on the rolling start and went on to win the qualifying race. Vanthoor led the first four laps of the main race before being passed by Earl Bamber in a Manthey Racing-entered Porsche 911 GT3 R at the start of lap five. After hitting a barrier, Vanthoor went airborne and landed on the roof of his car, thereby ending the race. Vanthoor was named the winner after the results were counted back to the conclusion of lap four. Manthey Racing's Kévin Estre finished second, and Mercedes-AMG Driving Academy's Maro Engel completed the podium in third.\nBackground and entry list.\nAt an FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting on 4 March 2016, the 2016 FIA GT World Cup was confirmed, and the FIA immediately opened the tender for the race's official tyre and fuel providers. It was the event's second running and the ninth annual Grand Touring car race in Macau. The FIA GT World Cup was held at the 22-turn Guia Circuit on 20 November, following three days of practice and qualifying. For the 2016 event, the FIA changed the regulations for how manufacturers could win the FIA GT World Cup for Manufacturers Championship. The 2015 race's points system was abandoned in favour of awarding the prize to the top overall manufacturer at the end of the main race. Stéphane Ratel, the founder of the motorsports organisation Stéphane Ratel Organisation, said that the changes were made to simplify the race, \"It doesn't make sense to have points for a one-off event. The manufacturer that wins gets both titles.\" Pirelli was the race's official tyre supplier.\nTo compete in the FIA GT World Cup in Macau, drivers had to have competed in a Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)-regulated championship race based on GT3 regulations in the preceding two seasons or have extensive experience in Grand Touring cars. Manufacturers could enter up to two drivers and were limited to platinum-rated drivers; gold-rated entrants could only race with privateers. Bronze and silver-rated entrants were considered on a case-by-case basis by the FIA GT World Cup Committee. The race's entry list was released on 6 October. The final entry list included 23 drivers from the Blancpain Endurance Series, the FIA World Endurance Championship, the GT Asia Series, the Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters (DTM), the Super GT and the Porsche Carrera Cup. Drivers such as the 2015 winner Maro Engel, 2015 24 Hours of Le Mans co-winner Earl Bamber, DTM driver Edoardo Mortara, 2000 Macau Grand Prix victor André Couto and 2013 FIA GT Series champion Laurens Vanthoor raced.\nPractice and qualifying.\nThere was one half an hour practice session each on Thursday afternoon and Friday morning preceding Sunday's race. In the first practice session, Bamber lapped the No. 911 Manthey Racing Porsche 911 GT3 R in 2 minutes, 19.253 seconds, more than two-tenths of a second faster than anyone else. Mortara's No. 7 Audi Sport Team WRT R8 LMS was second, and Vanthoor in the sister No. 8 vehicle was third. Fourth was Kévin Estre's No. 912 Manthey Porsche, and fifth was Richard Lyons' No. 991 Craft-Bamboo Racing car, the highest-placed privateer. Rounding out the top ten were Engel, Darryl O'Young, Nico Müller, Renger van der Zande and Adderly Fong. When Fong made an error and crashed his Bentley Continental GT at Police Bend, the session was red flagged. His car was craned off the track because it caused a multi-car traffic jam. Engel's No. 1 Mercedes-AMG Driving Academy car set a new GT3 circuit lap record of 2 minutes, 17.153 seconds in the final five minutes of the second practise session. Mortara was a second slower in second, followed by Bamber and Vanthoor. Estre was fifth, with Müller the highest-ranked privateer in sixth. Cheng Congfu, Van der Zande, Fong and Nick Catsburg completed the top ten. On 20 minutes, Lyons was caught off guard by his car's anti-lock braking system and damaged the front-right suspension against the barrier on the hill between Paiol and Police corners, stopping the session and necessitating a rebuild for qualifying.\nFriday afternoon's half-hour qualifying session set the starting order for the qualification race using each driver's fastest laps. Vanthoor took the lead after everyone completed their first timed laps before two stoppages limited driving.  Pasin Lathouras lost control of the No. 50 Spirit of Race Ferrari 488 GT3's rear driving through Mandarin Oriental Bend, colliding with the outside barrier and stopping on the circuit. Lyons raced over the inside kerbs as he approached the same corner, spinning his car violently into the wall twice. In his final race as an Audi works driver, Mortara set a new GT3 track record and took pole position with a time of 2 minutes, 16.862 seconds on new tyres. Vanthoor joined him on the grid's front row, and Bamber was the best-placed Porsche driver in third. Fourth-placed Engel knocked his car's rear out of alignment after glancing the barriers. Müller, Estre, Van der Zande, Catsburg, Fong, Cheng completed the top ten. Fabian Plentz was the fastest driver not to qualify in the top ten, starting ahead of Mirko Bortolotti in the faster of FFF Racing's two Lamborghini Huracán GT3s. The Ferraris of Hiroki Yoshimoto and Lathouras were 13th and 15th; Marchy Lee separated them in 14th. Couto led Lyons, Ricky Capo, Philip Ma, Kuo Hsin Kuo, John Shen and Tommy Tulpe as the last drivers to set a lap time. O'Young did not set a qualifying lap because his crew was unable to repair his car after an accident during the second practice session that destroyed the top mounting and cracked the chassis.\nQualifying Race.\nThe qualifying race to set the grid order for the main race egan in cloudy and dry weather at 12:10 Macau Standard Time () on 19 November. Lyons' car was withdrawn by Craft-Bamboo Racing because it could not be repaired in time for the event due to substantial damage to the roll cage caused by his crash in qualifying. Vanthoor accelerated quicker than his teammate Mortara as the race began, passing him into Reservoir Bend. Mortara then lost control of his vehicle and slammed into the corner's left-side wall. To try to avoid colliding with him, the remainder of the field crowded in, and he damaged his car's spoiler and rear panel. Meanwhile, Vanthoor prevented Bamber and his teammate Estre from passing him, with the Mercedes duo of Engel and Van der Zande behind them. On lap two, Müller (who spun from contact with Van der Zande at Lisboa corner and hit a barrier) lost control of his vehicle leaving Mandarin Oriental Bend and struck a wall heavily, necessitating the safety car's deployment. Mortara made two pit stops during the safety car period to remedy aerodynamic deficiencies from his fractured rear wing, repair damage to his back panel, and have new tyres installed on his car. He fell to 13th because the safety car neutralised much of the potential time lost due to the lengthy time required extricating Müller's car because of the small track and the lack of speedy recovery..\nVanthoor led as racing resumed at the start of lap five. The action was cut short after Ma and Chen collided and crashed at Reservoir Bend. The safety car was withdrawn on lap nine. Bamber applied significant pressure to Vanthoor and slipstreamed him into Mandarin Oriental Bend corner. Bamber then lost momentum through the following turn and gave Vanthoor a small advantage that grew progressivelly. Vanthoor maintained his lead through the circuit's mountain portion. Mortara returned to the lead lap before a mistimed overtake on the final lap put O'Young into the Maternity Bend wall. Vanthoor was the first to finish after 12 laps, earning pole position for the main race. Bamber finished second on the road, 0.786 seconds behind his teammate Estre. Engel finished fourth with teammate Van der Zande fifth. Fong, Catsburg, Plentz, Yoshimoto and Bortolotti rounded out the top ten finishers. The final classified finishers were Cheng, Lee, Mortara, Couto, Lathouras, Capo, Kuo, Ma, Tulpe and O'Young. The two safety cars made the race untidy for all participants, therefore seven of the twelve racing laps were conducted under green flag conditions.\nMain Race.\nThe main race commenced in cloudy and dry weather at 12:55 local time on 20 November. The stewards led by Tim Mayer, the Automobile Competition Committee for the United States' chair, imposed three-place grid penalties on Van der Zande and Mortara for their respective collisions with Müller and O'Young in the previous day's qualification race. Müller and O'Young were withdrawn from the race due to heavy structural damage to their cars that could not be fixed in Macau. Vanthoor maintained the lead as he approached Mandarin Oriental Bend, while Bamber held off a challenge from teammate Estre for second. Bamber's block on Estre caused Engel to collide with a barrier at Reservoir Bend turn, resulting in a five-second time penalty. Engel recovered from the contact and passed Fong into the Lisboa corner to reclaim fourth position. At the conclusion of the first lap, Vanthoor led Bamber, Estre, Engel, Fong and Van der Zande who gained two positions from the start to run in sixth.\nThe race initially went under the safety car due to a crash for Capo exiting Fisherman's Bend on his first lap, as his BMW Z4 GT3 clattered the tyre barrier at considerable speed midway through lap two, necessitating repairs. The race was stopped the conclusion of lap three for of an hour, which designated the race official under the FIA Code. Every driver had to enter the pit lane after driving behind the safety car. A marshal was hurt while repairing the barrier and recovering Capo's car, and an ambulance was dispatched to the scene. The official timing clock continued to run during the stoppage, and 18 minutes remained when all cars returned to the circuit. The event restarted behind the safety car on lap five. With 15 minutes to go, the safety car was withdrawn and racing resumed. Bamber used his vehicle's superior torque to pass Vanthoor for the lead into Mandarin Oriental Bend and build up a wide enough margin to neutralise the penalty's effect after being told of his five-second time penalty for his collision with Engel at the initial start.\nVanthoor followed Bamber closely, hoping to slipstream him down to the braking zone for Lisboa corner. Consequently, Vanthoor was caught in an aerodynamic push, misread the entry to the next corner, and slipped wide by going over the inside kerbs. He was sent heavily into the lower catchfence on the outside exit barrier at , removing his car's rear wing. Then the floor of Vanthoor's car caught air at its front, lifted airborne and overturned onto its roof. His car's bay caught fire while sliding on its roof for more than into Lisboa corner. Vanthoor was slowed by the friction of the roof before stopping as other drivers swerved to avoid hitting him. He was unhurt and exited the car unaided.\nThe race was stopped for the second time and did not resume because there were only four minutes remaining and clearing the debris left by the accident would have been time-consuming. Race officials decided to take the results from the running order at the end of the fourth lap. Although regulations stated a driver who caused a red flag would face sanctions such as disqualification, the stewards took no action. Vanthoor thus took his first victory in Macau, and Audi won the FIA GT World Cup Manufacturers' Trophy. Estre was 3 seconds behind in second and Engel completed the podium in third. Bamber's five-second time penalty dropped him from second to fourth. Fong, Van der Zande, Catsburg, Plentz, Bortolotti, Cheng, Yoshimoto, Couto, Mortara, Lathouras, Kuo, Ma, Shen, Tulpe and Lee were the final classified finishers. Vanthoor led for four laps, more than any other driver, in less than two laps at race pace.\nPost-race.\nThe FIA responded to Vanthoor's accident and the Macau scheduling restrictions by moving the opening race of the 2017 Guia Race of Macau from Sunday morning to Saturday afternoon to accommodate for the increased potential that the 2017 race would last 18 laps. As part of the race organizer's goal to avoid repeated crashes, only manufacturer-supported teams with professional drivers rated platinum or bronze were allowed to compete, and safety and trackside recovery procedures were improved."

        "title": "2015 Breeders' Cup Classic",
        "text": "The 2015 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 32nd running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2015 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on October 31, 2015, at Keeneland in Lexington, Kentucky.\nTriple-crown winner American Pharoah was heavily favored for the race and won in a wire-to-wire performance. In doing so, he became the first horse to complete the Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing, consisting of America's four most prestigious races: the Kentucky Derby, Preakness Stakes, Belmont Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic.\nThe Classic was run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse of $5,000,000. It was run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nAmerican Pharoah (program #4) was made the 6-5 morning line favorite based on his wins in the Triple Crown and Haskell Invitational. However, he lost the Travers Stakes in late August, after which his owner Ahmed Zayat had contemplated retiring the horse. \"My gut's saying if the horse showed me he's tailed off, that he's not the Pharoah I know, then there's no question in my mind that the right thing is to retire him,\" said Zayat shortly after the race. \"He doesn't owe me or anybody anything.\"\nA few days later, Zayat had reconsidered and announced that American Pharoah would race once more. \"The champ deserves another chance. He won the Triple Crown and deserves to be in the sport's premier year-end event.\" American Pharoah came into the Classic off a two-month layoff and was also facing older horses for the first time.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic was first run in 1984, whereas the last Triple Crown winner before American Pharoah was Affirmed in 1978. Therefore, 2015 was the first opportunity for a horse to complete what journalists dubbed the \"Grand Slam\": winning the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, Belmont and Breeders' Cup Classic in the same year.\nBeholder (#10) was second choice on the morning line at 3–1, having won six straight races including an impressive win against males in the Pacific Classic. As Beholder had a similar running style to American Pharoah, she had been expected to press the pace. However, Beholder developed an illness a few days before the Classic and had to be scratched.\nLiam's Map, winner of the Woodward Stakes, would have been a strong contender in the Classic but his connections elected to run in the Breeders' Cup Dirt Mile instead.\nThe remaining rivals for American Pharoah were:\nSmooth Roller (#7) was a late scratch due to a tendon injury.\nRace description.\nWithout Liam's Map, Smooth Roller and Beholder in the race, American Pharoah was expected to be able to get an unchallenged lead, which would allow him to set a comfortable pace and make it harder for others to close ground. Accordingly, his odds shortened from 6–5 on the morning line to 3–5 at post-time. Honor Code became the second favorite and was expected to make a strong late run, but a slow pace would make his task more difficult.\nThe race played out much as expected. American Pharoah broke well and took command, demonstrating a high cruising speed that kept him in the lead while conserving energy. Only Effinex stayed close, with the two running one-two for the entire race. American Pharoah pulled away in Keeneland's long stretch to win by over six lengths while setting a track record. Honor Code made his expected late run but finished well back in third.\nAfter the race, Zayat commented: \"I said it once and more than once that this race was only about American Pharoah – we wanted him to go out as a winner just for the horse. He had run so hard and brilliantly for such a long time. I doubt we will ever see a horse who is able to take what he has done in terms of shipping in and out and going to seven or eight different tracks. He doesn't care about the surface or where he is sitting, he just does it all.\"\n\"He gave everyone what they came to see today,\" said his trainer Bob Baffert. \"I've never seen anything like him; I've never trained anything like him. I'm just glad Pharoah goes out the champ he is.\"\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.99; – 0:47.50; – 1:11.21; mile – 1:35.47; final – 2:00.07.\nFractional Splits: (:23.99) (:23.51) (:23.71) (:24.26) (:24.60)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "text": "The 2017 Survivor Series was the 31st annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on November 19, 2017, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. After the 2016 event had several interpromotional matches between the two brands, the theme of the 2017 event became brand supremacy, and every match of the main card involved wrestlers of the Raw brand facing wrestlers of the SmackDown brand.\nTen matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. The card was highlighted by two traditional Survivor Series elimination matches: Team Raw's men defeated Team SmackDown's in the main event, and Team Raw's women also defeated Team SmackDown's. The champions of each brand faced their counterparts in non-title matches; except for SmackDown's WWE Champion AJ Styles, who lost to Raw's Universal Champion Brock Lesnar, all SmackDown champions were victorious. Also on the main card, Raw's The Shield (Roman Reigns, Seth Rollins, and Dean Ambrose) defeated SmackDown's The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods), which was also The Shield's first match together since Payback in June 2014. Raw won brand supremacy by winning four of the seven matches on the main card. On the pre-show, which consisted of non-interbrand matches, Enzo Amore defeated Kalisto to retain Raw's WWE Cruiserweight Championship in what was the only title match of the night.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual professional wrestling event produced every November by WWE since 1987, generally held the week of Thanksgiving. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand extension, again splitting the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. Subsequently, the 2016 event featured several interpromotional matches to determine which was the better brand, similar to the previous Bragging Rights pay-per-view. This was the genesis for the theme of Survivor Series 2017, which was brand supremacy. Announced on November 17, 2016, the 31st Survivor Series was scheduled to be held November 19, 2017, at the Toyota Center in Houston, Texas. In addition to airing on traditional pay-per-view worldwide, the event was livestreamed on the WWE Network. Travel packages became available on December 6 while individual tickets went on sale on December 9.\nAs part of the brand supremacy theme, the 2017 event had traditional Survivor Series matches between the two brands. It also featured every champion of the Raw brand facing their counterpart of the SmackDown brand in non-title matches: Raw's Universal Champion against SmackDown's WWE Champion, the Raw Women's Champion against the SmackDown Women's Champion, Raw's Intercontinental Champion against SmackDown's United States Champion, and the Raw Tag Team Champions against the SmackDown Tag Team Champions. As the Raw brand's WWE Cruiserweight Championship was the only title of its kind in WWE, it was the only title to be defended, which occurred on the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 10 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nAt Raw's pay-per-view No Mercy, Brock Lesnar defeated Braun Strowman to retain the Universal Championship, while at SmackDown's Hell in a Cell pay-per-view, Jinder Mahal retained the WWE Championship against Shinsuke Nakamura. On the October 17 episode of \"SmackDown\", Mahal said that he had defeated every worthy opponent on the SmackDown roster and that at Survivor Series, he wanted to face Raw's top champion, Brock Lesnar; this challenge was made prior to the official announcement that all of Raw's champions would face their SmackDown counterparts. AJ Styles took exception to Mahal's claim and challenged Mahal for the WWE Championship. Mahal said that Styles was a joke, and Styles attacked Mahal and The Singh Brothers (Samir Singh and Sunil Singh). Backstage, Mahal confronted SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan about the incident, and said that one of The Singh Brothers should make Styles pay and Bryan agreed; Styles defeated both Sunil and Samir, respectively, on the following two episodes. On the October 23 episode of \"Raw\", Lesnar and his advocate Paul Heyman laughed at Mahal's challenge but accepted nevertheless. On the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown\", Styles defeated Mahal to win the WWE Championship, thus replacing Mahal as Lesnar's opponent at Survivor Series. Lesnar and Heyman appeared on \"Raw\" the following week to address Lesnar's new opponent, stating that Styles was the ultimate underdog, but that Lesnar was the number one champion in WWE history. The following night on \"SmackDown\", Styles and Bryan mocked Lesnar and Heyman, and said that Styles would overcome Lesnar.\nIntercontinental Champion The Miz kept his spot in the Survivor Series match by retaining his title against Matt Hardy on the October 30 episode of \"Raw\". Baron Corbin also kept his spot by retaining the United States Championship against Sin Cara on the November 14 episode of \"SmackDown\". Also on the October 30 episode of \"Raw\", Alexa Bliss retained the Raw Women's Championship against Mickie James, keeping her in the Survivor Series match against the SmackDown Women's Champion; her opponent was originally Natalya, but was changed to Charlotte Flair, who defeated Natalya for the title on the November 14 episode of \"SmackDown\". On the November 6 episode of \"Raw\", Cesaro and Sheamus defeated Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins to become the Raw Tag Team Champions, thus making them the champions for the Survivor Series match against The Usos (Jey and Jimmy Uso) who, despite losing by count-out, retained their SmackDown Tag Team Championship against Chad Gable and Shelton Benjamin on the November 7 episode of \"SmackDown\".\nAs Raw General Manager Kurt Angle was about to reveal the members for Team Raw's men's team on the October 23 episode of \"Raw\", SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon with several SmackDown wrestlers came through the crowd. They proceeded to the backstage area and attacked the wrestlers of Raw. The following night on \"SmackDown\", SmackDown General Manager Daniel Bryan was surprised that Angle and members of the Raw brand did not invade SmackDown, but warned Shane that they would eventually show up for retribution. That same episode, Team SmackDown's men's team got its first member when Randy Orton qualified by defeating Sami Zayn. The following week, Shane made himself the captain of Team SmackDown and explained their invasion of Raw, stating that SmackDown had always been looked at as the inferior brand. He also said that Raw would pay for injuring Bryan, who Kane had attacked with a chokeslam the previous night on \"Raw\". Later that episode, Bobby Roode and Shinsuke Nakamura qualified for the team by defeating Dolph Ziggler and Kevin Owens, respectively. The last spot for Team SmackDown was originally going to be determined the following week in a match between AJ Styles and Rusev, but that match was canceled after Styles was scheduled to face Jinder Mahal for the WWE Championship that episode. Rusev instead faced Orton to qualify, but failed to defeat him. The following day on Twitter, Shane named John Cena, a non-exclusive wrestler who could appear on both \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\", the final member of Team SmackDown.\nRaw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon made her return on the October 30 episode of \"Raw\" and confronted Kurt Angle; her last appearance as Raw's Commissioner was at WrestleMania 33. She said that SmackDown's invasion was an embarrassment to Angle and the entire Raw locker room. She then gave Angle the opportunity to redeem himself by naming Angle the captain of Team Raw's men's team. However, she said that if Team Raw were to lose at Survivor Series, Angle would be fired as the Raw General Manager. Afterwards on Twitter, Angle named Braun Strowman as his first pick for Team Raw. The following week, after their match ended in a double count-out, Samoa Joe and Finn Bálor were both added to Team Raw by Angle. Later that episode, Angle named Jason Jordan as the final member of Team Raw. The very next week, however, Stephanie disagreed with Angle's final pick and said that she wanted to decimate SmackDown. Later in the show, Jordan was (storyline) injured by a returning Bray Wyatt, and rendered unable to compete by Angle. Jordan begged Angle to not remove him from the Survivor Series match. Angle could not bring himself to do it, after which, Chief Operating Officer Triple H returned (his first appearance on \"Raw\" since WrestleMania 33), attacked Jordan with a \"Pedigree\", and declared himself Jordan's replacement. The following night on \"SmackDown\", during a tag team match between The New Day and Owens and Zayn, Raw invaded SmackDown by attacking the roster. After everyone was taken out, Shane McMahon was attacked, suffering an Angle Slam by Angle and two Triple Powerbombs by The Shield.\nTeam Raw's women's team began to take shape also on the October 23 episode of \"Raw\". A triple threat match between Alicia Fox, Bayley, and Sasha Banks was scheduled to determine the captain for Team Raw, which was won by Fox. The following week, Fox was originally scheduled to face Bayley, but as Team Raw's captain, she instead had Nia Jax face Bayley, which Jax won. After the match, Fox chose Jax as her first pick for Team Raw. Fox then added Asuka to the team after the latter defeated enhancement talent Stacy Coates. Later, she added Banks to the team after Banks and Bayley defeated Fox and Jax in a tag team match. Bayley won the final spot on Team Raw by defeating Dana Brooke and Mickie James in a triple threat match on the November 13 episode of \"Raw\". On the October 24 episode of \"SmackDown\", Becky Lynch, Carmella, Charlotte Flair, Naomi, and Tamina were named as the five members of Team SmackDown's women's team; Becky Lynch became captain by defeating the other four in a fatal five-way match. The following week, Becky said that Team SmackDown needed to be ready if Raw were to invade them. Then-SmackDown Women's Champion Natalya interrupted and said it was unfortunate that she was not the captain, but would defeat Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss. She also said that Lynch needed to find who the weak link was on their team. Flair was then removed from the team after winning the SmackDown Women's Championship, and she was replaced by former champion Natalya.\nOn the November 6 episode of \"Raw\", during Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins' Raw Tag Team Championship defense against Cesaro and Sheamus, SmackDown's The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) appeared in the crowd to make Raw believe that SmackDown were invading them again. General Manager Kurt Angle signaled for the Raw locker to go after The New Day. During the distraction, Sheamus pinned Rollins to win the Raw Tag Team Championship for him and Cesaro. Roman Reigns, who had been out with an illness, returned the following week and The Shield challenged The New Day to a six-man tag team match at Survivor Series, which was made official. The following night on \"SmackDown\", The Shield invaded SmackDown during New Day's tag team match against Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn. Owens and Zayn bailed while The Shield attacked The New Day.\nAt Raw's pay-per-view , Enzo Amore defeated Kalisto to recapture the WWE Cruiserweight Championship. Kalisto invoked his championship rematch on the following episode of \"205 Live\", but Amore retained after he was disqualified for attacking the referee. Kalisto then attacked Amore out of anger. The following week on \"Raw\", Kalisto defeated Drew Gulak, who had Amore in his corner. After the match, Amore attacked Kalisto with the JawdonZo. Another rematch between the two for the Cruiserweight Championship was scheduled for the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show.\nOn November 19, just prior to the event, WWE scheduled two non-interpromotional matches for the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show: Raw's Elias and Matt Hardy were scheduled to face each other, and SmackDown's tag teams Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn and Breezango (Fandango and Tyler Breeze) were scheduled for a match.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, Elias faced Matt Hardy. In the end, Elias threw Hardy into the ring post and performed a \"Drift Away\" on Hardy to win the match.\nNext, Enzo Amore defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. In the climax, Kalisto hit an exposed turnbuckle, which allowed Amore to perform the \"JawdonZo\" on Kalisto to retain the title.\nIn the last pre-show match, Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn faced Breezango (Fandango and Tyler Breeze). Owens performed a pop-up powerbomb on Fandango to win the match.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with The Shield facing The New Day. During the match, Woods performed a Double \"Midnight Hour\" on Rollins and Ambrose, who were on top of Big E's shoulders. Reigns performed a spear on Kingston. Ambrose countered a clothesline attempt by Big E with a \"Dirty Deeds\". In the end, Ambrose, Reigns, and Rollins performed the triple powerbomb from the second rope on Kingston followed by Ambrose pinning Kingston to win the match, opening the event with 1-0 for Raw.\nNext, Team Raw (Alicia Fox, Sasha Banks, Bayley, Asuka, and Nia Jax) faced Team SmackDown (Becky Lynch, Naomi, Carmella, Natalya, and Tamina) in a 5-on-5 elimination match. The team captains, Fox and Lynch, started the match. Bayley tagged in and eliminated Lynch with a roll-up. Carmella performed a superkick on Bayley followed by a \"Samoan Splash\" by Tamina to eliminate Bayley. Tamina attacked Jax with a crossbody and performed a \"Samoan Splash\" off the steel steps on Jax: Jax was unable to answer the referee's ten count and was eliminated. Naomi reversed a \"Tilt-a-Whirl Backbraker\" from Fox into a Sitout Pin, to eliminate Fox. Banks applied the \"Bank Statement\" on Naomi to eliminate her. Asuka performed a roundhousekick on Carmella to eliminate her. Natalya applied the \"Sharpshooter\" on Banks to eliminate her. Asuka applied an armbar on Tamina to eliminate her and then applied the \"Asuka Lock\" on Natalya to eliminate her to win the match, leaving Asuka as the sole survivor of Team Raw and still undefeated in her WWE career and moving the score up to 2-0 for Raw.\nNext, Intercontinental Champion The Miz faced United States Champion Baron Corbin. In the end, Corbin countered a roundhouse kick by Miz and performed the \"End of Days\" on The Miz to win the match. SmackDown gained its first point, making the score 2-1.\nAfter that, Raw Tag Team Champions Cesaro and Sheamus faced SmackDown Tag Team Champions The Usos. In the end, Jey performed the \"Samoan Splash\" on Sheamus to win the match, tying the score at 2-2.\nIn the fourth match, Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss faced SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair. In the end, Flair applied the \"Figure Eight\" on Bliss and Bliss tapped out, with SmackDown taking the lead of 3-2.\nAfter that, Universal Champion Brock Lesnar faced WWE Champion AJ Styles. In the end, Styles applied the \"Calf Crusher\" on Lesnar only for Lesnar to slam Styles' head into the mat to release the hold. Styles performed a Pele Kick and a \"Phenomenal Forearm\" on Lesnar for a nearfall. As Styles attempted another \"Phenomenal Forearm\", Lesnar caught him in midair and executed the \"F-5\" on Styles to win the match, tying the score at 3-3.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Team Raw (Kurt Angle, Braun Strowman, Finn Bálor, Samoa Joe, and Triple H) battled Team SmackDown (Shane McMahon, Randy Orton, Bobby Roode, Shinsuke Nakamura, and John Cena) in a 5-on-5 elimination match, with the stipulation being that if Team Raw were to lose, Angle would be fired as Raw General Manager. Strowman pinned both Nakamura and Roode after running powerslams. Joe and Bálor began to argue which allowed Cena to perform \"Attitude Adjustments\" on both, eliminating Joe by pinfall. Angle performed an \"Angle Slam\" on Cena only for Shane to break the cover. Cena was eliminated following a \"Coup de Gráce\" from Bálor and another \"Angle Slam\" from Angle. Orton countered a \"Coup de Gráce\" from Bálor and performed an \"RKO\" on Bálor for a pinfall. Shane was then attacked by Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn but managed to fight them off with a chair. Strowman pinned Orton after a running powerslam, leaving Shane as the last member of Team SmackDown. In the end, as Angle had Shane in the \"Ankle Lock\", Triple H turned on Angle, performed a \"Pedigree\" on Angle, and placed Shane on top of Angle to eliminate him. Triple H then performed a Pedigree on Shane and pinned him to win the match for Team Raw. After the match, a confused Strowman grabbed Triple H by the throat and warned him to never try something like that again. As Triple H attempted to attack Strowman from behind, Strowman retaliated with two running powerslams. As a result of the final match, Angle kept his position as Raw General Manager and Raw won brand supremacy 4-3.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night's \"Raw\" opened with Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon gloating about Raw defeating SmackDown at Survivor Series. She said that Kurt Angle's job as the Raw General Manager was secure, and then introduced \"the man responsible for [Raw's] victory\", her husband and COO Triple H. Before Triple H could speak, Angle interrupted and said that if Triple H were to ever attack him from behind again, he did not care about his job and would be coming for Triple H. Jason Jordan then came out and challenged Triple H to a match. Angle had him back down. Jordan said that Triple H was afraid and Stephanie retorted that Triple H was afraid of no one. Braun Strowman came out and confronted Triple H, who retreated. Stephanie then scheduled Jordan to face Strowman. The match ended in a no contest after Kane attacked Strowman. Kane and Strowman continued to feud over the next month, and it was decided that Brock Lesnar would defend the Universal Championship against Kane and Strowman in a triple threat match at the Royal Rumble, which Lesnar won to retain his title.\nThe Miz addressed his loss to United States Champion Baron Corbin and said that Corbin had the biggest victory of his career, but Miz was on the A-show. He then introduced his guest for \"Miz TV\", Roman Reigns, who was accompanied by both Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins. Miz said his segment was with Reigns, not the entire Shield. The Shield said that at Survivor Series, they proved that they were the most dominant three-man team in WWE history. Miz said that he deserved a \"thank you\" as it was because of him that The Shield reunited. Miz then gloated that he was a champion, holding up his Intercontinental Championship. Ambrose and Rollins said they would eventually recapture the Raw Tag Team Championship from Cesaro and Sheamus, and Reigns challenged The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship. In the main event, Reigns defeated Miz for the title, also becoming a Triple Crown Champion and a Grand Slam Champion in the process. The Miz regained the title in a rematch on the \"Raw 25th Anniversary\" episode on January 22, 2018; he also announced his participation in the 2018 Royal Rumble match just prior to that episode of \"Raw\".\nSamoa Joe and Finn Bálor tried to settle their Survivor Series differences in a match, which Joe won when Bálor passed out to the \"Coquina Clutch\". Elias came out to play a song and bragged about defeating Matt Hardy, who then attacked Elias. Bálor also formed the Bálor Club with Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson (all three being former members of New Japan Pro-Wrestling's Bullet Club of which Bálor was the original leader), and Matt became \"Woken\" Matt Hardy (WWE's version of \"Broken\" Matt Hardy from TNA) and started a feud with Bray Wyatt.\nIn the women's division, Raw's sole survivor Asuka had a match with Dana Brooke, who blamed Asuka for her not being on Team Raw at Survivor Series. Asuka subsequently defeated Brooke. Raw Women's Champion Alexa Bliss talked about her match against SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair, stating that she only had five days to prepare, but said she took Charlotte to her limits. She was then interrupted by Mickie James, Bayley, Sasha Banks, and Alicia Fox, who each wanted a shot at the Raw Women's Championship. A fatal four-way match between them to determine the number one contender ended in a no contest after being attacked by the returning Paige and the debuts of NXT's Mandy Rose and Sonya Deville, who would later be known as Absolution. On the December 18 episode of \"Raw\", the first women's Royal Rumble match, involving wrestlers from both Raw and SmackDown, was scheduled for the 2018 Royal Rumble.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon addressed Survivor Series. He stated that despite their loss, SmackDown would no longer be considered the B-show. He then called out Kevin Owens and Sami Zayn and was about to fire them for the attack at Survivor Series, when General Manager Daniel Bryan instead decided to have Owens and Zayn face The New Day, who they had bailed on the previous week, in a lumberjack match. When a brawl broke out ringside, Zayn and Owens capitalized on the distraction and defeated The New Day. Backstage, Owens begged for Bryan not to fire them and Bryan said he would not. Owens and Zayn were subsequently scheduled to fight for their jobs against Randy Orton and Shinsuke Nakamura in a tag team match at Clash of Champions, with Shane and Bryan as guest referees. Owens and Zayn won, keeping their jobs, and continued to feud with Shane McMahon.\nWWE Champion AJ Styles congratulated Brock Lesnar for his victory and accepted Jinder Mahal's challenge, who invoked his championship rematch for Clash of Champions. Styles was then attacked by The Singh Brothers, but fought them off. Styles defeated them in a handicap match the following week and went on to win at Clash of Champions.\nIn the women's division, Natalya invoked her championship rematch against Charlotte Flair for the SmackDown Women's Championship. Their match ended in a no contest after they were attacked by NXT's Ruby Riott, Liv Morgan, and Sarah Logan, who made their main roster debut as The Riott Squad. The trio had also attacked Naomi and Becky Lynch backstage earlier in the night. At Clash of Champions, Charlotte defeated Natalya in a lumberjack match to retain her title."

        "title": "Equestrian portrait",
        "text": "An equestrian portrait is a portrait that shows the subject on horseback. Equestrian portraits suggest a high-status sitter, who in many cases was a monarch or other member of the nobility, and the portraits can also carry a suggestion of chivalry.\nHistory.\nEquestrian statues were made at least as far back as Ancient Rome and the Hellenistic period. Images of the Thracian horseman were recurrent in reliefs and small statues between the fourth century BC and the fourth century AD, especially in Thrace and Moesia Inferior. The bronze Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Capitoline Museums of Rome, of which a replica stands in Piazza del Campidoglio, was erected around 176AD. Many other bronze statues of the time were melted down for reuse. After a period out of favour, equestrian portraits in Europe, including paintings, drawings and sculpture, revived during the Renaissance around the fifteenth century.\nExamples.\nMany equestrian portraits have been made of monarchs. Titian painted his \"Equestrian Portrait of Charles V\" in 1548. Anthony van Dyck painted \"Charles I with M. de St Antoine\" in 1633 and \"Equestrian Portrait of Charles I\" in 1635, as well as \"Charles I at the Hunt\" (an equine portrait rather than an equestrian portrait as the king is dismounted) in 1637–1638. Equestrian portraits of Napoleon include \"Napoleon Crossing the Alps\" (1801–1805) by Jacques-Louis David. A modern painting based on David's original entitled \"Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps\" was painted in 2005 by Kehinde Wiley, who also painted a version of Rubens' \"\" (1628) with Michael Jackson replacing the king.\nIn the iconography of Saint George and the Dragon, George is often portrayed on horseback, as in Rubens' painting \"Saint George and the Dragon\" (1605–1607). The same is true for some other warrior saints, including Demetrius of Thessaloniki and Theodore of Amasea, who are sometimes paired with George.\nEquestrian portraits of knights include those of the fictional knight-errant Don Quixote, of which there are many examples including a famous 1955 sketch by Pablo Picasso."

        "text": "The 2017–18 international cricket season was from September 2017 to April 2018. 28 Test matches, 93 One Day Internationals (ODIs), and 44 Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) were played during this period. Out of the 30 Test matches that were played four were day/night matches. The day/night Test match between South Africa and Zimbabwe was scheduled to last for only four days in duration, with the last such four-day Test match being played in 1973. The season started with India leading the Test cricket rankings, South Africa leading the ODI rankings, New Zealand leading the Twenty20 rankings, and England women leading the women's rankings. Additionally, the Laws of Cricket 2017 Code came into effect on 1 October 2017, superseding the 6th Edition of the 2000 Code of Laws, with many of the changes in the laws being incorporated into the ICC Standard Playing Conditions.\nThe season started with Australia's tour of India, which consisted of 5 ODIs and 3 T20Is. After this, 16 more bilateral series among the full member nations were scheduled for the remainder of the season. The most notable of these series was the 70th edition of The Ashes, which was held in Australia from November 2017 to January 2018. Other notable highlights included New Zealand beating England in a home Test series for the first since 1984 and South Africa beating Australia in a home Test series since 1970. Australia's tour of South Africa was also notable for the many disciplinary issues that occurred throughout, with the most serious of these incidents being a ball tampering scandal that resulted in Australian captain Steve Smith, vice captain David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft being suspended from international cricket for 12 months, 12 months, and 9 months respectively. In addition, the first two T20I Tri-Series (Trans-Tasman Tri-Series and the Nidahas Trophy) among Full Member nations ever were conducted.\nThe culmination of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup qualification process occurred in this season. The start of this season marked the cut off date for direct qualification for the World Cup from the ICC ODI Championship. The top eight teams at the cut off date gained direct qualification to the World Cup while the bottom four teams (West Indies, Zimbabwe, Ireland, Afghanistan) went into the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. These four teams were joined by the top four teams of the World Cricket League Championship and the top two teams of the World Cricket League Division Two to make up the ten teams that played in the World Cup Qualifier.\nThe final two rounds (rounds 6 and 7) of the World Cricket League Championship concluded in this season, with the top 4 teams (Netherlands, Scotland, Papua New Guinea, Hong Kong) qualifying for the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier. In addition, the Netherlands gained One Day International Status by winning the World Cricket League Championship and qualified for the 2020–23 ICC Cricket World Cup Super League. The bottom four teams (Kenya, Nepal, United Arab Emirates, Namibia) were relegated to World Cricket League Division Two for a chance to qualify for the final two spots of the World Cup Qualifier. These four teams were joined by Canada and Oman, the top two placed teams in the World Cricket League Division Three. The United Arab Emirates and Nepal finished in the top two and thus qualified for the World Cup Qualifier while Oman and Kenya finished in the bottom two and were relegated to Division Three. In the World Cup Qualifier, West Indies and Afghanistan were the top two finishers and thus qualified for the World Cup.\nIn addition, the Intercontinental Cup concluded during this season, with matches in rounds 6 and 7 played in this period. Afghanistan won the tournament after finishing at the top of the table with the most points.\nFinally, the qualification process for the 2020 ICC T20 World Cup got underway with the Americas Southern Sub Region Qualifier, which saw Bermuda and Cayman Islands qualify for the Americas Regional Qualifier. The Asia Western Sub Region Qualifier was also conducted, with the UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait qualifying for the Asia Regional Qualifier. The Africa North-Western Sub Region Qualifier saw Ghana and Nigeria qualify for the Africa Region Qualifier.\nRankings.\nThe following are the rankings at the beginning of the season:"

There were 9 boats (28 competitors) from 9 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the Danish team, rowers Finn Pedersen and Tage Henriksen and coxswain Carl-Ebbe Andersen; it was the first medal in the men's coxed pair for Denmark. Italy won its second consecutive silver medal (though 12 years apart), with Giovanni Steffè, Aldo Tarlao, and cox Alberto Radi. Hungary also earned its first medal in the event, a bronze for Antal Szendey, Béla Zsitnik, and cox Róbert Zimonyi. The French three-Games pre-war podium streak ended.\nBackground.\nThis was the seventh appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nNone of the 18 competitors from the 1936 coxed pair final returned. The Hungarian rowers were a slight favorite; Antal Szendey and Béla Zsitnik were the reigning European champions.\nArgentina, Great Britain, and Greece each made their debut in the event. France made its seventh appearance, the only nation to have competed in all editions of the event to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The tournament expanded to four rounds: quarterfinals, a repechage, semifinals, and a final.\nThe venue, Henley-on-Thames, imposed certain restrictions and modifications to the format. The course could handle only three boats at a time (and this required expansion of the typical Henley course), so the six-boat final introduced in 1936 was not possible this time. The course distance was also modified; instead of either the 2000 metres distance that was standard for the Olympics or the 1 mile 550 yards (2112 metres) standard at Henley, a course that was somewhat shorter than either was used. Sources disagree on the exact distance: 1929 metres is listed by the Official Report, though other sources say 1850 metres.\nResults.\nThe following rowers took part:"

Sweden took second place to earn the last spot in the final.\nFinal.\nThe start of the race looked as if it might be a replay of the first quarterfinal, with Australia and Canada battling for the lead and the United States in third, with a fourth boat (Sweden this time, rather than Great Britain) well behind. Canada took a clear lead just before the halfway mark. The United States, however, finally pulled ahead in the latter half and were able to hold off Canada. Australia kept close for most of the way but tired at the end.\nResults summary.\nThe following rowers took part:"

There were 18 boats (54 competitors) from 18 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The three nations on the podium were the same as those in 1956, though in a different order (and with only 1 of the 9 individual competitors being the same). The event was won by the United Team of Germany (bronze in 1956), with Bernhard Knubel and Heinz Renneberg rowing with Klaus Zerta the coxswain. Zerta is the youngest confirmed male gold medalist in Olympic history at 13 years and 283 days, just beating Hans Bourquin (also in the men's coxed pair, in 1928) by 9 days. The 1900 men's coxed pair gold-medal-winning coxswain may have been younger (estimates range from 7 to 12 years old), but the identities and ages of most coxswains in that event, including the gold medalist, are not known. The Soviet Union, bronze in 1956, took silver this time with Antanas Bagdonavičius, Zigmas Jukna, and Igor Rudakov. Defending champions the United States took bronze; Conn Findlay was the only man from the 1956 podium to return, this time with Richard Draeger as his rowing partner and Kent Mitchell the coxswain.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nOnly 1 of the 12 competitors from the 1956 coxed pair final returned: Conn Findlay from the gold-medal United States team. The United Team of Germany had been dominant the last few years other than their second-place finish to the Americans in the 1956 Games, winning four European championships with various crew compositions.\nCzechoslovakia, Romania, Spain, and Uruguay each made their debut in the event. The United States made its eighth appearance, matching the absent France for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). \nThis rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (heats and final), as well as a repechage round that allowed teams that did not win their heats to advance to the final."

The event was won by the United Team of Germany in its debut in the event (the rowers were from West Germany; Germany had previously won four times). Silver went to the French crew, the nation's first medal in the event since 1936. The defending champions Italy received bronze this time. In an event which saw constant turnover even from consistently strong nations, three members of the Italian team returned from the 1956 gold-medal crew to earn a second medal this Games: Romano Sgheiz, Ivo Stefanoni, and Franco Trincavelli were only the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th men to earn multiple medals in the coxed four.\nBackground.\nThis was the 11th appearance of the event.

The Olympic team for the United Team of Germany was a West German crew, including three of the members of the 1959 European champion team; it was heavily favoured. Italy, the reigning champions and 1960 Olympic hosts, returned three members of their crew but had not found success since their victory in Melbourne.\nRomania made its debut in the event; East and West Germany competed together as the United Team of Germany for the first time.

It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side).

The remaining 2 boats (5th and 6th place in the repechage) competed in the \"B\" final for 7th and 8th place.\nAll races were over a 1,000 metre course."

        "text": "The men's quadruple sculls competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place on the Han River Regatta Course, South Korea.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (heats, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 13 boats were divided into three heats for the first round, with 4 or 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each heat (9 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 4 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured a single heat; the top three boats advanced to the semifinals, while the last place boat was eliminated (13th place overall). The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th.\nAll races were over a 2000 metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on 20 September, a sunny day with 17–18 °C temperatures and 0.9–1.1 m/s west to west-northwest winds. The top three boats in each heat advanced to the semifinals, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nHeat 1.\nThe first heat saw the Hungarian boat take an early lead, by 0.42 seconds over the East Germans at the 500 metre mark. Hungary, however, had the worst second 500 metres of any team and fell back to fourth place. Australia took the lead by halfway; they and East Germany battled for the top spot, but both had little doubt that they would advance. Poland had taken over the third spot when Hungary fell back, and the contest between those two would decide the last advancement place. Hungary was behind by nearly a second at the 1500 metre point, but was able to successfully overtake Poland in the last quarter. The United States trailed the entire way.\nHeat 2.\nThe second heat had the Soviets leading at the halfway mark, followed by the West German team. Italy made a strong push in the second half, however, passing both boats to claim the lead. Czechoslovakia trailed the entire time, becoming the only boat from this heat to be sent to the repechage.\nHeat 3.\nThe odd team out in the third heat quickly became clear, as Argentina was behind the third place team by 2 seconds at 500 metres and by 3 seconds at 1000 metres. The gap continued to widen and Argentina finished nearly 11 seconds out of the final advancement spot. Within the lead group, Canada led early but Norway established control by the halfway mark. The Netherlands passed Canada as well in the final quarter stretch.\nRepechage.\nThe single-heat repechage was held on 21 September, a sunny and warm (23.6 °C) day with 1.3 m/s west-northwest winds. The top three boats in the repechage advanced to the semifinals, with the 4th place boat being eliminated at 13th place overall.\nPoland started strong and led at the halfway mark, but had the slowest third and fourth quarters of the field and dropped back into second as Czechoslovakia pushed forward into the lead. The battle for third place was between Argentina and the United States; the Americans held a 2.57 lead at halfway, but the Argentine team made up more than a second of that in between 1000 and 1500 metres and finished with a final quarter more than 2 seconds faster than the Americans, passing them and avoiding elimination.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 22 September, a sunny day with roughly 20 °C temperatures. The wind was at 1.3 m/s south for the first heat and picked up to 2.2 m/s for the second. The top three boats in each semifinal advanced to the \"A\" final, with the bottom three going to the \"B\" final, out of medal contention.\nSemifinal 1.\nThe first semifinal featured a strong start from the West German team, leading at 500 metres. Italy, however, claimed the lead by the halfway mark and retained it the rest of the way. The East German team also passed the West squad in the second half. This put the West German team at risk of missing the \"A\" final; they had to fight off a challenge from the Dutch team, though did so without much difficulty, finishing about 2 seconds ahead. Hungary kept close early, but fell back in the second half. Argentina was never in serious contention, though did manage to pass Hungary in the last quarter.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe second semifinal resulted in numerous changes of order and a tight race for the third and last advancement place. Czechoslovakia had the slowest start, in sixth place at 500 metres. At that point, the Soviets, Poles, and Australians were in the top 3 spots. By halfway, Norway had jumped from fifth to second behind the Soviet Union. Czechoslovakia had caught Canada; Canada would trail the remainder of the way. At 1500 metres, the Soviets and Norwegians had solidified their top two spots and the race for third came down to Czechoslovakia (which had taken that spot), Poland (2 seconds behind), and Australia (2.1 seconds behind). Australia finished strong, overtaking the other two boats to reclaim third place and advancement to the \"A\" final.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final was held on 23 September, a sunny day with 17.5 °C temperatures and 0.6 m/s west-southwest wind. The six teams in the race competed for 7th through 12th place. Canada led early and maintained the lead through the 1500 metre mark, but faltered in the last quarter and dropped to third (and nearly to fourth). Poland and the Netherlands jockeyed for second and third throughout much of the race, taking advantage of Canada's weak final 500 metres to move into first (Poland) and second (the Netherlands). Hungary and Czechoslovakia made second-half pushes to get by Argentina, but neither could quite catch Canada.\nFinal A.\nThe \"A\" final was held on 25 September. The temperature was 18 °C, the weather was sunny, and wind was 2.9 m/s northeast. East Germany led at 500 metres, followed closely by Italy. The East Germans could not keep the pace, however, and by the halfway mark Italy had taken the lead, with the Soviet Union second and East Germany third. This order held through 1500 metres (with Italy widening its lead to 3 seconds), before the Norwegian squad made a strong push to pass the Soviets and East Germans. Norway was far enough behind Italy to not seriously challenge for the gold, but took silver. The East Germans outpaced the Soviets in the last quarter, taking the bronze medal. Australia trailed West Germany slightly for fifth place throughout most of the race, but passed the West Germans near the end."

        "text": "The men's coxless pair competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at took place at Han River Regatta Course, South Korea.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (heats, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 18 boats were divided into three heats for the first round, with 6 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat (3 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 15 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured three heats, with 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each repechage heat (9 boats total) advanced to the semifinals. The remaining 6 boats (4th and 5th placers in the repechage heats) were eliminated. The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th.\nAll races were over a 2000 metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on 19 September. The winner of each heat advanced to the semifinals, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nHeat 1.\nThe first heat featured a warm (18 °C) but rainy day, with 1.0 m/s northwest winds. The Soviet Union led early, with a half-second margin over Romania at 500 metres. The Romanians had a strong second 500 metres, though, and took a halfway lead which they maintained. Belgium slowly but surely moved up from fourth to second; the United States also passed the Soviets in the second half of the race. Brazil took fifth and Canada trailed significantly throughout.\nHeat 2.\nBy the second heat, the rain had stopped but the day remained cloudy. The temperature had risen to 18.9 °C, with calmer winds (0.7 m/s, south-southwest). Yugoslavia led throughout, followed by France most of the way. East Germany passed France in the final 500 metres. Australia, Finland, and Japan were widely spaced in fourth through sixth places.\nHeat 3.\nIt was cloudy and 17 °C for the third heat, with 0.9 m/s west-southwest wind. The top three places remained static, with Great Britain leading, West Germany second, and Austria third at each quarter mark. The other boats had more changes in position, with Norway starting in fourth before falling back to sixth. Spain ended up in fourth, with Argentina fifth.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on 21 September. It was a sunny day, with the temperature warming from 15.7 °C for the first heat to 17.3 °C by the third. There were 1.3 m/s south-southwest winds to begin, shifting to east-southeast for the second heat, and calming to 0.3 m/s south-southwest in the third. The top three boats in each heat advanced to the semifinals, with the 4th and 5th placers being eliminated.\nRepechage heat 1.\nEast Germany took an early lead, with Canada close behind at 500 metres. By the halfway mark, the field had begun to solidify into two groups, with East Germany, the United States, and Finland in the lead group and Spain and Canada (having fallen all the way back to last) in the second group. That grouping, which would eliminate the latter two teams, held through the rest of the race. East Germany briefly fell to third at the 1500 metre mark but regained the lead over the last quarter-race.\nRepechage heat 2.\nNorway made the only personnel change of the event, swapping Audun Hadler-Olsen in for Ole Andreassen. Australia started strong, leading at the 500 metre and 1000 metre marks. But the Australian rowers had the weakest third quarter of any of the five boats, dropping all the way back to fourth place as Belgium charged from fourth to first. Austria and Brazil were in the second and third places. The leading three increased their separation from fourth-place Australia and fifth-place Norway in the last 500 metres.\nRepechage heat 3.\nFrance held the lead for most of the race, through the 1500 metre mark. The West Germans were in third at 500 metres but gained on the French over the next two quarters and passed them in the final 500 metres of the race. The Soviet Union came to a relatively easy third-place finish, with Argentina and Japan never seriously threatening to advance.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on 22 September. It was a sunny and warm day, rising from 19.4 °C to 23.9 °C between the first and second heats. It was windier for the first semifinal (1.8 m/s, south) than the second (0.6 m/s, east-northeast). The top three boats in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final, while the 4th through 6th place boats went to the \"B\" final out of medal contention.\nSemifinal 1.\nAustria and Finland were not competitive from the start, essentially making this a four-way race for three advancement spots. Yugoslavia led at the 500 metre mark before Romania took control and ran away with the top spot. Two teams from the third repechage, West Germany and the Soviet Union, each spent time in the fourth spot, with the Soviets creating some separation in the third quarter and widening it in the final segment.\nSemifinal 2.\nGreat Britain took an early, significant lead—over 2.3 seconds by 500 metres—and increased it through the first three-quarters of the race before coasting to the win. France was in second place at 500 metres before falling all the way back to fifth at 1000 metres. The United States was in the second position at the halfway and three-quarter marks, but could not hold the pace and was passed by Belgium, East Germany, and France in the final quarter. Those three had similar splits in the last 500 metres, which kept France from advancing as the French team finished fourth.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe classification or \"B\" final was held on 23 September. It was sunny but cool (13 °C) at race time, with 2.6 m/s east-southeast wind. France and West Germany battled for the lead in this race, with France leading through halfway but West Germany finishing with the win (and 7th place overall). The United States and Brazil were third and fourth, respectively, at each quarter-mark; the Brazilians did have to survive a late press from Finland. Austria fell into last place by a significant margin (nearly a full minute behind the fifth-place Finland) during the third 500 metres, and finished the final quarter in over 4 minutes.\nFinal A.\nThe main or \"A\" final was held on 24 September, a sunny 20.1 °C day with 2.2 m/s northeast wind. The three heat winners maintained the top three positions throughout, with Great Britain in first, Romania in second, and Yugoslavia in third. Belgium was sixth through the 500 metre mark, but moved up to fourth by halfway and stayed there. East Germany and the Soviet Union were also fairly well locked into the fifth and sixth places, respectively, at halfway. No boat finished within a second of another."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1988 Summer Olympics – Men's coxed pair",
        "text": "The men's coxed pair competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at Misari Regatta, South Korea. It was held from 20 to 25 September. There were 14 boats (42 competitors) from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by Italian crew Carmine Abbagnale, Giuseppe Abbagnale, and coxswain Giuseppe Di Capua; they were the second crew to repeat as Olympic gold medalists (and would go on to be the only crew to win three medals with a silver in 1992). It was Italy's fourth victory in the event, most all-time among nations over the United States and East Germany at three. The East Germans, after winning their three gold medals consecutively from 1972 to 1980 before missing the 1984 Games due to the Soviet-led boycott, returned with a silver medal performance in Seoul by Mario Streit, Detlef Kirchhoff, and cox René Rensch. Great Britain took its first-ever medal in the event with a bronze by Andy Holmes, Steve Redgrave, and cox Patrick Sweeney. \nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nEight of the 18 competitors from the 1984 coxed pair Final A returned: the full Italian gold medalist crew of Carmine Abbagnale, Giuseppe Abbagnale, and Giuseppe Di Capua; the two rowers from the silver-medal Romanian crew, Dimitrie Popescu and Vasile Tomoiagă (this time joined by the 1980 fourth-place team coxswain Ladislau Lovrenschi; American bronze-medal rower Robert Espeseth; and rower Ángelo Roso Neto and coxswain Nilton Alonço from the fourth-place Brazil team. The Italian trio had been rowing together for two full Olympic cycles, earning 4 golds, a silver, and a bronze in the 6 World Championships from 1981 through 1983 and 1985 through 1987 along with their Olympic gold. The other two World champion nations during that time were East Germany (1983, sending a different crew) and Great Britain (whose Andy Holmes, Steve Redgrave, and cox Patrick Sweeney had won in 1986). The Romanian rowers had taken a silver (1985) and bronze (1987) at Worlds before teaming with Lovrenschi.\nNew Zealand made its debut in the event. The United States made its 14th appearance, matching the absent France for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (heats, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 14 boats were divided into three heats for the first round, with 4 or 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each heat (9 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 5 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured a single heat, with the top three boats advancing to the semifinals and the remaining 2 boats (4th and 5th placers in the repechage) being eliminated (13th and 14th place overall). The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe quarterfinals were held on September 20. It was a sunny but cool day (14 °C for the first heat, rising steadily to 16 °C for the third), with fairly calm winds (less than 1 m/s for each heat). The top three boats in each heat advanced to the semifinals, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nQuarterfinal 1.\nBulgaria led early, including by nearly a second at the halfway mark, but the East German team had a strong second half and passed Bulgaria for the lead. The other three teams had already started separate by 500 metres; at 1500 metres, 7 seconds separated New Zealand in third place (the last semifinal advancement spot) from Canada in fourth place. Canada and fifth-place Brazil did narrow the distance somewhat in the final 500 metres, but the gap was insurmountable.\nQuarterfinal 2.\nThe top three boats jockeyed for position, while Poland and Ireland never threatened to break into the advancing group. The Americans held the lead at the 500 metre and 1000 metre marks. Yugoslavia was in second at the 500 metre point, but was passed by the Soviets before halfway. The Soviets captured the lead from the United States in the third quarter of the course, and Yugoslavia passed the Americans as well in the final 500 metre stretch.\nQuarterfinal 3.\nThe final heat was not competitive in terms of who would advance; Czechoslovakia fell behind early and only increased the gap as the race went on. The top thee boats remained relatively tightly packed, with Italy building up a small lead (1.6 seconds over Great Britain and 2.3 seconds over Romania) through the first 1500 metres and holding off late pushes from the other two teams in the last 500 metres to maintain a narrow win. Less than a second separated first from third at the finish.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on September 21. It was a sunny and warmer day (22.3 °C), with 1.1 m/s west-northwest wind. The top three boats advanced to the semifinals, while 4th and 5th place were eliminated (13th and 14th overall). Brazil fell significantly behind early. Ireland stayed within a second of third place through the 1500 metre mark, but could not maintain the pace in the last 500 metres and fell back from the lead group—and even behind Brazil, which pushed hard to avoid last place. Within the lead group, Poland held the lead at halfway but Czechoslovakia had a strong second half to pull away to a wide margin of victory. Canada, in third the entire race, made an effort to catch Poland for second at the end but came up short.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on September 22. It was a warm, sunny day (23 °C), with winds of 1.6 m/s west-northwest in the first heat calming to 1.1 m/s west for the second. The top three boats in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final, with the bottom three eliminated from medal contention and placed in the \"B\" consolation final (except for New Zealand, which withdrew).\nSemifinal 1.\nNew Zealand withdrew. Italy led wire-to-wire, recording the best time in the event in Olympic history. The East Germans and Romanians battled for second place, with East Germany prevailing over the second half. Neither Yugoslavia nor Poland had much chance at breaking into the top three, finishing 9 and 13 seconds out of third, respectively.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe second semifinal was a five-way race for three spots in the \"A\" final through the halfway mark. Bulgaria had the lead from the start, with the Soviets, Brits, Americans, and Czechoslovakians fairly close behind. Canada was over 3 seconds out of fifth place at that point, and while the Canadians had a better second half than first, they would not come close to reaching the top three. In the third quarter of the race, Czechoslovakia and especially the United States fell off the pace of the lead group; Czechoslovakia passed the Americans but saw their gap to third place Great Britain widen to 3 seconds. The Brits made a charge in the final quarter of the race, passing the Soviets and nearly catching Bulgaria; the latter team held them off, though, and won by 0.28 seconds. Canada caught their southern neighbors in the last 500 metres, as well.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final for 7th through 11th place (with only 5 boats due to New Zealand's semifinal withdrawal) was held on September 23, with 16.9 °C cloudy weather and a 1 m/s east-southeast wind. Czechoslovakia led from the start, increasing the margin over each 500 metre stretch. Yugoslavia held second place throughout. The United States held third place through the first half of the race but once again had a slow third quarter, allowing Poland to overtake them. Canada—just as it had in the semifinals—finished strong, passing the Americans once again in the final quarter and nearly catching Poland for third place.\nFinal A.\nThe final was held on September 25, a sunny day with 17.2 °C temperatures and 2.2 m/s northeast winds. It was dominated by Italy, which jumped to an over 2 second lead at 500 metres and never was seriously challenged. Bulgaria kept closest through most of the race, second place at each of the quarter, half, and three-quarter marks, but could not maintain their speed in the final quarter. The East Germans jumped from fifth to second in the final stretch; Great Britain and Romania each passed Bulgaria but were passed by East Germany to hold the third and fourth places they had held since halfway. The Soviets had been competitive early (third through 500 metres) but fell to sixth by 100 metres and were well out of any contention for better than that."

There were 10 boats (90 competitors) from 10 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by West Germany, the nation's first victory (and first medal) in the men's eight since 1968. It was West Germany's second gold medal in the event, tying Great Britain and East Germany for second-most, behind the United States with 11. In a photo finish for second place, the Soviet Union took silver over the United States.\nBackground.\nThis was the 20th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe United States had dominated the men's eight for four decades from the 1920s through the 1950s, but had not taken Olympic gold since 1964. A victory in the 1987 World Rowing Championships set up the Americans as favourites to return to the top of the Olympic podium, particularly as the East Germans (a power in the event in the 1970s and 1980s) were not competing for the second straight Games. Other significant contenders were the 1985 World champions the Soviet Union and the 1986 World champions Australia.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 17th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nThe competition consisted of two main rounds (heats and finals) as well as a repechage. The 10 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 5 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat (2 boats total) advanced directly to the \"A\" final. The remaining 8 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured two heats of 4 boats each, with the top two boats in each heat (4 boats total) advancing to the \"A\" final and the remaining 4 boats (3rd and 4th placers in the repechage heats) being eliminated from medal contention and sent to the \"B\" final to determine 7th through 10th places."

        "text": "The men's coxed pair competition at the 1992 Summer Olympics took place at Lake of Banyoles, Spain. It was held from 28 July to 2 August. There were 16 boats (49 competitors, with Czechoslovakia making one substitution) from 16 nations, with each nation limited to one boat in the event. The event was won by brothers Greg and Jonny Searle and coxswain Garry Herbert of Great Britain, the nation's first victory in the event. It was the third consecutive Games with brothers winning as the rowers; Italy's Carmine Abbagnale and Giuseppe Abbagnale had won in 1984 and 1988. They, along with longtime cox Giuseppe Di Capua, took silver this year, becoming the only crew to win three medals together in the event (only one other man, Conn Findlay, had earned three medals, with three different rowing partners and two different coxswains). Bronze went to Romanians Dimitrie Popescu, Nicolae Țaga, and cox Dumitru Răducanu. Popescu and Răducanu had been on the 1984 silver medal team, making them the 16th and 17th—and final—men to earn multiple medals in the event. \nBackground.\nThis was the 18th and final appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nFive of the 18 competitors from the 1988 coxed pair Final A returned: the two-time reigning champions Carmine Abbagnale, Giuseppe Abbagnale, and Giuseppe Di Capua of Italy; fourth-place rower Dimitrie Popescu of Romania, reunited with his 1984 silver-medal teammate coxswain Dumitru Răducanu; and fifth-place cox Stefan Stoykov of Bulgaria. The Italian crew was exceptionally consistent (having rowed together for three full Olympic cycles) and was an overwhelming favourite, with four consecutive World Championships (and 7 of 9 starting in 1981, with silver and bronze in the other two years) along with their two Olympic golds.\nLithuania made its debut in the event, while some other former Soviet republics competed as the Unified Team. The United States made its 15th appearance, most among nations.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 16 boats were divided into three heats for the first round, with 5 or 6 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat (3 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 13 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured three heats, with 4 or 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each repechage heat (9 boats total) advanced to the semifinals.

Germany won the only World Championship between reunification and the Games, in 1991, and was favoured in Barcelona.

Four rowers crew each boat, and no coxswain is used. The competition consists of multiple rounds. Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals.\nWith 14 boats in with heats, the best boats qualify directly for the semi-finals.

        "text": "A bronze equestrian statue of Field Marshal Gustaf Mannerheim stands in the centre of Helsinki, Finland. It was made by Aimo Tukiainen and erected in 1960.\nThe bronze statue is tall. It is raised on a granite plinth, tall, 6.3 m long and m wide.\nAs a general, Mannerheim had been a symbolic figure in Finland since the Finnish Civil War in 1918, and his position grew stronger during the Second World War as a field marshal. The first plans and fundraising for an equestrian statue started in 1937. After his death in 1951, the plans were relaunched by initiative of the Helsinki University Students' Union.\nDuring the fundraising campaign 737,503 members of the public donated over 78 million marks in 1952. The funds were sufficient not only for the statue but also for purchasing the Louhisaari mansion in Askainen, Mannerheim's place of birth, which was turned into a museum.\nThe statue was commissioned from Aimo Tukiainen after a competition. Tukiainen made a realistic and detailed statue of the horse-riding Mannerheim. At its unveiling in 1960, the art world considered it outdated. In his contemporary works Tukiainen himself had already moved on from realism.\nThe features of the horse, its gait and which of the marshal's horses it actually represents have been discussed a lot. During his life Mannerheim owned several horses. Tukiainen studied Mannerheim's last horse Käthy when working on the statue, but it is not a portrait of her as such.\nThe construction of the Kiasma museum of contemporary art next to the statue was debated during the time of construction of the museum."

        "text": "On 2 December 2015, at the Theresienbad swimming pool in the Austrian capital Vienna, a 10-year-old boy was raped. The perpetrator, an Iraqi refugee who had arrived in the country two months earlier, claimed that he was motivated by not having sex for four months.\nThe crime became public knowledge in February 2016, and in June the man was sentenced to a minimum six years in jail. In October, the Supreme Court of Austria overturned his rape conviction and ordered a retrial. At the retrial his sentence was increased to 7 years. In May 2017, the man's sentence was reduced to four years.\nThe crime was one of several at the time which led to anti-refugee sentiment in Austria, and the overturning of the original conviction was condemned by Russian president Vladimir Putin.\nBackground and incident.\nThe perpetrator was born in Iraq and had arrived in Vienna in September 2015, finding work as a taxi driver.\nThe victim is the son of a Serbian refugee.\nThe man raped the boy in a toilet room cubicle, causing physical injury, and then went diving. The child, known as Goran, told a lifeguard and the man was arrested.\nLegal proceedings.\nThe crime was not made public knowledge until February 2016, with the police giving the reason as to protect the victim. Thomas Keiblinger, spokesman of police in Vienna, denied that the incident had been covered up because the perpetrator was a refugee.\nThe perpetrator said that he had not had sex for four months as his partner had been ill since giving birth, so he \"followed his desires\" because he had \"a marked surplus of sexual energy\" and knew that his act would be illegal in any country of the world. His defence lawyers mentioned his youth, living conditions and no criminal record in mitigation.\nIn court, it was heard that the victim had been profoundly disturbed by the crime, and was considering suicide. His family was awarded €4,700 in compensation. The man was sentenced to six years in prison in June 2016, with a maximum 15 years, and possible deportation at the end.\nIn October 2016, the Austrian Supreme Court overturned the man's conviction of rape, ordering a retrial, while upholding his second charge of aggravated sexual assault of a minor. The rationale was that the prosecution had not provided evidence that the man did not know that his victim did not consent. The man was kept in police custody until his retrial where his sentence was increased to 7 years and the compensation award increased.\nIn May 2017, judge Thomas Philipp reduced the sentence to four years in a final decision by the Supreme Court, saying that the rape was a \"one-off incident\" and \"you cannot lose your sense of proportion here\".\nReaction.\nThe crime led to a rise in anti-refugee sentiment in Austria. \"The New York Times\" mentioned it and the gang rape of a grandmother in Traiskirchen as incidents that were causing a growth in support for the Freedom Party of Austria candidate Norbert Hofer in the 2016 election.\nVladimir Putin, the president of Russia, spoke after the original conviction was overturned, a rare comment by him on the refugee crisis. He said \"It doesn’t fit into my head what on earth they’re thinking over there. I can’t even explain the rationale – is it a sense of guilt before the migrants? What’s going on? It’s not clear. A society that cannot defend its children has no future\"."

Two teams from WCL Division Two were added for the 2011–13 WCL Championship, making eight teams in total.

They were subsequently promoted to the ICC ODI Championship, although the 2015–17 WCL Championship remained an eight-team competition as two additional teams were promoted from Division Two."

        "title": "2017 Indianapolis 500",
        "text": "The 2017 Indianapolis 500 (branded as the 101st Running of the Indianapolis 500 presented by PennGrade Motor Oil for sponsorship reasons) was a Verizon IndyCar Series race held on Sunday May 28, 2017, at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, United States. The race was the premier event and the sixth race of the 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series season.\nDespite a threatening weather forecast in the days leading up to the event, the race ran its scheduled distance of 200 laps (500 miles) and was won by Japanese driver Takuma Sato of Andretti Autosport. Sato, who also finished on the podium at the 2004 U.S. Grand Prix on the road course at Indianapolis, became the first Asian driver to win the Indianapolis 500. Sato assumed the lead with six laps to go and held off Hélio Castroneves over the final fifteen miles.\nTwo violent crashes occurred during the month, involving Sébastien Bourdais (during time trials) and Scott Dixon (during the race), respectively. Bourdais suffered a broken pelvis and other injuries, forcing him to sit out the event, while Dixon suffered a minor ankle injury.\nAlexander Rossi entered the race as the defending champion. The event also featured Fernando Alonso, the first active Formula One World Championship driver to contest the race since Teo Fabi in 1984. Alonso was voted Rookie of the Year, having led 27 laps before retiring in the closing stages of the race.\nThe month of May activities formally began on May 13 with the fourth running of the IndyCar Grand Prix on the combined road course. Practice for the Indianapolis 500 began on May 15, and time trials were held on May 20–21. Scott Dixon, the 2008 winner, won the pole position, his third career Indy pole. Dixon's qualifying speed of was the fastest pole speed since 1996. Carb Day—the traditional final day of practice, as well as the annual Pit Stop Challenge and Indy Lights Freedom 100, were held on May 26. Support races featuring the Road to Indy were also held during the month.\nRace background.\nThe 2017 race was the third and final year contested with the Chevrolet and Honda aero kits outfitted to the Dallara DW12 chassis. Beginning in 2018, all DW12 chassis were outfitted with a universal bodywork kit. Furthermore, a development freeze was implemented for 2017, and all aero kits had to adhere to the established specifications carried over from 2016.\nAmong the major offseason moves, Chip Ganassi Racing switched engine manufactures from Chevrolet to Honda. Conversely, A. J. Foyt Enterprises switched from Honda to Chevrolet. KV Racing Technology, who won the 2013 race with driver Tony Kanaan, was sold to Juncos Racing, an established team in the ladder system, scheduled to make its debut at the Indianapolis 500. After losing his seat at KV Racing, Sébastien Bourdais subsequently signed with Dale Coyne Racing. Among the other high-profile moves, Josef Newgarden departed Ed Carpenter Racing and joined Team Penske.\nRegulations and rule changes.\nA series of procedural rule changes were implemented by the series for the 2017 season, however, none of the rule changes significantly affected the Indianapolis 500. The IndyCar Grand Prix, which opens the on-track activities for the month, a three-day event, had only two days for the Verizon IndyCar Series. That mirrors similar changes made to other races event weekends on the schedule.\n2017 IndyCar season.\nThe 101st Indianapolis 500 was the sixth round of the 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series season, and the 22nd sanctioned as part of the Indy Racing League/IndyCar Series. There were five different winners in the first five races leading up to the Indianapolis 500. The season began March 12 at St. Petersburg, with Sébastien Bourdais a surprise winner. Bourdais won from last place on the starting grid. James Hinchcliffe won at Long Beach, his first victory since suffering a near-fatal accident during practice for 2015 Indianapolis 500. Josef Newgarden won at Barber, and defending series champion Simon Pagenaud won at Phoenix. The IndyCar Grand Prix was won by Will Power, his second victory in the event.\nEntering the month of May at Indy, Honda-powered teams were the prohibitive favorites over the Chevys. As the week began, Honda teams were even being accused of \"sandbagging.\" However, each day saw a different driver lead the speed charts, split almost evenly between both manufacturers. Honda began experiencing multiple engine failures, raising significant concerns around the garage area of their reliability.\nEntry list.\nFormer Indianapolis 500 winners that were entered include Hélio Castroneves, Juan Pablo Montoya, Buddy Lazier, Scott Dixon, Tony Kanaan, Ryan Hunter-Reay, and Alexander Rossi. Former IndyCar Series champions that entered include Lazier, Dixon, Kanaan, Hunter-Reay, Will Power and Simon Pagenaud. In addition, Juan Pablo Montoya is a former CART series champion, and Sébastien Bourdais is a four-time champion of the Champ Car World Series. Montoya, after three years in a full-time role at Team Penske, went down to a part-time role for 2017, driving in the IndyCar Grand Prix and Indianapolis 500 only.\nOn April 12, it was announced that two-time Formula 1 World Champion Fernando Alonso planned to drive a Honda with the support of McLaren for Andretti Autosport. Alonso skipped the 2017 Monaco Grand Prix in order to compete at Indianapolis.\nRookies that entered included Alonso, Jack Harvey, Ed Jones, and Zach Veach. The official entry list was released on May 14.\nTesting and rookie orientation.\nPrivate testing – Friday, March 24.\nA private manufacturers test for Honda teams was scheduled for Friday March 24. The test was moved up one day due to inclement weather predicted for Saturday. Three Honda teams, Chip Ganassi Racing, Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing, and Schmidt Peterson Motorsports, tested along with one Chevy team (Team Penske). A total of eleven drivers took to the track on a warm, but windy day. No incidents were reported. Speeds were not reported. Attention during the test focused on Ganassi taking their first laps at the Speedway with Honda power since 2013, after a highly publicized switch from Chevrolet to Honda during the offseason.\nPrivate testing – Sunday, April 2.\nA private test conducted by Chevrolet teams was scheduled for Saturday April 1. Cold temperatures postponed the test until Sunday April 2. Three Chevrolet teams were scheduled to participate. No incidents were reported.\nPrivate testing – Wednesday May 3.\nA private test was scheduled for May 3 involving Fernando Alonso. Marco Andretti started the day off, shaking the car down shortly after 9:00 a.m. Alonso took to the track and passed all three phases of his rookie test. Alonso completed 110 laps with a best lap of 222.548 mph. Due to rain approaching the area, the test schedule for the day was slightly compressed, in order to complete all three phases before the weather arrived.\nThe test was broadcast as a live stream through IndyCar's social media channels, with combined live viewership of the test was estimated to be in excess of 2 million.\nRookie orientation – Monday May 15.\nThe Rookie Orientation Program (ROP) was scheduled for Monday from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. Four rookies were slated to participate in the session, Fernando Alonso, Jack Harvey, Ed Jones, and Zach Veach. Track time for refresher tests was also available for Jay Howard, Oriol Servià, and Sebastián Saavedra. The three-phase rookie test requirements for 2017 consisted of ten laps at 205-210 mph, fifteen laps at 210-215 mph, and fifteen laps at over 215 mph. The two-phase refresher test consists of ten laps at 210-215 mph and fifteen laps at over 215 mph.\nAlonso had passed his rookie test previously on May 3, but was permitted the additional track time during the session. Ed Jones passed his rookie test at 1:08 p.m., while Jack Harvey experienced gearbox trouble, which delayed him taking to the track for almost one hour. Harvey passed only the first phase of the test after fuel pressure issues sidelined him even further. Veach made no attempt to complete his rookie program, turning in only three laps late in the session. Veterans Howard, Servià, and Saavedra all completed their refresher programs during this time.\nTime trials first day.\nFirst Day — Saturday, May 20.\nThe first day of time trials locks in the 33 cars that will comprise the starting field, and determines the nine cars eligible to participate in the Fast Nine Shootout for the pole position on Sunday. The start of qualifications was delayed until 4:01 p.m. due to a heavy thunderstorm. As a result of the delays, all drivers were given only one qualifying attempt.\nSébastien Bourdais crash.\nThe day was marred by a heavy accident involving Sébastien Bourdais. After completing his first two laps at 231.472 mph and 231.595 mph (the two fastest laps of the day), Bourdais lost control and crashed nearly head-on into the SAFER Barrier in turn two and did a half-flip before coming to rest upright part-way down the backstretch. Bourdais was extracted from his car and immediately sent to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital where he was diagnosed with multiple pelvic fractures and a hip fracture, rendering him unable to compete in the race.\nRemainder of day 1.\nDespite Honda's dominance in the speed charts during the week, it was Chevrolet driver Ed Carpenter who turned the fastest attempt of the day, with a four lap average of 230.468 mph. Joining him in the Fast Nine were Takuma Sato, Scott Dixon, J. R. Hildebrand, Alexander Rossi, Will Power, Fernando Alonso, Tony Kanaan, and Marco Andretti. Rookie Ed Jones was the first driver outside the Fast Nine. Team Penske was surprisingly lackluster during the session, with four of the team's five drivers failing to make the Fast Nine; Power being the lone exception. Rookie Zach Veach made no attempt to qualify on the day due to damage from a crash in the previous day's practice. The only other minor incident of the day involved Pippa Mann, the first car out to qualify on the green track. After a clean first lap, the car stepped out in turn three and nearly tagged the wall in the north short chute. Mann's last three laps dropped off substantially, but she completed the four-lap run 219.282 mph, the slowest car of the day.\nTime trials second day.\nPositions 33 through 10 — Sunday, May 21.\nEarly showers slightly delayed the morning warm-up session, but the skies stayed clear for the rest of the day and qualifying was run as scheduled. Prior to qualifying, Dale Coyne Racing announced that James Davison would fill in for the injured Bourdais in the No. 18 car.\nAs Davison had not driven in a Verizon IndyCar Series race since 2015, he was prohibited from participating in Sunday's qualifying session under Rule 4.3.8.7, an Indianapolis 500-specific rule mandating a driver who had not participated in an oval race prior to the previous year's Indianapolis 500 pass the refresher test (the second and third phases of the rookie test). Furthermore, the backup #18 car needed to be converted from road course to oval trim.\nThe group from positions 10-33 began qualifying first at 2:45 p.m., running in the reverse order of how drivers qualified in the previous day's session. Zach Veach, having made no attempt on Saturday, was first on course. The day saw, for most drivers, faster speeds thanks to lower temperatures and more rubber on the track than the previous day. Ryan Hunter-Reay was fastest of the session with a four-lap average of 231.442 mph; nearly a full mph faster than anyone else in the first group. Alongside him in the 4th row were Ed Jones and Oriol Servià. Team Penske once again struggled, with Juan Pablo Montoya in 18th being their highest qualifier in the group. No major incidents occurred during the session, though a few drivers, including Jack Harvey and Charlie Kimball, scraped the wall in turn 2 during their runs.\n\"NOTE: Per INDYCAR Rule 8.4.9, Davison, who was ineligible to participate in qualifying, was classified by the Entrant Points of the #18 car during the current season.\"\nFirestone Fast 9 — Sunday, May 21.\nFast Nine qualifying began at 5:00 p.m., with each driver given one shot to reach pole position. Scott Dixon took the pole position with a four-lap average of 232.164 mph; the fastest four-lap average since Arie Luyendyk's track record run in 1996. In addition, his first lap of 232.565 mph was the fastest since Luyendyk's track-record 237.498 mph lap, also in 1996. The run was the third fastest pole speed in 500 history, behind only Scott Brayton's 1996 run and Roberto Guerrero's 1992 run. Joining Dixon on the front row were Ed Carpenter, the highest qualified Chevrolet, and defending winner Alexander Rossi. Fernando Alonso stunned during the session, qualifying fifth in his first ever start on an oval circuit.\nAlonso's day did not start out entirely smooth, as Honda officials ordered a last-minute engine change in the car. After examining data from the engine, it was decided to install a new engine, with only an hour and a half until the car was due to be in line for technical inspection. The team scrambled to finish the work, and got the car prepared with only minutes to spare. Takuma Sato had a potential front row starting position until his handling went away on his final two laps, and he subsequently brushed the wall in turn two.\nPost-qualifying practice &amp; Carb Day.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe Pit Stop Challenge was scheduled for Friday May 26. For the first time in event history, the finals were a best-of-three format. In addition, the set up was revised such that both cars start the race on asphalt pavement. Previously, one lane was asphalt and one was concrete, putting one lane at a grip disadvantage. Due to an earlier engine failure in James Hinchcliffe's #5 car, Hinchcliffe drove Jay Howard's #77 car for the Pit Stop Challenge.\nIn the second quarterfinals heat, Ed Carpenter was assessed a 5-second penalty due to an unsecured lug nut on the left-front wheel. In the final round, Schmidt Peterson Motorsports (James Hinchcliffe) faced Team Penske (Will Power) in a best two-out-of-three matchup. By virtue of the fastest individual time during the semifinals, Power was awarded lane choice for the first finals heats, and selected the left lane. The teams swapped for the second heat. Power had the best time from the first two finals heats, and was awarded lane choice for the third and final heat. He subsequently selected the left lane again.\nRace.\nFirst half.\nStart.\nRace day saw temperatures in the mid range with partly cloudy skies. For the first time since 2014, all 33 cars were able to take the green flag to start the race. At the start, Scott Dixon moved into the lead, while Will Power managed to jump up to second from his ninth place start. However, he soon faded and Tony Kanaan moved into second. On lap 6, Kanaan moved past his teammate Dixon for the lead, while Alexander Rossi held third. Indy 500 rookie Fernando Alonso made a slow start, but quickly began moving his way back up to sixth by lap 19. As pit stops neared, Dixon began to slip down the order, losing second to Rossi and third to Ed Carpenter. The first round of stops came at lap 29, with Kanaan being the first of the leaders to pit. After the sequence, however, Carpenter had moved into the lead, with Rossi second, Alonso third, Kanaan fourth, and Takuma Sato fifth. During the cycle, Jay Howard ran out of fuel, placing him several laps off the pace.\nThe Andretti Autosport teammates Rossi and Alonso soon dispatched Carpenter, and on lap 37 Alonso moved into the lead. The two dueled for the lead, with Rossi taking back the lead on lap 43, before Alonso returned the favor on lap 48.\nLap 53 crash &amp; red flag.\nOn the 53rd lap of the race, Jay Howard drifted wide in turn 2 after being passed by Ryan Hunter-Reay, sending him into the wall. Howard's car drifted across the track after the impact and straight into the path of Scott Dixon. Dixon's car was launched off the back of Howard's, sending Dixon into an airborne flip, before crashing down into the inside wall and piercing a hole in the catch fencing. The force of the crash ripped nearly the entire rear assembly from Dixon's machine. Miraculously, neither Dixon nor Howard were injured in the incident. However, extensive repairs were needed for the catch fencing, forcing the race to be red flagged. After 18 minutes of red flag time for the repairs, cars were fired back up and the race resumed under caution with Fernando Alonso still in the lead after subsequent yellow flag pit stops. During the caution, Hélio Castroneves was forced to make repairs to his car after taking minor damage in his attempt to avoid Dixon's car, forcing him back to 22nd.\nSecond quarter.\nWhen racing finally resumed, Alonso held the lead over his teammates Rossi and Takuma Sato. On lap 61, Rossi returned to the lead, while Sato and Ryan Hunter-Reay both moved past Alonso for position. On lap 65, Sato moved into the lead for the first time of the race. Two laps later came the race's second caution period, as Conor Daly lost control of his car in turn 3 and crashed into the outside wall while trying to make a pass. In the midst of the wreck, Jack Harvey spun attempting to avoid Daly's debris, sending him into the inside wall in the North \"short-chute,\" taking him out of the race as well. During the caution, Castroneves was assessed a drive-through penalty for jumping the previous restart.\nThe next restart saw Rossi move back around Sato for the lead, while both Hunter-Reay and Tony Kanaan moved around Sato in the following laps to move themselves into second and third respectively. This green flag run was short-lived, though, as caution flew once again on lap 81 as a winglet from Marco Andretti's car broke off and landed on the course on the front straight. The majority of the field elected to pit during the caution, with Hunter-Reay leading Rossi and Alonso out of the pit lane. However, Will Power, Max Chilton, and Hélio Castroneves elected to stay out having made pit stops only six laps earlier during the previous caution, thus placing the trio at the head of the race.\nThe restart saw Chilton immediately snag the lead away from Power, but by lap 86, those that had pitted during the caution returned to the head of the field. Power began to fall back, while Castroneves and Chilton remained toward the front end of the field. On lap 96, Castroneves moved into the lead of the race after passing Hunter-Reay, while Kanaan moved back into the top five after passing his teammate Chilton.\nSecond half.\nHalfway.\nOn lap 104, Castroneves, still off sequence from the previous caution, surrendered the lead to make a pit stop, opening up the cycle of green flag stops while handing the lead back to Hunter-Reay. The majority of the field came in around lap 110, with Hunter-Reay resuming the lead with a margin over three seconds to his teammate Rossi. Alonso, Castroneves, and Power rounded out the top five. The gaps were erased on lap 122, when Buddy Lazier lost control of his car in turn 2 and hit the wall, bringing an end to the former winner's day. During the ensuing caution, Sage Karam's race came to an end when a dead battery caused him to grind to a halt on course.\nRacing resumed on lap 129, with Hunter-Reay ahead of Alonso and Rossi. One lap later, though, Alonso moved back into the lead of the race. No sooner was the pass complete when caution waved again, this time for debris on the front straight. The brief caution ended on lap 135, with Alonso and Hunter-Reay switching the lead back and forth before Alonso won out on lap 136. However, pre-race concerns about Honda reliability came to fruition that same lap, as Hunter-Reay's engine suddenly began to smoke on the back straight before slowing and coming to a halt just before the pit entrance. Caution once again waved. Most leaders pitted under this period, Alonso leading the field off pit lane. Rossi, however, suffered major fueling issues, dropping him down outside the top 20. Several drivers elected not to pit during the period, including Max Chilton, Charlie Kimball, J. R. Hildebrand, James Davison, and Ed Jones.\nThe restart saw Kimball grab the lead from Chilton, but caution waved near immediately, as Ed Carpenter did a half spin and punched a hole in the sidepod of Mikhail Aleshin's car, breaking Carpenter's front wing and sending debris across the track in turn 1. Racing resumed on lap 147, with Chilton quickly moving back around Kimball. On lap 149, Graham Rahal's hope of Indy victory was dashed when a deflating tire forced him to pit under green.\nFourth quarter.\nWith the race drawing to its closing stages, Hélio Castroneves began moving back up the field, and by lap 151 moved into fourth, while James Davison moved into second ahead of him. Further back, Takuma Sato began moving back toward the front, moving to eighth by the end of lap 163. On lap 166, Chilton made what would be his final pit stop, moving James Davison to the lead. Davison, by leading a lap, became the first driver since Alex Tagliani in the 2016 Indianapolis 500 to lead laps after starting last. Caution flew nearly immediately after this, as Charlie Kimball's engine gave up in similar fashion to Hunter-Reay's. At the same time, rookie Zach Veach rolled to a halt on the back straight, his day done as well. Nearly the entire field pitted during the caution, with Ed Jones and Castroneves leading the charge off pit lane. However, having just made a green flag stop, Chilton resumed the lead of the race. The running order was now Chilton, Jones, Castroneves, Davison, and Sato.\nRacing resumed with Chilton in control, but Castroneves began to duel with Jones for second. Behind them, Sato moved to fourth after passing Davison. Eventually, Sato managed to pass both Castroneves and Jones, allowing him to pursue Chilton ahead. Behind them, other Honda cars began attempting to move forward, but on lap 179, Fernando Alonso (then running 7th) fell out of the race as his engine failed coming down the front straight; the third Honda failure of the race. Caution once again bunched up the field.\nRacing resumed on lap 184, with Castroneves managing to take third away from Jones. Just behind, chaos erupted in the field when Davison and Oriol Servià made contact in turn 1 triggering a multi-car pile-up that involved Davison, Servia, Will Power, James Hinchcliffe, and Josef Newgarden. Of the five, only Newgarden was able to resume, but only after losing several laps.\nFinish.\nRacing resumed with 11 laps to go with Chilton maintaining his lead over Sato. On lap 192, Castroneves was able to make a pass on Sato for second. One lap later, he managed to move around Chilton, placing the Brazilian in the lead of the race. However, Sato passed Chilton shortly thereafter and, one lap later, moved around Castroneves to take the lead. Castroneves made one last attempt to pass Sato with three laps to go, but was ultimately unable to catch back up to Sato. Takuma Sato took victory by just .2011 seconds over Castroneves, while Jones came across the line in third. By taking the win, Sato became both the first driver from Japan and the first driver from Asia to take victory in the 500. Sato also became the first driver to win the Indianapolis 500 and finish on the podium in a United States Grand Prix hosted at Indianapolis, having finished third in 2004. It also marked the first time since 2011 that the winner of the race came from the first three rows. The victory was the third in four years for the Andretti Autosport team.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from Time Trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised live in the United States on ABC. Allen Bestwick was the lead play-by-play announcer for the race, joined by Scott Goodyear and Eddie Cheever. The race took place just after the highly publicized 2017 ESPN layoffs, of which both Bestwick and Punch were identified as casualties. Both Bestwick and Punch, and presumably the remainder of the contracted on-air crew, was officially terminated a week later after ABC's coverage of the Detroit Grand Prix. However, on February 7, 2018, ESPN communications director Andy Hall announced that the full IndyCar broadcast team, Bestwick and Punch included, would return for the 2018 season.\nThe broadcast utilized 96 cameras, with 14 cars equipped with three in-car cameras each, and the introduction of Visor Cam, which featured live, first-person camera angles from cameras mounted on the helmets of Graham Rahal and Josef Newgarden. Live in-car camera feeds were available online via WatchESPN. ESPN also introduced a new \"Race Strategist\" feature, which featured predictive analysis based on various factors that could affect the race. As with all other IndyCar Series events, ESPN International produced a world feed broadcast for international markets.\nIn the United States, the 2017 Indianapolis 500 was the least-watched edition of the race since the inception of live flag-to-flag coverage, with a 3.6 overnight Nielsen rating (down from 4.1 in 2016). The tape delayed broadcast in Indianapolis (the live broadcast was, as is customary, blacked out by WRTV) saw a 16% increase in viewership over 2015 (the last time the race was blacked out in Indianapolis, since the 2016 edition had its blackout lifted). By contrast, viewership in Spain was significantly high due to Fernando Alonso's debut, with 443,000 viewers and a 3.6% share, higher than the Formula One Monaco Grand Prix that occurred earlier in the day.\nCarb Day, the final practice session, along with the Pit Stop Challenge and Freedom 100, were carried on NBCSN. The booth announcers for NBCSN were Kevin Lee, Townsend Bell and Paul Tracy. The pit reporters were Marty Snider, Jon Beekhuis, Katie Hargitt, and Robin Miller. Lee was joined in the booth by Anders Krohn and Ed Jones the Freedom 100 coverage segment.\nRadio.\nThe race was carried live by the IMS Radio Network, part of the Advance Auto Parts IndyCar Radio Network. Mark Jaynes served as chief announcer for the second year. The crew for 2017 was largely the same from 2016. Once again, all living former chief announcers took part in the broadcast. Paul Page joined as a guest commentator in the booth, and Bob Jenkins appeared during the pre-race in a pre-recorded segment recapping the 25th anniversary of the 1992 race. Jenkins then served on the Speedway Public Address system team. Mike King also appeared during the pre-race coverage, narrating a pre-recorded segment recapping the IndyCar Grand Prix, and Dave Wilson narrated a tribute to John Andretti (a former IMS Radio Network analyst for the Brickyard 400) who was battling colon concer. During the race, Wilson interviewed vice president Mike Pence, then reported from the track hospital. For the second straight year, Michael Young interviewed the winner in victory lane.\nAmong the guests in the booth was Governor Eric Holcomb, Mark Reuss (GM), Matt Davis (Advance Auto Parts/Carquest), and James Verrier (BorgWarner). For the first time, the traditional commercial out-cue was recorded by a voice-over announcer instead of the chief announcer or drivers in the field. This was the final 500 in Turn 1 for Jerry Baker as he would depart the crew for and join the public address crew for 2018 when it was decided that Turn 1 would not be used in 2018 but due to a new broadcast booth debuting in 2019 named after Sid Collins, Turn 1's broadcasting location would be reinstated.\nAccording to a study from GfK Custom Research, the broadcast reached 20.5 million listeners, and averaged 8.8 million listeners per quarter hour. It represented a 75% increase in ratings over 2016, and the broadcast was carried on over 350 terrestrial radio affiliates, a 5% increase from 2016.\n1070 The Fan broadcast nightly beginning May 8 with \"Trackside with Curt Cavin and Kevin Lee\", followed by Donald Davidson's \"The Talk of Gasoline Alley\"."

        "text": "The men's double sculls competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at took place at Han River Regatta Course, South Korea.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (heats, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 17 boats were divided into three heats for the first round, with 5 or 6 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat (3 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 14 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured three heats, with 4 or 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each repechage heat (9 boats total) advanced to the semifinals. The remaining 5 boats (4th and 5th placers in the repechage heats) were eliminated. The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th.\nAll races were over a 2000 metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on September 19. The winner of each heat advanced to the semifinals, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round (a fact highlighted by the Swiss team, fourth place in their preliminary heat, ultimately winning the silver medal).\nHeat 1.\nThe first heat featured a warm (21 °C) but rainy day, with 2.3 m/s northwest winds. It was primarily a contest between the Soviets (who led the full way) and the Norwegians (who started slower and were fourth at 500 metres, but pulled into second before the halfway mark), though the Soviet victory was never much in doubt. Spain started out in third, was passed by Norway but passed Chile, and ended in third as well. Canada ran fifth for the first 1500 metres before also passing Chile and finishing fourth. Chile started strong, in second place at 500 metres, but steadily dropped back through the field and finished fifth. The United States trailed the field throughout.\nHeat 2.\nThe second heat was cooler (now 19 °C) and windier (5 m/s, west-northwest), but still rainy. It turned into a four-way race quickly, with Austria well behind after 500 metres and Mexico falling back as well by 1000 metres. At the halfway point, Bulgaria led followed by East Germany, Switzerland, then Denmark. The Germans and Danes pushed forward over the second half, while the Bulgarians and Swiss slowed. By the 1500 metre mark, the East German boat had overtaken Bulgaria and the Danish boat had passed Switzerland. In the last quarter of the course, Denmark surged past both the Germans and Bulgarians to take the victory.\nHeat 3.\nThe temperature continued to cool (18 °C) and the rain continued to fall for the third heat, though the wind calmed somewhat (3.7 m/s, west). There was little contest to this heat, with the Dutch boat leading from the start and winning by nearly 3 seconds. The West German team started slow, but caught Italy before the halfway mark and separated from the latter squad by over 4 seconds at the end. Finland and Greece brought up the rear at fourth and fifth place, respectively.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on September 21. The top three boats in each of the three repechage heats advanced to the semifinals, with all others eliminated.\nRepechage heat 1.\nThe repechage was held on a cool (13.9 °C for the first heat) but sunny day, with calmer winds than the heats (1.2 m/s east-northeast for the first heat). East Germany, after its narrow loss in the heats, led this repechage heat from start to finish. Finland and Spain battled back and forth for second and third, with Finland ultimately taking second. A late push by Mexico was insufficient to catch Spain for the last semifinals place. The United States made it to halfway in fourth place and not far behind the lead group, but faltered over the second half and finished fifth.\nRepechage heat 2.\nThe sunny day continued to warm (now 14.8 °C) and the wind remained steady (1.2 m/s, east-northeast). With all but one boat advancing the semifinals, the question was which team would finish last. Chile was only half a second behind third-place Norway at 500 metres, but fell further behind at each quarter-mark after that; the South Americans were eliminated. Switzerland led at each checkpoint, while Norway passed Italy during the second 500 metres.\nRepechage heat 3.\nThe temperature continued to warm (15.3 °C) and the sun continued to shine; the wind shifted slightly (1.8 m/s, east-southeast). It was the second repechage heat of the day won by a German team, with West Germany matching the East German squad's placement from the first repechage heat. It took a second-half push, as the Bulgarian pair led through the halfway mark. The remaining three boats each spent time in the essential third-place position to earn the last spot in the semifinals; Greece had it after the first 500 metres, and Austria was in advancement place after 1000 metres and 1500 metres, but Canada finished in the third spot. Austria fell to fifth with a nearly-three-minute final 500 metres.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on September 22. There were two heats of six boats each; the top half advanced to the \"A\" final while the bottom half went to the \"B\" final (out of medal contention).\nSemifinal 1.\nThe first semifinal featured heat winners the Soviet Union and Denmark, repechage winner West Germany, repechage second-placers Norway and Finland, and repechage third-placer Canada. It was a hot and sunny day, at 31.2 °C, with 1.4 m/s east-northeast wind. The Soviets led wire-to-wire, opening a nearly 3 second lead over the first 500 metres and never looking back. Norway started strong, but Denmark passed them before the halfway mark. West Germany made a late charge from fourth place to overtake both Norway and Denmark. This left third-place, and the last spot in the \"A\" final, to a battle between the two Scandinavian countries. Norway gained back ground in the last 500 metres, but was unable to catch Denmark, finishing a quarter-second behind. Canada and Finland were clearly behind the others throughout, flipping places between them after the halfway mark as Canada finished fifth and Finland sixth.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe second semifinal featured heat winner the Netherlands, repechage winners East Germany and Switzerland, repechage second-placer Bulgaria, and repechage third-placers Italy and Spain. The temperature had cooled from the first semifinal (now 24.1 °C) and the wind was nearly calm (0.7 m/s, southwest). Bulgaria took the early lead, but was soon passed by East Germany. The top four remained relatively close throughout, with the Germans retaining the lead and winning by 1.68 seconds over the Netherlands. The Dutch, along with the Swiss, had been closing on the Bulgarians since the halfway mark. Switzerland, after a slow second quarter, had the best final 500 metres, passing Bulgaria to move into third by 0.34 seconds (and the \"A\" final advancement spot) but not quite catching the Netherlands (0.42 seconds behind) for second. Italy had briefly passed Switzerland around the halfway mark, but otherwise was in fifth throughout; Spain was last from the first quarter-mark to the finish.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nFinal B, for 7th through 12th place, took place on September 23. It was a cool day, at 12.4 °C, but sunny. The winds were 2.6 m/s east-southeast. All three of the boats from the second semifinal beat the boats from the first semifinal. Spain, which had finished last in the semifinal, this time defeated Bulgaria and Italy, as well as the rest, to take 7th place overall. It required a last-to-first drive, however, as Spain was in sixth place in the heat after 500 metres—though only behind leaders Bulgaria by 2.23 seconds. Bulgaria held the lead through 1500 metres before being passed by Spain, finishing second in the race and 8th overall. Italy ended up in 9th overall. The boats from the other semifinal came in fourth/10th (Canada), fifth/11th (Norway), and sixth/12th (Finland).\nFinal A.\nFinal A, for 1st through 6th places, was held on September 24, a temperate (20.7 °C), sunny day with 1.5 m/s northeast wind. The Soviets started with the lead, followed by the East and then West Germans. But none of those three teams finished higher than third; the Netherlands surged first, advancing from fourth place at the quarter-mark to second at the halfway point and then first—where they would finish—three-quarters of the way in. The Swiss also made a late push, charging all the way from fifth at the halfway mark (and fourth at 1500 metres) to edge out the Soviets for the silver medal by 0.28 seconds. The West German team, behind their East German counterparts most of the way, passed them as well in the last quarter as the East team dropped to fifth place. East Germany finished closer to last place Denmark than to fourth place."

The event was won by the team from Romania.\nBackground.\nEast Germany had won the coxless pair competition at every Summer Olympics since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico, and they were the reigning world champion. The Soviet Union had won silver at the last Summer Olympics in this event, had won the 1981 World Rowing Championships, and had won silver in 1983. With both nations absent due to the Soviet Bloc boycott, the only competing nation that had won recent world championships was Norway, which had won the title in 1982.

        "text": "The men's double sculls competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at took place at Lake Casitas, California, United States of America.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition consisted of two main rounds (heats and finals) as well as a repechage. The 11 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 6 boats in one heat and 5 boats in the other. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the \"A\" final (1st through 6th place). The remaining 9 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured two heats, with 5 boats in one heat and 4 boats in the other. The top two boats in each repechage heat went to the \"A\" final. The remaining 5 boats (3rd, 4th, and 5th placers in the repechage heats) competed in the \"B\" final for 7th through 11th place.\nAll races were over a 2000-metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on 30 July. It was a warm day (27 °C) with a very slight (.05 m/s) west-southwest wind. The winner of each heat advanced to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round (a fact highlighted when Yugoslavia, the last-place finisher in the second heat, went on to earn the bronze medal).\nHeat 1.\nThe first heat saw all six boats relatively closely packed through the first 500 metres. By the halfway mark, the West Germans had begun to establish a lead. For those first two quarter-marks, the Swiss were in second place. By the 1500 metre mark, however, Switzerland had fallen back to fifth (where they remained) while the Americans began to creep up on the leaders. The United States narrowed the gap somewhat, but the Germans still won comfortably, by 1.5 seconds. The Norwegians and Austrians had a close contest for third and fourth place. Mexico's strong start—third place at the quarter-mark—petered out into a last-place finish 5.5 seconds behind fifth-place Switzerland.\nHeat 2.\nThe second heat was not competitive at the top, with well over 3 seconds between first and second, 4 seconds between second and third, and 2 seconds between third and fourth. The last two places came down to a close finish, though, with Canada edging out Yugoslavia by only 0.10 seconds. Belgium ran first the entire way, with Finland in second for the first half before being overtaken by the Italian team over the third 500-metre stretch.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on 2 August. It was a cooler day (18 °C) with no wind. The winner and runner-up in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final, with all others going to the \"B\" final—out of medal contention.\nRepechage heat 1.\nThe 2nd, 4th, and 6th place boats from the first heat joined the 3rd and 5th place boats from the second heat in this repechage. Yugoslavia, having taken last place in its preliminary heat, set out determined to avoid a similar fate in the repechage. They led the American pair by 0.15 seconds after 500 metres and by 0.19 seconds after 1000 metres. The other three boats were well enough back at that point that it would take a significant charge to alter the top two, who would advance; none was forthcoming. After 1500 metres, the Americans had passed Yugoslavia for a slight lead of 0.26 seconds. Yugoslavia fell further behind the leaders over the last 500 metres but were never seriously challenged for second place and a spot in the main final. Mexico, Finland, and Austria battled for placement, with Mexico dropping from third at 500 metres back to fifth at 1000 and 1500 metres before pulling back up to third at the end. Finland prevailed over Austria in a tight contest for fourth.\nRepechage heat 2.\nThe 2nd and 4th place boats from the second heat and the 3rd and 5th place boats from the first heat contested this repechage heat (with Switzerland swapping Winkler out and Steinemann in). It became obvious quickly that both advancement places would go to the second-heat competitors, Canada and Italy. At the 500 metre quarter-mark, Norway was 2.7 seconds behind Italy for second place; Canada held a slight lead for first. Italy took over in the second 500 metres, racing to a full second lead over Canada while Norway dropped to 3.7 seconds out of second place. Switzerland, at this point, was over 6 seconds behind Norway and clearly out of the running. Italy maintained its lead over Canada through the 1500 metre point, but the Canadians turned the 1 second deficit into a 0.6 second win in the final quarter of the race.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final, for 7th through 11th places, was held on 3 August. It was a warm day (23 °C) with a 0.5 m/s east wind. Austria and Finland went back and forth for the top two spots, with Austria leading at the quarter-mark, Finland leading at the half-mark and three-quarters-mark, and Austria finishing in the lead by 0.09 seconds. The Swiss boat was in third place at 500 metres and fourth place at 1000 metres before permanently falling back to last place (5th in the race, 11th overall). Mexico, which had finished after both Norway and Switzerland in the heats, now prevailed against them, finishing third in the \"B\" final and 9th overall.\nFinal A.\nThe main final was held on 5 August. The temperature was 20 °C and there was a 0.5 m/s east-northeast wind. The Belgian and Canadian pairs led at the start, with Belgium half a second ahead of Canada and 1.5 seconds ahead of Yugoslavia at the 500 metre mark. West Germany and Italy followed, with the United States at the rear. At the halfway point, the race appeared to belong to the Belgians, who had opened a 2-second lead against Yugoslavia as Canada fell back to fourth place. The Americans had passed Italy by halfway, as well. The American charge did not stop, either, as they pulled into second place at 1500 metres, though Belgium's lead was now nearly 2.5 seconds. Yugoslavia was about 1 second behind the Americans, and the West Germans were 1 second behind the Yugoslav team. Canada, followed by Italy, were well out of medal contention three-quarters through the race. Over the final 500 metres, the Americans completed their last-to-first push, taking the final quarter in 3.76 seconds less than the leading Belgians to win by over 1.3 seconds. Yugoslavia was able to hold off West Germany for bronze, while Canada finished its fall from second to sixth when Italy passed them in the final quarter. "

        "text": "The men's coxed pair competition at the 1984 Summer Olympics took place at Lake Casitas, California, United States. It was held from 31 July to 5 August. There were 12 boats (36 competitors) from 12 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the Italian crew, brothers Carmine Abbagnale and Giuseppe Abbagnale and coxswain Giuseppe Di Capua. It was Italy's first victory in the event since 1968 and third overall, tying the United States and East Germany for most among nations to that point. The Abbagnale brothers and Di Capua would go on to repeat as champions in 1988 (the second crew to repeat) and take silver in 1992 (the only crew to earn three medals together; Conn Findlay was the only other individual to earn three medals, doing so with three different rowing partners and two coxswains). The Romanian crew of Dimitrie Popescu, Vasile Tomoiagă, and cox Dumitru Răducanu took silver (the nation's first medal in the event since 1972). Americans Kevin Still, Robert Espeseth, and cox Doug Herland took bronze (the nation's first medal in the event since 1964). The three-Games gold-medal streak for East Germany ended with that nation joining the Soviet-led boycott.\nBackground.\nThis was the 16th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's coxed pair was one of the original four events in 1900, but was not held in 1904, 1908, or 1912. It returned to the programme after World War I and was held every Games from 1924 to 1992, when it (along with the men's coxed four) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nWith the Soviet-led boycott keeping out many of the top nations in the event (including three-time reigning gold medalists East Germany as well the Soviets themselves, silver medalists the last two Games), only 1 of the 18 competitors from the 1980 coxed pair Final A returned: Zlatko Celent, a rower from the bronze medalist Yugoslavia crew. Seventh-place finishers Italy brought back two of their three crew members, rower Giuseppe Abbagnale and coxswain Giuseppe Di Capua, swapping out Antonio Dell'Aquila to include Abbagnale's brother Carmine Abbagnale. This crew had taken gold at the 1981 and 1982 World Championships as well as bronze at the 1983 Worlds (behind an East German and a Soviet crew). The Italian trio was heavily favoured given the boycott.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. France made its 14th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed pair event featured three-person boats, with two rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912. The competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals) as well as a repechage after the semifinals. The competition consisted of two main rounds (heats and finals) as well as a repechage. The 12 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 6 boats in each heat. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the \"A\" final (1st through 6th place). The remaining 10 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured two heats, with 5 boats in each heat. The top two boats in each repechage heat went to the \"A\" final. The remaining 6 boats (3rd, 4th, and 5th placers in the repechage heats) competed in the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th place.\nResults.\nSemifinals.\nThe semifinals were held on July 31. It was a warm day (23 °C) with a 1 m/s east-northeast wind. The winner of each heat advanced to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nSemifinal 1.\nRomania led throughout, taking a five second lead by the halfway mark and winning by over five and a half seconds. The Yugoslav, American, and West German boats (in that order) were close together through 1000 metres (less than half a second between second and fourth), but separated over the second half of the race. France and Peru were close neither to the lead group nor to each other throughout the course of the contest.\nSemifinal 2.\nAs with the first heat, there was little question which boat would win the second heat. Italy led early and finished with a five-second win. Indeed, the final positions of the boats were established by 500 metres; the order did not change at the 1000 metre mark, 1500 metre mark, or the finish.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on August 2. It was a warm day (24 °C for the first heat, 23 °C for the second) with no wind. The top two boats in each heat advanced to the \"A\" final, with all others going to the \"B\" final (out of medal contention).\nRepechage heat 1.\nThe British boat started off strong, leading at the quarter-mark. By halfway, however, the two teams from North America had moved into the lead, with Canada edging the United States by 0.2 seconds at 1000 metres. At 1500 metres, it was clear that the two teams from the Americas would advance, as they opened a five-second lead over the Europeans. The United States took the lead from Canada in the third 500 metres and held it over the fourth. France passed Great Britain in the fourth quarter, as well. Peru had been close over the first 500 metres but fell well behind all others by halfway, finishing 12 seconds out of fourth place.\nRepechage heat 2.\nThe second repechage heat was a three-way race for the two advancement spots through the first three-quarters of the contest. Brazil took a close lead at the 500 metre mark, followed by West Germany and Yugoslavia. That order reversed at the 1000 metre point, and Yugoslavia looked to have an advancement place when they opened the lead over third-place Brazil to 2.5 seconds at 1500 metres. But the Yugoslav rowers could not keep the pace and faltered in the final quarter, Brazil came charging ahead, and the final order flipped back to the first-quarter order: Brazil, West Germany, Yugoslavia. The final 500 metres was so poor for Yugoslavia that they finished 8 seconds out of second place. Spain and Belgium battled for fourth place over the first half, but Spain took a significant lead by the 1500 metre mark and Belgium was unable to close.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe consolation or \"B\" final, for 7th through 12th place, took place on August 3. It was a warm day (23 °C) with a 0.5 m/s east wind. Yugoslavia, which had come close to joining the \"A\" final, led from wire to wire, winning the race to take 7th place overall. Great Britain pressed them closely for a while, but fell further behind over the middle 1000 metres and finished 8th overall about 2 seconds behind Yugoslavia. France, Spain, and Belgium followed in a small group well behind the two leaders. Peru stayed with that group over the first 500 metres but could not keep pace and fell behind to finish in last place by 17 seconds.\nFinal A.\nItaly, just as it did in the second heat, led early and finished with a five-second win. The Americans and Romanians battled for silver and bronze, with the latter team holding the lead the whole way; the United States was within a second of Romania at 1500 metres but fell behind in the final 500 to a 1.6 second defeat. The race for fourth place was also close, with West Germany leading Brazil and Canada at the 500, 1000, and 1500 metre marks but unable to keep pace over the last quarter and falling to sixth. Brazil pulled away from Canada as well in the last 500 metres."

There were 7 boats (63 competitors) from 7 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. New Zealand had won the last two world championships, and the other strong team, East Germany, was absent from the event due to the Eastern Bloc boycott. This made New Zealand the strong favourite. But the final was won by Canada, with the United States and Australia the other medallists, and New Zealand coming a disappointing fourth.\nBackground.\nThis was the 19th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nEast Germany had for many years been the dominating country for this boat class. From the 1976 Summer Olympics to the 1980 Summer Olympics, the country won every gold at Olympic and World Rowing Championships level. At the 1981 World Rowing Championships, East Germany came in fourth place, with the Soviet Union winning gold. In 1982 and 1983, the event was won by New Zealand, with East Germany coming second on both occasions. With the Soviet Bloc boycott affecting the 1984 Summer Olympics, New Zealand was thus regarded as the strong favourite. Another medal contender was the United States; they had won the 1983 Pan American Games.\nChile made its debut in the event. The United States made its 16th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals), as well as a repechage round after the semifinals. However, neither the semifinals nor the repechage eliminated any boats; all seven teams advanced to the \"A\" final, and no \"B\" final was held. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes, except the final in which (very unusually) seven boats raced.\nResults.\nSemifinal.\nThe two semifinal heats were rowed on 31 July. The winner of each heat advanced to the final, while the remaining teams went to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nOne heat was rowed in the repechage on 2 August. All five teams advanced to the final.\nFinal.\nAll seven teams that entered the competition rowed in a single final on 5 August."

The eight was the last race held, and \"turned out to be surprisingly entertaining and competitive.\" The Romanians held a small lead over the Americans at the halfway mark, crossing at 1:29.28 to the United States' 1:29.62. But the Americans had a strong second half, breaking the finish line under the 3 minute mark—a feat which had not been accomplished before in Olympic history (the Soviets had come closest, with 3:00.19 in the first heat of the 1976 eight competition). The Romanians were not far behind, earning silver. There was also a closely contested race for the bronze medal between the Dutch and the Canadians; the former held off the latter. Great Britain started strong, running third at the halfway mark, before dropping back to fifth. West Germany came in sixth, over 5 seconds behind the Brits."

The 9 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 5 boats in one heat and 4 in the other. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the \"A\" final (1st through 6th place). The remaining 7 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured two heats, with 3 boats in one heat and 4 in the other. The top two boats in each of the repechage heats went to the \"A\" final. The remaining 3 boats (3rd and 4th placers in the repechage heats) competed in the \"B\" final for 7th through 9th place.\nAll races were over a 1000 metre course.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on July 30, during calm winds on a warm day (27 °C). The winner of each advanced to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nHeat 1.\nThere was little drama to this race. The Romanian boat rowed out to an early lead and was never challenged. The Dutch and Americans were close for second place at the halfway mark, but the Dutch pulled away over the second half. The Chinese boat (making the country's Olympic rowing debut) and the South Korean boat (making the country's second Olympic rowing appearance—South Korea had sent a men's eight in 1964) were well behind the other teams.\nHeat 2.\nWhile there was less distance between first and last in the second heat than the first, it was again not a race where any two boats were particularly close to each other. The Canadians won by over 3 seconds, the Australians took second by more than 4 seconds, and the West Germans finished third by over 1.5 seconds.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on August 1, during calm winds on a cooler day than the heats (16 °C vs. 27 °C). The top two boats in each of the two repechage heats advanced to the A final, with all others going to the B final, out of contention for medals.\nRepechage heat 1.\nThe Dutch team led early and finished with an easy win, more than 5 seconds ahead. In the competition for the second spot in the \"A\" final, China could not keep up with West Germany, falling behind by 2 seconds at the halfway mark and unable to close that gap over the last 500 metres.\nRepechage heat 2.\nThe second repechage heat was another race with little competitiveness. The Americans won by over 3 seconds, with more than 6 seconds separating second and third places.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final for 7th through 9th places was held on August 3. There was an east-northeast wind at 1.2 m/s on a fairly warm day (23 °C). Great Britain took an early lead of 2.5 seconds through the halfway mark. China, however, pushed them hard in the second half, narrowing the distance to only a half-second win by the British boat. South Korea, as was the case throughout the event, was outclassed by the other teams.\nFinal A.\nThe main final was held on August 4. The wind was calm again, and the day was cool (18 °C). The heat winners, Romania and Canada, had little difficulty taking gold and silver, respectively; Canada looked to challenge Romania for gold early but could not keep pace. The two teams that had advanced from the second repechage heat battled for the bronze medal, with the Australians winning a tight race with a \"last minute push.\" The Dutch team had actually been in third at the halfway mark before falling back to fifth. The West Germany boat kept close to the others early but eventually finished 5 seconds out of fifth place."

The 7 boats were divided into two heats for the first round, with 4 boats in one heat and 3 in the other. The winner of each heat advanced directly to the \"A\" final (1st through 6th place). The remaining 5 boats were placed in the repechage. A single heat was held in the repechage. The top four boats in the repechage went to the \"A\" final. The remaining boat (5th place in the repechage) was eliminated at 7th place overall.\nAll races were over a 1000-metre course. The women's quadruple sculls used a coxswain beginning with the 1976 Montreal Games. This was the last time that a coxswain was used.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe heats were held on July 30, during calm winds on a warm day (27 °C). The winner of each advanced to the A final, with all others going to the repechage. No boats were eliminated in this round.\nHeat 1.\nThe Romanian boat established a 2.5 second lead over the West Germans by the halfway mark and won easily. The French team moved past the Germans into second place over the second half, with the Canadians also (by only .02 seconds) overtaking West Germany.\nHeat 2.\nThe second heat resulted in an extremely close finish. The American boat had a half-second lead over the Danes at the halfway mark, but the Danish team closed the distance over the last 500 metres. The final margin for the United States was .01 seconds, allowing them to skip the repechage and go straight to the final, while Denmark went to race in the repechage. Italy was not competitive in this race, finishing 8 seconds after the other two boats.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on August 1. The winds were calm, though the day was cooler than during the heats (16 °C). Of the five boats in the repechage, all but one would advance to the final—only the last place boat would be eliminated (taking 7th place).\nThe West Germany boat started strong, holding nearly a full second lead at the halfway mark. Denmark, France, Italy, and Canada were roughly evenly spaced after that, with approximately half a second between each of those boats. Over the second half of the course, Denmark proved the best—passing West Germany to win by nearly 2 seconds. Canada was unable to gain ground on 4th-place Italy, and finished as the only boat not to reach the final.\nFinal.\nUnlike most other rowing events, the women's quadruple sculls had only a single final (with 7 boats in the event, a \"B\" final would have consisted of only a single team). The final was held on August 4, a cool (18 °C) day with no wind. West Germany again started strong, taking a lead of 1.2 seconds by the halfway mark, before falling back. Romania ultimately won relatively comfortably, beating the silver medalists by a second and a half. The description of the battle for second place in Sports-Reference indicates a very close finish (\"the United States and Denmark battled to the line for silver, with the former coming out ahead by another hair's breadth: 0.05 seconds\"), though this is not supported by the official times, which have the Americans winning by 0.45 seconds—a close race, but not nearly so close as the two had in the heats.\nThe third through sixth place teams finished in the same order as they had in the repechage, with Denmark taking the bronze followed by West Germany, France, and Italy."

The British boat was only half a second behind the Dutch team after 500 metres before falling back to 9 seconds out of third place at the end.\nHeat 2.\nThe race was held during calm winds. At the halfway mark, the Norwegians held a 1.33 second lead over the Swedes. The Austrians and Americans were further back, with Austria holding a very slight lead for third place. Over the second half of the course, the Swedes pulled closer but were unable to catch the Norwegians. The Austrians fell back to fourth place, finishing nearly 6 seconds after the Americans.\nRepechage.\nThe repechage was held on August 1. The race was held during calm winds. The temperature was significantly cooler than during the heats (16 °C vs. 27 °C). By the halfway mark, the boats had separated into two groups, with the Canadians leading the Dutch and Swedes in the lead group while the Americans led the Brits and Austrians in the second group. The results of the second group were more important, as the top 4 boats advanced to the main final; the Americans pulled closer to the lead group while the British and Austrian boats fell further behind. The Dutch pair had the best second-half, taking the lead while the Canadians fell from first to third.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe \"B\" final was held on August 3. It featured the last two boats from the repechage, facing off for 7th and 8th place. There was an east-northeast wind at 1.2 m/s, and the weather was warmer again (23 °C). The British boat led by half a second at the halfway mark, but the Austrians had a strong second half to win by nearly 4 seconds.\nFinal A.\nThe \"A\" final was held on August 4, with calm winds but cooler temperatures (18 °C). The Romanians established a 1-second lead by halfway, increasing to a final margin of victory of nearly 2.4 seconds. The next three boats were closer than that but still relatively separated, with the Canadians taking bronze at 0.7 seconds behind the Dutch silver medalists and the Swedes in fourth at 1 second after that. The Norwegian boat, despite winning its heat, found itself in a tight race for 5th and 6th place against the Americans, beating them by only a quarter-second."

His positions of choice were centre three-quarter and second five-eighth. Roberts did not play in any test matches as New Zealand did not play their first until 1903.\nEarly years.\nRoberts was born in the Lower Hutt suburb of Taitā. He was known by the nickname \"Cocky\".\nHe was educated at Mount Cook School, Wellington.\nPlaying career.\nRoberts played for three clubs in total, during a career which spanned more than a decade.\nHe made his provincial debut for Wellington as a 17-year-old.\nIn 1896, Roberts played in the game for Wellington against the touring Queensland team. This game was won 49–7 and Roberts scored three tries.\nRoberts was then selected for the national side, in what was named an \"unofficial\" test against the Queensland visitors. This game was won 9–0.\nThe next year, he played in the 1897 North against South Island match. He played an outstanding game and it was shock that he was not chosen immediately to tour Australia. However, he was later called into the squad as an injury replacement.\nHe played the last six tour matches and this included scoring three tries in the second fixture against New South Wales.\nAfter the tour the team played the Auckland provincial side when they returned to New Zealand. The All Blacks lost 11–10. During the post-match gathering, Roberts and teammate Joe Calnan were suspended from playing any level of rugby for two seasons due to inappropriate behaviour.\nHe never appeared for the national side again but continued playing club and provincial rugby until 1903."

Coach Skip Guinto's determined Bulldogs battered and tore their way to gain the crown in the expense of the Tamaraws of Far Eastern U by the low final count of 41-36.\nThe two standouts of the league made it a rare rip-roaring finish for some 9,000 fans at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum. They battled it out tensely all the way, and the issue was up in the air until the closing minutes of play.\nIn the brilliant finish, Bulldogs Antonio Villamor and A. de Jesus accounted for the difference. The two veteran Nationals broke the defense of the opposition with neat interceptions and timely shots to pull their team out of the fire and clinch the thrilling ball game.\nIt was a Tamaraw show for fully three quarters of play. In the final 10 minutes, the driving and battering game of the Bulldogs paid off. Villamor and De Jesus tied the count at 31-all and at 32-all. Then, with only five minutes to go, De Jesus scored a series of four free shots to give the Nats their first real lead which maintained to the end."

He made his debut for Bristol in their 40–7 defeat against Sale Sharks on 29 August 2020.\nIn November 2020 it was confirmed he had signed a one-year contract extension for the 2020–21 season."

        "title": "Overwatch League",
        "text": "The Overwatch League (OWL) was a professional esports league for the video game \"Overwatch\", produced by its developer, Blizzard Entertainment. From 2018 to 2023, the Overwatch League followed the model of other traditional North American professional sporting leagues by using a set of permanent, city-based teams backed by separate ownership groups. The league used the regular season and playoffs format rather than promotion and relegation used commonly in other esports and non-North American leagues, with players on the roster being assured a minimum annual salary, benefits, and a portion of winnings and revenue-sharing based on team performance.\nThe Overwatch League was announced in 2016 and secured commitments from 12 teams across the United States, Europe, and Asia, each investing $20million in franchise fees, to participate in its 2018 inaugural season. The league faced skeptics who questioned its potential success due to the lack of a proven concept and a game without a substantial esports history. For the following season, the Overwatch League brought in eight new franchises, each investing between$35 million to $60million.\nIn 2020, the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread disruptions and forced the league abandon its original homestand model and shift to an online format, where teams competed remotely from their respective regions. While the suspension of in-person events provided a temporary solution, it also raised concerns about its financial viability. However, some team owners noted that not having live events allowed them to mitigate financial losses that they would have otherwise incurred. During the 2021 season, in the wake of a lawsuit filed against Activision Blizzard, nearly all of the league's sponsors withdrew their support from the league.\nIn November 2022, a broken partnership with NetEase and Blizzard resulted in \"Overwatch 2\" being banned in China. As a result, the league allowed Overwatch Contenders teams to compete in its Eastern Region for the following season, and the league saw its first team leave, as the Chengdu Hunters dissolved. In January 2023, Overwatch League teams collectively initiated a collective bargaining process, which resulted in the Overwatch League agreeing to waive all outstanding franchise fees. By November 2023, Blizzard had announced that Overwatch esports was \"transitioning\" from the Overwatch League into a more traditional esports structure for the title, which would become the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) in 2024.\nFormat.\nThe Overwatch League was owned by Blizzard Entertainment and run by Major League Gaming, which is also owned by Blizzard's parent company Activision Blizzard. The Overwatch League played out similar to most North American professional sports leagues, in which all teams played scheduled games against other teams to vie for position in the season's playoffs, rather than the approach of team promotion and relegation more commonly used in other esports leagues. The league featured twenty teams split between two conferences based on their location: East and West. The East had eight teams, while the West had twelve.\nThe 2018 season consisted of non-regulation pre-season play, a regular season divided into four stages, and a post-season playoffs tournament to determine the championship team for the season. Each regular season stage lasted five weeks, with each stage ending with a short playoff of the top teams based on that stage's records to determine stage champions. Teams played 40 matches across the regular season, playing teams both within and outside their division. The post-season playoffs used teams' overall standings across all stages. The top standing team in both divisions received the top two seed in the playoffs, followed by a fixed number of teams determined from across both divisions. An All-Star weekend is also held, featuring two division-based teams selected by league representatives and voted on by fans.\nThe 2019 season format was similar to that of the previous season, though stage playoffs for the fourth stage were eliminated and the number of matches was decreased to 28, among other changes. The 2020 season introduced a number of changes, including a home-and-away format, where each team would host home games with up to eight teams per homestand event, and the elimination of the stage format. This format was eventually changed to a bimonthly tournament-based season in April due to the global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTeams are awarded with monetary prizes for how they place at the end of the regular season, as well as for participating and placing high in the stage playoffs and post-season tournament. For example, the first season had a total prize pool of available, with the top prize of $1 million awarded to the post-season championship team.\nRules.\n\"Overwatch\" is a five-versus-five team-based first-person shooter video game. Broadly, the goal is to work with team members to eliminate or repel opponents while attacking, defending, or competing for an objective. Players select from the game's roster of thirty-three heroes, split between classes of Damage (the main attackers), Support (providing healing and other buffs), and Tank (shielding teammates with high health amounts) each with their own pre-designed set of weapons and skill kits, though each player on a team must play a unique hero. Starting with stage four of the 2019 season, each team must be composed of two Damage heroes, two Supports, and two Tanks. A player can switch to an available hero within the same class if they are eliminated prior to respawning, or if they return to their current spawn point, which allows for teams to adjust their composition dynamically based on the current situation.\nWithin league play, a regular season match featured two teams (one selected as the home team, the other as the visiting team) playing a best-of-five format, with each map featuring a predetermined map type, following the same gameplay format as with normal competitive mode in \"Overwatch\": Control maps, played on a best-of-three rounds, and Assault, Escort, and Hybrid maps, with each team having at least one chance as the attacking team. The pool of specific maps from the standard \"Overwatch\" rotation were determined periodically, allowing the teams to determine their player lineups and strategy while also changing the season's metagame. A team may have called in substitutes for players only between maps. The team that won three maps first won the match. If teams are tied after four games, a tiebreaker game played on a Control map (which cannot end in a tie) was used to break the tie and determine the match winner. Standings were based primarily on the overall match win–loss record, but ties were broken based on the total map win–loss record. Any further ties for tournament placement were broken based first on the head-to-head game win–loss record, then head-to-head match count.\nOverwatch League games were played on a custom server controlled by Blizzard; this server is also available to players for practices. This version of the game received similar updates to the main commercial game, adding new maps and heroes, and altering the various hero abilities based on testing within the Public Test Realm. However, these updates were not applied immediately as they are for the commercial game, but instead no more frequent than once every six weeks. For example, a late January 2018 patch, which had significant effects on characters like Mercy and thus had potential to upset the metagame, was not applied to the league server until mid-February, at the start of the second stage. However, teams were given access to private servers updated to alongside the main release of \"Overwatch\" for them to practice and scrimmage against other teams to learn and develop strategies on updates and patches before experiencing them in official matches. For matches, each player was provided with an identical desktop computer, monitor, and pair of noise-cancelling headphones to play on to eliminate any handicaps related to computational or graphics processing, but players may have used their preferred keyboard and mouse.\nPlayer eligibility and benefits.\nWhile \"Overwatch\" is played in teams of five, Overwatch League teams could have had up to six additional players that could be swapped between maps. A team's membership was locked at the start of the season, but a mid-season signing period allowed teams to bring in new players or trade players between teams. Following the end of the season, teams had about one month to extend current player contracts, bring on players from affiliated Overwatch Contenders teams, or hold private tryout sessions. Subsequently, all unsigned players by the end of this period entered free agency during which players could negotiate with teams to become part of the roster; in the case of when expansion teams were added, there was a month-long period where expansion teams had exclusive negotiating rights before other teams can engage. A team's minimum roster was to be set prior to the season's pre-season matches, about two months prior to season play, but they could expand and change this roster up until a specified date. The league was not region-locked, so teams could use players of any nationality to fill their ranks, as long as the team ownership was based in that city or region. For example, the London Spitfire at the onset of the first season was entirely made up of South Korean players. The only restriction on players is to be of at least 17 years old and to be able to travel internationally.\nOverwatch League players, while on a team's contract, were paid an annual salary. As of the 2023 season, a player's salary was a minimum of set by the league. Additionally, the league offered players with health and retirement benefits, as well as housing and training support. Blizzard required team owners to provide the signed players with bonuses representing at least 50% of the team's winnings and revenue. Players could negotiate for larger amounts with their team's owners and larger portion of the bonus revenue-sharing from tournament winnings and other income. For example, in 2017, Jay \"sinatraa\" Won secured the league's highest salary of $150,000 for his spot on the San Francisco Shock, along with a 50% share of the team's bonuses.\nPlayers were expected to follow a code of conduct set by Blizzard while playing and representing the league, and may have face suspension and fines for violating these, in addition to any penalties the team itself may impose. A noted incident shortly after the league's launch saw Dallas Fuel's Félix \"xQc\" Lengyel suspended by the league for four games and fined $2,000 for making homophobic comments about another player; the Fuel further suspended him for the remainder of the first stage of play. Following additional conduct violations in the second stage that led to further suspension, xQc was released by the Fuel. Blizzard has since started its online \"discipline tracker\" in December 2018 to list players who have been temporarily suspended or fined for actions related to their behavior as representatives of the Overwatch League. Players, as part of their benefits, received media training to help with speaking to the press and public about their roles, an issue that has been a problem in previous organized esport systems.\nOpen Division and Contenders.\nProfessional teams in the league were given the opportunity to scout for new players through two additional competitive leagues run by Blizzard. The Open Division, first started in June 2017, allowed amateur teams to compete against each other in a structured season. Those that qualify at the end of the season were seeded into a post-season tournament with intra-regional matches. Players that complete all non-playoff games for their team could earn a small amount of credit to Blizzard's digital storefront, while regional winning teams could earn higher prize payouts. The Open division was played across seven different regions: Australia, China, Europe, Korea, North America, Pacific, and South America.\nPlayers or teams can then move up from the Open Division into Overwatch Contenders, which was a minor league to the Overwatch League. Contenders was launched in 2018 to merge existing regional tournaments into a structure to support the Overwatch League. Contenders consisted of several global divisions with a number of teams within each, which may include both professional and amateur players. Contender teams may have been affiliated with an Overwatch League team as an academy team, and up to two players per academy team could be signed to two-way contracts to be moved between their academy team and Overwatch League team.\nContenders was launched in the first half of 2018 with five divisions with 12 teams each: Korea (replacing the Overwatch Apex tournament), China (replacing the Overwatch Premier Series), and Pacific (replacing Overwatch Pacific Championship for other Asian-Pacific countries), and adding in North America and European divisions. Prior to the second 2018 Contenders season, Blizzard added two additional divisions, for Australia and South America, bringing the total to seven. The top eight teams from the Open Division within each region are also invited to Contenders Trials, a weekly promotion and relegation tournament to compete in the following week of Contenders. For its second season in 2019, Blizzard adjusted the format by reducing the number of teams in each region to eight, while dividing the North American region into East and West divisions. Blizzard also added a regional limit of the number of \"import players\", which are those that live outside the division's region, to a maximum of three. These changes were reverted for the 2020 season.\nHistory.\nConcept.\nThe development of \"Overwatch\" began in approximately 2013, coinciding with the rising popularity of esports and spectator-driven video gaming, fueled by the accessibility of live streaming platforms. However, the game's development was not dedicated to esports. Lead director Jeff Kaplan, based on Blizzard's past experiences with esports, emphasized the importance of avoiding excessive commitment to esports too early in the game's lifespan. Instead, they chose to closely observe the player community and incorporate any esports-related goals based on their observations. During the beta period of \"Overwatch\", which lasted from late 2015 to mid-2016, Blizzard observed that players were organizing \"ad hoc\" competitions and tournaments for the game. This led to Blizzard's consideration of the potential impact if they took charge of formalizing and structuring these competitions. Nate Nanzer, who later became the league's commissioner, noted that with the right approach and investment, they could monetize esports in a manner comparable to traditional sports. Building on this insight, Blizzard laid the groundwork for what would eventually become the Overwatch League. Part of this included introducing competitive features directly into the main \"Overwatch\" game, such as ranked play, allowing players to climb a rankings ladder and attract the attention of esports team organizers. In October 2016, Bobby Kotick, the CEO of Activision Blizzard, the parent company of Blizzard, first publicly mentioned the Overwatch League. Kotick highlighted the viewership of user-generated esports content, which had already reached around 100million, surpassing the viewership of some professional NFL and NBA games. Recognizing this potential, Kotick envisioned the Overwatch League as a means to deliver \"professional content\" and tap into this extensive viewership.\nThe Overwatch League was formally announced at BlizzCon in November 2016. During the announcement, Blizzard revealed their plans for the league, which would feature franchised teams employing players to compete in both live arenas and via video streaming platforms. These teams would provide players with salaries, benefits, and opportunities for team and player development. Blizzard's approach to the league differed from traditional esports models that used relegation and promotion systems, such as the one employed in the \"League of Legends\" Championship Series. Instead, they opted to follow the American model prevalent in more traditional physical sports. Kotick expressed his belief that the Overwatch League represented an unprecedented venture in esports, emphasizing that nothing of this scale had been attempted before. He also emphasized the importance of adopting a model similar to the NFL in terms of league structure and financial opportunities to attract substantial investments and establish long-lasting franchises within the Overwatch League. He described this approach as a \"forever investment\".\nBlizzard aimed to cover the costs of running the league through traditional revenue streams commonly seen in professional sports leagues, including promotion, advertisements, and physical merchandise. Additionally, owing to the digital nature of esports, Kotick said that they had the opportunity to generate revenue from virtual league-based items offered to fans, as well as increased sales of \"Overwatch\" and other games. He also expressed that they could explore more lucrative \"over-the-top advertising opportunities that wouldn't exist in traditional sports\". Kotick expressed confidence in the league's future financial success. While certain revenue streams might take time to fully materialize, he noted significant traction and enthusiasm from fans before the inaugural season began.\nBuildout.\nBlizzard sought out potential team owners, with a focus on establishing localized teams tied to specific geographic areas. The company believed that having such local teams would generate greater interest in esports among spectators and potential sponsors, as it would create new opportunities for fans to engage and support their hometown teams. A meeting for prospective team owners took place at BlizzCon 2016, shortly after the league's official announcement. Notable attendees included Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, and Stan Kroenke, the owner of the Los Angeles Rams. During the formative stages of the league, Blizzard appointed Steve Bornstein as the company's esports chair. Bornstein, formerly the president of ABC Sports and CEO of NFL Network, assumed a role in shaping the broadcast and presentation of Overwatch League games.\nBlizzard anticipated the Overwatch League would have a seven-figure payoff for the winning team at the end of a season. The inaugural season of the league, which was initially intended to be a shortened one, was planned to start in Q3 2017. Subsequent full-length seasons were scheduled to commence in 2018, with the league incorporating half-year long seasonal breaks beginning in Q4 of that year. Prior to the league's official start, Blizzard planned to host a combine, during which players would be invited to try out for guaranteed team contracts.\nAfter the initial announcement in November 2016, Blizzard remained tight-lipped about the Overwatch League for several months, leading to some speculation that the league might be encountering challenges. In May 2017, \"ESPN\" reported that the league was indeed facing difficulties in securing franchise deals and attributed these issues to two primary factors. Firstly, the high base cost of starting a franchise, which began at $20million and could be even higher in more urban markets like New York City and Los Angeles, presented a significant barrier. This entry fee was substantially higher compared to buy-ins for other esports leagues. Secondly, another obstacle was the absence of revenue sharing until 2021. This meant that potential franchise owners could face difficulties in recovering their initial investment costs. However, during this time, Activision Blizzard was actively engaging with potential team owners, opting to withhold extensive announcements until they could present comprehensive details.\nThe Kraft Group, headed by Robert Kraft, emerged as a key team owner for the league. Kraft had shown previous interest in investing in esports and had met with Bobby Kotick in 2013 when Kotick was exploring investment opportunities in an NFL franchise. During that meeting, Kraft revealed their intent to seek investment in an esports team. Over the next few years, Kraft evaluated various esports competitions but was not entirely comfortable with their grassroots nature. However, when Blizzard introduced the Overwatch League during BlizzCon 2016, it captured Kraft's attention. By March 2017, a deal was successfully struck between Kraft and Activision, securing the first team ownership group for the Overwatch League. Once the Kraft Group committed to supporting a Boston-based team, later named the Boston Uprising, this acted as a catalyst, leading to the formation of six additional teams in the league. The Kraft Group themselves helped to convince some of the other owners to buy into the Overwatch League.\nIn July 2017, Blizzard revealed the first seven teams and their respective owners for the Overwatch League. Over the following months, additional teams were announced, eventually finalizing a total of twelve teams by mid-December.\nIn September 2017, Blizzard announced that they would make permanent use of Studio 1 at The Burbank Studios in Burbank, California, and would convert it into the \"Blizzard Arena\". Having a dedicated arena served several purposes. Firstly, it aimed to elevate the status of the Overwatch League, presenting it as a highly orchestrated event distinct from other esports tournaments. Additionally, the Blizzard Arena provided an opportunity for players to build stronger connections with their fanbase. Blizzard conducted Overwatch Contenders events in the Blizzard Arena in October 2017. This allowed them to identify areas for improvement and make necessary adjustments ahead of the Overwatch League pre-season, which commenced in December 2017.\nLaunch and expansion.\nTo support spectating on broadcast and streaming media, Blizzard implemented cosmetic modifications to the game. Each team received dedicated character skins featuring their team colors, names, and logos. These customized skins were used during matches to easily identify and represent their respective teams. To allow fans outside of the league to show their support, Blizzard introduced a special in-game currency called \"OWL Tokens\". Players could purchase a character's team skin using OWL Tokens. A percentage of the revenue generated from these purchases was allocated to the teams themselves, providing them with additional financial support. Initially, OWL Tokens were obtainable through an in-game purchase with real currency. However, during the first season, viewers could receive tokens by watching the live broadcast of games through any official Overwatch League channel.\nBlizzard also worked to create an AI-based cameraman, capable of following the action of the game and selecting key instant replays. During regular season matches, Blizzard employed a team of approximately 80 to 100 people to manage the game and its broadcast. This team included on-screen hosts, interviewers, play-by-play announcers or \"shoutcasters\", broadcasting and technical support personnel, and \"observers\" who used the AI cameraman to monitor matches from various angles. Additionally, there were broadcasting and technical support personnel involved in the production. For broadcasting and commentary, Blizzard enlisted individuals such as Christopher \"MonteCristo\" Mykles, Erik \"DoA\" Lonnquist, Matt \"Mr. X\" Morello, and Mitchell \"Uber\" Leslie to shoutcast the matches. Blizzard released an Overwatch League app in early January 2018, just before the first season commenced. The app provided schedules, results, highlights, and other essential details about the league's progress.\nPreseason play for the inaugural season of the Overwatch League commenced on December 6, 2017. The first regular season game took place on January 10, 2018, with the Los Angeles Valiant defeating the San Francisco Shock. The initial night of play through the English broadcast on Twitch garnered over 415,000 viewers, while never dropping below 285,000 once play started. Blizzard reported that during the first week, over 10million viewers watched league play across all streaming platforms, and the Blizzard Arena was sold-out throughout the entire week. However, by the end of the season, the league faced challenges in filling seats at Blizzard Arena. According to a former esports executive, it was not uncommon to have only around 100 people in the audience. To address this issue, the company resorted to busing in employees or distributing free tickets to students when high-profile individuals like Kotick or other VIPs were expected to attend. However, this approach was seen as incentivizing undesirable behavior, as it artificially inflated attendance numbers to impress potential team owners and sell them on the promise of a thriving live audience.\nAs the postseason began, Blizzard and Disney signed a deal to air postseason games on ABC, ESPN, and Disney XD alongside the official Twitch streams, with the partnership extending into the second season. During its first season, the league secured over $200million in sponsorships and broadcast rights. Major sponsors included Intel, Omen by HP, Toyota, T-Mobile, and Spotify, with most deals valued at over $10million each. The league ultimately exceeded its 2018 projected revenue of $22million.\nThe London Spitfire became the first champions of Overwatch League after defeating the Philadelphia Fusion in the Grand Finals, which took place before 22,000 fans at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, New York on July 27–28. The finals were watched by more than 10.8million people, with a viewership comparable to regular season NFL games.\nIn March 2018, Overwatch League executives began to search for new expansion teams, particularly in international markets, as only one team, the Shanghai Dragons were owned by a foreign corporation at the time. Despite initial skepticism and doubts about the league's potential, Overwatch League's revenue had already exceeded expectations, reaching almost four times its original projection from December 2017 to February 2018. The franchise fee for expansion teams was expected to be higher than the inaugural season, estimated to be between $35million to $60million. In September 2018, Blizzard announced the addition of eight new teams for the second season: the Atlanta Reign, Guangzhou Charge, Hangzhou Spark, Toronto Defiant, Paris Eternal, Washington Justice, Vancouver Titans, and Chengdu Hunters. This brought the total number of teams in the league to 20.\nFor the second season, the regular season was split into four stages, and each team played a total of 28 games, with seven games per stage. This reduced the number of games from 40, which was played in the first season, addressing concerns related to player fatigue and mental health. Most regular season games were played at the Blizzard Arena in Los Angeles, but select Homestand Weekends matches took place at locations in Dallas, Atlanta, and Los Angeles, testing the feasibility of home-and-away games for the following season. \nIn May 2019, during the middle of the season, league commissioner Nate Nanzer announced that he would be leaving Blizzard to join Epic Games. Pete Vlastelica, who was the CEO and president of Activision Blizzard Esports, took over as the league commissioner following Nanzer's departure. The following month, Immortals Gaming Club (IGC), the parent company of the Los Angeles Valiant, acquired Infinite Esports, the parent company of Houston Outlaws, marking the first sale of any Overwatch League franchise. Since one company may not own more than one OWL franchise, IGC sold the Outlaws to the Beasley Media Group in November 2019.\nBeginning in the second season, Fanatics became the league's outfitter, responsible for producing and selling team- and OWL-related clothing and merchandise. Blizzard also signed a multi-year deal with Coca-Cola to become the official non-alcoholic beverage sponsor for various \"Overwatch\" esports events, including the Overwatch League, Overwatch Contenders, Open Division, Overwatch World Cup, and BlizzCon. Bud Light became the league's alcoholic beverage sponsor, excluding in China. Furthermore, Xfinity signed on as a sponsor for the 2019 Overwatch League playoffs and Grand Finals. Throughout the second season, the overall global viewership was estimated at 218,000 per minute on average across all games, with a majority of viewers coming from outside the United States.\nTransition to online play.\nAhead of the 2020 season, Blizzard signed a three-year deal with YouTube to be the exclusive broadcaster of the Overwatch League. This agreement replaced Twitch as the primary streaming platform for the league's matches. As part of the arrangement, Blizzard also established Google Cloud Platform as the preferred infrastructure provider for the game servers.\nIn the third season of the Overwatch League, significant changes were made to fully adopt the away-and-home format, allowing games to take place in home arenas for each team. The home arenas were not required to be dedicated esports venues, and some teams collaborated with their local cities to develop such spaces that could also host other sports and entertainment events. For instance, the Philadelphia Fusion's owner, Comcast Spectacor, announced plans to construct the $50million Fusion Arena by the 2021 season, but during the 2020 season, they scheduled homestand games at the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia and Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City. Throughout the 2020 season, there were 52 homestand events planned, with each team hosting at least two in their home arenas. Teams that already secured larger arenas were set to host additional regular season events to support the newer teams and arenas in becoming better established. For example, Dallas, Washington, and Guangzhou each had five homestand events scheduled.\nThe initial schedules were managed by the teams, but Blizzard anticipated taking over scheduling for the 2021 season. Blizzard provided flexibility for teams to plan the 2020 schedule and develop logistics for hosting homestand events, including providing accommodations and practice areas for visiting teams during those weekends. This expansion was coordinated with the Call of Duty League (CDL), a professional esports league founded by Activision in 2020, which also followed the city-based model with many teams owned by the same entities as OWL teams. Both leagues faced similar logistics challenges and coordinated efforts when applicable. Moreover, the previously established divisions were converted into conferences, with each conference having two divisions. The stages were eliminated, and teams continued to play 28 games throughout the season with a planned mid-season All-Star break. Looking forward, League Commissioner Pete Vlastelica expressed interest in potential expansion of the league, with a primary focus on introducing more teams from Europe.\nDue to the restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league had to suspend all homestand events and transitioned to online play just a month into the 2020 season. Blizzard Entertainment announced its intention to return to the homestand format as soon as it was safe and logistically feasible. With the closure of entertainment venues in Los Angeles, the Overwatch League production team, including casters and analysts, moved to remote setups, with everyone working from home for the remainder of the season. As part of the adaptation to the new circumstances, the league abandoned the original conferences and instead organized teams into two regions to account for their geographical locations. Teams exclusively competed within their respective regions during the regular season, and inter-regional matches only occurred at the end of the playoffs period. Additionally, the 2020 season introduced mid-season tournaments, held three times throughout the regular season, all still split by region.\nAccording to two owners, the pandemic had an unexpected positive impact on teams as it halted the financial losses incurred from live events. However, the suspension of in-person games also challenged the league's original justification for its existence, leading some teams to contemplate not paying franchise fees in 2020. Two individuals familiar with the situation revealed that Activision Blizzard permitted teams to postpone the fees and provided a $2million payroll credit. As part of the agreement, teams were required to sign a release stating they would not pursue legal action against the company, as reported by two other sources.\nAt the end of the 2020 season, commissioner Pete Vlastelica stepped down to take on a new position. He was replaced by Johanna Faries, the commissioner of the Call of Duty League, who became the commissioner of both leagues.\nDuring the fourth season of the Overwatch League, the league continued to adopt regional, online play due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, some live events were initially planned to take place in China. The OWL expanded on its tournament format from the previous year, introducing four midseason tournaments throughout the regular season. In July 2021, the league announced that it would host its two postseason events live at different venues: the playoffs would be held at the Esports Stadium Arlington in Arlington, Texas, and the 2021 Grand Finals would take place at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California. However, due to increasing risks related to COVID-19 and the Delta variant, as well as visa difficulties, these live events were later canceled and shifted to online play. During the season, the OWL also faced sponsor pullbacks, with many of its partners withdrawing their sponsorships following a lawsuit filed by the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) against Activision Blizzard for sexual harassment and discrimination within the company. Sponsors, such as Coca-Cola, Kellogg's, State Farm, and T-Mobile, withdrew their support from the league. By mid-August 2021, the only sponsor present during Overwatch League broadcasts was voice-over-Internet Protocol software company TeamSpeak.\n\"Overwatch 2\" era.\nFor the fifth season of the OWL, the league played on an early release of \"Overwatch 2\". The season, which began in early May 2022, faced several challenges on multiple fronts. Notably, there were no known sponsors for the season as of June 9, 2022. Moreover, the league underwent significant changes in its leadership during this time, as five top executives left Activision Blizzard Esports or transitioned to other departments since the start of the season. Furthermore, the company made adjustments to its operations, deciding to outsource its broadcast and event production to a third party. During the midseason tournaments, viewership numbers experienced a significant decrease compared to the previous season, with a reduction of up to 40.5%. However, after the official release of \"Overwatch 2\" on October 5, 2022, the league saw a surge in viewership. The 2022 playoffs reached an live average minute audience of 250,000, surpassing previous viewership records from when the league was broadcast on Twitch in 2018 and 2019. The 2022 Grand Finals were held live at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, marking the first time that the Grand Finals were held live since 2019. In terms of sponsorships, the league secured a deal with Butterfinger for the playoffs, marking their first new sponsorship since 2021.\nDuring the offseason leading up to the 2023 season, the league faced challenges with uncertainties about its future, as broken partnership with NetEase caused disruptions in the East Region as certain Blizzard games, including \"Overwatch 2\", were banned in China. To adapt to this, in the East Region, an \"open ecosystem\" approach was implemented, allowing Overwatch Contenders teams to compete alongside Overwatch League teams. A preseason pro-am tournament was also held in the West Region, where Overwatch Contenders teams competed against established OWL teams. The regular season was divided into two stages, Spring and Summer, and featured only one midseason tournament. Several teams underwent significant changes in branding and regions during this offseason as well. The Paris Eternal relocated to Las Vegas and rebranded as the Vegas Eternal, making them the first team in the league to switch cities. Similarly, the Philadelphia Fusion shifted their base to Seoul and adopted a new identity as the Seoul Infernal. Not all teams remained intact, as the Chengdu Hunters disbanded.\nIn January 2023, in an effort to address operating costs and viewership challenges, Overwatch League teams collectively initiated a bargaining process. They enlisted the representation of Sheridans, a British law firm, to negotiate with Activision Blizzard. This collective bargaining process led to an agreement between OverActive Media, the owner of the Toronto Defiant, and the Overwatch League. As part of this agreement, the Toronto Defiant signed a sponsorship deal with the league, and the Overwatch League agreed to waive the outstanding franchise fees owed by all teams.\nTermination.\nOn July 19, 2023, Activision-Blizzard released its second-quarter earnings report. According to the report, following the conclusion of the 2023 season, franchise owners voted on an updated operating agreement. Should the teams opt not to continue under the updated agreement, a termination fee of $6million would be payable to each participating team entity, amounting to a total fee of approximately $114million. On November 8, 2023, an OWL spokesperson confirmed that Blizzard would be transitioning away from its current model and would be working on building a new framework for competitive \"Overwatch\", as a two-thirds majority of OWL franchisees voted to depart from the league. Reports suggested that the league might be operated by a third-party tournament organizer in 2024. On January 23, 2024, Blizzard announced that the Overwatch League was officially folded; on the same day, they announced a multi-year deal with ESL FACEIT Group and WDG Esports to create the Overwatch Champions Series (OWCS) to replace the OWL.\nTeams.\nThe league launched in 2018 with twelve teams, each based in a global city. Eight additional teams were added in the league's 2019 season. Prior to the 2020 season, the teams were divided between two divisions: the Atlantic Division with the American East Coast, Eastern Canadian and European teams, and the Pacific Division with the American West Coast, Western Canadian and Asian teams. With the 2020 season, the two divisions were elevated to conferences, keeping the same team distributions, but with now two divisions within each conference. Additionally, teams began playing in home/away games, with each team having one or more venues to host homestand weekends. However, due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, all live matches were cancelled near the beginning of the 2020 season, and teams were divided into regions. Below was the region split as of the 2023 season.\nLeague championships.\nAs of the 2023 season, 20 different teams have competed in the league, with five having won at least one Grand Finals title.\nBroadcasting.\nShortly prior to the beginning of the 2018 regular season, Blizzard reached a two-year deal with Twitch to be the main streaming broadcaster of the Overwatch League outside of China, reported to be valued at $90million. The service carried streams in English, French, and Korean, while users who linked their Twitch account to their Battle.net account would also be eligible for chances to receive in-game items for \"Overwatch\" while watching broadcasts. A subscription service known as the \"All-Access Pass\" also allowed users access to private streams and chat rooms with players, coaches, league officials and announcers, in-game currency to purchase team skins, emotes for use on Twitch chats, and discounts at Blizzard's store. This feature was expanded for the 2019 season to include the ability for viewers to use the \"command center\" app introduced during the 2018 Overwatch World Cup, to be able to view matches from different camera angles in real-time. The league also posted highlights on Twitter starting with the first season's All-Star Weekend and continuing into the second season, and also produced a weekly pre-game show called \"Watchpoint\".\nOn July 11, 2018, Blizzard also announced a U.S. television deal with ESPN through the 2019 season, under which coverage of the 2018 playoffs would be simulcast across ESPN networks, including the semi-finals airing across ESPN2, ESPNews, and Disney–ABC Television Group sister channel Disney XD, the first night of the final airing on the main ESPN network (marking its first-ever primetime broadcast of an esports event), continuing on Disney XD the next day, and a highlights package the following Sunday on ABC. The arrangement continued into the 2019 season, with Disney XD adding regular-season broadcasts, and ABC adding broadcast television simulcasts of the Stage 1 and Stage 2 finals, and the all-star event. This partnership included broadcasting rights to the Overwatch World Cup as well. ESPN's sister Canadian network TSN also carried broadcasts on its platforms, including television encores of matches involving the league's new Canadian franchises.\nGerman sports channel Sport1, which broadcasts to Switzerland and Austria in addition to Germany, made a two-year deal with Blizzard games live starting in the second season, partnering to form a new eSports1 sister channel.\nIn early 2020, YouTube reached a three-year exclusive deal to serve as broadcaster for all Activision Blizzard esports events, including the Overwatch League, Call of Duty League, and \"Hearthstone\", replacing Twitch. The deal was reported to be valued at $160million. Alongside the agreement, Activision Blizzard also reached an agreement to use Google Cloud Platform as its preferred infrastructure provider for its game servers. After the expiration of the deal, the Overwatch League season would continue to be exclusively broadcast on YouTube.\nReception.\nSome commentators observed that of the more than 100 players selected for teams for the first season, none of them were female. Some noted the absence of Kim \"Geguri\" Se-yeon, a teenage South Korean player who is recognized as one of the highest-skilled Zarya players and who was the first female player to play in the Overwatch APEX league. During the press day event prior to the start of the season, teams acknowledged they had considered signing on Geguri but noted issues with such an action. The Houston Outlaws said that there would have been a language barrier issue with her potential teammates, and complications related to co-ed housing for teams. The team also claimed that if they had brought her on board, there would have been issues from external commentators about whether it was a press stunt or an otherwise legitimate reason, and the nature of this legitimacy would shadow her career. Other teams like the London Spitfire and the New York Excelsior had looked to Geguri as a free agent but in the end desired to work from an established set of players that had already worked in leagues in the past. Team owners recognized that they want to make the player roster more diverse, but this in part requires making the community around \"Overwatch\" less toxic and more inviting. Nanzer also said he would like to see further diversity in players in the league, but was aware that there are cultures where there is a social stigma against professional video game players that can be a barrier to achieve this. By mid-February, during the Season 1 free agency window, Geguri was signed by the Shanghai Dragons, making her the first female player in the league.\nAdditional concerns were raised following several league-issued fines and suspensions issued against a number of players based on their conduct. Journalists found that some players carried over the toxic nature from their days as YouTube or Twitch broadcasters, in which players would often routinely ridicule their opponents; many of the fines and suspensions follow from similar behavior displayed at the league level. The \"Overwatch\" player base outside of the league has also had issues of toxicity, which Blizzard has been trying to handle through better reporting tools. In addition to requiring the league players to follow the code of conduct, Blizzard is also watching how these players behave on off-league broadcasts, and would fine players if they engage in toxic or inappropriate behavior even if not part of a league session, as well as publicizing when the league takes such actions. Some of this poor behavior had concerned at least one of the league's sponsors, HP, since the behavior becomes associated with their brand, though such problems were not unique to esports, according to HP product manager John Ludwig.\nAfter the conclusion of the first stage of the inaugural season, ESPN reported that the revenue projections for the league has exceeded its expectations, with some insiders claiming that the league's revenue was four times greater than initially planned; this was in part through its Twitch streaming deal and new advertisers, such as Toyota and T-Mobile, that came on board a few weeks into play. Due to the success of the first season of the Overwatch League, \"Fortune\" named commissioner Nate Nanzer as one of their \"40 Under 40\" in 2018.\nEntering the third season, concern had been raised on the stress of the league on its players. Fifty players had dropped from the league during the first two years, with several of them citing the stress the league places on them and mental health issues.\nLitigation.\nIn July 2017, a trademark dispute arose when Major League Baseball (MLB) association expressed concerns regarding the logo that Blizzard had registered for the Overwatch League. MLB argued that Blizzard's logo bore similarities to their own, raising the potential for confusion among consumers. However, following the initial complaint, no further filings were made by Major League Baseball within the required dispute period. This suggested that either MLB decided to drop the dispute, or an undisclosed understanding was reached between MLB and the Overwatch League, allowing the league to continue using the logo.\nIn July 2021, \"Dot Esports\" reported that the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) was investigating the Overwatch League in regards to their team soft cap on players' salaries. In contrast to professional sports leagues like the NFL, where the use of player unions allows the league to implement salary caps under the Supreme Court ruling in \"Amalgamated Meat Cutters v. Jewel Tea Co.\", the Overwatch League currently lacks such unions, which would make salary caps potentially a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890. The league soft cap in 2020 was , and while a team could have salaries over that amount, they would be taxed as a luxury tax and would be considered detrimental. In October 2021, \"Sports Business Journal\" reported that the OWL would be eliminating the luxury tax and maximum salary caps. A settlement between the two parties was proposed, but according to a report by former \"ESPN\" writer Jacob Wolf in late 2022, Activision Blizzard refused to terms regarding particular requests that would endure after the proposed acquisition of Activision Blizzard by Microsoft. The Department of Justice filed a lawsuit, and Activision Blizzard agreed to settle the suit in April 2023, with provisions that would prohibit it from implementing similar measures in the future in the Overwatch League, the Call of Duty League, or any other esports league it operates.\nLegacy.\nActivision Blizzard used the Overwatch League model to establish the Call of Duty League in 2019. While the Call of Duty League was to have its inaugural season in 2020 with the same planned home/away format that the Overwatch League was planning the use in its third season, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the Call of Duty League to switch to a fully online format. The league was a central plot element in the seventeenth season episode \"Brave N00b World\" of \"American Dad!\" which was first broadcast in May 2020."

        "title": "2008 Breeders' Cup Classic",
        "text": "The 2008 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 25th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2008 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on October 25, 2008 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California over a synthetic dirt surface.\nDefending Horse of the Year Curlin was the odds-on favourite after winning several major races including the Dubai World Cup. However, he did not handle the track well and finished fourth, behind the American-bred but English-trained longshot Raven's Pass.\nThe Classic is run at a distance of one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse of $5,000,000. It is normally run on a dirt surface but in 2008 was run over synthetic dirt. It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nCurlin won the 2007 Breeders' Cup Classic on his way to Horse of the Year honors and started his 2008 campaign by taking the Dubai World Cup, followed by wins in Stephen Foster, Woodward and Jockey Club Gold Cup. His only loss in 2008 came in his first attempt on the turf in the Man o' War Stakes, at a time when his owner was considering an attempt at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Despite his excellent form throughout the year, Curlin had never raced on a synthetic dirt surface and was only entered in the race after a successful workout on October 14.\nThe field for the Classic was weakened when Big Brown, winner of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Haskell, was retired shortly before entries were taken due to injury. That left Colonel John, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, as the leading three-year-old contender from North America in the race.\nIn part because of the synthetic dirt surface, a large European contingent shipped to California for the Breeders' Cup events, including three entries in the Classic. With five Group I wins, Duke of Marmalade was the most highly regarded by the North American bettors at odds of 9-1, followed by Raven's Pass at 13-1. Henrythenavigator had defeated Raven's Pass in three of their four meetings, all at a mile, but was largely dismissed at 19-1 in the U.S. In England though, his odds were as short as 4-1. Raven's Pass had been regularly ridden by Jimmy Fortune in his European races but Fortune gave up the mount for the Breeders' Cup after incurring a suspension which prevented him riding for 11 days before the race. After discussing the ride with trainer Gosden, Fortune stepped down and Frankie Dettori took over.\nRace Description.\nCasino Drive set the early pace, with Curlin racing near the back of the pack behind Henrythenavigator and Raven's Pass tracking a few lengths further behind. Going into the final turn, the three started making up ground, with Henrythenavigator on the inside and Raven's Pass racing wide on the outside. Curlin kicked as they turned into the stretch and passed the early leaders with a furlong to go. Raven's Pass then made his run and accelerated by Curlin. Henrythenavigator maneuvered around horses to find racing room and closed well to finish second, beaten by of a length. Tiago also made a late run to finish third with Curlin holding on for fourth. The time was 1:59.27, a new track record. \nCurlin's trainer Steve Asmussen blamed the loss on the synthetic dirt surface, saying \"It was a turf race.\" The biggest mystery was why Curlin, a horse of proven stamina, faded late, while two European horses who specialized at a distance of a mile were able to outrun him in the stretch. Curlin may have made his move too soon, as the track appeared to favor horses who made late runs.\nFrankie Dettori, the jockey of Raven's Pass, was commended for an excellent ride. \"The last furlong was a pretty long run,\" he said, \"but I could feel [Raven's Pass] was still galloping strongly. When I crossed the line, I didn't know if it was true or a dream, but I realised straight away that it was true and I'm delighted.\"\nRaven's Pass became the first British-based horse to win the Classic, although it was something of a homecoming for his trainer John Gosden, who had spent 11 years in Southern California before returning to England. \"It doesn't get any better than this\", he said. \"All our great friends are here, from the guys that are raking up in the shed areas to the owners, trainers, and jockeys. If you think it's going to get better than that, you're really a greedy so-and-so. To me, this is a dream come true and a day I'll cherish the rest of my life.\"\n\"I had no doubts that the horse could get a mile and an eighth\", he said later. \"I didn't know about the last eighth of a mile, but I suspected it with Lord at War as his broodmare sire. There is good stamina on the dam side. And the way he trained – he's so relaxed now – that I was\nactually quite confident that he would get it well and he certainly did.\"\nResults.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: – 0:23.77; – 0:47.60; – 1:11.64; mile – 1:35.48; final – 1:59.27.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.77) (:23.83) (:24.04) (:23.84) (:23.79)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

In the United States UHD broadcasts are available to cable subscribers of NBCUniversal, and to subscribers of satellite TV providers DirecTV and Dish Network.\nBroadcasters.\nOn 29 June 2015, the IOC announced that Discovery Communications—owner of Eurosport, had acquired exclusive rights to the Olympics from 2018 through 2024 across Europe, excluding Russia, on all platforms. Discovery will sub-license its broadcast rights to local free-to-air networks on a territorial basis. Discovery's rights deal will, initially, not cover France due to pre-existing rights deals with France Télévisions that run through the 2020 Games. Unlike previous pan-European deals, such as with the European Broadcasting Union and Sportfive, Discovery will not solely serve as a reseller, and intends to carry coverage on its regional properties, but has committed to sub-licensing at least 100 hours of coverage to free-to-air networks. In the United Kingdom, Discovery will sub-license exclusive pay television rights from the BBC (which still holds broadcast rights through 2020), in exchange for sub-licensing free-to-air rights to the 2022 and 2024 Olympics from Discovery.\nIn addition, IMG was awarded the in-flight/in-ships broadcast rights.

        "title": "Zimbabwe Rowing team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics",
        "text": "The Zimbabwe Rowing team at the 2016 Summer Paralympics was the first rowing team to represent their country at a Paralympic Games. The team entered the para mixed coxed four finishing last in their event. The team consisted of rowers Margret Bangajena, Michelle Garnett, Takudzwa Gwariro and Previous Wiri and their cox Jessica Davis. Managed by Davis' mother, Rachel Davies, the team captured the imagination of the press due to the unlikely story of the crew's formation and the hardships they faced on reaching the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro.\nFormation.\nRachel Davis, a Canadian sports administrator from Cambridge, Ontario, was assigned to Zimbabwe in 1996 by her employers, Fédération Internationale des Sociétés d'Aviron (FISA), where her role was to improve the sport of rowing in Africa. The following year she married a Zimbabwean, had a family and settled down in the country. In 2012 Davis successfully coached and registered two Zimbabwean rowers for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Micheen Thornycroft and James Fraser-Mackenzie. When Thornycrofy decided to part company from Davis to train permanently with the South African team, it left Davis with free time to spare, which resulted in a new FISA request. In an attempt to widen the appeal of rowing the International Paralympic Committee assigned four berths for African teams in the rowing program at the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. Kenya and South Africa had already taken three of the positions, and FISA now asked Davis to put forward a Zimbabwe team for the last slot.\nDavis had no experience in adaptive rowing, and Zimbabwe had no program either. With only two months before the Paralympic qualifying camp in Italy, Davis sent out a call on social media for people with disabilities who would be interested in rowing at the Paralympics. Eighteen people responded to her call, meeting at St. George's College, Harare where Davis taught. None had any rowing experience and most could not swim. The candidates had little understanding of competitive rowing, and one sixty year-old applicant arrived in her Sunday best, wearing a shower cap to protect her hair. Overwhelmed by the response, as Davis was expecting only a handful of responders, she decided to assemble a team rather than enter single scull events. Initially Davis was concerned about understanding how adaptive rowers were classified, but fortunately two physiotherapists turned up at the first meet hoping to help out the athletes for \"Olympic trials\", who were able to assess the volunteers.\nThe initial meet gave Davis three members of her mixed cox team, but she needed a second male member. Noticing that Takudzwa Gwariro, a fellow PE teacher at the school, walked with a limp, she inquired if he would like to join the team. He accepted, giving the team just three weeks to train together before the trials in Italy. The team's preparations for Italy were far from perfect, training on a dam which was home to crocodiles with having to use antiquated boats. Further problems came after a public transit boycott meant the rowers couldn't travel to the dam.\nCompetition.\nThe team that travelled to Italy consisted of Takudzwa Gwariro, Margret Bangajena, Previous Wiri, Chipo Zhento and Davis' daughter Jessica as their able-bodied cox. Their chances were almost dashed at the first hurdle after Zhento suffered a seizure. The team was asked to pull-out, but a Cameroon doctor, who knew the shame that would be brought onto Zheno's family if she caused the team to fail, cleared Zhento to compete. Although the team finished second to last, ahead of Japan, they qualified for Rio after being offered a bipartite invitation. After the team returned home Zhento suffered another seizure, and Davis was forced to find a replacement. With only a week before a World Cup race in Poland, an event the team had to compete in to show international competition experience, Michelle Garnett, was drafted in.\nAt the Rio Games, Zimbabwe finished sixth from a field of six in the heats, with a time of 4:08.63. In the Final B, they again finished in last place, but Davis stated that she was satisfied with the team's performance considering the limited time they team had to train together.\nTeam.\nMargret Bangajena.\nMargret Bangajena (born 14 May 1977) answered the initial call for rowers, and rows in the bow seat. Bangajena had some experience in parasport having raced in wheelchair marathon events.\nMichelle Garnett.\nMichelle Garnett (born 15 December 1998) was the youngest member of the Zimbabwe team at the Rio Paralympics. At the time of the Games Garnett was a student at Chisipite Senior School.\nTakudzwa Gwariro.\nTakudzwa Gwariro (born 23 January 1996) was the final member recruited to join the initial team for the trials in Italy. A former rugby union player, Gwariro injured his leg in his last year of high school whilst playing the sport, resulting in nerve damage to his right foot which left him with a limp. At the time of the Rio Games he was working as a Physical Education teacher in Harare. At the Games he was given the honour of flag bearer at the opening ceremony. He has ambitions of studying law and attending university outside of Africa.\nPrevious Wiri.\nPrevious Wiri (born 6 June 1987) was one of the athletes who turned up at the initial meet. Rowing from the stroke seat, Wiri had a long background in parasport having played wheelchair basketball and competed in para-swimming and wheelchair marathon events.\nJessica Davis.\nJessica Davis (born 2 October 1998) was the team cox, and daughter of head coach Rachel Davis. Davis was the only able-bodied member of the squad and at the time of the Games she was a high school student at Peterhouse Girls' School."

        "text": "Jon Boden (born 19 October 1978) is a rugby union footballer/coach, currently playing at Fly-half or Centre for Leicester Lions in National League 2 North. He has played higher level rugby (second tier) for Rugby Lions and Doncaster Knights, as well as European rugby with Italian side Gran Parma (now disbanded). An excellent kicker, as of the end of the 2015–16 season, Jon is the all-time points scorer in National League 2 North with over 2,000 points.\nCareer.\nAfter spending some of his early career playing rugby league with the London Broncos, Jon moved to Italy to play rugby union for Italian side, Gran Parma, where he became a regular in the team, gaining Super 10 and European Shield experience. In the autumn of 2002, after two years in Italy, Jon returned to England to sign for the Rugby Lions, then playing in division 2 of the English rugby union league system. Despite appearing and scoring regularly for the Lions, Jon's time with the club was not successful, as they suffered consecutive relegations in the two seasons he was there.\nFollowing the Lion's relegation, in the summer of 2004 Jon moved north to sign for Doncaster, who were playing in the same division that Rugby had just been relegated from. After several dismal seasons, Jon's luck was to change as he made 20 league appearances for his new club, who won the league and promotion to the second division. Jon spent several more seasons with Doncaster, where he became a squad player, but decided to leave during the 2006–07 season as Doncaster were becoming a professional outfit and he could not combine full-time rugby with his other job role as a school teacher.\nAt the start of 2007 Jon joined tier 4 side, Leicester Lions, where he was signed as a player-coach. Jon became an invaluable player at the Lions, finishing as the league's top scorer in 2008 with 282 points as the Lions finished 4th. Since then he has regularly finished as one of the top kickers in what is now known as National League 2 North becoming the most prolific points scorer in the division of all time as of the end of the 2016–17 season. In the summer of 2017 Jon was part of the Leicestershire county side that won the 2017 County Championship Plate with a 39–7 win over Hampshire at Twickenham Stadium.\nHonours and records.\nNational League 2 North\nDoncaster Knights\nLeicester Lions\nLeicestershire"

        "text": "The 1877 men's tennis season was composed of 5 tournaments for the second edition pre-open era lawn tennis season. Before the birth of Open Era (tennis), most tournaments were reserved for amateur athletes. In 1874 British Major Walter Clopton Wingfield patented with the House of London Crafts the invention of a new game, which consisted of a shaped field hourglass, divided in the middle by a suspended net. The game was packaged in a box containing some balls, four paddles, the net components and the signs to mark the field. The game was based on the rules of the old real tennis and, at the suggestion of Arthur Balfour, was called lawn-tennis. The official date of birth of the court would be February 23, 1874. In 1877 all were amateur tournaments, among them was the first 1877 Wimbledon Championship, the inaugural event was held from 9 to 19 July and saw as the inaugural winner Spencer Gore. The tournament would remain for a period of 35 years the sole major tennis tournament in the world until the International Lawn Tennis Federation introduces its three World championship series events in 1913 that continue until 1923, when the U.S. Lawn Tennis Association (f. 1881) only agrees to join the ILTF on the basis of two compromises: the title 'World Championships' would be abolished and wording would be 'for ever in the English language'. Wimbledon would still retain its prestigious and historical status, and become one of the four Grand Slam tennis events from 1924.\nWhilst Wimbledon was the most prominent event of this inaugural new sport season in Ireland two other tournaments were also staged, one taking place in Waterford and the other was University of Dublin Lawn Tennis Championships.\nCalendar.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match. The challenge round was used in the early history of tennis (from 1877 through 1921), in some tournaments not all.* Indicates challenger\nNotes 2:\"Tournaments in italics were events that were staged only once that season\"\nJanuary to June.\n\"No events\"\nAugust.\n\"No events\"\nNovember to December.\n\"No events\"\nList of tournament winners.\nImportant tournament in bold"

        "title": "Coffin corner (American football)",
        "text": "The coffin corner refers to the corner of the playing field in American football just in front of the end zone, from about the 5-yard line to the goal line. A perfect coffin corner kick is one that goes out of bounds just before either orange pylon located in the front of the end zone. The punter tries to place the ball so that it lands out of bounds or is downed on the field by another member of the kicking team anywhere inside the 5-yard line without touching the goal line, thus forcing poor field position for the receiving team on their next offensive series.\nThe term comes from the \"coffin corner\" found in Victorian houses (the slang and often refuted term for a decorative niche, or very small \"corner\", cut into the wall of a staircase landing), as the target area is very small. A high level of skill is required to execute such a punt, for if the kick is slightly too far into the end zone or if a member of the kicking team touches the goal line while maintaining possession of or touching the ball, a touchback is awarded, costing the kicking team the advantage that comes with a successful execution of the kick. If the ball goes out of bounds too far upfield, the receiving team will usually have more options on offense, such as being able to drop back for a pass without fear of possibly giving up a safety.\nMore often than not, a kicker's attempt to land the ball accurately within the coffin corner fails, as the amount of skill required to angle a kick inside such a small area is extraordinary. In recent years, as punters have become more adept at kicking the ball so as to not have it bounce forward after landing, punting teams have increasingly eschewed coffin corner punts in favor of kicking inbounds and downing the ball before it reaches the end zone."

        "title": "History of the Argentina national rugby union team",
        "text": "The History of the Argentina national rugby union team starts with the first international played by an Argentine side against the British Isles in 1910 when they toured on South America. Argentina gained recognition in 1965, when the team toured South Africa playing a series of friendly matches there. In that tour the national team was nicknamed \"Los Pumas\", a name that became an identity mark for Argentina, remaining to present days.\nArgentina has taken part in all the Rugby World Cups since the first edition in 1987, being their best performance the 3rd place achieved in 2007. The national side also plays the Rugby Championship since the 2012 edition, after joining the competition one year before.\nBackground.\nIn the middle of the 19th century, the Irish immigrants in Argentina introduced sports and helped establish clubs in the country, although the first clubs in Argentina only admitted English members. Natives were rarely accepted, most of the cases as an exception.\nThe first rugby union match in Argentina was played in 1873, in the Buenos Aires Cricket Club Ground, located in Palermo, Buenos Aires. Both teams were formed by members of the BACC and they play a mix between football and rugby.\nOn 29 June 1886, it is recorded that Buenos Aires F.C. (predecessor of current Buenos Aires Cricket &amp; Rugby Club) and Rosario A.C. played the first inter-club match at Plaza Jewell, Rosario, Santa Fe.\nIn 1899, four clubs in Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires, joined to form the River Plate Rugby Football Union and organised the first club championship that same year.\n1910–1936: From the first matches to World War I.\nIn 1910, a side managed by Oxford University – supposedly the England national team, but including three Scottish players — toured Argentina as part of the celebrations for the 100th anniversary of the May Revolution. The people of Argentina termed it the \"Combined British\", also known as \"Great Britain XV\". Argentina made its international debut against this team under the name \"The River Plate Rugby Football Union\" on 12 June. The match was played at Sociedad Sportiva Argentina of Palermo and Argentina lost 28–3. The only try for the Argentine squad (the first international try) was scored by Buenos Aires F.C. player Frank Heriot. The Argentina line-up was: J.E. Saffey; C. McCarthy, Oswald Gebbie (cap), F. Heriot, Henry Talbot; Carlos Mold, W.A. Watson; Barry Heatlie, L.H. Gribell, W.M. Hayman; F. Henrys, F.W. Sawyer; A. Bovet, A. Donelly, Alvan Reid., all of them descendants of British immigrants. Argentina's most notable players were captain Oswald St. John Gebbie and Barrie Heatlie, a South African that had played for the Springboks.\nIn 1927, the British Lions toured Argentina for a second time, with the Lions winning all nine encounters; the tour did, however, become a financial success for Argentine rugby. Of the nine encounters, four tests were played, which Argentina lost by over 30 points in all. All the games took place in Buenos Aires. The important fact was that all the players on the field were Argentine-born.\n1927 also saw the first time Argentina wore the traditional light blue and white jersey, after a proposal from Mr. Abelardo Gutiérrez of Gimnasia y Esgrima de Buenos Aires. That request was accepted and Argentina wore the striped uniform v. the British Lions.\nFive years passed until another international team would return to Argentina, which would be the Junior Springboks, who arrived in the country for the first time in 1932 to play a series of friendly matches v. local clubs and combined teams. On July 16 and 23 the JS played Argentina, winning both matches, 42–0 and 34–3, respectively. The line-up for the first match was R. de Abelleyra; H. Maurer, A. Turner, C. Echeverría, N. Escary ; E.J. Stanfield, J.E. Bridger; J.L. Francombe, N. C. Tozer, G.A. Stewart, Ernesto Cilley, A. Navajas, K.A.M. Cookson, Arturo Rodríguez, C.A. Huntley Robertson (captain)\nTwo of the members of the Junior Springboks, Rybeck Elliot and Wollie Wolheim, would return to Argentina one year later to play for Hindú Club.\nIn 1936 the British Isles visited Argentina again, winning all ten of their matches and only conceding nine points in the whole tour. Only one test was played on the tour, with Argentina losing 23–0. The following month, Argentina left the country to play their first away tests – against Chile in Valparaíso. Argentina won the first test (and their first game), 29–0. The second match was won by a similar margin. Two years later Argentina hosted Chile, which resulted in Argentina winning by 30 points.\nPost war period.\nArgentina hosted the first South American tournament, in 1951. The other teams participating were Uruguay and Chile.\nArgentina won the tournament after large victories over Uruguay (62–0) and Brazil (72–0) being the last v. Chile by 13–3. All the matches were played at Estadio G.E.B.A.\nIn 1954 the French national team toured Argentina and Chile playing with the national team on August 29 at Gimnasia y Esgrima. Argentina lost the match by 8–22. On September 12, both teams played a second test match at the same venue, with another victory for France which won by 30–3.\nAt the second South American tournament, in 1958, Argentina accounted for Uruguay 50–3 and Peru 44–0, and finally Argentina emerged victorious against the hosts Chile in Santiago, by 14–0 to win their second title.\nIn 1959 the Junior Springboks returned to South America to play a series of friendly matches in Buenos Aires and Rosario against local clubs and combined teams. The South African played Argentina in two test-matches at GEBA, winning both fixtures 14–6, and 20–5. The JS played a total of 15 matches in Argentina, winning all of them.\nThe third edition of the South American competition, in 1961 held in Uruguay found Argentina to win their third consecutive title after defeating Chile (11–3), Brazil (thrashing them by 60–0) and local team Uruguay by 36–3, with all the matches being played at Carrasco Polo of Montevideo.\nArgentina won their four South American title in 1964 with victories over Uruguay (25–6), Brazil and Chile (both with the same score, 30–8).\n1960s: The birth of \"Los Pumas\".\nIn 1960, France visited Argentina and Uruguay for a series of 13 matches, 3 of them against Argentina. The hosts still could not get their first win over the French, with France winning all three tests 37–3, 12–3 and 29–6, all of them played at Estadio G.E.B.A. The Argentine line-up for the first game was 15.Rodolfo Devoto, 14.Enrique Krossler, 13.Esteban Karplus, 12.Ricardo Oliveri, 11.Enrico Neri, 10.Isidro Comas (cap), 9.Eduardo González del Solar, 8.Florencio Varela, 7. Glauco Wessek, 6.Jorge Pulido, 5.Aitor Otano, 4.Rodolfo Schmidt, 3.Eduardo Sorhaburu, 2.Juan Casanegra, 1.Elías Gavina\nThe following year Argentina again showed their dominance at continental level, winning the South American tournament held in Montevideo by beating Brazil 60–0, Uruguay 36–3 and Chile 11–3. In 1964, a new version of the South American tournament was played in San Pablo and Argentina again achieved huge victories over Uruguay (25–6), Brazil (30–5) and Chile (30–8).\nIn the late 1960s, the four home unions began tours of Argentina, and after Wales struggled in both tests in Buenos Aires in 1967, it became clear that Argentina would be a difficult place to win a series. Scotland lost the first test in 1968, but won a close second test two weeks later.\nThe first trip by the Argentina national rugby team to the other side of the Atlantic was to Rhodesia and South Africa in 1965. The team acquired the nickname \"Pumas\", from a local journalist of \"The Weekly Farers\" after their first tour match, a defeat on 8 May by Rhodesia in Salisbury 17–12. The journalist mistook the animal that appeared on the UAR emblem (a \"yaguareté\") for a puma, probably because it was an unknown species in South Africa. Nevertheless, the nickname has remained as a mark of identity for the team since then. After defeats by Salisbury and Northern Transvaal, the first win came against Western Transvaal, another against South West Africa Country Districts and finally against the Southern Universities. The Pumas scored a landmark win of 11–6 against the Junior Springboks on June 19 at Ellis Park Stadium. The line-up for that historic day was Roberto Cazenave; Enrico Neri, Marcelo Pascual, Arturo Rodríguez Jurado (h), Eduardo España; Eduardo Poggi, Adolfo Etchegaray; Raúl Loyola, Héctor Silva, Eduardo Scharenberg; Rodolfo Schmidt, Aitor Otaño (c); Ronnie Foster, Nicanor González del Solar, Luis García Yáñez.\nThat victory over the Junior Springboks was widely praised by the media, being considered as the first landmark victory by the Argentine rugby team since the beginning of the sport in the country. Argentina played a total of 16 matches, with 11 won and only 4 lost over two months. The players were welcomed home to Buenos Aires by a huge crowd.\nA match was then organised against the French champions Section Paloise, although the match was remembered for the uproar and misconduct of both teams rather than the Argentine victory. Then Oxford &amp; Cambridge arrived, a team that the Pumas had never beaten. The first match finished level at 19–19 and the second saw the University students triumph 9–3. 1965 ended with a match against Chile, which the Pumas won 23–11.\nIn 1966, the Gazelles – a kind of a Junior Springboks B team – arrived in Argentina. The visitors took two victories 9–3 and 20–15. In September 1967, Argentina played in Buenos Aires in the South American Championship with victories over Uruguay 38–6 and Chile 18–0. Wales arrived in Buenos Aires in 1968; for the first time in their history, the Pumas were able to triumph in a series, winning the first match 9–5 and drawing the second 9–9. The first great decade in Argentine rugby came to a close with the arrival of Scotland in 1969. The first match saw a big Argentine victory 20–3, but in the second game the visitors narrowly won 6–3.\nIn 1968, Wales toured Argentina to play six games. Argentina defeated Wales in the first test by 9–6, with the following line-up: 15.Jorge Seaton, 14.Mario Walther, 13.Arturo Rodriguez Jurado, 12.Marcelo Pascual, 11.Alejandro Travaglini, 10.Jorge Dartiguelongue, 9.Adolfo Etchegaray, 7.Miguel Chesta, 8. Hector Silva, 6.Raul Loyola, 5.Aitor Otano, 4.Adrian Anthony, 3.Marcelo Farina, 2.Ricardo Handley, 1.Luis Garcia Yanez. The second test finished in a 9–9 tie.\nThe 1970s: multiple tours.\nThrough the 1970s, Argentina confirmed its steady rise towards top-tier status under the influence of its first truly world-class player, fly-half Hugo Porta.\nIn 1971, Argentina did a second tour of South Africa that included a series of 14 matches played in June and July. The \"Pumas\" didn't play against the Springboks (playing meanwhile in Australia, but against the Gazelles, the selection of emerging under-23 players). There was also originally scheduled a match in Rhodesia, but it was cancelled after a prohibition by the Argentine government. Argentina won 9 games, being defeated 4 times. The line-up v. the Gazelles was D. Morgan; M. Pascual, R. Matarazzo, A. Rodríguez Jurado (h), A. Travaglini; R. Espagnol, G. Blaksley; H. Silva (c), J. Wittman, N. Carbone; B. Otaño, A. Anthony; R. Foster, R. Handley, L. García Yáñez.\nTwo years later, \"Los Pumas\" went on a tour to Ireland and Scotland, playing 8 matches in October and November. Argentina won only two games, losing four with two draws. In the matches v. national sides, Argentina lost to Ireland by 21–8 on November 10. The other game vs a national team was v. Scotland, 14 days later, which Argentina lost by 12–11.\nThe second Argentine tour of Europe came in 1975, when the team played seven matches in France during October. Argentina won 3 matches, with 4 losses, two of them vs. the France national team (29–6 and 36–21). One year later, Argentina went on a tour of Wales and England to play 6 matches. During their tour, the \"Pumas\" came tantalizingly close to a historic victory at Cardiff Arms Park over Wales, then the dominant force in the Northern Hemisphere. Only a Phil Bennett penalty on a foul by Gabriel Travaglini at the death allowed the Welsh to escape with a 20–19 victory. The line-up for Argentina v. Wales was Martin Sansot; Daniel Beccar Varela, Alejandro Travaglini, Gonzalo Beccar Varela, Jorge Gauweloose; Hugo Porta, Adolfo Etchegaray (C); Jorge Carracedo, Ricardo Mastai, Carlos Neyra; José Fernández, Eliseo Branca; Rito Iraneta, Jose Costante, Fernando Insúa. Argentina played a total of 6 matches, winning 3 with 3 losses. Some of the club teams Argentina faced were Cardiff and Aberavon.\nTwo years later Argentina returned to participate in competitions for their tour of England, Ireland and Italy. The team held a virtually full-strength England XV to a 13–13 draw, before losing 6–19 to Italy in the first test match between them. Argentina also played the Wales B team, being beaten by 17–14. The tour captain, Hugo Porta, played all nine games, scored 94 of the team's 157 points on tour and established himself as one of the world's great players on the tour.\nThe last tour of the Argentine side was in 1979, when the team travelled to New Zealand to play a series of nine games. Argentina won 6 of them, losing 3 games. On September 18, Argentina played the All Blacks for the first time in their history. The match, held at Carisbrook, was won by New Zealand by 18–9. The Argentine line-up was Martín Sansot; Adolfo Cappelletti, Marcelo Loffreda, Rafael Madero, Marcelo Ocampo; Hugo Porta, Alfredo Soares Gache; Gabriel Travaglini, Tomas Petersen, Héctor Silva; Marcos Iachetti, Alejandro Iachetti; Enrique Rodriguez, Javier Pérez Cobo, Hugo Nicola. The second test-match, played one week later, ended in another victory for New Zealand by 15–6.\nThat same year, the Australian side toured Argentina for the first time. During October and November, Australia played a series of seven games. In the first test match, Argentina defeated Australia by 24–13 on October 27 at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium. In the second game (played on November 3), Argentina was defeated by 17–12.\n1980s: growth in importance.\nDuring the 1980s, several teams toured South America, including Argentina. This allowed the Pumas to face some of the most important sides of the world, such as England, France, New Zealand and Australia national rugby union team. From the late seventies to the early nineties, Argentina never lost the two matches of a series held in Buenos Aires.\nAfter the British Lions visits in 1909 and 1927, the England national team arrived in Argentina for the first time in 1981. The English side played seven matches in the country, with Argentina achieving a 19–19 tie at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium on May 31. Six days later, England won the second test by 12–6.\nIn 1985 France toured South America, playing a series of 7 matches in Argentina. The national side achieved its first victory over a French national team, a 24–16 victory on 22 June at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium. The line-up was: B. Miguens; J. Lanza, Turnes, Cuesta Silva, Annichini; Porta, J. Miguens; Allen, Ure, Petersen; Milano, Branca; Cash, Cubelli, Morel. The second test match would be won by France.\nThat same year, Los Pumas played the All Blacks, who were doing a tour of the country to play a series of matches in October and November. Argentina lost the first match by 33–20. Nevertheless, the national side achieved a historic 21–21 tie on November 2 at Ferro C. Oeste, with all points converted by Hugo Porta. The line-up for that notable match was Diego Cash; Alejandro Cubelli, Fernando Morel; Eliseo Branca, Gustavo Milano; Tomás Petersen, Jorge Allen, Ernesto Ure; Guillermo Holmgren, Hugo Porta (c); Pedro Lanza, Diego Cuesta Silva, Fabián Turnes, Juan Lanza, Bernardo Miguens. Due to those results, some journalists widely regard 1985 as the best year in Los Pumas' history.\nFrance returned to Argentina in 1986 as part of their Oceania tour. Argentina achieved their second victory over France on May 31 by 15–13 at Vélez Sársfield stadium in Buenos Aires. Seven days later, Argentina was defeated by France at the same venue.\nIn 1987, Argentina played the first Rugby World Cup held in New Zealand and Australia. The team had a poor campaign, losing to Fiji and New Zealand in the pool stage, with only one victory over Italy. The team finished 3rd of Pool 3, being eliminated.\nAfter the WC, Australia arrived in Argentina in 1987 to play a series of nine matches. Argentina remained unbeaten in the two test-matches played vs. the Australian side, with a 19–19 tie in the first game and an outstanding victory by 27-19 in the second match on November 7 at Vélez Sársfield. The line-up was Rafael Madero; Diego Cuesta Silva, Marcelo Loffreda, Fabián Turnes, A. Scolni; H. Porta (c), A.Soares Gache; J. Allen, G. Milano, P. Garretón; A. Iachetti, E. Branca; Diego Cash, A. Courreges, Serafín Dengra.\nFrance toured again in 1988 (the third time that decade). Argentina lost the first test by 15–18 and won the second, played on June 25, by 18–6. The line-up was A. Scolni; D. Cuesta Silva, Loffreda, Turnes, Mendy; R. Madero, Baetti; Allen (c), Milano, Garretón; Iachetti, Branca; Cash, Courreges, Dengra. Both games were played at Vélez Sarsfield.\n1990s: process of transition.\nOver the following years, the retirement of many of Argentina's most experienced players, and the defection of many others to professional leagues (UAR's regulations of the time prevented any player who played professionally from playing for the national team) left Argentina with an inexperienced side. This led to disappointing performances in the 1991 and 1995 World Cups, although in the latter Argentina presented a powerful pack which was praised by the international media. Argentina's tighthead prop, Patricio Noriega and hooker, Federico Méndez, went to play in Australia and South Africa respectively after their performance. Noriega even played for the Wallabies.\nThe Pumas toured the British Isles in 1990, playing their first away match versus the England senior team and their first ever test-matches versus the Ireland and Scotland senior squads. Although Argentina had a two-point loss to Ireland (20–18), the squad was smashed by England (51–0) and Scotland (49–3).\nIn 1991 the All Blacks returned to Argentina. The national team was defeated in both tests, 28–14 and 36–6, at Vélez Sársfield.\nArgentina went on a new tour of Europe in 1992, where the team defeated Spain, Romania and France (24–22). Two years later Argentina toured South Africa to play six matches, losing both tests to the Springboks (42–22 and 46–26). The 1995 tour of Australia continued with poor results, losing to the national side (53–7 and 30–13). In 1996 Argentina went to England, losing 20–18 at Twickenham. The 1997 tour on New Zealand found Argentina being heavily defeated by the All Blacks (93–8 –the biggest defeat in the team's history– and 62–10). One year later, Argentina would be beaten by Japan, Italy, France and Wales in the same tour. The only positive result for the national side was a 31–22 victory over 1999 Five Nations Championship Scotland on August 21 at the Murrayfield Stadium, during the 1999 tour of the British Isles.\nA more experienced and somewhat under-rated squad made it to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time. In the WC, Argentina lost the first game to Wales (23–18), then defeating Samoa (32–16) and Japan (33–12), finishing second in their group to Wales, and went onto the quarter-final play-offs. After a vibrant 28–24 win against Ireland, the \"Pumas\" were eliminated by France, 28–47, in the quarter-final. Gonzalo Quesada was the highest overall points scorer in the tournament with 102. The outstanding performance by Quesada earned him the Olimpia de Oro (Golden Olimpia), the top sports award of Argentina.\nThe new millennium.\nIn April 2000, Marcelo Loffreda was appointed coach of Argentina. Argentina participated in the 2003 World Cup, but missed out on progressing to the quarter-finals due to a 15–16 loss to Ireland. Because of the fixture list, Argentina had to play four games in a fortnight, whereas Ireland played the same number of games in four weeks.\nIn 2004 Argentina showed good form, splitting a midyear two-test home series with Wales. Los Pumas handed defending Six Nations champion France a 24–14 loss in November 2004 at Marseille, before losing 21–19 to Ireland on a last-minute drop goal. After returning to Argentina, the Pumas lost 39–7 to the visiting Springboks; however, the Pumas were without 10 regular starters who had returned to their club teams in Europe.\nPerhaps one of the Pumas' best matches of the decade came on 23 May 2005, when they played the British &amp; Irish Lions in Cardiff before the Lions' tour to New Zealand. The Pumas chose a side of second- and third-choice players as 25 players were unavailable due to club commitments. An inspired Pumas performance, combined with lacklustre play by a mostly second-choice Lions side, put Argentina on the verge of a great upset until a Jonny Wilkinson penalty at the death salvaged a 25–25 draw and the Lions avoided a humiliating defeat.\nWhen the Springboks returned to Argentina in November of that year at Vélez Sársfield, they faced a much stronger Pumas side, with most of their European-based players present. The Pumas took a 20–16 lead into the half-time break, before fading the second half and losing 34–23. The following week, the Pumas defeated Scotland 23–19 Murrayfield for the Pumas fifth consecutive win over Scotland since 1990.\nIn the 2006 mid-year tests, Argentina swept Wales in a two-test tour for their first test series win over Wales. Argentina won the first test 27–25, in the first Argentina test in Patagonia. The second test at Vélez Sársfield saw the Pumas win 45–27, Argentina's largest win ever over Wales. \"Los Pumas\" next hosted the All Blacks at Vélez Sársfield. The All Blacks survived a Pumas assault in the final minutes to hang on to win 25–19 and to deny Argentina a huge upset. Argentina then defeated Chile 60–13 in Santiago and defeated Uruguay 26–0 at home to qualify for the 2007 Rugby World Cup.\nThe 2006 end-of-year Tests began with a bang for \"Los Pumas\", as they handed a 25–18 defeat at Twickenham, resulting in the fans booing the England team off the pitch. Further success followed for the Pumas, defeating Italy in Rome, and coming within one point of beating France in Paris.\n\"The Sunday Times\" of London reported in February 2007 that the IRB was brokering a deal with SANZAR, the body that organises the Tri Nations, to admit \"Los Pumas\" to the competition. However, \"The Sunday Times\" indicated that one of the biggest stumbling blocks was the UAR's commitment to amateurism. By August of that year, it became clear that the competition would not be expanded until the key SANZAR media contract with News Corporation expired in 2010. An IRB spokesman noted the contract, Southern Hemisphere fixture congestion, and the lack of a professional structure in Argentina as reasons that \"Los Pumas\" could not be admitted any sooner.\n2007 World Cup semifinal.\n\"Los Pumas\" began their final preparation for the 2007 Rugby World Cup with a summer two-test series against visiting Ireland, with a 22–20 win at Santa Fe, and a 16–0 win at Vélez Sársfield. \"Los Pumas\" then completed a clean sweep of their mid-year tests with a 24–6 win over in Mendoza.\nThey split their final warmup tests, defeating 70–14 at CASI in Buenos Aires, before losing to Wales 20–27 at Millennium Stadium.\nAt the World Cup, \"Los Pumas\" were drawn into the so-called pool of death, featuring two other teams ranked in the top six in the IRB rankings—Ireland and the hosts France. On top of this, they opened the World Cup at Stade de France against the French, marking the third consecutive World Cup in which they played against the host nation in the World Cup opener. The Pumas took a 17–9 lead into the half, and held on for a surprising 17–12 win. The Pumas subsequently beat Georgia 33–3 at the Stade de Gerland, Lyon. Argentina then beat Namibia 63–3 in Marseille, the biggest winning margin in Argentine World Cup history. They then secured a 30–15 victory against Ireland, which ensured that Argentina topped the group.\nArgentina then defeated Scotland 19–13 in the quarter-final at the Stade de France. The Pumas' improbable run towards the Webb Ellis trophy ended in a comprehensive 37–13 defeat by the Springboks in the semi-final at Stade de France. However, the Pumas recovered to beat France for the second time in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, a 34–10 win in the 3rd/4th place playoff. The 3rd place showing for the Pumas in the 2007 Rugby World Cup was Argentina's best ever result in Rugby World Cup history. Argentina's performance marked the first time that a team from outside the Six Nations or Tri Nations competition reached the semifinals of the Rugby World Cup, and gave renewed momentum propelling Argentina towards joining one of those competitions.\nDuring their World Cup run, the normally football-crazed Argentines embraced the \"Pumas\" so much that \"El Superclásico\", the Buenos Aires football derby between Boca Juniors and River Plate, was rescheduled so that it would not conflict with the Pumas' quarter-final match. As the only major Spanish language country in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, the Pumas also had considerable support from rugby fans in Spain, Uruguay, and other Latin American countries during their impressive five-game winning streak.\nAfter the 2007 World Cup.\nIn November 2007, in the wake of Argentina's World Cup run, the future status of \"Los Pumas\" was a key topic of discussion at an IRB conference on the future worldwide growth of the sport. The decisions made at the conference regarding Argentina were:\nOn March 13, 2008, Santiago Phelan was named as the coach of the Argentine rugby union team, filling the vacancy left by Marcelo Loffreda.\nOn 7 June 2008, the Pumas beat Scotland 21–15 in Rosario, Argentina, thus maintaining their position as the third highest ranked team in the IRB rankings.\nIn June 2009 the British media reported that Argentina were lobbying for the 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia to incorporate provincial games and test matches in Argentina, but nothing came of this proposal.\nArgentina failed to get a test series victory under Phelan, with a draw against Scotland in 2008 and England in 2009, before losing 2–0 to Scotland in 2010.\n2011 Rugby World Cup.\nWorld Cup preparations for Los Pumas began with a drawn 1–1 series against the French Barbarians, a 78–15 win against a South American Invitational XV, and a 21–15 victory against the Aviva Premiership club Worcester Warriors. In their only international test warm-up match, Los Pumas lost 28–13 to Wales in Cardiff.\n\"Los Pumas\" kicked off their 2011 World Cup with a 13–9 loss against England, a match which they led for over 60 minutes. They next beat Romania 43–8. The following match against Scotland decided which team would reach the quarterfinals. A late try by replacement fullback Lucas González Amorosino and a successful conversion meant Los Pumas won 13–12. Argentina finished the pool stage by winning 25–9 against Georgia.\nArgentina's final match of the tournament was the quarterfinal against eventual champions All Blacks. In a surprisingly close first half, Argentina led 7–6 after 30 minutes following a try by Julio Farías Cabello. As the game went on, the All Blacks began to dominate, leading to a final score of 33–10.\nWhile not as glamorous as the 2007 tournament for the Pumas, their campaign was considered relatively successful as they qualified for the quarterfinals from a pool that featured England and Scotland, and put up a valiant quarterfinal display against the All Blacks. It marked the first time that Argentina qualified for the quarterfinals in two consecutive World Cup tournaments.\n2012: The Rugby Championship.\nIn 2012, Argentina again drew a test series against France.\n2012 saw a major breakthrough for the Pumas, as they joined The Rugby Championship (formerly known as the Tri Nations) against New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. This was the first time Argentina participated in an annual Tier 1 international competition.\nArgentina played its first match of the 2012 Rugby Championship against South Africa in Cape Town on 18 August 2012, losing 27–6. Argentina quickly recovered one week later in Mendoza to achieve a 16–16 score against South Africa, its first draw in history against the Springboks. Argentina acquitted themselves well against Australia, losing 19–23 and then 19–25 to earn a losing bonus point in each match. Argentina also played respectably against the All Blacks in New Zealand, with Argentina keeping the score 5–6 at the half before losing 5–21. Despite ending bottom of the table with just 4 points and no wins in their inaugural season, Argentina proved hard to beat when home.\nIn the November 2012 test series, Argentina beat Wales at the Millennium Stadium, and lost against France and Ireland also on the road. In June 2013, the team lost both matches against England in Argentina, and beat tier 2 squad Georgia.\nArgentina lost 2–0 to England in 2013 including a record 32–3 defeat in the opening test, the biggest losing margin Argentina has had against England on home soil. Argentina achieved the occasional \"upset\", including a 9–6 win over Scotland at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh and a 26–12 win over Wales, who at the time were the Six Nations Grand Slam Champions, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff.\nIn 2013, Argentina began their second tournament with a record breaking 73–13 defeat by South Africa, which was South Africa's biggest winning margin over Argentina. In the reverse fixture at home in round 2, Argentina proved to be a formidable team, but lost narrowly to South Africa 17–22.\nIn round 3 they played New Zealand who was victorious in the match 28–13. In Round 4, they lost to Australia in Perth 14–13. In the corresponding home fixture, Argentina lost 54–17 to Australia, a record losing margin against Australia at home. It was the second year in a row with Argentina finishing bottom of the table at the Rugby Championship, this time losing all matches.\nOn October 21, 2013, Phelan stepped down from his post as Los Pumas head coach, one year early from the end of his contract. Over the 45 matches that he coached in his 5-year tenure, he earned 13 wins, 31 defeats and 1 draw.\nDaniel Hourcade was hired as new Pumas head coach in October 2013. In November 2013, the Pumas were beaten by England and Wales in Twickenham and Cardiff, and later won against Italy in Rome. In the 2014 mid-year rugby union internationals, Argentina lost their games against Ireland and Scotland.\nOn 5 October 2014, Los Pumas achieved their first ever win in the Rugby Championship, defeating Australia 21–17 at the Estadio Malvinas Argentinas in Mendoza, their first win over Australia in 17 years. Despite that win, Argentina finished in last place in the Rugby Championship for the third consecutive year.\nIn the 2014 European end-of-year tests, Argentina lost to Scotland, and beat Italy and France,\nIn the 2015 Rugby Championship, Argentina beat South Africa for the first time 37–25.\nIn the 2020 edition, again convert in a Tri Nations format because of the Pandemic, (South Africa did not play), Argentina defeat the All Blacks for the first time in history. Argentina dominated in almost every facet to notch a deserved 25-15 victory at Sydney's Bankwest Stadium. Fly half Nicolas Sánchez scored all 25 points.\n2015 Rugby World Cup.\nArgentina followed their growing competitiveness in the Rugby Championship with a strong showing in the 2015 World Cup, reaching the semi-finals for the second time. Argentina opened the tournament with a close fought match against favourites New Zealand, leading 13–12 at half time before eventually conceding two second half tries to lose 26–16. They followed this with a string of convincing wins against Georgia, Tonga and Namibia to qualify for the quarterfinals. A feature of Argentina's rugby in the 2015 World Cup was their free-flowing, entertaining and attacking style of play which resulted in them scoring 22 tries in pool play.\nIn the quarter-final against Ireland, Argentina scored two tries in the opening 10 minutes to jump out to an early 17–0 lead. Ireland regrouped and scored two tries of their own either side of half time to narrow the gap to 20-17 early in the second half. However, Argentina rallied in the late stages of the match, running in late tries by Juan Imhoff and Joaquín Tuculet to eventually finish with a convincing 43–20 win. As a result, they advanced to their second semi-final against Australia.\nThe situation was reversed in the semi-final, when Argentina conceded 2 tries in the opening 10 minutes as Australia gained a 19–6 lead after 30 minutes. Argentina dominated the territory and possession of the remainder of the match, gaining a number of penalties at the scrum to gradually reduce Australia's lead. The match was finely balanced with Australia leading 22-15 after 70 minutes, when Australian winger Drew Mitchell produced a match winning run, beating 4 Argentinian tacklers before passing to Adam Ashley-Cooper to score the winning try. The match finished with Australia winning a fast-paced and entertaining clash 29–15."

A maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Dirt Mile) are allowed to start in each race. Winners of the Challenge races were given automatic entries, while other pre-entries were ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nTwo Challenge series winners went on to win their respective division at the Breeders' Cup:\nA few Challenge series winners could not compete at the Breeders' Cup due to illness, injury or retirement. Exaggerator, who qualified for the Classic by winning the Haskell, was retired in October. Cavorting, who qualified for two Breeders' Cup races, developed some bone bruising and was also retired in October. The Gurkha, who qualified for the Mile by winning the Sussex Stakes, suffered a ruptured colon and was retired.

The Sri Lankan team manager, Bandula Warnapura, as was the case a few months earlier at the Hero Cup, blamed the batting failures of the first two test matches on poor umpiring decisions.\nThe series was played on spin-friendly pitches on which India had built up a formidable record. India won their eighth straight home win since the defeat of Sri Lanka in 1990-91 and their second successive series whitewash after beating England in 1992-93. Contrary to popular beliefs of the time that test matches in India produced boring draws, this series meant that the last 12 tests, from Madras in 1987-88 had produced a result- 11 wins for India. Azharuddin joined Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi and Sunil Gavaskar as India's most successful captains, with 9 wins each.\nFurther cause for celebration for India came when Kapil Dev became test cricket's highest wicket-taker, surpassing Richard Hadlee's tally of 431, which had stood for three and a half years."

Miles made his Leicester debut against Handsworth on 9 September 1899 scoring a hat trick. However that was not enough to keep his place in the team and he did not play again until 25 October 1899 against Bedford School where he scored 2 tries. He did not become a regular in the first team until the 1901/02 season where he scored 20 tries in 26 appearances; continuing that form he scored 14 tries in 17 games the next season to earn his England cap.\nMiles made his international debut for England on 10 January 1903 against Wales at St Helens in Swansea. This made him the first home produced international for Leicester Tigers, having gone to Medway Street School and played for Stoneygate before joining Tigers.\nMiles also played for Northampton Saints.\nSources.\nFarmer,Stuart &amp; Hands, David \"Tigers-Official History of Leicester Football Club\" (The Rugby DevelopmentFoundation )"

        "text": "Brudenell River Golf Course is a public golf course located in Brudenell, Prince Edward Island. The course is an eighteen-hole course built by the provincial government of Prince Edward Island was originally opened in 1969. The course gets its name from the Brudenell River, which is part of The Three Rivers, as several of the courses holes lie along the river. The Brudenell River Golf Course shares the practice grounds and clubhouse with its sister course Dundarave Golf Course.\nHistory.\nThe Brudenell River golf course started out as a nine-hole course at the location of the current course. In the late 60s, a member of the Legislative Assembly, Lorne Bonnell, in conjunction with a group of the course's regulars, built the current course. The provincial government expanded the course to 18 holes with the intent of drawing tourism to the Eastern region of Prince Edward Island. The full 18-hole golf course officially opened in 1969.\nIn 2007, the provincial government began looking to sell the Brudenell River Golf course, along with the other three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance; losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season. Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted as saying, \"Obviously, when you're on the floor of the estimates [committee] … and you're saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that maybe that would have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,\" in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season, no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by the provincial government.\nCourse.\nBrudenell River is one of Prince Edward Island's top golf courses. It has been awarded as one of the top 50 golf courses in Canada, and Top 6 Best Golf Resorts in Canada by Score Golf. The course lies beside the Brudenell River, which is part of The Three Rivers and from which the course receives its name. This course has a nontraditional par format, containing six par-3s, six par-4s and six par-5s. It shares practice grounds, clubhouse and intertwines with its sister course Dundarave Golf Course to make a 36-hole facility."

        "text": "The 2006 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 23rd edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. It took place on November 4 at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The 2006 Breeders' Cup results were highly influential in the Eclipse Award divisional championship voting.\nLead-up.\nFor 2006, the total purse money offered at the Breeders' Cup increased from $14 million to $20 million. The Classic, Turf, Filly and Mare Turf, Sprint, and Juvenile Fillies all had their purses increased by $1 million. The Mile and Juvenile had their purse increased by $500,000. The purse increases made Breeders' Cup day the second richest in racing, behind Dubai World Cup day with total purses of $21 million.\nThe event was broadcast by ESPN for the first time, with Trevor Denman calling the races.\nResults.\nThe heavy favorite for the Classic was Bernardini, who had won six straight races including the Preakness Stakes, Travers and Jockey Club Gold Cup. Next choice at 6:1 was Lava Man, who had a seven race winning streak in California. The third choice was Invasor, an Argentinian-bred colt who had won the Uruguayan Triple Crown before being purchased by Shadwell Stable and moved to Dubai then America, where he won three straight Grade I races. Invasor had lost only once in his career but had not run in the three months leading up to the Classic after spiking a fever. In the Classic, Bernardini hit the lead at the top of the stretch but Invasor closed rapidly in the center of the track, eventually winning by a length. Lava Man had a troubled trip and finished seventh. Invasor was named Champion Older Horse and Horse of the Year, while Bernardini was named Champion Three-Year-Old Male.\nOuija Board, who won the Filly &amp; Mare Turf in 2004 then finished second in 2005, justified being the heavy favorite in the 2006 renewal with an \"explosive\" stretch run that swept her to a length victory over Filmmaker. \"I was very fortunate to have ridden her\", said jockey Frankie Dettori. \"She's the best filly in the world, without a doubt.\" The win made Ouija Board the leading money-earning female horse in history and earned her a second Eclipse Award for Champion Turf Female, despite having only the one start in America in 2006.\nStreet Sense won the Juvenile at odds of 15:1 by a record 10 lengths, sweeping from the back of the pack to first place with a strong move on the rail. Street Sense was named Champion Two-Year-Old colt at the Eclipse Awards and would later win the Kentucky Derby in similar fashion, breaking the so-called \"Juvenile Curse\" by becoming the first horse to win both races.\nThe Distaff was marred by injuries to the two favorites, Fleet Indian and Pine Island. Fleet Indian, who was later named Champion Older Female Horse, suffered a compound fracture in her left front fetlock, which was surgically repaired. Pine Island dislocated her left front ankle and had to be euthanized because of infection. Long-shot Round Pond won the race comfortably, though the celebration of her connections was muted. \"I've been in that situation and nobody ever likes to see that happen,\" said her trainer Michael Matz, who had also been the trainer of Barbaro.\nThe Turf was won by Irish-bred Red Rocks, who was the longest shot of four European entries after losing his previous four races. He trailed behind a fast early pace then out-kicked Better Talk Now. Favored Hurricane Run, winner of the 2005 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, finished sixth.\nDreaming of Anna, Thor's Echo and Miesque's Approval, winners of the Juvenile Fillies, Sprint and Mile respectively, were also Eclipse Award winners in their respective divisions.\nWith so many longshots winning, the Pick 6 (which excluded the two Juvenile races) paid nearly $1.5 million. The attendance was 75,132, third highest in the history of the event. The parimutuel handle was $136,726,378 (common pool), including $18,259,971 bet on track, both records.\nSummary.\nSource: Equibase"

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball career putouts as a pitcher leaders",
        "text": "In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base, catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a fly out), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. The pitcher is the player who pitches the baseball from the pitcher's mound toward the catcher to begin each play, with the goal of retiring a batter, who attempts to either make contact with the pitched ball or draw a walk. The pitcher is often considered the most important player on the defensive side of the game, playing the most difficult and specialized position, and as such is regarded as being at the right end of the defensive spectrum. Pitchers play far less than players at other positions, generally appearing in only two or three games per week; only one pitcher in major league history has appeared in 100 games in a single season. There are many different types of pitchers, generally divided between starting pitchers and relief pitchers, which include the middle reliever, lefty specialist, setup man, and closer. In the scoring system used to record defensive plays, the pitcher is assigned the number 1.\nPitchers typically record putouts by catching line drives or pop-ups, or by covering first base on ground balls to the first baseman. On pop-ups, however, pitchers will often instead act as a defensive supervisor, evaluating the ball's arc and selecting which infielder should make the catch. Pitchers can also record a putout while covering home plate by tagging a runner attempting to score a run if the catcher is retrieving a wild pitch, passed ball, or errant throw. Because of the relative rarity of such plays, as well as their reduced playing time, pitchers record far fewer putouts than players at any other position; players at every other position have recorded between five and forty-three times as many putouts as the top pitcher. Only four pitchers in history – none since 1886 – have recorded 50 putouts in a season, a total which a first baseman might reach in a week.\nCareer putout totals for pitchers have generally risen with the increase in long careers, and the lengthening of the major league season in the early 1960s. The top 11 career leaders are all starting pitchers who have been active since 1962. Right-handed pitchers generally record more putouts due to their facing first base after the follow-through of their pitching motion; the top 24 leaders are all right-handed. Greg Maddux is the all-time leader in career putouts by a pitcher with 546; he is the only pitcher to record more than 400 career putouts."

A three by Sanders to open the second half gave Milan its first lead. Hickman netted another three and Davide Pascolo converted a three-point play to boost the margin to 46-40. Andrea Cinciarini further extended the margin to 9 before strong play by Gani Lawal sparked a Sassari comeback. A David Bell jumper made it 56-54 through three quarters. It was still a 2-point game four minutes into the fourth quarter when Hickman and Macvan combined for all Milan’s points in an 11-2 march to take a 75-64 advantage with 3:38 remaining. Sassari raced back with 8 straight points, but was held to a single basket over the final two minutes as Milan closed out the game from the line. Trevor Lacey paced Sassari with 15 points, Lawal scored 13 and Rok Stipcevic 11.\nSponsors.\nSource:"

        "title": "Lacrosse in the United States",
        "text": "The sport of lacrosse has been played in the United States by Native Americans long before European exploration. The sport is most popular in the northeast and mid-Atlantic areas of the country. However, the game has recently developed into a popular team sport for both men and women in all regions of the United States.\nU.S. national teams.\nEvery year the United States puts together five teams to compete on an international level. There is a men's indoor team, and four outdoor teams: men's, women's, men's under 19 and women's under 19. Since the beginning of the men's World Lacrosse Championship in 1967, the United States national teams have won a total of thirty world championships.\nProfessional lacrosse.\nPremier Lacrosse League.\nIn 2018, star lacrosse player Paul Rabil introduced a new league, called the Premier Lacrosse League. It is a joint venture with his brother, Mike. Three main contributors are The Chernin Group, Joe Tsai and The Raine Group. It consists of eight teams, Chaos Lacrosse Club, Chrome Lacrosse Club, Atlas Lacrosse Club, Whipsnakes Lacrosse Club, Redwoods Lacrosse Club, Waterdogs Lacrosse Club, Cannons Lacrosse Club and Archers Lacrosse Club. It currently has a deal with NBC Sports to broadcast the games. The league shortened the field by 10 yards, and introduced many other new rules in order to speed the game up. It also offered higher salaries than Major League Lacrosse, health-care, and a stake in the company. The league is using a tour based system, so the franchises aren't based in any cities. Its inaugural season was in 2019.\nMajor League Lacrosse.\nIn 1998, Jake Steinfeld became inspired by an article that spoke about the growth of lacrosse, and wanted to develop a professional outdoor league. By 2001, the MLL or Major League Lacrosse had started play to capitalize on the growing demand of lacrosse both in the United States and around the world.\nMajor League Lacrosse is currently a six-team professional league with the bulk of the teams in the Northeastern United States. Many of these players are considered some of the best, if not the best, in the world. The current Major League Lacrosse teams include: Atlanta Blaze, Boston Cannons, New York Lizards, Chesapeake Bayhawks, Denver Outlaws, Dallas Rattlers, along with the Charlotte Hounds, who are on a hiatus. Unlike high school and college lacrosse, the MLL uses a two-point line on its field that sits sixteen yards from the front of the goal. They also have recently implemented a sixty-second shot clock which speeds up an already fast-paced game.\nOn December 16, 2020, the league announced that it would be merging with the Premier Lacrosse League.\nNational Lacrosse League.\nIn addition to Major League Lacrosse, which is played outdoors in the summer, the National Lacrosse League, which had its first season in 1987, is a box lacrosse league from January to June. Because of these differing schedules, many current professional lacrosse players will start the year off in box lacrosse and end with outdoor lacrosse in the summer. Box lacrosse is a slightly different version of traditional lacrosse and is played in a dried-out hockey rink. Goalies wear pads comparable to the pads an ice hockey player would traditionally wear. Games in box lacrosse also feature six players versus six instead of ten versus ten matchups in outdoor lacrosse. There are currently fifteen teams in the National Lacrosse League. They are the Albany FireWolves, Buffalo Bandits, Calgary Roughnecks, Colorado Mammoth, Georgia Swarm, Halifax Thunderbirds, Las Vegas Desert Dogs, New York Riptide, Panther City Lacrosse Club, Philadelphia Wings, Rochester Knighthawks, San Diego Seals, Saskatchewan Rush, Toronto Rock, and Vancouver Warriors.\nUnited Women’s Lacrosse League.\nStarting in 2016, the United Women's Lacrosse League began play. Currently, the league's teams are located only on the northern east coast as these areas can draw the biggest fan bases. The teams involved in the league play are the Baltimore Ride, the Boston Storm, the Long Island Sound, and the Philadelphia Force. At the moment, players have their travel expenses paid for but do not receive a salary as the thirty to forty-thousand-dollar budget is currently used to keep the league running. By comparison, players in the MLL make somewhere between ten and twenty-five thousand dollars a year.\nWomen’s Professional Lacrosse League.\nThe Women's Professional Lacrosse League (WPLL) is a women's lacrosse league in the United States. The league is composed of five teams: the Baltimore Brave, New England Command, New York Fight, Philadelphia Fire, and Upstate Pride. League play started on Saturday, June 2, 2018.\nStructure and function.\nLacrosse is a full field, 10 vs 10 contact sport. Each team has one goalie, three defenders, three mid fielders, and three attackmen. Throughout the contest, players attempt use their sticks to shoot the ball into the opponent's goal. At the end of the game, the team with the most goals wins. In college lacrosse, the games consist of four, fifteen minute quarters. This game length decreases to twelve minutes per quarter at the high school level, and decreases to ten minute per quarter at the little league level.\nEach team must have five players (a goalie and four defenders typically), on their defensive side of the field at all times. They must also have four players (usually four attackmen) on their offensive side of the ball at all times. The remaining three players (usually midfielders or middies) are free to roam the field as they please during the game. There are twelve players on the field at a time. Still each team is allowed a maximum of seven players on their half of the field at a team and six players on their opponents’ side of the field at a time with the goalie being the extra man. Like hockey, substitutions are considered “on the fly” meaning that the players may enter and exit the field during gameplay assuming each team has a maximum of ten players on the field at the time. The game essentially has the same rules as hockey and is played both indoor (box lacrosse) and outdoor (full field).\nHistory.\nLacrosse started out as a tribal ritual for Native Americans to play before going to war. Differences between groups may have been settled through large, multi-day games covering expansive fields and many players. The game was originally known as stickball. Ever since its creation, it has been considered a collision sport like football and hockey, not a contact sport like basketball and soccer. For a short amount of time, lacrosse was a full-fledged Olympic sport. After westward expansion, Europeans modified the game to make it much more alike the college and high school level game played today. When natives played lacrosse, dodging defenders was considered cowardly and was looked down upon. Since they were preparing for war, they were taught to embrace the pains involved with playing the game and fight through them. Throwing the ball from stick to stick was seen as a trick in the game, not a commonly utilized skill. Nowadays, these two trends have changed in a great way. Being able to skillfully pass from between teammates and dodge defenders to create open shots have become a pinnacle of today's current game.\nGrowth.\nLacrosse in the US is currently one of the fastest growing sports in America. With a faster growth rate than swimming, bowling, water polo, cross country, ice hockey, and soccer, there were 36,000 college lacrosse players in the United States as of 2015. From 2009 to 2014 the growth rate for lacrosse has been 28%. In 2009, 1,984 high schools across the country had sponsored a lacrosse program, but by 2014, 2,535 high schools across the country had sponsored a lacrosse program. Originally lacrosse was only played on the east coast, but it is starting to make a move out to the middle and west of the United States. 750,000 children across the United States played lacrosse in 2015. For junior league lacrosse, the growth rate has been 43% for boys and girls. Denver became the first non-east coast team in history to make it to the NCAA division 1 finals in 2015."

        "title": "2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony",
        "text": "The 2022 Winter Olympics closing ceremony was held at the Beijing National Stadium in Beijing on 20 February 2022. As mandated by the Olympic Charter, the proceedings are expected to combine the formal ceremonial closing of this international sporting event (including closing speeches, hoisting of the flags, the parade of athletes, and the handover of the Olympic flag) with an artistic spectacle to showcase the culture and history of the current and next host nation (Italy) for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo.\nThe closing ceremony was directed by film director and producer Zhang Yimou, who also directed the opening ceremonies of the 2022 Winter Olympics and previously directed and produced the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nTheme and Concept.\nAccording to Zhao Weidong head of the 2022 Olympic organising committee's media department the theme of the closing ceremony will be:\nAs stated by Zhang Yimou, somewhere during the closing ceremony will re-create a moment from the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics, as for the Beijing National Stadium being the venue for the ceremonies of both Summer and Winter Olympics.\nProceedings.\nSource:\nEntrance of the President of China and the President of the IOC.\nAt 8:00pm China Standard Time, Chinese President Xi Jinping and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach entered the stadium.\nLighting the Emblem.\nAs the closing ceremony takes place five days after the Lantern Festival, which is the final day of the Chinese New Year celebrations, a performance was held to celebrate and promote the culture of the Chinese New Year through lanterns. Children danced and played with lanterns while interacting with the large snowflake cauldron in the center of the stadium. Their movement formed the emblem of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The lanterns were shaped like snowflakes to commemorate the overlap of both the Winter Olympics and the Chinese New Year celebration as well as to highlight the tradition of playing with lanterns during the Lantern Festival.\nEntry of countries' and regions' flags &amp; Parade of nations.\nContinuing from the lantern performance, twelve sleds shaped in the form of Chinese zodiac animals, namely the rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake, horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, and pig, carved out a Chinese knot on the floor, joining the children with lanterns in continuing the celebration of the Chinese New Year. The zodiac animals represent the interlinkage of the Chinese calendar and its solar terms. Animations performed by ribbons wrapped around the giant snowflake cauldron to form a hybrid combination of the Chinese knot and the lantern. The flags of the 91 competing nations entered the stadium first, followed by all the athletes who were still in Beijing marching in together as one group accompanied by an arrangement of Beethoven's \"Ode to Joy\". The athletes gathered on the knot, symbolizing the Chinese culture of family reunion for the Chinese New Year.\nGreek National Anthem and handover of the Olympic flag.\nFirst, the Greek flag was raised while the Greek national anthem is played. The Olympic flag was then lowered and folded while the Olympic Hymn was sung in Greek. Afterwards, the flag was passed from the mayor of Beijing, Chen Jining, to IOC president Thomas Bach, who then hand it over to the mayors of Milan, Giuseppe Sala, and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Gianpietro Ghedina. This was followed by the raising of the flag of Italy and the playing of its anthem sung by Italian singer Malika Ayane. During the Italian national anthem, a projection of stars (representing the 7,904 comuni of the country at the time) formed the outline of Italy. The Olympic flag will be raised again on January 19, 2024 for the opening ceremonies of the 2024 Winter Youth Olympics in Gangwon Province, South Korea.\nMilan-Cortina 2026: \"Duality, together\".\nAs per tradition, Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, the host cities of the 2026 Winter Olympic Games presented an artistic performance at the closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympics. But due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and using this year organizing concept; \"less is more\", the producer Marco Balich needed only use 6 performers.\nThe artistic performance of the segment is called \"Duality, Together\", which coincidentally matched with \"Together for a shared future\", the slogan of the 2022 Winter Olympics. According to Christian Milici (Head of Events), they aimed to celebrate the harmony which links two cities (Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo) that are very seemingly different, but are in dialogue with each other. Because of this, the segment was focused on the harmony between humanity and nature. The segment starts out with two children with the names of the host cities on each of their backs rolling and hugging a inflated vinyl plastic globe, representing the two next host cities inviting the world for the 2026 games and the history of the Silk Road (a historical important trading route traced by Marco Polo which was the first link between Europe and Asia). The first film depicted the two dancers trekking across the host cities: a man running in the urban landscape of Milan and a woman running in the snowy mountains of Cortina d'Ampezzo, both of whom represent the two cities. After the first film, the two then performed together on the stadium in a modern dance sequel to represent the history and the cultural aspects of Italy. After the segment, a second film was shown depicting various athletes holding several Italian flags and flags with the 2026 Winter Olympics logo. It then shows several open-aired meetings across the country as Frecce Tricolori flies over Venice (main hotspot from Veneto, the region where Cortina is located) and the Italian Alps and introduced the two host regions, Lombardy and Veneto.\nClosing Speeches.\nAlong the final speech and remarks made by Cai Qi, president and chairman of the Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, the IOC President Thomas Bach formally declared the games closed, praising them as excellent and unforgettable, as per the Olympic Charter he invited in French the youth of the world to meet again in Milan and Cortina D'Ampezzo in four years time.\nVideo: Farewell! Together for a shared future!\nFollowing the declaration of the closing of the Games, a video was shown of Beijing citizens and Winter Games volunteers bidding farewell to their international guests. It concluded with Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen waving to a snowflake as it flies toward the sky.\nExtinguishing of the Olympic flame and Final last closing events.\nThe Olympic flame, burning in a torch placed in the middle of a giant snowflake-shaped cauldron, was descending while one of the most striking scenes from the opening ceremony of the 2008 Summer Olympics was being reproduced (when the Olympic rings were formed on a carpet of LEDs that was suspended) gradually extinguished while \"You and Me\", the theme song of the 2008 Summer Olympics, was sampled when the flame finally touched the ground and was extinguished, then they started to play \"Snowflakes\", the theme song of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which was sung by the Beijing Philharmonic Choir (北京愛樂合唱團). This scene was written to highlight the fact that the city made the historical achievement of being the first city to host both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, to end the ceremony as the Olympic Charter determines and a large display of fireworks started. A large display of fireworks followed and ended the show along with the farewell musical song \"Auld Lang Syne\", sung by all member artists and the musical choir because the closing ceremony ended exactly at 21:40 CST, to mark the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics."

        "title": "2005 Breeders' Cup",
        "text": "The 2005 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 22nd edition of the premier event of the North American thoroughbred horse racing year. The eight races, all of which were Grade I, took place on October 29 at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York and were telecast by NBC. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The results of the races were highly influential in that year's Eclipse Award voting.\nThe highlight of the event was Saint Liam's victory in the Classic, wrapping up a campaign that earned him Horse of the Year honors.\nLead-up.\nIn 2005, Belmont Park celebrated its 100th anniversary and hosted the Breeders' Cup for the fourth time. At the time, Belmont Park was part of a regular rotation of the event between racetracks on the East Coast, West Coast (Hollywood Park or Santa Anita), Kentucky (Churchill Downs) and Florida (Gulfstream Park) with smaller venues also used on occasion. Despite the success of the 2005 event, Belmont Park has not played host since that time.\nMost of the races had a strong morning-line favorite, led by four horses who were unbeaten in 2005 and some returning champions:\nHowever, the Classic was considered wide open, in part because of the injury or retirement of several stars including dual Classic winner Afleet Alex and the 2004 Horse of the Year Ghostzapper. In their absence, Saint Liam was slightly favored over Rock Hard Ten and Borrego in a full field of 14.\nResults.\nA crowd of 54,289 attended the event and bet $14.6 million on-track, then the largest handle in Belmont Park history. Only two favorites won and they had been considered the most vulnerable according to the morning line odds: Folklore and Saint Liam. Saint Liam's job was made easier by the late scratch of 2nd favorite Rock Hard Ten. He had however drawn an outside post position, which was a particular disadvantage as the Classic started on the clubhouse turn due to the dimensions of Belmont Park. Saint Liam broke poorly but jockey Jerry Bailey got him to settle before starting his move on the far turn. Saint Liam dueled with Flower Alley down the stretch, then drew away in the last 100 yards. \"You shouldn't dismiss the fact that the post this horse had breaking,\" said Bailey. \"He took the worst of it today, and still was very authoritative in winning.\"\nThe most disappointing performance was by Lost in the Fog, who would finish unplaced after starting his career with 10 straight wins. It is possible that he was already suffering the effects of the cancer that was diagnosed in August of the next year. In the Filly &amp; Mare Turf, Ouija Board made a late run but could not catch front-running Intercontinental. Ashado was defeated by 30-1 longshot Pleasant Home, who made an explosive move from last to first and won by lengths, the largest margin of victory at the 2005 Breeders' Cup.\nStevie Wonderboy posted a slight upset in the Juvenile, and the impressive performance combined with an earlier win in the Del Mar Futurity earned him Champion Two-Year-Old honors. It was the first win at the Breeders' Cup for owner Merv Griffin, trainer Doug O'Neill and jockey Garrett Gomez. Stevie Wonderboy became the early favorite for the 2006 Kentucky Derby but suffered a condylar fracture while in training for the race.\nShirocco became the first German-bred horse to win a Breeders' Cup race when he topped an \"all-European trifecta\" over Ace and Azamour in the Turf. Jockey Christophe Soumillon said, \"(Shirocco) likes soft ground and a good pace to run at and with the pacemaker in there, we got both today. When I got to the turn, I just wanted to let him go and not try to pull him back to mix up his action. We got two (lengths) in front and when he saw the wire, he just flew home.\"\nSeveral jockeys and trainers achieved notable results at the event. Jerry Bailey earned his fifteenth Breeders' Cup win on Saint Liam in the Classic – then a record. Garrett Gomez won both the Juvenile on Stevie Wonderboy and Mile on Artie Schiller, earning him the Shoemaker Award for outstanding performance by a jockey at the Breeders' Cup. Edgar Prado had also been under consideration for the award after scoring two wins of his own. Both Prado and Gomez had been winless at the Breeders' Cup prior to 2005. Trainer D. Wayne Lukas scored a record 18th victory with Folklore in the Juvenile Fillies. Trainer Rick Dutrow, who had served a 60-day suspension earlier in the year, trained two winners – Saint Liam in the Classic and Silver Train in the Sprint.\nThe races were telecast live by NBC, while Sirius Satellite Radio produced an 8-hour radio broadcast hosted by track announcer Dave Johnson.\nIn the 2005 Eclipse Award voting, four Breeders' Cup winners went on to be named the champion in their divisions (Stevie Wonderboy, Folklore, Saint Liam and Intercontinental), with Saint Liam also being named Horse of the Year.\nSource: Equibase"

        "text": "The 1970 ILTF Women's Tennis Circuit was the 57th season since the formation of the International Lawn Tennis Federation in 1913, and the 96th season since the first women's tournaments were held in 1876.\nAlso known as the World Tennis Circuit or simply the ILTF Circuit consisted of a worldwide series of 314 tennis tournaments played across 6 continental tennis circuits and administered by the ILTF and its associate members.\nThe circuit began in late December 1969 in Valencia, Spain and ended on 26 December 1970 in East London, South Africa.\n1970 was a very important year for women's tennis that would see the staging of two women only Virginia Slims events leading to a nascent Virginia Slims Circuit. The Virginia Slims Circuit would then be the platform for the formation of the Women's Tennis Association, which has risen to the structures of today.\nSummary of season.\nThe Open era began with the British Hard Court Championships in Bournemouth in 1968. At the first Open Wimbledon, the prize-fund difference was 2.5:1 in favour of men. Billie Jean King won £750 for taking the title, while Rod Laver took £2,000. The total purses of the competitions were £14,800 for men and £5,680 for women. By the 1970s, the pay difference which had been a 2.5:1 ratio between men and women had increased. In 1969, ratios of 5:1 in terms of pay were common at smaller tournaments; by 1970, these figures increased to 8:1 and even 12:1.\nThe situation came to a head in 1970, when most tournaments offered four times as much prize money to men than they did to women. At the 1970 Italian Open, men's singles champion Ilie Năstase was paid US$3,500 while women's singles champion King received just US$600. On top of this, the USLTA failed to organise any tournaments for women in 1970.\nBillie Jean King and eight other female tennis players – Americans Rosemary Casals, Nancy Richey, Peaches Bartkowicz, Kristy Pigeon, Valerie Ziegenfuss, Julie Heldman and Australians Kerry Melville Reid and Judy Tegart Dalton decided to enlist World Tennis magazine publisher Gladys Heldman to help negotiate for greater equality in prize money and provide valuable public relations assistance. All the players were putting their tennis careers at risk because the influential USLTA did not back them.\nGladys Heldman and the \"Original 9\" decided to target the Pacific Southwest Championships held in Los Angeles on the grounds that it paid eight times more money to men than it did to women. Heldman attempted to get the tournament chairman, former professional tennis player Jack Kramer, to reduce the inequality between the prize money purses for men and women. Kramer refused, leading the \"Original 9\" to declare at a press conference held at Forest Hills, New York that they would boycott the Pacific Southwest Championships and play at what would become the first Virginia Slims Circuit event, a US$7,500 Houston Women's Invitation tournament held in Houston, Texas in September 1970 Despite the USLTA's declaration that it would not sanction this event, the \"Original 9\" went ahead. The Virginia Slims Circuit provided the platform for the formation of the Women's Tennis Association, which has risen to the structures of today.\nThe 1970 ILTF women's tennis circuit began with Coupe Faucombridge tournament in Valencia, Spain. In the four most important tournaments of the year defending champion Margaret Court defeated Kerry Melville in the final, 6–3, 6–1 to win the women's singles tennis title at the Australian Open. It was her ninth Australian title. At the French Open defending champion Margaret Court defeated Helga Niessen in the final, 6–2, 6–4 to win the women's singles tennis title. It was her fifth French Open singles title.\nAt the Wimbledon Championships Margaret Court defeated Billie Jean King in the final, 14–12, 11–9 to win the ladies' singles tennis title, her third major singles title of the year, and her 19th major singles title overall. At the US Open defending champion Margaret Court defeated Rosie Casals in the final, 6–2, 2–6, 6–1 to win the women's singles tennis title at the 1970 US Open. With the win, Court completed the Grand Slam, becoming the second woman to achieve it after Maureen Connolly in (1953), and the first woman in the Open Era to do so. It was her record-breaking 20th major singles title, surpassing Helen Wills Moody's all-time tally. The circuit ended on 26 December 1970 at the Border Championships in East London, South Africa.\nSchedule.\nThis is a calendar of all official events that were administered by the International Lawn Tennis Federation in the year 1970, with player progression documented from the quarterfinals stage. The table also includes Grand Slam events, and tournaments on the African, Asian, Australasia, Central American &amp; Caribbean, European, and South American ILTF regional circuits, as part of the annual world tennis circuit.

They have active teams in \"EA Sports FC\", \"Dota 2\", \"League of Legends\" (PSG Talon), \"Rocket League\" and \"Arena of Valor\". Formerly, the club also had teams in \"Brawl Stars\", \"FIFA Online\" and \"\". Its headquarters and training center are located at the Studio PSG in Boulogne-Billancourt, which also hosts the Paris Saint-Germain Academy Esports. \nOrganization.\nPSG Studio.\nPSG Esports is headquartered in the PSG Studio, which also serves as the training center of its professional teams. This multifunctional 140m2 space, dedicated to sports and digital activities, is located in Boulogne-Billancourt, inside the headquarters of parent club Paris Saint-Germain. Announced in December 2020, the studio opened during the first half of 2021. The Gaming area hosts training sessions and competitions for PSG's professional teams as well as the Paris Saint-Germain Academy Esports. It also serves as a recording studio for the creation of digital content. The PSG Studio has a capacity of 19 people and is equipped with six PlayStation 5, five Nintendo Switch and five gaming PCs.\nAcademy.\nThe Paris Saint-Germain Academy Esports is the youth system of PSG Esports. It is located at the PSG Studio in Boulogne-Billancourt. Launched in December 2020, it aims to teach the practice of Esport through courses and training sessions on different video games and different media (PC or consoles), accompanied by professional coaches. The PSG Studio hosts video game fans of different ages from all over the world and offers course formats ranging from recreational to competitive (professional gaming).\nActive teams.\n\"EA Sports FC\".\nFounded in October 2016, PSG Esports entered esports with the creation of the club's team in football video game \"EA Sports FC\" (formerly known as \"FIFA\") that same month. In doing so, parent club Paris Saint-Germain became the first big European club to launch their professional esports department. Since their inception, the team has clinched six titles and boasted the likes of Daxe, Rocky, Agge, Rafifa13, Aameghessib, WNU Fiddle and Maniika. Their maiden trophy came at the Esports World Convention championships in 2016 courtesy of Daxe, who repeated the feat in the 2017 edition and then proceeded to win the Gamers Assembly later that same year. Agge, for his part, brought home the Legia eSports Cup and the FUT Champions DreamHack Winter in 2016, while WNU Fiddle claimed the Gfinity US Spring Cup in 2018.\nThe roster currently consists of coach Jojo and promising young French players Amarr and Nkantee.\n\"Dota 2\".\nFormed as a partnership between PSG and Chinese esports organization LGD Gaming in April 2018, the rebranded PSG.LGD team became one of the best \"Dota 2\" sides in the world, winning three Major championships at EPICENTER XL and the MDL Changsha Major in 2018 as well as the WePlay AniMajor in 2021. They also made it to the podium of The International three times, finishing second in 2018 and 2021 and third in 2019. In that time, PSG.LGD welcomed big \"Dota 2\" players like Ame, Somnus and fy. In September 2023, after five years of collaboration, PSG and LGD announced that they had parted ways due to \"different strategic visions.\" The Chinese team will now continue to compete under their original LGD Gaming name.\nShortly after, however, PSG announced the return of its \"Dota 2\" section after partnering with Qatar-based esports organisation Quest Esports in October 2023. The team, called PSG.Quest, will debut at The International 2023. Its roster for the competition is made up of TA2000, No!ob, Tobi, OmaR and kaori.\n\"League of Legends\".\nHaving acquired Team Huma's \"League of Legends\" (LoL) license in October 2016, PSG Esports debuted in the 2017 edition of the League of Legends Challenger Series with the aim of reaching the League of Legends EMEA Championship (LEC), Europe's top \"LoL\" division. The team's roster was revealed in December 2016, consisting of Steve, Blanc, Kirei, Sprattel and Pilot. Duke joined as coach in February 2017. Following two unsuccessful attempts to qualify for the LEC via the Challenger Series, the club withdrew from the game in October 2017, also citing issues with the revenue sharing model presented by Riot Games at the time.\nPSG confirmed its return to \"LoL\" in June 2020. The club concluded a multi-year team partnership agreement with Hong Kong based professional esports organisation Talon Esports to form PSG Talon. The co-branded team competes in the Pacific Championship Series (PCS), with the season being divided into Spring and Summer. PSG have won three Spring Splits (2021, 2022, 2023) and two Summer Splits (2021, 2023), for a total of five PCS titles. PSG and Talon Esports extended their collaboration for a further three years in May 2023.\n\"Brawl Stars\".\nPSG Esports entered mobile game \"Brawl Stars\" in February 2019, with an all-French team featuring Trapa as coach and gamers SunBentley, TwistiTwik and Tony M. They won their first trophy in September 2019, being crowned champions of the ECN \"Brawl Stars\" Summer. After a roster makeover, the team — now composed of Asian players Response, CoupDeAce and Scythe — went on to clinch the \"Brawl Stars\" World Championship in November 2020. The tournament was a one-sided affair as PSG won all of their sets and pocketed $250k. They defeated both Nova Esports and SK Gaming by a score of 3–0 to reach the final, where PSG secured a further 3–0 victory, this time against INTZ, and the world title. Response was named MVP of the tournament.\n\"Rocket League\".\nPSG Esports announced its participation in vehicular soccer video game \"Rocket League\" in September 2017 after signing the team of Ferra, Bluey and Chausette45. The trio gave PSG their first title in November 2017, when they were crowned ESL Championnat National champions at the Paris Games Week. The team won the DreamHack Leipzig next in February 2018. Despite Bluey's departure in August 2018, the new lineup — now featuring Fruity as his replacement — clinched The Colosseum later that month and retained the DreamHack title at Valencia in July 2019. A few weeks later, however, PSG unexpectedly announced that its \"Rocket League\" roster had left the club.\nInactive since that statement, made in early August 2019, the club made its comeback on \"Rocket League\" by teaming up with British organization Tundra Esports in May 2023. PSG.Tundra took part in the 2022–23 edition of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) and finished in 8th place, just shy of qualifying to the Major and World Championships. The team won its first title, the RTBF iXPé Online Sessions, in June 2023.\n\"Arena of Valor\".\nPSG Esports launched a team on \"Arena of Valor\" in July 2021. One of the most popular multiplayer online battle arena games in Asia, and particularly in Thailand, the team competes in the RoV Pro League, the Thai professional \"Arena of Valor\" tournament, and consists of an all-Thai roster and coach. Former team captain FirstOne, who transitioned from player to coach, has led his old teammates — Ash, Jdai, Nam-CS, Sharkz and Hrlquin — since their debut in August 2021.\nInactive teams.\n\"FIFA Online\".\nBuilding on their success on \"Dota 2\", PSG Esports and LGD Gaming expanded their partnership with a \"FIFA Online\" section in October 2018. The free-to-play dedicated to Asian territories entered the FIFA eWorld Cup circuit last year. The team's initial roster was made up of Yuwenc, MzDragon, Milano and Maniika. The project, however, was short-lived. Maniika departed in July 2019, followed by Yuwenc, MzDragon and Milano soon after. The club tried to rebuild with the signings of players Zarate and Ga but by 2020 they had also left the team, which has remained inactive ever since. Furthermore, the collaboration between PSG and LGD ended in September 2023.\n\"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\".\nFollowing their partnership with LGD Gaming on \"Dota 2\" and \"FIFA Online\", which allowed the club to enter the Chinese market, PSG Esports announced a new collaboration in February 2019, this time with the Rex Regum Qeon (RRQ) team to create a \"\" team. The club signed the roster of Indonesian Mobile Legends team RRQ, which consisted of Lemon, Tuturu, Liam, AyamJAGO, James and InstincT. The deal saw PSG become the first traditional sports team to enter mobile esports games via the \"Mobile Legends: Bang Bang\" league with the rebranded PSG.RRQ roster. In July 2019, after only seven months in which the PSG.RRQ team won the SEA Clash of Champions, the partnership between PSG and RRQ came to an end. Mainly, the club wanted to focus on other games, in particular \"Brawl Stars\", which is exploding in Europe."

        "title": "Welsh handball",
        "text": "Welsh handball () is one of the ancient native sports of Wales. It is related to coeval sports such as Irish handball, fives, and Basque pelota and is a possible antecedent of American handball. The sport has been continually attested since the Middle Ages and its popularity saw it become an important expression of Welsh culture, offering ordinary people opportunities through prize money, bookkeeping and even player professionalism.\nDue to its cultural significance games of Pêl-law were simply referred to as \"Chwarae Pêl\" (playing ball) and it has since been described as \"Wales’s first national sport\".\nRules and scoring.\nPêl-law shares many rules and its methods of scoring with other handball games, as well as squash and racquetball. A hard, leather-cased ball (a Spaldeen is often used today) is struck with the palm against a front wall. The objective is to keep the ball out of the opponent's reach but inside the bounds of play so that they are unable to return. Points are only awarded for the serving player.\nScores are marked on the front wall using the traditional \"box\" scoring system, and formal matches are overseen by an official score marker and one referee. Whilst historically the rules varied from village to village, the scoring method remained constant and is still in use today.\nHistory.\nEarly development.\nSimilar games to Pêl-law have been played throughout the world for thousands of years. Handball-like games have originated in several places at different times. Hieroglyphs in the temple of Osiris in Egypt portray priests taking part in a game very similar to handball. The Civilisations of South and Central America had a handball-like game, which was a large part of pre-Columbian culture. It is likely that the Welsh game has a similarly ancient origin.\nPêl-law has been attested in the literature of Wales since the Middle Ages, and was mentioned by Nennius in the ninth century. There is evidence that the game was played at Tintern Abbey and Raglan Castle once held a Pêl-law court inside its Great Hall of State.\nImportance to Welsh culture.\nBy the 15th century, the widespread understanding of pêl-law was great enough that the bard Guto'r Glyn wrote a popular \"cywydd\" for the game, simply entitled \"Y Bêl\" (). However, the sport's popularity became an issue in the Tudor period, as the government imposed greater restrictions on public life and the sport was banned by order of the English Crown. Sports were banned for a number of reasons, but in Wales they were particularly seen as a distraction from the practice of archery as Welsh longbowmen were integral to the defence of the kingdom.\nThe banned sports were also seen as encouraging gambling, violence and debauchery with only Christmas (and later Easter) seeing the ban relaxed. As sports enjoyed by the English nobility (such as jousting, bear-baiting and cock-fighting) continued with no such restrictions, the outlawed sports came to be seen as an expression of protest against the landowning class. This social context was exacerbated in Wales as authorities continued to characterise pêl-law games as havens of mob behavior, sedition and ultimately revolt. Similarly, the Laws in Wales Acts (1535 and 1542) removed historic Welsh institutions and barred Welsh people (or English people with Welsh connections) from positions of authority. As a result of these changes, the surviving Welsh folk-pursuits (such as pêl-law) gained a unique cultural significance for ordinary people.\nNational sport.\nThe game was initially played against the side of stone buildings like churches or castles, and the sport's popularity among the Welsh populace drew the ire of both Anglican and Non-conformist leaders, with one Methodist preacher telling his congregations that handball was among the things which were “taking the country to eternal woe”.\nThe 18th century saw the construction of the first purpose-built courts. The new open-backed courts were often built by the owners of public houses to attract trade and the new venues enabled Pêl-law unprecedented popularity as a spectator sport. However, the new crowds drew more complaints from landowners, who would often refer to the games as 'fives' a very similar game played by English grammar schools. In 1744 a Joanna Lond of Swansea was accused of: \"maintaining a certain gaming house for a certain unlawful game called fives\" and a letter written in 1817, states the author’s objection to the transformation of the courtyard of the church at Llandaff into a \"Fives court\", with games interrupting services. It is likely that such instances actually helped the game maintain a distinct attraction. With Welsh language terminology, an archaic scoring system and distinct working-class culture, any vilification by the Anglican church or local authority appear to have only added to the sport's unique appeal. This era also saw Pêl-law become popular in the west of England.\nThe late 19th century also saw a great number of workers move to Wales and it seems the increasing population enjoyed the sport. Irish handball was a related working-class sport and it is understood that Irish migrants played the Welsh game, with the construction of the Nelson court in the 1860s possibly built with Irish railway workers in mind.\nProfessional development.\nWith Wales' industrial development, and the sport's continued popularity, vast numbers were now able to spectate or compete and yet more players became professionals, leading to great rivalries between communities.\nOne of the first names of national renown was Richard Edwards (\"champion of every church yard in Denbighshire\"). Local champions like Billy Newnam of Llantrisant and the \"terrible Treharne twins\" of Pontypridd also enjoyed widespread fame and adulation. It was common for competitors to travel between villages and towns to challenge the champions of other localities, often for large sums of money.\nBy the 1870s, Dr Ifor Ajax-Lewis of Llantrisant and Richard Andrews, a miner from Nelson were offering enormous prize money to any player who could beat them. Andrews, known affectionately as \"‘Dic Ted’\" was particularly admired. Playing throughout the 1870s he played in many famous matches such as that against the 19 year old Peter Price. Peter was another miner at the nearby Taff Bargoed colliery, and their showdown was played in front of an especially large crowd at the Harp Inn in Gelligaer. Andrews would play a match against W Jones of New Tredegar for a then record purse of £20. By 1875, the record winnings had increased to £1000.\nDecline and revivals.\nWales endured great economic and cultural changes in the early twentieth century, with the boom Edwardian years (which saw the Welsh population grow more than 20%) followed by war, economic uncertainty and numerous industrial disasters. This societal turmoil was reflected by a decline in traditional Welsh activities such as Pêl-law, while further advances in transportation made it easier for teams and supporters to travel to the increasingly popular team sports like Rugby.\nThe Great Depression saw a notable revival however, with Pêl-law again becoming popular as an informal and almost costless street game for impoverished workers. The revival was especially prevalent in the Swansea area, where street versions were a notable feature throughout the city as late as the 1960s.\nAnother revival began with the formation of the Welsh Handball Association in 1987 to both preserve the Welsh game and coordinate international matches with nations playing similar games to Pêl-law. In 1995 markings for One Wall Handball were made within the three-walled Nelson court and in May that year the inaugural European One Wall Handball Tournament was held in Wales. Attended by representatives from Ireland, England, Belgium and even the USA. The tournament was based at Nelson, with Caerphilly and Bargoed also hosting matches. The new international competitions saw Welsh success in 1997 when Nelson's Lee Davies (Welsh champion throughout the 1990s) became World Champion.\nCourts.\nLocal courts were simply known as \"Y Plaen\" (The plain) or \"Plaen Pêl\" (Ball plain). These courts hosted both singles and doubles matches, and tended to be three walled structures (although one walled courts were also built). Courts were built all over Wales but especially in Glamorgan during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Today there are surviving courts at Llantrisant, Pontypridd, Laugharne, Mountain Ash and Ystrad Rhondda. However, all these courts are overgrown, partially demolished or unplayable. Only the Jersey Marine and Nelson courts are known to have survived largely complete, with the Nelson Court believed to be the only one to still be continually maintained.\nJersey Marine.\nAnother surviving handball court is Burrows Court in Jersey Marine. The Court was built in 1864 by brewery owner Evan Evans. The court features a stone heart set in the highest wall and an inscription which reads \"Gwrol Galon Hyd Angau\" (a brave heart till death). This emblem is that of the 17th Glamorgan Volunteer Rifle Corps and it is thought that the court may have been used as a rifle range for the volunteers’ target practice.\nIt was here in 1875 that Dr Ivor Ajax-Lewis, the handball champion for Llantrisant, defeated Mr Lovett, the champion of Neath, in a celebrated match with £1,000 in betting stakes.\nThe Nelson Court.\nThe Old Ball Court in Nelson is a three-sided handball court constructed c.1860. The unique design is based upon the earlier court at the yard of the Nelson Inn. The landlord of the Royal Oak constructed the new court to entice more customers, especially from the Nelson Inn.\nThe court elevated Nelson to a major centre for the game with all the great players of their day gracing the court accompanied by large excited crowds and much betting. The Nelson court was also famous for its annual tournaments held between May and August and accompanied by high levels of gambling. The court length was reduced in the 1990s due to safety concerns from the increasing traffic through the village.\nIn May 1995, the first European Handball Tournament was held at Nelson and was attended by American, Belgian, English, Irish, and Welsh teams. Recent notable players include Lee Davies, who was Welsh champion throughout the 1990s and became World Handball Champion in 1997.\nThe Eton Fives Yearbook (1994–95) commented:\nToday, the game remains a unique feature of the village with a seating area built for spectators in 2010."

        "text": "Sidney Jones IV (born May 21, 1996) is an American football cornerback who is a free agent. He played college football at Washington.\nEarly years.\nJones attended West Covina High School in West Covina, California. He played wide receiver, running back, cornerback and free safety. He originally committed to the University of Utah to play college football, but later flipped his commitment to the University of Washington.\nCollege career.\nJones started 12 of 13 games as a true freshman at Washington in 2014. He finished the year with 61 tackles, two interceptions and one sack. As a sophomore in 2015, Jones started all 13 games and was named first team All-Pac-12 after recording 45 tackles, four interceptions and a touchdown. On January 3, 2017 Jones announced his decision to forgo his senior season and enter the NFL Draft.\nOn March 21, 2017, Jones underwent surgery to repair a torn Achilles, an injury he suffered during pro day.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nComing out of college, Jones was projected as a first-round pick by scouts and analysts. Prior to the NFL Scouting Combine, he was ranked as the fifth-best cornerback in the draft by Pro Football Focus. He attended the combine and decided to forgo performing the bench press. On March 11, 2017, Jones participated in Washington's pro day. In the final positional drill, he suffered an Achilles injury and had to be carted off the field. The injury caused his draft stock to plummet, going from a projected first-round pick to a second- or third-round pick by draft experts and analysts. After he was injured at Washington's Pro Day, he was ranked as the ninth-best cornerback option by \"Sports Illustrated\", the 13th-best by ESPN, and the 13th-best cornerback by NFLDraftScout.com.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles selected Jones in the second round (43rd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the seventh cornerback selected in the draft. On May 11, 2017, he signed a four-year, $6.14 million contract with $3.34 million guaranteed and a signing bonus of $2.60 million. He was placed on the reserve/non-football injury list to start the season due to his Achilles injury. On December 30, 2017, Jones was activated to the 53-man roster for the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys. Jones was inactive for the playoffs, and the Eagles won Super Bowl LII 41–33 against the New England Patriots.\nIn 2018, Jones began the season as the starting nickelback for the first six games of the season. He suffered a hamstring injury in a week 6 game against the New York Giants on October 11, and missed the next three games. He returned in a week 11 game against the New Orleans Saints as the starting left cornerback, but left the game after re-aggravating his hamstring injury. He missed week 12 with the injury, and returned again the next week against the Washington Redskins as the starting left cornerback. He started the following week against the Cowboys, but left the game due to another hamstring flare up. He missed the final three regular season games and the two playoff games with his hamstring injury.\nIn 2019, Jones started the season splitting time at cornerback with Rasul Douglas for the first three games of the season. In week 2 against the Atlanta Falcons, Jones recorded his first career interception off Matt Ryan in the 24-20 loss. In week 4, Jones became a full-time starter alongside Douglas with Ronald Darby out with an injury, but suffered a hamstring injury early in the game. He missed the next week with the injury, but returned for a week 5 game against the Minnesota Vikings on October 13. Jones was healthy and active on the gameday roster in week 7, but did not play in the game. He was the main nickelback against the Buffalo Bills in week 8, but was a healthy inactive for week 9 with Avonte Maddox recovered from an injury. In week 17 against the Giants, Jones intercepted a pass thrown by rookie quarterback Daniel Jones late in the fourth quarter to seal a 34–17 Eagles' win.\nOn September 5, 2020, the Eagles waived Jones during final roster cuts after three seasons.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nOn September 8, 2020, the Jacksonville Jaguars signed Jones to their practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on September 14, 2020. In Week 5 against the Houston Texans, Jones recorded his first interception as a Jaguar off a pass thrown by Deshaun Watson during the 30–14 loss. He was placed on injured reserve on December 26, 2020.\nJones signed a contract extension with the Jaguars on March 16, 2021.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn August 31, 2021, Jones was traded to the Seattle Seahawks for a 2022 sixth-round pick.\nOn March 14, 2022, Jones re-signed with the Seahawks on a one-year deal. He was released on November 1, 2022.\nLas Vegas Raiders.\nOn November 7, 2022, the Las Vegas Raiders signed Jones to their active roster.\nCincinnati Bengals.\nOn March 27, 2023, Jones signed with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Three years later, in 1977, the first national league was created.\nThe 1994 Rwandan genocide threw the sport back, because Tutsi players, spectators and administrators died and crucial infrastructure was destroyed.\nIn the 2000s, APR was the dominant team in Rwanda and it participated in the FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup thrice. Its best result was a bronze medal in 2009.\nFrom 2011 to 2015, Espoir BBC won four straight national titles. From then, two newly established teams REG (owned by the Rwanda Energy Group) and Patriots entered the league. The two teams became rivals and played each other in the finals for several years.\nIn the 2020s, the Basketball Africa League (BAL) was introduced – the first editions were hosted by the BK Arena in Kigali. Patriots finished in fourth place in the inaugural 2021 season. The league changed its name to the Rwanda Basketball League (RBL) in 2023.

        "text": "Oman Cricket Academy Ground, also known as the Al Amerat Cricket Stadium, is a cricket ground in Al Amarat, south of Muscat, Oman. The ground is owned by the Oman Cricket Board. In January 2021, the International Cricket Council (ICC) gave accreditation for the Ministry Turf 1 at the stadium to host Test cricket.\nHistory.\nIn July 2008, Oman Cricket announced plans to construct an international-standard facility at Al Amarat, about 15 kilometres south-east of the centre of the city of Muscat. The cost of the project was initially estimated at 2 million Omani rials (US$5.2 million), with the land donated by the Ministry of Sports Affairs and the rest of the funding to be raised through corporate sponsorship. The venue, known as the Al Amerat Cricket Stadium, was inaugurated in October 2012, by Ashraful Haque, the chief executive of the Asian Cricket Council. It held its first match – a club game – two months later. Floodlights were installed at the venue in 2015, and there are plans for an indoor academy to be built, to complement the existing academy at the Sultan Qaboos Sports Complex. Oman Cricket Board later announced the construction of pavilions and an indoor state of the art training facility that also houses the HQ for Oman Cricket Board.\nThe venue hosted the 2019 ACC Western Region T20, followed by the Oman Quadrangular Series in February 2019. Matches played in both events had Twenty20 International status.\nOn 21 January 2019, in a match between the Maldives and Bahrain, the Maldivian bowler Ibrahim Hassan took the first Twenty20 International (T20I) five-wicket haul on this ground.\nOn 23 January 2019, in a match between Kuwait and Bahrain, Kuwait's Ravija Sandaruwan scored the first Twenty20 International (T20I) century on this ground.\nIn October 2019, a Pentangular T20 Series between ICC associate sides with ODI status, Oman, Ireland, Nepal and the Netherlands in addition to Hong Kong (not ODI status) was held at the venue. Home side Oman won all 4 of their matches to win the series including beating Nepal in the final game, having dismissed them for 64 runs, the lowest score ever at the stadium.\nIn November 2019, first round of Cricket World Cup Challenge League B was scheduled to take place in Hong Kong. However, citing the instability in Hong Kong, all the matches were moved to this venue.\nIn February 2020, it hosted 2020 ACC Western Region T20.\nThe stadium hosted the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup along with the UAE due to rising Covid-19 cases in India. Following the qualification to host the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, the Al Amerat Turf 1 underwent major upgrade with the addition of new floodlights and pavilions. It is expected to have a seating capacity of 4000, including VIP and VVIP seating along with dedicated commentary boxes. The scoreboard was also upgraded to a digital scoreboard. Six matches were played at the stadium during the first-round stage of the tournament, including all three of Oman's matches.\nInternational record.\nMinistry Turf 1.\nOne-Day International centuries.\nThe following table summarizes the centuries scored in ODIs at this venue.\nOne-Day International five-wicket hauls.\nThe following table summarizes the five-wicket hauls taken in ODIs at this venue.\nTwenty20 International centuries.\nTwo T20I centuries have been scored at the venue.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nThe following table summarizes the five-wicket hauls taken in T20Is at this venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International centuries.\nTwo WT20I centuries has been scored at the venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nThe following table summarizes the five-wicket hauls taken in WT20Is at this venue.\nMinistry Turf 2.\nTwenty20 International centuries.\nThree T20I centuries have been scored at the venue.\nTwenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nOne five-wicket haul has been taken in T20Is at this venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International centuries.\nTwo WT20I centuries have been scored at the venue.\nWomen's Twenty20 International five-wicket hauls.\nOne five-wicket haul has been taken in WT20Is at this venue."

        "text": "Sean Maguire (born March 11, 1994) is an American football quarterback. He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles. Maguire is a former graduate assistant at Texas A&amp;M, where he was working under his FSU coach Jimbo Fisher.\nEarly years.\nMaguire attended Seton Hall Preparatory School in West Orange, New Jersey. He was rated a four-star prospect by ESPN and a three-star quarterback by Rivals, Scout and 247Sports.com.\nCollege career.\nIn 2013, as a redshirt freshman, Maguire appeared as a third-string backup to Jameis Winston and Jacob Coker. Maguire started one game in 2014 against Clemson Tigers after Winston was suspended due to an off-the-field incident. Maguire led FSU to a 23–17 overtime victory and passed for 304 yards and a touchdown on 21-of-39 pass attempts. His 74-yard touchdown pass to Rashad Greene tied that game at 17–17 with 6:04 left in the fourth quarter. Maguire also played in the fourth quarter of the 2015 Rose Bowl.\nOn November 16, 2015, Maguire was named Florida State's starting quarterback after the position was initially held at the start of the season by Notre Dame graduate transfer Everett Golson, who had beat Maguire out for the starting position. Maguire played in eight games in 2015, including five as the starting quarterback. He posted a 4–2 record and threw for 1,520 yards with 11 touchdowns and six interceptions, completing 59.3 percent of his passes on the year. Maguire broke his ankle early in the 2015 Peach Bowl, which the Seminoles would lose to the Houston Cougars, 38–24. The Seminoles were ranked No. 9 in the AP poll prior to the Peach Bowl and dropped to No. 14 in the post-bowl poll.\nMaguire was expected to retain his positions as Florida State's starting quarterback in 2016, but he sustained a broken bone in his right foot in a preseason practice session. He had to undergo surgery to have a screw put into his foot. Maguire returned halfway through the season and was honored during Florida State's senior night in November 2016.\nProfessional career.\nMaguire was rated as the 38th best quarterback in the 2017 NFL Draft by NFLDraftScout.com.\nAfter going undrafted, he participated in rookie minicamp with the Tennessee Titans in May 2017."

Named after the Metolius River in Oregon, USA, it is headquartered in the city of Bend, Oregon.\nThe company was started in 1983 by Doug Philips in his garage. \nIt got its impetus through a group of committed climbers who came together to push their limits at Smith Rock in Oregon's high desert. \nClimbing gear available in the 1980s was limited, so they decided to design and build their own equipment, which quickly grew into a business. In 2010 Metolius is employing about 45 people in Bend, many of them climbers. Company mission statement is “by climbers for climbers”. In the last decade, some of the production like manufacturing of carabiners were moved overseas.\nPresent day.\nMetoilus is one of the leading manufacturers of climbing gear, including rock climbing, big wall and bouldering gear. In 2016 it was manufacturing wide range of climbing equipment, including: spring-loaded camming devices, climbing nuts and hexcentrics, belay devices, portaledges, harnesses, carabiners, slings, helmets, haul bags, crash pads, and artificial climbing holds."

        "title": "Rowing at the 1968 Summer Olympics – Men's eight",
        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 1968 Summer Olympics took place at Virgilio Uribe Rowing and Canoeing Course, Mexico City, Mexico. It was held from 13 to 19 October and was won by the team from West Germany, with the teams from Australia and the Soviet Union claiming silver and bronze respectively. It was West Germany's first appearance as a separate nation, though the United Team of Germany had won gold in 1960 and silver in 1964, with West Germans making up those teams. The silver medal was Australia's best result yet in the event; the nation had previously taken bronze in 1952 and 1956. The Soviet Union reached the podium in the men's eight for the first time since earning silver in 1952. Twelve teams from 12 nations attended the competition. Five of the teams replaced a total of five rowers during the competition, making for a total of 113 rowers who participated in the races.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe United States had won this event at eight of the last nine Olympics, only missing out in 1960. West Germany was one of the favourites, as they had won the last four European Championships and the last two World Championships (in 1962 and 1966). The Soviet Union had a number of silver medal placings at recent events and were also among the favourites.\nMexico made its debut in the event; East and West Germany competed separately for the first time. Canada and the United States each made their 13th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). This rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals), as well as a repechage round that allowed teams that did not win their heats to advance to the final. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nResults.\nRowers are shown as per the seats occupied in the official results book published by the Organizing Committee of the Games of the XIX Olympiad.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were rowed on 13 October. The winning teams qualified for the final, and the remaining teams progressed to the repechage.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe \"Official Report of the Organising Committee\" lists Michael Livingston in seat 7 of the United States boat, but this is incorrect, as he travelled to the 1968 Games as a reserve only. It was his elder brother, Cleve Livingston, who sat in seat 7 for the heat and final.\nRepechage.\nTwo heats were rowed in the semi-finals on 15 October. Of the five teams competing per heat, the first two would qualify for the final, while the others would progress to the small final.\nRepechage heat 1.\nIn the boat of the United States, Jake Fiechter in seat 6 replaced Cleve Livingston, who had taken seat 7 in the first round. Steve Brooks displaced Arthur Evans as stroke, with the latter moving to seat 7.\nFinals.\nFinal B.\nThe small final (now termed B final) was raced on 18 October. Great Britain replaced Malcolm Malpass in seat 5 with John Mullard in this race, and Canada replaced John Richardson in seat 5 with Daryl Sturdy. Mexico changed the seats for all rowers apart from the cox, and East Germany changed four of the seats. The Netherlands changed all seats apart from the stroke and the cox.\nFinal A.\nThe final (now termed A final) was raced on 19 October. On the morning of the race, the West German team replaced Roland Böse—who was suffering from angina pectoris and had developed a fever—with Niko Ott in seat 8. The team from Czechoslovakia replaced Milan Hurtala (seat 2) with Karel Kolesa (seat 4), and all the remaining rowers apart from the cox took different seats in the final compared to the two previous races. The team from the United States replaced Arthur Evans with Cleve Livingston in seat 7.\nAfter the medal ceremony, Ott gave his gold medal to Böse, but another medal was later minted for Ott. As per convention, the Olympic results database lists Böse as a medallist based on the fact that he competed in the qualifying race."

It was held from 18 to 25 July and was won by the team from East Germany.\nBackground.\nThe East German team was the undisputed favourite going into this event. Over the last few years, their rowers had won this class at almost all major regattas. After West Germany won the inaugural world championships in 1962, East Germany won all subsequent events in 1966, 1970, and 1974. Of the last four European Rowing Championships (the event was discontinued after 1973), they won gold in three of four of the events (1967, 1971, and 1973), and bronze in 1969. Other favourites included the Soviet Union and West Germany.\nResults.\nHeats.\nHeat 3.\nThe five teams in heat 3 of the elimination round eventually took the first five places in the A final.\nRepechage.\nThe Norwegian and Argentinian teams changed three seats. The teams from Canada, Romania, and Finland changed all four seats.\nSemifinals.\nHeat 1.\nThe East German team swapped seats 3 and 4. The teams from Great Britain and Bulgaria swapped all four seats.\nHeat 2.\nThe teams from the Soviet Union and Belgium changed all four seats. West Germany replaced Klaus Meyer with Klaus Roloff, and only the stroke remained in his seat. Italy changed three seats.\nFinals.\nB final.\nThe Bulgarian team changed three of the seats.\nA final.\nFor the second time, the Soviet Union changed all four seats. The New Zealand team changed all four seats. The Canadians changed three seats. As expected, East Germany won the gold medal; they had dominated all their races and won their qualifying heat 12 seconds faster than the other heats. The surprise winner of the silver medal was the team from Norway, who left the much more highly rated Soviet Union with bronze."

The contents of the heritage centre were secured by the charity Rugby League Cares with the aid of a £97,200 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund.\nRugby League Cares used the grant to organise a touring exhibition \"Rugby League Heritage On Tour\" which has shown parts of the collection at various venues across the United Kingdom since 2014.\nIn March 2016 Rugby League Cares announced that Kevin Moore, director of the National Football Museum would lead a feasibility study into establishing a new national museum for rugby league as well providing a home for the Rugby League Hall of Fame. The location of the museum was announced in September 2016 as Bradford City Hall, in conjunction with Bradford City Council. However, in 2020, this proposal was dropped, with instead a new plan to incorporate the museum into the disused George Hotel, Huddersfield, where the Rugby Football League was originally founded in 1895.\nOpening.\nThe museum plans to open in August 2020, the 125th anniversary of the formation of the sport."

        "text": "Samuel Henley (born 25 July 1993) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey forward. He played as a prospect for the Colorado Avalanche of the National Hockey League (NHL).\nPlaying career.\nAs a youth, Henley played in the 2006 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with the Val d'Or Foreurs minor ice hockey team.\nJunior.\nHenley first played midget hockey within Quebec QMAAA with the Amos Forestiers, appearing in 13 games with 5 points before he was selected by the Lewiston MAINEiacs in the third-round, 39th overall, in the QMJHL Entry Draft. He played his first junior ice hockey campaign in the 2009–10 season, collected 4 goals in 63 games as a depth forward. After two seasons with Lewiston, Henley was selected in the dispersal draft of the Maineiacs to play with his hometown team, the Val d'Or Foreurs, joining brother and Buffalo Sabres 2010 draft pick, Cedrick Henley.\nIn his first season in Val d'Or in 2011–12, Henley matched his previous seasons' total of 13 goals for 27 points in 63 games. Added to the leadership group in his second year with the Foreurs, Henley adjusted his role from a depth player to a two-way force with 45 points in 58 games. Prior to his final junior season, Henley attended the Washington Capitals training camp before returning to be selected as the Captain of the Foreurs for the 2013–14 season. He broke out offensively with 30 goals and 69 points in just 51 games, leading the Val d'Or Foreurs to claim their third President's Cup in franchise history and earning a place at the 2014 Memorial Cup.\nProfessional.\nHenley was promptly signed as an undrafted free agent to a three-year entry-level contract with the Colorado Avalanche on 29 May 2014. After attending his first training camp with the Avalanche, Henley was reassigned to begin his professional career in the 2014–15 season, with the Lake Erie Monsters of the AHL. As the Monsters' primarily fourth-line center and penalty-killer, he contributed with 6 goals and 10 points in 54 games. Henley solidified his reputation for his defensive and shutdown capabilities in the following season, improving his points totals with 8 goals and 15 points in 74 games for the Avalanche's new AHL affiliate, the San Antonio Rampage.\nIn the final year of his entry-level contract, Henley began the 2016–17 season, with the Rampage. On 1 December 2016, with the Avalanche depleted through injury, Henley received his first recall to the NHL. He made his debut with the Avalanche that night from the Avalanche's fourth-line and became the first player since Stefan Elliott in 2011 to score in his Avalanche debut, contributing a tying goal against Sergei Bobrovsky in an eventual 3–2 defeat to the Columbus Blue Jackets. He was later returned to the Rampage without adding to his solitary game. Having returned to the Rampage, Henley played out the season as an Alternate captain but was unable to match his previous season totals in contributing with just 3 goals and 9 points in 55 games.\nOn 26 June 2017, Henley as a restricted free agent, was not tendered a qualifying contract by the Colorado Avalanche, thus releasing him to free agency. Despite multiple contract offers over the summer, Henley opted to take a one-year sabbatical from professional hockey."

        "text": "Christian Hunter Greene (born August 6, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds of Major League Baseball (MLB). The Reds selected him second overall in the 2017 MLB Draft.\nBorn in Los Angeles, California, Greene learned how to pitch at the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy in Compton. His fastball velocity was already during his first year at Notre Dame High School, and by the time he graduated in 2017, it was up to . The Reds drafted Greene out of high school, and he joined their farm system rather than playing college baseball. Greene suffered an ulnar collateral ligament injury partway through the 2018 season and underwent Tommy John surgery the following year. The COVID-19 pandemic kept him from pitching for another year, but once he returned in 2021, he quickly rose through the minor leagues.\nGreene made the Reds' Opening Day roster in 2022. In only the second game of his major league career, he set an MLB record by throwing 39 pitches with a velocity of at least .\nEarly life.\nGreene was born on August 6, 1999, in Los Angeles, California. His mother Senta worked as an educational consultant, while his father Russell worked as a private investigator for Johnnie Cochran. In 2007, when he was seven years old, he joined the Major League Baseball Urban Youth Academy in Compton, California. Greene learned how to pitch at the instructional facility and appeared in several youth showcase events hosted by Major League Baseball (MLB), such as the Junior Home Run Derby at the 2016 MLB All-Star Game at Petco Park.\nAt Notre Dame High School in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, Greene played shortstop when he was not pitching. His fastball velocity was at during his freshman season, and by his senior year, he was pitching up to . Over four high school baseball seasons, Greene had a career 1.62 earned run average (ERA) in innings pitched, striking out over 30 percent of the batters he faced. This included a senior season in which he had a 3–0 win–loss record and 0.75 ERA in five appearances, striking out 43 batters and walking four in 28 innings. Offensively, Greene batted .324 with six home runs, 28 runs batted in (RBI), six doubles, two triples, 23 runs scored, a .374 on-base percentage, and a .598 slugging percentage. In April 2017, Greene became the 13th high school athlete to appear on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\", and the first high school baseball player since Bryce Harper in 2009.\nProfessional career.\nDraft and minor leagues (2017–2021).\nDespite media projections that Greene would be the first overall pick in the 2017 MLB draft, the Minnesota Twins selected Royce Lewis, and Greene was instead taken second overall by the Cincinnati Reds. Greene, who had been committed to play college baseball for the UCLA Bruins since he was a freshman in high school, ultimately agreed to a professional contract with the Reds only a few minutes before the 2 p.m. (PDT) signing deadline on July 7. His $7.23 million signing bonus was the highest of any player since the draft slot system was overhauled in 2012 and the highest of any player since Gerrit Cole signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 2011 for $8 million. Once he signed with the Reds, Greene was assigned to the Billings Mustangs, their farm system team in the Rookie-level Pioneer League. Primarily used as a pitcher, Greene also saw time as a designated hitter on days when he did not pitch. He started in three games for the Mustangs, going 0–1 with a 12.46 ERA in the process while striking out six batters in innings. At the plate, he batted .233 with three RBI in 30 at bats across 10 games.\nGreene had difficulty adjusting to the older, more experienced hitters he faced in the Midwest League: in his first five starts, his ERA was 13.97, and opposing hitters batted .420 against him. He improved with coaching, however, with a nine-game stretch in which he pitched to a 2.78 ERA and struck out 54 batters in innings before pitching in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game. Greene's 2018 season came to an end at the start of August when he sprained the ulnar collateral ligament of his right elbow. He made 18 starts for Dayton before the injury, during which he went 3–7 with a 4.48 ERA and 89 strikeouts. The Reds medical staff had hoped that the injury would improve through nonsurgical rehabilitation, but in March 2019, Greene suffered a setback, and he underwent Tommy John surgery to repair the ligament.\nGreene, like other MLB prospects, did not pitch in 2020 either, as the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of the Minor League Baseball season. When he returned to professional baseball in 2021, he was assigned to the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern League. He made seven starts there, during which he went 5–0 with a 1.98 ERA and struck out 60 batters in 41 innings, before receiving a promotion to the Triple-A Louisville Bats on June 15. Greene started 14 games after the promotion, during which he went 5–8 with a 4.13 ERA and struck out 79 batters in innings. The Reds put Greene on an innings limit for the season, and he was shut down on September 17 after pitching innings. Between Chattanooga and Louisville, Greene had a 3.30 ERA and 139 strikeouts for the season. That November, the Reds added Greene to their 40-man roster to protect him from being taken in the Rule 5 draft.\nCincinnati Reds (2022–present).\nAfter impressing coaches during spring training, Greene made the Reds' Opening Day roster for the 2022 MLB season. He made his major league debut on April 10, earning the win in a 6–3 Cincinnati victory over defending World Series champions the Atlanta Braves. Greene allowed three earned runs on four hits while striking out seven batters over five innings. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers on April 17 for his second start, Greene set an MLB record by throwing 39 pitches at speeds of or higher. The previous record was set by Jacob deGrom of the New York Mets, who threw 33 pitches at that velocity on June 5, 2021. Despite this performance, the Reds lost the game 5–2. Greene had a difficult start to his major league career, going 1–5 with a 7.62 ERA and allowing 11 home runs in his first six starts. He improved over his next six games, going 2–2 with a 3.18 ERA while allowing only four home runs. On August 1, Greene pitched six scoreless innings against the Miami Marlins. It was his third outing in which he pitched at least six innings, struck out eight or more batters while allowing no more than one hit, a record for rookie pitchers in the live-ball era. Four days later, Greene, who had previously experienced arm fatigue during his starts, was placed on the injured list with a right shoulder strain.\nIn 2023, Greene posted a 3.93 ERA across 14 starts before he was placed on the injured list with right hip pain on June 19, 2023. He was transferred to the 60–day injured list on July 31, and began a rehab assignment with the Arizona Complex League Reds the following day. On August 20, Greene was activated ahead of a scheduled start against the Toronto Blue Jays.\nNational team career.\nGreene first represented the United States in international competition at the 2014 U-15 Baseball World Cup in Mexico. He struck out four batters and allowed one unearned run on three hits in his first outing, a 14–2 rout of Panama. Greene took the win in the game, while his fastball reached . Greene and the US team were only silver medalists, however, as Cuba defeated Team USA 10–2 in the championship match. Greene lasted only two innings in this final outing, allowing three runs on three hits while striking out two.\nThe year after his silver medal performance at the U15 tournament, Greene once again represented the United States at the 2015 U-18 Baseball World Cup in Japan. Greene and the rest of Team USA won the gold medal in a 2–1 championship victory over the host team.\nPitcher profile.\nGreene's primary pitch is his four-seam fastball. It typically averages around , but has reached radar gun speeds up to in minor leagues. His breaking balls are a slider and a changeup. While he was in the Reds' farm system, there was some concern over Greene's ability to develop an off-speed pitch to complement his fastball. He stopped throwing a curveball in order to focus on his slider, and his command improved as he progressed through the minor leagues. His changeup was not as developed when Greene made his major league debut, with Fangraphs rating the pitch only a 40 out of 80.\nPersonal life.\nGreene and his family live in Stevenson Ranch, California. He has two younger siblings, a sister named Libriti and a brother named Ethan. Libriti was diagnosed with leukemia when she was five years old, but went into remission four years later. Outside of baseball, Greene enjoys painting and playing the violin."

The Dragons, led by 1st year head coach John Marino, played their home games at Curtis Hall Gym.\nDue to wartime, the Drexel varsity men's basketball team was replaced with the Drexel men's junior varsity (or \"frosh\") team. This team is presumed to be the Drexel Dragons men's basketball team for the 1943–44 season for record keeping purposes. Following the season, it was expected that most, if not all, of the players from this team, including the head coach, would ever return to the team again due to joining the armed forces in World War II. The schedule for the season was essentially made as the season went on, with few games scheduled before the season began.\nDuring the season, a mixed team of civilians and cadets (3318th S.U.) that were stationed on the Drexel University campus formed, called the Drexel ASTU. The team attempted to form the previous season, however had trouble composing a schedule when they learned they would only be allowed to face teams that were also ASTP teams. This team was coached by Maury McMains, who was the director of the physical training program for the cadets. When McMains was unavailable, Gene Carney (A-3) assumed coaching responsibilities as a player-coach. While the team was at a disadvantage due to a lack of practice, members of the team included former college basketball players and other experienced basketball players. The Drexel ASTU men left the campus in April after being recalled.\nSchedule.\nDrexel J.V.

        "title": "Bill Winters (American football)",
        "text": "Bill Winters (born William Randolph Kahl-Winter on July 22, 1954) is an American former professional football offensive lineman who played in the National Football League (NFL), Canadian Football League (CFL), American Football Association (AFA), and United States Football League (USFL) for eight seasons during the 1970s and 1980s. He played college football for Princeton University, and thereafter he played professionally for the Washington Redskins and New York Giants of the NFL, the Montreal Alouettes and BC Lions of the CFL, the Orlando Americans and Carolina Storm of the AFA, and the Tampa Bay Bandits, San Antonio Gunslingers, and Portland Breakers of the USFL.\nEarly life.\nWinters was born in Asbury Park in the Wanamassa section of Ocean Township, Monmouth County, New Jersey. He grew up in nearby Tinton Falls and played high school football, basketball, and baseball for the Monmouth Regional High School Golden Falcons. He was an All-Shore and All-County selection as a three-year quarterback for the team and won the prestigious Thom McAn Scholar Athlete Award for Monmouth County his senior year. He also played catcher on the baseball team and forward on the basketball team.\nCollege career.\nWinters received a full academic scholarship to Princeton University, where he graduated with a A.B. in History and a teaching certification in Social Studies. He lettered for the Princeton Tigers, starting out as a quarterback and then moving to tight end where he played his freshman, sophomore, and junior years. His senior year, he played tight end and offensive tackle.\nProfessional career.\nUpon graduation, Winters attended a free agent tryout camp, and earned a contract as an offensive lineman with George Allen's Washington Redskins in 1976, but was released in training camp. In 1977, he signed with new head coach John McVay and the New York Giants, receiving a $5,000 bonus. He suffered a ruptured appendix on July 26 due to dehydration after playing more than sixty five plays in 95 degree heat during a controlled offensive scrimmage against the New York Jets. Winters was expected to make the final roster, with McVay stating on August 9 that \"We're going to keep a spot open on our final roster for him,\" and \"That's how much we think of him.\" On August 17, Winters was placed on the non-football related injury list by the Giants in the hopes of being activated onto the roster once healthy, but developed an infection (peritonitis) keeping him out for the remainder of the season.\nWinters was released the following year in training camp on August 15, and picked up on a five-day trial by the Montreal Alouettes of the CFL. He went on to start for head coach Joe Scannella at right tackle for the remainder of the season, which included six of the next eight regular season games, two playoff games, and the 66th Grey Cup. The following year, he was traded to the BC Lions during training camp and played in one preseason game for head coach Vic Rapp but suffered a knee injury during it. The injury required surgery and resulted in him being placed on injured reserve for the season. He spent the 1980 season rehabilitating his knee and started a career as a financial consultant, and legally shortened his name to Bill Winters. He went on to play two full seasons in the AFA, starting twelve games at center for the Orlando Americans in 1981, and thirteen games at right guard and right tackle for the Carolina Storm in 1982. The Storm went undefeated at 13–0 and won the American Bowl league championship that year.\nIn 1983, Winters signed on with John F. Bassett's Tampa Bay Bandits in the newly emerging USFL, where he started eleven of the team's first twelve games at left guard for head coach Steve Spurrier before sustaining a stress fracture of his right leg, ending his season. He was waived in training camp the following year in 1984, but recalled by the Bandits off waivers after the first regular season game. He was then waived again three games into the regular season, but was claimed by the San Antonio Gunslingers of the USFL, where he started thirteen of the last fourteen games at center for head coach Gil Steinke in their inaugural season. He also did the snapping for field goals and extra points. In 1985, he was traded in the off-season to the Portland Breakers where he rejoined his former line coach from San Antonio Mike Barry. He went on to play eighteen games for the Breakers, starting one game at right guard for head coach Dick Coury. The following year Winters was to sign and play for the Orlando Renegades of the USFL and head coach Lee Corso but the USFL ceased operations and Winters retired from professional football.\nLife after football.\nWinters has worked as a financial consultant and insurance agent through the years, and continues to do it part-time. In addition, he has done some acting and voice over work, writing and some coaching. He authored a book called \"From the Outhouse to the Penthouse and Somewhere in Between: The Story of One Free Agent's Trip Through the Ranks of Pro Football\". He is a lifetime member of the National Football League Players Association and a member of the Screen Actors Guild. After serving as a teacher for 9 years and a coach for 4 years in the Spring Independent School District in Houston, Texas, where he helped coach the Spring Dekaney High School Wildcats to the 2011 5A Division II State Football Championship, he resigned his position to pursue new opportunities."

The Bulldogs represented Yale University and were coached by Keith Allain, in his 11th season.\nSeason.\nDespite losing two of its best defensive players to graduation, Yale entered the season ranked. After a bad week in mid-November, however, the team found itself outside of the top-20 and it quickly sank to the bottom of the conference. After finishing 3rd in the Shillelagh Tournament, Yale clawed its way back up to a .500 record and then promptly lost back-to-back matches to ranked teams.\nAfter the disappointing start, Yale began the new year more focused and put together a strong stretch in the month of January. The Bulldogs went 6–1–2 with ties against #16 St. Lawrence and #6 Harvard, putting them in contention for the NCAA Tournament. In February, however, their fortunes reversed and the team won just one of its last eight games, finishing 8th in ECAC Hockey.\nWhen the conference tournament began, Yale's only chance of reaching the national tournament was a conference championship. The team took care of business in the first round with a pair of wins over Dartmouth, which set up a showdown with arch-rival Harvard. By then the Crimson had risen to #2 in the country but they got a tougher challenge than they were expecting from the Bulldogs. Yale scored six goals in two games, but their defense wasn't able to hold back Harvard's attack. The Bulldogs dropped both games and abruptly ended a once-promising season.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#00356B\" | "

        "text": "The men's coxed four (M4+) competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place at the rowing basin on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was held from 18 to 25 July and was won by the team from Soviet Union. There were 14 boats (71 competitors, with the Soviet Union making one substitution) from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The victory was the Soviet Union's first medal in the men's coxed four. East Germany took its third consecutive silver medal, with entirely different crews each time. The defending champion West Germany received bronze this time. Hans-Johann Färber, the only rower from the 1972 gold medal team to return, became the fifth man to earn multiple medals in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 15th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nWhile West Germany had won the previous Olympic event in 1972, the Soviet Union had since won most of the relevant competitions: the 1973 European Rowing Championships (the event was discontinued after 1973) and the 1975 World Rowing Championships. In the 1974 World Rowing Championships, the Soviet Union won silver. East Germany had won silver at the 1972 Summer Olympics and had since won silver at the 1973 European Rowing Championships, gold at the 1974 World Rowing Championships, and silver in the following year. West Germany had not made the A final at the 1973 European Rowing Championships, but had won bronze at both the subsequent world championships. The only other country that had won medals in these events was Czechoslovakia, having won bronze in both 1972 and 1973.\nBulgaria and Ireland each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 13th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe tournament used the four-round format (three main rounds and a repechage) that had been used in 1968. The competition continued to use the six-boat heat standardised in 1960 as well as the \"B\" final for ranking 7th through 12th place introduced in 1964.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThree heats were rowed on 18 July. Two of the heats had five teams and one had four teams, with the first three teams to qualify for the semifinals, and the remaining teams progressing to the repechage.\nRepechage.\nOne heat was rowed in the repechage on 20 July. Of the five teams competing, the first three progressed to the semifinals. Poland swapped seats 2 and 4 for this race. The team from Bulgaria swapped three of the seats for the repechage. Italy swapped seats 1 to 3. Norway swapped seats 2 to 4. Argentina and Norway were eliminated in the repechage.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were rowed in the semifinals on 23 July. Of the six teams competing per heat, the first three would qualify for the A final, while the others would progress to the B final.\nSemifinal 1.\nEast Germany swapped the seats of all four rowers. The New Zealanders swapped seats 2 and 4. The United States swapped seats 2 to 4. The Dutch changed the seats of all four rowers. The French team swapped the stroke with seat 3.\nSemifinal 2.\nThe team from the Soviet Union replaced Aleksandr Sema with Mikhail Kuznetsov. The team from West Germany swapped seats 2 and 3. Ireland swapped rowers in seats 1, 2, and 4.\nFinals.\nThe two finals were rowed on 25 July.\nFinal B.\nIn the B final, the Dutch team changed seats 2 to 4. The team from the USA swapped the stroke with seat 4.\nFinal A.\nThe team from the Soviet Union swapped rowers in seats 3 and 4. The East German Dießner twins swapped their seats. The Czechoslovakian, Bulgarian, and New Zealand teams changed seats for all four rowers."

The following year it was inducted into the \"SNNVS Russia\" and followed with becoming a full-member of the Rugby League European Federation on the 22 February 2013 and the Rugby League International Federation on the 8 August 2013.\nIn March 2022, the body had its membership with the IRL and ERL suspended due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. In March 2024, while still being suspended, the body was downgraded to affiliate member due to noncompliance with the full membership criteria.\nCompetitions.\nAs of 2016 the ARLC administrated the \"Rugby League Tournament\" (ТУРНИР ПО РЕГБИ ЛИГ) and a number of conference leagues. \nThe 2016 season consists of the following sides: \n- RK CSKA, Moscow \n- RC Dynamo, Moscow \n- RK Fili, Fili \n- Lokomotiv, Moscow \n- RK NARA, Naro-Fominsk \n- RK Polar Bears, Moscow \n- RLC Storm, Moscow \n- Vereya Bears, Vereya \nNational Championship results.\n Soviet Championship \n1990 - Moscow Magicians \n1991 - Tiraspol Aeolis \n CIS Championship \n1992 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n1993 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n1994 - Moscow Magicians \n1995 - Kazan Arrows \n1996 - \n1997 -\n Russian Championship \n1998 - Kazan Arrows \n1999 - Kazan Arrows \n2000 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2001 - Kazan Arrows \n2002 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2003 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2004 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2005 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2006 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2007 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2008 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2009 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2010 - \n2011 - \n2012 - \n2013- Vereya Bears \n2014 - RC Lokomotiv Moscow \n2015 - Vereya Bears"

        "title": "2001 Belmont Stakes",
        "text": "The 2001 Belmont Stakes was the 133rd running of the Belmont Stakes. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown series, was held on June 9, 2001, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nPoint Given, trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Gary Stevens, was one of the most highly regarded three-year-olds of his era. Although he finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby, he rebounded to win the Preakness Stakes. In the Belmont Stakes, he turned in a dominating performance to win by over 12 lengths in one of the fastest times in the history of the race.\nPre-race.\nIn jockey Gary Steven's opinion, Point Given was one of the best horse of the 2000s and a worthy inductee to the Hall of Fame in 2010. He attributed Point Given's fifth-place finish in the Derby to the combination of a foot infection and a very firm track at Churchill Downs. On a deeper track with more cushion, the foot did not bother the colt and trainer Bob Baffert remembered being very confident. \"He's the best one I've ever led over for the Belmont\", he said in 2010. \"I knew he'd handle the distance. They can either go that far or they can't. You can't train that into them.\"\nOne week before the Belmont, Point Given's \"mischievous\" antics gave cause for concern when he injured himself in his stall. He suffered a cut over the eye, then the medication made him start acting colicky so Baffert withheld his hay to avoid making the stomach problems worse. The colt reacted by crawling under the webbing in his stall, gashing himself in the side in the process. He was briefly loose from his stall, but was then caught by the grooms.\nEight other horses entered the race. Point Given's main rivals were considered to be Derby winner Monarchos and Preakness runner-up A P Valentine. A P Valentine had won two of two starts at Belmont Park including the Champagne Stakes, in which he had defeated Point Given.\nThe attendance was 73,857, the highest for the Belmont when a Triple Crown was not at stake.\nRace description.\nPoint Given broke well and settled in third place just behind the early leaders. After the first half-mile went in a reasonable 48 seconds, Point Given picked up the pace slightly and moved to the lead. He continued to draw away, encouraged by Stevens who remembered being run down late with Silver Charm in a previous running of the race. Point Given won by lengths and finished in 2:26.56, equal to the fourth fastest Belmont ever. \"He actually was idling with me a little and I thought somebody had to be coming,\" said Stevens. \"I didn't know how far in front I was at the eighth pole and I didn't care. I knew he was going to get a rest afterward, and it was important for everybody to see how good he is.\"\nHis connections had mixed emotions about the win. \"I'm always going to be bittersweet about these two victories without a victory in the Kentucky Derby,\" Stevens said. \"I'm not going to get greedy, but I feel like he's a champion and should have a Triple Crown next to his name.\"\nA P Valentine finished second, lengths ahead of Monarchos. His trainer Nick Zito said, \"My horse ran his heart out again, but that other horse is in another zone.\"\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: — 0:23.95; — 0:48.00; — 1:11.78; mile — 1:35.56; — 2:00.75; final — 2:26.56.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.95) (:24.05) (:23.78) (:23.78) (:25.00) (:25.80)\nPayout.\nThe 135th Belmont Payout Schedule"

        "text": "The 2016–17 Southern Jaguars basketball team represented Southern University during the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Jaguars, led by sixth-year head coach Roman Banks, played their home games at the F. G. Clark Center in Baton Rouge, Louisiana as members of the Southwestern Athletic Conference.

        "text": "The Catholic University Cardinals men's basketball team represents The Catholic University of America in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III college basketball competition as a member of the Landmark Conference. They won the national championship in the 2000–2001 season, and are the only program in Division III to reach the Sweet Sixteen five consecutive seasons, from 1998 to 2002.\nHistory.\nThe team began as a club sport in the 1909–10 season, and gained varsity status the following year. Although it did not have an official head coach, the roster listed Joseph Bollin as the team's \"manager.\" The first game during the club sport era was against Georgetown University, and the first official game was a 42–33 home victory over Gallaudet University on January 7, 1911. They followed it with a 37–34 victory over St. John's College in Annapolis, but lost the remaining six games of the season to finish 2–6.\nFred Rice, a graduate student, joined the team in the 1911–12 season as a player coach. Rice had previously played at Georgetown, where he earned a law degree. The team improved to 10–7, and then 13–3 in 1912–13.\nThe December 1916 edition of The Catholic University of America Bulletin declared that, under Rice's leadership,\nThe Brookland Gymnasium, the first on-campus arena, opened in 1924. The team won their first two games in it, and went 38–15 from 1925 to '28.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe 1943–44 men's basketball team won the Mason-Dixon Conference title and made the program's first trip to the NCAA Tournament. The team played in Madison Square Garden, losing to Dartmouth and Temple. \nThe 1963–64 season, Catholic played the NCAA College Division (Division II) Tournament at Hofstra, losing to Hofstra and Philadelphia. \nThe men's basketball team won the 2001 NCAA Division III National Championship and was the only program in Division III to reach the Sweet Sixteen five consecutive seasons, from 1998 to 2002. They also reached the postseason in 1993, 1996, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2024."

        "title": "2017 English cricket season",
        "text": "The 2017 English cricket season was the 118th in which the County Championship had been an official competition. The season, which began on 28 March and ended on 29 September, featured two global one-day competitions played in England and Wales, the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy and the 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup. England Women's team won the World Cup, defeating India in the final at Lord's. Pakistan beat India in the Champions Trophy final.\nThe season included men's international tours of England by South Africa and West Indies. England played four Test matches against South Africa and three against West Indies. Both teams also played One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) series against England, whilst Ireland played a two ODI series against England.\nThe season also saw the first-class counties compete in the 2017 County Championship, 2017 Royal London One-Day Cup and 2017 NatWest t20 Blast competitions. Essex won the County Championship, and Nottinghamshire won both limited overs competitions. Lancashire Women won both the Women's County Championship and the Women's Twenty20 Cup. In the second season of the Women's Cricket Super League, the title was won by Western Storm, who defeated Southern Vipers in the final. The Minor Counties competed for the 2017 Minor Counties Championship and MCCA Knockout Trophy, both of which were won by Berkshire. Club and recreational cricket was played throughout both countries.\nChampions Trophy.\nThe 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was held in England and Wales in June. Eight international men's teams competed in the tournament, which was won by Pakistan who defeated India in the final at The Oval. Group stage matches were played at The Oval, Edgbaston and at Sophia Gardens in Cardiff.\nWomen's World Cup.\nThe 2017 Women's Cricket World Cup was held in England in June and July. Eight international women's teams competed in the tournament on a round-robin basis. The top four teams after the round-robin stage qualified for semi-finals with the two winners reaching the final. England beat India in the final which was held at Lord's, and was a sell-out.\nInternational tours.\nThree international men's sides toured England during the season: Ireland, South Africa and West Indies. The Irish tour was a two ODI series, whilst the other tours all featured Test cricket as well as ODI and T20I matches. There were no women's tours to England during the season.\nIreland tour.\nThe Irish team played two ODIs against England in early May in advance of the Champions Trophy. England won both matches.\nSouth Africa tour.\nThe tour by South Africa included matches played either side of the Champions Trophy. In late May, immediately before the start of the Champions Trophy, a three match ODI series was played, with England winning the series 2–1. After the tournament a three-match T20I series was played, England again winning 2–1.\nThe four match Test series between the two teams took place between the beginning of July and early August. England won the series 3–1.\nWest Indies tour.\nThe West Indies toured England in August and September. Three Test matches were played, England winning the series 2–1. The series included the first day-night Test match to be played in England. A single T20I and a five match ODI series were played after the Tests, England winning the ODI series 4–0 whilst West Indies won the T20I. The final match of the ODI series was played on 29 September and was the final match played during the season.\nDomestic cricket.\nMCCU Matches.\nThe season began with three rounds of first-class cricket matches played between first-class counties and the six MCC University sides. Each MCCU side played two matches, each against a first class county, between 28 March and 9 April.\nCounty Championship.\nThe men's County Championship saw a restructuring of the divisional structure for the start of the season. Division One was reduced to eight teams at the end of the 2016 season in order to reduce the number of Championship matches each county played to 14. Ten teams competed in Division Two for the first time, meaning that Division Two sides did not play each other home and away during the season.\nEssex, who had been promoted from Division Two the previous season, won the County Championship. Middlesex, the 2016 Champions, and Warwickshire were relegated from Division One, with their places taken by Division Two champions Worcestershire and Nottinghamshire, who narrowly beat Northamptonshire to the second place spot in the division.\nMiddlesex's relegation from Division One was controversial. The club had been deducted two points for bowling a slow over rate during a match against Surrey at The Oval at the end of August in a match which was abandoned early when a crossbow bolt was fired on to the pitch. At the time Middlesex were batting but could have declared and made up the over rate in Surrey's second innings. They lost to Somerset on the final day of the season, with Somerset just one point above Middlesex in the table. The pitch at Taunton was investigated after Wayne Noon, the ECB cricket liaison officer at the ground for the match, marked it as \"below average\" for excessive spin on the first two days of the match – a factor which, it was suggested, would help Somerset's strong spin attack. No action was taken over the pitch quality after a further inspection took place, despite it being described as \"doctored\" and Somerset being called a \"disgrace\" by Middlesex's Chief Executive Angus Fraser. Middlesex subsequently appealed the decision to deduct the two points for the slow over rate at The Oval but the appeal was rejected by the ECB.\nRoyal London One-Day Cup.\nThe Royal London One-Day Cup took place between April and July, with the eighteen counties organised into two regional groups. Nottinghamshire and Surrey advanced to the final, with Nottinghamshire winning the title.\nNatWest t20 Blast.\nThe T20 Blast took place between July and September, with the eighteen counties organised into two regional groups. Nottinghamshire beat Warwickshire in the final to claim their second title of the season.\nWomen's County Championship.\nThe Women's County Championship was won by Lancashire, the county's first Championship title. The runners-up were Yorkshire. The season was the first with a changed format of three divisions with Division Three split into four geographic groups, replacing the previous system of four divisions.\nWomen's Twenty20 Cup.\nThe Women's Twenty20 Cup was won by Lancashire, the county's first Twenty20 title. Middlesex finished as runners-up.\nWomen's Cricket Super League.\nThe second edition of the Women's Cricket Super League took place in August and September. The final was a repeat of the previous season, but this time Western Storm beat defending champions Southern Vipers by 7 wickets.\nMinor Counties Championship.\nThe 3-day Minor Counties Championship ended in August, with Berkshire beating Lincolnshire in the final. Berkshire also won the 50-over MCCA Knockout Trophy."

In June 1881 it also hosted Leicestershire County Cricket Club against an All England XI. The ground was situated a mile north of the town and opened in 1880, it was short-lived as a ground though, and was closed in 1901 when houses, shops and part of the British United Shoe Machinery were built on the site. Now the area is bordered by Roberts Road, Buller Road, and Macdonald Road.\nThe ground was opened on 5 May 1880 by Edwyn Sherard Burnaby, the MP for Leicestershire North, as a 10-acre site with mile long running and cycling tracks, cricket and football pitches and hosted Leicester Tigers first official game against Moseley on 23 October of that year.\nThe ground was enclosed which allowed a gate to be taken. However this harmed the ability to build a following, so Tigers moved to Victoria Park in January 1881. The rugby club moved back for the 1882/83 season before reverting yet again to Victoria Park. Leicester Fosse, a forerunner of Leicester City played soccer at the ground for the 1887/88 season, their fourth, however only lasted one season before being outbid for the use of the ground by Leicester Tigers.\nTigers played at the ground until leaving for Welford Road in 1892.\nTigers Record"

Each discipline had an Elite Men and an Elite Women category. There were also men's and women's under-23 categories in the XCO and junior men's and women's categories in the DHI. The cross-country series had six rounds and the downhill series had seven rounds.\nThe Cross-Country Eliminator (XCE) was included as a UCI World Cup discipline for the first time since 2014. The XCE schedule for 2017 had six rounds.

John was banned from\nsnooker until 21 December 2023 after being found guilty of match fixing by the WPBSA in February 2019.\nCareer.\nEarly years.\nJohn drew attention in 2000 by reaching the quarter-finals at the European Under-19 Championship. His first major success occurred in 2002 when he won the EBSA European Championship after defeating David McLellan 7–2, he continued this success at amateur level for the remainder of the year and reached the final of the IBSF World Under-21 Snooker Championship lost but 9–11 against China's Ding Junhui.\nFor the 2002–03 snooker season John joined the main tour. In the first world ranking tournament of the season, the 2002 LG Cup, John secured a 5–3 win against Andrew Higginson before being eliminated in the following round by Martin Dziewialtowski. After this John struggled for much of the season with his best performance of the season came in the 2003 Welsh Open where John reached the third qualifying round before losing 4–5 to future World Champion Mark Selby in a final frame decider. John finished the season ranked 111th .\nIn June 2003, John defeated fellow countryman Andrew Pagett 7–3 to retain the EBSA European Championship, becoming the first person to do so. As of 2022, John, Robin Hull and Maltese player Alex Borg are the only players to have won the EBSA European Championship consecutively.\nAmateur years.\nHaving dropped off of the tour at the end of the 2002–03 snooker season John spent the next 13 years playing as an amateur. During this time he twice won the Welsh Amateur Championship.\nIn June 2015, John entered Australian Goldfields Open, defeating world number 44 Alfie Burden in the first qualifying round 5–1. Although he was ultimately defeated by Peter Lines by the same score in the following round, this performance encouraged John that he could still make a full-time return to the game at a professional level.\nReturn to professional status.\nAfter a 13-year absence John earned a place on the main tour by coming through the 2016 Q School. He beat Zak Surety 4–1 in the final round of the second event to secure a two-year tour card.\nIn May 2018 he was suspended from the tour for suspected match fixing, although he had not accrued enough ranking points to stay on the main tour in any case."

        "title": "John Ross (American football)",
        "text": "John Ellis Ross III (born November 27, 1995) is a former American football wide receiver. He played college football at Washington and was selected ninth overall by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2017 NFL Draft. His time of 4.22 seconds in the 40-yard dash is the second-fastest in NFL Combine history, behind only Xavier Worthy's time of 4.21 seconds.\nEarly years.\nAs a child, Ross played in Snoop Dogg's All-Star league. Ross attended Jordan High School in Long Beach, California. He played wide receiver and cornerback in football and ran track. As a senior, Ross finished third in the 100 metres at the 2013 CIF Southern Section Division 1 final, with a time of 10.66 seconds. He also recorded a time of 21.56 seconds in the 200m.\nRegarded as a four-star recruit by ESPN, Ross was ranked as the No. 49 overall prospect in the state of California. He committed to the University of Washington to play college football.\nCollege career.\nRoss played in all 13 games as a true freshman at Washington in 2013. He finished the year with 16 receptions for 208 yards and one touchdown as a receiver and had 720 kick return yards and a touchdown. In 2014, he played in 13 of 14 games, with seven starts as a receiver and four as a cornerback. That season, he had 17 receptions for 371 yards and four touchdowns as a receiver, 12 tackles and an interception as a cornerback, and had 938 return yards and two touchdowns. Ross missed the 2015 season after suffering a torn ACL during spring practices. Ross returned from the injury in 2016 and had five receptions for 90 yards with two receiving touchdowns and a kick return touchdown in his first game back against Rutgers. On January 3, 2017, Ross announced his decision to forego his senior season and enter the NFL Draft. On February 10, 2017, it was revealed that Ross was diagnosed with a torn labrum in his shoulder. He injured his shoulder earlier during the 2016 season, and re-aggravated it on December 31 in a loss against Alabama in the 2016 Peach Bowl in the College Football Playoff. The injury required surgery, but Ross decided to put it on hold until after the NFL Scouting Combine and pro day workouts.\nProfessional career.\nPre-draft.\nComing out of college, Ross was predicted to be selected in the first round by draft experts and analysts. He was considered one of the top wide receivers and was ranked the second best by NFL analyst Bucky Brooks before the combine. As a top wide receiver prospect, he received an invitation to the NFL Combine and broke Chris Johnson's 4.24 record time in the 40-yard dash. Ross finished with a 4.22, but strained his calves while pulling up at the end of his run. The calf injuries hindered his ability to complete all the set combine drills or run his second attempt at the 40-yard dash. Ross attended Washington's Pro Day, but only ran positional drills. The next day, he had surgery to repair a torn labrum in his shoulder. He was ranked as the third best wide receiver prospect in the draft by ESPN and was ranked the second best wide receiver prospect by \"Sports Illustrated\" and NFLDraftScout.com.\nCincinnati Bengals.\n2017 season.\nThe Cincinnati Bengals selected Ross in the first round (9th overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. He was the third wide receiver to be selected after Corey Davis and Mike Williams. On May 7, 2017, the Bengals signed Ross to a four-year, $17.1 million contract with a signing bonus of $10.6 million.\nRoss competed with Brandon LaFell, Cody Core, Tyler Boyd and Josh Malone throughout training camp to be the starting wide receiver alongside A. J. Green. Although he was a first round pick, head coach Marvin Lewis named him the sixth wide receiver on the depth chart to begin the regular season.\nOn September 14, 2017, Ross made his professional regular season debut on \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Houston Texans after missing the season-opener due to a knee injury. He fumbled his first and only carry of the game, and was subsequently benched after gaining only 12 rushing yards as the Bengals lost, 13–9. That carry proved to be his only touch of his rookie season, as he was only active for two out of the next 10 games and did not record any statistics. A knee injury caused him to miss Weeks 3–5 while the rest were healthy scratches. He was placed on injured reserve on December 4, 2017, with a shoulder injury, ending his rookie season. His debut season was variously described as \"wasted\", \"disappointing\" and \"disastrous\", with Lewis coming under some criticism for his management of Ross.\n2018 season.\nIn the 2018 season opener against the Indianapolis Colts, Ross recorded his first professional touchdown on a three-yard reception in the 34–23 victory. In the 2018 season, Ross had 21 receptions for 210 receiving yards and seven receiving touchdowns.\n2019 season.\nDuring Week 1 against the Seattle Seahawks, Ross posted a breakout performance with seven catches for 158 receiving yards and two touchdowns, but the Bengals lost a close game, 21–20. During Week 2 against the San Francisco 49ers, Ross finished with four catches for 112 receiving yards and a touchdown as the Bengals lost, 41–17. In only the first two games of the 2019 season, Ross compiled more receiving yards than his initial two NFL seasons combined. On October 2, 2019, the Bengals placed Ross on injured reserve as a result of his shoulder injury. He was designated for return from injured reserve on November 13, 2019, and began practicing with the team again. On December 3, 2019, Ross was activated from injured reserve. Overall, Ross finished the 2019 season with 28 receptions for 506 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.\n2020 season.\nOn May 2, 2020, the Bengals declined the fifth-year option on Ross' contract, making him a free agent in 2021. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on August 12, after he left training camp to tend to his son who tested positive for the virus. He was activated from the list on August 23. On October 30, 2020, Ross tweeted that \"It's not a secret that I have requested a trade.\" Despite Ross' statement, he was not traded by the NFL trade deadline. He had been placed on the Bengals' inactive list four of the Bengals previous five games as a \"healthy scratch\" before he was placed on injured reserve on November 14, 2020, after suffering a foot injury in practice. He finished the season playing in three games recording only two receptions for 17 yards and zero touchdowns.\nNew York Giants.\nOn March 19, 2021, Ross signed a one-year $2.5 million contract with the New York Giants. He was placed on injured reserve on September 1, 2021, to start the season. He was activated on October 2. In a week 4 game against the New Orleans Saints, Ross saw his first playing time of the season due to injuries to wide receivers Sterling Shepard and Darius Slayton. Ross recorded three catches for 77 yards and a touchdown in the 27–21 win. He appeared in ten games in the 2021 season. He finished with 11 receptions for 224 receiving yards and one receiving touchdown.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nOn January 9, 2023, Ross signed a reserve/future contract with the Kansas City Chiefs. On July 26, 2023, Ross informed the Chiefs he was retiring. They subsequently placed him on the reserve/retired list."

It is the first to feature the new championship-style system in which overall event winners are determined only by the results of the final meet.\nChanges.\nThe Diamond League's format was completely overhauled for the 2017 edition. The Diamond Race system used in previous years, in which athletes accumulated points through the season with double points in the finals, was replaced with a championship-style format in which earlier meets act as qualifying meets for the finals; the top eight or twelve athletes, depending on the event, will qualify. The two final meetings are held at the end of the season in Zürich (Weltklasse) and Brussels (Memorial Van Damme), with half of the 32 events contested in each final; the overall Diamond League championship in each event will be determined solely by the results of the finals. While not previously used in the Diamond League, this new system is similar to the old IAAF Grand Prix circuit with its IAAF Grand Prix Final.\nScoring in the non-final meets was extended from the top six to the top eight, with the winner receiving eight points and the runner-up seven, down to one point for an eighth-place finish. Instead of all 32 events appearing in six meets and the final, half of the events now appear in only four qualifying meets in addition to the final; the remaining events are still contested in six qualifying meets and the final. A controversial field event rule change from 2016, under which only the top four athletes after three rounds were allowed the full six attempts, was reverted for 2017.\nPoints system.\nA new points system was adopted for the 2017 Diamond League, with the winner of an event at a qualifying meet receiving eight points and the runner-up seven, down to one point for the athlete in eighth place; at the end of the year, the eight or twelve athletes with the most points, depending on the event, will qualify for the finals. In case of a tie on points, the best legal mark during the qualifying phase will determine the athlete who qualifies.\nSchedule.\nThe following fourteen meetings are scheduled to be included in the 2017 season:"

Norway, together with Germany, also matched the record of most gold medals at a single Winter Olympics with 14 gold, originally set by Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\nCross-country skier Marit Bjørgen was the most successful athlete of the games, with five medals, while her male colleagues Johannes Høsflot Klæbo, Simen Hegstad Krüger and Martin Johnsrud Sundby won three each. Biathletes Johannes Thingnes Bø and Emil Hegle Svendsen and ski jumper Robert Johansson also won three medals each.

        "text": "The men's coxed four competition at the 1952 Summer Olympics took place at Mei Bay, Helsinki, Finland. It was held from 20 to 23 August and was won by the team from Czechoslovakia. There were 17 boats (85 competitors) from 17 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The gold medal was Czechoslovakia's first medal in the men's coxed four. Switzerland earned its third consecutive silver medal, and sixth medal in seven Games dating back to 1920 (the only Games in that time where the Swiss team did not win a medal was 1932, when no Swiss boat competed). The reigning champion United States took bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the ninth appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nThe Italian team was regarded as the slight favourite for the event; they had won gold at the European Rowing Championships in 1949, silver in 1950, and gold again in 1951, with the team having changed between competitions. Of the New Zealand team that had won the 1950 British Empire Games, three rowers were in the 1952 Olympic event: Ted Johnson, John O'Brien, and Colin Johnstone. The Danish team was made up of the 1950 European Rowing Championships winners: Niels Kristensen, Ove Nielsen, Peter Hansen, Bent Blach Petersen, and Eivin Kristensen. The New Zealand and Italian team met in the repechage and New Zealand was eliminated. The Czechoslovakian team dominated the competition and won every round. In the final, they defeated the Swizz quad, while the team from the USA—the winners of the 1948 Olympic competition—won bronze.\nEgypt and the Soviet Union each made their debut in the event. France and the United States both made their seventh appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nBased on a previous decision, each boat raced a minimum of two races before it could be eliminated.\nThe competition featured five rounds (three main rounds and two repechages).\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nFour heats were rowed on 20 July. Three of the heats had four teams and one had five teams, with the first two teams to qualify for the semifinals, and the remaining teams progressing to the round one repechage.\nFirst repechage.\nThree heats were rowed in the round one repechage on 21 July, with the first team to qualify for the semi-final repechage.\nSemifinals.\nTwo heats were rowed in the semifinals on 21 July, with the first team to qualify for the final, and all other teams to progress to the semifinal repechage.\nSecond repechage.\nThree heats were rowed in the semifinals repechage on 22 July, with the winning teams progressing to the final.\nFinal.\nFive teams reached the final, which was decided in one race held on 23 July. While conditions had been favourable on the first three days of racing, the day the finals were held saw wind at considerable force. This wind died down later, but the coxed four was the first race of the day and the results were affected by the strong wind."

It was the 48th edition of the tournament (43rd in doubles). The tournament was run by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and was part of the 2017 ATP World Tour. The event took on indoor hard courts. It served as the season-ending championships for players on the ATP Tour.\nThe eight players who qualified for the event were split into two groups of four. During this stage, players competed in a round-robin format (meaning players played against all the other players in their group).\nThe two players with the best results in each group progressed to the semifinals, where the winners of a group faced the runners-up of the other group. This stage, however, was a knock-out stage. The doubles competition used the same format.\nFormat.\nThe ATP Finals had a round-robin format, with eight players/teams divided into two groups of four. The eight seeds were determined by the ATP rankings and ATP Doubles Team Rankings on the Monday after the last ATP World Tour tournament of the calendar year. All singles matches were the best of three tie-break sets, including the final. All doubles matches were two sets (no ad) and a Match Tie-break.\nQualification.\nSingles.\nEight players compete at the tournament, with two named alternates. Players receive places in the following order of precedence:\nIn the event of this totaling more than 8 players, those lower down in the selection order become the alternates. If further alternates are needed, these players are selected by the ATP.\nProvisional rankings are published weekly as the \"Emirates ATP Race to London\", coinciding with the 52-week rolling ATP rankings on the date of selection. Points are accumulated in Grand Slam, ATP World Tour, ATP Challenger Tour and ITF Futures tournaments from the 52 weeks prior to the selection date, with points from the previous years Tour Finals excluded. Players accrue points across 18 tournaments, usually made up of:\nAll players must include the ranking points for mandatory Masters tournaments for which they are on the original acceptance list and for all Grand Slams for which they would be eligible, even if they do not compete (in which case they receive zero points). Furthermore, players who finished 2016 in the world's top 30 are \"commitment players\" who must (if not injured) include points for the 8 mandatory Masters tournament regardless of whether they enter, and who must compete in at least 4 ATP 500 tournaments (though the Monte Carlo Masters may count to this total), of which one must take place after the US Open. Zero point scores may also be taken from withdrawals by non-injured players from ATP 500 tournaments according to certain other conditions outlined by the ATP. Beyond these rules, however, a player may substitute his next best tournament result for missed Masters and Grand Slam tournaments.\nPlayers may have their ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment reduced by one tournament, by reaching each of the following milestones:\nIf a player satisfies all three of these conditions, their mandatory ATP World Tour Masters 1000 commitment is dropped entirely. Players must be in good standing as defined by the ATP as to avail of the reduced commitment.\nDoubles.\nEight teams compete at the tournament, with one named alternates. The eight competing teams receive places according to the same order of precedence as in Singles. The named alternate will be offered first to any unaccepted teams in the selection order, then to the highest ranked unaccepted team, and then to a team selected by the ATP. Points are accumulated in the same competitions as for the Singles tournament. However, for Doubles teams there are no commitment tournaments, so teams are ranked according to their 18 highest points scoring results from any tournaments.\nQualified players.\nSingles.\nOn June 13, following claiming his tenth French Open, Rafael Nadal became the first qualifier.\nRafael Nadal opened his season by playing at the Brisbane International for the first time, where he reached the quarterfinals before losing to Milos Raonic in three sets. Nadal then entered the Australian Open he reached the final and set up a clash against Roger Federer, his first Grand Slam final since he won the 2014 French Open. Nadal went on to lose to Federer in five sets; this was the first time that Nadal had lost to Federer in a Grand Slam since the final of the 2007 Wimbledon Championships. Nadal made it to the final of the Abierto Mexicano Telcel without dropping a set, but was defeated by big-serving Sam Querrey.

        "text": "The 2017 Daytona 500, the 59th running of the event, was held on February 26, 2017, and was won by Kurt Busch of Stewart-Haas Racing after Chase Elliott and Kyle Larson ran out of fuel over the final laps of the race. This was Busch's first Daytona 500 win, and his first career win on a restrictor plate track. Ryan Blaney finished second, and A. J. Allmendinger finished third. This race was contested for 200 laps on the asphalt superspeedway. It was the first race of the 2017 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season, and also marked the first race for Monster Energy as the new title sponsor for NASCAR's top series, replacing Sprint. Jeffrey Earnhardt made NASCAR history when he became the first ever fourth generation driver to compete in the Daytona 500.\nThis was the final Daytona 500 start for Dale Earnhardt Jr., Matt Kenseth, Elliott Sadler, Cole Whitt, and Michael Waltrip.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of six superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the others being Michigan International Speedway, Auto Club Speedway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Pocono Raceway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nRace format and rule changes.\nAll three of NASCAR's main national series adopted a new race format and points system for the 2017 season. Under the new format, each race was divided into three stages. A competition caution is held at the end of the first and second stage, and bonus championship points are awarded to the top 10 drivers. For the 500, the first and second stages each comprised 60 laps of the scheduled distance, with the remainder comprising the third. The leader at the end of each stage, including the overall winner, also receives points that are carried over into their total if they qualify for the season-ending playoffs (renamed from the \"Chase for the Championship\").\nThe race also introduced stricter rules in regard to vehicle repair after on-track accidents; teams are only allowed to repair their cars on pit road in five-minute windows with six crew members, starting once the car crosses the pit road commitment line, and ending when it reaches minimum speed after exiting pit road. Repairs are restricted to repairing sheet metal and re-attaching or reinforcing body panels; body panels may not be replaced. If the vehicle cannot be repaired on pit road and must be taken to the garage, more than six crew members work on the vehicle, or the five-minute clock expires, the vehicle will be removed from the race and cannot return.\nOther technical changes took place for the 2017 season and Daytona 500, including having one fewer set of tires available for the race, teams being required to start the race with the same tires used in qualifying, restrictor plate size openings reduced from to , and new structural safety features—some of which are specifically mandated at Daytona and Talladega.\nPractice.\nFirst practice (February 18).\nJoey Logano was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 46.604 seconds and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nQualifying for the Daytona 500 is different from any other race weekend because the starting lineup for the race, except for the two drivers that post the two fastest timed laps in the final round of qualifying, isn't set on qualifying day. It sets the lineup for the two Duel races the following Thursday.\nUnlike qualifying at non-restrictor plate races, qualifying at Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway consists of two rounds of cars being sent out one at a time to make a single timed lap. The fastest 12 advance to the final round to run for the pole position.\nChase Elliott scored the pole for the Daytona 500 with a time of 46.663 and a speed of . He said afterwards that everyone at Hendrick Motorsports did \"a lot of work this off-season. This team definitely has a knack for these plate tracks, as they showed with Jeff Gordon and then last year with here and Talladega.\" He also mentioned how these accomplishments don't \"just happen by staying the same, as everybody knows. Everyone is always trying to get better and make their cars better and faster, and the engine shop is always finding new things. So I think that's just proof that they're improving with everybody else and taking that next step, which is really impressive.\" He ended by saying he was \"happy to be a part of it, and hopefully we can run good next Sunday.\"\nPractice (post–qualifying).\nBoth practice sessions scheduled for Thursday following qualifying was cancelled due to rain.\nCan-Am Duels.\nThe Can-Am Duels are a pair of NASCAR Sprint Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38, while positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels. \nDuel 1.\nChase Elliott held off late charges in the closing laps to win the first Can-Am Duel race.\nRestarting with eight laps to go, the Fords of Kevin Harvick and Brad Keselowski formed a line on the top side to make a charge at him. The line started stalling out with five to go and was no match for Elliott, only challenged by Harvick and Jamie McMurray.\nHe said in victory lane that he certainly thought he had a chance of winning on Sunday and that if he \"didn't feel that way...I'd stay home. I feel like we have a shot on Sunday. I feel like we had a shot before we got down here. Tonight's result hasn't changed my opinion on that. I'm looking forward to it, obviously. You love to get that qualifying spot on Sunday, but we really earned it tonight, to start on the front row, which is even better. It was definitely a great way to start the season.\"\nThe eight-lap run to the finish was set up by a two-car wreck with 12 laps to go. Coming through the tri-oval heading towards Turn 1, Corey LaJoie rear-ended Reed Sorenson, who checked up, turning Sorenson down into Paul Menard, sending Sorenson down the track and into the inside retaining wall. Sorenson, who missed the race as a result of this wreck, said he guessed LaJoie \"felt like he did what he had to do to make the race. I hope he's proud of that part of it. There's a lot of pressure going in to making this race. It's a very big deal for a small team like ours.\"\nDuel 2.\nDale Earnhardt Jr. dominated the second Duel race leading 53 of 60 laps. That total, however, didn't include the final lap as he lost the lead for the victory on the final lap to Denny Hamlin.\nHamlin received a push from Austin Dillon and faked Earnhardt out on the backstretch to pass him going into Turn 3 to win the second Duel race. He credited Dillon for the \"great push there...We worked really well together that entire race. I'll keep that in mind in the 500...I can't thank this team enough for a great job by Wheels (Mike Wheeler, crew chief). FedEx announced their renewal today so that's a great sign of a great year hopefully to come.\"\nWith 18 laps remaining, Ryan Blaney and Jimmie Johnson made contact on the backstretch. Five laps later, Johnson blows a right-side tire and slams the wall in Turn 3, setting up the final nine laps.\nPractice (post–Duels).\nSecond practice.\nDavid Ragan was the fastest in the second practice session with a time of 46.178 seconds and a speed of .\nThird practice.\nKyle Busch was the fastest in the third practice session with a time of 45.624 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice.\nRicky Stenhouse Jr. was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 45.351 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nStage 1.\nChase Elliott led the field to the green flag at 2:40 p.m. He jumped ahead of teammate Dale Earnhardt Jr. to lead the first lap. Earnhardt was caught in the middle of the inside and outside lines with no draft help, also known as the \"sucker hole,\" and fell back through the pack on the fourth lap. Jamie McMurray used the bottom line to take the lead on the eighth lap. Joey Logano made an unscheduled stop for a loose wheel on lap 14. A group of cars, all Toyota's, hit pit road on lap 17. Erik Jones overshot his pit box and Daniel Suárez was hit with a pass through penalty for speeding. Matt Kenseth came down pit road a second time for a loose wheel; a result of flat-spotting his tires on his first stop.\nDuring the Toyota pit cycle, Kevin Harvick took the lead from McMurray on lap 18. The lapped car of Logano blocked his advanced and allowed Elliott to power by on the outside line on lap 23. The top line started losing steam, however, and Harvick took back the lead on lap 26. Another group of cars hit pit road on lap 31. Corey LaJoie mistimed his pit entry and aborted right before the entrance of pit road. When he did, he almost slammed into the rear of Clint Bowyer. Then, his car continued up the track, slammed the outside wall in the tri-oval and left debris up against the wall, bringing out the first caution of the race. Kurt Busch restarted the race from the tail end of the field for speeding on pit road.\nThe race restarted on lap 34. Kyle Busch lead the outside line charge past Harvick on the backstretch to take the lead on lap 43. Truex followed likewise the next lap, powering by Busch on the top line going into Turn 1 to take the lead. Busch took it back on lap 45. Ryan Blaney dove under him on the backstretch to take the lead on lap 49. David Ragan hit the wall on the frontstretch the following lap, but the race continued under green. Busch retook the lead on lap 52. Ricky Stenhouse Jr. cut down a tire in Turn 3, but the race remained green. Busch came to the line the leader at the conclusion of stage 1 and the second caution flew on lap 61 for the end of the stage. Harvick exited pit road first. Austin Dillon restarted the race from the tail end of the field for speeding.\nStage 2.\nThe race restarted on lap 68. For most of the second stage, the racing was more calm and collected. The outside line was the strongest line and the inside started dissipating by lap 78. The Toyota cars repeated their stage 1 move of short-pitting the segment on lap 81. Jimmie Johnson took the lead as a number of cars, mostly Ford's, came to pit road on lap 90. Earnhardt took the lead for the first time on lap 97.\nRounding Turn 3 on lap 105, Busch's car suffered either a left or right-rear tire blowout, then spun towards the wall and into Jones, Kenseth and Ty Dillon, causing a 6-car pileup. Race leader Earnhardt was clipped by Busch and slammed the wall. He said he didn't \"know what happened there with the No. 18 (Busch) he just got turned around. I tried to get the wheel turned and get down the race track but I lifted off the gas to miss it, and got on the splitter a little bit and the car went straight. We jumped him, and got in the wall a little bit. Wasn't too hard of a hit. We thought we could get the car fixed, and get back out there and see what we could do with the rest of the day and make up some spots maybe. But, there is just too much damage. The radiator is pushed back. The toe is all messed up. The front suspension is knocked around pretty bad so the upper A-frame is laid over on the motor. We just can't drive it like that.\" He checked out of the infield care center with no health complications. Earnhardt, who missed 18 races last season due to a concussion, credited his new headrest for walking away without another one, saying \"the (older) headrest, when you fly into the wall, it's like getting hit with a baseball bat. That car will take a few (G-forces) and if you have a lot of distance there, you can double the G's. We talked to NASCAR over the winter and they helped me understand how to better withstand those wrecks. We have (the headrest) tight on both sides.\" Busch took his frustration out on Goodyear. \"Nothing that we did wrong,\" Busch said to FOX. \"Obviously Goodyear tires just aren't very good at holding air. It's very frustrating when we have that every single year we've been here. Last year we had it as well too. It wrecked us in practice and tore up a car.\" Kenseth finished the race in 40th, his third career last-place finish. This brought out the third caution and cleanup necessitated a 17-minute red flag period. Elliott Sadler was the leader when the race resumed under caution, but surrendered the lead to Harvick when he hit pit road.\nThe race restarted on lap 113 and Harvick led all the way to the end of stage 2 as the fourth caution flew for the stage conclusion. All but the first eight cars opted to pit under the caution.\nStage 3.\nThe race restarted on lap 125. Kyle Larson took the position for a brief moment, but Elliott powered by on the outside line and retook the lead on lap 126. Kasey Kahne on the inside line edged his teammate at the line to take the lead for the first time on lap 127. On the same lap, McMurray shoved Johnson down the backstretch when Johnson got loose, turned down into Trevor Bayne and pin-balled through the middle of the pack in Turn 3, collecting 14 cars. This brought out the fifth caution. Johnson said afterwards that the whole wreck was avoidable, \"and it wasn't called for. From the minute I got off of Turn 2 on the entire back straightaway, I kept getting hit, and the rear tires are off the ground.\"\nThe race restarted with 67 laps to go. With 65 to go, Blaney signaled on the backstretch that he was coming to pit road this lap, believing he had a tire going down. Exiting Turn 4, he started decelerating to dive onto pit road when Sadler swerved up the track to avoid him. This clipped both Bayne and Stenhouse, sent them down the track and into the inside wall, bringing out the sixth caution. Kahne took the lead prior to the caution\nThe race restarted with 59 to go. Heading down the backstretch, McMurray, in the top line, tried passing to the inside of Elliott, but his advance was blocked. He checked up and got hooked into the outside wall by Brendan Gaughan. Suárez swerved to the left to avoid a t-bone collision with McMurray, only to collide with Ryan Newman. The accordion effect resulted in an 11-car wreck that brought out the seventh caution. \"I haven't seen the replay yet,\" Keselowski said after being caught up in the wreck, \"but everybody wrecked in front of me. We had just pitted and were running really good, right up at the front where we needed to be in contention for a solid finish and hopefully a win. … That is unfortunate.\" Austin Dillon took the lead prior to the caution.\nThe race restarted with 52 to go. Logano took the lead with 51 to go. On the backstretch with 50 to go, Elliott shunted Joey Gase, which sent him into the outside wall and down the track, bringing out the eighth caution. Cole Whitt opted not to pit under the caution and assumed the lead.\nThe race restarted with 47 to go. Whitt lead the first lap after the restart, thanks to a push from Logano on the inside line, but Aric Almirola powered by Whitt on the outside to take the lead with 45 to go. Suddenly, Almirola slowed up and fell back, handing the lead to Larson with 43 to go. After battling side-by-side for a few laps, Logano took the lead with 37 to go. The top-five raced single-file with 31 to go. Kurt Busch led the outside line charge before Elliott took it over with 27 to go. The next lap, he cleared Logano for the race lead on the backstretch. With 20 to go, the bottom line disappeared and the top-12 cars formed a breakaway draft running up against the wall. Blaney broke out of line to lead the inside line's charge with 10 to go, but they made no progress and rejoined the top line with seven to go. With four to go, Elliott ran out of gas and Martin Truex Jr. took the lead in Turn 4. With two to go, the same fate befell Truex. Larson took command of the race with one lap to go. He also ran out of gas; Busch passed him exiting Turn 2 and won the 59th running of the Daytona 500.\nPost-race.\nDriver comments.\n\"There is nothing predictable about this race anymore and the more years that have gone by that I didn't win I kept trying to go back to patterns that I had seen in the past,\" Busch said in victory lane. \"My mirror fell off with 30 laps to go and I couldn't even see out the back. And I thought that was an omen. Throw caution to the wind. The more unpredictability that keeps unfolding at the Daytona 500, I predicted it. It just got crazy and wild and I am so proud of all the drivers at the end. We put on a show for a full fuel run and nobody took each other out and it was one of the smartest chess games I have seen out there. All the hard work that Ford and SHR put into this -- this Ford Fusion is in Daytona's victory lane.\" Team owner Tony Stewart, who failed to win the Daytona 500 in 17 attempts, said if he knew he \"would retire and win the next race, I would have retired 17 years ago and got it that way. It's a pretty cool deal. This is one that we've waited for, for a long, long time.\"\nBlaney, who scored a career-best finish of runner-up despite running out of gas on the final lap, said he \"tried to make a move with 10 to go and I didn't go anywhere. I thought we were kind of stuck. Luckily, we had the 22 with us. I kind of helped him and he kind of helped me. Late there we got a big run into (Turn) 1 and we kind of all separated and I got a big pull. I got to second behind the 41 somehow and that kept us going the whole way. I laid back to the 47 thinking I'd get a good run and I was sputtering and running out of gas on the backstretch.\"\nMichael Waltrip, who finished eighth – and was the highest finishing Toyota driver – in his final career NASCAR start, said this race will \"be a great memory! I felt like so many times, I was in the middle of a crash and I missed it. You do a good job and get lucky. At the end, I just lost the draft, and that's unfortunate because I was able to weave my way past people. I had a really good-handling car.\"\nRace results.\nStage Results.\nStage 1\n\"Laps:\" 60\nStage 2\n\"Laps:\" 60\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage 3\n\"Laps:\" 80\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States. The booth crew consisted of longtime NASCAR lap-by-lap announcer Mike Joy, three–time Daytona 500 champion Jeff Gordon, and 1989 race winner Darrell Waltrip. Pit road was manned by Jamie Little, Chris Neville, Vince Welch and Matt Yocum.\nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Motor Racing Network—who has covered the Daytona 500 since 1970—and simulcast on Sirius XM NASCAR Radio. The booth crew consisted of longtime announcer Joe Moore, Jeff Striegle and 1989 Cup Series champion Rusty Wallace. Longtime turn announcer – and prodigy of MRN co-founder Ken Squier – Dave Moody was the lead turn announcer. He called the Daytona 500 from atop the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 2 when the field was racing through turns 1 and 2. Mike Bagley worked the backstretch for the Daytona 500 from a spotter's stand on the inside of the track. Kyle Rickey called the Daytona 500 when the field was racing through turns 3 and 4 from the Sunoco tower outside the exit of turn 4. On pit road, MRN was manned by lead pit reporter and NASCAR Hall of Fame Executive Director Winston Kelley. He was joined on pit road by Steve Post and Alex Hayden."

        "text": "The 2002 Belmont Stakes was the 134th running of the Belmont Stakes. The race, known as the \"test of the champion\" and sometimes called the \"final jewel\" in thoroughbred horse racing's Triple Crown series, was held on June 8, 2002, three weeks after the Preakness Stakes and five weeks after the Kentucky Derby.\nWar Emblem, trained by Bob Baffert and ridden by Victor Espinoza, was the race favorite after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes in front-running fashion. However, he lost all chance of completing the Triple Crown after stumbling at the start of the race. Lightly regarded Sarava won at odds of 70–1, the biggest long-shot in the history of the Belmont Stakes.\nPre-race.\nWar Emblem established himself as the horse to beat in the Belmont Stakes after wire-to-wire wins in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. Despite his racing ability, he was a temperamental colt known around the stable as \"Hannibal Lecter\" for his habit of trying to bite anyone who came too close. Baffert was optimistic about the colt's chances, saying, \"With [jockey] Victor [Espinoza], there's no thinking involved. Just get him out of the gate and let him go.\"\nWith Puzzlement a late scratch, ten other horses entered the race but only a few were given serious consideration by the bettors. War Emblem had already beaten most of the horses in the field, including Proud Citizen (2nd in the Derby, 3rd in the Preakness), Perfect Drift (3rd in the Derby), Medaglia d'Oro (4th in the Derby and 8th in the Preakness) and Magic Weisner (2nd in the Preakness). Of the \"new shooters\", the most highly regarded was Sunday Break, who had won the Peter Pan Stakes in May.\nTrainer Kenneth McPeek had trained the beaten favorite for the Kentucky Derby, Harlan's Holiday. However, his entry in the Belmont was the lightly regarded Sarava, whose only win was the Sir Barton Stakes in May. \"He's a nice horse,\" said McPeek. \"He's a horse that's kind of coming together late. He's been a bit of a surprise for everybody, but at the same time, he's very well bred.\"\nA then record crowd of 103,222 attended the race.\nRace description.\nWar Emblem stumbled badly at the start and lost several lengths to the rest of the field. Baffert knew immediately that his chance to win the Triple Crown was over. \"If I was on the walkie-talkie, I would have told Victor to pull him up. I didn't want him to go a mile and a half like that.\"\nEspinoza tried to salvage the situation by moving War Emblem to the rail behind the early leaders, Wiseman's Ferry and Medaglia d'Oro. War Emblem disliked being behind horses though and fought with Espinoza's attempts to settle him. He moved to the lead with about half a mile left in the race, but then ran out of energy, eventually finishing eighth. Medaglia d'Oro recovered the lead but was run down by Sarava in the stretch, who won by half a length. The two were well clear of Sunday Break in third.\n\"Of course we were shocked,\" said Gary Drake, Sarava's part-owner. \"You don't lead a horse over there at 70-1 and not be surprised when he wins.\" McPeek added, \"We just didn't know how good he was. You never do until you throw him in the ring with this kind.\"\nChart.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: — 0:24.11; — 0:48.09; — 1:12.38; mile — 1:37.01; — 2:03.50; final — 2:29.71.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:24.11) (:23.98) (:24.29) (:24.63) (:26.49) (:26.21)\nPayout.\nThe 135th Belmont Payout Schedule"

The NL and AL were formed in 1876 and 1901, respectively. Beginning in 1903, the two leagues cooperated but remained legally separate entities until 2000 when they merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner of Baseball. This list documents all 30 active MLB teams ranked by win–loss percentage as of the completion of the . These records do not include results from a team's playing time in the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players or while members of any minor league.\nThe New York Yankees has the highest regular season winning percentage, with . The Miami Marlins have the lowest, with . The San Francisco Giants have the most overall wins (11,475), while the Arizona Diamondbacks have the fewest (2,012). The Philadelphia Phillies have the most losses, with 11,270, while the Tampa Bay Rays have the fewest, with 2,114. With 22,123 games played, the Chicago Cubs have played more games than any other MLB club. Conversely, Tampa Bay has played the fewest (4,139). San Francisco has recorded the most ties in MLB history, with 163. Tie games do not count toward MLB standings, and they have become scarce since the advent of a 2007 rule change assuring that a tie game can occur only if it is the last scheduled matchup between the two teams that season and has no bearing on the postseason.\nAs of the completion of the 2023 World Series, the Miami Marlins have the highest postseason winning percentage, with , while the Minnesota Twins have the lowest, with . The New York Yankees have the most postseason wins (244), while the Colorado Rockies have the fewest (10). The Yankees also have the most postseason losses (178), while Colorado has the fewest (14)."

It is a popular activity in town and there is an annual tournament, held during Semana Santa every year, with fights held on Good Friday. The tournaments began as a punishment to criminals who'd then have to fight it out amongst themselves; since 1900, it developed into an open contest in which anyone can participate, and winners receive trophies.\nRules.\nChivarreto boxing rules differ from traditional, amateur or professional boxing rules in that, at Chivarreto, no boxing gloves are used, fighters instead fight bare-knuckled.\nTypically, there are four referees present to enforce rules and protect fighters from unnecessary harm, instead of one as in other types of boxing. Bouts are held inside a ring, which is placed near Chivarreto's plaza in order so that all of Chivarreto's residents and also tourists from other areas can be spectators.\nUnlike other types of boxing, knockouts are declared immediately after one contestant hits the floor due to a punch being connected on him or her. Knockouts are also declared if one of the contestants quits. If a knockout does not happen after a while, it is up to the contestants to decide when to finish their bout, after which the four referees decide upon a winner."

In June 2016, the executive board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that they would support the proposal to include all of the shortlisted sports in the 2020 Games. Finally, on August 3, 2016, all five sports (counting baseball and softball together as one sport) were approved for inclusion in the 2020 Olympic program.\nOne of the biggest obstacles for surfing to be included in the Olympics for many years was in the event of a landlocked country hosting the games which would make surfing difficult to take place, and another one was that drowning is one of the big risks in surfing, and the IOC was less likely to take high liabilities in the event of a death.\nMedal table.\nSources:"

        "text": "The Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team was one of the top amateur baseball teams in Canada in the 1950s and 1960s. For 16 years, the team dominated the senior baseball circuit in Ontario.\nBackground.\nBaseball has a long history in Milton, particularly in Campbellville, Ontario where it had its beginnings with the Lumberman's Baseball Club as early as 1872. It really flourished as a community tradition in the 1920s and 1930s, but was interrupted with the outbreak of World War II.\nIn 1950, a team of local boys formed a juvenile team that competed in the Halton County League in the 1950 and 1951 seasons. As several boys were about to go over juvenile age for the 1952 season, and on account of half a dozen local players already playing in the Intermediate League for Milton or Waterdown, it was decided to enter Campbellville into this top competition.\nIn the 1950s and 60s, the Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team won numerous county and provincial titles in a 16-year span from 1952 to 1968. A grandstand and club house was erected in 1960 in Campbellville to make room for the 2,000 spectators that would descend on the hamlet. In 1953, the Campbellville Baseball Club won the OBA Intermediate C Championship in just its second year in the league, before repeating again and again.\nManaged by Len Andrews, and known as the Merchants, the men's Campbellville baseball team won 11 consecutive Halton county league titles, as well as 12 Ontario Championship titles between 1952-1967, an amazing feat for a hamlet of 300 at the time.\nNotable records.\nDuring this 16-year era, the team had a winning percentage of .771 and picked up championship titles all over Ontario.\nDuring the same period in the Ontario Baseball Association playoffs, the team won 85 of 108 games (.787 winning percentage).\nWithin the years of 1959-64, the team's peak, Campbellville went 175-36-5 (.829 winning percentage).\nJim Vipond, sports editor of the national newspaper the Globe and Mail, wrote in one of his columns: \"Hats off to Campbellville's championship baseball teams.\"\nWhen the club repeated as Ontario Intermediate C champions in 1954, it marked the first time this had been accomplished since the creation of the \"C\" classification in 1934.\nManager.\nLen Andrews served as a lieutenant in the Canadian Army overseas during the Second World War with the 22nd Canadian Regiment (Canadian Grenadier Guards).\nHe received several awards for his amateur baseball work including from the Premier of Ontario and the Ontario Baseball Association of which he was past president and a life member.\nLegacy.\nAs a result of the strong baseball traditions established by the intermediate team, other Campbellville baseball teams won four more provincial titles between 1968 and 1984.\nThe Old Campbellville Baseball Park remains one of Canada's oldest baseball parks. It was significantly reworked prior to the 1953 season.\nThe team is considered one of the greatest amateur sports teams in the history of Ontario.\nHonours.\nIn 2008, numerous efforts were undertaken to have the team recognized by the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame, including by NHL referee Bruce Hood. To date, those efforts have been unsuccessful.\nHowever, the intermediate men's squad (1952-67 era) was inducted into the Baseball Ontario Hall of Fame in 2014.\nIn 2016, the Milton Sports Hall of Fame inducted the Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team inducted as its first ever honoured team."

        "text": "Combat archery, sometimes known as battle archery, is a sport similar to dodgeball, paintball or Nerf war played with bows and arrows tipped with foam.\nHistory.\nThe Archery Tag equipment brand was invented by John Jackson of Waterloo, Indiana in 2011. The sport experienced a boost in popularity from the \"Hunger Games\" book and film series, which features a bow-wielding protagonist, and Jackson staged target shooting activities using his patented \"non-lethal arrows\" at local premieres of the films. By 2014, Jackson had licensed the game to 170 locations, in the United States, UK, The Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, and a number of other countries. Other brands such as Battle Archery, Battle Bows, or Arrow Tag have followed suit with similar formats.\nRules &amp; gameplay.\nThe combat archery sport game play is a combination of 3 other main sports including, dodgeball, paintball, and archery. Participants form teams of 5 and shoot at opponents with large foam tip arrows using a bow. To avoid injury, participants wear protective face masks and use bows with less than 30lb draw weight.\nThe game's rules closely resemble dodgeball. The game begins with a number of arrows in the center of the arena. At the whistle, players race to collect them, before firing them at one another across the playing field. A player is eliminated if struck by an arrow, and a player can bring an eliminated teammate back into play by catching an arrow."

It was the third club to be established at White Rock Lake. Dallas Sailing Club (DSC) had been chartered in 1928, and in 1935 eleven Snipe sailors left DSC and formed the \"West Shore Sailing Club\", changing the name to \"White Rock Sailing Club\" (WRSC) that same year. Snipe Fleet 1 moved from DSC to WRSC.

        "text": "Thomas Michael Curry (born 15 June 1998) is an English professional rugby union player who plays as a flanker for Premiership Rugby club Sale Sharks and the England national team.\nClub career.\nCurry played for Crewe &amp; Nantwich in the early stages of his amateur career where he was coached by his father.\nCurry made his professional debut against Scarlets on 15 October 2016 in the European Champions Cup, becoming the fourth-youngest English player and youngest Sale Sharks player to have played in the competition. He scored on his Premiership Rugby debut on 30 October 2016, becoming the third-youngest scorer in the competition. At the end of the 2016-17 season, he was named a joint recipient of Sale Sharks' Young Player of the Season award, sharing the award with his brother Ben. He captained Sale in their semi-final defeat to Exeter Chiefs in the 2020-21 season, his first playoff appearance for the club.\nIn the 2021-22 season Curry made 11 appearances for Sale. He started Sale's Champion's Cup quarter final loss to Racing 92.\nIn the 2022-23 season Curry scored a try in Sale's second round win over Bath Rugby. He then scored against defending champions Leicester Tigers at Welford Road in round five. Curry scored his first try in the Champions Cup in a 39-0 win against Ulster on 11 December 2022.\nIn November 2023 Curry underwent a hip operation which ruled him out of the entire 2023-24 Premiership Rugby season, along with the 2024 Six Nations. \nInternational career.\nCurry was named in the England U20 squad for the 2016/17 season on 14 October 2016, having previously represented England U18. Curry was part of the England U20 squad that won a Grand Slam in the 2017 Six Nations Under 20 Championship\nEngland.\nCurry was called up to the senior England squad by Eddie Jones for their 2017 summer tour of Argentina. In his first England appearance against the Barbarians on 28 May 2017 he was named Man of the Match. The match against the Barbarians was a 'non-test' fixture, so he did not receive an official cap. Curry made his first capped appearance for England at flanker in the first test against Argentina in June 2017. He became the youngest player to start at flanker for England, and the youngest England forward since 1912.\nCurry was named in England's 2019 Six Nations Squad and started at No 7 in all of England's games. He scored tries in the matches against Wales and Scotland. He started at 6 for the 2019 Rugby World Cup final. With England, Curry has won the Six Nations Championship and the Autumn Nations cup, both in 2020.\nCurry was part of the squad for the November 2021 Autumn Nations Series. He was named as a vice captain for the test series, along with fellow squad members Courtney Lawes and Ellis Genge. Curry started the first match of the series, against Tonga, at Number 8. He went on to start both of England's victories over Australia and South Africa.\nOn 18 January 2022 Curry was named as part of Jones' 36 man squad for the 2022 Six Nations Championship. Curry was named to captain the side from openside flanker in the opening match at Murrayfield, becoming England's youngest captain since 1988. England lost the match 17-20. He also started in England's subsequent victories over Italy and Wales. He suffered a concussion against Wales and exited the game at half time but passed the return to play protocols and was declared fit to start against Ireland. Curry lasted only 14 minutes against Ireland before suffering a hamstring injury which also ruled him out for the final game of the tournament against France. England lost to Ireland and France, finishing the 2022 Six Nations in 3rd place with only two victories.\nOn 6 June 2022 Curry was named as part of the training squad for England's fixture against the Barbarians and subsequent tour to Australia. Curry was named as captain for the game against the Barbarians at Twickenham. England were beaten by the Barbarians 52-21, with the Barbarians spending the majority of the match with 14 men. He was named in England's squad for the 2022 England rugby union tour of Australia on 20 June. Curry started the first test match of the tour at openside flanker but suffered a concussion during the match and was replaced at half time. As a result of this he was ruled out of the rest of the test match series, which England would go on to win 2-1.\nOn 26 September 2022 Curry was named as part of an England squad for a three-day training camp prior to England's end-of-year international fixtures. He started all four of England's test matches at openside flanker, receiving a yellow card in England's final match against South Africa.\nCurry suffered a hamstring tear while on club duty with Sale which ruled him out of the first two games of the 2023 Six Nations.\nOn 7 August 2023, Curry was named as part of the England squad for the 2023 Rugby World Cup. In the opening Pool D match against Argentina, Curry became the first England player to be shown a red card in a Rugby World Cup. In the third minute of play he was shown a yellow card after making head-on-head contact with Juan Cruz Mallía, and this was subsequently upgraded to red under the ‘bunker’ review system. He was subsequently forced to miss England's next two matches in the World Cup, against Japan and Chile.\nBritish and Irish Lions.\nCurry was picked in the 37-man squad for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to South Africa in the summer of 2021. He made his debut for the Lions in the first of two tour matches against the Cell C Sharks. Three days later Curry appeared off the bench in the second match against the Sharks, scoring his only try of the tour. His last appearance before the test series was in the Lions' first loss of the tour against South Africa 'A'. Curry started all three tests against South Africa at openside flanker, with South Africa going on to win the test series 2-1\nPersonal life.\nCurry is the twin brother of Sale Sharks flanker Ben Curry, son of Bishop Heber High School head teacher David Curry and nephew of former England hooker John Olver and cousin of former Northampton Saints and current Doncaster Knights fly-half Sam Olver. \nJohn Olver also taught at Oundle School, where Curry was educated for sixth form (age 16-18)."

The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that the Fencing Association’s practice was discriminatory, and ordered it to either allow Freilich to compete on a different day or hand him technical victories for any Sabbath match. Freilich subsequently won the age group World Cadet Championships in Moscow, and the age group European Championships. But the ruling expired after two years, and did not result in any permanent change. The Israeli Supreme Court declined to intervene a second time.\nEilat, Israel, was chosen to host of the European Fencing Confederation Under-23 Championships in 2018."

        "text": "Rafael Darwing Bautista Rodriguez (born March 8, 1993) is a Dominican former professional baseball outfielder. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Washington Nationals.\nProfessional career.\nWashington Nationals.\nBautista signed with the Washington Nationals as an international free agent in January 2012. He began his professional career in 2012 with the rookie-league-level Dominican Summer League Nationals in the Dominican Summer League, where he batted .329 with 25 runs batted in (RBIS) and 47 stolen bases. In 2013 he played in the rookie-league-level Gulf Coast League for the Gulf Coast League Nationals, who that year finished their regular season with a record of 49–9, giving them the highest winning percentage (.845) for a full regular season ever achieved by a minor-league baseball team based in the United States. The team then won all three of its playoff games, defeating the Gulf Coast League Pirates in a single-game semifinal playoff and sweeping the Gulf Coast League Red Sox in the best-of-three league championship series, to become the 2013 Gulf Coast League champions. Bautista appeared in 52 games during the championship season, batting .322 with one home run, 27 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases.\nBautista spent 2014 with the Class A Hagerstown Suns in the South Atlantic League, hitting .290 with five home runs, 54 RBIs, and 69 stolen bases. He split 2015 between the Class A Advanced Potomac Nationals in the Carolina League, the Class A Short Season Auburn Doubledays in the New York-Penn League, and the Gulf Coast League Nationals, batting a combined .275 for the year with a home run, 14 RBIs, and 26 stolen bases, and over the 2015-2016 offseason played in the Dominican Winter League with Leones del Escogido. He advanced to the Class AA Harrisburg Senators in the Eastern League for the 2016 season, hitting .282 with four home runs, 39 RBIs, and 56 stolen bases, and after that season the Washington Nationals added him to their 40-man roster. He again played winter ball with Leones del Escogido during the 2016-2017 offseason.\nBautista began the 2017 season with the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs in the International League. The Washington Nationals promoted him to the major leagues on April 29, 2017. He made his major league debut on April 30 in a 23–5 Nationals victory over the New York Mets at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., batting twice and going 0-for-2 against Mets catcher Kevin Plawecki, who was making his first-ever major league appearance as a pitcher. On May 6, in a 6–2 Nationals victory over the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, he made his first career major-league start, playing right field, and got his first career major-league hit, a single through the infield off Phillies pitcher Vince Velasquez. The Nationals optioned Bautista back to Syracuse on May 8.\nThe Nationals recalled Bautista on August 27, but optioned him back to Syracuse the next day. They called him back up again on September 7, and he finished the regular season with the Nationals. He completed the season having played in 17 major-league games, batting .160 with four hits – all singles – in 25 at-bats, scoring two runs, and with a slugging percentage of .160 and an on-base percentage of .222.\nIn the minor leagues, Bautista played 43 games for Syracuse and 13 for the Gulf Coast League Nationals during 2017. He hit a combined .259 for the two teams, with 14 RBIs and nine stolen bases.\nBautista participated in 2018 major-league spring training before the Nationals optioned him to the Class AAA Syracuse Chiefs on March 14. He was reassigned to the Class AA Harrisburg Senators on April 2 and began the season with them, but was promoted back to Syracuse on April 12. He had made 45 plate appearances for Syracuse, batting .429 with a .966 on-base-plus-slugging percentage (OPS) when, on April 24, the Nationals called him up to the major leagues. He appeared in nine games, usually as a late-game replacement or a pinch-runner, made one start, and went 0-for-6, striking out once and scoring a run before the Nationals optioned him back to Syracuse on May 7 to make room on their 25-man roster when they activated right-handed relief pitcher Shawn Kelley from the 10-day disabled list. Bautista made another 46 plate appearances for Syracuse, batting .300 with a .749 OPS, before colliding with another player during a game against the Rochester Red Wings at Rochester, New York, on May 17, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament, lateral collateral ligament, and meniscus in his left knee. The injury required season-ending surgery. He ended his season with an overall .303 batting average in the minor leagues, with three doubles, a triple, a home run, seven RBIs, and six stolen bases in the minors for the year. On June 9, the Nationals released Bautista to make room for Adam Eaton on their roster when they activated Eaton from the 60-day disabled list. On June 13, Washington re-signed Bautista to a minor league deal. He spent the remainder of the season in Triple-A Syracuse.\nIn 2019, Bautista played for Double-A Harrisburg, Single-A Hagerstown, and Low-A Auburn, slashing .182/.256/.255 with 2 home runs and 9 RBI across 29 games between the three teams. Bautista did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic. On November 2, 2020, he elected free agency. On November 12, 2020, Bautista re-signed with the Nationals on a minor league contract. Bautista was assigned to the Triple-A Rochester Red Wings to begin the 2021 season. He elected free agency on November 7, 2021."

        "title": "Austin Adams (baseball, born 1991)",
        "text": "Austin Lance Adams (born May 5, 1991) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Oakland Athletics of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Washington Nationals, Seattle Mariners, San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks.\nCareer.\nAdams attended Zephyrhills High School in Zephyrhills, Florida, where he played baseball and basketball and played college baseball at the University of South Florida. He pursued a degree in physical education. In 2012, his junior year, he went 1–2 with a 1.95 ERA in 27.2 relief innings pitched.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nThe Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim selected Adams in the eighth round of the 2012 Major League Baseball draft. He began his professional career playing for the Orem Owlz in the Rookie Advanced-level Pioneer League during the 2012 season. He spent 2013 with the Single–A Burlington Bees in the Midwest League and 2014 with the High–A Inland Empire 66ers in the California League. He began the 2015 season with Inland Empire, then was promoted during the season first to the Double–A Arkansas Travelers in the Texas League and then to the Triple–A Salt Lake Bees in the Pacific Coast League. He split the 2016 season between the Rookie-level AZL Angels in the Arizona League and the Double–A Arkansas Travelers.\nThe Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim added Adams to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season. On December 10, 2016, they traded Adams and Kyle McGowin to the Washington Nationals for infielder Danny Espinosa.\nWashington Nationals.\n2017.\nAdams began the 2017 season with the Triple–A Syracuse Chiefs of the International League. With the Nationals' bullpen struggling over the first half of the 2017 season, Adams was mentioned by \"The Washington Post\" in a July 12 article among several minor league pitchers the team could consider calling upon as reinforcements. Two days later, Adams was called up to the big leagues for the first time, along with Syracuse teammate Trevor Gott, after the Nationals optioned struggling left-handed reliever Sammy Solis and assigned ailing starter Joe Ross to the disabled list with an elbow sprain. Adams made his major league debut on July 15, 2017, against the Cincinnati Reds, loading the bases on an error, a walk, and a wild pitch and then walking in a run and allowing a single before he was pulled from the game. Adams was optioned back to Syracuse on July 18, his earned run average still standing at infinity due to the earned run he allowed without recording an out. Adams was recalled by the Nationals on September 1, 2017, and recorded his first major league outs in an inning of relief against the Milwaukee Brewers on September 3, after loading the bases.\n2018.\nAdams began 2018 with Triple-A Syracuse. On April 22, the Nationals called him up to the major leagues. He pitched on April 25 in a 15-2 Washington win over the San Francisco Giants at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, giving up a hit and a walk but no runs in one inning of work. On April 28, Nationals manager Dave Martinez brought him in to relieve left-hander Sammy Solis in the 10th inning of a game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., against the Arizona Diamondbacks with one out, runners on second and third, and the score tied 3–3. Martinez intended Adams to face right-handed utility player Chris Owings, who was waiting in the on-deck circle. However, Martinez made the mistake of making the pitching change before the public address announcer had announced Owings as the batter. With Adams in the game, Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo took advantage of Martinez's error by recalling Owings and sending left-handed outfielder Jarrod Dyson to the plate, forcing Adams to face a left-hander rather than a right-hander as Martinez had intended. Adams walked Dyson to load the bases. With only one reliever – Carlos Torres – remaining in the Washington bullpen, Martinez left Adams in to face the next batter, center fielder A. J. Pollock, as well, and Adams also walked Pollock, forcing in what turned out to be the winning run in a 4–3 Diamondbacks victory. On April 29, the Nationals optioned Adams back to Syracuse. Adams was designated for assignment on April 30, 2019, following the selecting of Dan Jennings’ contract.\nSeattle Mariners.\nOn May 4, 2019, the Nationals traded Adams to the Seattle Mariners for left-handed minor-league pitcher Nick Wells and cash considerations. He was assigned to the Tacoma Rainiers. On May 13, he was called up to the major league roster. He registered an ERA of 3.77 in 29 games.\nSan Diego Padres.\nOn August 30, 2020, the Mariners traded Adams, Austin Nola, and Dan Altavilla to the San Diego Padres for Ty France, Taylor Trammell, Andrés Muñoz, and Luis Torrens.\nAdams had problems with control in his 2021 MLB season. On September 1, 2021, Adams became the first MLB pitcher to ever register 20 or more hit by pitch with less than 50 IPs in a season. Adams is the first pitcher to record a HBP 20 times or more since 2004. During his 8-pitch outing, he hit batters 2 times, walked 1 batter, gave up 1 hit, and registered 0 strikes.\nOn September 12, he became the first pitcher since 1923 to record 23 or more hit by pitches in a season. His final HBP of the season was on September 17, against Yadier Molina of the St. Louis Cardinals in the bottom of the 8th inning. Adams finished the season with 24 HBPs, a new record in the live-ball era.\nOn March 22, 2022, Adams signed a $925,000 contract with the Padres, avoiding salary arbitration. On April 28, Adams was placed on the 60-day injured list after receiving a platelet-rich plasma injection for a strained right forearm. On August 5, Adams underwent season-ending flexor tendon surgery. He appeared in only 2 games for the Padres that year, tossing 2.1 scoreless innings and recording a win. On November 10, Adams was removed from the 40-man roster and sent outright to the Triple–A El Paso Chihuahuas; he elected free agency the same day.\nArizona Diamondbacks.\nOn January 25, 2023, Adams signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks organization. He was assigned to the Triple-A Reno Aces to begin the year, where he made 12 appearances and recorded a 2.84 ERA with 20 strikeouts and 3 saves in innings pitched. On May 20, Adams's contract was selected to the major league roster. In 25 games for the Diamondbacks, he posted a 5.71 ERA with 22 strikeouts across innings of work. On August 1, Adams was pulled from an appearance against the San Francisco Giants after he was struck in the right ankle by a Joc Pederson comebacker. The next day, it was announced that he had suffered a fractured ankle and would miss the remainder of the season. Following the season on November 6, Adams was removed from the 40–man roster and sent outright to Triple–A Reno; he subsequently elected free agency the same day.\nNew York Mets.\nOn November 30, 2023, Adams signed a one–year, major league contract with the New York Mets. However, he was designated for assignment on February 6, 2024, in order to make room for Jake Diekman on the 40-man roster. On February 11, he cleared waivers and accepted an outright assignment to the Triple–A Syracuse Mets.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn March 24, 2024, the Mets traded Adams to the Oakland Athletics in exchange for cash considerations. He was subsequently added the team's 40-man roster, replacing the injured Trevor Gott.\nPitching style.\nIn 2014, a report on \"Scout.com\" took note of Adams' \"loud, earth-shattering slider\", describing it as a pitch \"like hardly any other\". Adams also throws a fastball in the 92-94 mph range. Despite an effective two-pitch mix, Adams has been noted for problems with his command, walking more than seven batters per nine innings in the first half of the 2017 season with the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs. Adams' problems with control came back in the 2021 MLB season. He led the league in hit by pitches (HBP) with 24 HBPs despite being a reliever with fewer innings pitched than most other pitchers."

        "text": "José Antonio Alvarado (born May 21, 1995) is a Venezuelan professional baseball pitcher for the Philadelphia Phillies of Major League Baseball (MLB). Alvarado previously played for the Tampa Bay Rays, having signed there as an international free agent in 2012. Alvarado made his major league debut in 2017.\nEarly life.\nAlvarado was born in Maracaibo, Venezuela. During Alvarado's childhood, Maracaibo was known for its high crime rates, including kidnappings and assault, and he attempted to stay out of trouble while garnering a sense of fearlessness. Alvarado dropped out of school at the age of 14 in order to support his family through farm work. He preferred soccer to baseball, but was turned onto the latter sport when his physical education teacher told him that, as a left-handed athlete, he had a future as a pitcher.\nProfessional career.\nMinor league career.\nThe Tampa Bay Rays took an interest in Alvarado when he pitched at a showcase for Major League Baseball (MLB) scouts, and he was invited to pitch at the Rays' Venezuelan academy. The Rays signed him in 2012, as part of an ongoing push from the club to pursue international baseball talent. He made his professional baseball debut in 2012 as a 17-year-old in the Venezuelan Summer League (VSL). In 12 games and 26 innings pitched, Alvarado posted a 2-3 win–loss record with a 3.81 earned run average (ERA) and 20 strikeouts. The following year, he returned to the VSL, going 1–8 with a 1.97 ERA and 54 strikeouts in 13 starts and innings. In 2015, he was taken to the US for a season with the Gulf Coast League Rays. There, Alvarado posted a 1–5 record with a 3.79 ERA and 46 strikeouts in 12 games and innings.\nIn 2015, Alvarado still played in rookie league, and struggled mightily in 5 starts, posting an ERA of 9.53 as he walked 13 batters in 17 innings. In 2016, Alvarado converted to the bullpen and improved dramatically, posting a 3.06 ERA between Low-A and High-A with an 85/55 K/BB ratio in innings, but walked 7.4 batters per nine innings. The Rays added him to their 40-man roster after the 2016 season. In 2017, he played for the Double-A Montgomery Biscuts, posting a 2–1 record in 9 games ( innings) with an ERA of 2.38.\nTampa Bay Rays.\nOn May 3, 2017, Alvarado was called up directly from Montgomery to give the Rays a left-handed option out of the bullpen, at 21 years of age. He made his debut the same day, getting hit hard and allowing 3 runs on 2 hits in his only inning of work. Alvarado calmed down after his debut, only allowing one run in his next 10 appearances. On August 4, 2017, he pitched an immaculate inning against the Milwaukee Brewers in a game at Tropicana Field. Alvarado finished the season 0–3 with a 3.64 ERA in innings.\nIn 2018, Alvarado was a key contributor to the Rays bullpen, specifically in late, high leverage situations. Overall, he finished the season with a 2.39 ERA (ranking second on his team), 8 saves (third on team), 31 holds (tied for most in the American League (AL) with teammate Chaz Roe), an 11.3 strikeouts per nine IP (highest on team) in 64 innings over 70 games (second most on team). \nDuring the 2019 season, Alvarado struggled with inconsistency and injury, appearing in only 35 games after leaving the United States in June for family reasons, being placed on the 10-day injured list with a right oblique strain, and spending the entire month of September on the injured list with left elbow inflammation. In 30 innings, Alvarado posted a 4.80 ERA, striking out 39 batters while walking 27 — nearly one an inning.\nOn August 15, 2020, Alvarado was placed on the 10-day injured list with left shoulder inflammation. He was later shifted to the 45-day injured list and missed the remainder of the season. On the year for Tampa Bay, Alvarado pitched to a 6.00 ERA with 13 strikeouts across 9 innings pitched in as many appearances.\nPhiladelphia Phillies.\nOn December 29, 2020, Alvarado was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies as part of a three-team trade that sent Garrett Cleavinger from Philadelphia to the Los Angeles Dodgers and minor leaguer Dillon Paulson and a player to be named later from the Dodgers to the Rays. In 2021, Alvarado recorded a 4.20 ERA and struck out 68 batters while walking 47 in innings of relief. He had the highest walk rate of any pitcher with more than 50 innings that year (18.7%).\nOn March 22, 2022, Alvarado signed a $1.9 million contract with the Phillies, avoiding salary arbitration.\nIn the 2022 regular season he was 4–2 with two saves and a 3.18 ERA in 51.0 innings over 59 relief appearances, averaging 4.2 walks and 14.3 strikeouts per nine innings. He appeared in twelve games of the postseason for the Phillies that year, recording three holds, a win in Game 5 of the pennant clinching game, and went one-for-two in saves. In Game 4 of the 2022 World Series, he was sent out to defend a precarious situation in relief of Aaron Nola: bases loaded and no outs in the fifth inning with Yordan Alvarez at the plate. His first pitch landed squarely in the waist of Alvarez, scoring in a run. Alvarado then allowed a double to right from Alex Bregman to score two runs before a sacrifice fly by Kyle Tucker and a hit by Yuli Gurriel capper the scoring at five runs, which proved key in the 5–0 win by Houston. In Game 6, he was sent out in another tough situation to relieve Zach Wheeler in the sixth inning: two on base, one out in a 1–0 game, with Yordan Alvarez looming at the plate. On the third pitch, Alvarez hit a towering 450 foot shot to center field to give the Astros the lead. Alvarado struck out a batter before walking one on his way out of the mound as the Phillies soon lost 4–1 to lose the Series.\nOn February 17, 2023, Alvarado signed a three-year, $21.5 million contract extension with the Phillies that included a $9 million club option for 2026.\nScouting profile.\nAlvarado is tall and weighs . He throws a sinker, which ranges from 98 to 102 mph, and a cutter that can range from 89 to 96 mph. After posting a 7.62 ERA through 17 appearances in 2022, he was optioned to Triple-A to improve his command. When he returned to the big leagues, he began exclusively using the Cutter as his primary off-speed pitch and abandoned his curveball. This change greatly benefited him, and as of August 27, 2022, Alvarado has generated a 55.3% whiff rate on his cutter, throwing it 43.3% of the time, much more than his previous 16.3% usage rate of the pitch last year. \nPersonal life.\nAlvarado grew up in Venezuela. He likes to hunt 3-foot iguanas and paca, with a slingshot. Alvarado has two children, a daughter and a son."

        "text": "The SMU Mustangs women's volleyball team is the NCAA Division I women's volleyball team at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. The program began its first season in 1996. Its current head coach is Samantha Erger. Their first head coach was Lisa Seifert, who led the program from 1996–2021. She finished her career with 415 wins, the second-most of any coach at SMU.\nIn SMU Volleyball's 2016 post-season, the Mustangs beat the Texas A&amp;M Aggies in 3 straight sets (25-23, 25-23, 25-18) to advance to the second round of the NCAA tournament. This was the Mustangs second year to qualify for the tournament and first year to advance to the second round where they played the University of Texas Longhorns. SMU became the first American Athletic Conference Team to win an NCAA match after losing to Purdue in the first round of the NCAA tournament in 2015.\nThe 2019 season was another success. It resulted in a west-side AAC championship for the Mustangs. After winning their side of the conference, the Mustangs attended the AAC tournament when they were swept by UCF. Shortly after this season ended COVID-19 came into play. All volleyball operations were halted in March 2020 and the Mustangs didn't practice for 5 months. Their 2020 fall season got postponed until the spring of 2021."

But due to local zoning laws such an establishment was prohibited, so the search was extended all over the Severn River. Finally, three cottages on the water at the end of First Street in Eastport were bought and in 1958, a dock was constructed and the boats of the five initial centerboard fleets (Penguins, Comets, National One-Designs, Severn One-Designs and International 14's) were launched.\nFleets.\nOne-Design racing club fleets include:\nExternal links.\n "

The defending titlist was Martin Fourcade of France.\nThe small crystal globe winner for the category was Martin Fourcade of France.\nCompetition format.\nIn the mass start, all biathletes start at the same time and the first across the finish line wins. In this competition, the distance is skied over five laps; there are four bouts of shooting (two prone and two standing, in that order) with the first shooting bout being at the lane corresponding to the competitor's bib number (bib #10 shoots at lane #10 regardless of position in race), with the rest of the shooting bouts being on a first-come, first-served basis (if a competitor arrives at the lane in fifth place, they shoot at lane 5). As in the sprint and pursuit, competitors must ski one penalty loop for each miss. Here again, to avoid unwanted congestion, World Cup Mass starts are held with only the 30 top ranking athletes on the start line (half that of the pursuit) as here all contestants start simultaneously."

The tour included the first Tests that Sarfaraz Ahmed of Pakistan captained following the retirement of Misbah-ul-Haq. The tour also featured a T20I match in Pakistan, the first time that Sri Lanka had visited the country since 2009.\nOn 27 September 2017, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) named umpires for the Test and ODI fixtures. The second Test match was played as a day/night fixture, the first day/night Test for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka won the Test series 2–0. It was Pakistan's first whitewash in the United Arab Emirates, and only their second whitewash in a home series, after losing 3–0 to Australia in October 2002. Pakistan won the ODI series 5–0. Sri Lanka became the first side to be whitewashed 5–0 three times in ODIs in the same calendar year, after previously losing to South Africa in January and India in August.\nReturn to Pakistan.\nIn August 2017, Thilanga Sumathipala, president of Sri Lanka Cricket, said that he would like to play at least one of the three T20I matches in Lahore, Pakistan during October. In March 2009, the Sri Lanka cricket team were attacked by terrorists while travelling to the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. Since then, the only Test side to visit Pakistan had been Zimbabwe, when they toured during May 2015. Two members of Sri Lanka's current team, Chamara Kapugedera and Suranga Lakmal were on the bus during the 2009 terrorist attack, and both could have been selected for the T20I squad for this series.\nIn September 2017, the fixtures were confirmed, with the final T20I match of the series scheduled to be played in Lahore. Sri Lanka Cricket said that players have a \"contractual obligation\" to play the match in Lahore, but it was unlikely to issue penalties to any player who chose not to visit Pakistan. However, on 14 October 2017, the Sri Lankan team expressed their reluctance to travel to Pakistan, requesting that the fixture be moved to a neutral venue. On 16 October 2017, Sri Lanka Cricket confirmed that the fixture in Lahore would go ahead as planned, but their limited-overs captain, Upul Tharanga, had pulled out of the match. Despite the concerns from the players, team manager Asanka Gurusinha felt that a competitive squad would be named. On 19 October 2017, Sri Lanka's chief selector, Graham Labrooy, said that players who do not travel to Lahore would be unlikely to be selected for the other two T20I fixtures. The squad for the T20I fixtures was named two days later, with Thisara Perera selected as captain.\nThe Sri Lankan squad arrived in Lahore under \"extraordinary\" security and made their way to the team's hotel in a bomb-proof bus. Ahead of the T20I in Lahore, Cricket Sri Lanka's president Thilanga Sumathipala said that the team was privileged to be in Pakistan and that he would help support the country in hosting more tours. Najam Sethi, then chairman of the PCB, said that this fixture would be the start of international cricket's return to the country, and that he expected every country to play in Pakistan by the end of 2020. Pakistan went on to win the T20I series 3–0. Following the conclusion of the match, the Asian Cricket Council announced that the 2018 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup would be played in Pakistan in April. However, the tournament was moved to December 2018, with Pakistan and Sri Lanka co-hosting the event.\nSquads.\nAhead of the ODI series, Mohammad Amir was ruled out of Pakistan's squad with an injury, with Usman Shinwari added as his replacement. Nuwan Pradeep was ruled out of Sri Lanka's ODI squad with an injury, with Lahiru Gamage added as his replacement. Ahead of the third ODI, Sadeera Samarawickrama was added to Sri Lanka's ODI squad."

James Anderson was named as England's vice-captain for the Test series in Stokes' absence.

Additionally, England played a warm-up game during the tour which featured six players not included in the Test squad (Ben Duckett, Keaton Jennings, Daniel Lawrence, Jack Leach, Liam Livingstone, and Mark Wood), although Joe Clarke replaced Duckett himself after an off-field incident with James Anderson.\nAustralia delayed the naming of its squad for the first two Tests until 17 November 2017, and selected Cameron Bancroft to replace Matthew Renshaw. Tim Paine returned to the team after a seven-year absence, ahead of Matthew Wade and Peter Nevill.

England's Chris Woakes was ruled out of the fifth Test due to injury.\nPrior to the ODI series, Dawid Malan was added to England's squad, replacing Ben Stokes.

Three Tests were originally planned, but it was reduced to two by New Zealand Cricket (NZC) to conform to the expected tour make-up when the ICC World Test Championship is implemented. Ahead of the Test series, a three-day tour match was planned, which started on 25 November 2017.\nNew Zealand won the Test series 2–0 and the ODI series 3–0. New Zealand also won the T20I series 2–0, after the second match was washed out with no result possible. It was the first time since January 2000 that the West Indies failed to win a single match during a tour to New Zealand. With the 2–0 victory in the T20I series, New Zealand returned to the top of the ICC T20I Championship.\nSquads.\nAhead of the first Test, Tom Blundell and Lockie Ferguson were added to New Zealand's squad as cover for BJ Watling and Tim Southee respectively. George Worker was added to New Zealand's squad ahead of the first test after Tim Southee was ruled out due to a family reason. Southee returned for the second Test, following the birth of his child. The West Indies captain Jason Holder was suspended for the second Test, after maintaining a slow over-rate. Kraigg Brathwaite was named as the captain of the West Indies for the second Test in Holder's absence.\nFor New Zealand, Kane Williamson and Tim Southee were selected only for the first ODI with Neil Broom and Mitchell Santner replacing them for the last two ODIs.

        "text": "The India cricket team toured South Africa in January and February 2018 to play three Tests, six One Day Internationals (ODIs) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. In January 2017, Cricket South Africa (CSA) revealed that this tour would replace the scheduled visit by Sri Lanka due to costs and scheduling congestion. The Test series was played for the Freedom Trophy, with South Africa winning the trophy following victories in the first two Tests. South Africa went on to win the Test series 2–1. It was the first Test series of three matches or more in which all 40 wickets fell in each match of the series. With India's win the third Test, they retained the number one place in the ICC Test Championship, taking an unassailable lead before the April 2018 cut-off date for next season's rankings.\nIn August 2017, it was announced that the traditional Boxing Day Test at Kingsmead will not take place, as India's home series against Sri Lanka will not conclude until 24 December 2017. The following month it was announced that tour would likely start on 5 January 2018. CSA confirmed the fixtures in September 2017. Before the Test matches, India were scheduled to play in a two-day warm-up match at Boland Park, Paarl. However, this was cancelled, as India opted to do training sessions instead of the match.\nThe Test series marked Dale Steyn's return to international cricket. He last played in a Test match for South Africa in November 2016 against Australia in Perth, where he suffered a shoulder injury. However, on day two of the first Test, Steyn damaged his left heel. This ruled him out of the rest of the Test, with a recovery time of 4 to 6 weeks. Two days later, he was ruled out of the rest of the series.\nDuring the first ODI, South Africa's captain, Faf du Plessis, suffered a finger injury and was ruled out of the remaining ODI matches. Aiden Markram was named as South Africa's captain for the remaining ODI fixtures, becoming the second-youngest South African to lead South Africa in ODIs.\nIndia ensured an ODI series victory after beating South Africa by 73 runs in the fifth match, after they had already won the first three fixtures. This resulted in India's first ODI series win in South Africa, with India maintaining their number one ranking in the ICC ODI Championship. India went on to win the ODI series 5–1. Virat Kohli scored the most runs in a bilateral ODI series by a player, with 558. India were also victorious in the T20I matches, winning the series 2–1.\nSquads.\nDuanne Olivier and Lungi Ngidi were added to South Africa's squad for the second Test after Dale Steyn suffered an injury during the first Test. Dinesh Karthik was called up as replacement to India's Test squad for Wriddhiman Saha after Saha was ruled out of the series due to an injury in training. Temba Bavuma suffered a finger injury in a domestic one-day game and was ruled out of South Africa's squad ahead of the third and final Test. South Africa's AB de Villiers was ruled out of first three ODIs due to a finger injury. He was added back into South Africa's squad for the final three matches.\nFollowing the first ODI, Faf du Plessis was ruled out of South Africa's squad for the remaining ODI matches and the T20I series, after suffering a finger injury. Du Plessis was replaced by Farhaan Behardien in the ODI squad and Heinrich Klaasen was added to South Africa's squad as a reserve wicket-keeper. Aiden Markram was named as captain of South Africa for the remaining ODIs in du Plessis' absence. South Africa's Quinton de Kock suffered an injury during the second ODI and was ruled out of the rest of the ODI matches and the T20I series.\nAB de Villiers was ruled out of South Africa's squad for the T20I series after suffering an injury before the fifth ODI match."

Prior to the tour, both teams played in a tri-series, along with Zimbabwe.\nIn December 2017, Shakib Al Hasan was named the new captain of Bangladesh's Test squad, replacing Mushfiqur Rahim. However, ahead of the Test series, Shakib suffered a hand injury during the final of the 2017–18 Bangladesh Tri-Nation Series, and Mahmudullah was named as captain of Bangladesh for the first Test. It was Mahmudullah's first Test as captain and he became the tenth player to lead Bangladesh in Tests. Mahmudullah also captained Bangladesh for the second Test, as Shakib was still recovering from his injury. Sri Lanka won the Test series 1–0, after the first match was drawn.\nShakib Al Hasan was also ruled out of the T20I series, and Mahmudullah once again named as captain in his place. Sri Lanka won the T20I series 2–0.\nSquads.\nSunzamul Islam and Tanbir Hayder were added to Bangladesh's squad for the first Test following the news of Shakib Al Hasan's injury.

        "text": "The Australia cricket team toured South Africa between February and April 2018 to play four Test matches. It was the first four-Test series between the two teams since South Africa's readmission. Prior to the start of the tour, South African fast-bowler Morné Morkel announced that he would retire from international cricket at the end of the series. During the third Test, Morkel became the fifth bowler for South Africa to take 300 Test wickets.\nThe series was known for an Australian ball-tampering scandal, culminating in the bans of three Australian cricketers and the restructure of the Australian cricket governing body. During the third Test, Australian batsman Cameron Bancroft was charged with ball tampering. Captain Steve Smith and Bancroft admitted the ball tampering to match referee Andy Pycroft and the media. Consequently, Smith and vice-captain David Warner stood down from the team leadership, and wicket-keeper Tim Paine was appointed acting captain for the remainder of the match.\nOn 27 March 2018, Smith, Warner and Bancroft were all suspended by Cricket Australia and sent home, with Paine named as the captain for the fourth and final Test. The following day, Cricket Australia banned Smith and Warner for one year, with Bancroft receiving a nine-month ban. Although Warner will not be considered for a leadership position in the future, Smith and Bancroft will not be considered to leadership positions for a minimum of 12 months after the completion of their bans. After the three players had returned home, Darren Lehmann, Australia's coach, announced that he would step down from his role after the conclusion of the fourth Test in Johannesburg.\nSouth Africa went on to win the Test series 3–1. It was the first time that South Africa had beaten Australia at home since 1970.\nSquads.\nJackson Bird was replaced in Australia's squad by Chadd Sayers before the tour began due to injury. South Africa's Kagiso Rabada was given a two-match ban by the International Cricket Council (ICC) after he made contact with Australia's captain, Steve Smith, during the second Test, initially ruling him out of the rest of the series. On 20 March 2018, Rabada's two-match ban was overturned by the ICC, therefore allowing him to play in the rest of the series. For the last two Tests of the series, Duanne Olivier and Chris Morris were added to South Africa's squad.\nFollowing the suspension of Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft after the third Test, Joe Burns, Glenn Maxwell and \nMatt Renshaw were added to Australia's squad for the fourth Test.\nTest series.\n3rd Test.\nBall tampering.\nOn the third day of the third Test, Australia's Cameron Bancroft was shown on television coverage, also shown live at the ground, to have tampered with the ball with a small, yellow object. Bancroft later revealed the object to be a short length of yellow adhesive tape to which dirt and grit had adhered, forming an abrasive surface, though four days later, Cricket Australia confirmed that the object was actually sandpaper. At the end of the day's play, both Bancroft and captain Steve Smith admitted to ball tampering, with Smith knowing of the plan in advance of Bancroft's actions. Andy Pycroft, the match referee, charged Bancroft with a Level 2 offence of attempting to alter the condition of the ball. Smith said it was a \"big mistake\" but stated he would not be standing down.\nSmith and vice-captain David Warner subsequently stood aside from leadership roles for the remainder of the Test, with Tim Paine taking over as acting captain. The International Cricket Council (ICC) suspended Smith for one match, handed him four demerit points and fined him 100% of his match fee. Cameron Bancroft was handed three demerit points and fined 75% of his match fee.\nOn 27 March 2018, Cricket Australia CEO James Sutherland announced that as a result of the preliminary investigation Smith, Warner and Bancroft had been charged with bringing the game into disrepute, suspended and sent home. Matt Renshaw, Joe Burns and Glenn Maxwell were recalled to the squad for the fourth Test to replace them. On 28 March, Cricket Australia released their findings and the sanctions to be imposed. Smith and Bancroft respectively received 12 and 9 month bans from international and domestic cricket in Australia, and neither would be considered for a leadership role for a further 12 months after that ban finishes. Warner received an identical 12 month ban, and would never be considered again for a leadership position. All three were encouraged to return to club level cricket to reconnect with the general cricket community."

        "text": "The Sri Lanka cricket team toured India in November and December 2017. The original schedule had the tour consisting of three Tests, five One Day Internationals (ODIs) and one Twenty20 International (T20I) match starting in February 2018.\nIn March 2017, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the dates for the 2018 Nidahas Trophy, a limited-overs tri-series tournament featuring Sri Lanka, India and Bangladesh. This was scheduled to take place in March 2018. The SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that some of the scheduled limited-overs matches fixtures in this series would now be played in the Nidahas Trophy. The revised schedule of the tour now has three Tests, three ODIs and three T20Is. Ahead of the Test series, a two-day tour match was played between the India Board President XI and Sri Lanka.\nIn August 2017, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary mentioned that the Tests would be played in Kolkata, Nagpur and Delhi. The ODI venues would be in Dharamshala, Mohali and Visakhapatnam and the three T20 games would be played in Cuttack, Indore and Mumbai. Moreover, Choudhary said that a second reason for Sri Lanka's advanced arrival was the cancellation of the proposed series between India and Pakistan.\nIn October 2017, Virat Kohli was named as India's captain for the Test series. However, in November 2017, he was rested for the ODIs as well as T20Is in preparation for India's tour to South Africa at the end of the year, with Rohit Sharma named as captain. On 29 November 2017, Thisara Perera was named as Sri Lanka's captain for the ODI and T20I matches, replacing Upul Tharanga.\nIndia won the Test series 1–0, after the first and third matches were drawn. India won the ODI series 2–1, their eighth consecutive series win since beating Zimbabwe in June 2016. India won the T20I series 3–0.\nSquads.\nHardik Pandya was initially named in India's Test squad, but was later withdrawn from the series to manage his workload. Ahead of the second Test, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Shikhar Dhawan were released from the team due to personal reasons. Vijay Shankar was named as Bhuvneshwar Kumar’s replacement in the squad. However, ahead of third Test, Dhawan was added back in India's Test squad. Rangana Herath was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad for the third Test, with Jeffrey Vandersay replacing him.\nAhead of the first ODI, Kedar Jadhav injured his hamstring and was ruled out of the series. He was replaced by Washington Sundar in India's squad.\nDuring the second T20I, Angelo Mathews injured his hamstring and was ruled out of Sri Lanka's squad for the last T20I.\nTest series.\n3rd Test.\nSmog.\nDuring the second day of the third Test, the Smog in Delhi forced the Sri Lanka cricketers to halt play and wear anti-pollution masks. Cricketer Lahiru Gamage was reported to have breathing shortness. Nic Pothas, coach of the Sri Lankan cricket team, reported that Dhananjaya de Silva and Suranga Lakmal had vomited regularly due to the severe pollution at the ground. There was a haltage of play between 12:32pm to 12:49pm, which caused Indian coach Ravi Shastri to come out to consult with the on-field umpires. BCCI president C. K. Khanna accused the Sri Lankan team of making fuss while Indian spectators called the team \"melodramatic\". On day 4, India's Mohammed Shami was also seen vomiting on the field.\nFollowing the match, both participating countries criticised the choice to play the Test in Delhi with the high levels of pollution. The Sri Lanka manager Asanka Gurusinha said that both teams were using oxygen cylinders in their dressing rooms due to breathing difficulties, and suggested the use of air-quality meters in future fixtures. President of the Indian Medical Association, KK Agarwal, said that playing in such conditions could result in lung and heart disease, and recommended the inclusion of atmospheric pollution as a factor in the assessment criteria for a match."

        "text": "The 1986 UAAP men's basketball tournament was the 49th year of the men's tournament of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP)'s basketball championship. Hosted by National University, the UP Fighting Maroons defeated the UE Red Warriors in the finals taking their first UAAP men's basketball championship in 47 years. Prior to the start of the season, De La Salle University was admitted as the eighth member school of the league.\nElimination round.\nTournament format:\nFinals.\nNumber 1 seed UE only has to win once, while number 2 seed UP has to win twice, to clinch the championship.\nAfter 47 years of frustration, the State University, which is more famous for producing personalities from the various spectrum of the society, finally made a name for itself in the field of varsity basketball.\nAfter five years of bench bitterness, Lipa, the new miracle man of amateur caging, realized an elusive dream which had slipped from his hand twice in the last five years.\nThe dying seconds of the winner-take-all UP-University of the East clash seemed a lifetime for Lipa, the players and the throngs of pro-Maroons crowd. The UP lead was already insurmountable, yet in everyone's mind was the wounds of the 1983 championship to Far Eastern University.\nThe fans were kept at the edge of their seats by the last ditch, desperate fullcourt press by the dethroned Warriors, proud owners of 18 UAAP titles. A pocket of UP supporters at the gallery were undecided whether to unfurl the championship streamer or not. The Maroons were leading FEU in 1983, only to lose by a slim margin. Finally, the final horn blared and all frustrations were erased."

        "text": "Basketball in Canada dates back to the 20th century. Basketball is played year-round by men and women and various levels of competition. Several professional basketball leagues have teams based in Canada.\nHistory.\nJames Naismith, a Canadian who moved to the United States, invented basketball in Springfield, Massachusetts in the 1890s. This new sport soon became popular as an indoor sport that needed a minimal equipment, gaining popularity at high schools and colleges in Canada.\nThe Toronto Huskies were co-founders of the Basketball Association of America, a forerunner of the NBA, but disbanded after the first season.\nIn Canada, the sport has long lived in the shadow of ice hockey, but in the early 21st century the sport saw a rise in popularity, partly due to the Toronto Raptors, an expansion National Basketball Association (NBA) franchise established in 1995. The Vancouver Grizzlies was another NBA expansion franchise that was based in Vancouver, British Columbia from 1995 to 2001, when it was relocated to Memphis, Tennessee.\nThe National Basketball League was played for one and a half seasons in 1993 and 1994.\nIn 2011, a new domestic league was formed, the National Basketball League of Canada (NBL Canada), with the London Lightning won its first two national titles. NBL Canada presently operate 10 franchises throughout Canada. The league was the first fully domestic professional basketball league to operate in Canada since the National Basketball League, which operated from 1993 to 1994.\nThe Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL) is a professional tier 1 basketball league which began play in 2019 season.\nThe Toronto Raptors won their first NBA championship in 2019, the first champion outside of the United States.\nCollegiate basketball.\nStudents in Canada may participate in varsity basketball teams in colleges and universities throughout Canada. U Sports is the national sports governing body for university sports in Canada, whereas the Canadian Colleges Athletic Association is the national governing body for colleges. The winners of U Sports' annual men's basketball championship are awarded the W. P. McGee Trophy, whereas the winners of the women's annual basketball championship are awarded the Bronze Baby trophy. Growing numbers of Canadian men and women play college basketball in the United States' National Collegiate Athletic Association.\nProfessional basketball.\nPresently, only one team in the NBA is based in Canada, the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors also operate a minor league professional team, the Raptors 905 of the NBA G League. Both Raptors franchises are based in the Greater Toronto Area. In addition to the NBA, there are three other professional basketball leagues which have a team based in Canada, the National Basketball League of Canada, Canadian Elite Basketball League, and the American Basketball Association.\nHowever, a number of Canadians play in the NBA including Chris Boucher, Andrew Wiggins, Brandon Clarke, Chris Duarte, Cory Joseph, Dalano Banton, Dillon Brooks, Dwight Powell, Ignas Brazdeikis, Jamal Murray, Joshua Primo, Kelly Olynyk, Khem Birch, Lindell Wigginton, Luguentz Dort, Oshae Brissett, Nickeil Alexander-Walker, Nik Stauskas, RJ Barrett, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Trey Lyles, and Tristan Thompson. In addition, four Canadians are playing in the Women's National Basketball Association including Adut Bulgak, Kayla Alexander, Kia Nurse, and Natalie Achonwa. Canadian collegiate athletes playing basketball may choose to play professionally overseas after university or college. In addition, there are several Canadians playing professionally for various professional basketball organizations throughout North America. The most prominent player is Steve Nash, 2-time NBA Most Valuable Player and 2-time FIBA AmeriCup Most Valuable Player.\nNotable Canadians in the Women's National Basketball Association include Tammy Sutton-Brown, Kayla Alexander, Stacey Dales, Natalie Achonwa and Adut Bulgak.\nNational competition.\nCanada has competed in a number of international competitions contested by national teams, most notably the Summer Olympics, and tournaments organized by FIBA, including the Basketball World Cup, and the Women's Basketball World Cup.\nThe Canadian men's national basketball team has made nine appearances at the Summer Olympic basketball tournament, winning silver at the 1936 Summer Olympics. The men's national team has also made 13 appearances to the FIBA World Cup. The Canadian women's national basketball team have made six appearances to the Summer Olympics, and 10 to the Women's World Cup. The women's national team won bronze in the 1979 and 1986 Women's World Cup tournaments.\nIn addition to the national team, Canada Basketball also manages a number of youth teams, including the women's under-17, men's under-17, women's under-19, and the men's under-19 teams."

Sanda Toma, the winner of the 1980 Olympic event and 1981 world champion, had since retired. World championship medallists competing in this event were Beryl Mitchell from Great Britain, who had come second in 1981, and Valeria Răcilă of Romania and Stephanie Foster of New Zealand, who had won silver and bronze in 1982, respectively. Of all those, the Romanian was regarded as the favourite. Another competitor to be regarded as one of the favourites was María Fernanda de la Fuente of Mexico, who had come second in the 1983 Pan American Games.\nResults.\nHeats.\nThe winner of each heat advanced to the semi-finals. All others went to the repechage. The heats were raced on 30 July.\nRepechage.\nThe first three of each heat advanced to the semi-final. The remaining rowers were eliminated from the competition. The repechages were raced on 1 August.

        "text": "The 2016 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 33rd running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2016 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on November 5, 2016 at Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, California with a purse of $6,000,000.\nCalifornia Chrome, who was the top-ranked Thoroughbred racehorse in the world, was the favorite for the race after an undefeated season. He led for most of the race but was caught near the finish line by Arrogate, a late developing three-year-old.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nCalifornia Chrome (program #4) was the even money favorite on the morning line for the Classic after a perfect season of six wins from six starts, including the Dubai World Cup, Pacific Classic and Awesome Again Stakes. He was ranked number one on the Longines World's Best Racehorse Rankings and held the North American earnings record. California Chrome was also the 2014 Horse of the Year after winning the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. His trainer Art Sherman said, \"He's more mature, bigger, stronger, and you can see it in the way he's running. He's pretty well focused. He's kind of awesome to watch, to be honest with you.\"\nArrogate (p #10) was the second choice at 5-2 on the morning line, based on his record-setting win in the Travers Stakes in late August. The lightly raced three-year-old was trained by Bob Baffert, who won the Classic in 2014 with Bayern and in 2015 with American Pharoah. The Classic was only his second stakes race appearance.\nFrosted (p #2) was the third choice at 3-1 on the morning line. Beaten by California Chrome in the Dubai World Cup, Frosted rebounded with noteworthy wins in the Metropolitan Handicap and Whitney before being upset in the Woodward.\nThe 9-horse field also included:\nShaman Ghost, winner of the Brooklyn and Woodward, scratched the day before the race.\nRace Description.\nCalifornia Chrome broke well and was urged by jockey Victor Espinoza to the early lead. Arrogate broke poorly from the outside post position but quickly moved to the middle of the pack, then up to third. With a quarter of a mile remaining, Arrogate moved into second, trailing California Chrome by a length and a half. Espinoza looked back at the field then set California Chrome down for the stretch drive. Arrogate was also urged on by his jockey Mike Smith and started to draw clear of the remaining horses, but did not initially make up any ground on the leader. Entering the last sixteenth of a mile, California Chrome still led by about a length but Arrogate had hit his best stride and was gaining. Arrogate finally assumed the lead in the final strides and won by half a length. The time of 2:00.11 was very good on a fast track that was playing slower than normal, earning Arrogate a Beyer Speed Figure of 120.\nIt was trainer Bob Baffert's third consecutive victory in the Classic, one he doubted Arrogate could pull off turning into the stretch. \"I thought there was no way. California Chrome is a great horse. I didn't think we could run him down\", he said. \"I thought he'd get second. I'm thinking, 'At least he showed up.' But then I saw Mike getting down on him, and that big stride of his. That was an incredible race by two incredible horses.\"\n\"That winner is the real McCoy\", said Art Sherman, trainer of California Chrome. \"I knew he was the one we had to beat, but I didn't know how good he was.\"\nResults.\nSource: Equibase\nTimes: – 0:23.28; – 0:47.15; – 1:10.96; mile – 1:35.72; final – 2:00.11.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.28) (:23.87) (:23.81) (:24.76) (:24.39)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

After the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Famagusta's residents were forced to leave the city and move elsewhere in Cyprus. The women's volleyball team stayed for a short term in Larnaca, but was re-established in 1987 in Nicosia, by Anorthosis' people who moved there after the war. The first members of the team were schoolgirls, but gradually the team grew and became competitive in the first division of women's volleyball. Their first championship came in 2002, and in 2004 Anorthosis managed to win both the championship and National Cup. Since then, Anorthosis has been one of the top four teams of the Cypriot championship, and has won seven championships, seven National Cups and nine Super Cups. That makes Anorthosis the most successful Cypriot women's team of the last 20 years.\nCurrent volleyball squad.\nCoach: Dragan Djordjevic Serbia &lt;br&gt;\nAss.

A total of 185 pre-entries were announced on October 26 in what was considered a highly competitive year in most divisions. The races, all of which were Grade I, took place on November 4 and 5 at Santa Anita Racetrack in Arcadia, California and were telecast by NBC. The Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North America racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December.\nThe most anticipated events were the Classic and Distaff. The Classic pitted the five-year-old California Chrome, undefeated in 2016, against Arrogate, a late developing three-year-old, with Arrogate prevailing by half a length. The Distaff featured a face-off between three Eclipse Award winners: Songbird (2015 champion two-year-old filly, undefeated in her career before the Breeders' Cup), Stellar Wind (2015 champion three-year-old filly) and Beholder (2015 champion older female). Beholder prevailed over Songbird by a nose.\nBreeders' Cup Challenge series.\nThe Breeders' Cup Challenge is a series of races that provide the winners of designated races with automatic \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Forty-five entrants in the Breeders' Cup qualified via the Challenge series, which was particularly important as seven of the Breeders' Cup races were oversubscribed, in that there were more entries than available space. A maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Dirt Mile) are allowed to start in each race. Winners of the Challenge races are given automatic entries, while other pre-entries were ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts.\nLead-up.\nIn 2016, Santa Anita hosted the Breeders' Cup for a record ninth time. In preparation for the event, Santa Anita installed a new turf course over the summer of 2016. Early reviews were positive: the jockeys felt the course was very fast but safe and fair. \"It's like a carpet right now,\" said jockey Kent Desormeaux. \"It's pristine. It's incredible. But we'll see how it holds up.\"\nNBC Sports telecast the Breeders' Cup from 4 PM to 8 PM (Eastern) on both Friday and Saturday, plus the Classic was broadcast on NBC from 8 PM to 9 PM on Saturday. All races were streamed live.\nIn the Classic division, California Chrome was the clear favorite after an undefeated season that included wins in the Dubai World Cup, Pacific Classic and Awesome Again. Arrogate, a three-year-old who did not win his first race until June, was the most highly regarded contender after his record-setting win in the Travers Stakes. Frosted, who qualified for both the Dirt Mile and Classic, took the more challenging option and was the most highly regarded east coast contender.\nThe field for the Distaff was considered one of the most competitive in its history. The early favorite was Songbird, the Champion two-year-old filly of 2015. Songbird had won all 11 of her starts by a combined lengths but had never faced older horses. Stellar Wind, the 2015 three-year-old champion filly, qualified for the Breeders' Cup by beating Beholder in two \"Win and You're In\" races, the Clement L. Hirsch and Zenyatta. Beholder, a three-time Eclipse Award winner, came into the race off of a three-race losing streak, but was considered very dangerous.\nOther anticipated match ups included the Turf, where Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Found attempted to defend her 2015 win in the Turf against Flintshire, who had been dominant in the summer in North America on the Turf, and her stablemate and rival Highland Reel, who had finished second to Found in the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. Tepin attempted to defend her title in the Mile. All four races in the two-year-old division were considered wide open.\nResults.\nA record Friday crowd of 45,673 showed up on November 4 to watch the first four Breeders' Cup races, with the match up between Songbird and Beholder in the Distaff being the main draw. The race did not disappoint, with the \"Daily Racing Form\" and \"Forbes\" calling it a \"race for the ages\", while \"The Blood-Horse\" described it as \"dramatic and epic\". Songbird took the early lead with Beholder stalking a few lengths behind then moving closer around the final turn. As they entered the stretch, Beholder trailed by about a length but was closing ground with each stride. Songbird fought back and the two reached the wire together – a photo finish determined that Beholder had won by \"barely more than a whisker.\"\nCorona Del Inca was pulled up at the head of the stretch during the Distaff. Although she was able to walk into the nearby ambulance, her injuries proved extensive and she had to be euthanized.\nOn Saturday, the attendance was 72,811 – the highest single day attendance at the Breeders' Cup since it switched to a 2-day format in 2007. Common-pool wagering of $109 million for Saturday was up 3.2% compared to 2015, though short of the record of $119 million set in 2010.\nThe Classic was run in similar fashion to the Distaff, with California Chrome setting the pace and Arrogate stalking him a few lengths behind. As they rounded the final turn, Arrogate moved into second, trailing by a length and a half. California Chrome maintained that margin until mid-stretch, then Arrogate started to close, eventually winning by half a length. Keen Ice was over 10 lengths back in third. \"Deep down, I really wasn't sure if we could beat California Chrome, because I still have total respect for the horse\", said Arrogate's trainer Bob Baffert. \"Turning for home, I thought I was going to run second, but there's nothing wrong with that, because Chrome is a really good horse, and running second to him is no bad thing ... I never thought he would be able to catch Chrome.\"\nOther highlights included the Turf, in which Highland Reel went to an early lead and was able to open a large lead down the backstretch, then withstood a late run by Flintshire to win by lengths. In the Mile, longshot Tourist prevailed by half a length over Tepin, who was attempting to defend her win in the 2015 renewal. The Filly &amp; Mare Turf was won by Queen's Trust, who held off a late run by Lady Eli by a nose. And in the Juvenile, Classic Empire became the early favorite for the 2017 Kentucky Derby by prevailing over Not This Time by a neck.\nMike Smith won the Shoemaker Award for leading jockey at the event. He won three races (the Dirt Mile on Tamarkuz, the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint on Finest City and the Classic on Arrogate) and finished second in three others. Smith was the only jockey to win multiple Breeders' Cup races in 2016.\nFriday, November 4.\nSource: Equibase\nSaturday, November 5.\nSource: Equibase"

Practices officially began on September 30, 2016.\nConference membership changes.\nOnly one school joined a new conference for 2016–17:\nPre-season polls.\nThe top 25 from the AP and USA Today Coaches Polls.\nNew arenas.\nIn addition, Alabama returned women's home games to Coleman Coliseum, home to Alabama men's basketball since the venue's opening in 1968. The Crimson Tide women began play in 1974 at Foster Auditorium, and split home games between the two facilities until moving full-time into the Coliseum in 1981. The women would move back to Foster near the end of the 2010–11 season, and used that as their main venue until returning to the Coliseum.\nThis proved to be the final season for four Division I teams in their then-current venues.\nRegular season.\nEarly preseason tournament.\nTournament upsets.\nFor this list, an \"upset\" is defined as a win by a team seeded 7 or more spots below its defeated opponent.\nConference winners and tournaments.\nEach of the 32 Division I athletic conferences ends its regular season with a single-elimination tournament. The team with the best regular-season record in each conference is given the number one seed in each tournament, with tiebreakers used as needed in the case of ties for the top seeding.

This will be the first season in which the Ivy League holds a conference tournament.\nAward winners.\nAll-America teams.\nThe NCAA has never recognized a consensus All-America team in women's basketball. This differs from the practice in men's basketball, in which the NCAA uses a combination of selections by the Associated Press (AP), the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), the \"Sporting News\", and the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA) to determine a consensus All-America team. The selection of a consensus team is possible because all four organizations select at least a first and second team, with only the USBWA not selecting a third team.\nHowever, of the major selectors in women's basketball, only the AP divides its selections into separate teams. The women's counterpart to the NABC, the Women's Basketball Coaches Association (WBCA), selects a single 10-member (plus ties) team, as does the USBWA. The NCAA does not recognize \"Sporting News\" as an All-America selector in women's basketball.\nCoaching changes.\nSeveral teams changed coaches during and after the season."

        "text": "The men's coxed four competition at the 1988 Summer Olympics took place at Misari Regatta, South Korea. It was held from 19 to 24 September. There were 14 boats (71 competitors, with Romania making one substitution) from 14 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by East Germany, returning to the top of the podium after the Soviet-led boycott in 1984 prevented the East Germans from defending their 1980 Olympic title. Silver went to Romania, its first medal in the men's coxed four. New Zealand took a second consecutive bronze medal in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 18th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The coxed four was one of the four initial events introduced in 1900. It was not held in 1904 or 1908, but was held at every Games from 1912 to 1992 when it (along with the men's coxed pair) was replaced with the men's lightweight double sculls and men's lightweight coxless four.\nEast Germany was dominant in the men's coxed four, winning 7 of the last 9 World Championships (and placing second and third in the other two) as well as winning the 1980 Olympics; a boycott was seemingly the only way to keep the East Germans off the podium, as had happened at the 1984 Games. With their return to Olympic competition in 1988, they were heavily favoured. Great Britain, the defending Olympic champion from a reduced field, was a potential challenger. The Soviet Union, New Zealand, Italy, and the United States had medaled at the last two World Championships and were also outside contenders.\nSouth Korea made its debut in the event, the first nation to do so since 1976. The United States made its 15th appearance, most of any nation to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe coxed four event featured five-person boats, with four rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). The competition used the 2000 metres distance that became standard at the 1912 Olympics and which has been used ever since except at the 1948 Games.\nThe competition consisted of three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and finals) as well as a repechage. The 14 boats were divided into three heats for the quarterfinals, with 4 or 5 boats in each heat. The top three boats in each heat (9 boats total) advanced directly to the semifinals. The remaining 5 boats were placed in the repechage. The repechage featured a single heat, with the top three boats advancing to the semifinals and the remaining 2 boats (4th and 5th placers in the repechage) being eliminated (13th and 14th place overall). The 12 semifinalist boats were divided into two heats of 6 boats each. The top three boats in each semifinal (6 boats total) advanced to the \"A\" final to compete for medals and 4th through 6th place; the bottom three boats in each semifinal were sent to the \"B\" final for 7th through 12th."

She gained the 1985 World Rowing Championships title with Horvat, and won the 1986 and 1987 World Rowing Championships with Olga Homeghi. Arba and Homeghi were the only team favoured to have a chance of winning the event at the 1988 Olympics. The East German rowers were regarded as medal contenders, as they had gained medals in the event at the last three World Championships. Canada were the reigning Pan American champions."

        "text": "Dundarave Golf Course is a public golf course located in Brudenell, Prince Edward Island. The red sandstone based course was designed by two architects, Dr. Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry, and opened July 15, 1999. Dundarave has hosted golfers Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson during the 2006 Making the Connection - Legends of Golf event. Dunadrave Golf Course shares the practice grounds and clubhouse with its sister course Brudenell River Golf Course.\nHistory.\nDundarave Golf Course opened on July 15, 1999 after being delayed for about a month. The delay in opening of the course was a result of the dry weather which caused the grass to grow slower than expected. The course was designed by two different award-winning architects, Dr. Michael Hurdzan and Dana Fry. It was designed as an expansion to the Brudenell River Resort and is intertwined throughout its sister course Brudenell River Golf Course.\nIn 2007, the provincial government began looking to sell the Dundarave Golf course, along with the other three courses it owns. The reasoning behind the decision was the large expenditure of taxpayer money on course maintenance, losses from the four courses totaled $858,900 in the 2014-2015 golf season. Tourism Minister Robert Henderson was quoted saying \"Obviously, when you’re on the floor of the estimates [committee] … and you’re saying you invested in this stuff, sometimes comments get made that maybe that would have been better spent on an X-ray machine or books,\" in relation to the government's decision to sell the courses. As of the 2015 golf season no sale had been completed and the course is still maintained by the provincial government.\nCourse.\nThe course is an eighteen-hole championship golf course that is located on the Brudenell River. Dundarave Golf Course is among the top courses on Prince Edward Island, it has been rated among the best golf courses in Canada and has been rated 4 1/2 stars by SCORE Golf. It was designed to exhibit the uniqueness of Prince Edward Island's red sandstone and has a particular bunker pattern containing 120 different red sand bunkers. The fairways on this course tend to be wide, while the holes snake through the woods and along the Brudenell River.\nEvents.\nMaking the Connection - Legends of Golf.\nIn 2006 Dundarave golf course hosted the Making the Connection - Legends of Golf, an event created by IMG Canada and Tourism PEI in conjunction with The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada to raise awareness of high cholesterol and the risk of heart disease and stroke. The event took place on June 19-20th and featured a playoff between legends of golf Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson, along with a long drive exhibition by Jason Zuback. The event was broadcast both nationally and internationally and was commentated by PGA colour commentator David Feherty and PEI golfer Lorie Kane.\n2016 P.E.I. Amateur Golf Championship.\nIn July 2016 Dundarave Golf Course hosted the 2016 P.E.I. Amateur Golf Championship. The tournament was a three-round event with handicap divisions for both men and women, with the winners of tournament being the players to represent PEI at the Atlantic Golf Championship."

        "title": "2007 Breeders' Cup Classic",
        "text": "The 2007 Breeders' Cup Classic (in full, the Breeders' Cup Classic Powered by Dodge, due to sponsorship) was the 24th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2007 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program. It was run on October 27, 2007, at Monmouth Park Racetrack in Oceanport, New Jersey.\nIn a closely contested year in which the Triple Crown series was split among three different horses, Curlin emerged as the best horse of his generation with a decisive win.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m) with a purse of $5,000,000. It is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nContenders.\nCarl Nafzger, the trainer of favorite Street Sense, knew the race would be difficult for bettors to figure out. \"This is one of the best fields that could be put together\", he said. \"They’ve got everything you want – early speed, tactical speed, closers, and soundness. They’ve been beat and they’ve beat each other. There is class scattered all the way through the field. I've never really ran against this size field with this type of quality all the way through. They’ve all proved it with different styles. It's a great Classic.\"\nThe older horse division had been weakened by the injury and subsequent retirement of Invasor, the defending Classic winner and Horse of the Year. Of the remaining older horses, the most highly regarded was Lawyer Ron, who had set a track record that summer at Saratoga when winning the Whitney and followed up with a win in the Woodward and a second to Curlin in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. He was made the morning-line favorite at odds of 5-2 but drifted at racetime to nearly 4–1. Lawyer Ron raced best when he came from off the pace, but was sometimes rank at the start of races. He was not helped by drawing the inside post position.\nIn the highly talented three-year-old division, Street Sense was the slight favorite based on his wins in the Kentucky Derby and Travers Stakes. However, he had lost to Curlin in the Preakness and to Hard Spun in the Kentucky Cup Classic, his last race before the Breeders' Cup. Curlin had won the Preakness and Jockey Club Gold Cup, but had been beaten by Street Sense and Hard Spun in the Derby, and by Any Given Saturday and Hard Spun in the Haskell. Hard Spun's sole Grade I win had come in the King's Bishop Stakes, a sprint race, and his front-running style made his stamina a question mark.\nThe sole European entry in the Classic was George Washington, who had been retired after finishing sixth in the 2006 Classic but proved sub-fertile and returned to racing.\nRace Description.\nThe late-October weather in New Jersey was poor: it rained on and off for several days, stopping just in time for the Classic. The track was sloppy.\nAs expected, Hard Spun went to the early lead and set a brisk pace, followed by Lawyer Ron and Diamond Stripes. Any Given Saturday moved into third as they moved around the far turn then stalled. Curlin also started his move on the turn, moving alongside Hard Spun as they entered the stretch. Curlin struck the lead with a furlong to go and won by over four lengths. His time of 2:00.59 tied the old track record of 2:00 set in 1962 by Carry Back, and was especially impressive given the track conditions.\n\"Everything went perfectly, starting with all the speed up front\", said Curlin's jockey Robby Albarado. \"It unfolded just the way we wanted, but it also takes a hell of a horse to get this done. Curlin was there for us every step of the way.\"\nIt was the first Breeders' Cup victory for both Albarado and Steve Asmussen, Curlin's trainer, whose main concern was the sloppy track. \"He trained on an off-track half a dozen times at the most. It's been a very dry year everywhere we've been\", said Asmussen. \"But he came here in great condition. And he showed up. He ran when it mattered most. He came home like he was supposed to. He's a big-day horse.\"\nThe race was marred by the breakdown of George Washington in the stretch. On-track veterinarians found open fractures to both sesamoid bones in his off-fore and determined he could not be saved. Jockey Michael Kinane said, \"He was brave. He didn't go down. He stayed up on it. He saved me.\"\nResults.\nSource: Equibase&lt;br&gt;\nTimes: – 0:23.11; – 0:45.85; – 1:10.67; mile – 1:35.86; final – 2:00.59.&lt;br&gt;\nFractional Splits: (:23.11) (:22.74) (:24.82) (:25.19) (:24.73)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

        "text": "The men's eight competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics took place at the rowing basin on Notre Dame Island in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was held from 18 to 25 July and was won by the team from East Germany. It was East Germany's first victory in the event, improving on a bronze medal in 1972. The defending champions, New Zealand, switched places with the East Germans, taking bronze in 1972. Between them was Great Britain, taking its first men's eight medal since 1948. There were 11 boats (100 competitors, with Australia making one substitution) from 11 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event.\nBackground.\nThis was the 17th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nWhilst the East German team was considered to be the favourite, the event was wide open and many teams could have won it. The United States had in the past dominated the event and up until and including the 1964 Summer Olympics, they had won nine out of ten Olympic golds. Whilst their dominance had since waned, they were still considered possible medal contenders, as they had won the 1974 World Rowing Championships. East Germany had won the 1973 European Rowing Championships (the event was discontinued after 1973), and the 1975 World Rowing Championships, and they had won bronze at the 1972 Olympics. The New Zealand team had won the event at the previous Summer Olympics, had won bronze at the last two World Rowing Championships, and four of their 1972 Olympic rowers plus their cox returned to Montreal. Other medalists at these major rowing events were Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain.\nNo nations made their debut in the event. The United States made its 15th appearance, most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). This rowing competition consisted of two main rounds (semifinals and finals; down from three main rounds in 1927 with a smaller field), as well as a repechage round after the semifinals. The course used the 2000 metres distance that became the Olympic standard in 1912 (with the exception of 1948). Races were held in up to six lanes.\nResults.\nRepechage.\nRepechage heat 1.\nNew Zealand changed seats for seven of its eight rowers. West Germany and Japan changed seats for all eight rowers. The Soviet team changed seats 1 to 7. The team from Cuba changed seats for seven rowers.\nRepechage heat 2.\nGreat Britain changed five of its seats, including the stroke. Czechoslovakia changed seats 2 to 6. Canada changed seven of the eight seats.\nFinals.\nThe two finals were rowed on 25 July. The only team that did not change seats during the competition was the United States.\nFinal A.\nEast Germany changed five seats for the final. After Malcolm Shaw as stroke injured his back in the elimination race, Australia replaced him with Peter Shakespear for the final."

Englishman Graeme Storm won the 2017 SA Open beating Rory McIlroy in a play-off while South African golfer Brandon Stone won the 2016 SA Open.\nHistory.\nIn 1935, ten businessmen formed a company with an idea to create a country club and purchased the farm Glendower which in those days was on the edge to the town of Edenvale. The land bought was 266.7 acres in size and consisted mostly of a tree plantation. A parkland course was planned and an English golfing architect, Charles Hugh Alison, was employed to design the course and it was constructed by A.F.Tomsett. The course would open on 7 March 1937. In 1939, The Transvaal Open Championship was held at the club and won by Bobby Locke with a record score of 265. A record prize of £100 for the time, was offered by the club in 1946. In 1973, the club grounds would be declared a nature reserve. At the Volvo Toro Classic held at the course in 1975, Allan Henning scored eleven birdies in his first round. The club has hosted the South African Open in 1989, 1993, 1997, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 1997, Vijay Singh became the first non-white player to win a South African Open at the course. The BMW South African Championship was again hosted from 11–14 January 2018 at the Glendower Golf Club.\nCourse.\nIn 1985, the course was redesigned with all 18 greens reshaped and rebuilt to USGA standard, new tee positions added and extended and new water features added at eleven holes. The course has fairways with 64 bunkers, 27 on the front nine and 37 on the back nine and has water hazards on 11 of its 18 holes.\nHoles and yardages.\nChampionship Tee\n\"Out: 3,842 yards - par 36\"\n\"In: 3,722 yards- par 36\"\n\"Total: 7,564 yards- par 72\""

The Indian authorities suspended Prabhakar and Mongia and the match referee Raman Subba Row docked the team two points for not playing in the spirit of the game. India protested the decision to the ICC, who ruled that the Row had exceeded his authority.\nSubba Row also suspended the West Indies vice-captain Brian Lara for one game, for arguing with the umpire, who he thought should've consulted the third umpire before giving him out stumped.\nNew Zealand did not win any of their four games, though they were unlucky to see the match washed out after dismissing the West Indies cheaply in the opening game."
