        "text": "Johnny Dee (born November 4, 1992) is an American basketball player who last played for MoraBanc Andorra of the LEB Oro. He played college basketball for the San Diego Toreros.\nEarly life.\nJohnny Dee was born on November 4, 1992, in Denver, Colorado, US. Dee's grandfather, Don Dee, played for the Indiana Pacers and was on the U.S. 1968 Olympic gold-medal-winning basketball team. His father, Donnie Dee, played for the Indianapolis Colts in the NFL for two seasons, while his mother, Jackie, was on the cross country team at the University of Tulsa. He has a younger sister Jenny who played basketball at UC Irvine. Johnny Dee was a part of the Rancho Buena Vista Little League All-Star team that advanced to the 2005 Little League World Series, playing shortstop. He attended Rancho Buena Vista High School and led the San Diego Section in scoring as a senior with 32.8 points per game. Portland State was the only Division I school to offer him a scholarship, but Dee decided to walk on at San Diego.\nCollege career.\nWhen Dee arrived at San Diego, the team was coming off a 6–24 season and point-shaving scandal. Dee received a scholarship the summer before his freshman year after a player announced he was leaving the program. He considered redshirting, but coach Bill Grier talked him out of the idea and he averaged 13.7 points per game. Dee increased his scoring to 15.0 points per game as a sophomore. He twisted his left ankle playing against Loyola Marymount but still managed to score 19 points in a win over BYU three nights later. As a junior, Dee played most of the season with a knee injury. During this time, he led NCAA Division I in free throw shooting percentage at 94.5% while averaging 16.6 points per game. In order to calm his nerves at the line, Dee silently recited the Bible verse Philippians 4:13: \"I can do all things through him who gives me strength.\" As a senior, Dee averaged 17.0 points per game and shot 37.9 percent from behind the arc. Dee is San Diego's all-time leading scorer, finishing with 2,046 points, the all-time leader in three-pointers with 333, and was tied for second in games played with 131. He was a two-time All-West Coast Conference First Team selection.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted, Dee signed with the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Summer League. Dee began his professional career with Široki and averaged over 19 points per game. On November 9, 2015, he signed with Polish club Starogard Gdański. He averaged 11 points per game in Poland. In the 2017–2018 season, Dee joined Araberri of the Spanish LEB Oro. He posted 15.9 points per game, which led the league in scoring. He also averaged 2.5 assists per game. On August 6, 2018, he signed a two-year deal with Real Betis in the same league. On July 13, 2019, he signed with Delteco Gipuzkoa Basket in the same league. On February 4, 2020, he won the Copa Princesa de Asturias for the second year in a row, and was also selected as the MVP of the final. During the 2020–21 season, he averaged 10.6 points, 1.9 rebounds, and 1.1 assists per game. Dee signed with Movistar Estudiantes on August 4, 2021.\nAccording to his player profile, he is and weighs ."

        "title": "Doping in tennis",
        "text": " \nThe practice of doping in tennis involves the use of prohibited, performance-enhancing substances listed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). The practice is considered unsportsmanlike and unethical, with punishments for such offences ranging from official warnings to career bans, depending on the severity of the offence.\nWidespread illegal substance abuse in tennis developed during the 1980s and 1990s as performance-enhancing substances became increasingly available in professional sport. The detection and punishment for the use of drugs in this period was aided by the takeover of policing drug cheating by the International Tennis Federation in 1993.\nHistory.\nAnti-doping policy within tennis primarily developed from the 1980s with the increased prevalence of recreational drugs and steroid use among athletes across various sporting professions.\nAccording to the International Tennis Federation (ITF), the Men's Tennis Council began drug testing in the late 1980s. The drug testing program that was administered by the Men's Tennis Council targeted recreational drugs such as cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana, before the creation of the ATP Tour in 1990 marked an official transition towards performance-enhancing drug regulation.\nFrom 1993, the Women's Tennis Association (WTA World Tour), Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) and International Tennis Federation (ITF) led a combined anti-doping initiative in professional tennis.\nFollowing the joint initiative between the ATP and WTA, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) became the sole governing body for professional tennis anti-doping initiatives in 2007, as the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA World Tour) moved towards a player-focused organisation and administrative role. Other bodies that regulate doping within tennis on a national level include the United States Anti-Doping Agency.\nDoping in men's tennis.\nCases on the ATP Tour include:\nAndre Agassi (1997).\nIn 1997, Andre Agassi returned a positive drug test for the use of methamphetamine. A joint investigation carried out by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP World Tour) handed down a three-month suspension from professional tennis for the incident. However, the punishment was not formally handed down after Agassi blamed the positive result on a spiked drink.\nAgassi's case was revisited in 2009 following the publication of Agassi's autobiography, \"Open: An Autobiography\", where Agassi admitted to lying about the cause of his positive drug test result. Agassi admitted that he became addicted to methamphetamine during 1997 after his assistant introduced him to the drug and he faced both personal and professional problems.\nFollowing the admission, no formal case has been opened against Agassi as the offence was committed prior to the establishment of the World-Anti Doping Agency in 1999 and the International Tennis Federation's (ITF) formal takeover of the ATP World Tour's anti-doping program since 2007.\nRichard Gasquet (2009).\nIn 2009, Richard Gasquet returned a positive drug result for cocaine use. Gasquet denied intentional use of the drug, citing that he may have been exposed to the substance after kissing a female at a Miami nightclub (known in the media as \"The Cocaine Kiss Controversy\").\nThe International Tennis Federation (ITF) and the World Anti-Doping Agency were initially seeking a two-year ban because of the substance used in the incident. Due to Gasquet's denial, and the small amount of cocaine detected, Gasquet initially received a one-year ban. However, this was overturned following an independent review that found the case was unintentional. The ITF and WADA challenged the ruling in the Court of Arbitration for Sport but were unsuccessful. \nConsequently, Gasquet received a formal six-week ban that came into effect in May 2009 to July 2009, which prevented him from competing in the French Open or Wimbledon. During this period his professional ranking fell nine places. This was the only punishment enforced by governing authorities, with no prize money fine or forfeiture of ranking being imposed. An independent tribunal ruled that Gasquet had not intentionally consumed the substance, that it was not performance-enhancing, and that he would have consumed the bare minimum amount to be detected.\nIn January 2010, the Court of Arbitration for Sport found Gasquet not guilty of a doping offence and he returned to professional tennis following the ban at the Australian Open in 2010.\nMarin Čilić (2013).\nIn 2013, Marin Čilić returned a positive drug test for the substance nikethamide. The drug is a widely used stimulant that affects respiratory function through the increase in blood flow and oxygen intake within the body.\nČilić denied having deliberately taken the drug, stating that the substance was contained in glucose tablets that were purchased from a pharmacy while he was competing in France. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recognised Cilic's claim and did not hand down the regular two-year professional ban for instances of illegal doping. Instead, he received a nine-month ban due to the low level of the drug that was detected and the contextual circumstances.\nThe initial ban would have prevented Čilić from competing in the 2013 US Open and the 2014 Australian Open with the suspension period extending from May 1, 2013, to January 31, 2014. However, following a successful appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Čilić's nine-month ban was reduced to four months, with a retrospective provisioning period recognising time already spent away from the game. The ruling also resulted in the return of Čilić's prize money and ATP World Tour points from the 2013 French Open, 2013 Wimbledon and 2013 BMW Open where he tested positive to nikethamide.\nCilic returned to the professional tennis circuit on 25 October 2013.\nViktor Troicki (2013).\nIn 2013, Viktor Troicki refused to partake in a mandatory blood test carried out by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). As part of the 2013 anti-doping program administered by the governing body, it is compulsory that when requested by ITF staff, that players provide in and/or out-of-competition blood and urine testing. While it is possible for players to ask to be excused from such test, it is at the discretion of the ITF to postpone such tests.\nTroicki stated he did not agree to the blood test as he was sick when the test was ordered by the ITF, however, he did provide the mandatory urine sample. In conjunction with his illness, Troicki also suffers from a phobia of needles that makes such tests difficult to administer. Having refused Troicki's claim, the ITF handed down an 18-month ban due to the failure to comply with the organisations anti-doping regulations. The initial ban prevented Troicki from competing professionally on the ITF Challenger or ATP World Tour from 26 July 2013 until 24 January 2015, missing the 2013 US Open, all the 2014 Grand Slams and 2015 Australian Open. The punishment also enforced the forfeiture of all ATP World Tour points and prize money received at the 2013 Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament where he refused to participate in the blood test.\nTroicki appealed the sentence to the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2013 and was successful in having his ban reduced by 6 months from 18 to a total 12-month ban. The new sentence prevented Troicki from competing professionally from 26 July 2013 to 26 July 2014 with the sentence recognising time already spent suspended from the game.\nTroicki returned to professional tennis in July 2014 at a world ranking of 847 that prevented him from returning to the ATP World Tour. He returned to tournaments on the International Tennis Federation's Challenger circuit.\nDoping in women's tennis.\nExamples in WTA Tour include:\nMartina Hingis (2007).\nIn 2007, Martina Hingis tested positive to the drug benzoylecgonine, a substance that has traces to cocaine. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) gave Hingis a two-year suspension from professional tennis that began on 1 October 2007 in conjunction with a forfeiture of her world ranking and a fine exceeding $120,000. Hingis challenged the ruling, however, this was refused by the ITF as she had already announced a retirement from the sport.\nHingis maintained her innocence stating she had never used cocaine and subsequently carried out a private drug test which returned a negative result. Despite the disparity in results, Hingis retired from professional tennis for the second time and did not formally challenge the ruling.\nHingis later returned to tennis in 2013, and attained the world number one ranking on the WTA women's doubles circuit.\nBarbora Záhlavová-Strýcová (2013).\nIn 2013, Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová tested positive to the banned stimulant, sibutramine while competing at the 2013 Luxembourg Open. The drug is primarily used for weight loss with its effects on human metabolic function. The substance is widely prescribed to sufferers of obesity and diabetes with the main effect of the drug being an appetite suppressant. The drug was added to the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substance list in 2012.\nZáhlavová-Strýcová stated she did not deliberately ingest the drug to lose weight or cheat in competition, but did admit to using a weight-loss supplement Acai Berry Thin which has the substance as one of the ingredients. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) recognised that Zhalavova Strýcová did not intentionally take the drug for the benefit of her professional game and thus did not hand down the maximum two-year ban for illegal doping, however, she did receive a six-month ban from professional tennis. In conjunction with the suspension of play, Zhalavova Strýcová was also forced to forfeit all WTA Tour points and prize money from the 2012 Luxembourg Open and 2012 Buschl Open when the substance was in her body. The ban prevented Záhlavová-Strýcová competing from 16 October 2012 until 16 April 2013, ruling her out of the 2013 Australian Open.\nMaria Sharapova (2016).\nIn 2016, Maria Sharapova confessed to failing a WADA drug test while playing at the Australian Open in 2016. The substance used was a drug named meldonium that is used to treat heart disease with its effects on blood circulation through the transfer of fatty acids into the human body. Sharapova maintained there was no wrongdoing on her behalf, having admitted to using the prescription based drug for over ten years due to her susceptibility to influenza, treatment for symptoms of diabetes and magnesium deficiency.\nOn 1 January 2016, the drug was placed on the International Tennis Federation's banned substance list as it was ruled to have performance-enhancing effects. Such effects include increased blood circulation through the greater intake of oxygen that enables increased exercise ability and a reduced recovery period.\nA report handed down by the International Tennis Federation and World Anti-Doping Agency found that while Sharapova may not have been consciously using the substance to increase performance, it is the responsibility of the player and team to be aware of new additions to the banned substance list. As a result, Sharapova was initially issued a two-year ban by the ITF that prevented her from competing professionally on the WTA World Tour until 25 January 2018.\nFollowing an investigation by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in October 2016, Sharapova's ban was reduced from two years to 15 months after it was found there was no intention to cheat and no significant fault on her behalf. The ruling enabled Sharapova to return to competitive tennis on April 26, 2017.\nDuring her ban Sharapova published her memoir, \"Unstoppable: My Life So Far\", that was published in June 2018.\nSharapova returned to grand slam tennis at the 2018 US Open through a wildcard entry. She made it to the fourth round before losing to Anastasija Sevastova.\nSimona Halep (2022).\nSimona Halep is a Romanian tennis player who has won two Grand Slam titles and reached the world number one ranking in 2017. She was suspended from playing tennis after testing positive for a banned substance. In October 2022, she was notified by then nascent International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) that she tested positive for Roxadustat, an anti-anaemia drug that stimulates the production of red blood cells, at the US Open in September. She is provisionally suspended pending a hearing where she hoped to prove her innocence. She says she has evidence that she was contaminated by a supplement that contained Roxadustat.\nThe subsequent year in May she was charged with a second doping offence by the ITIA over “irregularities” in her biological passport (ABP), which monitors blood indicators over time. Following this, Halep accused the ITIA of requesting a third delay to her hearing and violating her rights to a quick and fair process. Halep says she is “devastated” and “spiraling” over her doping case and claims the ITIA is “killing” her reputation.\nOn 12 September 2023, the ITIA suspended Halep for a period of four years, backdated to her initial suspension on 6 October 2022. Halep would appeal the ban to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS). On 5 March 2024, CAS reduced Halep’s sentence to nine months, which she had already served.\nHalep was cleared for immediate return from suspension and would return to tennis at the 2024 Miami Open.\nList of banned substances.\nThe list of banned substances in tennis as it stands in 2018 has been published by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The prohibited substance list is categorised into the following:\nList of banned doping methods.\nIn addition to the publication of an official list of banned substances, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has published a list of banned practices that are considered acts of illegal doping within tennis.\nWhile it is not recognised as a doping method, the un/intentional avoidance or missed drug test carried out by the ITF or other anti-doping body is also recognised as a type of doping offence. While the player may not have banned substances within their system, a missed test can result in a ban from professional competition of up to two years.\nControversies surrounding anti-doping policy.\nAnti-doping policy remains controversial due to the large amount of substances, ingredients and chemicals that athletes are prohibited from being exposed to.\nControversy surrounds inadvertent cases of doping, such as those by Richard Gasquet (The Cocaine Kiss Controversy) and Maria Sharapova (long used drug added to the prohibited list without knowledge). While in both cases these players were ruled not to be at fault, the strict measures led to legal battle and damage to players reputation.\nAnother controversy surrounding doping policy is the strict times at which testing can be carried out that players must hold themselves to or face potential repercussions, as seen with Viktor Troicki in 2013."

        "text": "The MFL Challenge Cup (Malay: \"Piala Cabaran MFL\"), formerly known as the Malaysia Challenge Cup, is a Malaysian football competition held under the auspices of the Malaysian Football League and the Football Association of Malaysia.\nHistory.\nThe tournament was created for the Malaysia Super League and the Malaysia Premier League teams that did not qualify for the Malaysia Cup tournament through their league standings. The idea was mooted by the Football Malaysia in December 2017 as a solution to increase the number of competitive games. Observers such as FourFourTwo Malaysia see benefits of the Challenge Cup; as another chance of silverware for the competitors, maintaining the competitive edge between the participating teams, and as a way to analyze players in their teams in preparation for the next season.\nThe inaugural tournament was held in 2018, with eight teams divided into 2 groups of four and playing a double round-robin system of games. The winners and runners-up of each group qualify to the knockout round on a home and away basis including the final. The tournament is held concurrently with the Malaysia Cup, with Challenge Cup games mostly played in midweek (Tuesday, Wednesday) as opposed to Malaysia Cup games played on weekends (Friday, Saturday and Sunday).\nSelection of teams.\nFor the 2018 edition, the team that finished last in the Malaysia Super League, and the sixth-placed to twelfth-placed teams in the Malaysia Premier League qualified for the tournament. The selection of teams remained the same for 2019.\nFrom 2020 until 2023, it was not held, mostly due to COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions. FAM announced the competition will return in 2023, featuring 8 teams who are eliminated in the last 16 of the 2023 Malaysia Cup."

Water polo activities are sponsored by Bank of Valletta.\nHistory.\nWater polo was played in Malta at the turn of the 20th century, and was already a well-contested sport in the 1920s, when Lord Plumer, then Governor of Malta, thought about the possibility of entering a Maltese team in the 1924 Summer Olympics. Eventually Lord Plumer left his post but the Maltese enterprised through the Aquatic Sports Association of Malta, then called Amateur Swimmers Association. This was refused by the Dutch organising them on the grounds that Malta was not a country, and after a legal battle ensued for Malta to be able to accede, Malta entered the 1928 Summer Olympics. It is worth noting that this process also led to the creation of the Malta Olympic Committee.\nClubs.\nPreviously there were much more teams, and there was even a league system specific to Gozo only. Currently the clubs are:\nDomestic League.\nThe Maltese Water polo league currently features 12 teams in two divisions:\nNational Team.\nMalta has qualified for the 2016 Men's European Water Polo Championship and the 2018 Men's European Water Polo Championship."

The series' transition to polygonal graphics was generally approved of, particularly since the game still runs as fast as its predecessors, though multiple reviewers criticized that the bats are grossly out-of-proportion, saying they look like two-by-four lumber planks. Most also commented on the inability to trade players. However, the batting/pitching quadrant system was highly praised. \"Next Generation\", in particular, argued that in conjunction with the deep fielding controls and management strategies, the quadrant system makes \"World Series Baseball '98\" a genre-redefining game comparable to the likes of \"Doom\" and \"NFL GameDay 97\". The reviewer stated, \"Clearly, this is the new standard for baseball games, and there are no current games that even come close. Saturn may not have much, but it's got baseball.\" Other critics were more moderate, though still positive. \"GamePro\" concluded that the fast, fun nature of the game overrides its issues with graphics and sounds, and compared it favorably to contemporary baseball games on the Saturn such as \"Grand Slam\". Kraig Kujawa and Dean Hager both said that it is inferior to \"MLB '98\", but still very good, and Hager added, \"I'll say for sure it's the best baseball game for the Saturn.\"\nThe Genesis version was released at the end of the console's lifespan and was largely ignored by the press. A brief review in \"GamePro\" criticized that the only improvements over \"World Series Baseball '96\" are updated rosters and interleague play, making it only worth buying for those who do not yet have a baseball game for the Genesis.\nDuring the inaugural Interactive Achievement Awards, the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences nominated the Saturn version for \"Console Sports Game of the Year\", which was ultimately awarded to \"International Superstar Soccer 64\"."

However, the protest was rejected by the Asian Games' Jury of Appeals.\nIn the event, after Adekoya tested positive for stanozolol in January 2019, the Athletics Integrity Unit ordered that her results from 24 August 2018 be deleted from the records, thus disqualifying the Bahrainian team."

        "title": "2019 PBA Tour season",
        "text": "The 2019 PBA Tour season, the 60th season of play for the U.S. Professional Bowlers Association's ten-pin bowling tour, began in January 2019 with the PBA Hall of Fame Classic in Arlington, Texas. The season schedule had 27 singles title events, two doubles title events, and two non-title team events.\nThe 2019 season introduced major changes, with Fox Sports assuming the media and sponsorship rights to the PBA Tour, as well as the introduction of a revamped PBA Tour Playoffs as a 24-player, bracketed elimination tournament. Another big change came later in the year, when the PBA was purchased by Bowlero Corporation.\nMedia rights.\nOn March 21, 2018, Fox Sports announced that it had acquired the television rights for the PBA Tour, replacing ESPN, with a commitment for 26 broadcasts on Fox Sports 1 and four on the Fox broadcast network beginning in 2019 (totalling 58 hours, in comparison to the 30 hours of coverage provided by ESPN linear channels in 2018). To launch its coverage, Fox broadcast an invitational event, the PBA Clash, on December 23, 2018. Fox will air four events per-season, including the CP3 PBA Celebrity Invitational (which aired on the afternoon of Super Bowl LIII). Fox and FS1 have aired 14 final rounds live during the 2019 season, as compared to the four live broadcasts aired on ESPN in 2018. Fox Sports also assumed the role of sponsorship sales for the tour. The PBA saw the deal as an effort to increase media exposure for the tour and its top players.\nIn a similar manner to Fox's 2016 acquisition of NHRA drag racing, Fox focused on developing new on-air features and technology to improve viewer understanding of the intricacies of the sport, and additional shoulder content. One such feature is StrikeTrack, a graphic (based on technology from the company Kegel) that displays the trajectory, speed, and rotation (RPM) of the ball as it travels down the lane. \"Broadcasting &amp; Cable\" considered this feature akin to the infamous \"FoxTrax\" used during Fox's National Hockey League coverage in the 1990s.\nOn August 15, the PBA and Fox announced the return of the PBA Clash, the fifth 2019 event to air on Fox television. The November 3 broadcast (tape-delayed from October 21) will feature the top eight 2019 money leaders through September 21 vying for a $50,000 top prize.\nThe PBA reported ratings growth in the first year of its contract; the Tournament of Champions finals broadcast on Fox was its highest-rated first-run telecast of the season, at 1,132,000 viewers. Including first-run and rerun broadcasts, the association reported that total viewership of all PBA telecasts on Fox networks through the PBA Tour Playoffs had seen an 85% increase in viewership over 2018, with the ten playoffs broadcasts being seen by at least 7.941 million.\nTournament schedule.\nOn August 28, 2018, the PBA announced that all events televised on Fox and FS1, except for the USBC Masters, will only be open to members of the association. The USBC Masters has traditionally allowed qualifying USBC members who may not be PBA members to participate, and will continue to do so. PBA Xtra Frame Tour, PBA Regional Tour and PBA50 Tour events will also continue to allow qualifying non-members to participate.\nThe 2019 PBA Tournament of Champions and PBA Players Championship majors were held in February. In order to include it in Fox's new contract, the PBA's World Series of Bowling X (which included three standard PBA title events and the PBA World Championship — the season's third major) was postponed for 2018 and moved to March 2019, with live finals broadcasts occurring in prime time across four consecutive nights. For the first three majors of 2019 and the PBA Indianapolis Open, Fox and the PBA offered a $1 million bonus for any player who rolls a 300 game in the televised title match. Of the PBA's 26 televised 300 games, only two came in the title match, and neither of these was in a major tournament.\nThe season's fourth major, the USBC Masters, took place March 26–April 1 in Las Vegas. The U.S. Open, the season's final major, was contested October 23–30 in Mooresville, North Carolina.\nA new PBA Playoffs event featured the top 24 players in points after the first 13 events of the 2019 season (through the USBC Masters), and offered a $100,000 top prize. The single-elimination tournament was set up in a split format, with the elimination rounds held April 8–10 and the final four competing in two live broadcasts on June 1 and 2.\nThe PBA League team event, which has been held since the 2012–13 season, continued into 2019. For the first time, all rounds of this tournament aired in live broadcasts, between July 16 and July 18.\nAs in the previous two seasons, CBS Sports Network carried the PBA Tour Finals, which took place July 20 and 21 in Las Vegas. (PBA Commissioner Tom Clark later announced an agreement with CBS Sports Network to cover the PBA Tour finals through the 2022 PBA season.) The tournament retained a similar format as in 2018, with eight top players seeded into two groups of four. The main difference for 2019 is that the eight players were determined based on Tour points ranking since the beginning of the 2018 season. (In previous PBA Tour Finals, the eight bowlers were chosen and seeded based on Tour earnings, not points.) CBS Sports Network broadcast an unprecedented nine hours of live coverage over the two days.\nThe PBA Xtra Frame summer tour returned with some additional incentives. Renamed the USBC Cup tour, this consisted of nine title events in seven cities, beginning with the PBA Lubbock Sports Shootout in late June and concluding with the three-event PBA Summer Swing on August 24–31. All events aired live on the FloBowling Xtra Frame webcast service. The top five PBA members in points over these nine events shared in a $40,000 bonus pool, with the top points earner (Sean Rash) winning a $20,000 bonus and the honor of USBC Cup champion. In addition, the top eight PBA members over these events earned berths in the FloBowling PBA ATX Summer Tour Finals on September 21 and the PBA China Tiger Cup on November 19–21. In the China Tiger Cup, the eight players will join eight Chinese PBA members in singles and team matches at the first PBA event to ever be held in China.\n2019 Highlights.\nPlayer awards.\nPlayer awards for the 2019 season were announced on December 11, 2019.\nTournament summary.\nThe 2019 PBA tournament schedule is shown below. Major tournaments are in bold. Career PBA title numbers for winners are shown in parentheses (#). Prize money is shown in US dollars.\nTour points are awarded for most events. Besides the season-ending Harry Smith PBA Points Winner award, points are one consideration for Player of the Year voting, and also affect eligibility for the PBA Playoffs, PBA Tour Finals (combined with 2018 points), PBA China Tiger Cup (USBC Cup event points only) and the 2020 DHC PBA Japan Invitational. Points for tournaments are awarded differently based on a \"tier\" system. The tier of each qualifying tournament is shown in the Notes column on the tournament schedule, and is explained below."

Finals were held to determine the placing of each boat; these finals were given letters with those nearer to the beginning of the alphabet meaning a better ranking. Semifinals were named based on which finals they fed, with each semifinal having two possible finals.\nWith 18 boats in with heats, the best boats qualify directly for the semi-finals. All other boats progress to the repechage round, which offers a second chance to qualify for the semi-finals. The best three boats in each of the repechage qualify for the semi-finals.

        "title": "Trey Lewis (basketball)",
        "text": "Joseph \"Trey\" Lewis III (born October 18, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for Mornar of the ABA League and the Montenegrin League. He played college basketball for Penn State, Cleveland State, and Louisville.\nEarly life.\nLewis was a successful basketball player while at Garfield Heights in his hometown of Garfield Heights, Ohio, leading the team to three conference titles in his four years there. As a senior, he averaged 23 points, 5.1 assists and 4.8 rebounds per game, leading the team to a 24–2 record, the best in school history. Garfield Heights went to the state semifinals his senior year, losing to Trey Burke and Northland High School. Lewis received several awards in his senior year, being named co-player of the year in Division I with Burke. He was recruited to Penn State by assistant coach Lewis Preston.\nCollege career.\nBy the time Lewis arrived at Penn State, head coach Ed DeChellis departed for Navy and was replaced by Pat Chambers. In his first game, a win over Youngstown State, Lewis led PSU with 35 points. Lewis started six games and averaged 5.6 points and 1.4 rebounds per game while the Nittany Lions finished with a 12–20 record. After the season Lewis, who missed a dozen games due to a back injury, transferred to Cleveland State. \"I wouldn't trade my one year at Penn State for anything,\" Lewis said. \"But it's tough when you're not the guy the coach recruited.\"\nDue to NCAA regulations, Lewis was forced to sit out a year as a redshirt, which he used to rehabilitate his back. As a sophomore, Lewis averaged 13.1 points per game, second on the team to Bryn Forbes, and led the team to a 21–12 record. As a junior, in the fifth game of the season, Lewis finished with 24 points in a 45–33 loss to Louisville. He led the league with 96 three-pointers, a school single-season record, shooting 42.3 percent from behind the arc. Lewis finished with 16.3 points, 4.4 rebounds and 2.9 assists per game on the season and twice scored more than 30 points. Lewis was named to the First-team All-Horizon League. After the season he decided to transfer to Louisville, selecting the Cardinals over offers from Ohio State and Xavier, and was not required to sit out a season since he graduated from Cleveland State. \"What it came down to was the need and the want from Louisville was the perfect situation for me and what I'm looking for going into this last year,\" Lewis said.\nIn Lewis's final season he sought to reach the NCAA Tournament, in which the Cardinals regularly participated. However, since Louisville was involved in a scandal over their recruitment efforts, the college itself declared the team ineligible for a postseason attendance very early in the season, much to the dismay of Lewis. Along with fellow graduate transfer Damion Lee, Lewis cried after hearing the news. He averaged 11.3 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 2.3 assists per game in his final collegiate season. He had a season-high 22 points and five assists against Virginia Tech. Lewis made 27 starts and helped Louisville finish the season 23–8.\nProfessional career.\nIn the 2016 NBA draft, Lewis was not selected by any team in the NBA, but in the 2016 NBA Summer League, he played for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Lewis decided to start his professional career in Europe and signed in a contract with the German first division club medi Bayreuth on July 23, 2016. In his rookie season, he posted 15.3 points, 2.6 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game, shooting 44.7% on three-pointers. Lewis was named among the ten best players of the season in the \"BBL All-Second Team\".\nFor the following season in 2017–18, Lewis moved to German league rivals Ratiopharm Ulm, signing a deal in July 2017. In January 2018 Lewis was once again a participant in the BBL All-Star Game. He averaged 11.6 points, 2.1 assists and 1.8 rebounds per game and also appearing in 10 EuroCup matches. On February 25, 2018, he signed with JL Bourg Basket of the French first division. Lewis posted 17.2 points, 3.9 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game in France.\nIn the 2018 NBA Summer League, Lewis played for the Utah Jazz, where he was teammates with former Louisville teammate Donovan Mitchell. Lewis averaged 9.0 points, 3.0 rebounds and 2.3 assists per game in four games. On August 28, 2018, he signed with the Jazz. Lewis was waived by the Jazz on October 3, 2018. He then joined the Jazz's NBA G League affiliate, the Salt Lake City Stars.\nOn July 27, 2019, he signed with BCM Gravelines-Dunkerque of the LNB Pro A. Lewis parted ways with the team on January 28, 2020, after averaging 14 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game. On October 28, he signed with Maccabi Rishon LeZion of the Israeli Premier League. Lewis averaged 14.3 points and 1.9 assists per game in the Winner League. On July 24, 2021, he signed with Mornar of the ABA League and the Montenegrin League."

        "text": "The 2018 National Rugby Championship was the fifth season of the top flight of Australian domestic rugby union. The competition began on 1 September and concluded on 27 October. Matches were broadcast on Fox Sports and the championship featured eight professional teams, seven from Australia and one from Fiji.\nThe Fijian Drua won their first NRC title, defeating reigning champion side by 36–26 in the grand final held at Churchill Park in Lautoka. The Drua secured home ground advantage in the final by winning the minor premiership for the regular season and then beating in their semifinal. Queensland Country defeated the Western Force in the other semifinal to progress to the grand final. Fijian Drua also finished the season as winners of the Horan-Little Shield for 2018.\nTeams.\nThere were two major changes for the 2018 season. The Greater Sydney Rams team was removed from the competition, leaving New South Wales with two participating sides in the NRC, one Sydney team and one Country team. In Perth, the Western Force replaced Perth Spirit as the team in Western Australia, following the removal of the Force from the Super Rugby competition in 2018. The eight teams for the 2018 NRC season include two from New South Wales, two from Queensland, and one each from Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Western Australia, and Fiji:\nTelevision coverage and streaming.\nTwo of the NRC matches each weekend are broadcast live via Fox Sports, with the remaining matches shown live on the Fox Sports streaming platform. Discussion of the NRC competition is included on the Fox Sports review show NRC Extra Time on Monday nights, and the Kick &amp; Chase program on Wednesday evenings.\nExperimental Law Variations.\nWorld Rugby adopted all global law variations being trialled as of May 2018 into the rugby law book with immediate effect. As such, the NRC 2017 trial changes to Laws 15, 16 and 20 (renumbered as 14, 15 and 19 in the simplified 2018 laws) were officially incorporated by World Rugby and thus became variations no more. The other law variations used for the NRC in 2017 were retained for the 2018 season.\nRegular season.\nThe eight teams competed in a round-robin tournament for the regular season. During this section of the competition, teams also played for the Horan-Little Shield, a challenge trophy put on the line when a challenge is accepted by the holders or mandated by the terms of competition for the shield.\nPoints for the regular season standings were accumulated by the same method as for The Rugby Championship and Super Rugby. A slightly modified version of the standard competition points system was used, with a bonus point awarded to a winning team scoring at least 3 tries more than their opponent; and a bonus point awarded to a losing team defeated by a margin of 7 points or under. Four points were awarded for a win and none for a loss; two points were awarded to each team if a match was drawn.\nEach team's placement was based on its cumulative points total, including any bonus points earned. For teams level on table points, tiebreakers apply in the following order:\nThe top four teams at the end of the regular season qualified for the title play-offs in the form of semi-finals followed by a final to determine the champion team.\nCompetition rounds.\nAll times are local (and subject to change).\n2018 Emerging States Championship.\nFrom 2018 an additional competition was formed for teams from so-called \"Emerging States\", featuring the Adelaide Black Falcons, Victoria Country Barbarians, Northern Territory Mosquitoes and Tasmania Jack Jumpers. The first Competition was held in Adelaide in September 2018, and the Black Falcons were the inaugural winners."

The men's tournament was introduced as a demonstration sport at the 1920 Summer Olympics, and made a permanent sport when the Winter Olympics began in 1924. The Polish national team has participated in thirteen tournaments, first in 1928 and most recently in 1992. A total of 18 goaltenders and 136 skaters have represented Poland at the Olympics.\nPoland has never finished higher than fourth at the Olympics, which they achieved at the 1932 Winter Olympics, when only four teams participated. Their lowest finish was eleventh, of twelve teams, in 1992. Since 1992, Poland has not participated in the Olympics, though the team has played in Olympic qualifying tournaments.\nThe Olympic Games were originally intended for amateur athletes, so the players of the National Hockey League (NHL) and other professional leagues were not allowed to compete. The countries that benefited most were the Soviet Bloc countries of Eastern Europe, where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. In 1986, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to allow all athletes to compete in Olympic Games, starting in 1988.\nHilary Skarżyński has scored the most goals, with nine, while Andrzej Fonfara and Andrzej Zabawa have had the most assists, with seven each. Zabawa and Wiesław Jobczyk have each recorded fourteen points, the most of any Polish player. Henryk Gruth and Jerzy Potz have competed in the most Olympics, having taken part in four tournaments, while Gruth has played the most games of any skater, with twenty-four. Władysław Pabisz has won the most games for Poland, with five, while Gabriel Samolej and Józef Stogowski have each played in ten games, the most of any goaltender. Gruth is the only Polish player to be inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation Hall of Fame."

        "text": "American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) is one of the governing bodies of college rowing in the United States, together with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA).\nHistory.\nEstablished in 2008 by Gregg Hartsuff under the General Not for Profit Association Act of 1986, the American Collegiate Rowing Association (ACRA) is made up of club-level collegiate rowing teams. \nBefore 2006, competitive club rowing programs, which receive little or no funding from their university athletic departments, were able to compete at the IRA Championship. In 2006, Rutgers University cut funding from its men's rowing program, reducing it to \"club\" status. Part of Rutger's justification for cutting rowing was that clubs could compete equally with funded programs at the IRA Championships. To avoid other members from losing funding, the IRA excluded clubs from competing at its championship beginning in 2007. ACRA became an alternative championship for these clubs.\nThe ACRA National Championship Regatta is considered the National Championship for collegiate club programs and all programs outside the NCAA/IRA structure.\nThe regatta is split into six regions: the Mid-Atlantic region, the Great Lakes region, the Plains region, the Northeast region, the South region, and the West Coast region. The ACRA is a broadcast partner of The Rowers Consortium of Huntington Harbour, California, who has broadcast the regatta on The Rowing Channel since 2014."

        "text": "The 2018 Sibiu Cycling Tour is a cycling stage race that took place between 5 and 8 July 2018 in and around Sibiu, Romania. Raced over , the race featured a traditional cobbled prologue along with mountain stages to Bâlea Lake and Păltiniș, and was held as part of the 2018 UCI Europe Tour.\nIn 2018 the race returned to the format last used in 2014 with four days of racing including two mountain top finishes. There were two stages on the final day including the return of the team time trial.\nTeams.\nThe peloton featured three Professional Continental Teams, 14 Continental Teams and two national teams.\nRoute.\nThe race route was announced in December 2017.\nStages.\nPrologue.\nRaced over a technical with 20 corners and several cobbled sections, the stage was won by Italian Davide Ballerini who would be the only rider to finish in under 3 minutes.\nStage 1.\nFor the second year in a row, there was a Colombian victory on the slopes of Balea Lac. With five kilometres remaining in the stage Iván Sosa attacked a depleted peloton of 15-20 riders. Initially, two riders, Maxim Rusnac and Amaro Antunes remained with him, but with a second attack he shook off the other contenders and rode to a solo victory.\nStage 2.\nStage 2 was expected to be a mountain stage to the resort of Paltanis. Despite setting off in bright conditions, after the race was engulfed by a storm that saw rain, hail, thunder and lightning, with visibility at less than 20 metres and with police unable to maintain road closures. In coordination with the race organisers, the jury decided to apply the UCI Extreme Weather Protocol, declaring the stage null and void in accordance with article 2.2.029 of the UCI rulebook.\nClassification leadership table.\nIn the 2018 Sibiu Cycling Tour, six different jerseys are awarded of which four are worn in the race. The most important is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses are awarded to the first three finishers on all stages with the exception of the time trial: the stage winner won a ten-second bonus, with six and four seconds for the second and third riders respectively. Bonus seconds were also awarded to the first three riders at intermediate sprints; three seconds for the winner of the sprint, two seconds for the rider in second and one second for the rider in third. The rider with the least accumulated time is the race leader, identified by a yellow jersey. This classification is considered the most important of the 2017 Sibiu Cycling Tour, and the winner of the classification is considered the winner of the race.\nThere is also a mountains classification, the leadership of which is marked by a white jersey. In the mountains classification, points towards the classification are won by reaching the top of a climb before other cyclists. Each climb is categorised as either category SA, A, B or C, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs.\nThe third jersey represents the young rider classification, marked by an orange jersey. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born on or after 1 January 1995 are eligible to be ranked in the classification.\nThe fourth classification is the sprints classification, the leader of which is awarded a blue jersey. In the sprints classification, riders receive points for finishing in the top three at intermediate sprint points during each stage – awarded on a 3–2–1 scale – and these intermediate sprints also offer bonus seconds towards the general classification as noted above.\nAdditionally, there is a points classification, which awards a green jersey but that jersey is not represented in the race and only present on the podium. In the points classification, cyclists receive points for finishing in the top 15 in a stage, and unlike in the points classification in the Tour de France, the winners of all stages (with the exception of the prologue) are awarded the same number of points. For winning a stage, a rider earns 25 points, with 20 for second, 16 for third, 14 for fourth, 12 for fifth, 10 for sixth with a point fewer per place down to a single point for 15th place.\nThe sixth and final jersey represents the classification for Romanian riders, marked by a red jersey. This is decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders born in Romania are eligible to be ranked in the classification. Like the points jersey this is only present on the podium and is not worn in race\nThere are also awards for the team classification, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage are added together; the leading team at the end of the race is the team with the lowest total time."

This was Croatia's first Olympic tennis gold and silver medals. For the first time since 1908, the gold medal match was contested by pairs representing the same country. In the bronze medal match, New Zealand's Marcus Daniell and Michael Venus defeated the United States' Austin Krajicek and Tennys Sandgren, 7–6(7–3), 6–2. It was New Zealand's first Olympic tennis medal.\nSpain's Marc López and Rafael Nadal were the reigning gold medalists from 2016, but they chose not to participate.\nThis was the 16th (medal) appearance of the men's doubles tennis event. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics where tennis has been on the program: from 1896 to 1924 and then from 1988 to the current program. A demonstration event was held in 1968.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were best-of-3 sets, except that the third set was a match tiebreak (first to 10 points) instead of a typical set. A tiebreak was played if one of the first two sets reached 6–6.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to two pairs (four players). The total number of male players, in both singles and doubles, for each nation may not exceed six. There are 32 pairs places (64 players) in the event. Qualification is based primarily on the ranking lists of 7 June 2021.\nUp to 10 pairs are selected through individual doubles ranking. The top 10 players in the doubles ranking qualify and may bring any partner with a ranking in the top 300 in either singles or doubles.\nThe draw is then filled to 24 pairs (that is, at least 14 additional pairs and possibly more depending on how the top 10 use their spots) through combined ranking. The better of a player's singles or doubles ranking is used, and the two rankings of a pair of players are added to give a combined ranking, with the lowest rankings earning qualifying spots.\nIf the quota of 86 total male players in singles and doubles has not been reached, the combined ranking continues until either the 86 total quota places are filled or the 32 pair maximum is reached.\nOnce the 86 player quota is met, priority is given to pairs with both members playing in singles (with combined ranking used to select within that group). In the unlikely event that this does not finish filling the 32 pairs, additional spots will be qualified with priority given to pairs with one member playing in singles; finally, if the 32 pair spots still are not filled, the combined ranking of pairs without any singles players is used.\nSchedule.\nThe competition was held over seven days from 24 July to 30 July. Times given are the start of tennis sessions, though the men's doubles shares courts with other tennis events.\nSeeds.\n / (champions, gold medalists)\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(quarterfinals)\"\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(first round)\"\n / \"(second round)\"\n / \"(second round, withdrew due to a positive test for COVID-19)\""

It was Switzerland's first victory in the women's singles. In the bronze medal match, Ukraine's Elina Svitolina defeated Kazakhstan's Elena Rybakina, 1–6, 7–6(7–5), 6–4. It was Ukraine's first Olympic tennis medal.\nThe tournament was held at the Ariake Coliseum in Kōtō, Tokyo, Japan from 24 July to 31 July 2021. There were 64 competitors from 35 countries.\nPuerto Rico's Monica Puig was the reigning gold medalist from 2016, but she withdrew in order to recover from shoulder surgery. The 2016 silver medalist, Germany's Angelique Kerber, also withdrew prior to the tournament for rest. The Czech Republic's Petra Kvitová was the defending bronze medalist and attended her third consecutive Olympic Games, but was defeated in the second round by Belgium's Alison Van Uytvanck.\nThe medals for the competition were presented by Camilo Perez, IOC Member; Paraguay; and the medalists' bouquets were presented by Kelly Fairweather, ITF Secretary General; South Africa.\nBackground.\nThis was the 14th appearance of the women's singles tennis. A women's event was held only once during the first three Games (only men's tennis was played in 1896 and 1904), but has been held at every Olympics for which there was a tennis tournament since 1908. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 and 1984.\nThis was the first Olympic tournament since 1996 not to feature the Williams sisters in the draw after Serena withdrew for family commitments and Venus's ranking had not been high enough to qualify for the team. Of the top players in the annual race to the year-end WTA Finals, the top nine appeared at the tournament, with 15 of the top 20 ranked players overall attending the Olympics. Among the top players to withdraw prior to the Games were Sofia Kenin, Serena Williams, Bianca Andreescu, Simona Halep, Victoria Azarenka, and Coco Gauff.\nThis was the final career singles tournament of former world No. 4 and French Open semifinalist Kiki Bertens, who had announced her retirement from the sport at the conclusion of this tournament. She lost to Vondroušová in the first round; her final career match was in the second round of the doubles tournament, where she and Demi Schuurs lost to Veronika Kudermetova and Elena Vesnina.\nEgypt saw a player qualify in women's singles for the first time in Mayar Sherif. France made its 13th appearance, most among nations, having missed only the 1908 Games in London, when only British players competed.\nQualification.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) can enter up to four players. Nations had been limited to four players in the event since the 2000 Games. Qualification for the women's singles is primarily through the WTA ranking list of 14 June 2021. An additional restriction is that players had to have been part of a nominated team for three Billie Jean King Cup events between 2017 and 2020 (with some exceptions). There are 64 quota places available for women's singles.\nThe first 56 are assigned through the world ranking.\nThere are six places available through continental qualification: four through continental tournaments (two in the 2019 Pan American Games, one in the 2018 Asian Games, and one in the 2019 African Games) and two through continent-restricted world ranking (one each for Europe and Oceania, which must come from NOCs with no other qualified competitors). The four continental tournament places take precedence over the world ranking, so the winners (Nadia Podoroska, Verónica Cepede Royg, Mayar Sherif, and Wang Qiang) are not counted toward the 56 (but are counted toward the four-per-nation limit). One place was guaranteed to the host nation Japan.\nIn an unusual career accomplishment qualification process, one spot is reserved for a former Olympic or Grand Slam champion that has not qualified through the current world rankings. The player must have won an Olympic gold medal or a Grand Slam singles final, be within the top 300 ranked players, and be from a nation that has not already qualified four players. If multiple players meet those criteria, the one with the most titles qualifies; if still tied, the highest ranked player qualifies. If no players meet those criteria, an additional place (57th or 58th) is added to the ranking. For the 2020 tournament, the 'career wild card' quota was taken by 2011 US Open singles champion Samantha Stosur (Venus Williams was not eligible due to the United States already having four players and defending champion Monica Puig was expecting to be in the entry list but withdrew due to injury).\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze medal match. Matches were best-of-3 sets. A tiebreak is played in all sets reaching 6–6, including the last set of a match.\nSchedule.\nThe competition is held over eight days from 24 July to 31 July.

        "text": "David Cochran Miller (born December 9, 1973) is an American college baseball coach and former first baseman, who is the current head baseball coach of the Manhattan Jaspers. He then served as the head coach of the La Salle Explorers (2018–2021) and the Penn State Abington Nittany Lions (2022).\nAmateur career.\nMiller attended Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Miller played for the school's varsity baseball team all four years and played basketball as well. Miller then enrolled at Clemson University, to play college baseball for the Clemson Tigers baseball team.\nAs a freshman at Clemson University in 1993, Miller had a .271 batting average, a .303 on-base percentage (OBP) and a .329 SLG. After the 1993 season, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League.\nAs a sophomore in 1994, Miller batted .313 with a .396 SLG, 1 home run, and 59 RBIs.\nIn the 1995 season as a junior, Miller hit 9 home runs, 14 doubles, 10 triples and 78 RBIs. He was named First Team All-Atlantic Coast Conference, Second Team Coaches All-American, Third Team All-American by \"Baseball America\" and Third Team All-American by \"Collegiate Baseball Newspaper\".\nProfessional career.\nMiller was considered to be one of the best available players in the 1995 Major League Baseball draft and was drafted 23rd overall by the Cleveland Indians.\nMiller began his professional career with the Kinston Indians of the Class A-Advanced Carolina League, where he batted .254 with seven home runs. He was promoted to the Akron Aeros of the Double-A Eastern League in 1997. He hit .301 with four home runs for Akron. Miller started 1998 with the Buffalo Bisons of the Class AAA International League. He completed the season batting .267 with 9 home runs and 54 RBIs in 115 games. With Miller not being added to the Indians' 40 man roster, Miller was selected by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 1998 Rule 5 draft. Miller failed to make the Phillies 40 man and was returned to the Indians. He played a second season at Buffalo in 1999, hitting .240 with 2 home runs and 37 RBIs. In 2000, Miller played for the Bisons again, was demoted to the Aeros and then released by the Indians.

Following a shortened 2020 NCAA Division I baseball season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, La Salle announced that baseball would be one of the seven sports to be dropped at the end of the 2020–21 academic year for sustainability reasons. When the Explorers took the field for their final season in 2021, they set a school record with 32 wins and tied a school record with 15 Atlantic 10 Conference victories. As a result, Miller was named the Atlantic 10 Coach of the Year.\nIn January 2022, Miller was named the head baseball coach at Penn State Abington.

The eight teams were divided into two conferences of four Welsh regions and four Irish provinces. Each Irish province played each of the Welsh regions and against two Irish provinces. Similarly, the Welsh regions played each of the Irish provinces and two of their Welsh counterparts. The top-ranked province from the Irish conference played the top-ranked region from the Welsh conference in the final .\nLeinster A won the first edition of the new competition, beating Scarlets A 15–8 in the final at Parc y Scarlets.\n2019.\nThe second season saw an immediate format change, with the competition defaulting to a single table, and a single round-robin format, each team playing all other teams once. Once more, the competition was run over eight consecutive weeks in 2019. The two highest ranked teams, regardless of nation, proceeded to a final, hosted by the team that finished first in the table.\nLeinster A retained their title, defeating fellow Irish province Ulster A 31–10 in the final at Energia Park."

He played college football at UConn and Eastern Kentucky before signing with the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent in 2018. He has also played for the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bears and New York Jets.\nEarly years.\nBoyle grew up in Middlefield, Connecticut, and attended Xavier High School in Middletown, Connecticut, where he won three championships under head coach Sean Marinan. A 3-star recruit, Boyle was the top-ranked quarterback in Connecticut his senior year, and accepted a scholarship offer from home state Connecticut over offers from Boston College, Delaware, Harvard, Houston, Maine, Massachusetts, Syracuse, and Western Michigan, as well as preferred walk-ons from Notre Dame, Oregon, Pittsburgh, and Rutgers.\nCollege career.\nWhile playing for the Connecticut Huskies, Boyle started 10 games and then transferred to Eastern Kentucky, where he started all 11 games as a redshirt senior and finished first in passing yards in the Ohio Valley Conference.\nProfessional career.\nGreen Bay Packers.\nBoyle signed with the Green Bay Packers as an undrafted free agent on May 4, 2018. After an impressive preseason, Boyle made the 53-man roster in September 2018, as the team's third string quarterback behind Aaron Rodgers and DeShone Kizer.\nBoyle did not play during the 2018 regular season. He saw his first professional playing time in a regular season on October 20, 2019, during a Week 7 win over the Oakland Raiders. Boyle took over for Rodgers during the final minutes of the game after victory was assured, kneeling the ball three times for −3 yards to run out the clock. He saw more extended playing time five weeks later on November 24 during a lopsided loss to the San Francisco 49ers, completing his first NFL pass to backup tight end Robert Tonyan, and finished the game 3-of-4 for 15 yards.\nBoyle was scheduled to become a restricted free agent following the 2020 season, but the team did not extend a tender to him at the start of the new league year, so he became an unrestricted free agent on March 17, 2021.\nDetroit Lions.\nOn March 22, 2021, Boyle signed a one-year contract with the Detroit Lions. He was placed on injured reserve on September 2, and activated on November 20, making his first career start in Week 11 in place of an injured Jared Goff. He completed 15 of 23 pass attempts for 77 yards, but also threw two interceptions in a 13–10 loss to the Cleveland Browns. He made his second career start in a Week 16 game against the Atlanta Falcons with Goff sidelined due to COVID-19, completing 24 of 34 pass attempts for 187 yards and a touchdown, but also threw a loss-sealing interception with less than a minute to play on goal-to-go, losing 20–16. In Week 17, against the Seattle Seahawks, he passed for 262 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in the 51–29 loss.\nOn March 14, 2022, Boyle signed a one-year contract extension with the Lions. He was released on August 30, 2022, and re-signed to the practice squad.\nChicago Bears.\nOn November 30, 2022, Boyle was signed by the Chicago Bears off the Lions practice squad.\nNew York Jets.\nOn April 6, 2023, Boyle signed with the New York Jets. He was released on August 29, 2023, and re-signed to the practice squad. He was promoted to the active roster on September 16. On November 19, Boyle replaced Zach Wilson late in the third quarter and completed 7 of 14 passes for 33 yards and an interception in a 32–6 loss to the Buffalo Bills. The next day, the Jets announced that Boyle would start against the Miami Dolphins in Week 12. In a 34–13 defeat, he completed 27 of 38 passes for 179 yards while throwing 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions; 1 of which was returned for a 99-yard touchdown by Jevon Holland. Boyle started again in the Jets' Week 13 game against the Falcons, but was benched during the fourth quarter in favor of Trevor Siemian as the Jets lost 13–8. After going 0–2 in his starts, the Jets released Boyle on December 5.\nHouston Texans.\nOn December 19, 2023, Boyle was signed to the Houston Texans practice squad. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 22, 2024."

        "title": "Disqualification of Jackie Robinson West Little League from the 2014 Little League World Series",
        "text": "The Jackie Robinson West Little League, or JRW, based in Washington Heights, Chicago, Illinois, United States, competed in the 2014 Little League World Series in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania. The team was very successful, winning the U.S. bracket of the tournament, before ultimately losing the championship game to a team from South Korea. Following the tournament, Little League Baseball was tipped that JRW may have been using ineligible players during their run to Williamsport. This led to a thorough investigation, which ultimately resulted in Little League Baseball stripping JRW of all its 2014 accomplishments on February 11, 2015.\nBackground.\nIn 1999, Little League Baseball launched its \"Urban Initiative,\" which led to the launch of inner city Little League programs across the United States, including the Jackie Robinson West Little League. Jackie Robinson West (JRW) was the second Little League formed from the Urban Initiative to make it all the way to the Little League World Series. The other was the 2002 Harlem Little League team from Harlem, New York City.\nThe 2014 Little League World Series was filled with many other notable storylines aside from JRW being the first all-black team to compete in the tournament in several decades. This was the first Little League World Series to feature a team from the state of Nevada, being represented by Las Vegas-based Mountain View Little League (which became the U.S. champion by default after JRW was stripped of its title). This Little League World Series also saw the appearance of Mo'ne Davis, the first female pitcher to win a game in Williamsport.\nInitial investigation.\nThe first warning signs that JRW was playing with ineligible players were noticed by Chris Janes, a coach and vice president with Evergreen Park Athletic Association Little League, who witnessed his team lose to JRW with the score of 43-2 during the Chicago City Little League tournament. According to Janes, he witnessed some of the players being toasted by communities outside of the team's district boundaries and, in some instances, outside of Chicago itself. After doing some personal investigating, Janes discovered that four or five of the players lived outside of the team's district boundaries – \"manipulating, bending and blatantly breaking the rules for the sole purpose of winning at all costs.\" By that point, JRW had defeated a team from New Albany, Indiana, to win the Great Lakes Regional tournament and had advanced to Williamsport.\n\"Three months later, reports emerged that Little League had investigated. Officials had found proof that Team Manager Darold Butler, Illinois District 4 Administrator Michael Kelley, Team President Anne Haley, and Team Treasurer Bill Haley conspired to recruit players from outside their district and cover their tracks by retroactively persuading officials in other leagues to alter boundaries.\"\nLittle League’s investigation and outcome.\nFollowing the completion of the 2014 Little League World Series, which saw Seoul Little League from Seoul, South Korea, defeat JRW 8–4 in the championship game, Little League Baseball launched an investigation into the actions of JRW officials prior to the start of the tournament. Little League initially saw no documentations suggesting that any of the players on the 2014 JRW team lived outside of the team's district boundaries. This led to Little League initially closing the investigation in December 2014.\nOther officials from neighboring Little League organizations came forward after the investigation was initially closed, saying that they had not wanted to upend the team's championship season. After top Little League officials interviewed the new parties in January 2015, they discovered JRW used a falsified district map which annexed three neighboring leagues into its district area. This map was backdated and submitted to Little League officials without the permission of the leagues that were added into JRW's district area. When JRW officials and Michael Kelley, the administrator for Illinois Little League District 4, which oversees JRW and several other Chicago leagues, tried to get all the neighboring leagues to approve this map, they refused.\nBecause of these findings, Little League Baseball announced on February 11, 2015, that it would vacate JRW's accomplishments during the 2014 Little League World Series, including the team's United States Championship and Great Lakes Regional Championship, among all others. Little League also announced that the team's manager, Darold Butler, had been suspended, and that JRW would be on probation until new management could be found to run the league. Little League also removed Michael Kelley from his role as administrator for Illinois Little League District 4.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the decision by Little League Baseball to vacate all of JRW's accomplishments, all the team's wins for that year's tournament were forfeited which, according to Little League's rules, goes down as a 6–0 win for the forfeiting team's opponent.\nAlso, by default,\nIn February 2016, the families of thirteen of the 2014 JRW players attempted to sue Little League Baseball, Chris Janes, ESPN, and ESPN personality Stephen A. Smith. They alleged that Little League Baseball and JRW officials had deliberately obfuscated details about the players' eligibility to \"reap the benefits of notoriety and media attention\", did not grant due process, that Smith made defamatory remarks on the ESPN program \"First Take\" that \"directly accused the JRW parents of perpetrating a fraud against the Little League\", and that Janes had violated their right to privacy by using license plates to identify the players' residencies. A judge ruled that Smith's comments were a personal opinion protected by the First Amendment, and removed both ESPN and Smith from the lawsuit in June 2017.\nIn September 2016, Janes filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court against Little League International, alleging that officials had knowingly covered up JRW's wrongdoing. After he filed his initial claim with Little League International, it was stated on December 16, 2016, that Janes' claim had no merit. The lawsuit stated, \"Subsequently, Janes and his family were subjected to public humiliation, death threats and fear for their lives.\" Janes alleges intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. He is seeking more than $75,000 in damages. A spokesman for Little League did not respond to request for comment.\nAs of April 2018, the remainder of the lawsuit remains pending. The New Albany Little League returned to the Great Lakes Regional championship game in 2018, losing again to a team from Grosse Pointe, Michigan, by a score of 13–0. A few days after their defeat, head officials of New Albany Little League asked Little League Central District to look into the residency of players on the Michigan team, fearing that they had been defeated the same way that JRW defeated them four years prior. No wrongdoings of any kind were discovered.\nIn April 2021, all claims against the team's volunteer coaches, who had been sued for fraud by Little League for their alleged roles in the eligibility scheme, were dismissed after the coaches filed a motion for summary judgment. A separate suit, brought by the players against Little League Baseball, Inc., Jackie Robinson West Little League, Inc., and its administrators, was settled a week later. The players did not sue the coaches, and refused to sign a statement they saw as implying blame on the coaches. Court documents showed that the players and volunteer coaches had no knowledge of cheating, although other adults involved with the program did."

The race was the 74th edition of the Vuelta a España and is the final Grand Tour of the 2019 cycling season. The race started with a team time trial in Torrevieja on the Costa Blanca.\nThe race was won by Primož Roglič of , making him the first Slovenian rider to win a Grand Tour. Rounding out the podium were Alejandro Valverde of in second and Roglič's countryman Tadej Pogačar of in third.\nAlong with the overall, Roglič also took the points classification. Geoffrey Bouchard of won the mountains classification, while Pogačar was the best young rider. Miguel Ángel López of was named the overall most combative, and Movistar Team won the team classification.\nTeams.\nThe 18 UCI WorldTeams are automatically invited to the race. In addition, four Professional Continental teams obtained a wildcard, bringing the number of teams to 22.\nThe teams that entered the race were:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI Professional Continental teams\nPre-race favourites.\nThe winner of the 2018 Vuelta a España, Simon Yates, had decided to not defend his title after riding in the 2019 Giro d'Italia and Tour de France. Steven Kruijswijk, Primož Roglič (Team Jumbo-Visma), Miguel Ángel López, Jakob Fuglsang (Astana) and Nairo Quintana (Movistar Team) were considered among the pre-race favourites. Fernando Gaviria (UAE Team Emirates) and Sam Bennett (Bora-Hansgrohe) were considered as potential stage winners and points classification contenders.\nKruijswijk climbed on the podium of the 2019 Tour de France, while his team partner Roglič got third at the 2019 Giro d'Italia. López was on the podium on both the 2018 Giro d'Italia and the 2018 Vuelta a España.\nThere were three previous winners among the participating cyclists: Alejandro Valverde (2009), Fabio Aru (2015) and Nairo Quintana (2016). Valverde (Movistar Team) and Thomas De Gendt (Lotto-Soudal) also attempted to defend their points and mountain classification titles.\nClassification leadership.\nThe Vuelta a España has four individual classifications, for which jerseys were awarded daily to the leading rider, as well as a team competition. The primary classification is the general classification, which is calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the team time trial (stage 1) and individual time trial (stage 10). The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the general classification, and wears the red jersey. The leader of the general classification at the end of the race is considered the overall winner of the Vuelta a España.\nThe second classification is the points classification. Riders receive points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stages. The points available for each stage finish are determined by the stage's type. The leader is identified by a green jersey.\nThe next classification is the mountains classification. Points are awarded to the riders that reach the summit of the most difficult climbs first. The climbs are categorized, in order of increasing difficulty, third-, second-, and first- and special-category. The leader wears white jersey with blue polka dots.\nThe final of the individual classifications is the young rider classification, which is calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage for each rider born on or after 1 January 1994. The rider with the lowest cumulative time is the leader of the young rider classification, and wears the white jersey.\nThere is also the team classification. After each stage, the times of the three highest finishers of each team are added together. The victory is awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative time at the end of the event.\nIn addition, there is one individual award: the combativity award. This award is given after each stage (excluding the team time trial and individual time trial) to the rider \"who displayed the most generous effort and best sporting spirit.\" The daily winner wears a green number bib the following stage. At the end of the Vuelta, a jury decides the top three riders for the “Most Combative Rider of\nLa Vuelta”, with a public vote deciding the victor."

Valverde went clear with a small group of riders on the steep Höttinger Höll climb, making headway on the descent with France's Romain Bardet and Canadian rider Michael Woods. Tom Dumoulin (Netherlands) joined the trio on the run-in to the finish, but his efforts to do so resulted in him missing out on the medals, behind Bardet (silver) and Woods (bronze).\nValverde's victory was the first for Spain in the event since Óscar Freire won the title in Verona, Italy in 2004. France and Canada also ended long streaks without a medal in the event as Bardet's silver was the first medal for France since Anthony Geslin won the bronze medal in Madrid, Spain in 2005, while Woods won only the second medal for a Canadian male rider in the road race, after Steve Bauer's bronze medal at the 1984 race, also in Spain in Barcelona.\nCourse.\nThe race started in Kufstein and headed south-west towards Innsbruck with a primarily rolling route, except for a climb of between Fritzens and Gnadenwald – as had been in the time trial events earlier in the week – with an average 7.1% gradient and maximum of 14% in places.

This was the first edition under the new schedule in which the PGA Championship is the second major of the year, having previously been the final one for decades. It was the third major and first PGA Championship at Bethpage Black, which hosted U.S. Opens in 2002 and 2009, won by Tiger Woods and Lucas Glover, respectively.\nBrooks Koepka won his second PGA Championship, and fourth major, by two strokes ahead of runner-up Dustin Johnson. By doing so he became first player to successfully defend both the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open in a career, and became fourth player to successfully defend two different majors in a career. At age 29 he became the only player currently under 30 to win at least four majors, and he returned to being ranked number one in the world. Johnson became the eighth player to have runner-ups in all four majors.\nKoepka hit a joint record PGA Championship low score of 63 in the first round, and a 65 in the second, to have the lowest 36-hole score in major history, and the largest 36-hole PGA Championship lead (7 strokes) in PGA Championship history. He hit a level par 70 in the third round, to retain a 7 stroke lead going into the final day. He held a healthy lead until a late charge from Johnson brought him within one stroke, but a four over par 74 was enough to get Koepka over the line.\nGiven his recent win in the Masters, and his 2002 U.S. Open win at Bethpage, Tiger Woods had a lot of media attention leading into the tournament, but missed the cut. Given the length of the course, long hitters were expected to do well, and Koepka and Johnson were among the favorites. Rory McIlroy was also among the favorites but finished tied for eighth. After struggling recently for form, Jordan Spieth finished tied for third in his attempt to complete the career grand slam.\nThe leading PGA Club Pro, and winner of his second Crystal Bowl, was Rob Labritz.

It was the second time Koepka had scored 63 in a major championship; the first being in the second round when winning in 2018. World number 119, Danny Lee was a stroke behind after a round of 64 which included eight birdies and two bogeys. Tommy Fleetwood was in third place, four behind Koepka. 16 players broke the par of 70, including world number-one Dustin Johnson. Masters champion Tiger Woods scored 72, a round that contained an eagle, three birdies, three bogeys and two double-bogeys.\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, May 17, 2019\"\nBrooks Koepka shot a second round 65 which included seven birdies and two bogeys. He set a new record for the lowest 36-hole score in a major championship and his seven stroke lead over Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth also set a 36-hole PGA Championship record and was the largest at the halfway point of any major championship since Henry Cotton led by nine in the 1934 Open Championship. Scott was the only player to score lower than Koepka, with a round of 64 than included seven birdies in the first 14 holes and a bogey at the 17th. Danny Lee, in second place after the first round, dropped six shots in his first seven holes and finished with a round of 74. \n82 players made the cut at 144, four strokes over par. Amongst those missing the cut were Masters champion Tiger Woods and world number 8 Bryson DeChambeau. Three PGA club professionals made the cut: Marty Jertson, Rob Labritz and Ryan Vermeer. This was the most since the number of qualifiers through the PGA Professional Championship was reduced from 25 to 20 in 2006.\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, May 18, 2019\"\nBrooks Koepka maintained his seven stroke lead after a level-par 70, a round that included three birdies and three bogeys. His seven shot lead after three rounds was a record for the PGA Championship, although he failed to break the 54-hole scoring record of 196 held by David Toms in the 2001 championship. Jazz Janewattananond and Harold Varner III had the best rounds of the day, both scoring 67 and moving into a tie for second place. Also tied for second were Dustin Johnson and Luke List. Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth both scored 72, dropping from second place into a tie for eighth.\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, May 19, 2019\"\nSummary.\nDefending champion Brooks Koepka won the championship with an 8-under-par score of 272. Leading by seven shots at the start of the day, he had five bogeys in the last eight holes but held on to win, two strokes ahead of runner-up Dustin Johnson. With three holes to play, world number one Johnson had closed to within a stroke of Koepka, but dropped strokes at the 16th and 17th holes. Patrick Cantlay, Jordan Spieth, and Matt Wallace finished tied for third place, six shots behind Koepka. Jazz Janewattananond started the day in a tie for second place but dropped seven strokes in the last seven holes and finished out of the top 10. Only six players broke the par of 280. \nRob Labritz won the crystal bowl as the leading PGA club professional at 290 (+10), tied for sixtieth place.\nFinal leaderboard.\n\"Note: Top 15 and ties qualify for the 2020 PGA Championship; top 4 and ties qualify for the 2020 Masters Tournament\"\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "Polar Park (baseball park)",
        "text": "Polar Park is a baseball park in Worcester, Massachusetts, serving as the home of the Worcester Red Sox, a Minor League Baseball team competing at the Triple-A level and an affiliate of the Boston Red Sox. Opened for the 2021 Triple-A season, it has a seating capacity of 9,508 people. Polar Beverages, a local beverage company based in Worcester, has retained the naming rights to the ballpark.\nDevelopment.\nThe stadium was constructed to be the home ballpark of the Worcester Red Sox, following the 2018 announcement by team owner Larry Lucchino and partners to relocate the Triple-A affiliate of the Boston Red Sox to Worcester, Massachusetts. From 1973 through 2020, the Pawtucket Red Sox were Boston's Triple-A affiliate (the team was a Double-A affiliate during 1970–1972), and played their home games at McCoy Stadium in Pawtucket, Rhode Island.\nThe ballpark architect was Worcester native Tommy Quirk of D'Agostino Izzo Quirk Architects (DAIQ), with assistance from consultant Janet Marie Smith, Executive Vice President of Planning and Development for the LA Dodgers, and who designed Oriole Park at Camden Yards. On September 13, 2018, the Worcester City Council voted 9–1 to move forward with the new ballpark, initiating the bonding process and tax increment financing (TIFs) for the surrounding area.\nDevelopment was expected to cost $101 million, with approximately $65 million to be paid by the city of Worcester. The $101 million figure would make the park the fourth most expensive minor league park ever built, adjusting for inflation. In September 2018, \"Deadspin\" reported that, according to College of the Holy Cross sports economist Victor Matheson, Polar Park would be \"in nominal terms the most expensive minor league ballpark ever built.\" In April 2021, a month before opening, the total actual cost was reported as $159 million, including $41 million for land, making the ballpark design and construction cost $118 million. The City of Worcester paid 55 percent, the team paid 38 percent, and government paid the remaining amount.\nThe stadium is part of a $240 million redevelopment of Worcester's Kelley Square and Canal District. Development of the ballpark area was to include 250 apartments, two hotels with a total of 250 rooms, a office building overlooking left field playing area, and of shops and restaurants.\nCeremonial groundbreaking of the ballpark took place on July 11, 2019, with local, state, and federal officials attending. On April 1, 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, construction work on the ballpark was suspended; it resumed after a seven-week pause. The final beam was placed on August 13, 2020. As of mid-August 2020, officials were still optimistic that the park would be ready for the start of the 2021 minor league baseball season. In late October 2020, the infield was sodded with Kentucky Blue Grass.\nOperation.\nWith the release of the 2021 minor league schedule, the first home game at Polar Park was initially scheduled for April 13. However, with the start of the Triple-A season delayed into May, the home opener was rescheduled for May 11.\nOn April 1, 2021, with construction of parts of the facility still continuing, Worcester Red Sox players took the field for their first workout there. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Massachusetts, attendance at Polar Park was limited during 2021, to 25% of capacity at the start of the season. On May 11, the first Triple-A game was played at the ballpark, with Worcester hosting the Syracuse Mets. All seating limits were lifted and the park was allowed to seat at full capacity as of May 29, 2021.\nOn October 23, 2021, Polar Park hosted its first football game as nearby Holy Cross played Colgate University in a Patriot League rivalry game.\nIn January 2022, ownership announced several upgrades to the park, including a new video board in right field and additional seating in right-center field to be called \"Papi’s Power Alley\"."

        "title": "2018 Asian Games opening ceremony",
        "text": "The opening ceremony of the 2018 Asian Games took place on Saturday, 18 August 2018, at the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium in Jakarta, Indonesia. The event commenced at 19:00 Indonesia Western Time () and ended at 21:25 local time. Wishnutama Kusubandio (then CEO of Indonesian TV network NET.) was the creative director of the ceremony. The ceremony featured a stage designed as a 26-meter-high mountain with a waterfall. It weighed 600 tons, was 120 meters long and 30 meters wide, and included a display of Indonesian plants and flowers, as well as a mock volcano. The volcano symbolized Indonesia's location in the \"Ring of Fire\" surrounding the Pacific Ocean. Host event broadcasting company International Games Broadcast Services (IGBS) filmed the televised coverage of the ceremony live internationally.\nProceedings.\nPrelude.\nBefore the ceremony commenced, footage of the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, leaving Bogor Palace for Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in a motorcade, was shown. When the motorcade was blocked by a parade of Indonesian supporters, the President exited his car, put on a black helmet and rode a Yamaha FZ1 to escape the traffic jam. After performing some stunt maneuvers and helping a group of students and a teacher to cross the road, he was joined by a motorcycle escort and approached the stadium. As the first part of the footage ended, a motorcyclist dressed as the President entered the stadium and headed to the basement. The second part of footage then showed President Widodo riding the motorcycle before reaching an elevator, at which point the real President entered the VVIP seating area.\nIt was suggested that the motorcyclist who entered the stadium was a stunt double: unlike the President, the motorcyclist did not wear a ring on the left hand. After the games' closing ceremony, Thai stuntman Withithep Komolhiran ( Suddum So) revealed himself on Instagram to be the President's stunt double in the filmed segments. He initially revealed his identity on Instagram after the opening ceremony, but the original post was later deleted. It is unclear whether the motorist performed live in the stadium was the same stuntman or not.\nCountdown.\nA ten-to-zero city central business district metropolitan countdown video was then shown featuring spots in Jakarta; the last two was the Jakarta's National Monument and the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium.\nMain event.\nAfter that, 1,600 high school dancers from 18 senior high schools across Jakarta performed the Ratoh Jaroe dance, a traditional dance similar to Saman dance from Aceh, the westernmost province of Indonesia. As their performance progresses, they changed the colors of their costumes and forming different patterns which evolved into the flag of Indonesia in the end. The dance was choreographed by renowned singer and dancer Denny Malik.\nDuring the Parade of Nations, North Korean and South Korean teams marched together under one unified flag of Korea. As per tradition, Indonesia as the host nation entered last. The \"Ocean Corridor Music\" was used throughout the 40-minute long segment.\nThe only dangdut song of the album, \"\", was chosen as the theme song for the 2018 Asian Games. It was written by Pay and sung by popular dangdut singer Via Vallen. She performed the song after all the athletes participated in the parade took their seat.\nThe ceremony observed a moment of silence to remember the victims of the recent Lombok earthquake right after the Indonesian flag was raised by the Paskibraka youth group troop. The troop comprised 70 students with 17 people as guides, eight people as flag bearers and 45 people as guards, which represents Indonesia’s Independence Day, 17 August 1945. After speeches from the Organizing Committee chairman Erick Thohir and president Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah of the Olympic Council of Asia, President Widodo officially opened the games.\n\"In the name of all the people of Indonesia, we are proud, we are honored, by getting special guests from 45 countries. In the 18th Asian Games, we, the nations of Asia, want to show that we are brothers and sisters, we are united, we want to achieve. And, with saying \"Bi-smi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīm\", the 18th Asian Games in 2018, I declare [it] open!\"\n– Joko Widodo, President of the Republic of Indonesia, declaring the games open in Indonesian.\nEight former athletes, who all had participated in the Summer Olympic Games, carried the OCA flag which was raised by the aforementioned troop. The former athletes were three badminton Olympic gold medalists, all in men's doubles; Christian Hadinata (1972 – albeit listed as 1978 Asian Games gold medalist since the 1972 event was not an official Olympic event), Candra Wijaya (2000), and Markis Kido (2008), two of the three athletes who won silver in 1988 women's team archery event – Indonesia's first ever Olympic medal; Lilies Handayani and Kusuma Wardhani, bronze medalist in 2000 Olympics women's 48 kg weightlifting Sri Indriyani, and two Asian Games medalists who did not win any medals in the Olympics; Lely Sampurno (silver medalist on 50 metre pistol in the 1962 shooting event, participated on 25 metre pistol event in 1984) and Suharyadi (gold medalist on mixed doubles in the 1990 tennis event, participated on men's singles in 1984 and men's doubles in 1988 and 1992). After the raising, Indonesian basketball player Arki Dikania Wisnu and badminton umpire Wahyana read the athlete's and referee's oath.\nSoon afterwards was the creative segments, divided into five parts: Water, Earth, Wind, Fire, and Energy of Asia. The water, earth, wind and fire depict the natural beauty of Indonesia and also the country's courage and competitive spirit, while Energy of Asia, the final segment named after the games motto, was about how future generations will help build Indonesia into a leader of tomorrow while remembering their guiding principles of respect and equality.\nDuring the Fire segment, there were Balinese-clad dancers carrying drums and some carried two-end torches. They formed a formation to make way for the final torch relay. The games torch was relayed by Indonesia's former Asian Games gold medalists; Lanny Gumulya (women's 3 metres springboard diving in 1962), Arief Taufan Syamsuddin (men's kumite 60 kg karate in 1998), Yustedjo Tarik (men's singles tennis in 1982), Supriyati Sutono (women's 5000 metres athletics in 1998), and Oka Sulaksana (men's mistral heavy sailing in 2002). Indonesia's first Olympic gold medalist Susi Susanti – who won the coveted title in the 1992 badminton women's singles – became the final bearer and lit the volcano's crater. It was followed by aerial and ground fireworks bursts which ended on the actual cauldron located on the southeast of the stadium; the flame itself lit up before the ground fireworks reach the end of the cauldron. The lit-up was followed by aerial fireworks bursts and a \"Set Your Soul on Fire\" song which sung by some singers, including Indonesian gospel singer Sidney Mohede.\nThe transition from the four elements segment to the \"Energy of Asia\" segment was filled by Indonesian-born French singer Anggun singing \"\"Pemuda\", a 1979 song written by Candra Darusman of Chaseiro band, who is the younger brother of politician Marzuki Darusman. He was also present during the ceremony. After some modern dances, the ceremony was concluded with the performance of the games' first-released official song \"\"\" sung by 4 of the song's artists; Ariel, Rian Ekky Pradipta, Sheryl Sheinafia, and Cakra Khan, complete with massive fireworks bursting from the stadium's roof.\nList of performers.\nHere is a list of artists and musicians who performed during the ceremony. All of them are Indonesians.\nParade of nations.\nAll 44 contingents participated in the parade, the order begins with Afghanistan and ended with host Indonesia. Each contingent was led by a representative official that wore a bird-shaped Garuda costume while carrying each country’s name placard. The costume was designed by Dynand Fariz, founder of the annual Jember Fashion Carnaval.\nReception.\nJoko Widodo's entrance drew comparisons to the London 2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony's segment, which featured Daniel Craig (as James Bond) and Queen Elizabeth II making an impressive entrance with a helicopter, and the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics closing ceremony's Warming up! Tokyo 2020 segment, in which the Prime Minister of Japan Shinzō Abe made an appearance by \"coming through\" Warp Pipe from the Mario Bros. video game."

        "title": "Archery at the 2018 Asian Games – Women's individual recurve",
        "text": "The women's individual recurve archery competition at the 2018 Asian Games was held from 21 to 28 August at the Gelora Bung Karno Sports Complex Archery Field in Jakarta, Indonesia. It was the eleventh time the event was held as part of the Asian Games sports programme since the sport's debut in the competition in 1978. A total of 68 archers from 25 nations participated. Jung Dasomi of South Korea entered as the defending champion, having won the women's individual gold medal at the 2014 Asian Games.\nSouth Korea entered as the dominant nation in the event, having won eight of the previous ten gold medals. They were however upset in the latter stages of the tournament, with their two archers in the elimination rounds, double Olympic champion Chang Hye-jin and top seed Kang Chae-young, being eliminated in the quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. These defeats led to the first women's individual event final at the Asian Games not to feature a Korean archer. The final was contested between Zhang Xinyan of China and Indonesia's Diananda Choirunisa, Zhang winning in five sets to claim her nation's first ever Asian Games gold medal in the women's individual discipline. Kang recovered to take third place, defeating Lei Chien-ying of Chinese Taipei to win the bronze medal.\nSouth Korea's trio of Kang, Lee, and Chang comfortably topped the 72-arrow ranking round held on 21 August, with defending champion Jung finishing fifth behind Lei Chien-ying of Chinese Taipei. Due to the change in the format of the ranking round, Kang's total of 681 was automatically registered as a new Asian Games record. As per the results of the Korean national selection trials held prior to the Games, Kang and Chang advanced as the two Korean archers to contest the elimination rounds despite Lee outscoring Chang in their 72-arrows to finish one position higher.\nThe elimination rounds began two days after the ranking round on 23 August. India's challenge ended in the 1/8 elimination round after Kumari lost to Lei by seven set points to three. The 1/8 elimination round also saw Indonesia's Choirunisa receive a walkover after her opponent, 2012 Paralympic champion Zahra Nemati of Iran, was disqualified for arriving at the competition site for the match 30 seconds late. Nemati told reporters that she had been sent for lunch, but shortly after leaving the site was told that the competition had resumed and was not able to return in time.\nThe top seven seeds each successfully reached the quarter-finals, which began just before midday on 23 August. The match between Choirunisa and Chang featured the biggest upset, with Chang delivering an uneven performance typified by a pair of sevens in her third set and the failure to win the fifth set to tie the game, allowing the Indonesian to take an unexpected victory by seven set points to three and advance to the semi-final. The \"Korea JoongAng Daily\" suggested Chang's defeat was due to the pressure placed upon her shoulders from national expectations to win gold medals in both the women's team recurve and the mixed recurve events, in addition to the women's individual recurve. South Korea's hopes of a gold medal were therefore pinned on top seed Kang, who had earlier dispatched Cao Hui of China in four sets to set up a semi-final tie with Cao's compatriot Zhang Xinyan.\nThe two semi-finals matches held later on the afternoon of 23 August saw two further upsets. Kang's defeat in the semi-finals to Zhang, who held a world ranking of 113, led to the first women's individual recurve final at the Asian Games without a South Korea archer present in four decades of competition. The failure to contest for a fourth successive gold medal in one of the team's strongest disciplines, as well as shortcomings by South Korean athletes in a number of different sports across the Games, led \"The Chosun Ilbo\" to describe the national sporting situation as \"desperate\" in the run-up to the 2020 Summer Olympics. The second semi-final saw Choirunisa triumph against Lei despite a head-to-head record that strongly favoured the Chinese Taipei archer. Choirunisa's win made her the first individual female archer from Indonesia to reach an Asian Games gold medal contest. The consistency shown by the Indonesian since the beginning of the elimination rounds was noted by Edi Purwanto of \"Pikiran Rakyat\" as key to her success, particularly in the final four sets of the semi-final when Lei's arrows dropped into the 7 and 8-rings.\nAfter a break of five days, in which the team recurve and mixed recurve events were completed, the competition resumed on the morning of 28 August for the two medal matches. Following the success of Kang, Chang, and Lee in the women's team recurve over Chinese Taipei the previous morning, Kang added a second medal to her 2018 Asian Games tally by defeating Lei in five sets to win the bronze medal.\nThe gold medal match was held right after the conclusion of the bronze medal match. In front of a crowd that included the President of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, Zhang claimed the gold medal with a perfect score of 30 in both her first and final set. Zhang's success came despite the Games being only her second senior international competition, her only previous experience being the fourth stage of the 2018 Archery World Cup in Berlin one month earlier. Choirunisa earned the Indonesia's second recurve archery silver medal of the Games after Riau Ega Agatha's loss to South Korean Lee Woo-seok in the men's individual event earlier in the day. Following a reapportionment of qualification spots at the 2019 World Archery Championships, Choirunisa's silver medal finish earned Indonesia a place at the 2020 Summer Olympics."

        "title": "1939 NCAA basketball championship game",
        "text": "The 1939 NCAA Basketball Championship Game was the final of the 1939 NCAA basketball tournament and the first NCAA tournament title game. The contest was held on March 27, 1939, at Patten Gymnasium in Evanston, Illinois, and determined the national champion in the 1938–39 NCAA men's basketball season. The Ohio State Buckeyes, the champions of the Big Ten Conference, faced the Oregon Webfoots, winners of the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC). Oregon won the game, 46–33, to claim the school's only national championship in men's college basketball.\nBackground.\nFirst NCAA Tournament.\nThe inaugural National Invitation Tournament (NIT) was held in 1938. The following season, a second postseason college basketball tournament was founded: the NCAA Tournament, which was originally organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC), although the NCAA did consider the event its basketball championship. The concept of the tournament was pitched to the association by Ohio State coach Harold Olsen. In October 1938, the NCAA announced that it approved the tournament's creation, as long as it was run by the NABC. The tournament featured an eight-team field, consisting of conference champions. The teams were divided into East and West regions.\nSeeking to control the amount of travel teams would face, the NABC decided to select the location of the championship game in advance. However, it did not do so until three weeks remained before the scheduled date of the contest. The site chosen was Patten Gymnasium in Evanston, Illinois, on the campus of Northwestern University. Olsen, the tournament committee chairman, made the arrangements for the arena to be used, as it was located in the center of the U.S. and could be procured with the NABC's available budget.\nOhio State.\nOlsen was the head coach of Ohio State in 1938–39; it was his 17th season in the position. The Buckeyes were coming off a 1937–38 season in which they finished third in the Big 10 with a 5–5 conference win–loss record and had an overall mark of 12–8. The team's captain was senior Jimmy Hull. a guard who made the All-Big 10 team. Other regular starters on the Buckeyes' roster included center John Schick, Dick Baker, Dick Boughner, and Bob Lynch. The team won its first game, 43–37, against George Washington on December 10 before embarking on a six-game trip to California and Washington.\nIn their six West Coast games, the Buckeyes lost four times. Two losses came against Washington, while the other two defeats were to California; Ohio State did manage two victories over UCLA and finished the road trip at 3–4. The team's play improved during the Big Ten Conference schedule, as its only losses were to Illinois and Indiana; the latter team held the lead in the conference standings until a February 27 loss to Purdue. That day, the Buckeyes defeated Michigan to climb into a tie for first with Indiana, as both teams had two losses in conference play entering their final games. On March 4, the Buckeyes posted a 16-point win over Purdue, behind a 20-point effort from Hull, while Michigan defeated Indiana 53–45. These results clinched the Big Ten title for Ohio State.\nThe selection committee for Ohio State's district—which included Ohio and several other Midwestern states—originally offered Bradley its NCAA Tournament invitation, but that school turned the bid down to participate in the NIT, where it finished third. The Buckeyes were the committee's second choice, and accepted the invitation despite Hull's later statement that the players \"were not interested in playing in this tournament\", due to fatigue and the tournament's perceived lack of standing at the time. In their first NCAA Tournament game, the Buckeyes faced Wake Forest. A 64–52 victory sent them to the national semifinals, where Villanova opposed them. Ohio State won by a 17-point margin to advance to the NCAA title game. The win gave the Buckeyes a season record of 16–6.\nOregon.\nThe 1938–39 Webfoots were coached by Howard Hobson, who was in his fourth season as the team's head coach. The previous season, Oregon had won the PCC's North division with a 14–6 record in conference play, before losing to Stanford in the best-of-three PCC championship series. The Webfoots returned all five starters from the 1937–38 team: center Slim Wintermute, forwards Lauren Gale and John H. Dick, and guards Bobby Anet and Wally Johansen. The team was nicknamed the \"Tall Firs\" due to its collective height, and employed a fast-paced style of play. The Webfoots began their season on November 29, 1938, with a 51–24 win over Portland, and won their next three games by double-digit margins.\nOregon went on a tour of the Eastern United States, which started at Madison Square Garden with a game against City College of New York. The Webfoots suffered their first loss of the season, 38–36. The December 17 game was followed by numerous stops in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia over the following two weeks. After a four-game winning streak, Oregon lost for the second time, falling to Bradley 52–39 on December 26. The Webfoots won twice over the next three days, before traveling to San Francisco to face Stanford on December 31, losing by a 50–46 margin.\nIn conference play, the Webfoots had a 14–2 record, finishing three games ahead of Washington for first place in the North division. Oregon reached the PCC championship series, where they faced California. The Webfoots posted a five-point win in the first game, before beating California again by a 53–47 score to claim the conference championship and earn the PCC's NCAA Tournament berth. The Webfoots' first NCAA Tournament game came against Texas, and a 56–41 win earned them a place in the national semifinals. There, they defeated Oklahoma by an 18-point margin, which gave them a berth in the NCAA championship game. Oregon had a record of 28–5 entering the contest.\nGame summary.\nThe national championship game was held on March 27, 1939. Although attendance figures vary, the contest was not a sellout. Tim Bannon of the \"Chicago Tribune\" reported the listed attendance as 5,500, while author Terry Frei gave a figure of 5,000. A contemporary reporter for \"The Oregonian\" gave an even lower estimate of 4,400, less than half of Patten Gymnasium's capacity of 9,000. Among those at the game were about 400 college basketball coaches, who had been in Chicago for an NABC convention. Also in attendance was basketball's inventor, James Naismith.\nOregon scored the first points of the game, as Anet rebounded a missed Webfoots field goal attempt and made his subsequent shot. Anet and Dick each made one free throw, before a shot by Johansen gave Oregon an early 6–0 advantage. The Webfoots played at a fast pace from the outset, a style of play that the Buckeyes were unaccustomed to. However, the Buckeyes managed to rally. Hull scored the team's first point on a free throw at approximately the 3:30 mark, and they scored the next two baskets. A pair of baskets by Lynch brought them to within one point of the Webfoots, 12–11, before two Johansen baskets and an Anet score brought Oregon's lead up to seven. Ohio State's defensive efforts were primarily aimed at stopping Wintermute and Gale; instead of featuring those players exclusively, the Webfoots spread offensive opportunities throughout their starting lineup, and Gale later called himself \"a decoy\" in the game. Hull responded to Oregon's run by making a hook shot, and after Dick made a field goal attempt Ohio State scored the last two baskets of the first half. The Webfoots held a 21–16 lead at halftime.\nIn the first minute of the second half, Hull scored a pair of field goals to reduce the Buckeyes' deficit to a single point, 21–20. Afterwards, the Webfoots made the next four baskets, including a pair by Dick, to extend their lead to nine, about three minutes into the second half. The teams exchanged scores until Anet gave Oregon a 40–29 advantage. By this time, the Webfoots had entered into a stall, keeping the ball away from Ohio State. The Webfoots kept the lead in double digits for the rest of the game, and claimed the NCAA championship by a final score of 46–33. On behalf of the Webfoots, Anet was given the championship trophy in what Dick called \"a two-handed trophy presentation\". During the game, Anet had chased after a loose ball by the boundary, near the area where members of the media were located. He accidentally knocked the trophy off of a table, breaking a basketball player figure.\nStatistical summary.\nAccording to unofficial statistics, the Webfoots were 17-for-63 on their field goal attempts in the game. Dick scored five of the field goals and added five free throws for 15 points, the most by a player on either team. Anet added 10 points, while Johansen had 9 points and Gale added 8. With 4 points, Wintermute was the only other Oregon player to score. Ford Mullen and Matt Pavalunas also saw action for the Webfoots, but neither player added any points. The Webfoots did not call a timeout during the contest; in contrast, Ohio State stopped play five times. When asked by Hobson why he had not used a timeout, Anet said that he was reacting to pre-game instructions by Hobson that Oregon only call a timeout if they were fatigued.\nThe Buckeyes' shooting was less effective than that of Oregon, as Ohio State converted just 14 of its 83 field goal attempts. Despite Hull dealing with an ankle injury that he later said caused him a high level of discomfort, he topped the Buckeyes with 12 points. The team's next-highest scorers were Lynch and William Sattler, each of whom scored seven points. Four other Ohio State players added either one or two points. The Buckeyes made five of their nine free throw attempts; both figures fell short of the Webfoots' 12-for-16 free throw shooting totals.\nAftermath.\nThe 1939 NCAA Tournament's attendance figures were not high enough for the NABC to avoid losses on the event. The reported loss was $2,531; Hobson said in regard to the attendance estimate, \"I think they gave half the tickets away.\" Lacking reserve funds, the NABC reached a deal with the NCAA in which the latter organization would take over organizing duties and provide financial backing for the tournament in later years, in exchange for underwriting the 1939 loss. Had such an agreement not taken place, the NABC intended to avoid staging a tournament in 1940. Instead, the move paved the way for the event to continue.\nOhio State finished 8–4 in Big 10 play in the 1939–40 season and did not qualify for the NCAA Tournament. The Buckeyes did not return to the tournament until 1944, when they began a three-year streak in which they reached the national semifinals annually. The team next played in the NCAA Tournament final in 1960, winning their only championship in men's college basketball. The Buckeyes have made three further appearances in national championship games, in 1961, 1962, and 2007.\nThe Webfoots were second in their division in 1939–40 before tying for third the next season. The 1945 NCAA Tournament was the next one in which the team appeared; Oregon lost in their first game. , Oregon has not returned to the NCAA championship game. The program's deepest run in the tournament since 1939 came in 2017, when Oregon reached the national semifinals. Seventy-six years after the 1939 NCAA Basketball Championship Game, Oregon and Ohio State also met on January 12, 2015, in the first College Football Playoff National Championship, a game in which Ohio State defeated Oregon."

        "text": "Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee 3D Golf is a video game developed and published by Incredible Technologies for the arcade. It was later ported to PlayStation and Windows. It is based on the popularity of golfer Peter Jacobsen.\nGameplay.\n\"Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee 3D Golf\" is a golf game featuring a trackball, and three 18-hole courses.\nThe game allows for up to 4 players at a time, and in the case of 2 players of more, allows you to play Stroke Play or Skins mode. These games always have 3 different courses per revision (with the exception of the home versions, which have six), with hittable trees or objects, lakes and cliffs (that are out of bounds). Golden Tee 3D Golf was used as the basis for the next games of the series until Golden Tee Fore, with the next games (97', 98', 99', 2K and Classic) being mostly the same except with different courses.\nHome versions.\nThe PSX and PC games (which happen to be one of the only home ports of the Golden Tee series), simply called Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee Golf are based on Golden Tee '97, sharing some of the menu assets (which are already shared on most revisions of the game) and the courses on it, but also include 3 new extra courses. The PSX version includes some extra modes and hole overviews on the start of each hole, but as there isn't any analog controller for PSX (by default), the trackball controls were replaced, as you hold Down in the D-Pad to adjust the power of your backswing (The game also seems to have support for Dualshock). Meanwhile, the PC version had support for LAN and Online, as well as Shadow Games that you could save and share to then play with a player from a previously saved shadow game as if it was playing with you. It also uses the mouse for analog input, allowing you to move the mouse backwards to adjust the backswing, and then forward to swing it (you can adjust the hit to make it go leftmost or rightmost if you move the mouse forward and to one of the two directions).\nReception.\nIn North America, \"RePlay\" reported \"Peter Jacobsen's Golden Tee 3D Golf\" was the seventh most-popular arcade game on location at the time. \"Next Generation\" reviewed the arcade version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \"This is a great golfing game that's even fun for anti-golfers.\""

Each canoe or kayak can hold one person (1), two people (2), or four people (4). For each of the specific canoes or kayaks, such as a K-1 (kayak single), the competition distances can be 200, 500, 1000 or 5000 metres. When a competition is listed as a K-2 500m event, for example, it means two people were in a kayak competing over a distance of 500 metres.\nParacanoe competitions were contested in either a va'a (V), an outrigger canoe (which includes a second pontoon) with a single-blade paddle, or in a kayak (as above). All international competitions were held over 200 metres in single-man boats, with three event classes in both types of vessel for men and women depending on the level of an athlete's impairment.

The coxed pair was graded as the fifth priority boat and Victorians Paul Guest, his King's Cup crew-mate Neville Howell and their Banks Rowing Club coxswain Johnston prevailed in a selection trial in Ballarat. They had to finance their own travel to the Rome Olympics, where as a coxed pair rowing in the only competing shell with its coxswain in the stern, they placed fourth in both their heat and repêchage."

        "title": "R.B.I. Baseball '95",
        "text": "R.B.I. Baseball '95 (stylized as RBI Baseball '95) is a baseball video game developed and published by Time Warner Interactive exclusively for the 32X in North America in 1995. It is the last game in the \"R.B.I. Baseball\" series to be released on a Sega platform, and follows \"RBI Baseball '94\".\n\"RBI Baseball '95\"'s history is curious as it was originally announced at CES 1995 for the Sega CD, as well as the 32X, priced in the US at $49.95 and $54.95 USD respectively. For some reason, the game instead moved onto a cartridge, effectively becoming a 32X exclusive, and its price at launch was upped to $59.95.\n\"R.B.I. Baseball '95\" was the first baseball game for the 32X.\nGameplay and updates.\n\"RBI Baseball '95\" plays differently from its Genesis/Mega Drive predecessors in one very noticeable form: Unlike any of the prior entries going up to \"94\", all of which had the player delivering pitches and hitting the ball from a view above and behind the umpire (with windows in the upper corners to show runners at first and third base), all instances of this now take place from the catcher's point of view, aimed to deliver a more \"up close and personal\" sense of realistic experience while making use of the Super 32X's software rendering and sprite scaling capabilities. When the ball has been hit, the familiar gameplay of the franchise returns, with the player and computer guiding the runners and defense across the baseball field to either get an out or score a run; as with traditional baseball, the game ends when a team has a higher score than their opponent at the end of the ninth or relevant extra inning.\nReturning for \"95\", in regards to extra modes, are the ability to play Home Run Derby, tour each stadium in an overhead view, look at the statistics of every team's players, play the traditional Game Breakers that have been present from \"RBI Baseball IV\" to \"94\", attempt to successfully master twenty different defense tactics in the Defense Practice minigame, and create teams; not returning for this game is Pickles, a minigame exclusive to \"94\" that required the player to use the defense to get out one or multiple runners in a single play, which like Home Run Derby and Defense Practice, gives the player twenty different scenarios per session.\nFor the first time since \"RBI Baseball IV\" in 1992, virtually all of the sprites of the players, umpires, field, and ball (among others) have been completely redrawn, making use of the higher palette of the Super 32X and increasing their sprite count for increased fluidity; this also would apply to the Scoreboard shown in between the start and halfway point of each inning. Some sprites and virtually every vocal cue by sportscaster Jack Buck from \"94\" are recycled for this game, though this came at a cost: due to possible technical limitations, and likely also the game's shorter development time, all of the short animated movies from \"RBI Baseball IV\" to \"94\" that would play in the first and third base windows throughout the game (such as fans doing the wave, a player having a close slide at a base, the spitball, the Basebrawl during a hit by pitch, and the coach delivering signs, among many others) had to be downsized in sprite dimensions and put in Grayscale; the Crazyball feature that was made popular in \"94\", which would replace all of the normal sound effects of the game with stock cartoon and gag sound cues, was also removed.\nAs how it has been with every entry since the Genesis/Mega Drive version of \"RBI Baseball III\", the Password system that \"95\" uses has unique codes that allows access to an Animation Test/Sprite Viewer, find hidden messages placed within the game's code by the developers, and the ability to play as the Warner Corporate and Dream Team for an extra difficult challenge (with Warner Corporate replacing Team Tengen, which was present from \"III\" to \"94\").\nReception.\n\"Next Generation\" reviewed the game, rating it two stars out of five, and wrote that \"\"RBI '95\" is not the worst baseball game, but for the first 32-bit baseball game, it makes no strides forward. Disappointing\"."

Asia won both events that were contested.\nFor sponsorship reasons the 2003 event was called the Phoenix Dynasty Cup presented by VISA while the 2005 event was called the Visa Dynasty Cup.\nFormat.\nThe teams consisted of 12 golfers. The tournament was played over three days with 6 foursomes matches on the first day, 6 fourball matches on the second day and 12 singles matches on the final day. One point was awarded for each win and a half point for a halved match. With a total of 24 points, a team needed to get 12.5 points to win the Cup.\nHistory.\nThe inaugural event was held 14–16 March 2003. The non-playing captains were Hsieh Min-Nan and Isao Aoki. Asia won by a score of 16½ to 7½.\nThe second event was held 15–17 April 2005. The team captains were the same as in 2003, Hsieh and Aoki. Charlie Wi was on the original Asia team but withdrew and was replaced by Angelo Que. Asia won by a score of 14½ to 9½."

        "text": "The individual eventing in equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was held at the Riviera Country Club (dressage), a specially built course in Westchester (cross-country), and the Olympic Stadium (jumping) from 10 to 13 August. NOCs were limited to three horse and rider pairs.\nCharles Pahud de Mortanges and Marcroix, the defending gold medalists, became the first equestrian pair to repeat as champions. They did so despite not winning any of the three stages.\nCompetition format.\nThe team and individual eventing competitions used the same scores. Eventing consisted of a dressage test, a cross-country test, and a jumping test. The total maximum score was 2000 points, with 400 available in dressage, 1300 in cross-country, and 300 in jumping. In the dressage portion, three juries gave scores out of 400; the average of the three was the score for the segment. In the cross-country section, penalties were issued for faults and for going over the time limit (with small bonuses available for finishing early); the total penalties minus bonuses were subtracted from 1300 to give the score for the round. Penalties were also given for faults and slow performances in jumping, with the total penalties subtracted from 300 for that round. The three segment scores were summed to give a final score.\nResults.\nStandings after dressage.\nChamberlin won the first portion of the eventing competition, taking a lead slightly over 7 points against his countryman Argo.\nStandings after cross country.\nWith 1300 points available, the cross country competition was by far the largest contributor to the eventing scores. The dressage leaders did not fare well in the cross country portion, with Chamberlin finishing fifth in the segment with 192.5 penalties and Argo finishing eighth with 392.5 penalties. Thomson, sixth after dressage, vaulted to the lead with a nearly clean round--incurring 35 time penalties in the open country but earning 6 bonus time points in the steeplechase. De Mortanges and von Rosen, second and third in the round with 58.0 and 58.5 penalties, moved into second and third place overall. The gap between von Rosen and Chamberlin--now in fourth place--was over 100 points, a very difficult distance to close with only the jumping portion remaining; barring disaster for one of the three, the medalists had largely been decided at this point and were competing with each other for final placement. Barriguete did not start the cross country portion; four others did not finish it.\nFinal results after jumping.\nArgo had a clean round, with no faults and only 0.75 time penalties, to make up significant ground on the field; nobody else had fewer than 40 penalties in the round. However, the three leaders after the cross country segment did well enough to each medal. Thomson, who had the lead, fared worst, incurring 60 penalties. This allowed de Mortanges, with only 40 penalties in the round, to overtake him and successfully repeat the Olympic championship. Von Rosen, with 40 jumping penalties as well, would also have passed Thomson if not for von Rosen's 2.75 time penalties--just enough to keep the Swede in the third position and give the American the silver medal."

        "text": "Moses Shirief-Lamar Brown (born October 13, 1999) is an American professional basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played college basketball for the UCLA Bruins.\nA center, Brown was named a McDonald's All-American as a high school senior in 2018. In his only year with UCLA, he was voted to the all-freshman team in the Pac-12 Conference. After going undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft, Brown spent his rookie season on a two-way contract with the Trail Blazers. He joined the Oklahoma City Thunder on a two-way deal for 2020–21 before signing a multi-year, standard NBA contract during the season.\nEarly life and high school career.\nBrown was born in New York City to Malcolm Brown and Wanda Williams. His father Malcolm was a center in junior college. Brown attended Archbishop Molloy High School in Queens, arriving with limited fanfare as a freshman. He was promoted to varsity in his second year, and flourished after growing and . In his junior year, he led Molloy to the Catholic High School Athletic Association (CHSAA) finals, where the Stanners lost 64–62 in an upset by Cardinal Hayes.\nAs a senior, Brown and junior guard Cole Anthony, son of former NBA first-round draft pick Greg Anthony, formed one of the top duos in all of high school basketball, as well as in Molloy's history. They led the school to the CHSAA's semifinals. Brown was voted the league's most valuable player (MVP). He was named a McDonald's All-American, becoming the school's first player to garner the honor since Kenny Anderson in 1989. Brown earned MVP honors in the Ballislife All-American Game.\nCollege career.\nBrown chose to play for UCLA over Kentucky, Maryland and Florida State. Rated a five-star prospect, he was the top newcomer in the Bruins recruiting class for 2018–19 that ranked in the top-10 nationally and also included Shareef O'Neal, son of Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal. Brown provided the Bruins with a replacement at center for the graduated Thomas Welsh. Although he stood , there was concern that Brown was underweight at . UCLA coach Steve Alford believed that he might still be growing and had \"his best basketball ahead of him.\"\nBrown was inconsistent as a freshman, dominating some games while being a nonfactor in others. In the season opener, he scored 19 points on 9-of-10 shooting, including five slam dunks, and had 17 rebounds in a 96–71 win over Purdue Fort Wayne. He was the first UCLA player to have 19 points and 17 rebounds in his college debut since Lew Alcindor, known later as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. On November 16, 2018, Brown had 23 points and 14 rebounds in a 95–58 win over Saint Francis to become the first UCLA freshman to record a double-double in his first three games. He nearly had a triple-double with eight blocks in 29 minutes, having left the game for good with around six minutes remaining. After facing smaller post players from small-program schools, Brown struggled offensively against Nick Ward of No. 11 Michigan State with only five points, 10 rebounds and three blocks in an 87–67 loss to the Spartans in the Las Vegas Invitational. In the consolation game, UCLA dropped its second straight contest to a top-15 team, losing to No. 7 North Carolina as Brown played just eight minutes before fouling out. On December 2, he had 12 points, 10 rebounds, and three blocks in an 82–58 win over Loyola Marymount. It was his first double-double since the third game of the season, and it came in his first matchup against a fellow 7-footer, the Lions' Mattias Markusson. On January 26, 2019, Brown snapped out of a two-week slump with 11 points, 15 rebounds and two blocks to help the Bruins end a three-game losing streak in a 90–69 win over Arizona. He missed the regular season finale against Utah due to an unspecified violation of the school's student-athlete code of conduct.\nBrown finished the season averaging 9.7 points and a team-leading 8.3 rebounds, and ranked fourth in the Pac-12 Conference with 1.9 blocks per game. He was named to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team and was an honorable mention for the conference's all-defensive team. After the season, he declared for the NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nPortland Trail Blazers (2019–2020).\nBrown went undrafted in the 2019 NBA draft. He joined the Houston Rockets for the 2019 NBA Summer League, playing briefly in one game.\nIn September 2019, Brown signed a training camp contract with the Portland Trail Blazers. He played in all five preseason games, averaging 5.2 points, 2.2 rebounds and 1.0 blocks in 6.9 minutes. Afterwards, the Trail Blazers converted his deal into a two-way contract. On October 27, they assigned him to the Texas Legends of the NBA G League. He was transferred back to Portland on November 9 amid multiple injuries to their frontcourt, including centers Pau Gasol and Jusuf Nurkić. Brown was sent to the G League on January 26, 2020. On February 29, Brown posted a career-high 25 points and 10 rebounds for Texas in a win over the Northern Arizona Suns. He appeared in nine total games for Portland, while playing in 30 for Texas and averaging 14.4 points on a team-high 64.1 field goal percentage in 19.4 minutes with team-highs of 7.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game.\nOklahoma City Thunder (2020–2021).\nOn December 9, 2020, Brown signed a two-way contract with the Oklahoma City Thunder. He played in the G League with the Oklahoma City Blue. For the week ending February 23, 2021, he was voted the G League Player of the Week after leading the Blue to a 5–0 record while averaging 19.8 points, 15.0 rebounds, 2.3 blocks and 1.3 steals per game. He was named to the All-NBA G League First Team after season averages of 18.5 points, 13.9 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 26.4 minutes per game. He was also placed on the NBA G League All-Defensive Team.\nOn March 14, Brown made his first career start for the Thunder, replacing a resting Al Horford in a game against the Memphis Grizzlies. In his second consecutive start on March 16 against the Chicago Bulls, he had 20 points and 16 rebounds for his first career double-double, which he already notched by halftime with 14 points and 10 rebounds. It was his fourth straight game setting a career high in points, which set a Thunder team record. He also had five blocks to become just the second player in team history to record 20+ points, 15+ rebounds and 5+ blocks in a game. On March 27, Oklahoma City announced that Horford would sit out the rest of the season as the team prioritized developing its younger players. That evening, Brown had career-highs of 21 points and 23 rebounds in a loss to the Boston Celtics. The rebounds tied a team record set by Steven Adams in 2018, and his 19 rebounds by halftime set a team record for rebounds in a half. Brown had the second-fastest double-double in Thunder history (8 minutes, 11 seconds). The following day, the Thunder announced that they had signed Brown to a multi-year, standard NBA contract. He had been averaging 12.4 points, 12.3 rebounds and 1.6 blocks in 27.7 minutes per game since returning from the G League. In the season finale against the Los Angeles Clippers, he had career-highs of 24 points and seven blocks, while also adding 18 rebounds. He ended the season with averages of 8.6 points and 8.9 rebounds.\nDallas Mavericks (2021–2022).\nOn June 18, 2021, Brown was traded to the Boston Celtics along with Al Horford and a 2025 second round pick in exchange for Kemba Walker, the 16th pick of the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-rounder. On July 31, 2021, Brown was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Josh Richardson. Dallas guaranteed his contract, but he did not develop into the player they expected. On February 10, 2022, he was waived by the Mavericks, freeing up a roster spot for them to land the players acquired in a trade that sent Kristaps Porziņģis to the Washington Wizards.\nCleveland Cavaliers (2022).\nOn March 10, 2022, the Cleveland Cavaliers announced that they had signed Brown to a 10-day contract, following an injury sustained by Jarrett Allen. He played in four games before re-signing with the Cavaliers on a second 10-day contract on March 21. On March 31, he signed a two-way contract with the Cavaliers and on April 10, they converted it into a standard contract.\nLos Angeles Clippers (2022–2023).\nIn July 2022, Brown signed a training camp contract with the Los Angeles Clippers, which was later converted to a two-way contract with their Ontario G League affiliate. On February 17, 2023, he was waived by the Clippers. He had been active for 50 NBA games, the limit for a two-way player, and the Clippers would have needed to sign him to an end-of-season contract to retain him. Brown appeared in 34 games for the Clippers and made one start, averaging 4.6 points and 4.1 rebounds while making 63.5% of his field goals.\nWestchester Knicks (2023).\nOn March 8, 2023, Brown signed a two-way contract with the New York Knicks. He was waived four days later on March 12, having only played in one game for their G League affiliate, the Westchester Knicks.\nBrooklyn Nets (2023).\nOn March 17, 2023, Brown was signed to a 10-day contract by the Brooklyn Nets. On March 28, he was re-signed to a second 10-day contract.\nReturn to Portland (2023–present).\nOn August 22, 2023, Brown signed again with the Portland Trail Blazers."

        "text": "The 2019–20 FIA World Endurance Championship was the eighth season of the FIA World Endurance Championship, an auto racing series co-organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series is open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars divided into four categories. World Championship titles were awarded for LMP drivers, LMP1 teams, GTE drivers and GTE manufacturers. With the new winter scheduling format, the series began at Silverstone Circuit in September 2019 and ended with the 2020 8 Hours of Bahrain in November 2020.\nSchedule.\nThe FIA and ACO announced a provisional schedule during the 2018 6 Hours of Silverstone which feature eight events over ten months. All events from the previous season are carried over, as well as the return of Bahrain which was not on the 2018–2019 calendar, and Interlagos which last held a WEC event in 2014. However, the length of the majority of events has been altered, moving away from the traditional six-hour format used in previous seasons. Bahrain in an eight-hour race and Silverstone and Shanghai are shortened to four-hour events.\nAfter Formula 1 announced their provisional 2019 schedule, the WEC moved the Fuji round forward one week to 6 October to avoid a conflict with the Japanese GP. This also avoids a date conflict with the scheduled date for the IMSA season finale, Petit Le Mans. Moving the Fuji round forward also allowed the Shanghai round to be moved forward one week to 10 November, which avoids a conflict with the traditional date for the Macau GP. On 2 December 2019, it was announced that due to the failure of the promoter for 6 Hours of São Paulo to fulfill its contractual obligations to the championship, the round would be canceled, and instead replaced by the 6 Hours of Circuit of the Americas. The FIA also moved the date back three weeks to avoid a clashing with Super Bowl LIV and the Mexico City ePrix.\nThe 1000 Miles of Sebring was scheduled for 20 March 2020, but was cancelled due to a travel ban to the U.S. from mainland Europe in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 24 Hours of Le Mans was postponed to September due to the coronavirus. The 6 Hours of Spa-Francorchamps was postponed on 16 March. On 3 April 2020, a new revised calendar for the 2019–20 season was released, with the Spa race moved to 15 August and another 8 Hours of Bahrain event, on 21 November 2020, replacing the cancelled 1000 Miles of Sebring. The final round at Bahrain in November was moved up a week as a result of Formula One scheduling a double header event at that venue for the end of the month.\nTeams and drivers.\nLMP1.\nNote* The #3 Rebellion R13 entry only appeared at the first and seventh rounds of the season and was not classified as a full season entry not receiving points in the World Endurance LMP Drivers &amp; World Endurance LMP1 Championship standings.\nNote* The #4 ByKolles ENSO CLM P1/01 entry only appeared at the sixth and seventh rounds of the season and was not classified as a full season entry not receiving points in the World Endurance LMP Drivers &amp; World Endurance LMP1 Championship standings.\nLMP2.\nIn accordance with the Le Mans Prototype LMP2 regulations all cars use the Gibson GK428 4.2 L V8 engine.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below.

        "text": "The individual show jumping in equestrian at the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles was held on 14 August. The event was called the \"Prix des Nations\" at the time. There were 14 competitors from 4 nations.\nThe same scores were used for both the individual and team competitions. While individual medals were awarded, none of the teams managed to have three riders finish the course so team medals were not awarded. The 18-obstacle, 20-effort course was 1,060 meters in length, and included two fences at 1.60 meters, a very difficult wall, and a water that was 5 meters in width. 100,000 spectators were present at the show jumping competition. The event was won by Takeichi Nishi of Japan, the nation's first medal in individual jumping. The United States also earned its first medal in the event, with Harry Chamberlin's silver. Clarence von Rosen, Jr. put Sweden on the podium for the first time since 1920 with his bronze.\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of the event, which had first been held at the 1900 Summer Olympics and has been held at every Summer Olympics at which equestrian sports have been featured (that is, excluding 1896, 1904, and 1908). It is the oldest event on the current programme, the only one that was held in 1900.\nTwo riders from the 1928 competition returned: eighteenth-place finisher Harry Chamberlin of the United States and twenty-fifth-place finisher Ernst Hallberg of Sweden.\nMexico made its debut in the event. Sweden competed for the fifth time, the most of any nation competing and tying Belgium and France for most of any nation; Sweden had missed only the inaugural 1900 competition, while Belgium and France were missing the individual jumping for the first time in 1932.\nCompetition format.\nThe course, designed by former American competitors John Burke Barry and Sloan Doak, was 1060 metres long with 18 obstacles (20 jumps). The maximum height of the jumps increased from 1.4 metres in previous editions to 1.6 metres in 1932; the long jumps increased from 4 metres to 5 metres. This resulted in a \"brutally difficult\" course that eliminated six of 11 riders.\nA single run was held, with the rider with the fewest faults winning.\nResults.\nOnly five of the riders finished the course, with the other six eliminated through three refusals. The Mexican team was entirely eliminated before the halfway mark (Mejia on jump 2, Bocanegra on jump 5, and Ortíz on jump 8). The tenth jump claimed two pairs, Francke and Imamura. Wofford made it the furthest of the eliminated riders, reaching the third refusal on jump 11.\nVon Rosen rode early and took the lead with 16 faults. Chamberlin bettered that with 12. Nishi was the final rider; he took the course slower than the others (incurring a 1-point time penalty) and finished with only 7 jumping penalties, giving him a total of 8 penalties and the gold medal."

It was established in 1906 and celebrated its centenary in 2006.\nHistory.\nHorsforth Golf Club was formed by a number of residents called together by Messrs. T. Clough and H. Whitfield at a house owned by Mr W.H. Billington on Outwood Lane in Horsforth on 8 November 1906.\nOn 8 February 1907 it was agreed to take a lease on a site on the Rawdon estate from Walter Egerton John Green-Emmott, of Emmott Hall, at a rent of £140 per year. The club was formally named \"Horsforth Golf Club\" at the first General meeting of the Club on 7 March 1907. Sir William Duncan, Bart, of Horsforth Hall was invited to become first President and Mr H Whitfield was appointed the first Captain. The clubhouse had its opening ceremony on 10 August 1907. \nThe course was initially laid out by the Greens Committee and the first Professional and Green-keeper, Mr T Tate. The course designer Alister MacKenzie visited the course in 1913 and made various recommendations for improvements and a scheme for bunkering the course. \nThe original clubhouse was destroyed by fire on 26 January 1913 and was rebuilt on its current site, reopening on 6 September 1913 at a cost of £1450. It was reported in the \"Leeds Mercury\" that the \"Suffragette Movement\" also caused damage to the club on 20 February 1913 affecting the eighteenth green and setting fire to a moveable shed used by the members as temporary accommodation. Vote for Women leaflets were left, \"leaving no doubt as to who the perpetrators were\".\nIn 1925 James Braid was invited to inspect the course, which he did on 19 March 1925, and provided a report for a fee of £14-5-0d. Many of his suggestions were adopted. In 1964, the golf course architect Frank Pennink was asked to appraise the course and help its redevelopment after new land was bought in compensation for loss of land taken over by the adjacent airport.

If Japan would have not ranked within the top four NOCs in \"either\" men's or women's on the ranking list, Japan's higher-ranked team between the two genders (if evenly ranked, Japan's women's team) qualified and only the top three teams in the rankings for that gender qualified.

The 20 teams for the OQT consisted of the OQT hosts, the three highest-placed teams at the 2019 FIBA 3x3 World Cup, and 16 teams on the world ranking list (with Japan being guaranteed a spot if not already qualified for the Olympics). The first ten quota spots for the OQT are open to any team that has not qualified for the women's Olympic tournament, but the remaining ten spots are subject to two restrictions. First, an NOC that has a team qualified for the \"men's\" tournament was excluded from these restricted quota places. Second, no more than ten NOCs from any given continent may compete at the OQT.\nThe final quota place was determined through the 2020 FIBA Universality Olympic Qualifying Tournament (UOQT).

Further, any NOC that has had a men's or women's team play in the basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics or basketball at the 2016 Summer Olympics tournaments was ineligible for the UOQT.

To shorten the competition, every competition (except 60 m individual sprints and 4x100 relay) had only four teams involved in a single knockout. Men's footvolley made its debut to competition, replacing Male Team Aerobics.\nFootvolley is the only 4-on-4 competition where teams are composed of members from different idol groups, and non-idol coaches provide instructions for two teams from the same bracket, so they have less likelihood of facing each other. Teams can bounce once before having to attack or defend, and touch between two teammates before hitting to the other side. Coaches can review twice, where all umpires and line judges (five members in total) will discuss the ruling, majority voting wins. First to 15 wins the round, best of three rounds wins.\nArchery reverts to full 10-shot format for all rounds. To avoid confusion, however, the elected ace member from each team takes the final four shots, while the other two take three each.\nTen-pin bowling was filmed on a separate location on a separate date. The scoring has also been simplified. A strike is 30 points, a spare, depending on the first attempt, is from 10–19 points. Consecutive strikes and spares do not add together, and no bonus frames after a strike on the 10th frame, so the perfect score remains at 300 points.\nCast.\nPresenters.\nJun Hyun-moo, Super Junior's Leeteuk and Twice's Nayeon hosted the show. Girl's Day Yura was the special host for male bowling.\nMain.\n\"Full 2018 ISAC Chuseok's line-up\"\nWanna One, Seventeen, Stray Kids, VIXX, NU'EST W, The Boyz, NCT, Astro, UNB, ONF, Blanc7, Golden Child, Myteen, 14U, and MXM, Shindong (Super Junior), Yang Sei-hyung.\n(G)I-dle, CLC, KHAN, H.U.B., Girlkind, GWSN, Nine Muses, Dreamcatcher, Limesoda, Red Velvet, Momoland, April, Pristin, ELRIS, GFriend, Cosmic Girls, Weki Meki, GBB, Twice, Fromis 9, Flashe, Hey Girls.\nResults.\nReferences:"

        "title": "2019 Major League Baseball season",
        "text": "The 2019 Major League Baseball season began on March 20, while the regular season ended on September 29. It was the 150th anniversary of professional baseball, dating back to the 1869 foundation of the Cincinnati Red Stockings. The postseason began on October 1. The World Series began October 22 and ended October 30 with the Washington Nationals defeating the Houston Astros in seven games to win their first World Series championship. The entire schedule was released on August 22, 2018.\nThe 90th Major League Baseball All-Star Game was held on July 9 at Progressive Field, home of the Cleveland Indians. The American League won, 4–3, for its seventh straight victory.\nThis was the final season when anyone on the 40-man expanded roster could be used in games from September 1 through the end of the regular season (so-called September call-ups).\nSchedule.\nAs has been the case since 2013, teams were scheduled to play 19 games against each division opponent for a total of 76 games, and six or seven games against each team from the other two divisions for a total of 66 games. The primary inter-league match-ups were AL East vs NL West, AL Central vs NL East and AL West vs NL Central.\nThe season began on March 20 and 21 with the Oakland Athletics and the Seattle Mariners playing in Tokyo, Japan, at the Tokyo Dome.\nExcluding international openers, March 28 was the earliest Opening Day in history. The previous earliest date was March 29 of the 2018 season.\nThe second annual Mexico Series of games featured four matchups during the season. The first featured the St. Louis Cardinals and the Cincinnati Reds at Monterrey, Mexico's Estadio de Béisbol Monterrey on April 13 and 14. The other series, also in Monterrey, featured two games between the Houston Astros and the Los Angeles Angels on May 4 and 5.\nThe Kansas City Royals faced the Detroit Tigers at Charles Schwab Field Omaha in Omaha, Nebraska, on June 13 for the MLB in Omaha game, only two days before the College World Series. This was the first MLB game played in the state of Nebraska.\nThe London Series featured the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox at London Stadium in London, on June 29 and 30 making it the first regular season series played in London, under a two-year commitment.\nThe MLB Little League Classic at Muncy Bank Ballpark at Historic Bowman Field in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, coinciding with the Little League World Series, returned to the schedule for the third straight year. It was played between the Chicago Cubs and Pittsburgh Pirates on August 18.\nSpring training.\nSpring training for the 2019 season began in late February and lasted through late March. Teams began workouts and practice for spring training beginning in mid February. Pitchers and catchers reported first, followed by position players a few days later.\nPrior to the start of the regular season, each team played between 22 and 35 spring training games, beginning on February 22. There were several times during spring training where a team had two different squads playing different teams simultaneously. In addition to spring training games, teams occasionally played exhibition games with non-MLB teams, such as Minor League Baseball teams, independent teams, or college teams. These exhibition games were not counted in spring training standings. Spring training ended on March 26, two days before the Opening Day.\nAwards and honors.\nAll-MLB Team.\nOn December 10, Major League Baseball announced its first-ever All-MLB team. Players were selected through fan votes (50%) and votes from a panel of experts (50%). The winners were selected based on merit, with no set number of nominees per position and no distinction between leagues.\nUniforms.\nChanges.\nOn November 16, 2018, the Miami Marlins unveiled a new logo, team colors, and uniform for 2019, as part of changes instituted by the team's new CEO Derek Jeter. The new design replaces one used since their 2012 move to Marlins Park and rebranding from the Florida Marlins to the Miami Marlins, and utilizes shades of red, blue, black, and slate.\nOn January 29, 2018, Major League Baseball stated that the Cleveland Indians had agreed to stop using their \"Chief Wahoo\" logo—which has attracted controversy as a stereotype of Native Americans—on their uniforms in 2019, as it was deemed to be \"no longer appropriate for on-field use\". The block C cap insignia will officially become the team's main logo; on November 19, 2018, the team unveiled new uniforms excluding the Chief Wahoo logo, as well as new hats with red brims for home games, a new red-colored home alternate jersey (marking the team's first red jersey since the 1970s), and sleeve patches commemorating their hosting of the 2019 All-Star Game. In order to maintain trademarks and prevent it from falling into the public domain, the logo will continue to be used on a limited amount of team merchandise.\nAll 30 teams wore patches this year on the right sleeve commemorating MLB's 150th anniversary. The patch was also featured on caps on Opening Day. \nAnniversaries and special events.\nThe following teams will wear commemorative patches for special occasions\nThrowbacks.\nTo honor the 150th anniversary of the Cincinnati Red Stockings becoming the first professional baseball team, the Cincinnati Reds announced on November 5, 2018, that the team would wear fifteen throwback uniforms. They wore:\nThe Pirates are continuing to wear 1979 \"bumblebee\" throwbacks on Sundays this season. The team wore mono-black uniforms July 20 as the 40th anniversary of the 1979 World Series-winning team was honored.\nThe Pirates and Brewers wore Negro leagues throwbacks June 1 and 7. The Pirates wore uniforms of the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Brewers wore the uniforms of the Milwaukee Bears.\nThe Twins and Royals wore Negro leagues throwbacks June 23. The Twins wore 1908 uniforms of the St. Paul Colored Gophers, and the Royals wore 1942 uniforms of the Kansas City Monarchs.\nThe Mariners and Astros wore 1980s–1990s throwbacks June 29.\nThe Royals and Nationals wore 1969 throwbacks July 6. The Nationals wore the 1969 throwbacks of the Montreal Expos.\nThe Phillies wore mono-burgundy 1979 \"Saturday Night Special\" throwbacks July 27. They were only worn once, on May 27, 1979. The Braves wore 1979 throwbacks, as well.\nThe Braves wore 1970's throwbacks August 1 to 4.\nThe Mariners and Astros wore 1980s throwbacks August 2.\nThe Orioles and Astros wore 1989 throwbacks August 9.\nThe Angels wore 1970s California Angels throwbacks August 16.\nVenues.\nThis was the Texas Rangers' final season at Globe Life Park in Arlington (formerly known as the Ballpark in Arlington and Ameriquest Field), where the team played its final regular season home game with a 6–1 win over the New York Yankees on September 29 before moving to Globe Life Field in 2020.\nThe stadium of the Seattle Mariners was renamed T-Mobile Park for the mobile provider (including its magenta-pink logo color as part of the park's branding atmosphere), after Safeco's contract with the team to call the venue Safeco Field expired at the end of the 2018 season.\nThe home field of the San Francisco Giants had its fourth name in its history since opening in 2000, but its first name outside the same company, as Oracle will pay an unknown but significant amount for a twenty-year agreement to rename the former AT&amp;T Park as Oracle Park. It also keeps Oracle's name on a Bay Area sports venue, as the Golden State Warriors left Oakland's Oracle Arena for the Chase Center south of Oracle Park at the end of the 2018–19 NBA season.\nBroadcast rights.\nTelevision.\nNational.\nThis was the sixth year of the current eight-year deals with Fox Sports, ESPN, and TBS. Fox aired eight weeks of baseball on Saturday Nights which led up to the 2019 Major League Baseball All-Star Game which also aired on Fox. Fox then televised Saturday afternoon games for the final four weeks of the season. FS1 televised games on Tuesday and on Saturday both during the afternoon and night. ESPN televised games on its flagship telecast \"Sunday Night Baseball\" as well as Monday and Wednesday nights. TBS televised Sunday afternoon games for the last 13 weeks of the regular season. Fox and ESPN Sunday Night Baseball telecasts were exclusive; all other national telecasts were subject to local blackout.\nTBS televised the National League Wild Card Game, Division Series, and the Championship Series. ESPN televised the American League Wild Card. FS1 and MLB Network televised the American League Division Series. Fox and FS1 televised the American League Championship Series. The World Series will air exclusively on Fox for the 20th consecutive year.\nLocal.\nUnder an agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice regarding Disney's acquisition of 21st Century Fox, the Fox Sports Regional Networks were required to be sold off to third parties by June 18, 2019. Fox also invoked a clause to give Yankee Global Enterprises the rights to buy their stake back in the YES Network. Including YES, the Fox Sports Regional Networks broadcast games for 15 of the 30 MLB teams. On March 8, YES was sold to a consortium including Yankee Global Enterprises, Amazon, and Sinclair Broadcast Group for $3.5 billion. Then on May 3, Sinclair and Entertainment Studios agreed to purchase the rest of the Fox Sports Regional Networks. The networks continued to use the Fox Sports branding for the rest of the regular season under a transitional license agreement.\nWGN-TV broadcasts of Chicago Cubs and White Sox games concluded at the end of the season. WGN held the local broadcast television rights of both teams since 1948. The network's final telecasts took place on September 28 (Cubs) and September 29 (White Sox). Effective with the 2020 season, Cubs games will move exclusively to the new Marquee Sports Network, while White Sox games will air full-time on NBC Sports Chicago.\nDigital.\nMLB's contract with Facebook Watch has been further downsized, now only consisting of six games (reduced from 25). In addition, the games will no longer be exclusive to the service, and subject to blackout in-market. The league also reached a new digital partnership with the streaming service DAZN, who now airs a daily studio program, \"ChangeUp\", which features live look-ins on games in progress.\nIn mid-July, MLB and Google announced that 13 games will air exclusively on YouTube, produced by MLB Network.\nRetirements.\nThe following players and managers retired from the start of 2019 season through Opening Day of the 2020 season:"

The Wolf Pack, led by fourth-year head coach Eric Musselman, played their home games at the Lawlor Events Center on their campus in Reno, Nevada as members of the Mountain West Conference (MW). They finished the season 29–5, 15–3 in Mountain West play to share the regular season Mountain West championship with Utah State. They defeated Boise State in the quarterfinals of the Mountain West tournament before losing in the semifinals to San Diego State.

Additionally, six transfers who averaged at least 13 points per game in their immediately previous seasons of college play will become eligible this season.\nAt the conference's media days in Las Vegas, Caroline and the Martin twins were named as preseason first-team all-conference picks for 2018–19, with Caleb Martin picked as the preseason Player of the Year. Jordan Brown, who headed the Pack's 2018 recruiting class, was named preseason Freshman of the Year.

In the following 2019–20 season, White adapted quickly to KHL play positing 15 goals and 34 points in 60 games to lead Neftekhimik in scoring.\nAt the conclusion of his contract with Neftekhimik, White left as a free agent to continue in the KHL with Latvian-based club, Dinamo Riga, on August 6, 2020. For 2020-21 season he changed back to the DEL and played for the Eisbären Berlin. In his first year for the team from the German capital he won the league championship. Also in the 2021-22 season he was again a DEL champion with the Polar Bears; White was the top scorer from his team in regular and post-season. In the final game against the EHC Red Bull München he scored a hat trick. \nFor the 2023–24 season White left Berlin and signed with fellow DEL club Grizzlys Wolfsburg."

British Car Rental sponsored the tournament, which was the last in the Snooker World Cup series until it was revived in a new format in 1996.\nDefending champions England with Steve Davis, Jimmy White and John Parrott lost their first round match to the Republic of Ireland, who then lost to Northern Ireland in the semi-finals. The Northern Ireland team of captain Dennis Taylor, Alex Higgins and Tommy Murphy experienced infighting between Higgins and Taylor fighting over the captaincy that erupted into a number of arguments, culminating in Higgins infamously threatening to have Taylor shot; this incident, along with a number of offences at the World Championship a month later, resulted in Higgins being banned from the game for the rest of 1990 and all of 1991. They went on to lose 5–9 in the final to the Canada team of Cliff Thorburn, Bob Chaperon and Alain Robidoux. Robidoux won the last frame with a 124 , the highest of the championship.\nTournament summary.\nBackground.\nSine the 1979 World Challenge Cup, a professional team tournament had been run every year except 1984; during the 1984–85 snooker season, the event was moved from early to late in the season. There had previously been an All Ireland Team, which won the tournament from 1985 to 1987. Alex Higgins, Dennis Taylor and Eugene Hughes were the team members for those three years. Later, there had been separate Ireland and Northern Ireland teams, neither of which had won a match at the competition since the change.\nThe 1990 Snooker World Cup was played at the Bournemouth International Centre from 21 to 24 March 1990, with eight teams participating. British Car Rental sponsored the tournament, which was the last in the Snooker World Cup series until it was revived in a new format in 1996.\nPrize fund\nPrize money was awarded as follows:\nTeams.\nThe participating teams for 1990 were:\nFirst round.\nDefending champions England led Ireland 4–1 but were defeated 4–5. Steve Davis and Anthony Kearney each won a frame when they played each other, then Jimmy White won both frames against Paddy Browne. Parrott won the next frame, against Hughes, and had a 58–4 points advantage in the sixth frame, which Hughes went on to win. Hughes and Parrott played the following two frames, which were both taken by Hughes. In the , Browne defeated Davis. The match between Canada and Scotland was level after each of the first three pair of frames, as Bob Chaperon and John Rea, Cliff Thorburn and Murdo MacLeod, and Alain Robidoux and Stephen Hendry all drew 1–1. Robidoux won the next two frames, against Hendry, to secure a 5–3 win.\nHiggins won three consecutive frames against Tony Drago to move Northern Ireland Team from 2–2 against the Rest of the World to a 5–2 win. Taylor and Silvino Francisco each won a frame in the opening pairing, and then Tommy Murphy and Dene O'Kane each took a frame when they played.\nSemi-finals.\nCanada eliminated Australia 5–1 in the first semi-final, with only King, against Thorburn, winning a frame for Australia. Taylor gave Northern Ireland a 2–0 lead by defeating Browne, making the highest break of the tournament so far, 71, in the second frame. After Hughes had equalised, Higgins defeated Kearney 2–0 and then won the against Hughes, to complete a 5–4 victory.\nFinal.\nCanada defeated Northern Ireland 9–5 to win the title. Robidoux won five frames of the six he played, and concluded the match with a of 124, the highest break of the tournament, in the 14th frame. At previous tournaments, Higgins had insisted that any of the team members winning the highest break prize should keep it for themselves rather than divide it between the team members. Taylor had recorded the highest break in the 1990 tournament to that point, a 71. Higgins was angered by Taylor's insistence that he would keep the £6,000 highest break prize for himself if he won it. At the press conference Higgins said \"In my estimation, Dennis Taylor is not a snooker person. He is a money person . . . He put money before country. He belongs back in Coalisland. He's not fit to wear this badge, the red hand of Ulster.\" Backstage during the match, Higgins threatened Taylor that he would arrange for him to be shot the next time that Taylor was back in Northern Ireland. The presentation of the prizes to the Canadian team was interrupted by a streaker protesting against the poll tax whilst wearing only two blue balloons.\nMain draw.\nResults for the tournament are shown below."

Nicknamed The Truck, he and fellow American Jimmy Rogers, who signed with Ármann, have been credited for revolutionizing the Icelandic basketball scene after they became the first foreign born professional players in the Icelandic Basketball League in 1975.\nEarly life.\nCarter grew up in Kansas City and played for Missouri Southern State University and Bishop College before being drafted by the Phoenix Suns 15th round of the 1971 NBA draft. He was released by the Suns in mid-June 1971 before playing any game.\nIceland.\nCarter joined KR in 1975, at the age of 25, after playing in Mexico and Sweden the previous two seasons, and immediately caught the attention of the fans and media with his powerful play and dunks. On November 11, 1975, in a game between KR and Valur, he was issued a warning and later a technical foul for repeatedly dunking the ball during the game, a move that was illegal by the rules at that time. The game officials where also worried that the bolts holding the basket to the ceiling would not be able to sustain his powerful dunks.\nThe first meeting between Carter and Rogers on December 16 was highly anticipated and did not disappoint. It was a tightly played and ended with an 86–81 victory for Ármann. But 54 second remaining in the game, and the score tied at 81–81, Carter got into a fight with Rogers and knocked him down. The punch was caught on a picture and made the front page of Dagblaðið the day after, as well as the headline in Þjóðviljinn \"Jimmy won the duel – The Truck won the boxing\". Both players received a one-game suspension for the fight from the disciplinary court of the Icelandic Basketball Federation and where threatened with a six-game suspension for any future fights. The verdict was highly criticized, both for the short suspension and for the threat of a longer suspension that only applied to them, as referees were worried that opposing players would try to harass them and goad into a fight.\nIn the end, Rogers and Ármann came out on the top in the league after beating KR in the last game of the season, guaranteeing them the first place and the national championship. Carter did beat Rogers for the scoring title, leading the league with 451 points, followed by Rogers with 365 points and Kristján Ágústsson with 337 points."

It was the inaugural event and consisted of three competitions – men's, women's and mixed team format. 16 two-player teams took part in both men's and women's competitions.\nThe event was part of the 2018 European Championships, the inaugural edition of the European Championships, a multi-sport event which took place in Berlin, Germany, and Glasgow, Scotland from 2 to 12 August 2018.\nIceland topped the medal table, with a surprise win in the mixed team event the highlight of a campaign that returned two medals. Hosts Great Britain and Sweden both returned two medals, the latter including the gold in the women's team event, while Spain triumphed in the men's team.\nThe format failed to attract the highest ranked players, with Great Britain's Georgia Hall, ranked 10th in the world, the only player from the top 200 in the World of either sex to participate. No further championships were arranged after the inaugural event, and golf did not reappear in the list of European Championships events in 2022.\nFormat.\nThe European Golf Team Championships took place at Gleneagles in Scotland from 8−12 August 2018, featuring a 50/50 gender split in the field with male and female professionals competing for equal prize money in a men's team match play championship, a women's team match play championship, and a mixed team 18-hole foursomes stroke play championship.\nThe field consisted of 16 teams of two players competing in the men's and women's team events, before combining to form teams of four (two men and two women) in the mixed team championship.\nThe men's and women's team championships featured a round-robin group fourball format, on 8–10 August, with winners of each of the four groups progressing to the semi-finals where foursomes will determine the winners, on 12 August. In the group stage, two points were awarded for a win, one point for a halved match, and no points for a loss. Ties between two teams in the standings were determined by their head-to-head result and if teams were still tied for first place then a sudden-death playoff would occur.\nThe mixed team championship comprised teams of four (2 men and 2 women) playing in 18-hole mixed foursomes stroke play on 11 August, with combined scores used for team's total score. Ties for medal positions were determined by a sudden-death playoff involving the low-scoring foursome from each team involved.\nQualification.\nQualification for the Championships was via the European Golf Team Championships points tables for men and women, which were based on men's Official World Golf Ranking points and women's Women's World Golf Rankings points earned from tournaments finishing between 10 July 2017 and 9 July 2018 with a maximum of three teams representing any one nation in each event.\nCompetitors.\nThe following competitors were announced for the championships. Rank is the Official World Golf Ranking (men) or Women's World Golf Rankings (women) in the week prior to the championship.\nResults.\nMen's team.\nPool play.\nTeams were divided into 4 groups of 4 teams and played round-robin matches Wednesday to Friday using the fourball format.\nMedal bracket.\n\"Sunday, 12 August\"\nWomen's team.\nPool play.\nTeams were divided into 4 groups of 4 teams and played round-robin matches Wednesday to Friday using the fourball format.\nMedal bracket.\n\"Sunday, 12 August\"\nMixed team.\nThe mixed team championship comprised eleven teams of four (2 men and 2 women) playing in 18-hole mixed foursomes stroke play on 11 August, with combined scores used for team's total score.

        "text": "Qualification for tennis at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan was determined primarily by the rankings maintained by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA). \nQualifying criteria.\nThe main qualifying criterion will be players' positions on the ATP and WTA ranking lists published on 14 June 2021 (after 2021 French Open). The players entering were formally submitted by the International Tennis Federation. The ATP and WTA rankings were based on performances from the previous 52 weeks, and there were several tournaments in the two-month period between the time of the rankings being frozen for entry and the beginning of the tennis events at the Olympics. Players had to be part of a nominated team for three Billie Jean King Cup (women) or Davis Cup (men) events between the 2016 and 2020 Olympics. This requirement was reduced to two Fed/Davis Cup events during the Olympic cycle from 2016 to 2020 if their nation competed at the Zone Group round robin level for three of the four years or if the player had represented their nation at least twenty times. All players were required to have been part of a nominated team for a Fed/Davis Cup event in 2019 or 2020, and to have had a good standing with their National Olympic Committee.\nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) could enter 6 male and 6 female athletes, with a maximum of 4 entries in the individual events, and 2 pairs in the doubles events. A total of 172 athletes will qualify to compete.\nFor the singles competitions, the top 56 players in the world rankings on a later date to be announced of the WTA and ATP tours are qualified for the Olympics. However, entry has been limited to four players from a country. This means that players who are ranked in the top 56 but represent the NOCs with four higher-ranked players already participating do not qualify, allowing players who are ranked outside of the top 56 but from countries with fewer than four players already qualified to compete. A player could only participate if they been part of a final nominated team to represent their country in Davis Cup or Billie Jean King Cup (formerly known as Fed Cup) ties on three occasions during the olympic cycle, with one of the years featuring a nomination being either 2019 or 2020–21. The required nominations was reduced to two if the player represented a nation spending at least three of the four seasons in the Olympic cycle on the zonal level of the relevant Cup or had been nominated for at least 20 ties during their career. Six of the remaining eight slots will be allocated by continent: two in the 2019 Pan American Games, one in the 2018 Asian Games, one in the 2019 African Games, and one each for Europe and Oceania for the highest-ranked athlete from an NOC with no other qualifiers. The final two spots are reserved, one for the host nation and one for a previous Olympic gold medalist or Grand Slam champion who didn't secure a direct entry.\nIn the men's and women's doubles competitions, 32 teams qualify. Up to 10 places are reserved for players in the top 10 of the doubles ranking, who could select any player from their NOC ranked in the top 300. Slots were then allocated to teams with the best combined ranking until 24 teams had been qualified. If the quota of 86 players in the relevant gender had not yet been met, additional places continued to be allotted via combined ranking. Once the quota was met, remaining teams with both players qualified in the singles were selected based on their best combined ranking. If this resulted in fewer than 32 teams, additional places were assigned to teams with one player qualified in singles, followed by remaining teams without any singles-qualified players if necessary. One team per gender was reserved for the host nation.\nNo quota spots are available for mixed doubles; instead, all teams have to consist of players already on site having qualified in the singles or doubles.

        "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for triathlon at the 2020 Summer Olympics . The competition at these Games will comprise a total of 110 athletes coming from their respective NOCs; each has been allowed to enter a maximum of three. All athletes must undergo a qualifying process to earn a spot for the Games through the Continental Qualification Events, the World Qualification Event, and then the Olympic Qualification List that began on May 11, 2018, and then concludes two years later on the same date.\nSummary.\nTen NOCs will each earn four quota spots (two per gender) through mixed team qualification. The top seven NOCs in the ITU mixed relay rankings of 31 March 2020 will qualify. NOCs other than those seven can participate in the 2020 ITU Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event, with three more teams earning Olympic quota places through that competition. This ensures a minimum field of ten teams in the mixed relay.\nThe individual rankings of 11 May 2020 will provide quota spots to 31 athletes in each gender. The first 26 spots will go sequentially to the best ranked athletes, subject to a limit of three per NOC (if all three are in the top 30) or two per NOC (if the third would be outside the top 30). For the purposes of this allocation, any NOC that qualified through mixed relay (and thus already has two quota places in each gender) must ignore its two highest-ranked competitors in each gender. Five additional spots will be awarded by continent, to the best-ranked remaining athlete from that continent whose NOC has not already qualified any quota places. A team that qualifies two individuals in both the men's and women's events will then be eligible to join the ten previously qualified teams in the mixed relay event. In 2021, seven further teams achieved at least two quotas in both events, and thus also qualified for mixed relay.\nTwo places per gender are reserved for the host, Japan. Two final places in each gender are awarded by Tripartite Commission invitation."

UC Irvine is a member of the Big West Conference, and participated in their 41st consecutive season in that league. The team finished the season with many new records that included a new school record of 31-6, longest game winning streak (17), and first ever NCAA Tournament win over Kansas State in the South Region 1st Round before falling to Oregon in the 2nd Round. Jonathan Galloway became the new program record holder of rebounds (969), career games won (95), career games played (146). Max Hazzard broke the Bren Events Center record for most three pointers made in a game on December 15 against Denver (10) and the team broke the school record for most threes made in a game that night with 18.

The competition was played under FIBA rules, which differ from NCAA rules. UC Irvine was defeated in the final game of the round robin tournament to Russia 92–91.

        "text": "The Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) is the governing body for equestrian sports in India.\nHistory.\nMost civilians could not afford to own horses in the period following India's independence, and equestrian sports were primarily practiced by Indian Army officers. The Army re-established several major horse shows across the country that had been halted during World War II. In 1950s, the Army began seeking opportunities to send riders to compete at international events. However, all international competitions were conducted by the Fédération Équestre Internationale (FEI) which required participating riders to be sent by national federations. As India did not have such a federation, the Army established the Equestrian Federation of India (EFI) in 1967. General P.P. Kumaramangalam, Major General R.K.R. Balasubramanian, and several senior army officers are credited with setting up the EFI. The Federation held its first meeting on 14 March 1967 and officially proclaimed \"the birth of the national Equestrian Federation of India\" and defined its objectives. One of the EFI's urgent tasks was to \"promote equine breeding and care and management of equines\" as the Partition of India had resulted in the loss of West Punjab, the best horse breeding territory in British India, to Pakistan. The EFI became affiliated with FEI in 1971.\nThe EFI played an important role in establishing the Asian Equestrian Federation in 1978. The EFI convinced both Indian government officials and FEI to introduce equestrian events at the 1982 Asian Games which were to be hosted in India. Keen to develop equestrian sports in the country, FEI Secretary General Fritz O. Widmer agreed to the request and asked the EFI to host show jumping, eventing, and dressage competitions at the 1982 Asian Games. The EFI agreed to hold the show jumping and eventing competitions but stated that it did not have enough experience to host the dressage competition. Instead, the EFI proposed a new event called tent pegging and drafted rules for the competition which was approved by FEI. Equestrian sports (show jumping, eventing and tent pegging) were included for the first time at the 1982 Asian Games."

Legally, it is a non-profit association registered under the \"West Bengal Societies Registration Act, 1861\". The federation holds elections for its office bearers every four years. The SFI currently oversees competition in the sports of swimming, masters swimming, synchronized swimming, diving, high diving, and water polo. It is affiliated to FINA, and the Asia Swimming Federation (AASF).\nThe SFI was formed by the merger of the National Swimming Association (NSA) and the Indian Swimming Federation (ISF) in 1948. Prior to the merger, the NSA and ISF had been engaged in disputes. While the Calcutta-based NSA received affiliation from FINA in 1932–33, the ISF had the support of the Indian Olympic Association. The Union Government intervened to resolve the dispute by merging the two entities to form the SFI.\nIn July 2017, FINA presented a certificate to SFI CEO Virendra Nanavati during the 17th FINA World Championship in honour of his services to the discipline."

        "text": "T10 cricket or Ten10 cricket is a short form of cricket. Two teams play a single innings, which is restricted to a maximum of ten overs (60 legal balls) per side, with the game lasting approximately 90 minutes. \nHistory.\nThe first competition using this format took place in December 2017, the opening season of the T10 League (now known as the Abu Dhabi T10) in the United Arab Emirates. The International Cricket Council (ICC) officially sanctioned the league. In May 2020, Eoin Morgan, the captain of the England cricket team, supported the idea of using the format at the Olympics, with former international cricketers Virender Sehwag and Shahid Afridi also supporting the idea. In June 2022, Cricket West Indies became the first full-member cricket board to start a T10 competition, which is called The 6ixty. Later that year, Sri Lanka Cricket and Zimbabwe Cricket announced plans to start their own T10 competitions in 2023.\nT-Ten Sports, the organisers of the Abu Dhabi T10, have helped organise T10 leagues in Zimbabwe and the USA. India will host the Indian Street Premier League, a tennis ball cricket league, in the T10 format in 2024, with over having been spent by the winning bidders in order to own the six teams in the competition. \nT10 leagues.\nIn 2019, the Caribbean Premier League featured two exhibition women's T10 cricket matches, each played before two of the knockout matches.\nIn May 2020, Cricket West Indies announced that the first edition of the Vincy Premier T10 League would start on 22 May 2020 but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Vanuatu T10 Blast started one day earlier in Port Vila. In June 2020, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) announced the commencement of the first edition of the PDC T10 League. A number of other minor T10 leagues have been started, such as the Cricket Fiji Vakataukata T10 League and the Malaysia T10 Bash.\nDifferences from other cricket formats.\nT10 cricket is notably shorter than other cricket formats; the shortest format of cricket played at the international level is T20 cricket, in which games are 20 overs per side and last approximately 3 hours. Because of its relative shortness, there is a greater emphasis on fast scoring and hitting boundaries.\nReactions.\nThere have been various positive and negative reactions to T10 cricket, all largely pertaining to the shortness of the format.

They finished the season 19–14, 9–9 in Big East play to finish in a four-way tie for third place. As the No. 6 seed in the Big East tournament, they lost to Seton Hall in the quarterfinals.

However, a core of veteran players – junior Jagan Mosely and sophomore Jahvon Blair at guard, sophomores Jamorko Pickett and Antwan Walker at forward, and senior guard/forward Kaleb Johnson – returned. Junior forward George Muresan, the son of former NBA player Gheorghe Muresan, made the team as a walk-on for the third straight season. Forward Trey Mourning, who had missed the entire 2017–2018 season due to injury, also returned to action in 2018–2019 as a redshirt senior, and the team hoped his perimeter shooting talents would pay dividends on offense. Most significantly, center Jessie Govan, the team's top scorer, who initially had indicated after the end of the previous season that he, like Derrickson, would leave school to enter the 2018 NBA draft, had changed his mind and decided to play his senior year at Georgetown in 2018–2019.\nA number of new players joined the team for the season. After sitting out the 2017–2018 season in accordance with NCAA transfer rules, forward Greg Malinowksi, a good perimeter shooter who previously had played for three seasons for William &amp; Mary – where he had shot 40 percent in three-pointers during the 2016–2017 season – became eligible to play for the Hoyas as a redshirt senior, and it was hoped that he would fill the gap left by Derrickson's early departure for the NBA. Freshman forward Grayson Carter also joined the team, and freshman forward Jaden Robinson made the team as a walk-on. Also new to the team was junior center Ömer Yurtseven, who transferred from North Carolina State; under NCAA transfer rules, he had to sit out the season, but he was expected to begin play with the Hoyas in the 2019–2020 season.\nThe arrival of three freshman – guards Mac McClung and James Akinjo and forward Josh LeBlanc – generated particular excitement in the basketball program and among its fans. LeBlanc was a versatile forward who was best known for his defense and his abilities in transition play. Akinjo was a skilled and high-scoring point guard, a position Georgetown had struggled to fill effectively since the graduation of Markel Starks in 2014. McClung had risen to national attention in high school with his spectacular dunks and high scoring; he had set a Virginia state record for points scored in high school a single season with 1,153, beating the old record of 948 set by his idol Allen Iverson, a former Georgetown and NBA great. Both in high school and in Kenner League play at McDonough Gymnasium on the Georgetown campus during the summer of 2018, McClung thrilled fans with his athleticism and dunking ability, and he and Akinjo dominated the scoring in Kenner League games that summer. McClung and Akinjo in particular provided star power to the 2018–2019 team that Georgetown had been missing for several seasons.\nOn October 11, 2018, Georgetown issued a press release announcing that Antwan Walker had been dismissed from the team that day. After Walker had begun to emerge as an important contributor to Georgetown's frontcourt late the previous season and followed that up with a successful summer in Kenner League play in 2018, observers had speculated that he might start for the Hoyas in 2018–2019. His departure suggested greater playing time for Josh LeBlanc, Trey Mourning, Kaleb Johnson, and Greg Malinowski in the 2018–2019 season.\nA preseason poll of Big East Conference coaches picked Georgetown to finish seventh in the Big East in 2018–2019. At the Big East's media day at Madison Square Garden in New York City on October 25, head coach Patrick Ewing dodged reporters′ questions about his expectations for the 2018–2019 squad, saying only that he was hoping for \"a much better year\" than in 2017–2018 and offering that \"everything\" about the team would have to get better for it to finish with more than the five conference wins it had the previous season. Ewing and Georgetown athletic director Lee Reed both believed that a good program had to be built slowly, and Ewing added, \"Last year, I said we were building a foundation...Now we’re starting to put the building up.\" He indicated that in 2018–2019 he would place an emphasis on getting the Hoyas to play together well as a team.\nNonconference schedule.\nWith Trey Mourning making the first start of his college career, the Hoyas began their season on November 6 with a victory at Capital One Arena against Maryland Eastern Shore, improving their all-time record against the Hawks to 9–0. Jessie Govan led the team with 13 points, while Josh LeBlanc had a double-double (11 points and 11 rebounds) in the first college game of his career. Jamorko Picket also scored 11 points, including three 3-pointers.\nFour days later, the Hoyas began competition in the 2018 Jamaica Classic, the Hoyas′ first appearance in an in-season tournament or showcase event of Patrick Ewing's tenure as head coach. The Classic was an unbracketed, four-game showcase event, and under its format the Hoyas started by playing a game at Capital One Arena against Central Connecticut State. The Blue Devils kept the game close, trailing by only three points with four minutes remaining, but Jamorko Pickett sank two three-pointers as part of a 9–0 Georgetown run that clinched the Hoya win. Jessie Govan scored 26 points, James Akinjo contributed 13, and Pickett and Trey Mourning added 12 each.\nBefore continuing play in the Jamaica Classic, Georgetown took part in the Gavitt Tipoff Games, an annual competition played between the Big East Conference and the Big Ten Conference which matched eight Big East teams against eight Big Ten teams. Georgetown had played in the Gavitt Tipoff Games during the first two seasons of the competition, losing to Maryland in both 2015 and 2016, but had not participated in 2017. This season, the Hoyas went on the road to face Illinois on November 13 in the most hostile environment the team had yet faced with Patrick Ewing as head coach. Georgetown's freshmen were particularly effective, scoring 61.3 percent of Georgetown's points and making key plays, including 12 points by Mac McClung that included a steal and breakaway reverse dunk to complete a 9–2 Georgetown run and give the Hoyas a 75–72 lead with just under five minutes remaining, a 19-point, seven-assist game by James Akinjo that included a floater and ensuing free throw to give the Hoyas an 84–80 lead with 39 seconds left, and 14 points and seven rebounds by Josh LeBlanc. Jessie Govan and Jamorko Pickett blocked back-to-back shots in the final seconds and Govan and Jagan Mosely sank key free throws as time wound down to give Georgetown an 88–80 victory. Govan and Jahvon Blair each finished with 11 points. The Hoyas improved their all-time record against the Fighting Illini to 2–4, their all-time record in the Gavitt Tipoff Games to 1–2, and their season record to 3–0.\nGeorgetown then made its first overseas trip under Ewing, traveling to Jamaica to resume competition in the Jamaica Classic with two non-bracketed showcase games at the Montego Bay Convention Centre in Montego Bay. Ewing, a Jamaica native who had emigrated to the United States at the age of 12, had accepted the invitation to play in the Classic partly because he wanted to show his players his birth country, and because Jagan Moseley's father and Jahvon Blair's parents also had been born on the island. The first game, against unbeaten Loyola Marymount, was the first meeting of the schools since 1979; the Hoyas led by five points at halftime, but the Lions had a strong second half in which they built a lead of as many as 15 points before handing Georgetown its first loss of the season, 65–52, behind 27 points by senior guard James Batemon. Two days later, Georgetown bounced back in the next game, in which the Hoyas fell behind former Big East Conference rival South Florida by 11 points early in the second half but pulled out a victory in overtime. The Hoyas then returned to Capital One Arena for the final game of the Jamaica Classic, building a 22-point lead against Campbell before the Fighting Camels staged a second-half comeback – largely thanks to 45 points by senior guard Chris Clemons, 27 of them after halftime – that brought Campbell to within six points of the Hoyas with 12 seconds left before James Akinjo made four straight free throws to clinch the win for Georgetown. Jessie Govan had a double-double (20 points and 11 rebounds) against Loyola Marymount, 27 points against South Florida, and 13 in the Campbell game. Josh LeBlanc scored 12 points against Loyola Marymount, narrowly missed a double-double in the South Florida game with nine points and 10 rebounds, and scored 11 against Campbell. James Akinjo finished with 10 points against Loyola Marymount, 14 against South Florida, and 17 against Campbell. Trey Mourning led the Hoyas in the Campbell game with a double-double (27 points and 12 rebounds, both career highs) and three assists.\nThe Campbell game began a three-game homestand that saw the Hoyas also face Richmond, completing a home-and-home series between the Hoyas and Spiders that had begun the previous season, and Liberty, the Flames′ first game against a Big East opponent since playing Georgetown in 2012. Georgetown won both games to stretch its winning streak to four. Jessie Govan scored a game-high and season-high 29 points and pulled down nine rebounds against Richmond, while Mac McClung broke out of an early-season slump to score 16 points, James Akinjo contributed 13, and Greg Malinowski scored in double digits for the first time as a Hoya with 10. Although Liberty was ranked sixth in the United States in defense, the Hoyas shot 53 percent from the field against the Flames five days later and went 19–for–29 (65.5 percent) in free-throw attempts, with Akinjo scoring 19 points, Govan finishing with a double-double (17 points and 10 rebounds), McClung adding 12 points, and Josh LeBlanc grabbing 10 rebounds.\nWith a four-game winning streak and a record of 7–1, Georgetown next went on the road to meet Syracuse before a crowd of over 24,000 at the Carrier Dome. It was the fourth year in a row the two schools – bitter rivals throughout the 35-season history of the original Big East Conference – had met in non-conference play. During the first half, the Hoya defense held the Orange to 7-for-27 (25.9 percent) shooting from the field and junior guard Tyus Battle – who had scored a career-high 29 points at Capital One Arena in the previous season to lead Syracuse to a comeback win over the Hoyas – to 1-for-8 (12.5 percent) shooting. The Hoyas went into the locker room at halftime leading 35–22; it was the second-fewest points Syracuse had scored in a half in the 38-season history of the Carrier Dome. In the second half, Georgetown quickly took its largest lead of the game, 37–22. Then, however, Syracuse went on a 14–2 run that included 10 points by Battle, and closed to a 39–36 deficit. With 11:51 left to play, Syracuse closed to 48–47 on a Battle jumper. A three-pointer by Syracuse redshirt sophomore Travis Hughes gave the Orange a 50–48 lead – the first Syracuse lead since 5–3 – which Syracuse extended to a six-point advantage. The Hoyas closed to 60–59 on three straight three-pointers by Greg Malinowski, then tied the game at 60–60 before retaking the lead at 65–62 with 4:50 left to play. With Georgetown leading 66–64, Orange freshman guard Jalen Carey hit a desperation three-pointer to regain the lead for Syracuse at 67–66 with 2:35 remaining. Govan hit a jumper to give Georgetown a 68–67 lead before Battle sank a three to put Syracuse back in front, 70–68, with 1:28 left. With a little over a minute remaining, Govan hit a three-pointer to give Georgetown a 71–70 lead, but Battle – who finished with 26 points – sank a pull-up jumper with 2.5 seconds to play to once again give the Orange a comeback win, 72–71; it was Syracuse's fifth straight victory. In the second half, Syracuse shot 18-for-30 (60.0 percent) overall from the field, including 7 of 14 three-pointers. For the game, Georgetown committed 15 turnovers, and Syracuse scored 19 points off them. Govan had a double-double with 22 points and 12 rebounds, McClung finished with 18 points, and Malinowski had 11 off the bench, while Josh LeBlanc grabbed 12 rebounds in addition to scoring eight points. The game completed a four-year, four-game series between Georgetown and Syracuse, and it ended amid speculation that the schools would not play again in the near future, because the Atlantic Coast Conference′s decision to go to a 20-game schedule the following season would make it too difficult for the Orange to schedule Georgetown.\nAfter a week off, Georgetown met SMU at Capital One Arena in the first game of a home-and-home series in which the Hoyas were scheduled to travel to play at SMU the following season. It was only the second meeting of the schools, and the first since Georgetown defeated SMU during the 1984 NCAA tournament in the days when Patrick Ewing was a Georgetown player. The Mustangs shot 10–for–25 (40.0 percent) from three-point range, while the Hoyas shot only 40 percent overall from the field and 4–for–18 (22.2 percent) from beyond the arc. In the final six minutes, the Hoyas missed seven of their eight field goal attempts, and the Mustangs sank five out of six free throws during the final minute to clinch the victory. Georgetown suffered back-to-back losses for the first time in the 2018–2019 season, falling to 7–3. Jessie Govan scored 17 points, James Akinjo contributed 16, and Mac McClung added 13.\nThe Hoyas concluded their non-conference schedule with three more home games, facing Appalachian State, Little Rock (coached by Patrick Ewing's onetime New York Knicks teammate Darrell Walker), and Howard. Georgetown pulled away from Appalachian State late in the game for a 10-point victory over the Mountaineers, but Trey Mourning suffered a concussion during the game and missed the next six games, leaving it to Josh LeBlanc to start in his place. In a shoot-out with Little Rock, Mac McClung scored a career-high 38 points and James Akinjo finished with a career-high 25 points, but Little Rock freshman forward Nikola Maric also had a career high with 27 points, and Trojans junior guard Ryan Pippins tied the game at 84–84 on a three-pointer at the buzzer to force overtime. Little Rock took an 89–88 lead in overtime before McClung sparked a 12–2 Hoya run that finally clinched a 102–94 Georgetown victory. During the week between the Little Rock and Howard games, McClung suffered a sprained ankle that forced him to miss the next four games, but even with McClung and Mourning sidelined, the Hoyas decisively defeated Howard, 102–67, dealing the Bison their fourth straight loss, and giving Georgetown its first back-to-back 100-plus-point games since February 1966. In addition to their performances against Little Rock, McClung scored 14 points and Akinjo 17 points against Appalachian State. Jessie Govan finished with 12 points against Little Rock and had his fourth double-double of the season against Howard with 23 points and 11 rebounds. Josh LeBlanc had a double-double (10 points and 10 rebounds) against Appalachian State and another against Howard (22 points and 11 rebounds), the second and third double-doubles of his collegiate career. Greg Malinowski contributed 11 points in the Appalachian State game. Kaleb Johnson just missed a double-double against Little Rock, scoring 12 points and pulling down nine rebounds, while Jahvon Blair contributed 15 points and five assists in the Howard game. The Hoyas finished the nonconference portion of their schedule with a three-game winning streak and a record of 10–3.\nThe Little Rock game was the 1,400th Georgetown game broadcast by Rich Chvotkin, the radio voice of the Hoyas. Chvotkin had broadcast every Georgetown men's basketball game since his debut in the 1974-75 season opener with the exception of most of the games of the 1990–1991 season, which he missed when he mobilized for six months of United States Army Reserve service during the Gulf War shortly after calling the fourth game that year. Chvotkin's milestone was announced before the Little Rock game began and acknowledged with applause by the crowd at Capital One Arena as Chvotkin rose at courtside and waved in response.\nConference schedule.\nGeorgetown opened its Big East conference schedule on January 2 with a win at Butler in which Greg Malinowski had his best game as a Hoya, scoring a career-high and game-high 26 points on 10-for-12 (83.3 percent) shooting from the field overall, going a career-best 6-for-7 (85.7 percent) from three-point range, and grabbing seven rebounds; he scored both the final six points of the first half and the first six points of the second half, moving Georgetown from a 38–34 deficit late in the first half to a 46–38 lead soon after halftime. Jessie Govan added 17 points and Josh LeBlanc and James Akinjo each contributed 12 against the Bulldogs. Three days later, the Hoyas faced St. John's – the 112th meeting of the schools – in Georgetown's Big East home opener at Capital One Arena. For the first time since the home game with St. John's the previous season, Georgetown had five players score in double figures – Jessie Govan with 25 points, James Akinjo with 17, Greg Malinowski and Jamorko Pickett with 13 each, and Josh LeBlanc with a double-double (12 points and 12 rebounds) – but St. John's also had five players score in double figures, led by junior guard Shamorie Ponds with 37 points, and the Red Storm won in overtime. It was the Red Storm's first victory on the road at Georgetown since January 18, 2003, snapping a 13-game St. John's losing streak in games played at Georgetown. It also ended Georgetown's second four-game winning streak of the year, and the Hoyas would not win more than two in a row for the rest of the season.\nFour days later, Georgetown lost its second game in a row as the Hoyas made their first six three-pointers and pulled out to a 39–22 lead at Xavier, but went 3-for-21 from beyond the arc after that and blew their lead when Xavier went on a 17–0 run to tie the game at 39–39. Xavier denied the Hoyas an inside game by shifting to an effective zone defense late in the first half and won 81–75. Jessie Govan scored 27 points, James Akinjo added 13, and Greg Malinowski finished with 12, but the Hoyas lost to the Musketeers for the sixth time in a row and ninth time in the last 10 meetings, and their all-time record against Xavier fell to 4–14. For the season, Georgetown fell to 11–5 overall and 1–2 in the Big East.\nGeorgetown returned to Capital One Arena to open a three-game homestand by facing Providence. The game saw 26 ties and 13 lead changes and was tied at 73–73 at the end of regulation thanks to a long three-pointer at the buzzer by Mac McClung, who returned to action after sitting out four games with a sprained ankle and finished with 16 points. In the final seconds of the first overtime period, James Akinjo – who finished with 20 points and nine assists – hit three free throws and sank a three-pointer to tie the game at 86–86 as time ran out. In the second overtime, Jessie Govan made five free throws to clinch a 96–90 Georgetown win; Govan had a double-double (14 rebounds and a career-high 33 points that included two clutch three-pointers). The Hoyas evened their Big East record at 2–2 and improved to 12–5 on the year.\nThe Hoyas next hosted No. 15 Marquette, their first ranked opponent of the season. Since losing their conference opener, the Golden Eagles had won three straight. Trey Mourning returned to action after missing six games with a concussion. Marquette junior guard Markus Howard – the fourth-leading scorer in the United States at 25.8 points per game – did not score in three minutes of play before going to the bench for the remainder of the game with lower back pain. Georgetown trailed sometimes by as many as six points during the first half, but nonetheless went to the locker room at halftime with a 40–37 lead. The Hoyas pulled ahead by eight points soon after halftime, but then went five minutes without scoring during a 14–0 Marquette run that gave the Golden Eagles a 57–51 lead with 10:27 remaining in the game. Georgetown came back to tie the game at 60–60 on a Jessie Govan three-pointer with 7:49 left. Marquette junior guard/forward Sam Hauser – who finished with a career-high 31 points, scoring 22 of them in the second half – scored on a jumper in the paint to give the Golden Eagles a 72–70 lead with just over a minute left to play. With 12 seconds remaining, James Akinjo attempted to drive the basket but Marquette freshman forward Brendan Bailey blocked his shot; then, with Georgetown behind 72–71, Akinjo – who shot 1-for-10 from the field and scored eight points – ignored Ewing's called play to kick the ball out to a wide-open Govan for a potentially game-winning three-pointer and instead drove the basket again, resulting in Marquette sophomore forward Theo John blocking Akinjo's shot easily. Hauser clinched a 74–71 Marquette victory – the first time the Golden Eagles had won four straight Big East games since 2013 – with two free throws with 2.7 seconds left; Mac McClung's half-court desperation shot that followed came after the buzzer. McClung led the Hoyas with 24 points, Govan finished with 14 points and nine rebounds, and Kaleb Johnson had 12 points off the bench, It was Georgetown's third straight loss to Marquette and eighth consecutive loss to ranked teams since beating then-No. 11 Butler in January 2017. The loss dropped Georgetown to 2–3 in Big East play, leaving Georgetown under .500 in the conference after five Big East games for the third straight season. Discussing Akinjo's late-game choices after the game, Ewing said, \"We just didn’t play smart enough at the right time, or share the ball at the right time...Twice James [Akinjo] drove in there...At the end of the game we ran a play for either Jessie [Govan] or Mac [McClung] or him to get the shot and he drove it and they came and blocked the shot. There were two people open. [Akinjo] has to play smarter. I know he’s a freshman, but it’s not time to be freshmen anymore. It’s the second half of his freshman year. We’re in the Big East, and these are games that you’re not going to get back.”\nThe homestand ended with a game against Creighton, and Ewing showed his displeasure with Akinjo by relegating him to the bench, the first time in Akinjo's college career that he had not started. Akinjo nonetheless played 30 minutes and had a career-best 11 assists, but poor shot selection plagued him as it had in the Marquette game, and he went 2–for–9 from the field and scored only six points, giving him an offensive output in the Marquette and Creighton games combined of 14 points on 3-for-21 (14.3 percent) field-goal shooting. The Bluejays snapped a four-game losing streak and defeated the Hoyas despite a double-double (22 points and 12 rebounds) by Jessie Govan and 10 points each by Josh LeBlanc and Mac McClung. The Hoyas had again suffered back-to-back defeats and had lost four of their last five games, dropping to 12–7 overall and 2–4 in the Big East. Georgetown's six conference games all had been decided by six points or less, two of them in overtime.\nThe Hoyas traveled to Madison Square Garden for a rematch with St. John's, then returned home to close out January with a rematch with Xavier. Georgetown won both games, avenging defeats at the hands of both teams earlier in the month. Against the Red Storm, Mac McClung had a game-high 25 points, Jessie Govan contributed 20 points and nine rebounds, and Josh LeBlanc had a 15-point performance. Against the Musketeers at Capital One Arena four days later, James Akinjo broke out of his slump to score 10 points as part of a late-game 16–7 Hoya surge as Georgetown handed Xavier its fourth straight defeat; Akinjo went 7-for-7 in free throws and led all scorers with 23 points, while Josh LeBlanc added 17 points, Govan finished with 12 points, and McClung scored 11. The two-game winning streak got Georgetown back to .500 in Big East play at 4–4 and improved the team's overall record to 14–7.\nGeorgetown's first game in February was on the road against its second ranked opponent of the season, No. 14 Villanova, at the Wells Fargo Center. The Hoyas led 34–33 at halftime, but by the time 5:48 was left in the game, the Wildcats had pulled ahead 58–53. While Georgetown went scoreless for six minutes late in the game despite averaging 83.2 points per game for the season, the Wildcats extended their lead, with Villanova sophomore guard Collin Gillespie scoring a career-high 30 points on 6-for-11 (54.5 percent) shooting from three-point range and 10-for-12 (83.3 percent) in free throws, and Villanova went on to win 77–65. It was Villanova's tenth straight victory, and the Wildcats posted a Big East record of 9–0 for the first time since the 2009–2010 season. Villanova improved its record at the Wells Fargo Center since the 2012–2013 season to 32–3, while Georgetown suffered its sixth straight loss in games played at Villanova and fell back below .500 in Big East play at 4–5. James Akinjo led the Hoyas with 19 points, while Jamorko Pickett finished with 10 and Trey Mourning came off the bench to add 12.\nThree days later, Georgetown visited Providence and came away with a road win, sweeping the season series with the Friars and dealing them their third straight loss. The Hoyas outrebounded the Friars 50–33 and outshot them both from the field overall, 44 percent to 37 percent, and from three-point range, hitting 7-of-18 shots (38.9 percent) from beyond the arc to Providence's 4-of-22 (18.2 percent). In a balanced attack by Georgetown's starters, Josh LeBlanc led Georgetown, finishing with a double-double (17 points and 11 rebounds), and Mac McClung had 13 points, six rebounds, and five assists, while Jessie Govan contributed 13 points, Jamorko Picket scored 12, and James Akinjo had 10 points and eight assists. The win again brought Georgetown to .500 in the Big East at 5–5, equaling their conference win total for the entire year in each of the previous two seasons, but two losses soon followed, a narrow one to Butler at Capital One Arena and a rout at Seton Hall that saw the Pirates take a 20-point lead early in the game in what Ewing described as Georgetown's worst performance in his two seasons as head coach. Against Butler, McClung scored 21 points, Pickett added 18, and Govan had 12 points and nine rebounds, while in the Seton Hall game Govan led the Hoyas with 20 points and Greg Malinowski scored 16 off the bench. In summarizing the loss at Seton Hall, the Associated Press described the Hoyas as \"young and exciting,\" but added, \"Unless they win a bundle down the stretch, or the conference tournament, they should be an NIT team.\"\nAfter a week off, Georgetown hosted Villanova at Capital One Arena. The Wildcats had lost two of the four games they had played since defeating the Hoyas early in February, but still were ranked No. 17. Mac McClung led the team in the first half, scoring 17 points as the Hoyas as a team went 7-of-18 (38.9 percent) from three-point range and built a 42–32 lead by halftime. In the second half, Villanova closed to 50–43 before Georgetown scored eight unanswered points to stretch its lead to 58–43 with 13:13 left to play. The Wildcats never got closer than nine points for the rest of the game, and the Hoyas came away with an upset 85–73 win. Georgetown outshot Villanova from the field 51 to 38 percent, and Georgetown's bench, led by Kaleb Johnson's eight points, outscored Villanova's 22–9. Jessie Govan had his Big East-leading eighth double-double of the season with 21 points and 11 rebounds, McClung also scored 21, and James Akinjo had 10 points and nine assists. The Hoyas snapped a nine-game losing streak against the Wildcats and beat them in a home game for the first time since January 2015. It was Georgetown's first victory over a ranked opponent since beating then-No. 11 Butler in January 2017, and it was the first time that a team coached by Patrick Ewing had defeated a Top 25 team in eight tries. It also was the first time that Villanova had lost back-to-back conference games in 104 Big East games it had played since joining the new Big East Conference in 2013. The win improved Georgetown's overall record to 16–10, exceeding its win total in each of the previous three seasons, and raised its conference record to 6–7.\nHoping to build momentum and make a case for a bid to the 2019 NCAA tournament, the Hoyas moved on to a game at Creighton three days later, but lost. Jahvon Blair led the team with 16 points, and Greg Malinowski scored 12, but overall the Hoyas came out flat for the game, their starters underperforming on offense and the team lacking a defensive solution for the Bluejays′ offense. After the game, Patrick Ewing declared that the NCAA Tournament was his team's goal, and that the loss had disappointed him because \"“Great teams back up what they did,” referring to building momentum following the win over Villanova, while “[a] mediocre team did what we did today,” meaning take a step backwards after a signature win. Discussing the matter with \"The Washington Post\" three days after the loss at Creighton, Ewing said, \"“We’ve been talking about our [Big East tournament] seeding and what our goals are, and our goal is to try to make the NCAAs. So we have to finish the season strong. We have to finish well in the Big East to have an opportunity to do that. I thought that the way we played versus Villanova, it was a great opportunity to build. We just didn’t have the energy, the focus, the fire that we needed to play the way we needed to come away with a great road win at Creighton...We have to have a sense of urgency. We only have four games left, and we’re still right in the hunt. We do what we need to do, and we could end up as good as third in the Big East tournament. But we need to play with more of a sense of urgency than we did in our last outing.”\nWith that challenge from their coach and a growing sense that an NCAA Tournament bid was a possibility, the Hoyas returned to Capital One Arena for their final homestand of the season, with games against DePaul and Seton Hall. Georgetown dealt DePaul its fourth straight loss, with Jessie Govan scoring 26 points, Mac McClung finishing with 15 points, and James Akinjo adding 13 points and six assists. On Senior Day three days later, the Hoyas played their last game of the year at Capital One Arena and faced a tougher challenge in Seton Hall. Georgetown trailed 28–24 at halftime, before taking the lead in the second half, but Seton Hall redshirt senior guard Michael Nzei tied the game at 59–59 with a jumper at the end of regulation to force overtime. The Pirates again tied the game at 66–66 when Seton Hall freshman guard/forward Jared Rhoden scored on a buzzer-beating dunk off a fast break at the end of overtime. Govan scored all 11 of Georgetown's points in the second overtime, hitting a three-pointer with 3:20 remaining to give Georgetown a 71–69 lead, then, after the Pirates tied the game at 71–71, sinking one of two free throws, a second-chance layup, and finally two more free throws with 10 seconds left to clinch a 77–71 Georgetown victory and hand Seton Hall its third straight loss. The Hoyas gave up 35 points to Pirate junior guard Myles Powell, but Govan and Josh LeBlanc both finished with double-doubles, Govan scoring 21 points and grabbing 12 rebounds and LeBlanc adding 14 points and a career-high 17 rebounds, while James Akinjo contributed 16 points. The back-to-back wins gave Georgetown a record of 8–8 in the Big East and 18–11 overall.\nBack on the bubble for an NCAA berth, and hoping to earn a No. 3 seed in the 2019 Big East tournament, the Hoyas went on a two-game road trip that began with a winnable rematch with ninth-place DePaul. However, both their offense and defense let them down; they had their worst shooting performance since the game at Villanova, with only James Akinjo and Mac McClung – with 13 points each – scoring in double figures, and their defense allowed four Blue Demons to score in double figures, including 30 points by redshirt senior guard Max Strus and 24 by senior guard Eli Cain. DePaul sank 14 three-pointers and scored 27 points off 15 Georgetown turnovers. DePaul pulled out to a 25–15 lead followed by a 17–0 run that stretched DePaul's lead to 42–15, and at halftime the Blue Demons led 54–31; the 54 points were the most DePaul had scored in the first half of a game all season. In the second half, the Hoyas closed to a 14-point deficit, but another DePaul run put the Blue Demons ahead by 38 points with just under three minutes to play, and DePaul won 101–69. The 32-point loss tied a loss at the hands of Villanova in January 2018 for Georgetown's biggest margin of defeat under Ewing, and it was the first time in Ewing's tenure as head coach that an opponent had scored 100 or more points against Georgetown. After the game, Ewing said, \"“I don’t have an answer for it. We’ve talked about the importance of this game for trying to lock in that third seed [in the Big East tournament]. And I just thought that we didn’t come with the right energy and the right effort for whatever reason...I guess we thought we were just going to show up and it was just going to happen. The reason why I was so proud of my team last game [against Seton Hall] was we didn’t start out playing particularly well, but our defense kept us in the game. Today, our defense was nonexistent. We couldn’t stop anyone.” Ewing blamed the embarrassing loss on Georgetown's lack of energy and preparedness, saying “We didn’t come ready to play. For as big of a game as this was for us, we didn’t come out with the right energy, the right effort, intensity that we talked about from after our last game. To a man. No one was ready to play, in my opinion.” In the tightly packed Big East standings, the loss dropped the Hoyas all the way from third to seventh place.\nGeorgetown closed out its regular season on March 9 at No. 16 Marquette, its fourth and final meeting of the season with a ranked opponent. The Golden Eagles had lost three in a row, and were trying to avoid a fourth straight loss to end their season. The Golden Eagles led 39–37 at halftime and extended their lead to 60–53 with 10:57 left in the game, but the Hoyas came back to tie it at 63–63. Late in the game Jamorko Pickett sank a three-pointer to give Georgetown an 82–77 lead. Marquette redshirt freshman Joey Hauser responded with a three to reduce Georgetown's advantage to 82–80 with 46 seconds to play. Jessie Govan hit one of two free throws to make the score 83–80, but Marquette junior guard Markus Howard was fouled on the next possession and also hit one of two free throws to close to 83–81 with 11 seconds left. After James Akinjo made two free throws to extend Georgetown's lead to 85–81, Howard scored on a three-pointer to cut it to 85–84. Pickett then made the first of two free throws with 2 seconds to play, time expired during the struggle to grab the rebound after he missed the second, and the Hoyas upset the Golden Eagles 86–84. Marquette shot only 23–for-67 (34.3 percent) from the field, and went 26-for-36 (72.2 percent) from the free-throw line, below their 77-percent free-throw success rate for the season. Akinjo led the Hoyas with 25 points, Mac McClung added 23, and Govan and Pickett finished with 10 points each.\nGeorgetown concluded its regular season with a record of 19–12 overall and 9–9 in the Big East, in both cases their best record since the 2014–2015 season, and in a four-way tie for third place in the Big East, its best finish in the conference since the 2014–2015 season. It was also the Hoyas′ first overall winning record and first non-losing conference season since the 2014–2015 season. They had gone 2–2 against Top 25 teams, but had played inconsistently, winning back-to-back Big East games only twice all season. Speaking after the victory over Marquette, Ewing said, \"We had a great win today and it would be a shame if we don't follow it up on Thursday\" – in Georgetown's first game of the upcoming Big East tournament – \"with another great performance. So, we have to build on it.\"\nBig East tournament.\nUnder tie-breaking criteria, Georgetown was seeded sixth in the 2019 Big East tournament and received a first-round bye in the tournament for the first time since 2015. In the quarterfinals, the Hoyas faced Seton Hall, which, like Georgetown had finished at 9–9 and in a four-way tie for third place in the regular season but had been seeded third based on tie-breakers. In a decisive first half, Pirates junior guard Myles Powell scored 29 points – a tournament record for a single half, beating the 27 points Doug McDermott scored for Creighton in a single half in a game against DePaul during the 2014 tournament – shooting 10-for-14 (71.4 percent) from the field overall and 4-for-7 (57.1 percent) in three-pointers, and he finished the half by scoring 13 straight points that included three three-pointers and an end-to-end drive for a layup. Georgetown, meanwhile, committed 10 turnovers during the half that resulted in 20 Seton Hall points, and the Pirates led 53–28 at halftime. Powell cooled off after halftime, but the Hoyas never got closer than 14 points, and Seton Hall won 73–57, knocking Georgetown out of the tournament. James Akinjo led the Hoyas with 15 points, and was the only Hoya to score in double figures.\nNational Invitation Tournament.\nThe blowout loss in the first game of the Big East tournament dashed the Hoyas′ hopes of playing their way into a 2019 NCAA tournament bid, and Georgetown missed the NCAA Tournament for a fourth straight season, the first time that had happened since a four-year drought from the 2001–2002 through 2004–2005 seasons. However, the Hoyas did receive an invitation to the 2019 National Invitation Tournament. It was their first NIT appearance since 2014, and their first postseason tournament appearance of any kind since they played in the 2015 NCAA tournament. The 2019 NIT used a number of experimental rules, including a three-point line set approximately farther from the basket to match the distance used by the International Basketball Federation (FIBA); a free-throw lane widened from , the width used in the National Basketball Association; a shot clock that reset to 20 seconds instead of 30 seconds after an offensive rebound; the elimination of one-and-one free throws; and team foul totals that reset to zero at the 10-minute mark of each half for the purpose of determining free throws, with teams shooting two bonus free throws after the fifth team foul of each 10-minute segment and awarded two bonus free throws after the second team foul committed under two minutes remaining in each half if that foul occurred before the fifth team foul of the segment, with team fouls resetting in each overtime period and teams shooting two free throws beginning with the fourth team foul or the second team foul committed under two minutes remaining if that came before the fourth team foul of the overtime period.\nSeeded third in one of the NIT's brackets, Georgetown faced Harvard, the No. 6 seed, in the first game. Harvard had qualified automatically for the NIT by winning the Ivy League regular-season championship and had missed an NCAA Tournament bid by losing to Yale in the championship game of the 2019 Ivy League tournament. The two schools had not met since December 2009. As the higher seed, Georgetown hosted the game, but with Capital One Arena booked to host a Washington Capitals National Hockey League game, the Hoyas met the Crimson at a packed McDonough Gymnasium in Georgetown's first on-campus game since November 2016. The crowd included United States Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, a Harvard Law School alumna.\nThe Hoyas appeared to put out a lax effort during the game, and Harvard led 13–6 after only four minutes of play. By halftime, the Crimson had outrebounded the Hoyas 21–14, although Georgetown led, 36–35. The Hoyas did not score for nearly nine minutes during the second half and trailed for most of the last 10 minutes of the game. With 38 seconds to play, however, Jessie Govan hit a three-pointer to bring the Hoyas within one point at 69–68. James Akinjo then fouled Harvard's leading scorer, junior guard Bryce Aiken, who sank both free throws to put Harvard ahead 71–68 with 14 seconds remaining. On Georgetown's next possession, Govan attempted another three-pointer with seven seconds left, but missed; Greg Malinowski grabbed the rebound but could not get another three-point attempt off before the buzzer ended both the game and Georgetown's season as Harvard won, 71–68.\nIn his final game as a Hoya, Govan had a game-high 25 points, while Akinjo contributed 15, and Mac McClung finished with 10, but four Harvard players also finished in double figures. Although Harvard committed 16 turnovers to Georgetown's eight, the Crimson outrebounded the Hoyas 39–30. Georgetown's record fell to 3–1 all-time against Harvard. After the game, Ewing said, \"I believe that we had a very good year. We won 15 games last year; we won 19 this year. Hopefully next year we’ll make a lot more, make the NCAAs, and go far. Right now it hurts. I’m disappointed. It’s a tough loss. Now we have to start going out to recruit and getting ready for next year. My seniors, I’d like to thank them for the hard work they’ve put in.”\nWrap-up.\nGeorgetown's season ended with two straight first-round tournament eliminations and an overall record of 19–14. For the fourth straight season, the Hoyas never made the Top 25 in either the Associated Press Poll or the Coaches Poll – the first time that had happened in four consecutive seasons since 1996-1997, 1997-1998, 1998-1999, and 1999-2000. They also missed the NCAA Tournament for a fourth straight season, the first time that had happened since 2001, 2002, 2003, and 2004. However, they achieved a number of things that they had not since the 2014–2015 season, namely a winning season, a non-losing Big East Conference record, and a post-season tournament appearance, although like the other eight Hoya teams that had made the post-season since Georgetown's 2007 Final Four appearance, they had failed to advance beyond the first or second round of the NCAA Tournament or NIT, losing in the NIT's first round. But they had avoided the late-season losing streak that had befallen the Georgetown teams of the previous three seasons and had even shown signs of growth in defeating two ranked teams late in the year. Picked preseason to finish seventh in the Big East, they had finished in a four-way tie for third, and their No. 6 seed in the Big East tournament – one slot higher than predicted preseason – gave them their first first-round bye in the tournament since 2015.\nFor the second straight year, Jessie Govan was the team's leading scorer; he started all 33 games, shooting 49.6 percent from the field overall and 41.2 percent in three-pointers, averaging 17.5 points and leading the team with 7.5 rebounds per game. James Akinjo played in all 33 games and started all but one of them, and he averaged 13.4 points and 2.9 rebounds per game, shooting 36.5 percent from the field overall and 39.1 percent from three-point range. Mac McClung played in 29 games, starting all of them, shooting 39.2 percent in field-goal attempts and 27.7 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 13.1 points and 2.6 rebounds per game. Josh LeBlanc appeared in all 33 games and started 22, shooting 63.0 percent from the field overall and 71.4 percent from beyond the arc, averaging 9.1 points and 7.3 rebounds per game. Trey Mourning started 11 of the 26 games he played in, and he averaged 6.3 points per game on 43.5 percent shooting from the field as well as 3.8 rebounds per game. Jamorko Pickett played in 31 games, starting 23 of them, shooting 38.3 percent in field-goal attempts and 35.6 percent from three-point range, and he averaged 6.2 points and 3.8 rebounds per game. Playing in his only season as a Hoya, Greg Malinowski appeared in all 33 games, starting six of them, and averaged 5.7 points per game on 44.4 percent shooting from the field overall and 38.7 percent on three-pointers, and he pulled down 3.2 rebounds per game. Jahvon Blair came off the bench to play in 31 games, averaging 4.3 points per game on 35.6 percent field-goal shooting overall and 34.4 percent from three-point range, and he had 1.3 rebounds per game. Kaleb Johnson started two of the 31 games he played in; he ended the season with a field-goal percentage of 59.3 – 50.0 from three-point range – and with per-game averages of 4.3 points and 2.9 rebounds. Jagan Moseley played in 32 games and had seven starts, and he finished with 3.1 points and 1.9 rebounds per game, shooting 46.3 percent from the field and 36.7 percent from beyond the arc. Grayson Carter came off the bench in the 14 games he played in, and he averaged 1.1 points per game on 27.8 percent shooting from the field – 33.3 percent in three-point attempts – and grabbed 1.0 rebound per game. Walk-ons George Muresan and Jaden Robinson each played in one game.\nJessie Govan, Greg Malinowski, Trey Mourning, and Kaleb Johnson all graduated in 2019. In his 128-game career, Govan started 90 games, shooting 50.1 percent overall from the field and 40.8 percent from three-point range and averaging 13.0 points and 6.6 rebounds per game, and he scored 1,664 points. In addition to his only year at Georgetown, Malinowski had played for three seasons at William and Mary, and he finished his four-season college career having played in 128 games, starting 36 of them, shooting 42.9 percent from the field and 39.0 percent from three-point range and averaging 6.3 points and 3.1 rebounds per game. Mourning completed his 62-game college career with 11 starts, a field goal percentage of 43.9 percent – 15.3 percent from beyond the arc – and 3.2 points and 2.0 rebounds per game. Kaleb Johnson played in 124 college games, starting 35 of them, scoring 4.3 points per game on 54.4 percent shooting from the field overall and 37.2 percent from three-point range and averaging 2.7 rebounds per game. The Class of 2019 was the first graduating class since the Class of 2005 to spend its entire four years at Georgetown without ever playing in an NCAA Tournament game, and only the second to do since the Class of 1974.\nAt the end of April, the news broke that after the conclusion of the academic year freshman forward Grayson Carter would transfer to UT Arlington in search of greater playing time. He finished his only season as a Hoya having appeared in 14 games, all off the bench, playing a total of 66 minutes, shooting 27.8 percent from the field and 33.3 percent from three-point range, and averaging one rebound and 1.1 points per game. Under NCAA transfer rules, he had to sit out the 2019–2020 season, but would be eligible to play for the Mavericks beginning in the 2020–2021 season.\nWith a young team and an all-freshman backcourt, the 2018–19 Hoyas played inconsistently, often following impressive performances against strong – even ranked – opponents with lackluster losses to lesser foes, and failed to achieve the late-season momentum necessary to make a push for an NCAA Tournament bid or a deep run in the Big East tournament or the NIT. In reviewing the season after the first-round NIT loss to Harvard, the Casual Hoya website wrote, \"For every rousing win, there was a deflating loss. For every meaningful stride by a freshman, there was a discouraging regression by a veteran. Seemingly every inspired, dogged performance was followed by a flat-footed one...the Hoyas...face questions, particularly related to coaching, where game preparation and defensive coherence too often were lacking.\" But the site broke the news the day before the Harvard loss that Jones County Junior College small forward Galen Alexander had decided to transfer to Georgetown with immediate eligibility the following season, and after the Harvard game described the season's freshman class as \"excellent,\" recruits for the following season as \"promising,\" and the program as \"trending in the right direction.\" Patrick Ewing viewed the season as another step forward in restoring Georgetown's men's basketball program to the national prominence and success it had once enjoyed, and said that he believed that 19 wins and an NIT appearance represented important progress. His goal for the following season was for Georgetown to the return to the NCAA Tournament.\nAttendance.\nGeorgetown averaged 7,212 fans per home game during the 2018–2019 season. It was a 30-year low for the Hoyas.\nRoster.\n\"Note: Antwan Walker was dismissed from the team in October 2018.\"\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=9 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9 style=| National Invitation Tournament"

The 49ers, led by twelfth-year head coach Dan Monson, competed in the Walter Pyramid. Long Beach State was a member of the Big West Conference, and participated in their 50th consecutive season in that league.\nBefore the season.\nThe 49ers finished the season 15–18 overall, and 9–7 in the conference. During the season, the 49ers participated in the AdvoCare Invitational, which was held in Morgantown, West Virginia and Lake Buena Vista, Florida. Long Beach State earned 6th place by defeating Oregon State and losing to Missouri as well as Nebraska. Prior to the tournament, Long Beach State lost in a friendly match at West Virginia. In the postseason, Long Beach State lost to Cal State Fullerton in the quarterfinals of the 2018 Big West Conference men's basketball tournament in Anaheim, California.\nWithin a few days of the elimination, Dan Monson accepted a five-year contract extension (through the 2022–23 school year) as a result of his past success at Long Beach State. Monson was rehired for multiple reasons, ranging from running the program primarily on sport ethics to his \"on the court\" results. To this season, Monson led the program to a Big West winning record each season since 2010–11 and participated in the NCAA tournament once.\nGreg Floyd Jr. was a four-star recruit who turned down twenty-four other NCAA Division I schools for Long Beach State on September 7, 2016. Floyd was the highest rated incoming 49er since Jacob Thomas and Shelton Boykin, who were both a part of the recruiting class of 2010. On April 9, 2018, the Los Angeles Ballers announced that Floyd was ineligible [through the NCAA] to compete at Long Beach State due to scholastic probation at his former school. As a result, Floyd is currently an athlete for the Ballers, and the NCAA withdrew his commitment.\nBy July 17, 2018, Long Beach State redesigned the court by emphasizing on the color black, removing \"The Beach\" motto for the main athletics logo, and installing darker wood. However, some of the former features of the previous court design still remain in a different fashion, such as the social media hashtags \"#GoBeach\" and \"#LBNation\".\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Big West regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"| Big West tournament"

The qualifying stage was to be a single match on 13 March 2022 between the two lowest-ranked participating OFC nations in the FIFA World Rankings, with the winner advancing to the group stage, but Tonga withdrew from the qualification match causing Cook Islands to automatically enter the group stage. Then eight remaining teams were drawn into two groups of four, playing single leg round-robin. The top two teams from each group advanced to a single leg knockout stage. The final winner advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nEntrants.\nOn 28 July 2020, the OFC confirmed that the qualifications would involve all eleven OFC teams. On 29 November 2021, the date of the group stage draw, FIFA reported that nine of the eleven FIFA-affiliated national teams from the OFC would enter qualification, as American Samoa and Samoa had withdrawn. On 29 January 2022, two months after the group stage draw but two months before the competition was to begin, Tonga also withdrew due to the 2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami. On 19 March 2022, Vanuatu withdrew after the tournament had started due to the majority of players testing positive for COVID-19. On 23 March 2022, Cook Islands also withdrew after the tournament had started due to players testing positive for COVID-19.\nSchedule.\nQualifying was initially expected to begin in September 2020, but many international matches scheduled for the FIFA window in that month were cancelled in June 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the inter-confederation play-offs were also moved from March to June 2022.\nIn November 2020, the OFC announced a further delay in the qualifying process until June 2021.\nIn March 2021, the confederation announced that this timeframe would not be achievable either, outlining a potential option organise a competition in January 2022, keeping the FIFA International Match Calendar dates in March available for preparation matches ahead of the inter-confederation play-off in June. Fiji and New Caledonia were proposed as possible venues.\nBy September 2021, continued delays meant that the OFC felt it was \"not possible at this time to organise a qualifying competition within the Oceania region\" and, as an alternative, they requested FIFA's approval for the qualification to be held in Qatar in March 2022. This was confirmed by FIFA on 29 November 2021.\nVenues.\nThe matches are played at two venues in the city of Doha.\nQualification match.\nA qualification match was due to be held between the two lowest-ranked teams (Tonga and the Cook Islands) to determine the eighth team to compete in the group stage.

The teams were divided into two groups, each containing four teams. Each team played every other team in their group once in a round-robin format, and the winners and runners-up of each group advanced to the semi-finals.\nDraw.\nThe group stage draw was held in Zürich, Switzerland on 29 November 2021, 21:00 CET (30 November, 09:00 NZDT). The identity of the qualification match winner was not known at the time of the draw. The draw began with pot 2 and finished with pot 1, with teams being allocated to the groups sequentially (firstly A, then B). The first two teams drawn were assigned to position 4, while the next two were assigned to position 3, and the first two from pot 1 to position 2. The two highest ranked teams, New Zealand and the Solomon Islands, were assigned to positions A1 and B1, and were therefore not drawn in the same group.\nThe draw resulted in the following groups:\nThe fixtures for the group stage were decided based on the draw results, as follows:\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n\"The result was eventually excluded from the group standings after the withdrawal of the Cook Islands.\"\n\"The match was cancelled due to a COVID-19 outbreak in the Vanuatu squad.

A total of 13 slots in the final tournament were available for UEFA teams.\nEntrants.\nAll 55 FIFA-affiliated national teams from UEFA entered qualification.\nStatus of Russia.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major international sporting events, after RUSADA was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators. However, the Russia national team could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the World Cup proper as a world championship. The WADA ruling allowed athletes who were not involved in doping or the coverup to compete, but prohibited the use of the Russian flag and anthem at major international sporting events. An appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport was filed, but WADA's decision was upheld though reduced to a two-year ban. The CAS ruling also allowed the name \"Russia\" to be displayed on uniforms if the words \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\" have equal prominence. If Russia had qualified for the tournament, its players would not have been able to use their country's name alone, flag or anthem at the World Cup, as a result of the nation's two-year ban from world championships and Olympic Games in all sports.\nOn 27 February 2022, after the threat of boycotts by the Czech Republic, Poland and Sweden amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIFA prohibited the Russia national football team from playing home matches in Russia; the team would have to play matches behind closed doors at neutral sites. In addition, the team would have been prohibited from competing under the name, flag, or national anthem of Russia, and had to compete under the name \"Football Union of Russia\" (RFU). On 28 February, however, following a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA suspended the participation of Russia. Poland were subsequently given a walkover for their play-off semi-final match scheduled against Russia. The Russian Football Union announced they would appeal the decision to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Their request for a temporary lift of the ban was rejected on 18 March.\nFormat.\nThe qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in Nyon, Switzerland, on 4 December 2019. The qualification would depend, in part, on results from the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League, although to a lesser degree than the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League had on qualification for UEFA Euro 2020. The structure maintained UEFA's usual 'group stage/playoff stage' structure, with only the specific format of the play-offs amended.\nOn 4 December 2019, the UEFA Executive Committee initially approved the use of the video assistant referee system for the qualifiers. However, VAR was not implemented at the start of qualification due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on operational and logistical capabilities. On 5 August 2021, UEFA announced that the VAR system would be used for the remainder of qualification, starting from September 2021.\nSchedule.\nBelow is the schedule of the European qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup.\nIn March 2020, UEFA announced that the two matchdays planned to take place in June 2021 would be moved following the rescheduling of UEFA Euro 2020 to June and July 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. To allow for the completion of the qualifying group stage in November 2021 as scheduled, UEFA announced on 24 September 2020 that the March and September 2021 windows in the FIFA International Match Calendar were expanded from two to three matchdays. The changes to the International Match Calendar for March and September 2021, which extended each window by one day, were approved by the FIFA Council on 4 December 2020.\nThe original schedule of the qualifying group stage, as planned before the pandemic, was as follows.\nFirst round.\nSeeding.\nThe draw for the first round (group stage) was held in Zürich, Switzerland, on 7 December 2020, 18:00 CET (). However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the draw occurred as a virtual event without any representatives of member associations present. It was originally planned to be held on 29 November 2020. On 18 June 2020, the UEFA Executive Committee approved the draw regulations for the qualifying group stage. The draw was presented by Spanish journalist Cristina Gullón and conducted by FIFA's acting director of competitions, Jaime Yarza. He was assisted by former footballers Daniele De Rossi and Rafael van der Vaart, who drew the balls from the pots.\nThe 55 teams were seeded into six pots based on the November 2020 FIFA World Rankings, after the conclusion of the league phase of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League. Pots 1 to 5 contained ten teams, while Pot 6 contained five teams. The teams were drawn into ten groups: five groups of five teams (Groups A–E) and five groups of six teams (Groups F–J). The draw started with Pot 1 and was completed with Pot 6, from where a team was drawn and assigned to the first available group in alphabetical order. Therefore, each six-team group contains one team from each of the six pots, while each five-team group contains one team from each of the first five pots.\nThe following restrictions were applied with computer assistance:\nTeams were allocated to seeding pots as follows (November 2020 FIFA Rankings shown in second column).\nGroups.\nThe fixture list was confirmed by UEFA on 8 December 2020, the day following the draw. Qatar were partnered with the five-team Group A, which enabled the 2022 FIFA World Cup hosts to play centralised friendlies against these countries on their \"spare\" match dates. However, these friendlies did not count in the qualifying group standings.\nSecond round.\nThe second round (play-offs) was contested by the ten group runners-up and the best two Nations League group winners, based on the Nations League overall ranking, who finished outside the top two of their qualifying group. They were separated into three play-off paths, with each path featuring two single-leg semi-finals and one single-leg final. The semi-finals were hosted by the six best-ranked runners-up of the qualifying group stage, while the host of the final was determined by a draw. The semi-finals were played on 24 March and 1 June, and the finals on 29 March and 5 June 2022. The winners of each path qualified for the World Cup.\nTeam selection and seeding.\nSecond-placed teams.\nThe ten runners-up from the first round advanced to the play-offs.

        "text": "The South American section of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification acted as qualifiers for the 2022 FIFA World Cup, to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL). A total of 4.5 slots (4 direct slots and 1 inter-confederation play-off slot) in the final tournament were available for CONMEBOL teams.\nThe qualification process began on 8 October 2020 and ended on 29 March 2022. Uruguay's Luis Suárez scored the first goal of the round-robin. This was the third time Suárez had opened scoring in the group (after 2010 and 2014), as well as the fourth consecutive time a Uruguayan player had done so (Martín Cáceres scored the first goal of the 2018 process).\nFormat.\nOn 24 January 2019, the CONMEBOL Council decided to maintain the same qualification structure used for the previous six tournaments. The ten teams play in a league of home-and-away round-robin matches.\nThe fixtures were determined by a draw which was held on 17 December 2019, 10:00 PYST (), at the Bourbon Asunción Convention Hotel in Luque, Paraguay.\nOriginally, Brazil and Argentina were both to be drawn into either position 4 or 5 in the draw, thus ensuring that no team has to play both of them on any double matchday. However, the decision was later reversed on 16 November 2019 by the CONMEBOL Council, making the draw completely open.\nThe CONMEBOL Council approved the use of the video assistant referee system for the qualifiers.\nEntrants.\nAll 10 national teams from CONMEBOL entered qualification.\nNote: Bolded teams qualified for the World Cup. \"Peru\" advanced to the inter-confederation play-offs.\nSchedule.\nThe qualifying matches are played on dates that fall within the FIFA International Match Calendar. There are a total of 18 matchdays. Originally eight matchdays would be in 2020 and ten would be in 2021.\nOn 12 March 2020, FIFA announced that matches on matchdays 1–2 due to take place in March 2020 were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the new dates to be confirmed.\nOn 25 June 2020, FIFA announced that the inter-confederation play-offs, originally scheduled to be played in March 2022, were moved to June 2022.\nOn 10 July 2020, FIFA announced that the CONMEBOL qualifiers in September 2020 were postponed, with the qualifiers starting in October 2020. CONMEBOL also requested FIFA to include a replacement international window in January 2022 in order to complete the qualifiers in March 2022. The proposal was approved by FIFA on 18 August 2020. On 6 March 2021, FIFA announced that the March 2021 matches (matchdays 5 and 6) were postponed due to travel and quarantine restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. These matches were rescheduled to be played in September and October 2021 after FIFA accepted the CONMEBOL's request to allow triple matchdays in both September and October international windows. Matchday 5 was played between matchdays 11 and 12, while matchday 6 was played between matchdays 9 and 10.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nMatchday 6.\nMatchday pushed back in revised schedule and then cancelled.\nMatchday 5.\nMatchday pushed back in revised schedule.\nInter-confederation play-off.\nThe inter-confederation play-off was determined by a draw held on 26 November 2021.

        "title": "Sand Hills Golf Club",
        "text": "Sand Hills Golf Club is a golf club in Mullen, Nebraska, United States. Notable for its remote location and minimalist design among the sandhills of Nebraska, it is consistently ranked among the top golf courses in the world and the best courses designed since 1960, notably being named #1 in \"Golfweek\" magazine's 2022 list of the \"Top 200 Modern Courses\", defined as courses built no earlier than 1960, in the United States. The golf course architecture website \"Golf Club Atlas\" called it \"the most natural course built in the United States since World War I\".\nCourse history and design.\nBecause of Nebraska's unique topography, course architects Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw moved only of earth when designing the course. Lincoln developer Dick Youngscap surveyed several thousand acres of land in 1990 and worked with Coore and Crenshaw to survey the land and find an ideal spot for the course. During two years of surveying the land, Coore and Crenshaw found over 130 \"natural golf holes\" on the property—defined as locations that had well-defined areas that could easily be converted into teeing areas, fairways, hazards, and greens. They spent much of that time narrowing the list of possible holes to 18 and determining an ideal course routing. At one point during the design phase, when Coore and Crenshaw were making little headway on a routing, Crenshaw stepped over a boundary fence and found a parcel of land that he saw as ideal, reporting back to Coore that he should see this particular parcel. Soon thereafter, Youngscap arranged a land swap with the owner of the adjacent parcel, which today contains the 12th through 15th holes. The course itself covers .\n$1.2 million was spent building the course, far less than other highly rated modern golf courses. One major source of savings came about when soil analysis found that the sand on the property had perfectly round grains—making it essentially identical to the \"USGA greens mix\", a special type of sandy soil that the United States Golf Association considers ideal for the needs of a golf green. At the time the course was being constructed, the average cost to build a green to USGA specifications was around $40,000, including not only the cost of the soil itself but also installing drainage systems. Because the ideal soil was already present, the greens required no drainage, making the cost to build all 18 greens less than $6,000. By itself, this reduced the course cost by over $700,000.\nRanking among the most exclusive courses in the United States, the club reportedly has fewer than 200 members from across the country, almost none of whom reside in 500-person Mullen. Most members fly into Denver, Omaha, or nearby North Platte when playing at the course and stay in the on-site accommodations that can host about 55 people.\nYoungscap's influence on Mike Keiser's development of Bandon Dunes Golf Resort is well documented."

Each event had 20 competitors qualify: 18 from qualifying, 1 from the host (Japan), and 1 from Tripartite Commission invitations.\nTimeline.\nThe European, African, Oceania and Asian Championships were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Asian Championship was later cancelled due to travel restrictions in Asian countries resulting from the pandemic.\nQualification.\nJapan, as the host, was guaranteed at least one place. Initially the rules were interpreted such that this spot would only be used if no Japanese athlete would manage to qualify through the other qualifying events.\nThe first qualifying opportunity was the Combined World Championship, where the top seven finishers earned one quota place. Since four Japanese climbers qualified during this event (two male, two female), the unused Host Country Place went to the next highest placed climber in the Combined World Championships who is not yet qualified and doesn't come from a country with 2 climbers already qualified.\nThe second opportunity, the Olympic Qualifying Event featured the next 22 ranked athletes in the World Cup standings who had not yet received an Olympic invitation; of these, the top six qualified for the Olympic Games.\nBetween February and May 2020 each continent was to host a Continental Combined Championship, with the best finisher who is not already qualified earning a quota spot. Only the Pan-American Championships was held before the coronavirus pandemic halted competition. In February 2020, to address potential cancellations of continental championships due to the pandemic, IFSC updated the qualification guidelines to read, \"Unused quota from any Continental Championship, will be reallocated to the next highest placed athlete from the relevant continent, not yet qualified, in the Combined World Championships 2019, respecting the maximum quota per gender per NOC.\"\nWith the IFSC Climbing Asian Championships cancelled, Jongwon Chon and Seo Chae-hyun, both of South Korea, are the qualifiers.\nThe Tripartite Commission invitation was to be allocated after the continental championships, but the deadline was missed, and places were awarded to the next highest qualified eligible finishers at 2019 World Championships.\nSelection.\nAfter athletes qualify, they are allocated a quota space by the International Federation of Sport Climbing (IFSC), which must be confirmed by their National Olympic Committee (NOC). In some cases the NOC might choose not to use a quota place in order to decide who fills the quota at a later date. During the Combined World Championships Japanese climbers Akiyo Noguchi, Miho Nonaka, Tomoa Narasaki and Kai Harada earned a quota place, but only Noguchi and Narasaki were subsequently confirmed to qualify for the Olympics. Later the IFSC and the Japan Mountaineering and Sport Climbing Association (JMSCA) confirmed both Nonaka and Harada as Olympic-qualified athletes.\nIn November 2019 the Japanese Mountaineering and Sport Climbing Association (JMSCA) opened a lawsuit against the IFSC related to uncertainties in the qualification system and how the 'host place' qualification could be used. Associated rule changes also affected selection pathways for athletes from other countries. However, the Court for Arbitration in Sport (CAS) dismissed the suit in December 2020."

As the Olympics was postponed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, qualification ends on 27 June 2021.\nQualifying standards.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter a maximum of two qualified athletes in each individual event, but only if both athletes have attained the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT). One athlete per event can potentially enter if they meet the Olympic Selection Time (OST) or if the quota of 878 athletes has not been targeted. NOCs may also permit swimmers regardless of time (one per gender) under a Universality place, since they have no swimmers reaching either of the standard entry times (OQT/OST).\nIn the relay events, a maximum of 16 qualifying teams in each relay event must be permitted to accumulate a total of 112 relay teams; each NOC may enter only one team. The first twelve teams in each relay event at the 2019 World Championships will automatically compete for the relay events at the Olympics; while the remaining four per relay event must obtain their fastest entry times based on the FINA World Rankings during the process.\nBecause of the exceptional circumstances related to COVID-19 crisis, the consequent Olympic delay, and the unprecedented two-year gap between the Worlds and the new date of the Games, FINA revised the universality rule that allowed a nation to enter the highest-ranked male and female swimmer, respectively, based upon the Points Table (2021 edition). Swimmers from NOCs, having achieved the OST allocated to the universality place, may be entered to a maximum of two individual events, whereas those without the OQT and OST were limited to enter in one individual event only.\nFollowing the end of the qualification period, FINA will assess the number of athletes having achieved the OQT, the number of relay-only swimmers, and the number of Universality places, before inviting athletes with OST to fulfill the total quota of 878. Additionally, OST places will be distributed by event according to the position of the FINA World Rankings during the qualifying deadline.\nThe qualifying time standards must be obtained in World Championships, Continental Championships, Continental Qualification Events, National Championships and Trials, or International Competitions approved by FINA in the period between 1 March 2019 to 27 June 2021.\nThe initial FINA qualifying standards, still to be ratified, are as follows:\nIndividual events.\nThose who have achieved the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT) or the Olympic Selection Time (OST), or have been guaranteed a Universality place are listed below for each of the following individual events.\nRelay events.\n16 teams qualify in each relay event, for a total of 112 relay teams.\nTeams can qualify by one of two routes:"

The competition at these Games will comprise a total of 104 athletes coming from their respective NOCs; each has been allowed to enter a maximum of eight if qualified in the women's team and two if qualified only for the women's duet. NOCs qualified in the team event may select two of the team members to compete in the duet. Host nation Japan is considered the Asian continental representative, having reserved a spot on all events.\nFor the team competitions, the best ranked NOC in each of the five continental championships, with the exception of the host country Japan which will represent the Asian continent, obtains a secured place for the Games, while the remaining NOCs will compete for the two highest-ranked spots at the 2019 World Aquatics Championships and the three highest-ranked spots at the Olympic Qualification Tournament. For the duet, the best ranked NOC in each of the five continental championships that do not have a qualified team assures a secured spot, while the other seven top-ranked NOCs will be selected through Olympic Qualification Tournament. All 10 NOCs that have already qualified in the team event each automatically qualify two synchronized swimmers (who must be members of the team) to form a duet."

Because the FIH was the international federation affiliated to the International Olympic Committee, it supervised the Olympic tournament.\nThe FIH and IFWHA agreed that qualification for the Olympics would be decided by a joint FIH–IFWHA committee based on the results over the previous two years, including the 1978 (FIH) and 1979 (IFWHA) women's world championships.\nFive teams qualified to join the host Soviet team: the Netherlands, West Germany, the United States, New Zealand, and Great Britain (taking the place of Wales, England, and Scotland, who had finished 5th, 6th, and 7th respectively in the 1979 tournament).\nHowever, all five of these teams boycotted to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The United States and West Germany boycotted completely, and while New Zealand, Great Britain and the Netherlands competed in other sports, their hockey governing bodies pulled out.\nThis threw the tournament into chaos. Subsequently, the organising committee sent out invitations to other countries, though Ireland declined their invitation."

He played in his school rugby with Newbridge College. Although he played fly-half at school, he moved to inside centre with the Leinster academy. His strengths in attack include a good kicking game, footwork, and passing, while in defence despite his lack of size he has a physical approach.\nInternational career.\nWith the Irish sevens team he generally played at centre, but also filled in at fly-half. O'Brien played for Ireland at the 2018 Hong Kong Sevens qualifier, scoring four tries, but Ireland lost to Japan 7–12 in the semifinal and consequently failed to qualify as a core team for the 2018-19 World Series. O'Brien played for Ireland on the London and Paris legs of the 2017-18 World Rugby Sevens Series; in those tournaments, despite its non-core status, Ireland surprised by finishing third and seventh respectively, with O'Brien scoring four tries across the two tournaments.\nIn February 2022 O'Brien was called up to the Ireland squad for the 2022 Six Nations Championship.\nIn June 2022, he was included in the Ireland squad for the 2022 tour of New Zealand.\nOn 4 November 2022, he was called up as a late bench replacement to the named squad to face South Africa in the first test of the Autumn Series, following an injury to Robbie Henshaw whose starting place was taken by replacement Stuart McCloskey. Following an injury to McCloskey in the first half, O'Brien made his test debut, playing 53 minutes in an Ireland victory."

Three matches were played against English county sides as part of the tour, with 50-over matches played against Kent and Northants, and a Twenty20 match played against Leicestershire.\nIn addition to the provisional World Cup squad, Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan were named in England's squads for this series and the preceding ODI against Ireland, and were in contention for a place in the World Cup side depending on their performances.

Shoaib Malik missed Pakistan's first two matches against England due to a personal issue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed that he was available for selection for the second ODI match. Mohammad Hafeez was also unavailable for the one-off T20I and the first two ODIs, after injuring his hand.\nSam Billings was ruled out of England's T20I squad after he dislocated his shoulder, and was replaced by Ben Foakes. Alex Hales was dropped from England's squads, following a 21-day ban for using recreational drugs and was replaced by James Vince. Jason Roy and Mark Wood were also withdrawn from the T20I squad prior to the series and were replaced by Ben Duckett and Dawid Malan.

The tournament would consist of four legs, the first being in the Pacific-Asia Zone, the second in the European Zone, the third in the Americas Zone, and a Grand Final in Beijing. In January 2018, the World Curling Federation announced the name of the tournament would be changed to the Curling World Cup, and consist of men's, women's, and mixed doubles events.\nOn July 19, 2018, details about the Curling World Cup were announced, including the host cities, format, qualification rules, and logos for each leg of the event.\nOn June 17, 2019, it was announced by the World Curling Federation that the series would not be renewed because Kingdomway Sports breached their agreement with the WCF by refusing to make all their payments as outlined in their contract.\nFormat.\nCurling World Cup matches had eight ends, rather than the standard ten ends. Ties after eight ends were decided by a shoot-out, with each team throwing a stone and the one closest to the button winning. A win in eight or fewer ends earned a team 3 points, a shoot-out win 2 points, a shoot-out loss 1 point, and 0 points for a loss in eight or fewer ends."

England won the one-off ODI match by four wickets.\nIn addition to the provisional World Cup squad, Jofra Archer and Chris Jordan were named in England's squads for this match and the subsequent series against Pakistan, and were in contention for a place in the World Cup side depending on their performances. England finalised their fifteen-man World Cup squad following the conclusion of the matches against Pakistan.\nSquads.\nAfter the England squad was announced, Sam Billings suffered a dislocated shoulder which ruled him out of the match. He was replaced by Ben Foakes. Alex Hales was dropped from England's squad, following a 21-day ban for using recreational drugs. Jason Roy and Mark Wood were also withdrawn prior to the match and were replaced by Ben Duckett and Dawid Malan. The day before the match, Mark Adair was added to Ireland's squad, replacing Stuart Thompson, who was ruled out due to injury."

When a boycott of the stronger nations became obvious, the almost 100% chance of recapturing Olympic gold appeared on the horizon for the host nation.\nHowever, to get a team medal, there needed to be more than just a Soviet team in Moscow. As the countries belonging to the political west-block boycotted the Games, the Soviet Union had to stimulate countries from the east-block to take part. Those countries had some international dressage riders, but few really at the Olympic, Grand Prix-level. In the end, Bulgaria, Romania and Poland travelled to Moscow to guarantee a team competition. All this logistic maneuvering to guarantee a nations' ranking led to the fact that Poland, for instance, only found out they were allowed to compete with a team two days before departure.\nIn Moscow in the end there was a team class, there were three team medals awarded, but to speak of Olympic level is hard when looking at the results these brave riders and horses got from the highly experienced chief judge Gustaf Nyblaeus and his four colleagues. The judges' panel was challenged in its own way with more horses not able to show certain movements than they would have cared for.\nThe Soviet Union won their coveted team gold in the impressive Bitza stadium about 50 km outside Moscow with more than 800 points ahead of Bulgaria and Romania more than 230 points behind the silver medalists.\nCompetition format.\nThe team medals were awarded after the Grand-Prix portion of the individual competition. After the Grand-Prix portion of the individual event the three rides of each team were added up and the highest score was the winner, all three scores counted towards the final. Both the team and the individual competitions ran concurrently."

        "text": "The 2018–19 Curling World Cup was the first edition of the Curling World Cup, held between men's, women's, and mixed doubles teams. It had three legs and a Grand Final, taking place in Suzhou, China, Omaha, United States, Jönköping, Sweden, and Beijing, China respectively.\nFormat.\nCurling World Cup matches have eight ends, rather than the standard ten ends. Ties after eight ends are decided by a shoot-out, with each team throwing a stone and the one closest to the button winning. A win in eight or fewer ends earns a team 3 points, a shoot-out win 2 points, a shoot-out loss 1 point, and 0 points for a loss in eight or fewer ends.\nEach event has eight teams in the men's, women's, and mixed doubles tournament. The teams are split into two groups of four, based on the Curling World Cup rankings, whereby the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th, ranked teams are in one group and the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th ranked teams in the other. The first place teams in each group plays against each other in the final. In the event of a tie for first place, a shoot-out is used, with the same format used to decide matches tied after eight ends.\nQualification.\nFor the first three legs of the Curling World Cup, the eight spots in the tournament are allocated to each of the hosting member associations, the highest ranked member association in each zone (the Americas, European, and Pacific-Asia), and two teams chosen by the World Curling Federation. Member associations may choose to send the same teams to all three legs or have different teams.\nThe following countries qualified for each discipline:\nThe host (China), the winners of each leg, the current world champions, a team specifically invited, and the two highest remaining member associations on the Curling World Cup ranking list qualified for the Grand Final. Two separate teams from the same member association may qualify for the Grand Final.\nThe following countries qualified for each discipline:\nRanking points.\nRanking points were assigned in each of the first three legs to determine the final member associations qualified for the Grand Final. Member associations were awarded their points from round robin play as well as 5 points for the runner-up and 10 for the champion.\nFirst leg.\nWomen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, September 17, 12:00\"\nMen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, September 17, 16:00\"\nMixed doubles.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, September 16, 08:30\"\nSecond leg.\nWomen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, December 9, 12:00\"\nMen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, December 9, 16:00\"\nMixed doubles.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, December 9, 08:30\"\nThird leg.\nWomen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, February 3, 16:00\"\nMen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, February 3, 12:00\"\nMixed doubles.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, February 3, 08:30\"\nGrand Final.\nWomen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, May 12, 16:00\"\nMen.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, May 12, 09:00\"\nMixed doubles.\nFinal.\n\"Sunday, May 12, 13:00\""

They were qualified for the Summer Olympics by winning the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Belgrade. The team was coached by Aleksandar Đorđević, with assistant coaches Miroslav Nikolić, Milan Minić, and Jovica Antonić.\nRoster.\nThe following were candidates to make the team:\nExhibition games.\nThe Serbia roster has participated at the Super 4 in Córdoba, Argentina (July 29 – August 1), together with Argentina, Croatia and France.\nOlympic play.\nKnockout round.\nQuarterfinal – Croatia.\nThere was little to separate the two teams in the first half, with Serbia up 20-19 at the end of the opening period and Croatia taking a 38-32 advantage at the break. Serbia took control thanks to a third quarter in which they outscored Croatia 34-14. They took their biggest lead of the night, 66-52, when Bogdan Bogdanović buried a three-pointer with 22 seconds left in the period. Croatia answered by going on a 22-7 run that got them within 74-73 on Darko Planinić's pair of free-throws with 3:26 remaining. Serbia stayed in front but Croatia were breathing down their neck. Sasha Đorđević's side got a bit of breathing room when Miroslav Raduljica made the second of two foul shots to make it 79-75 with 27 seconds and that forced Croatia in having to foul intentionally to stop the clock but ultimately running out of time.\nSemifinal – Australia.\nSerbia were in control of the game right from the start, scoring the opening eight points and forcing Australia into bad shots and costly turnovers. It didn't help that the Boomers were ice cold, going 2-of-15 from the field, as they trailed 16-5 by the end of the first quarter. It was more of the same in the second period as Australia continued to struggle to find the bottom of the net while Serbia tightened their grip on the game by closing out the first half on a 9-0 run for a commanding 35-14 lead. Australia broke out of their slump in the third quarter, scoring 24 points but Serbia had 31 of their own as they headed into the final frame up 66-38, with the win all but wrapped up. Miloš Teodosić was in attack mode right from the get go, scoring 6 of Serbia's first 12 points. It gave Serbia the start they needed and they never looked back. Teodosić finished with 22 points and 5 assists."

        "text": "The 1883 Southern Rugby Union season was the 10th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. Twelve clubs competed from May till August 1883. The season culminated in the Premiership, which was won by Redfern. This was the first premiership in which the winner was awarded the Gardiner Cup. Redfern were crowned Premiers at a committee meeting of the Union.\nTeams.\nBy the beginning of the season, the Southern Rugby Football Union had 37 clubs signed up as part of the Union. Out of these, 24 resided within the Sydney area with 6 representing a school or college. This left 18 clubs based within Sydney, independent of any school. Some of these clubs were considered to be \"Senior\" Clubs with the others called \"Junior\" Clubs.\nIt is not clear whether all clubs were eligible for the Premiership or a select group were. According to the Sydney Club Rugby discussion board on the Green and Gold Rugby website, 12 clubs competed for the Premiership. However, in the Australian Town and Country Journal, they state that these were only the principal clubs. This indicates that more clubs were considered when deciding upon the Premier Club. The Paddington Club was included in the list in the Australian Town and Country Journal, but was not included as a member club of the Union. They may have signed on at a later date.\nRule Changes.\nThe rules were changed at the beginning of the season determining who was the victor in a match. Previously, games were decided by the number of goals scored irrespective of tries scored. The new system involved awarding points to tries and goals with the winner of the match being the team with the greatest number of points. As a result of this change, it was noticed that game tactics had changed with players working towards tries rather than goals. Some lamented this and suggested that the system be improved to encourage more kicking.\nSeason Summary.\nThe 1883 SRFU Sydney Rugby Premiership was the first season to award the Premiers with the Gardiner Cup. This was a trophy sponsored by Mr W Gardiner for a football competition known as a 'challenge cup'. Unfortunately, the Union found it difficult to organise such a competition due to the lack of suitable playing fields and the disorganisation of club engagements. One of the biggest problems with matches was the encroachment of spectators onto the playing field. This would result in games being suspended. Police intervention was sought after to ensure games could continue uninterrupted. At the beginning of the season, the Union was able to arrange for a section of the grounds at Moore Park in the control of the Agricultural Society of NSW to be used for football matches.\nThe organisation for the Gardiner Cup was still unsettled by 14 June. At a meeting of the Southern Rugby Football Union, a suggestion was made to award the Cup to the Premiers of the season, as decided by the committee of the Union.\nPremiers for 1883 were the Redfern Football Club. The first fifteen were undefeated for the season with only 11 points scored against them. Matches included games played against Junior teams. Their second game against Sydney University resulted in their opponents unable to form a team to play against them. President of the club was the Hon. Edmund Barton.\nAt the time, the Premiership was decided by a committee of the Union. It was not clear how the Union decided upon the Premier club. When the season had concluded, it was suggested that the relative positions of the clubs should not be left up to the allotment of the Union. It was suggested that a set of rules be arranged at the beginning of the season to determine the champion and what was needed to obtain the premiership.\nRepresentative Games.\nIntercolonial Matches.\nAfter the success of the previous season's games, a New South Wales team was sent to Brisbane to compete against a Queensland team in two intercolonial matches. This was the first time that a representative team had been sent by the Southern Rugby Football Union. The first match saw a thrilling game with Queensland snatching the win 12 points to 11. Pratten ran the entire length of the field to score the winning try. At the conclusion of the game, the enthusiastic Queensland crowd carried Pratten from the field. The second match saw New South Wales win the game 13 points to nil surprising the Queensland crowd. The NSW forwards displayed superior power with the team showing superb passing."

        "title": "StarCraft II in esports",
        "text": "Professional \"StarCraft II\" competition features professional gamers competing in Blizzard Entertainment's real-time strategy game \"StarCraft II\". Professional play began following the game's initial release in 2010, as the game was the sequel to \"StarCraft\", considered one of the first esports and the foundation of South Korea's interest and success in competitive gaming. Between 2016 and 2019, competition was centered around the Global StarCraft II League in Korea and the World Championship Series Circuit everywhere else, with all Blizzard-sanctioned events being under the StarCraft II World Championship Series (WCS) banner. Since 2020, Blizzard changed the format of WCS by entering into a three-year partnership with esports organizers ESL and DreamHack.\nHistory.\nPre-release expectations.\nPrior to \"StarCraft II\"s release, \"\" had been called the most successful esport, featuring its own ranking system, and it had been referred to as the national pastime in South Korea, where there were two television channels dedicated to broadcasting professional \"StarCraft\" matches. The series' history with professional competition had brought about the creation of the Korean e-Sports Association (KeSPA) and the professional team league it administered, StarCraft Proleague. As such, the original was considered the founding esport of the country's successful infrastructure and scene. This led to high expectations for the sequel's success as an esport, but also a conflict between KeSPA and Blizzard Entertainment, sparking a three-year long legal battle between them. This meant KeSPA would not be transitioning to \"StarCraft II\" upon its release.\nThe first large \"StarCraft II\" tournaments occurred during the beta testing phase in the months prior to release, the most notable being the HDH Invitational and esports player Sean \"Day[9]\" Plott's King of the Beta. The success of both viewership and sponsorship of these early events cemented high expectations for professional play of the title going into its July 2010 release.\nEarly success.\nFollowing its launch, \"StarCraft II\" quickly turned into a successful esport, becoming the main feature of many leagues and circuits of ongoing tournaments with some of the largest prize pools in professional gaming. Among these, the first large professional events for the game were organized by Major League Gaming and Intel Extreme Masters in the months following the game's release, with IEM Season V - Global Challenge Cologne and 2010 MLG Pro Circuit Raleigh. Soon after, the game's first professional league was formed in Korea, the Global StarCraft II League (GSL) organized by GOMTV. The game also became a primary fixture of Dreamhack starting with a November showing in 2010 and Assembly that same year. The title's early popularity led to the creation of multiple \"StarCraft II\"-only competitions outside of Korea as well, with the return of \"StarCraft\" mainstay TeamLiquid's own event, the Team Liquid StarCraft League (TSL), and the creation of the North American Star League (NASL).\nBlizzard and GOMTV signed an agreement on 26 May 2010, allowing the latter to create and broadcast the GSL starting with a series of three open tournaments, each with a US$170,000 prize pool, in South Korea. This agreement followed the decision from Blizzard to cease negotiations with KeSPA, and it confirmed that Blizzard had decided to work with a different partner to promote \"StarCraft II\" as an esport in South Korea. The non-profit public interest group Public Knowledge made the following statement regarding the issue: \"The Battle.net Terms of Use state that it is a violation of the agreement—and an infringement of Blizzard's copyright in the underlying game—to \"use the Service for any 'e-sports' or group competition sponsored, promoted or facilitated by any commercial or non-profit entity without Blizzard's prior written consent.\" Following the GSL's transition into a regular league format in 2011 with two tiers of play, Code S and Code A, the first professional Korean team league for \"StarCraft II\" was started by GOMTV, the Global StarCraft II Team League (GSTL). Alongside it, the e-Sports Federation (eSF) was founded to represent the teams participating in the team league.\nKeSPA transition and peak.\nLate 2011 and 2012 constituted the peak of \"StarCraft II\" as the largest esport in the world, with the transition of KeSPA and associated tournaments StarCraft Proleague (SPL) and Ongamenet Starleague (OSL) to StarCraft II. 2012 saw the founding of the Blizzard-sanctioned and organized World Championship Series (WCS). \"StarCraft II\" remained the most viewed, sponsored, and active esport in the world and, for the first time since its release, clearly took over \"StarCraft\"s position in South Korea as all professional teams and both leagues transitioned to it.\nYears after negotiations had ended, Blizzard and KeSPA once again renewed conversation which resulted in KeSPA receiving a license from Blizzard in 2012 and Ongamenet announcing \"StarCraft II\" competitions starting in the summer of 2012. This brought them into direct competition with the GSL and GSTL and led to a team league split which had eSF teams playing in GSTL and KeSPA teams playing in SPL. The WCS featured over 30 LAN events and culminated in the largest \"StarCraft II\" event until then in China as part of the Battle.net World Championship Series Global Finals.\nDecline and end of Proleague.\nStarting with the release of \"Heart of the Swarm\" in early 2013, the WCS transitioned into a league format as Blizzard strengthened its hold on professional \"StarCraft II\" competition with the introduction of WCS points that decided who would qualify for the year's biggest tournament, the WCS Global Finals. This led to fewer non-WCS events yearly as 2014 marked Major League Gaming's last \"StarCraft II\" event, the second large blow to the North American scene following the last NASL event in late 2012. Non-Korean competition quickly became focused almost exclusively on WCS events, unlike the largely decentralized competitive circuits of the years prior.\nIn Korea with the peak of the eSF and KeSPA rivalry, KeSPA came out on top for team competition as the GSTL ended its second season of 2013 and its last. Teams that remained from the eSF after the end of GSTL transitioned to Proleague through the 2014 and 2015 seasons. However, the KeSPA-backed individual league OSL folded in 2013 following its second overall \"StarCraft II\" season and its only one that year. The only individual league that remained for 2014 was the GSL. Throughout the following years the GSL was joined by the StarCraft II StarLeague (SSL), while Proleague folded following its first and only \"Legacy of the Void\" season in 2016 following a matchfixing scandal that saw one of the game's most successful players, Lee \"Life\" Seung-Hyun, permanently banned from competing. The end of team competition in Korea marked the low point of the game's scene in the country and was accompanied by a resurgence in interest in \"\" professional competition.\nResurgence.\nIn late 2017 the \"StarCraft II\" Warchest was introduced, featuring cosmetic rewards and an unlocking system to accompany them. For each purchase 25% of sales went to funding \"StarCraft II\" esports, and the funding target for BlizzCon 2017, a crowdfunding of $200,000, was reached within the first of three stages of the crowdfunding. The rest of the funds gained went into funding other events throughout the following months and year. New War Chests were released for both the IEM World Championship 2018, raising the prize pool by the targeted $150,000 within the first stage again, and BlizzCon 2018, raising the prize pool by the targeted $200,000 within the first stage once more.\nDuring BlizzCon 2017, Blizzard Entertainment announced that \"StarCraft II\" would become free-to-play starting 14 November 2017. This included the \"Wings of Liberty\" campaign, full \"Legacy of the Void\" multiplayer and co-op access, and the custom games section called the Arcade, for everyone. This led to a resurgence in interest and player base as \"StarCraft II\" viewership surged in 2018, with many events showing great improvements, some over double their 2017 viewership. This included the GSL vs. the World 2018 tournament, the first GSL event to be won by a non-Korean, Finnish player Joona \"Serral\" Sotala. It became the highest-viewed Korean tournament outside of Korea for \"StarCraft II\". Television network viewership has not been available for domestic comparison.\n\"StarCraft II\" also saw growth and recognition as an international competitive sport, as it was featured at an exhibition tournament prior to the 2018 Winter Olympics at the Intel-sponsored IEM PyeongChang, which was won by Canada's Sasha \"Scarlett\" Hostyn, and the game was also featured as part of the 2018 Asian Games esports exhibition, an event won by South Korea's Cho \"Maru\" Seong-ju.\nChange to ESL/DreamHack.\nSince 2020, Blizzard partnered with esports organizers ESL and DreamHack for a period of three years, where tournament qualification format would change to weekly cups, and the global finals would no longer be held at BlizzCon, rather the Intel Extreme Masters event would serve that purpose. This new system is denominated ESL Pro Tour.\nInternational competition.\nAsian Games.\n\"Starcraft II\" was part of an electronic sports demonstration event during the Asian Games 2018 held in Indonesia. Eight countries participated after qualifying from their respective regions with Indonesia automatically qualifying as host.\nAsian Indoor and Martial Arts Games.\n\"Starcraft II\" has been part of the electronic sports event at the Asian Indoor and Martial Arts Games since 2013. The 2017 event in Turkmenistan was boycotted by some countries including the previous winner South Korea. Electronic sports in the 2017 event were also no longer recognized as an official sport and became a demonstration sport instead, to accompany electronic sports' status at the Asian Games."

        "title": "Uganda men's national lacrosse team",
        "text": "The Uganda men's national lacrosse team, also known as the Lacrosse Cranes, represents Uganda in international lacrosse competitions and is governed by the Uganda Lacrosse Association (ULA), which is a full member of World Lacrosse, the international governing body for lacrosse. ULA is also fully recognized by the Uganda National Council of Sports (NCS), as well as the Uganda Olympic Committee (UOC).\nHistory.\nLacrosse's roots in Uganda can be traced to the sport's introduction in 2009 by Fields of Growth International, a U.S.-based non-profit organization founded in May 2009 by Kevin Dugan, the University of Notre Dame's director of men's lacrosse operations.\nIn Uganda, Dungan sought to intersect sports with community development and after attending an academic seminar at Makerere University Business School (MUBS), where he met Maurice Sserunkuma, a faculty member there, with Sserunkuma's insistency, they made lacrosse part of the MUBS sports program, and Dugan built a lacrosse compound in Kampala, Uganda, and established a volunteer corps that brought American stars like Rob Pannell, Tom Schreiber, Chad Wiedmaier, Ryan Flanagan and John Christmas to Uganda, not only to teach lacrosse, but also to help construct the Hopeful School in Khindu, Masaka.\nWell over 100 Americans participated in the volunteer corps missions which include farming, landscaping, brick making, digging and village outreach. Sserunkuma went on to become the founding Secretary General of what at the time was called the Uganda Lacrosse Union (ULU), Sam Otoa was the Deputy Secretary General, and Francis Eriwala was in charge of Public Relations, while Jaffari Ibrahim Makanda, a MUBS student was charged with recruiting athletes. With the strong support of the late Tom Hayes, World Lacrosse Director of Development at the time, ULA first became an associate member of World Lacrosse in 2011, as its 40th member overall, and Dugan received the World Lacrosse Development Award in September 2015.\nIn June 2011, Tyler Steinhardt, a Baltimore-area native, traveled to Uganda as part of a group of 20 Americans volunteer corps. Steinhardt, who had played lacrosse throughout his life, was known in the lacrosse world for coordinating Shootout for Soldiers, the 24-hour, record-breaking lacrosse game that raised $120,000 to support wounded American troops as part of the Wounded Warrior Project.\nSteinhardt ended up making two more trips to Uganda, helping ULU develop and continue to grow lacrosse in the area through the introduction of a national championship tournament known as the King's Cup. Since that time, the ULU established three distinct seasons: a traditional spring season with a league championship, a summer developmental training season that culminates in a national tournament and a fall seven-on-seven season. He was named the 2011 Ugandan National Lacrosse Coach of the Year.\nIn November 2020, World Lacrosse officially recognized ULA, by unanimous vote of the board, as its first full member national governing body from the continent of Africa, and ULA was a founding member of the Africa Association of Lacrosse, formed in 2020 and formalized as a continental federation of World Lacrosse in 2022.\nAs a full member, the ULA will have a voting delegate eligible to participate in the annual WL general assembly, and in addition, national teams representing Uganda will be eligible to advance to the championship bracket and win medals in all WL championship events.\nOn March 2, 2023, World Lacrosse added five African countries to its membership, bringing the total number of African countries to eleven; the growth of lacrosse in Africa is seen as a vital step for the sport to be included in the 2018 World Olympics.\nWorld Lacrosse Championships.\n2014 World Lacrosse Championship.\nIn September 2013, Andrew Boston, an Ellicott City, MD native, was named the head coach of the Uganda men's senior national lacrosse team, with a strong supporting cast of assistants in Tom Schreiber (offensive coordinator), Tanner Scales (defensive coordinator), and Casey Lavallee.\nIn July, Steinhardt was named the general manager of the team, but the hard work had just begun, and even getting to the United States was a challenge, as defection was a real concern especially after more than 12 African athletes went missing after the 2012 Olympics in London. Political maneuvering by U.S. Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger, a former player at the University of Maryland helped, as relations between the U.S. and Uganda over an anti-gay law signed by the president of Uganda in earlier in the year in February added complexity to the proceedings.\nA fundraiser, the Dream 2014 Campaign, launched by former Louisville lacrosse player Aimee Dixon, now the director of philanthropy at World Lacrosse, raised about $150,000 to pay for travel expenses for the team and coaching staff, with his players' visas not secured until days before the team was scheduled to fly to Denver, Colorado.\nThe team made their international debut at the World Lacrosse Championship in 2014, played in Denver, Colorado, United States as the first African team to feature in the tournament. In 2011, Castro David Onen, who begun playing lacrosse in 2010 scored the first goal in the first lacrosse game to ever be played on African soil, and on July 11, 2014, in Uganda's very first game of the tournament, he scored the first ever goal for an African team in the World Lacrosse Championship, in a 17–1 loss to Ireland, as he ran by two Ireland defenders and put the ball in the back of the net in the third quarter of the team's international debut.\nThree days later, Uganda erased a five-goal deficit, scoring the final six goals with 6:17 left, in a game against the Republic of Korea to earn its first-ever world championship win. Patrick 'Pato' Oriana, the captain, scored the game-winning goal off a faceoff with 36 seconds left to lift Uganda to a 10–9, in a dramatic, storybook, spectacular fashion, coming from behind after trailing 9–4, and scoring twice in the final 44 seconds.\nThey ended the tournament ranked finished 34th among 38th competitors, coming away with two wins over Korea and Argentina over the seven games they played, and gaining global attention - featuring on the cover of the September 2014 edition of USA Lacrosse Magazine, a publication of US Lacrosse, the sport's governing body in the United States.\nThe Lacrosse Cranes' journey to the 2014 championship was the subject of a documentary called \"Kandote\" (a Ugandan word meaning \"let me dream\"), a film by former Johns Hopkins University lacrosse player Will McCance.\nFour players from this team eventually played in the Israel Premier Lacrosse League; Patrick Oriana and Castro David Onen for Barak Netanya Lacrosse Club, then Jaffari Ibrahim Makanda and Kenneth Kasule for Askelon Lacrosse Club.\n2018 World Lacrosse Championship.\nIn May 2017, Matt Holman, a Summit, New Jersey native, was named general manager of the Uganda men's national senior lacrosse team.

The coefficient is calculated by dividing the total of points accumulated by the number of participating teams.\nParticipation is reserved to teams from associations that have an effective capacity to organise annually their own national championships. They will all have at least one team entering the competition. To allocate the other nine places, the D'Hondt method was applied to the coefficient of each association.

        "text": "Six national teams qualified to compete in baseball at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo . As host, Japan automatically qualified. Israel also qualified, by winning the Africa/Europe Qualifying Event in September 2019.\nIn addition, two teams qualified through the November 2019 WBSC Premier12 tournament. Mexico qualified as the best team from the Americas, and South Korea qualified as the best team from Asia or Oceania (other than already-qualified Japan). The United States qualified by winning the Americas Qualifying Event in early June 2021.\nThe last spot was awarded to the Dominican Republic, for winning the Final Qualifying Tournament in late June 2021.\nTimeline.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;section begin=Timeline /&gt;\n1 The WBSC Premier12 was played in Japan, Mexico, South Korea, and Taiwan, with the final in Tokyo.&lt;section end=Timeline/&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAfrica/Europe Qualifying Event.\nIsrael qualified for the Olympics by winning the two-continent qualifying tournament for Europe and Africa. The tournament was a round robin. It was held in Parma and Bologna, Italy, from 18 to 22 September 2019. It featured six teams: the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Israel, and the Czech Republic (the top five teams in the 2019 European Baseball Championship), and South Africa (the winner of the 2019 African Baseball Championship).\nPetr Čech of the Czech Republic led the tournament in batting average (.500), and Danny Valencia of Israel led in runs (7), home runs (3), RBIs (9), walks (5), and slugging percentage (1.000). Pitchers Orlando Yntema of the Netherlands and Joey Wagman of Israel tied for the lead with two wins, and Wagman led in complete games (1) and strikeouts (14).\nAs the winner of the tournament, Israel qualified to compete in the Tokyo Olympics. The second-place team in the event, the Netherlands, received another qualification opportunity in the Final Qualifying Tournament.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;section begin=EU_AF /&gt;&lt;section end=EU_AF /&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\n1 game postponed 4–4 in 6th inning; continued 20 September.\n2019 Premier12.\nThe top 12 teams on the WBSC men's baseball ranking list at the end of 2018 qualified for the November 2019 Premier12 competition. Teams from the Americas, Asia, and Oceania were able to qualify for the 2020 Olympics through this tournament. Mexico earned a quota spot as the top finisher from the Americas, and South Korea earned a spot as the top finisher from Asia or Oceania (excluding the already qualified host, Japan).\nAmericas Qualifying Event.\nThe United States won the eight-team Americas Qualifying Event, and was thereby awarded the one quota spot allocated to the winner of the tournament. The teams that finished in second and third place in the event, the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, progressed to the Final Qualifying Tournament.\nAll six American teams that had competed in the 2019 Premier12 but did not qualify for the Olympics in that tournament received a place at this Qualifying Event. In addition, the event included the top two finishers at the 2019 Pan American Games that did not qualify for the 2019 Premier12. The event was originally scheduled to be held from 22 to 26 March 2020, in Arizona, but was postponed to 31 May through 5 June in Port St. Lucie and West Palm Beach, Florida, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCanada, the Dominican Republic, the US, and Venezuela advanced to the four-team Super Round. Canada came in fourth, and was thus eliminated from possible Olympic qualification.\nJeison Guzman of the Dominican Republic led the tournament in batting average (.571), Julio Rodríguez of the DR led in runs (7), José Bautista of the DR led in walks (6), and Juan Francisco of the DR led in home runs (4) and RBIs (9).\nFinal qualifying tournament.\nThe Dominican Republic, as the winner of the Final Qualifying Tournament in late June 2021 in Mexico, earned the final qualification spot for the 2020 Olympics. Three teams took part. Six teams were originally scheduled to take part: the runner-up from the Africa/Europe Qualifying Event, the runner-up and third-place team from the Americas Qualifying Event, the top two finishers from the 2019 Asian Baseball Championship that had not already qualified for the Olympics, and Australia (which was chosen to represent the Oceania region).\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held from 1 to 5 April 2020 in Taichung and Douliu, Taiwan. It was initially postponed to 17 to 21 June, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following the decision to postpone the 2020 Olympic Games to 2021 due to the pandemic, the WBSC again postponed the tournament, this time to from 16 to 20 June 2021 in Taiwan. In May 2021, due to a spike in domestically transmitted COVID-19 cases in Taiwan and new restrictions imposed by the local government, the WBSC moved the final qualifier to 22 to 26 June 2021, in the city of Puebla, Mexico.\nOn 7 May 2021, the WBSC announced that China had withdrawn from the competition. Chinese Taipei also withdrew on 2 June 2021, due to concerns related to player safety from COVID-19 in Mexico, leaving four teams and no Asian representation at the tournament. On 8 June 2021, Australia withdrew from the tournament due to logistical issues caused by COVID-19, leaving just three teams to compete."

        "title": "Swimming (Mac Miller album)",
        "text": "Swimming is the fifth studio album by American rapper Mac Miller. It was released on August 3, 2018 by REMember Music and Warner Bros. Records. Miller produced the album himself, with Jon Brion, Dev Hynes, J. Cole, ID Labs, Dâm-Funk, DJ Dahi, Tae Beast, Flying Lotus, and Cardo, among others. The album has no credited features, but contains vocal contributions from Dâm-Funk, Dev Hynes, Snoop Dogg, Syd, Thundercat, and JID. Miller died on September 7, 2018, making \"Swimming\" his final album to be released during his lifetime.\n\"Swimming\" was supported by three singles: \"Small Worlds\", \"Self Care\", and \"What's the Use?\". The album received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number three on the US \"Billboard\" 200. It was nominated for Best Rap Album at the 2019 Grammy Awards.\nBackground.\nMac Miller began work on \"Swimming\" in 2016. He announced the album through social media on July 12, 2018, alongside its release date.\nMusic and lyrics.\nThroughout the album, Miller's break up with pop singer Ariana Grande is a common theme of inspiration, as it gave him the chance to experience self-love, healing and psychological growth, similar to the themes shown in his previous album, \"The Divine Feminine\" (2016). Lyrically, \"The Independent\" stated Miller addresses the acknowledgment of his temper (\"Wings\") and the pitfalls of fame (\"Small Worlds\").\nConcerning the album's music, \"Rolling Stone\" noted \"Swimming\" is \"a continuation of 2016's \"The Divine Feminine\", with a silky, deep vibe redolent of the L.A. alternative soul scene\". The song \"So It Goes\" has been said to incorporate \"muted guitars and a spacey synth drone\", while \"Wings\" has been described as \"a spacious neo soul slow burner punctuated by the occasional sigh of a violin\". \"NME\" wrote that \"Ladders\" is \"a buoyant radio ready bop, which sees his bars skitter across glorious brass lines and earworm riffs\". \"Jet Fuel\" was described as \"sluggish, dancehall-inflected trip hop\", and \"What's the Use\" as \"synth-funk\".\nRelease and promotion.\n\"Swimming\" was released worldwide by Warner Bros. Records on August 3, 2018, amongst other high-profiled albums, such as \"Astroworld\" by Travis Scott and \"Stay Dangerous\" by YG. Miller performed \"Ladders\" on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" on August 13, 2018.\nMiller announced The Swimming Tour on July 23, 2018, with Thundercat and JID as his opening acts. The tour was scheduled to have 26 shows across North America, beginning in San Francisco on October 27, 2018, and concluding in Vancouver on December 10, 2018. It was cancelled following Miller's death on September 7, 2018.\nSingles.\nOn May 30, 2018, Miller released the album's first single \"Small Worlds\", alongside two non-album singles: \"Buttons\" and \"Programs\". The album's second single, \"Self Care\", was released with an accompanying music video on July 13, 2018. The album's third single, \"What's the Use?\", was released on July 23, 2018.\nCritical reception.\n\"Swimming\" was met with generally positive reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from professional publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 13 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave it 7.5 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.\nMeaghan Garvey of \"The Guardian\" described \"Swimming\" as \"a patient record in sound and concept\" and \"an ambling 13-song journey towards self-acceptance, one that does not end in triumph\". Colin McGowan of \"The A.V. Club\" complimented the album's production and vocal delivery: \"Miller sounds great when he's whining, croaking, stretching syllables like warm mozzarella. \"Swimming\"s spare, dreamy production allows him to do a lot of that.\" Evan Rytlewski of \"Pitchfork\" concluded: \"An album with nothing but time on its hands and an understanding that healing is a slow, tedious process, \"Swimming\" is most engaging when it details the simple things Miller tells himself to keep his spirits up.\" Kyle Mullin from \"Exclaim!\" enjoyed the album, saying, \"Whether Miller is singing on those funk-inflected highlights, or rapping on them with a flow that's airtight to their irresistible rhythms, he sounds like a would-be chart-topper, not to mention one of the most versatile and accomplished hip-hop artists working today\". For \"NME\", Hannah Mylrea concluded: \"\"Swimming\" isn't what you would have expected from Miller when he first started dropping mixtapes over a decade ago, but that doesn't matter. This album shows his growth as both an artist, and as a person who's had to deal with the most private aspects of their life being publicly dissected. It's a stellar – if somewhat overlong – artistic statement.\"\nMosi Reeves of \"Rolling Stone\" wrote that \"Swimming\" is Miller's \"most impactful album of his career\", though noted a lack of lyrical depth: \"If he could surface those demons with more vivid details and add texture to his lyrics instead of simply using them as a rhythmic device, then he may have a genuinely classic album in him yet. But if \"Swimming\" doesn't quite achieve greatness, it connects. You can hear his pain and perseverance, even if he struggles to put it into words.\" Neil Z. Yeung of AllMusic concluded that \"\"Swimming\" is ample evidence that Miller can pick up the pieces and continue evolving, his grasp on thoughtful, introspective hip-hop getting stronger by the album\". Trey Alston of \"Highsnobiety\" concluded that \"Swimming\" is \"the authentic self-destruction album so many artists have attempted before. Here, Mac is in rare form, chronicling his destruction and rebirth in a way that shows his acknowledgment of the path ahead, but reluctance to step on it without the certainty of companionship at the end. Whether he continues to walk that path is ultimately up to him, but the Mac that's featured on \"Swimming\" will find his way from the darkness. In the process, he's given us a beautiful means to mark the turn of his narrative\".\nCommercial performance.\nIn Miller's home country of the United States, \"Swimming\" debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 66,000 album-equivalent units, which included 30,000 pure album sales in its first week. It serves as Miller's fifth consecutive top-five album in the United States.\nFollowing Miller's death on September 7, 2018, the album rose from number 71 to number six on the \"Billboard\" 200 with 67,000 album-equivalent units, of which 15,000 were in traditional album sales. Additionally, three tracks from the album entered the US \"Billboard\" Hot 100: \"Self Care\" (number 33), \"Hurt Feelings\" (number 70), and \"Come Back to Earth\" (number 91). \"Self Care\" became Miller's highest-charting song as a lead artist and second-highest entry overall, behind Ariana Grande's \"The Way\" featuring Miller (2013; number 9). On February 24, 2021, \"Swimming\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for combined sales and album-equivalent units of over 1,000,000 units in the United States. It is Miller's first ever album to be certified as platinum.\nIn Australia, \"Swimming\" opened at number 21 on the ARIA Albums Chart, becoming Miller's third top-50 album in the country. In Canada, \"Swimming\" debuted at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart. It serves as Miller's fifth consecutive top-10 album in the country. In the United Kingdom, the album debuted at number 37 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the rapper's first top-40 album on the chart.\nTrack listing.\nNotes\nSamples\nPersonnel.\nCredits adapted from the album's liner notes.\nMusicians\nTechnical"

The host nation, Japan, automatically qualified a team in each discipline.\nTimeline.\nThe following is a timeline of the qualification events for the equestrian events at the 2020 Summer Olympics."

        "title": "Fencing at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification",
        "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for fencing at the 2020 Summer Olympics . Qualification was primarily based on the Fédération Internationale d'Escrime (FIE) Official Ranking, with further individual places available at four zonal qualifying tournaments.\nFor the team events, 8 teams qualified in each event. Each team must be composed of 3 fencers, with a fourth alternate. The top 4 ranked teams qualified. The next-best ranked team from each zone (Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Oceania) also qualified as long as it was ranked in the top 16. If a zone did not have any team ranked between fifth and sixteenth, the best-placed nation not already qualified was selected regardless of zone.\nFor individual events the 3 fencers from the team event qualified for individual competition automatically. 6 more places were awarded based on the rankings (ignoring fencers from countries with team qualifications, and considering only the top fencer from each country): the top 2 fencers from each of Europe and Asia-Oceania, and the top 1 fencer from Africa and the Americas. 4 more places (1 per zone) were awarded through zone qualifying tournaments; only countries without a qualified fencer in an event were eligible to participate in these zone qualifying tournaments.\nThe host country was entitled to 8 quota spots for individual fencers, in addition to those qualified in the above mechanism, respecting the maximum quota of athletes per country (3 per weapon). If enough of these spots will be used to bring to 3 the number of participants in an individual event, the host country will also take part in the corresponding team event, bringing the number of teams to 9. Unused host country spots, should there be any, were to be awarded to other countries through the FIE universality quota and the Tripartite Commission.\nFrench fencer Daniel Jérent initially qualified to fence in the individual and team épée events, but was banned from participating due to a positive urine test for a banned product. Jérent was replaced by Romain Cannone, who competed in the two events in which Jérent was entered, and Ronan Gustin was recalled as a team replacement. Cannone later went on to win the individual event.\nAmerican Alen Hadzic initially qualified to fence in team épée on Team USA as a replacement athlete. But he was suspended due to sexual misconduct from competing by the United States Center for SafeSport; he then had his suspension reduced to a lesser sanction by an arbitrator. Ultimately, Hadzic was permanently banned from fencing by SafeSport for his sexual misconduct."

        "title": "Philippines–Australia basketball brawl",
        "text": "The Philippines–Australia basketball brawl occurred between players of the Philippine and Australian men's national basketball teams during a match held on 2 July 2018 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan, Philippines. The match was part of the International Basketball Federation's (FIBA) 2019 Basketball World Cup Asian qualification process.\nThe brawl during the third quarter caused a delay of more than thirty minutes, resulting in the ejection of four Australian players and nine Filipino players. The game was resumed briefly before two of the three remaining Filipino players intentionally fouled out, meaning the Philippines lost by default.\nFIBA imposed sanctions on both sides. Suspensions were given to ten Filipino players (for a maximum of six games) and three Australian players (maximum of five games), along with the Philippines' head coach and assistant coach; both national federations were fined. The three referees who officiated at the match were suspended for a year. \nDespite the brawl, both Australia and the Philippines advanced to the second round of the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers. The Philippine national team was ordered to play their next home match in the second round of the qualifiers behind closed doors, with the succeeding two home games being placed under probation. The brawl also played a part in their withdrawal from the 2018 Asian Games, a decision that was later reversed. Both teams managed to qualify for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China.\nBackground.\nRoad to 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nFor the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, members of International Basketball Federation's (FIBA) Asia and Oceania confederations participated in one qualification process. For the first round of the joint Asia and Oceania qualifiers, the Philippines and Australia were drawn part of Group B along with Chinese Taipei and Japan.\nThe Philippines and Australia first played against each other in the qualifiers in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. The home side, Australia won over the visitors 84–68. Prior to the start of their second face off, this time in Bocaue, Bulacan, Philippines, the two teams had already qualified for the second round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers.\nThe last FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifier match of the Philippines prior to their second match-up against Australia was against Chinese Taipei, away from home. They won the game by 22 points. The Philippines decided to retain ten players from the Chinese Taipei game for their next match, replacing Jio Jalalon and Allein Maliksi with Baser Amer and Carl Bryan Cruz. Australia suffered a 78–79 defeat to Japan prior to their second Philippines game but decided to retain the twelve players in their roster.\nClosed door practice.\nTensions were already running high between the Australia and Philippine teams prior to the start of the game. During their closed-door practice on 1 July 2018, the Australia team removed the decals of corporate sponsors PLDT and Chooks-to-Go on the court, reportedly due to player safety issues. Officials from the Philippine national basketball association, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP), criticized the move, stating that the Australians should have asked permission. Philippine head coach Chot Reyes said that the Australians removed the decals for being slippery and added that the decals were approved to use by FIBA, mentioning that SBP and FIBA officials were at the venue. Reyes, along with SBP official Manny V. Pangilinan, posted a video of the act through Twitter, expressing displeasure at the move and promising that they would \"not back down\" from the Australians.\nAustralia apologized for the incident and the SBP accepted the apology. However, the SBP maintained that the actions of the Australian side were unacceptable. The decals were restored two hours prior to tip-off.\nPre-game confrontations.\nDuring the pre-game warm-ups, Philippine players began crowding onto the Australian half of the court. Calvin Abueva, a member of the Philippine team, attempted to trip Australian player Daniel Kickert, who countered back by pushing and shoving another member of the Philippine team who he assumed was the culprit. A short confrontation between the two teams resulted thereafter, which had to be defused by the referees before the start of the match. Abueva admitted to trying to trip Kickert, but insisted that the Australians had been 'bullying' them even before he did so.\nMatch details.\nThe Australians dominated the match, outscoring the Philippines in all three quarters played. The host was competitive against the visitors in the first quarter until Australia gained a 9-point lead by second quarter. The Philippines never recovered as Australia later achieved a double-digit lead against the hosts. Chris Goulding led the Australians in the scoring by contributing 20 points, while Andray Blatche led the Philippines with 12 points.\nThe three referees who officiated the match were Ahmed Al Bulushi of Oman, Hatim Alharbi of Saudi Arabia, and Paul Skayem of Lebanon. Jordanian official Fadi Adnan As’Ad Sabbah was the FIBA game commissioner.\nBrawl.\nThe Philippines was trailing 48–79 when the brawl began during the third quarter, with four minutes and one second left to play. Filipino player Roger Pogoy hit Australian player Chris Goulding with two hard fouls, one away from the play. Kickert, Goulding's teammate, retaliated by giving a similar hard foul to Pogoy with his elbow and forearm. Kickert's response caused Blatche and Jayson Castro to rush to retaliate. Other Filipino players from the bench rushed onto the court to join the brawl.\nBlatche attempted to throw a punch against Kickert but was stopped by Australian player Thon Maker, who in turn was hit from behind by Filipino player Terrence Romeo. Team officials and spectators also got involved in the brawl. A separate incident involved Nathan Sobey, who was punched in the face by Jio Jalalon, a Filipino player who was not on the roster. Peter Aguilar, the father of Japeth Aguilar, threw a chair at Sobey.\nAt one point, Filipino players, officials and fans sitting at the court-side rushed in to hurt Goulding, who was lying on the floor defending himself. Philippine assistant coach Jong Uichico was seen punching and dropping a chair on Goulding. Filipino player Troy Rike came to Goulding's defence and stood over him to protect him from further attacks. Australian assistant coach Luc Longley intervened to clear away the people attacking Goulding and Sobey. Allein Maliksi, another Filipino player not part of the roster like Jalalon, also took part in the brawl.\nMarc Pingris was criticized for taking a group selfie of himself and the rest of the Philippine team on-court after the brawl.\nMatch resumption and call off.\nThe brawl caused a thirty-minute stoppage of the match. The referees along with security officials left the court and went to the OB Van of ESPN 5 outside the arena, which was covering the match, to review footage of the brawl from different camera angles. They returned to the court to announce sanctions.\nMatch officials ruled that thirteen players would be ejected before play was resumed. Officials ejected four Australian players and nine Filipino players, leaving the Philippine team with only three players. The match was resumed despite this, since FIBA rules state that play should continue as long as both teams have more than one player. June Mar Fajardo and Gabe Norwood, two of the three remaining Filipino players, intentionally fouled out, leaving Baser Amer as the last Filipino player on the court. The game was prematurely ended with one minute and fifty-seven seconds remaining in the third quarter.\nAftermath.\nThe Philippines lost by default due to a lack of eligible players because of the ejection of nine of its players and two of the three remaining players intentionally fouling out. The Philippines ended its first round campaign with four wins and two defeats, both against Australia, settling for second place in Group B while Australia lost only one of its six games topping the group. Both teams advanced to the second round of the qualifiers.\nFearing for their own safety, the Australia team remained in the Philippine Arena for several hours after the match and changed hotels. A scheduled press conference at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Pasig scheduled for 3 July 2018 was cancelled.\nReactions.\nOfficial statements by involved parties.\nBasketball Australia apologized for the brawl, accepting the Australia team's role in the incident but expressing concern for the involvement of officials and fans in the fight. The SBP apologized to Filipino fans and to the international basketball community for the brawl, saying that the incident \"breached the bounds of traditional Filipino hospitality\" and asserting that \"violence has no place in sports\". Both federations later issued a joint statement apologizing for the brawl and admitting full responsibility for the incident.\nOther reactions.\nAustralia's National Basketball League (NBL) said while the Australia team should accept consequences regarding the brawl, they also condemned players, officials, and fans of the Philippine team, stating what happened to the Australian side following the brawl was unacceptable. The SBP invited players of the Philippine team for a closed-door meeting scheduled on 5 July 2018 to discuss the incident, which could possibly impose its own fines and suspensions to players who were involved in the brawl.\nPingris' group selfie was criticized as insensitive by head coach Chot Reyes. Quinito Henson said that, based on how they knew Pingris personally, the selfie was an attempt to defuse tension. Reyes said that he would have stopped Pingris from taking the selfie given the circumstances.\nAccording to Australia head coach Andrej Lemanis, the brawl may cause the U.S. National Basketball Association (NBA), which was already reluctant to release its players for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, to hesitate even more about releasing its players for international play short of the FIBA Basketball World Cup or the 2020 Summer Olympics.\nFurther allegations.\nClosed-door practice sabotage.\nAfter the brawl-marred game, Australia's coach Andrej Lemanis accused the Philippines of sabotaging his side's training the day before the match. He stated that when the Australian team went to the training venue, one of the courts in the venue had a rim that was \"obviously too high\" and when officials came to measure the rim it was too high by . Lemanis then alleged that the people helping them in the court disappeared from the venue. He added that it was then that it became evident to his team that the court was unsafe to play on because of the way the decals were installed while reiterating Australia's early acknowledgement of not following the \"correct process\" in removing the decals. Lemanis said they decided to remove the decals due to time constraints caused by their limited practice time.\nRacism.\nAlleged incidents of racism were raised after the brawl. Winston Baltasar, a Filipino freelance photographer covering the event, alleged that Australian players had used racial slurs against Filipinos during an interview at \"The Ticket\", a radio program of Australia's Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). He said that Filipino players had been called \"monkeys\". The Australian Basketballers' Association and Basketball Australia issued a joint statement calling Baltasar's remarks as \"unsubstantiated and highly defamatory\" and expressed disappointment with the ABC's decision to publish material relating to the remark. In an earlier interview on \"SportsCenter Philippines\", Reyes said that he hadn't heard any incident of racist abuse by the Australian players.\nInvestigation.\nFIBA opened disciplinary proceedings against both Australia and the Philippines following the brawl. The referee of the match submitted statements and presented evidence to FIBA regarding the match and the brawl and both the basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines were given video copies recording the incident. Both Basketball Australia and the SBP were asked by FIBA to submit their own positions stating their sides regarding the brawl by 10 July 2018 but the deadline was later extended to midnight of 13 July 2018 (GMT+6).\nSanctions.\nPrior to the imposition of sanctions by FIBA, Al Panlilio of Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) expressed hope that FIBA would view the incident as an isolated case and not affect the hosting rights of the Philippines for the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He also expected that both federations of Australia and the Philippines would be fined and that it would be a surprise if FIBA would choose to impose indefinite suspensions of the respective basketball federations of Australia and the Philippines. He pointed to the incident between Serbia and Greece in 2010 as a precedent for his expectation.\nOn 19 July, FIBA handed down their decision after conducting disciplinary investigation. Ten players from the Philippine basketball team, its coach Chot Reyes, and assistant coach Jong Uichico, as well as three players from Australia were given suspension from playing future games in the qualifiers (six games maximum). Reyes was suspended for a single match while Uichico was suspended for three games. According to the SBP, FIBA was clear that the ban imposed on the Philippine players does not apply to the national team's planned participation in the 2018 Asian Games in Indonesia, as well as their participation with their respective teams in the Philippine Basketball Association, and that the match suspensions were to be served in the 2019 FIBA World Cup qualifiers.\nThe Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas was fined CHF 250,000 for \"unsportsmanlike behavior of its delegation members and of its public, as well as for insufficient organisation of the game\" while Basketball Australia was fined CHF 100,000 for removing the court decals prior to the match. The fines will be used to fund FIBA's \"Basketball for Good\" program.\nThe Philippines played their next home court match behind closed doors (against Qatar on 17 September, at the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City, with media coverage), while a ban for two more home games as the country have been placed under a probationary period of three years. However, Samahang Basketball ng Pilipinas executive director Sonny Barrios stated if the behind-closed-doors game went well, the homecourt game ban can be possibly lifted and will be open for fans. The country's co-hosting of the 2023 FIBA World Cup is not affected by the sanctions.\nThe three referees who officiated the brawl-marred match also faced immediate removal from the FIBA Elite Program and suspension from officiating international competitions sanctioned or organized by FIBA for 1 year.\nImpact.\n2019 FIBA World Cup qualification.\nBoth the Philippines and Australia managed to qualify for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup in China. The Philippines was forced to revamp its roster for the September 2018 qualification window and Yeng Guiao was appointed as their head coach. The Philippines lost two matches at home in the November 2018 window to Iran and Kazakhstan threatening their bid to qualify for the World Cup. However they managed to secure qualification after winning their two matches away from home in the February 2019 window against Qatar and Kazakhstan. The Philippines qualified as the best fourth placer in the Asian qualifiers and had to rely on South Korea winning over Lebanon in the same qualification window.\nPhilippines' Asian Games participation.\nThe brawl played a part in the Philippines' withdrawal from the basketball competition of the 2018 Asian Games. Before the brawl incident, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas (SBP) planned to send a national team composed of the core of the TNT KaTropa of the Philippine Basketball Association. However such plan was cancelled after several players of the ball club along with naturalized player Andray Blatche got involved in the brawl. Though the player suspensions has no bearing in the Asian Games since the sanctions will be served in the next round of the FIBA Basketball World Cup qualifiers, the SBP decided not to include any of players suspended due to the brawl in the Philippines' Asian Games roster.\nA plan was devised to send a national team composed of the core of the Rain or Shine Elasto Painters instead of TNT with NLEX Road Warriors coach Yeng Guiao to mentor the team. The Philippine Basketball Association officially announced the participation of Rain or Shine in the Asian Games on 26 July 2018 with the SBP declaring on the same day that the Philippine national team's withdrawal from the continental games saying that it and the national team intends \"regroup, prepare for the process of appealing the FIBA Disciplinary Panel's recent decision, and aim for sustainable success in future tournaments.\"\nThe decision to withdraw was reversed on 5 August 2018 due to \"clamor from fans\".\n2019 FIBA World Cup performance and further years.\nFor the Philippines national team, the brawl became the start of a downward spiral. The Filipinos finished last at 32nd place during the World Cup in China, missing their chance of qualifying for the 2020 Summer Olympics, extending their Olympic basketball drought to 48 years. As a result, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas has chartered a new direction for the team leading up to their hosting of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup and also in hopes of qualification to the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, which involves the development and international exposure of young players.\nAustralia went on to clinch the fourth-place spot at the World Cup. The Boomers also managed to qualify for the Olympics as the best Oceania team, where they won the bronze medal after defeating Slovenia.\nAustralia also went on to win back-to-back FIBA Asia Cup titles at the 2022 edition of the tournament and the Philippines played at the Philippine Arena for the first time since the incident during the sixth window of the FIBA Basketball World Cup 2023 Asian Qualifiers, winning against Lebanon, 107–96, on 24 February 2023, and faced Jordan in a losing effort, 90–91, at the same venue on 27 February."

        "text": "The 2020 Tour de France was the 107th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling's three Grand Tours. Originally scheduled to start on 27 June 2020, it was postponed until 29 August 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in France. The race began in Nice on 29 August and concluded with its traditional run on the Champs-Élysées on 20 September. A total of 176 riders from 22 teams participated in the race. The overall general classification was won for the first time by a Slovenian, Tadej Pogačar of . His fellow countryman Primož Roglič () finished second, while Australian Richie Porte () came third.\nAlexander Kristoff won the bunch sprint on stage 1 to take the first yellow jersey of the tour. Julian Alaphilippe, who led much of the previous year's tour, took the lead of the race after winning stage 2. Alaphilippe received a 20-second penalty for receiving food too close to the finish on stage 5 and lost his lead to Adam Yates. Yates held the lead for four stages before losing significant time in the mountainous stage 9, handing the lead to Roglič. Roglič held the yellow jersey for 11 stages, but was overtaken during the penultimate stage 20 time trial by Pogačar. With only the traditional procession on the Champs-Élysées remaining, Pogačar held his lead on the final stage.\nThe points classification was won by 's Sam Bennett, marking the first time that Peter Sagan had not won the points classification in a Tour he finished. The mountains classification and the young rider classification were both won by Pogačar, making him the first rider to win the yellow, polka dot, and white jerseys in the same year. Pogačar is the first rider to win three distinctive jerseys since Eddy Merckx in 1972, the first rider since Laurent Fignon in 1983 to win the Tour in his debut, and the first rider since Cadel Evans in 2011 to win the yellow jersey on the penultimate stage of the race.\n won the team classification for the third consecutive year. Marc Hirschi of was named the overall most combative rider. Pogačar won the most stages, with three.\nPostponement.\nThe 2020 Tour was in jeopardy of being cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic resulting in a virtual Tour being held using Zwift. On 14 April 2020 the International Cycling Union (UCI) announced the start of the 2020 Tour would be postponed until 29 August 2020, with the Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a España to follow in October.\nTeams.\nThe 2020 Tour de France peloton consisted of 22 teams. All nineteen UCI WorldTeams were entitled, and obliged, to enter the race. Additionally, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organisers of the Tour, invited three second-tier UCI ProTeams to participate in the event. The teams were announced on 7 January 2020. With every team fielding eight riders, 176 riders started the race in Nice. As 30 riders abandoned during the race, 146 riders made it to the finish line on the Champs-Élysées in Paris.\nTeams that participated:\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI ProTeams\nPre-race favourites.\nPre-race predictions in the media, as well as by the bookmakers, on the general classification, changed with the postponement of the Tour. 's Egan Bernal, the defending champion, sought to win a second consecutive title. Bernal's teammates, Geraint Thomas, who won in 2018, as well as four-time Tour winner Chris Froome, both did not participate after sub-par showings in the Critérium du Dauphiné. Thibaut Pinot (), who was among the top contenders the previous year but had to abandon due to injury, was another top contender. 's duo of Primož Roglič, winner of the 2019 Vuelta a España, and Tom Dumoulin were also seen as top contenders, as was their teammate Steven Kruijswijk, who finished third the previous year, but had to withdraw from this year's race following an injury sustained in the Critérium du Dauphiné a few weeks prior to the Tour's start. Other riders considered as top contenders included: Miguel Ángel López (), Romain Bardet, Emanuel Buchmann (), who finished fourth in the previous year's Tour, Mikel Landa (), Guillaume Martin (), Daniel Martínez (winner of the Critérium du Dauphiné), Nairo Quintana (), Tadej Pogačar (), who finished third in the 2019 Vuelta a España, Richie Porte and Bauke Mollema (). One of many outside contenders was Julian Alaphilippe, who wore the yellow jersey for 14 days the previous year and managed to finish fifth, but the Frenchman confirmed that his focus would be on winning stages and not targeting the general classification.\nFor the points classification, the big favorite was Slovakian Peter Sagan of , who holds the record for the most wins of the points classification with seven. Some of the other favorites included Sam Bennett (); Giacomo Nizzolo (), who won the Italian National Road Race Championships and the European Road Race Championships in the build-up to the Tour; Caleb Ewan (), who won three stages the previous year; and Wout van Aert (), winner of the 2020 Strade Bianche and 2020 Milan–San Remo. Other contenders are: Elia Viviani (), Alexander Kristoff (), Sonny Colbrelli (), and Matteo Trentin ().\nAmong the contenders for the mountains classification were the past three winners: 2017 winner Warren Barguil (), 2018 winner Julian Alaphilippe, and 2019 winner Romain Bardet (). Other notable top contenders included: Pierre Latour (); Pierre Rolland (); Ilnur Zakarin and Alessandro De Marchi (), Guillaume Martin and Nicolas Edet (); Dan Martin (); Thomas De Gendt and Tim Wellens (); Adam Yates (); Tiesj Benoot (), Lilian Calmejane (); and Davide Formolo and David de la Cruz ().\nThe two main favorites for the young rider classification were defending champion Egan Bernal and Tour debutant Tadej Pogačar. Bernal's teammate Pavel Sivakov, as well as Colombian duo Sergio Higuita and Daniel Martínez (), and David Gaudu () were also expected to do well in this classification.\nTwo teams were considered the front-runners for the teams classification; were led by defending champion Bernal and Carapaz; they previously won this classification in 2017. were led by Roglič and Dumoulin, as well as and . , which has won the teams classification in four of the last five Tours, were also expected to challenge for the classification despite losing several of their general classification leaders to other teams.\nRoute and stages.\nThe start of the 2020 Tour (known as the \"Grand Départ\") took place in Nice. This was the second occasion that the city has held the \"Grand Départ\", the first being for the 1981 Tour de France. This was the 36th occasion on which the Tour de France has visited Nice, and the first time since the 2013 Tour de France. This year's race took place entirely within France.\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" and the first week.\nThe first three stages of the Tour would begin in Nice, France, in late August due to the worldwide pandemic. Stage one was intended to be a flat sprinter's stage around the city, and began as expected with a three rider breakaway. The break was caught early in the stage, after racing for the King of the Mountains points were split equally, with the jersey won by Fabien Grellier for getting there first. With 100 km to go, an unseasonable driving rainstorm moved in causing the roads to become treacherous throughout the remainder of the day. Despite the peloton calling a truce in the interest of safety, Miguel Ángel López, John Degenkolb, Philippe Gilbert, Caleb Ewan, Rafael Valls, Julian Alaphilippe, George Bennett and many other riders were involved in crashes, causing several of them to abandon.\nWith 3 km to go there was a large pileup along the Promenade des Anglais in downtown Nice. The race jury decided anyone involved in this crash would receive the same time as the winner. Alexander Kristoff was involved in this crash, but because the sprinters' teams and leadout trains were not operating at top speed, as they would under normal conditions, he was able to make his way back to the front and beat the defending World Champion Mads Pedersen, as well as Bol, Bennett, Sagan and Viviani to win the stage and take the yellow jersey.\nStage two saw better weather, as well as two Category 1 climbs. The previous stage, Gilbert fractured a kneecap and Valls broke his leg, and neither started the stage. Attacks began early with Cosnefroy, Asgreen, Skujiņš, Gogl, Trentin, Sagan, Postlberger and Perez forming the escape bunch, but were unable to gain more than three minutes from the peloton. Cosnefroy attacked on the Col de la Colmiane, reaching the summit alone to claim the KOM points. By the time the main field reached the summit, the gap had closed to two minutes, as many riders were dropped from the peloton including the yellow jersey of Kristoff and Mads Pedersen. By the climb of the Col d'Eze with 40 km to go, the breakaway group had been caught and Nicolas Roche was the first over the top. With 13 km to go in the stage, on the day's final climb, Alaphilippe attacked and was joined by Adam Yates and Marc Hirschi. Led by the Jumbo squad of Primož Roglič and Tom Dumoulin, the peloton chased, but the trio managed to stay away on the descent and build a small gap. During the pursuit, Michał Kwiatkowski bumped into Dumoulin, causing a violent crash and interrupting the pace Team Jumbo was setting in pursuit of the breakaway. Approaching the finish line on the Promenade des Anglais, the peloton was only two seconds behind as Alaphilippe won the day and the yellow jersey for the second time in his career, as Hirschi, Yates, Greg Van Avermaet and Sergio Higuita rounded out the top 5.\nStage three departed the Allianz Riviera en route to Sisteron. Jérôme Cousin, Perez and Cosnefroy were involved in the breakaway, with the latter two racing for the right to wear the polka dot jersey in the early stages. Perez won enough points to take the jersey from Cosnefroy and was therefore in the virtual jersey when they both fell back from the group to rejoin the peloton, leaving Cousin on his own with over a hundred kilometres to go. Perez, however, crashed into his team car, and then the side of the mountain on the descent when the car suddenly stopped in front of him and he was forced to abandon the race. Cosnefroy retained the jersey as a result and would be in good position to defend it over the next few stages. Cousin was caught with 16 km to go. The sprint finish saw Sam Bennett appear to be in very good position to claim his first ever stage in the Tour de France when a late charging Ewan came by Sagan, Hugo Hofstetter, Giacomo Nizzolo as well as Bennett to take the win.\nStage four was anticipated to be the first test among the GC riders to see who was in the best form being as the stage finished with a climb. In the same region that Luis Ocaña had his famous solo breakaway in 1971. The breakaway of six riders formed and took the majority of the intermediate sprint and mountains points with one of the riders, Tiesj Benoot crashing and actually splitting his seatpost in two. Benoot avoided serious injury and continued the race as the breakaway eventually fragmented with the final escapee in Krists Neilands being caught as the final climb began. Wout van Aert and Sepp Kuss set the pacemaking late in the stage shaking off everyone but the group of favorites. Kuss drove a dominant pace all the way up the climb when with 500 meters to go Guillaume Martin attacked and Kuss peeled off as his teammate Roglič and the rest of the favorites pursued. Roglič won the stage definitively with Tadej Pogačar coming in 2nd, Martin finishing 3rd, Nairo Quintana in 4th and Alaphilippe finishing 5th retaining the yellow jersey. Other favorites in Defending champ Egan Bernal, Dumoulin, Lopez, Mikel Landa and 2nd place overall Adam Yates also came across in good order. Stage five was a flat stage in which several breakaways were attempted, but none actually succeeded. Cosnefroy grabbed the two points to stay in the polka dot jersey while Sam Bennett took the intermediate sprint points and finished 3rd at the finish line, behind Cees Bol and stage winner Wout van Aert, to claim the green jersey from Sagan. The yellow jersey also switched riders as race leader Julian Alaphilippe accepted food inside 20 km to go, which is a penalty for safety reasons, and was docked twenty seconds. As a result, Yates took over the maillot jaune, although he was less than pleased to learn that he was being awarded it in this manner as he stated, \"Nobody wants to take the jersey like this. I was on the bus and we were about to leave for the hotel when I got the call…. tomorrow I'll give it everything to defend the jersey…\" This was the second time being involved in a controversial swapping of the yellow jersey for Yates as during the 2016 edition when Chris Froome ended up running up Mont Ventoux Yates finished the stage and was temporarily officially in yellow by a few seconds over Froome, until after the stage was over and the Jury decided to give Froome the same time as Bauke Mollema who had also been involved in the incident, which allowed Froome to keep his lead.\nStage six began at Le Teil and finished at Mont Aigoual, a climb made famous by writer and semi-pro cyclist Tim Krabbé. The stage saw a large group of riders form an escape bunch including Van Avermaet, Roche, Cavagna, Powless, Herrada, Lutsenko, Oss and Edvald Boasson Hagen. Their gap eventually exceeded six minutes and Herrada, Van Avermaet, Lutsenko and Powless would survive to finish ahead of the peloton with Lutsenko riding away from everyone and soloing to victory. Yates would perform well and defend his yellow jersey with a three-second advantage over Roglič, with the majority of the other GC contenders about ten seconds behind him. Stage seven saw a major split in the main field due in part to the weather, with very high crosswinds creating splits in the peloton, and due to the extreme pace set very early on in the stage by the Ineos Grenadiers and Team Bora on the first climb of the day, who were trying to drop the competition of Peter Sagan who was aiming to reclaim the green jersey from Bennett. The plan worked out for both teams as not only were the sprinters and contenders for the stage win in Bennett, Nizzolo, Kristoff, Bol and Ewan left behind, but so were many of Bernal's competitors in the GC who lost over a minute by the end of the day. Riders who had their hopes at victory or a podium finish take a serious hit included Mollema, Pogačar, Landa, Porte and Carapaz while Bernal, Roglič, Dumoulin, Lopez, Yates, Urán, Pinot, Bardet, Quintana and Guillaume Martin survived in the lead group securing their position. The most significant breakaway attempt of the day came from veteran Belgian rider Thomas De Gendt, who rode solo for about 60 kilometers, but he was caught by the lead group long before the finish. At the finish line Wout van Aert took his second stage win in three days besting Boasson Hagen and Bryan Coquard at the line. Yates remained in the overall lead, Sagan was back in the green jersey and Bernal took the white jersey from Pogačar.\nThe second week and Pyrenees.\nStage eight was a mountain stage where a breakaway of thirteen riders eventually formed and began to build a gap. Being as none of the escaped riders were a threat to the GC contenders the peloton allowed them to extend their advantage. The intermediate sprint was won by Cousin with Cosnefroy defending the polka dot jersey taking maximum points on the first climb of the day which was the infamous Col de Menté. With the gap back to the main field continuously growing it became clear the breakaway riders would fight amongst themselves for the stage win on the upcoming Port de Balès and Col de Peyresourde. Nans Peters and Ilnur Zakarin had the strongest legs and fought for the stage win, with Peters attacking and dropping Zakarin to solo to victory. Toms Skujiņš and Carlos Verona both rode strongly, and eventually caught and dropped Zakarin to round out the stage podium. Zakarin crossed 4th and in 5th was Neilson Powless, who wasn't even supposed to be in the breakaway as Team EF intended to get either Dani Martínez or Hugh Carthy into the break, but Powless was in the right place at the right time when the attacks came. When asked about it following the race he stated, \"It's amazing… it's incredible. If my role was to sit in the group and support Rigo... I’d be happy, and that will be my role soon enough.\"\nAmong the GC contenders there were some shakeups, notably including top French contender Pinot seeing his chances slip away due to a back injury, Alaphilippe struggling and also losing over ten minutes and Tom Dumoulin losing two minutes. Gaining time was Tadej Pogačar, who attacked on the final climb making up some of the time he lost in the crosswinds the previous day, putting himself back into the top 10 in the process.\nStage nine was the second Pyreneean mountain stage. Four riders had abandoned the race the previous stage leaving 168 riders to sign in and start the stage. The breakaway attempts were thwarted from early on in the day as Jumbo and Ineos attempted to control and dictate the pace for the benefit of Roglič and Bernal. Cosnefroy jumped out front in the first 10 km in defense of the polka dot jersey and Swiss rider Marc Hirschi made a serious attack to escape but it never materialized. and also attempted to get a breakaway formed and Alaphilippe of took a shot at trying to get away as well. Tom Dumoulin became the most powerful super-domestique in the race when he sacrificed himself for the team during the previous stage and in conjunction with the climbing abilities of George Bennett, Wout van Aert and Sepp Kuss team Jumbo was proving to be the strongest team in the Tour. For the previous decade it has unquestionably been Team Sky/Ineos Grenadiers, however they were missing both Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas. Even without these former champs Ineos was still a threat to defend as champs and the jockeying of these teams controlled the race until Marc Hirschi broke free with 90 km to go on the first Cat-1 climb of the day. About eight other riders tried bridging the gap up to him and formed an escape group including Thibaut Pinot attempting to set something up for his teammates to go for a stage win, Sébastien Reichenbach among them. Also taking their shot was Warren Barguil, Omar Fraile, Lennard Kämna and Dani Martínez, but they were not able to catch Hirschi, who had a gap extending beyond +2:00 and was the only rider up the road. Fabio Aru of team , who had come into the race as team leader, fell into difficulty and off the back leaving Pogačar, who was riding in his first Tour, as the GC hope for the team. At most Hirschi had a gap exceeding +4:30 but by the time he began the final climb on the Col de Marie-Blanque a minute had been shaved off that. Van Aert and Kuss of viciously attacked the climb at the head of the elite group and as the summit approached Hirschi's lead had been cut to about +0:30. Pogačar launched an attack with about 3 km to go, which was answered by most of the GC riders but the yellow jersey of Adam Yates began to fall behind. Egan Bernal was the next rider to attack and of the final group only Roglič, Landa and Pogačar went with him. With 2 km to go Hirschi, who had been riding solo for 88 km, pulled up as he realized he had been caught. He was not dropped however, so hope for the stage win was not yet lost, and these five riders rode on towards the finish. Hirschi launched his sprint first, however Pogačar and Roglič bested him on the line with Pogačar becoming the youngest stage winner in decades and Roglič becoming the first Slovenian rider to wear the yellow jersey as the majority of the other GC riders limited their losses to about ten seconds or so, not including time bonuses. Bernal was now in 2nd +0:21 behind, Guillaume Martin was in 3rd at +0:28 with Quintana, Bardet, Uran and Pogačar not far behind him.\nFollowing the rest day stage ten was slated to be a flat stage along the Atlantic coast from the island of Oléron to the island of Île de Ré. Before the start of the stage it was revealed that Director of the Tour de France Christian Prudhomme had tested positive for COVID-19. He was not in any contact with riders or team members so the race wasn't effected but he did move into isolation for seven days. The attacks came as soon as 'the race is on' was declared with Stefan Küng of Team FDJ and Michael Schär of being the two riders who escaped the peloton. The pace of the main field was for the most part controlled by Deceuninck and as they intended the stage to finish in a bunch sprint. It would as the escapees never extended their lead much beyond +2:00 and were back within the bunch about 70 kilometers into the race at which point team Ineos Grenadiers and took control of the pace. There were a few crashes, including one between 7th place Pogačar and 3rd place Guillaume Martin, neither of whom lost time but they both had to put in a hard chase to get back to the group. Küng attacked again on the bridge to Île de Ré but was brought back and with 10 km to go the leadout trains began to form for the upcoming sprint. Coquard, Greipel, Pedersen and Elia Viviani were all there in the end but the podium was filled by Sagan, Ewan and Sam Bennett, who claimed his first stage win in the Tour de France. Bennett also reclaimed the green jersey from Sagan and would not relinquish the Maillot Vert for the rest of the Tour. This would end up becoming the first time Peter Sagan finished a Tour de France where he did not win the Points Competition.\nStage eleven was another flat stage suited perfectly for a bunch sprint and this is what it turned out to be once the Most Combative Rider and only breakaway rider in Mathieu Ladagnous was caught by the bunch. In the final kilometers the leadout trains formed for Sagan and Bennett, who were fighting for the green jersey, as well as those going for the stage win in Coquard, Hoffstetter, Pedersen, Ewan, Van Aert, Mezgec and Clément Venturini of who was being led out by Oliver Naesen. Ewan won the day in a photo-finish with Sagan initially finishing 2nd followed by Bennett in 3rd. Ewan said of the win, \"Once you have one you want two, and now I have two. I want a third on the Champs-Élysées... I didn't know if I'd won because I threw my bike and was looking down… but sometimes you can just feel it.\" Sagan was found guilty of improper sprinting and relegated to the bottom of the standings for the stage. This decision moved Bennett up to 2nd for the stage and made a notable difference in the green jersey standings.\n was absent with injury so they had come into the race with nothing to hope for but stage wins. They had several riders survive in the final group and two of them attacked near the end of the stage but it was Marc Hirschi who was able to stay away. His teammates Roche, Benoot and Kragh-Andersen refused to cooperate with Reichenbach, Rolland, Schachmann, Quentin Pacher and the others trying to chase him down. After coming up just short twice already, Hirschi won the stage in convincing fashion with no changes coming in the overall situation.\nStage thirteen saw numerous breakaway attempts early in the day but none of them managed to escape. About 60 km into the stage a large group of strong riders managed to get away and work together to continuously extend their advantage. Seventeen riders in the total including Geschke, Madouas, Schachmann, Alaphilippe, Powless, Kämna, Dani Martínez and Pierre Rolland among others. As the stage progressed their advantage grew and eventually reached +11:00 before it started coming down meaning the stage winner would come from this group. Late in the stage Powless of Team EF would attack and be joined by Schachmann of Team Bora, but eventually both of them would fall back and it would be their teammates Martínez and Kämna who would fight for the stage win with Martínez taking the victory by surging ahead in the final hundred meters before it came down to a sprint. Back down the road in the overall situation Primož Roglič attacked in an effort to build on his small lead. His attack worked as many of the GC contenders lost half a minute or more. Pogačar joined Roglič and stayed with him, as a result jumping from 7th place to 2nd place while Bernal dropped to 3rd. Bardet came into the day in 4th but along with Mollema suffered a crash and had to abandon the race. Martin fell out of the top 10 as Richie Porte rode strongly and broke into the top 10 for the first time.\nStage fourteen was a 194-kilometer-long hilly stage with four categorized climbs, three small ones and a single Cat-2, the Col du Béal. It was a tailor-made stage for Sagan, who had won several stages like this throughout his career and had more stage wins than any other rider in the Tour. His team, , intended to control the breakaways as well as the entire peloton in order to put him in position to win. The early breakaway consisted of Stefan Küng and Edward Theuns with Theuns winning the maximum intermediate sprint points and Küng dropping him on the climbs to claim the KOM points. They were caught after being away for about 100 km and the surviving peloton controlled the race from then on. Sagan was able to claim more points than Bennett in the sprints but was working hard to control the bunch as they had several surviving riders including Benoot, Andersen, Hirschi and even their sprinter Cees Bol, virtually any one of whom would be capable of winning the stage. Inside 12 km to go numerous attacks came one after another from some of the strongest riders in the sport including Van Avermaet, Alaphilippe, Sagan, De Gendt, Benoot and Hirschi but all of these attempts were contained. The only rider to stay away was Søren Kragh Andersen who launched his attack with 3 km to go, which nobody was able to match. Andersen crossed the line alone claiming his first Tour stage win and +0:15 later Simone Consonni and Luka Mezgec rounded out the podium ahead of Peter Sagan who finished 4th. The overall situation at the end of the second week remained static. Roglič and Team Jumbo were firmly in command of the race as he maintained his lead of just under a minute on Pogačar and defending champ Bernal and just over a minute on Urán and Quintana. The hardest part of the Tour was just ahead however, as beginning in stage fifteen there would be four consecutive high mountain stages in the Alps, which would be followed by more climbing with a difficult individual time trial.\nThe third week: the Alps, the time trial and the Champs-Élysées.\nThere were several attempts to get a breakaway formed early in stage fifteen but the accelerations of Sagan and Bennett fighting for intermediate sprint points frustrated all attempts. Eventually a group of eight would break free but they were unable to gain enough time to threaten for a stage win. Matteo Trentin of , who was in 3rd place in the points competition, attacked the breakaway and gained a lead of about twenty seconds while claiming the maximum intermediate sprint points, but he was eventually caught by the other breakaway riders. Back down the road in the main field there was a fairly serious crash when Bob Jungels accidentally grazed the front tire of Sergio Higuita causing the latter to viciously crash into the pavement. He remounted and tried to ride on but before long the pain set in and Higuita realized he might have been seriously hurt and had to abandon. He was taken to the hospital as a precaution; fortunately x-rays showed no broken bones. Later in the stage Michael Gogl of broke clear of the other breakaway riders and built a bit of a gap. Eventually Pierre Rolland of would also leave the rest of the escapees behind to join Gogl. These two were the final two riders up the road when the group of favorites caught them at the foot of the final climb, the Col du Grand Colombier, with the Rolland being awarded Most Combative Rider. On this climb Jumbo-Visma riders Van Aert, Bennett, Kuss and Dumoulin set a vicious pace that put many riders into serious difficulty including Guillaume Martin, Egan Bernal and Nairo Quintana. The climb was seventeen kilometers long and about halfway through Yates attacked and got away briefly, but was only able to stay away for a kilometer or so before he was caught. As it neared the final kilometer one of the only riders still strong enough to attack after the assault of the Jumbo-Visma riders was Richie Porte. He went clear and only Roglič, Pogačar and Miguel Ángel López went with him. In the end Pogačar accelerated ahead of Roglič to take the stage victory as Porte crossed 3rd +0:05 later with Lopez in 4th three seconds beyond Porte. Coming in +0:15 behind Roglič and Pogačar was Enric Mas, Sepp Kuss, who had put in much of the work for Roglič, Mikel Landa and Adam Yates with Rigoberto Urán and veteran rider Alejandro Valverde of a few seconds after that. Quintana was able to limit his losses and remain in the top 10, but Bernal was not and this effectively ended the championship reign of Team Ineos. Stage winner Pogačar commented after the stage, \"I don't know what happened to Bernal, but set a terrible pace and some riders paid for it.\" Overall Roglič was still in command of the maillot jaune by +0:40 over Pogačar and +1:34 over Rigoberto Urán, with López, Yates, Porte and Landa within about two minutes going into the final rest day.\nFollowing the rest day the testing of the riders, trainers and staff continued as usual. Throughout the race a handful of staff from four different teams had come back positive but all 785 personnel inside the 'race bubble' tested negative prior to stage sixteen, so all 156 riders still in the race signed in to start. It was a mostly clear day, about 75 degrees and included five categorized climbs with two Cat-2's and a Cat-1 among them. With less climbing than other high mountain stages major changes in the GC were not anticipated, but there would be no shortage of riders hoping for a stage win. As such the attacks and breakaway attempts began almost as soon as 'the race is on' was declared. Eight kilometers into the stage Pinot, Alaphilippe, Richard Carapaz of Team Ineos and twenty-two other riders went clear. Nine kilometers later Carapaz attacked again shaking up this group. By the time of the sixty kilometer mark there were twenty-three riders in the breakaway. The surviving peloton was content to let this group get away as Tony Martin and Robert Gesink took their turns for Jumbo-Visma at the front of the main field. Eventually the breakaway would have a gap exceeding +12:00, which would continue to widen, but the size of the group would be whittled down as the race rolled on. With 35 kilometers to go Quentin Patcher attacked and rode off the front of the group. After following a long turn at the front by Andrey Amador four others rode off in pursuit of Patcher with Carapaz, Reichenbach, Kämna and Alaphilippe. Several of these riders had claimed KOM points but Benoît Cosnefroy would still be in the polka dot jersey at the end of the day. As the stage neared the finish nearly +17:00 separated the leaders on the road from the group of favorites and eighteen of the breakaway riders would finish ahead of the elite group. Lennard Kämna launched the decisive move reaching the finish line more than a minute ahead of Carapaz, who would be awarded the only red number for his combativeness. None of the breakaway riders were a threat to the overall leaders and there were no major attacks or changes in the standings among them.\nStage seventeen was the queen stage and being as it included two Cat-HC climbs where the riders would climb above 6,000 feet in elevation on both occasions, it was the type of stage which could decide the Tour. Right from the start about twenty riders broke clear either chasing sprint points or trying to form an escape bunch to go for the stage win. Among them Thomas De Gendt tried his luck to attack the breakaway and built a bit of a gap. By the time they reached the first climb, Col de la Madeleine five riders were at the front. Carapaz, Alaphilippe and Kämna were battling each other for the second day in a row and Gorka Izagirre and Dan Martin were right there among them. Kämna was the first to fall back as this group would have a gap of better than six minutes before it started coming down. Martin eventually got dropped as the gap to the breakaway continued to steadily wither due to Damiano Caruso and Pello Bilbao of Team driving a hard pace at the front of the yellow jersey group for the benefit of Mikel Landa. As a result, the next riders over the first climb were in the elite group and Pogačar took the 3rd place mountains points which was enough for him to take the polka dot jersey from Cosnefroy. Going up the final climb, the Col de la Loze Carapaz was the only rider left out front but his gap was being reduced with each passing kilometer. Carapaz was eventually caught and as the stage approached the finish the pace set by Roglič dropped all of the surviving contenders except for Porte, Pogačar, 'Superman' Lopez and his own teammate Sepp Kuss. It would be Lopez who launched the decisive move to claim the stage win and while both Roglič and Pogačar tried to chase him down he won the stage as Roglič added +0:15 to his lead over Pogačar and beyond that to everybody else in the race. Roglič now had a lead of +0:57 on Pogačar as Lopez jumped up to third on the podium at +1:26 behind. Porte, Yates, Uran and Landa were now all beyond +3:00 from Roglič, but separated from one another by barely twenty seconds.\nEgan Bernal, Stefan Küng, Mikel Nieve and Jens Debusschere either did not start, did not finish or finished outside the time limit on stage seventeen leaving 150 riders to sign in at the start of stage eighteen. In the case of Mikel Nieve this was notable because prior to his abandon he had finished every grand tour he had started his entire career, eighteen of them in a row, and finished inside the top 25 of every one of them. There was a neutral start to the stage, but after this section was cleared 'the race is on' was declared and the attacks came quickly. Sagan and Bennett continued battling for the green jersey with Bennett extending his lead by another five points at the first sprint of the day. 32 riders broke clear initially, but on the first climb of the day it would be reduced to 19. About an hour into the stage the active rider with the 2nd most career wins, German rider André Greipel of Team , called it quits and abandoned. Carapaz, Alaphilippe and Marc Hirschi were fighting amongst themselves for KOM points being as they were all within striking distance of the polka dot jersey of Pogačar. Hirschi took some points early but he would eventually crash while trying to rejoin the breakaway group, which he would never get back to, although he would be named most combative rider for the third time in the Tour. In the end the day belonged to Team Ineos as the final surviving riders were both Ineos riders in Michał Kwiatkowski and Richard Carapaz. They both celebrated while casually cruising across the finish line with Kwiatkowski getting the stage victory and Carapaz securing the polka dot jersey from Pogačar. Among the GC riders Mikel Landa launched a furious attack to escape from the yellow jersey group and several highly placed riders lost time including Quintana, Yates and Uran. Richie Porte also fell back after getting a flat tire on the gravel section but he was able to make it back to the elite group meaning places 1-4 were the same as the previous day. 5th place was now occupied by Landa and in 6th place Enric Mas of was the only other rider within +5:00 of Roglič. With the high mountains finished Roglič seemed to be in a secure position as far as winning the Tour, but after the stage he was not about to declare the race over yet as he commented, \"After the time trial there will be a decision known of the rankings but also tomorrow is another day to be really focused. It's far from being really safe.\"\nStage nineteen saw an early breakaway by Rémi Cavagna who attacked four kilometers into the stage. Not long after a chase group formed with the intent of bridging up to him. In this group was Geoffrey Soupe of Team , Cyril Barthe, Dylan van Baarle and Max Walscheid. Also in this chase group was Guillaume Martin, although his presence was not welcome in the breakaway because he was highly placed in the general classification which meant the peloton would be far more likely to increase their pace to prevent any advantage where the escape group might threaten for the stage win. Martin however, did not care as he was concerned with winning the Tour de France, but once he realized he could not realistically break back into the top 10 he fell back into the bunch. By the halfway point of the stage all of these chase riders would be back in the fold as Cavagna was still up the road with about a two-minute gap. He too would be caught before long and then later in the stage another breakaway of twelve riders went off the front. In this group were the three riders fighting for the green jersey in Bennett, Sagan and Matteo Trentin, who was not far behind Sagan in the points competition, on this last stage to win serious points before the finale in Paris. Sagan attacked this group twice, trying to make it a decisive victory over Bennett but he could never break away. The only one who did break free was Søren Kragh Andersen who had gotten away from a similar breakaway group a week earlier. With sixteen kilometers left he got out in front and his advantage only grew from there. The Dane would win the stage by nearly a minute as Luka Mezgec and Jasper Stuyven rounded out the stage podium. The overall situation remained exactly the same going into the penultimate individual time trial of stage twenty.\nOf the early riders to complete the time trial, the best time of the day was put in by Rémi Cavagna, who would lead the race for several hours. Wout van Aert would eventually beat his time. Ninth place rider Tom Dumoulin would beat Van Aert's time by ten seconds to put himself in first position, placing him in serious contention for the stage win. Landa did not threaten to win the stage but rode strongly enough to jump to 4th place overall for the second time in his career. Fourth place rider Richie Porte, who fell short of Dumoulin's time by less than a second, moved into 3rd place overall. Porte took the final podium position, becoming just the second Australian rider to make a Tour de France podium. Lopez would fall to 5th place in the general classification. Primož Roglič, wearing the maillot jaune, was the final rider to take the start gate two minutes after 2nd place Pogačar. By the time he hit the first checkpoint he too was riding strongly, but was a few seconds behind Pogačar, who was absolutely flying by this point. The performance was touted as \"historic\" and received comparisons to the LeMond-Fignon tour finish. As Pogačar approached the finish it was all but certain that he was going to win his third stage, win the white jersey, take the polka dot jersey from Carapaz and win the Tour de France by close to, if not over a minute. Pogačar gained a minute and 56 seconds on Roglič, winning the stage, the general classification, mountains classification, and young rider's classification in the process. Pogačar became the first rider to win the tour on a penultimate time trial since Cadel Evans in 2011 and the first since Laurent Fignon to win the race in his Tour debut and the first since Eddy Merckx to win three jerseys in a single Tour.\nStage twenty one was the celebration ride into Paris for Pogačar and . Once the circuit finish around the Champs-Élysées began the stage turned into the sprinters teams containing any attacks to see to it this coveted sprinters stage ended in a bunch sprint. As the finish approached Max Walscheid, Caleb Ewan, Wout van Aert, Bryan Coquard, former Champs-Élysées winner Alexander Kristoff of Team UAE, Elia Viviani of Team and Hugo Hofstetter of Team all fought their way to the front to go for the win but it was Sagan, Pedersen and Sam Bennett who filled the podium with Bennett taking the win and putting an exclamation point on his green jersey winning Tour.\nThe final podiums included Sam Bennett in the green jersey, Marc Hirschi as the Most Combative Rider and the team competition was won by for the 3rd year in a row. The white jersey, polka dot jersey and yellow jersey were all won by Tadej Pogačar.\nClassification leadership and minor prizes.\nFour main individual classifications and a team competition were contested in the race. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each rider's finishing times on each stage. Time bonuses (time subtracted) were awarded at the end of every stage apart from the time trial stages. The first three riders received 10, 6, and 4 seconds, respectively. In an effort to animate racing in the general classification, time bonuses of 8, 5, and 2 seconds respectively were also awarded for the first three riders across a mountain summit, given out on eight climbs. These occurred on stages 2, 6, 8, 9, 12, 13, 16, and 18. For crashes within the final of a stage, not including time trials and summit finishes, any rider involved received the same time as the group he was in when the crash occurred. The rider with the lowest cumulative time was the winner of the general classification and was considered to be the overall winner of the Tour.\nAdditionally, there was a points classification. Riders received points for finishing among the highest placed in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints during the stage. The points available for each stage finish were determined by the stage's type, and sprints, with the first fifteen places in all receiving points. In flat stages, 50 points were given to the stage winner, down to 2 points for 15th place. In hilly stages, the winner gained 30 points, also down to 2 points. In mountain stages, individual time trials and intermediate sprints, 20 points were given to the winners, down to 1 point. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified with a green jersey.\nThere was also a mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second-, and first-category and \"hors catégorie\", with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Mountains ranked \"hors catégorie\" gave 20 points to the first rider to cross the summit, down to 2 points to the 8th cyclist. For first-category climbs, 6 riders received points, with 10 for the first rider to reach the summit. Second-, third- and fourth-category climbs gave 5, 2 and 1 points to the first rider respectively. Double points were awarded at the top of the Méribel Col de la Loze in the seventeenth stage, the highest point in the 2020 Tour at above sea level. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and wore a white jersey with red polka dots.\nThe final individual classification was the young rider classification, which was identical to the general classification, but including only riders under 26 years. In order to compete in the classification, riders were required to be born after 1 January 1995. The leader of the young rider classification wore a white jersey.\nThe classification for the teams was calculated by adding together the times of the first three cyclists of a team on each stage; the leading team was the one with the lowest cumulative time. The number of stage victories and placings per team determined the outcome of a tie. The riders on the team that led this classification were identified with yellow number bibs on the back of their jerseys and yellow helmets.\nIn addition, there was a combativity award given after each stage to the rider considered, by a jury, to have \"made the greatest effort and who demonstrated the best qualities of sportsmanship\". No combativity awards were given for the time trials and the final stage. The winner wore a red number bib for the following stage. At the conclusion of the Tour, the overall super-combativity award was awarded by a jury.\nA total of €2,293,000 was awarded in cash prizes in the race. The overall winner of the general classification received €500,000, with the second and third placed riders receiving €200,000 and €100,000 respectively. All finishers in the top 160 were awarded money. The holders of the classifications were awarded on each stage they led; the final winners of the points and mountains were awarded €25,000, while the best young rider and most combative rider were awarded €20,000. The team classification winners earned €50,000. €11,000 was awarded to the winners of each stage of the race, with smaller amounts given to places 2–20. There was also a special award with a prize of €5000: the Souvenir Henri Desgrange, given to the first rider to pass the summit of the highest climb in the Tour, the Col de la Loze on stage 17."

        "title": "Uruguay national cricket team",
        "text": "The Uruguay national cricket team represents Uruguay in international cricket matches. They have mainly played against regional rivals Argentina, playing against them 29 times between 1868 and World War II, winning on six occasions.\nIn 2018, the team finished second place in the annual South American Cricket Championship hosted in Colombia.In 2023, the Team Finished Second place in the South American Cricket Championship held in Buenos Aires, Argentina\nHistory.\nThe Victoria Cricket Club was established as far back as 1842. Far away from home, in distant Montevideo, the expatriate Englishmen had yearned to play the familiar sports of their land. Hence, the local Uruguayans passing by often saw the foreigners indulging in the strange game of willow and leather.\nIn 1861, the Victoria Cricket Club was re-established as the Montevideo Cricket Club (MVCC), and like any other Latin American cricket club, it branched into rugby, football, and gradually field hockey and tennis. In the World Rugby Museum of Twickenham, MVCC is listed as the eighth oldest rugby union club in the world, the oldest outside Europe.\nCricket did maintain a toehold as well. In 1868, the Montevideo Cricket Club played against Argentina’s Buenos Aires Cricket Club in their home ground La Blanqueda, marking the first international match in South America.\nTen years later, the club took on the crew of a visiting vessel in a football game — the first such match played in the land. And with that cricket took a backseat in the country. However, cricket teams of Montevideo — formed by appending a few players to the Montevideo Cricket Club — did take part in two matches against English sides.\nThe first was played at the Blanqueda ground over two days during the festival period in 1926, against a reasonably strong Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side. A figure as notable as Plum Warner led the team. Although 53 at that time, he was after all a former England captain. The team was loaded with experienced First-Class cricketers. Gubby Allen sat out for the match against Montevideo, but there was the England left-arm spinner Jack White and his guile was a bit too much for the local batsmen to handle.\nMCC batted first and Irish-born Hampshire batsman Tom Jameson notched up a hundred. Guy Jackson of Derbyshire and Warner hit half centuries before the innings was closed at 366 for seven. Not all the bowlers were butchered, though. The impressive medium pacer HL Pennock picked up five for 107.\nIn response, Montevideo’s innings lasted only 19.3 overs. White was too classy for the local talent and only Pennock managed to enter double figures by scoring 12. White’s figures read seven for 27 in 9.3 overs and the total stuttered and stumbled to reach 64.\nIn the second innings, the home side did little better. Jameson, now enjoying himself with the ball, picked up five wickets. A lot of the bowling was also done by Lord Dunglass, the least accomplished cricketer of the side. But this minor cricketer, who answered to the full name Alec Douglas-Home and later became the Prime Minister of Britain, captured four wickets. The hosts folded for just 98 on Christmas Day.\nThe next major match for the Montevideo side was played in January 1938 on the same Blanqueda ground. It was against a strong English side led by Sir Theodore Brickman. The team boasted several big names – including celebrated ageing stalwarts like Andy Sandham and RES Wyatt, as well as other Test stars like Jim Sims, Arthur Wood, Jack Durston and Fred Price.\nHowever, the home bowlers did an appreciable job in restricting the visiting batsmen. Fifties by Wyatt and the Warwickshire veteran Reg Santall helped to take Sir Theodore Brickman’s XI to 280. Pennock, still going strong after 11 years, captured three wickets. The bowlers were helped along by some cavalier batting as well, and the runs were plundered in just 36overs.\nHowever, the batting of the home side was too brittle to capitalise on the good work. Eddie Watts, the Surrey teammate of Alf Gover and also his brother-in-law, ran through the batting with able help from Wyatt and the occasional fare of Sandham. The 80 runs that the home side scored came in just 11 overs. It was fireworks all around.\nIn the second innings, Wyatt plundered 187, with minor counties batsman Harold Dods blasting another hundred. As many as 411 runs were amassed in just 50.1 overs before Sir Brickman declared the innings. Poor Pennock gave away 106 runs in nine overs, although he had the consolation of accounting for Wyatt and Watts.\nWith the target a staggering 600, the hosts surrendered to Jim Sims whose legbreaks bamboozled seven batsmen in the space of eight overs. In a curious coincidence, Sims finished with seven for 27, the same figures Jack White had achieved 11 years earlier. The hosts were skittled for 124, losing by 475 runs. Since then, the cricketers of Uruguay have never really played against a major cricketing power. Even in the South American scene, they have been left far behind by Argentina.\nIndian cricketers in Uruguay.\nMany workers at Tata Consultancy Services are native Indians and play cricket; so, the Uruguayan national cricket team is revealingly made up of South Asians.\nCurrent squad.\nCurrent squad:\nFuture plans.\nThe Uruguayan Cricket Association has many plans for the future and working hard for augmenting cricket in Latin soil. In December, the team will travel to Buenos Aires to play a game against Argentina. It will be in commemoration of the first confrontation that both countries had in cricket, 150 years ago. The rematch will be in Montevideo."

        "title": "Dublin University Fencing Club",
        "text": "Dublin University Fencing Club (DUFC) is the fencing club of Trinity College Dublin, located in Dublin, Ireland. The club caters for foil, épée and sabre. Its members are students, alumni and staff from Trinity College with a small amount of visiting fencers from other clubs.\nEarly history.\nIn 1730, a group of students from Trinity College formed a \"Gentleman's Club of the Sword\", or the \"Gentleman's Society of the Sword\" as it has also been called. This club, while initially hugely popular fell out of use by the last quarter of the 18th century. In 1774, Provost John Hely-Hutchinson formally established fencing in Trinity by employing a fencing-master and designating the Senate House specifically for this purpose. With the further decline of duelling throughout the 18th and no record of the club throughout the 19th century, it is not until the formation of the modern D.U. Fencing Club in 1936 that the sport was reestablished in the college.\nPresent status.\nSince its foundation, DUFC has grown vastly. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, membership was about fifty fencers in general with an Intervarsities team of 8. In contrast, the 2009/2010 season saw intake of approximately 300 new members with an Intervarsities contingent of 24 competing, with similar numbers maintained in the club since.\nThe club's most decorated coach, Professor Patrick Duffy, coached the club from 1952 until 1987. Following his death in 1987, \"The Professor Duffy Memorial Team Épée\" tournament was inaugurated by D.U.Fencing Club. This competition is still run today and attracts teams from Germany, Italy and the U.K. regularly.\nThe club has maintained its status as a centre of excellence, consistently ranking at the top of the national club medal table in Ireland. During the 2017/18 season, Dublin University Fencing Club became part of the \"Trinity Sport high performance programme,\" giving its first team access to additional strength and conditioning coaching, physiotherapy, anti-doping and nutritional expertise.\nNotable alumni.\nSince the formation of the modern club, a number of members have gone on to represent the club and their country in both fencing and the modern pentathlon. Some of these members are listed below.\nCompetitions.\nHosted competitions.\nD.U.Fencing Club hosts a number of competitions on an annual basis. Events currently hosted are listed below:\nThe Colours Match.\nKnown colloquially as \"Colours,\" The Colours Match (the fencing equivalent of its rugby counterpart) is hosted yearly between Dublin University and University College Dublin with each club cycling hosting privileges yearly.\nHonours.\nPinks.\nPinks are awarded for outstanding service to a sports club, usually with regard to representative honours, by the Central Athletic Club (D.U.C.A.C.). Athletes in D.U.Fencing Club who have received pinks are listed below followed by the year of the award."

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2018 Asian Games",
        "text": "A number of concerns and controversies surfaced before and during the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta and Palembang, Indonesia.\nPrior to the Games.\nJakarta, consistently ranked as having one of the world's worst traffic congestion problems, was building a subway. However, it would not be ready until 2019, so organizers had proposed closing schools during the event to curb traffic from millions of commuting pupils. Authorities also proposed to set aside toll roads and bus lanes for special official and athlete use during the Games. Jakarta has also instated an odd-even licence plate system to limit congestion.\nThe sidewalk of the Jendral Sudirman Road \"(Jalan Jendral Sudirman)\", the main corridor of the heart of Jakarta was having a revitalization. The revitalization is the preparation of the operational of the new subway network and the Asian Games. The sidewalk revitalization construction at the main road was overall uneven. Some parts of the sidewalks was finished, while the others was not finished yet. What became the center of attention is the condition of the bus stop at the front of the main venue of the games. The bus stop shelter was separated from the road by a corridor of grass which is the part of the new sidewalk. But eventually, a ramp was built to connect between the shelter and the road.\nAir pollution also became a concern in both cities. Jakarta has long struggled to boost air quality, regularly rated as unsafe by the World Health Organization (WHO) as Jakarta's average score on the Air Quality Index (AQI) had exceeded 100 during early July 2018, once reaching the \"unhealthy\" range at 171 on 11 AM, Tuesday, 17 July 2018. Palembang also had been constantly under risk of haze caused by peatland fire during dry season which coincides with the Games. Authorities are looking into the possibility of cloud seeding to combat the fire hotspots by triggering rainfall in dry areas with flares of salt shot into suitable clouds. Authorities covered a polluted, foul-smelling river near the Asian Games athletes' village in Jakarta with black nylon mesh over fears it will be an eyesore at the showpiece event.\nSecurity is another concern, with the Games taking place just a few months after a series of terror attacks, which killed dozens of people and provoked fear over Islamist militants. Some 100,000 security staff including bomb squad and sniper teams will be deployed in Jakarta, Palembang, and West Java, where the majority of events are hosted. Local police said they have been taking part in a pre-Asian Games crackdown on terror suspects and petty street criminals.\nThe Olympic Council of Malaysia (OCM) also raised concerns over Malaysian men's U-16 national football team security issues due to the recent provocations by Indonesian fans at venues and on social media, it was initially triggered after Malaysia won at the 2018 AFF U-19 Youth Championship at East Java. When the penalty shoot-out ended with a score 3–2 against the host, dissatisfied Indonesian supporters to throw bottles and rocks at the Malaysian team after their team failed to qualify to the finals which caused the Malaysian team to run to their dressing room for safety.\nOn 21 July 2018, less than one month from the Games, women football venue of Gelora Sriwijaya Stadium in Palembang had been partially damaged in a riot during local football league. At least 335 seats had been destroyed by the mob.\nOfficials had held Asian Games' men football tournament drawing three times due to protest from UAE and Palestine which were incidentally not included in the first drawing. Later, Iraq withdrew from tournament which forced officials to rebalance the groups by determining which of Palestine or UAE would be moved to Group C to replace Iraq.\nPrior to the start of the golf tournament of the Asian Games, several national golf associations complained to the Court of Arbitration for Sport that Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Macau and Uzbekistan had possibly entered professional golfers, but the CAS ruled that none of the players were professional as the golf tournament was reserved only for the amateur players.\nDuring the Games.\nAlcohol ban.\nThe Indonesian Asian Games Organizing Committee (INASGOC) banned athletes competing in the Games from consuming alcohol and outside food in their accommodation in the host cities of Jakarta and Palembang. On 28 August 2018, officials said they had confiscated many bottles and cans of beer that athletes and officials had tried to bring in from outside the athletes' villages.\nAlleged gratification.\nSince the sales of closing ceremony ticket, Indonesian anti-corruption commission, KPK has alleged to receive 14 free tickets with 13 of them had not been used. The gratification allegations started when the state enterprises of Indonesia (BUMN) bought several tickets, KPK has warned some officials in BUMN to report back of the buying. Jusuf Kalla, Vice President of Indonesia, had declared that \"it did not include in gratification because it is less than Rp 10 millions [threshold of official gratification in Indonesia]\". Even more, KPK had not known whether it was included in gratifications or not.\nAthletics.\nOn 25 August 2018, Hiroto Inoue won the Asian Games men's marathon in a controversial sprint finish, with Bahrain later lodging a complaint to race officials, accusing the Japanese runner of barging second-place finisher Elhassan Elabbassi. Meanwhile, on the same day, a cat ran into the track of the Gelora Bung Karno Main Stadium during the interval of women's 100m qualification competition.\nBasketball.\nCoach Yeng Guiao of the Philippine men's National Basketball team raised doubts as to why a Hong Kong referee officiated the match up between China and the Philippines. Despite having its own organized sports body, Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. He questioned the number of China's free throw attempts to the Philippines', 39 foul shots to 15. The Chinese team was assessed to only 16 fouls compared to the Philippines, 25.\nBoxing.\nIn women's 57 kg, Filipino boxer Nesthy Petecio lost a controversial bout against Chinese rival Yin Junhua to the surprise of most of the crowd at the Jakarta International Expo Hall C. Japanese and Turkmen judges ruled in favor of the Filipino while Bulgarian and South Korean judges ruled in favor of the Chinese. The French judge scored a 28–28, but later handed the fight to the Chinese to break the deadlock. Petecio shed tears of anger and stared at the judges. Philippine chef de mission Richard Gomez said it's a case of “bad call, bad decision and bad scoring” while Association of Boxing Alliances in the Philippines (ABAP) executive director Ed Picson blasted the result of the bout and appeals to officials “that the judges responsible for this travesty not be assigned to officiate in the coming Philippines fights as judges or referees.”\nFootball.\nLuis Milla, the head coach of Indonesian men's national football team called the referee Shaun Evans from Australia 'unfit' after he gave two controversial penalties during a game between Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. Milla was disappointed because the referee was biased during the whole game. \"The referee doesn't have any competence to officiate at the Asian Games. He [Shaun Evans] is not on that level. He's the [opponent’s] 12th player and I am sad that our players' struggle had to end like this,\" the Spanish coach said. The Indonesian goalkeeper, Andritany Ardhiyasa, added at the press conference, \"Today is a sad day for us because we were robbed by [the referee]. The second penalty should not have been awarded\".\nOrganizational issues.\nDuring the medal ceremony of men's 200 metre freestyle swimming on 19 August 2018, the flags of the three medalists crashed to the ground due to a technical malfunction. Sun Yang, the Chinese swimmer and the gold medalist of the event, immediately got off the podium, walked to some officials and demanded the medal ceremony to be conducted once again. The flags were re-attached to the hoist but couldn't be raised, therefore the military flagbearers resorted to holding up the medalist flags at the same height as the hoist frames, and the Chinese anthem was played for a second time.\nPencak Silat.\nOn 26 August 2018, in the Semifinal of Men's tanding 85 kg to 90 kg, Muhammad Robial Sobri, a Malaysian athlete, deliberately kicked his Singaporean opponent, Sheik Alauddin Sheik Ferdous, after the Singaporean had fallen to the ground.\nOn 27 August 2018, another Malaysian pencak silat athlete, Mohd Al-Jufferi Jamari accused the judges of bias. Even he was walked out off the final match, the furious three-time world champion left a damage in the changing room's partition at venue after the match, something for which the Malaysian delegation had apologized. Indonesia had won 14 out of 16 gold medals on offer, while several countries including Singapore and Iran had complain about the judging in this event, claiming that judges are favouring local athletes.\nOn the other hand, the Indonesian Asian Games Organizing Committee (INASGOC) chairman Erick Thohir, had rejected accusations of cheating, claiming that the game \"is open, with people can see it on television and it is clear\". Erick also insisted that they have \"monitor closely all judges, who are chosen by the Asian governing body\". He added that, \"We see the domination of certain countries in sports such as judo, karate and taekwondo. The funny thing is when Indonesia achieves such success, why do people complain?\".\nProstitution.\nFour Japanese basketball athletes were kicked out of the Games after buying sex in the notorious red light district in Jakarta. A case which the OCA President said it serve as the warning to other athletes.\nDoping.\nOn August 24, Turkmenistani wrestler, Rustem Nazarov became the first athlete to fail a doping test. Nazarov had competed in the men's 57 kilograms freestyle event on August 19 and was beaten 12–8 in his first match by India's Sandeep Tomar.\nOn September 2, Mongolian reigning world champion Orkhon Purevdorj was stripped of the gold medal she claimed in the women's 62 kilogram event. Purevdorj tested positive for anabolic steroid Stanazolol and received lengthy ban on sporting events."

However, unable to find sponsorship in the wake of the sport's ban on tobacco advertising, and with only around six tournaments a year at that point, he felt he could not afford to turn professional and so remained an amateur.\nIn 1999, he won by an 8–5 victory in the final against Andrew Norman. In the same year, he reached the semifinals of the Amateur European Championships and the final of the World Amateur Snooker Championship, in which he was defeated by Ian Preece 11–8.\nIn 2000, he lost the final of the English Amateur Championship, 5–8 against Nick Marsh.\nIn February 2002, he participated for the first time in qualifying for the World Snooker Championship, but lost in the second qualifying round against Timothy Paling.\nIn 2004, Lilley won the English Amateur Championship for a third time, with an 8–6 victory over Wayne Cooper in the final. In the 2004 World Amateur Snooker Championship, he was narrowly defeated in the semi-finals 6–8 by the eventual champion Mark Allen. In qualifying for the 2005 World Snooker Championship, he retired in the third round against Stuart Mann. In the English Amateur Championship 2007, he lost in the of the final against Martin Gould by 7–8.\nHe participated in the Players Tour Championship 2012/2013 – Event 2 in August 2012 and lost in the first qualifying round against Ben Harrison.\nLilley tried to qualify for the main tour via the 2016 Q School. In the first tournament he reached the final of his group but then lost against Chen Zhe; in the second tournament he retired in the second round. Although he missed the qualification for the Main Tour, as 17th on the Q-School Order of Merit he could participate as a substitute for tournaments of the 2016–17 snooker season.\nAt the 2016 Indian Open, the second world ranking tournament of the season, he qualified for a ranking tournament for the first time. After defeating Tian Pengfei 4–3 in qualifying, he eliminated Mike Dunn, Mark Williams and Robert Milkins in the main round to reach the quarterfinals, where he lost to England's Shaun Murphy 2–4.\nHe was first on the 2018 Q School Order of Merit. In the 18/19 season, he just missed out on gaining a tour card for the 19/20 season numerous times; he was 4th on the challenge tour list, and lost 5–4 to Kacper Filipiak in the 2019 EBSA European Snooker Championship, where a win would have granted him a place on the tour. He appeared in Snooker 19, making him the only player in the game who has never turned pro (the other amateurs in the game are former pros).\nLilley beat Sean Maddocks 4–0 in the final qualifying round of the first event of the 2019 Q School, finally becoming a professional after 30 years as an amateur. While an amateur, he had worked in the insurance industry. Lilley later remarked that his timing was bad, as no sooner had he joined the professional tour then the COVID-19 pandemic led to the mass cancellation of tournaments.\nOn 9 May 2021, Lilley overcame Jimmy White 5–3 to become the World Seniors Champion, entitling him to play in the 2021 Champion of Champions tournament. On 7 January 2022, Lilley was runner up to Peter Lines in the 2022 UK Seniors Championship, losing 4–1 in the final.\nAfter a successful 2023-2024 season - the best of his career in terms of ranking points - David finished the season ranked 64th, reaching the top 64 for the first time at the age of 48."

The game was played on 15 September 2019, at the Wukesong Arena, in Beijing, China, between Argentina and Spain.\nAt halftime, a turnover ceremony was held to officially hand over the hosting rights of the FIBA Basketball World Cup from China to the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia, hosts of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, which will take place from 25 August to 10 September.\nThe Naismith Trophy was awarded to the winning team for the first time since the unveiling of its new version in 2017.\nSpain won their second World Cup title after a 95–75 win. Marc Gasol became the first player since Lamar Odom in 2010 to win an NBA championship and a World Cup in the same year, and the first non-American to win an NBA or WNBA title and either a World Cup or Olympic gold medal in the same year.\nRoute to the final.\nArgentina.\nArgentina topped Group B in Wuhan, after beating Russia in the final group game. They also defeated South Korea and Nigeria to end with a 3–0 record in the first round. Group I in Foshan also saw the South Americans topping the group, thereby qualifying to the quarter-finals. Their win against Poland won them the group. In the quarter-finals at Dongguan, Argentina defeated 2014 World Cup runners-up and 2016 Olympic silver medalists Serbia by 10 points to qualify to the semi-finals. France, which had defeated the United States in their own quarter-final match-up, faced the South Americans in the semi-final at Beijing. Luis Scola scored his tournament-high 28 points in the game, and Rudy Gobert was limited to just three points, which led to Argentina advancing to its first World Cup final since 2002, which was Scola's first.\nSpain.\nThe Spaniards finished on top of Group C in Guangzhou. The Europeans defeated Tunisia, Puerto Rico and Iran to end up undefeated going into the second round. At the second round Group J at Wuhan, Spain ran away winners of the group after defeating Italy and erstwhile undefeated team Serbia to finish the group stages with a 5–0 record. In the quarter-finals at Shanghai, Spain eliminated surprise qualifiers Poland, off the back of Ricky Rubio's near double-double of 19 points and nine assists, plus five rebounds. A pair of three-point shots was the difference late in the fourth quarter that prevented the Poles from cutting the lead. In the semi-final against Australia at Beijing, the Australians led by as many as 11 points in the third quarter, but the Spaniards came back to tie the game at the end of regulation, 71-all. In overtime, Marc Gasol and Patty Mills scored three-pointers, but with the game tied at 78-all, Mills was fouled, and converted both free-throws. Gasol was fouled himself on the next possession, and also made both of his foul shots. Matthew Dellavedova tried to win it at the buzzer, but missed, sending the game to double overtime. Spain opened the second overtime with two three-pointers, and that was the difference, qualifying them to their second World Cup final, after winning it in 2006.\nGame details.\nThis is the eighth meeting between Argentina and Spain at the World Cup, with the Spaniards winning five; Argentina won two, including their last meeting at the 2010 World Championship. Spain won the last competitive meeting, at the 2016 Summer Olympics.\nSpain led by 14–2 at the start of the game. Argentina recovered to finish the first quarter with 14 points against Spain's 22. The lead then fluctuated, but once the Argentinians cut the deficit to twelve at the start of the third quarter, the Spaniards went on a 14–0 run, leading by 55–33. The Spaniards never looked back. Ricky Rubio scored 20 points in the game, and limited Facundo Campazzo to just 11 points in 20% field-goal percentage. Luis Scola was also limited to 1/10 shooting in the game, and didn't score until making his free-throws late in the third quarter, as Gabriel Deck had a game high 24 points. Marc Gasol scored 14 points, had a team high 7 assists, had 2 steals, and blocked 3 shots in the game. Argentina tried to mount a comeback in the fourth period, but by then the lead was too great, and there was little time remaining by then. Spain won its second World Cup, with Gasol and Fernández being also a part of the first title in 2006."

Pang was the more aggressive boxer throughout the bout and the verdict came as a shock to the Korean side. They protested inside the ring. Eventually the security personnels were required to remove them from the ring. Many of the spectators also thought Pang was the clear winner, so they booed the verdict and the boos continued even during the medal distribution ceremony. North Korea challenged the verdict. Though the verdict was not overturned, AIBA restored the right to challenge a verdict of the boxing bouts in future amateur boxing tournaments."

        "text": "The 2018 Go Bowling at The Glen was a Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series race held on August 5, 2018 at Watkins Glen International in Watkins Glen, New York. Contested over 90 laps on the road course, it was the 22nd race of the 2018 Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season. Chase Elliott scored his first career win in this race after holding off a hard-charging Martin Truex Jr. who was the defending winner from last year. This was the final race for Brian France as the CEO of NASCAR, as he was arrested for DUI hours after the race occurred. Jim France was the CEO starting at Michigan.\nReport.\nBackground.\nWatkins Glen International (nicknamed \"The Glen\") is an automobile race track located in Watkins Glen, New York at the southern tip of Seneca Lake. It was long known around the world as the home of the Formula One United States Grand Prix, which it hosted for twenty consecutive years (1961–1980), but the site has been home to road racing of nearly every class, including the World Sportscar Championship, Trans-Am, Can-Am, NASCAR Sprint Cup Series, the International Motor Sports Association and the IndyCar Series.\nInitially, public roads in the village were used for the race course. In 1956 a permanent circuit for the race was built. In 1968 the race was extended to six hours, becoming the 6 Hours of Watkins Glen. The circuit's current layout has more or less been the same since 1971, although a chicane was installed at the uphill Esses in 1975 to slow cars through these corners, where there was a fatality during practice at the 1973 United States Grand Prix. The chicane was removed in 1985, but another chicane called the \"Inner Loop\" was installed in 1992 after J.D. McDuffie's fatal accident during the previous year's NASCAR Winston Cup event.\nThe circuit is known as the Mecca of North American road racing and is a very popular venue among fans and drivers. The facility is currently owned by International Speedway Corporation.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nErik Jones was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 1:10.467 and a speed of .\nFinal practice.\nChase Elliott was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 1:10.832 and a speed of .\nQualifying.\nDenny Hamlin scored the pole for the race with a time of 1:10.260 and a speed of .\nRace.\nStage Results.\nStage 1\n\"Laps:\" 20\nStage 2\n\"Laps:\" 20\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage 3\n\"Laps:\" 50\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nNBC Sports covered the race on the television side.

        "text": "The 2018–19 UCLA Bruins men's basketball team represented the University of California, Los Angeles during the 2018–19 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Bruins played their home games at Pauley Pavilion as members in the Pac-12 Conference. They were led by sixth-year head coach Steve Alford until he was fired mid-season and assistant Murry Bartow was named the interim head coach. Their lineup featured three former McDonald's All-Americans: sophomores Jaylen Hands and Kris Wilkes were both named second-team All-Pac-12, while first-year player Moses Brown was voted to the Pac-12 All-Freshman Team. UCLA finished the season 17–16, and lost in the second round of the Pac-12 tournament. They missed the postseason for the second time in four years.\nRanked No. 21 in the preseason AP Poll, the Bruins began the season 4–0 and climbed to No. 17. However, they lost six of the next nine and finished with a 7–6 record in nonconference play, closing it out with four straight losses, the last of which was a 73–58 defeat to Liberty. They committed a season-high 24 turnovers in the game, and the 15-point setback was the most lopsided home loss in Alford's tenure with UCLA. Combined with an earlier home loss to mid-major program Belmont, it was the first time the Bruins had lost consecutive home games to non-Power Five schools since 2012–13. Four days after Belmont, they lost by 29 at Cincinnati, their largest margin of defeat since 2014–15. UCLA had not lost four straight since the end of 2015–16, when they finished the season under .500. They had not suffered four consecutive nonconference losses since 2010–11. On December 31, 2018, two days after the Bruins' loss to Liberty, UCLA fired Alford and named Bartow the interim head coach.\nThe Bruins were inconsistent under Bartow, logging as many three-game winning streaks as three-game losing streaks. They opened conference play 2–0 at home against San Francisco Bay Area schools Stanford and California. Emphasizing the team's speed and athleticism, he had the Bruins play more aggressive, trapping and applying pressure on defense and attacking on offense by running on both missed and made baskets. Six Bruins scored in double figures against Cal after five reached the threshold against the Cardinal. In their 13 non-conference games under Alford, UCLA never had more than four double-figure scorers. The Bruins won the following game in overtime 87–84 at Oregon after rallying from 17 points down with less than seven minutes left in the second half, and later trailing by nine with 51 seconds remaining. It was the largest comeback in the final minute of a Pac-12 game and tied the sixth-largest deficit overcome in the last minute in Division I history. UCLA's 3–0 start in the conference was their best since starting 5–0 in the Pac-12 in 2012–13, the last time they claimed a conference regular-season title. However, they lost their next three games, falling to 3–7 in their last 10, and 10–9 overall. After wins over Arizona and Washington State, during which they set season-highs in field goal percentage of 57.9 and 58.8 percent, respectively, they lost to Washington after committing 23 turnovers. The Bruins were 5–4 halfway through the conference schedule. While Bartow was pushing for a faster pace, an unintended consequence was UCLA's conference-leading 17.3 turnovers per game, almost four more than they committed during non-conference play.\nEntering the second half, UCLA had a favorable schedule with seven of their last nine regular-season games against schools that were ranked in the bottom half of the Pac-12. However, they lost their third straight game on February 9 after blowing a 22-point lead with 12:10 remaining in a 93–92 loss to Utah, which won on a buzzer-beating three-point field goal. The Bruins allowed 61 points in the second half, the most they had surrendered in a half since allowing 64 points in a win against Cal State Northridge in 1998. The Bruins dropped into a four-way tie for seventh place in the Pac-12. Combined with a loss earlier in the week to Colorado, it was the first time that UCLA had been swept in a home series since 2015–16. However, UCLA won four of their next five. The four wins consisted of two overtime games, a one-point victory, and a 19-point comeback. They entered the final week of the regular season with a chance to finish as high as third place in the conference, but lost their final two games to fall to seventh.\nIn their opening game of the Pac-12 tournament, UCLA switched to a man-to-man defense after having played predominantly zone under Bartow, and they defeated Stanford 79–72. Bruins freshman guard David Singleton broke his foot in the final minute, ending his season. The Bruins lost their next game 83–72 to second-seeded Arizona State in the quarterfinals. They were down by two points with 3:59 remaining before halftime. However, they were outscored 14–0 to end the half, and trailed by double-digits throughout most of the rest of the game. Afterwards, Bartow stated that he was not interested in having his interim tag removed, and expressed optimism that UCLA would \"hire a very good coach\".\nPrevious season.\nThe Bruins finished the 2017–18 season 21–12, 11–7 in Pac-12 play to finish in a three-way tie for third place. They defeated Stanford in the quarterfinals of the Pac-12 tournament to advance to the semifinals where they lost to Arizona. They received an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament where they lost in the First Four to St. Bonaventure.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non–conference regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 regular season\n!colspan=12 style=| Pac-12 Tournament"

The league sternly reprimanded the team as it found out that the players represented a school-based team, which is allowed by the league rules.\nSan Beda pulled away late in the third quarter with four three-pointers by AC Soberano transformed a 1-point Altas lead to an 11-point lead for the Red Lions early in the fourth quarter.

He was drafted 31st overall by the Capitals in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft.\nEarly life.\nAlexeyev was born on 15 November 1999 in Saint Petersburg, Russia.\nPlaying career.\nJunior.\nAlexeyev was drafted in the first round, third overall, by the Metallurg Novokuznetsk in the 2016 Kontinental Hockey League draft. He was later selected by the Red Deer Rebels in the Canadian Hockey League Import Draft and chose to move to North America to play hockey. \nUpon joining the Red Deer Rebels for the 2016–17 season, Alexeyev quickly began playing top minutes for the team. He was identified as a B prospect by Central Scouting in October and named as a prospect to watch for the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. Alexeyev was the most productive rookie on the team before he suffered an upper body injury in October. He subsequently missed nearly an entire month of games before returning on 22 November. He then suffered another injury in January and missed the remainder of the season while recovering from the surgery. During his time recovering, he also graduated from high school and worked on his English language skills. Prior to the injury, Alexeyev had tallied nine points through 10 games and ended with a total of 21 points in 41 games.\nAlexeyev returned to the Rebels lineup for the 2017–18 season but missed significant time due to personal matters and a shoulder injury. He suffered the shoulder injury early in October and was quickly listed as week-to-week following an MRI. He returned to the Rebels lineup and broke out offensively, quickly surpassing his previous season's totals. However, his output slowed down when he missed three weeks of games due to his mother's death. As a result of another injury, Alexeyev was limited to three post-season games during the WHL playoffs but he tallied two goals and three assists during this time against the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Alexeyev finished the season with seven goals and 30 assists through 45 games but was wary of his draft position due to his missed time. \nLeading up to the 2018 NHL Entry Draft, Alexeyev was ranked 30th amongst all eligible players by The Sports Network. He earned a higher ranking from the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, who listed him as 22nd overall after originally ranking him as 26th. Alexeyev drew comparisons to Jonas Brodin and was praised by Craig Button for being a \"smart, effective defenceman who moves the puck, plays with a calm and doesn't make things complicated for himself.\" Alexeyev was eventually drafted by the Washington Capitals 31st overall, the final selection of the first round. Following the draft, Alexeyev signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Capitals on 24 September.\nFollowing the NHL Entry Draft, Alexeyev attended the Capitals training camp but was returned to the Rebels for the 2018–19 season. Upon re-joining the team, Alexeyev recorded eight points through four games and was named the WHL On the Run Player of the Week for the week ending on 28 October. His continued output help the team earn early success and placed first in the Central Division and second in the Eastern Conference. He was subsequently selected to play for Team Russia in the 2018 CHL Canada/Russia Series after he tallied 20 points through 15 games, including two power-play goals and two game-winning goals. Following the series, Alexeyev continued his breakout season by accumulating 10 goals and 43 points through 49 games before suffering another injury. The injury was a result of a knee-on-knee collision during a game and resulted in Alexeyev being stretchered off the ice. This subsequently concluded his major junior career as he missed the final four games of the regular season and four more in the playoffs. Alexeyev finished his Rebels career with 21 goals and 80 assists for 101 points through 135 games in three WHL seasons.\nProfessional.\nFollowing his major junior season, Alexeyev rehabbed his knee off the ice with the Capitals American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Hershey Bears. He then returned to his home in Russia before joining the Washington Capitals for their 2019 development camp. It was originally suggested that Alexeyev could replace Michal Kempný in the Capitals lineup before he suffered an injury during the NHL's Prospect Showcase. He was subsequently assigned to the Bears for the 2019–20 season where he scored his first professional goal in his AHL debut. Alexeyev then tallied a goal and nine assists through 23 games to start the season with Hershey. Making developmental strides he completed his rookie season with 3 goals and 21 points in 58 games with the Hershey Bears. Alexeyev ranked third among Hershey defensemen and 12th among all AHL rookie defensemen in points. Alexeyev led Hershey defensemen in games played and ranked third in plus/minus with +8.\nWith the following 2020–21 season set to be delayed due to the ongoing pandemic, Alexeyev remained in Russia and was loaned by the Capitals to KHL club, Salavat Yulaev Ufa, on 4 September 2020. Alexeyev made his NHL debut on 29 December 2021 in a 5–3 win over the Nashville Predators.\nCareer statistics.\nRegular Season and playoffs.\n \n "

The back-and-forth battle between Belgians Toon Aerts and Wout van Aert in the elite men standings was decided in the favour of Aerts – with 615 points, to van Aert's 613; the two riders took three victories between them as van der Poel won all six races he started in the World Cup season, finishing third overall.\nPoints distribution.\nPoints were awarded to all eligible riders each race.

        "title": "List of FIFA World Cup stadiums",
        "text": "This article is regarding the stadiums used for FIFA World Cup.\nStadium requirements.\nFIFA has had strict stadium guideline requirements since at least 2001. Stadiums must have a capacity of at least 40,000, stadiums hosting quarter-finals or semi-finals must have a minimum of 60,000 and those hosting the opening ceremony or final must have a capacity of at least 80,000. In addition, stadiums must have a minimum number of television camera stands and media areas and also be free of advertising throughout the World Cup. This includes stadium names – for instance, during the 2006 World Cup, German stadiums such as Allianz Arena were renamed \"FIFA World Cup Stadium – Munich\" for licensing reasons.\nStadiums by tournament.\n1930.\nAll 1930 FIFA World Cup matches took place in Montevideo. Three stadiums were used: Estadio Centenario, Estadio Pocitos, and Estadio Parque Central. The Estadio Centenario was built both for the tournament and as a celebration of the centenary of Uruguayan independence. Designed by Juan Scasso, it was the primary stadium for the tournament, referred to by Rimet as a \"temple of football\". With a capacity of 90,000, it was the largest football stadium outside the British Isles. The stadium hosted 10 of the 18 matches, including both semi-finals and the final. However, a rushed construction schedule and delays caused by the rainy season meant the Centenario was not ready for use until five days into the tournament. Early matches were played at smaller stadiums usually used by Montevideo football clubs Nacional and Peñarol, the 20,000 capacity Parque Central and the Pocitos.\n1934.\nDuring the 1934 FIFA World Cup the number of supporters travelling from other countries was higher than at any previous football tournament, including 7,000 from the Netherlands and 10,000 each from Austria and Switzerland.\n1938.\nTen cities were planned to host the 1938 FIFA World Cup tournament; of these, all hosted matches except Lyon, which did not due to Austria's withdrawal.\n1950.\nSix venues in six cities around Brazil hosted the 22 matches played for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. The Maracanã in the then-capital of Rio de Janeiro hosted eight matches, including all but one of the host's matches, including the \"Maracanazo\" match in the second round robin group that decided the winners of the tournament. The Pacaembu stadium in São Paulo hosted six matches; these two stadiums in São Paulo and Rio were the only venues that hosted the second round robin matches. The Estádio Sete de Setembro in Belo Horizonte hosted three matches, the Durival de Britto stadium in Curitiba and the Eucaliptos stadium in Porto Alegre each hosted two matches, and the Ilha do Retiro stadium in far-away Recife only hosted one match.\n1954.\nSix venues in six cities (1 venue in each city) hosted the 1954 FIFA World Cup tournament's 26 matches. The most used stadium was the St. Jakob stadium in Basel, which hosted 6 matches. The venues in Bern, Zurich and Lausanne each hosted 5 matches, the venue in Geneva hosted 4 matches and the venue in Lugano only hosted 1 match.\n1958.\nA total of twelve cities throughout the central and southern parts of Sweden hosted the 1958 FIFA World Cup tournament. FIFA regulations required at least six stadiums to have a capacity of at least 20,000. If Denmark had qualified, the organisers had planned to use the Idrætsparken in Copenhagen for Denmark's group matches. The Idrætsparken was renovated in 1956 with this in mind, but Denmark lost out to England in qualification. When doubts arose about whether funding would be forthcoming for rebuilding the Ullevi and Malmö Stadion, the organisers considered stadiums in Copenhagen and Oslo as contingency measures.\nThe Rasunda Stadium was expanded from 38,000 for the World Cup by building end stands. Organising committee chairman Holger Bergérus mortgaged his house to pay for this. The new Malmö Stadion was built for the World Cup, replacing the 1896 Malmö Stadion at a new site The Idrottsparken had 4,709 seats added for the World Cup. The Social Democratic municipal government refused to pay for this until the organisers threatened to select Folkungavallen in Linköping instead. At the Rimnersvallen, a stand from the smaller Oddevallen stadium was moved to Rimnersvallen for the World Cup. The crowd at Brazil v. Austria was estimated at 21,000, with more looking in from the adjoining hillside. The most used stadium was the Rasunda Stadium in Stockholm, which hosted 8 matches including the final, followed by the Ullevi Stadium in Gothenburg (the biggest stadium used during the tournament), which hosted 7 matches.\n1962.\nOriginally, eight stadiums were selected to host the World Cup matches in eight different cities: Santiago, Viña del Mar, Rancagua, Arica, Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia.\nThe Valdivia earthquake, the most powerful earthquake ever recorded, occurred on 22 May 1960. With over 50,000 casualties and more than 2 million people affected, the earthquake forced the organising committee to completely modify the World Cup's calendar. Talca, Concepción, Talcahuano and Valdivia were severely damaged and discarded as venues. Antofagasta and Valparaíso declined to host any matches as their venues were not financially self-sustainable. Viña del Mar and Arica managed to rebuild their stadiums while Braden Copper Company, then an American company that controlled the El Teniente copper mine, allowed the use of its stadium in Rancagua. The most used stadium was the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, with 10 matches; the Estadio Sausalito in Viña del Mar hosted 8 matches, and the stadiums in Rancagua and far-away Arica (the only location that was not close to the other cities) both hosted 7 matches.\nBeing largely concerned with the build-up of the country after the 1960 earthquake, government support for the tournament was minimal.\n1966.\nEight venues were used for this World Cup. The newest and biggest venue used was Wembley Stadium in west London, which was 43 years old in 1966. As was often the case in the World Cup, group matches were played in two venues in close proximity to each other. Group 1 matches (which included the hosts) were all played in London: five at Wembley, which was England's national stadium and was considered to be the most important football venue in the world; and one at White City Stadium in west London, which was used as a temporary replacement for nearby Wembley. The group stage match between Uruguay and France played at White City Stadium (originally built for the 1908 Summer Olympics) was scheduled for a Friday, the same day as regularly scheduled greyhound racing at Wembley. Because Wembley's owner refused to cancel this, the game had to be moved to the alternative venue in London. Group 2's matches were played at Hillsborough Stadium in Sheffield and Villa Park in Birmingham; Group 3's matches were played at Old Trafford in Manchester and Goodison Park in Liverpool; and Group 4's matches were played at Ayresome Park in Middlesbrough and Roker Park in Sunderland.\nThe most used venue was Wembley, which was used for nine matches, including all six featuring England, the final and the third-place match. Goodison Park was used for five matches, Roker Park and Hillsborough both hosted four, while Old Trafford, Villa Park and Ayresome Park each hosted three matches and did not host any knockout round matches.\n1970.\nFive stadiums in five cities were selected to host the World Cup matches. Alternative venues in Hidalgo state and the port city of Veracruz were also considered. Each group was based solely in one city with exception of Group 2, which was staged in both Puebla and Toluca. Aside from the Estadio Luis Dosal, all the stadiums had only been constructed during the 1960s, as Mexico prepared to host both the World Cup and the 1968 Summer Olympics.\nThe altitude of the venues varied and the importance of acclimatisation was strongly considered by all the participating teams. As a result, in contrast to the previous tournament staged in England, most teams arrived in the region well in advance of their opening fixtures to prepare for this factor. Some teams had already experienced the local conditions when competing in the football competition at 1968 Summer Olympics. At an elevation in excess of above sea level, Toluca was the highest of the venues; Guadalajara was the lowest at .\nOf the five stadiums used for the 32 matches played, the largest and most used venue was the Azteca Stadium in Mexico City; which hosted ten total matches including the final and third place matches, and all of Group 1's matches (which included all of host Mexico's matches). The Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara hosted eight matches including all of Group 3's matches and a semi-final. The Nou Camp Stadium in Leon hosted seven matches, which consisted of all of Group 4's matches and a quarter-final match. The Luis Dosal stadium in Toluca hosted four matches, and Cuauhtémoc stadium in Puebla hosted three matches and was the only stadium of the five used for this tournament not to host any knockout rounds.\n1978.\nOf the 6 venues used, the Argentine national stadium, the Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires was the largest and most used venue, hosting 9 total matches, including the final match. The Carreras Stadium in Córdoba hosted 8 matches, the stadiums in Mendoza, Rosario and Mar del Plata each hosted 6 matches and the José Amalfitani Stadium in Buenos Aires hosted 3 matches. The Minella stadium in Mar del Plata was heavily criticized due to its terrible pitch, which was deemed \"nearly unplayable\"; whereas the Amalfitani stadium in Buenos Aires, the least used stadium for this tournament, was praised for its very good pitch.\nBrazil was forced by tournament organizers to play all three of its first group matches in Mar del Plata.\n1982.\n17 stadiums in 14 cities hosted the tournament, a record until the 2002 tournament which was hosted by 20 stadiums. The most used stadium was FC Barcelona's Camp Nou stadium which hosted 5 matches including a semi-final match; it was the largest stadium used for this tournament. In addition to Barcelona's Sarria Stadium hosting 3 total matches, Barcelona was the Spanish city with the most matches in Espana '82 with 8; the Spanish capital of Madrid followed with 7.\nThis particular World Cup was organised in such a way where all of the matches of each of the six groups of four were assigned stadiums in cities close in proximity to each other; reducing the stress of travel on the players and fans. For example: Group 1 only played in Vigo and A Coruña, Group 2 only played in Gijón and Oviedo, Group 3 only played in Elche and Alicante (except for the first match, which was the opening match of the tournament, which was played at the Camp Nou), Group 4 played only in Bilbao and Valladolid (England played all their first round group matches in Bilbao), Group 5 (which included hosts Spain) was played exclusively in Valencia and Zaragoza, and Group 6 played exclusively in Seville and Málaga (of the 3 1st round matches in Seville, the first match between Brazil and the USSR was played in the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, and the other two were played in the Villamarin Stadium).\nWhen the tournament went into the round-robin second round matches, all the aforementioned cities excluding Barcelona, Alicante and Seville did not host any more matches in Espana '82. Both the Santiago Bernabéu and Vicente Calderón stadiums in Madrid and the Sarria Stadium in Barcelona were used for the first time for this tournament for the second round matches. Madrid and Barcelona hosted the four second round group matches; Barcelona hosted Groups A and C (Camp Nou hosted all 3 of Group A's matches, and Sarria did the same with Group C's matches) and Madrid hosted Groups B and D (Real Madrid's Bernabeu Stadium hosted all 3 of Group B's matches, and Atlético Madrid's Calderon Stadium did the same with the Group D matches)\nThe two semi final matches were held at Camp Nou and the Pizjuan Stadium in Seville, the third largest stadium used for the tournament (one of only 2 Espana '82 matches it hosted), the third place match was held in Alicante and the final was held at the Bernabeu, the second largest stadium used for this tournament.\nSpain's hot summer climate was avoided by playing most matches in the late afternoon or at night; for instance Seville- which is one of the hottest cities in Europe, with June and July average temperatures going past the 90s Fahrenheit (32 Celsius)- could only play its matches at 21:00. During the group stages, all the southern coastal cities with their hot summer weather saw all their matches start at 21:00 local time; and the northern cities with their cooler weather had their matches start at 17:15 local time.\n1986.\nEleven cities hosted the tournament. The Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, the largest stadium used for the tournament, hosted 9 matches (including the final), more than any other stadium used. Mexico City hosted 13 total matches; the Olimpico Universitario Stadium hosted 4 matches (if the Mexico City suburban town Nezahualcoyotl's matches are included, this brings the total up to 16 matches). The Estadio Jalisco in Guadalajara hosted 7 matches, and the Estiado Cuauhtémoc in Puebla hosted 5 matches.\nThe hot and rainy summer weather in Mexico varied from desert locations like Monterrey to tropical locations such as Guadalajara; but perhaps the greatest hardship the players had to contend with was the high altitude of the Mexican locations. With the exception of Monterrey (still 2,000 feet above sea level), all of the stadiums were located in cities that varied anywhere from Guadalajara being above sea level to Toluca being above sea level- making conditions very difficult for the players running around in these stadiums. Mexico City, the location of the final match and the location where the most matches were played was above sea level.\nAll of these venues except Monterrey were located in central Mexico, as this tournament was organised with the then-standard way of keeping teams playing in locations in close proximity to each other. Group A only played at the Olimpico and in Puebla (except for the Bulgaria-Italy opening tournament match, which was played in the Azteca), Group B only played at the Azteca and in Toluca (hosts Mexico were drawn in this group; they played all their group stage matches at the Azteca), Group C played in León and Irapuato, Group D only played in Guadalajara (including the Guadalajara area town of Zapopan; the last match of this group was played in Monterrey), Group E exclusively played in Querétaro and Nezahualcóyotl, and Group F played in the northern city of Monterrey (including the Monterrey area town of San Nicolas de los Garza; the last match of this group was played in Guadalajara). All of the venues listed hosted knockout round matches except the ones in Nezahualcoyotl, Irapuato, Zapopan, Toluca and the Estadio Tecnológico in Monterrey.\n1990.\nTwelve stadiums were selected to host the World Cup matches in twelve different cities. The Stadio San Nicola in Bari and Turin's Stadio delle Alpi were completely new venues opened for the World Cup.\nThe remaining ten venues all underwent extensive programmes of improvements in preparation for the tournament, forcing many of the club tenants of the stadiums to move to temporary homes. Additional seating and roofs were added to most stadiums, with further redevelopments seeing running tracks removed and new pitches laid. Due to structural constraints, several of the existing stadiums had to be virtually rebuilt to implement the changes required.\nLike Espana '82, the group stage of this tournament was organized in such a way where specific groups only played in two cities close in proximity to each other. Group A only played in Rome and Florence (Hosts Italy played all their competitive matches in Rome, except for their semi-final and third place matches, which were played in Naples and Bari, respectively), Group B played their matches in Naples and Bari (except for Argentina vs. Cameroon, which was the opening match of the tournament, played in Milan), Group C played their matches in Turin and Genoa, Group D played all their matches in Milan and Bologna, Group E played only in Udine and Verona, and Group F played on the island cities of Cagliari and Palermo. The cities that hosted the most World Cup matches were the two biggest cities in Italy: Rome and Milan, each hosting six matches, and Bari, Naples and Turin each hosted five matches. Cagliari, Udine, and Palermo were the only cities of the 12 selected that did not host any knockout round matches. All matches, typical of a World Cup in Europe were played in the late afternoon or the evening to avoid the intense heat of an Italian summer.\nThe England national team, at the British government's request, were forced to play all their matches at Stadio Sant'Elia in Cagliari on the island of Sardinia. Hooliganism, rife in English football in the 1980s, had followed the national team while they played friendlies on the European continent – the distrust of English fans was so high that the English FA's reputation and even diplomatic relations between the U.K. and Italy were seen to be at risk if England played any group stage matches on the Italian mainland. Thanks largely to British Sports Minister Colin Moynihan's negative remarks about English fans weeks before the match, security around Cagliari during England's three matches there was extremely heavy – in addition to 7,000 local police and Carabineri, highly trained Italian military special forces were also there patrolling the premises. The Italian authorities' heavy presence proved to be justified as there were several riots during the time England were playing their matches in Cagliari, leading to a number of injuries, arrests and even deportations.\nMost of the construction cost in excess of their original estimates and total costs ended up being over £550 million (approximately $935 million). Rome's Stadio Olimpico which would host the final was the most expensive project overall, while Udine's Stadio Friuli, the newest of the existing stadiums (opened 14 years prior), cost the least to redevelop.\n1994.\nThe games were played in nine cities across the country. All stadiums had a capacity of at least 53,000, and their usual tenants were professional or college American football teams. The venue used most was the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, with eight games, among them one round of 16 match, a semi-final, the third-place game, and the final. The least used was the Pontiac Silverdome near Detroit, the first indoor stadium used in a World Cup, with four group stage games. The Pontiac Silverdome was also the only venue of the 9 used that did not host any knockout round matches.\nBecause of the large area of the continental United States, the match locations were often far apart. Some teams in Groups A and B had to travel from Los Angeles or San Francisco all the way to Detroit and back again, covering and three time zones one way. The teams in Groups C and D only played in Foxborough (Boston), Chicago and Dallas – a trip from Boston to Dallas is , but only covers one time zone; Chicago is in the same time zone as Dallas but is still away from both Dallas and Boston. The teams in Groups E and F's travel was a bit easier – they played exclusively in East Rutherford (New York City), Washington and Orlando. A few teams such as Cameroon and Italy did not have to travel great distances to cities to play matches.\nThe variety of climate in different cities all over the United States made playing conditions challenging; aside from the oceanic coolness of Boston (Foxborough), the Mediterranean climate of San Francisco (Stanford) and occasionally the coolness of Chicago, most matches were played in very hot and/or humid conditions. Although playing in the sometimes triple-digit dry heat and smoggy conditions of Los Angeles (Pasadena) and the intense mixture of heat and humidity of Washington and New York City (East Rutherford) proved to be difficult, the cities with the most oppressive conditions were the southern cities of Orlando and Dallas because of the combination of triple-digit heat and extreme humidity. The Floridian tropical climate of Orlando meant all matches there were played in temperatures of or above with humidity at 70% or more (the temperature there during the group stage match between Mexico and Ireland was ) thanks to the mid-day start times. Dallas was not much different: in the semi-arid heat of a Texas summer, temperatures exceeded during mid-day, when matches there were staged in the open-type Cotton Bowl meant that conditions were just as oppressive there as they were in Orlando. Detroit also proved to be difficult: the Pontiac Silverdome did not have a working cooling system and because it was an interior dome-shaped stadium, the air could not escape through circulation, so temperatures inside the stadium would climb past with 40% humidity. United States midfielder Thomas Dooley described the Silverdome as \"the worst place I have ever played at\".\n1998.\nFrance's bid to host the World Cup centered on a national stadium with 80,000 seats and nine other stadiums located across the country. When the finals were originally awarded in July 1992, none of the regional club grounds were of a capacity meeting FIFA's requirements – namely being able to safely seat 40,000. The proposed national stadium, colloquially referred to as the 'Grand stade' met with controversy at every stage of planning; the stadium's location was determined by politics, finance and national symbolism. As Mayor of Paris, Jacques Chirac successfully negotiated a deal with Prime Minister Édouard Balladur to bring the Stade de France – as it was named now, to the commune of Saint-Denis just north of the capital city. Construction on the stadium started in December 1995 and was completed after 26 months of work in November 1997 at a cost of ₣2.67 billion.\nThe choice of stadium locations was drafted from an original list of 14 cities. FIFA and CFO monitored the progress and quality of preparations, culminating in the former providing final checks of the grounds weeks before the tournament commenced. Montpellier was the surprise inclusion from the final list of cities because of its low urban hierarchy in comparison to Strasbourg, who boasted a better hierarchy and success from its local football team, having been taken over by a consortium. Montpellier however was considered ambitious by the selecting panel to host World Cup matches. The local city and regional authorities in particular had invested heavily into football the previous two decades and were able to measure economic effects, in terms of jobs as early as in 1997. Some of the venues used for this tournament were also used for the previous World Cup in France in 1938. The Stade Vélodrome in Marseille, the Parc Lescure in Bordeaux and the Parc des Princes in Paris received the honour of hosting World Cup matches once again in 1998 as they had all done in 1938.\n10 stadiums in total were used for the finals; in addition to nine matches being played at the Stade de France (the most used stadium in the tournament), a further six matches took place in Paris Saint-Germain's Parc des Princes, bringing Paris's total matches hosted to 15. France played four of their seven matches in the national stadium; they also played in the country's second and third largest cities, Marseille (hosting 7 total matches) and Lyon (hosting 6 total matches), as well as a Round of 16 knockout match in the northern city of Lens (also hosting 6 total matches). Nantes, Toulouse, Bordeaux, Montpellier and Saint-Étienne also hosted 6 matches in total; all of the stadiums used also hosted knockout round matches.\n2002.\nSouth Korea and Japan each provided 10 venues, the vast majority of them newly built for the tournament. Groups A-D played all their matches in South Korea, and Groups E-H played all their matches in Japan. The stadiums in Daegu, Suwon, Yokohama and Saitama all hosted 4 matches each, while the other 16 stadiums hosted 3 matches each. Notably, no matches were played in Tokyo, making it the first capital of a host country not to have a World Cup venue.\n2006.\nIn 2006, Germany had a plethora of football stadiums that satisfied FIFA's minimum capacity of 40,000 seats for World Cup matches. The still-standing Olympiastadion in Munich (69,250) was not used for the tournament, even though FIFA's regulations allow one city to use two stadiums. Düsseldorf's LTU Arena (51,500), Bremen's Weserstadion (43,000) and Mönchengladbach's Borussia-Park (46,249) were also not used.\nTwelve stadiums were selected to host the World Cup matches. During the tournament, many of them were known by different names, as FIFA prohibits sponsorship of stadiums unless the stadium sponsors are also official FIFA sponsors. For example, the Allianz Arena in Munich was known during the competition as \"FIFA World Cup Stadium, Munich\" (), and even the letters of the company Allianz were removed or covered. Some of the stadiums also had a lower capacity for the World Cup, as FIFA regulations ban standing room; nonetheless, this was accommodated as several stadiums had a UEFA five-star ranking. The stadiums in Berlin, Munich, Dortmund and Stuttgart hosted six matches each, while the other eight stadiums hosted five matches each.\n2010.\nIn 2005, the organisers released a provisional list of 13 venues to be used for the World Cup: Bloemfontein, Cape Town, Durban, Johannesburg (two venues), Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Nelspruit, Orkney, Polokwane, Port Elizabeth, Pretoria, and Rustenburg. This was narrowed down to the ten venues that were officially announced by FIFA on 17 March 2006.\nThe altitude of several venues affected the motion of the ball and player performance, although FIFA's medical chief downplayed this consideration. Six of the ten venues were over above sea level, with the two Johannesburg venues – the FNB Stadium (also known as Soccer City) and Ellis Park Stadium – the highest at approximately .\nThe FNB Stadium, the Cape Town Stadium and the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth were the most-used venues, each hosting eight matches. Ellis Park Stadium and the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban hosted seven matches each, while the Loftus Versfeld Stadium in Pretoria, the Free State Stadium in Bloemfontein and the Royal Bafokeng Stadium in Rustenburg hosted six matches each. The Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane and the Mbombela Stadium in Nelspruit hosted four matches each, but did not host any knockout-stage matches.\n2014.\n12 venues (seven new and five renovated) in twelve cities were selected for the tournament. The venues covered all the main regions of Brazil and created more evenly distributed hosting than the 1950 finals in Brazil. Consequently, the tournament required long-distance travel for teams. During the World Cup, Brazilian cities were also home to the participating teams at 32 separate base camps, as well as staging official fan fests where supporters could view the games.\nThe most-used stadiums were the Maracana and Brasília, which hosted 7 matches each. São Paulo, Fortaleza, Belo Horizonte and Salvador hosted 6 matches each, Porto Alegre and Recife hosted 5 matches each, and Cuiaba, Manaus, Natal and Curitiba hosted 4 matches each and being the 4 smallest stadiums used, the 4 aforementioned cities did not host any knockout rounds.\n2018.\nA total of twelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built and renovated for the FIFA World Cup.\n2022.\nThe first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadiums aimed to employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to , and the upper tiers of the stadiums were disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure. The country intended for the stadiums to reflect the historical and cultural aspects of Qatar. Each stadium incorporated four priorities, which were legacy, comfort, accessibility and sustainability. Qatar aimed to build the stadiums with the highest sustainability and environmental standards. The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that were environmentally friendly overcoming the challenging environmental nature of the country. The plan was to build Zero Waste stadiums using environmentally friendly materials, harmless equipment, and ecologically sustainable solutions through the implementation of renewable and low energy solutions. Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect Albert Speer &amp; Partners. Leading football clubs in Europe wanted the World Cup to take place from 28 April to 29 May rather than the typical June and July staging, due to concerns about the heat.\nA report released on 9 December 2010 quoted FIFA President Sepp Blatter as stating that other nations could host some matches during the World Cup. However, no specific countries were named in the report. Blatter added that any such decision must be taken by Qatar first and then endorsed by FIFA's executive committee. Prince Ali bin Al Hussein of Jordan told the Australian Associated Press that holding games in Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, and possibly Saudi Arabia would help to incorporate the people of the region during the tournament.\nAccording to a report released in April 2013 by Merrill Lynch, the investment banking division of Bank of America, the organisers in Qatar requested FIFA to approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs. Bloomberg.com said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.\nIn April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have ready in five years' time, however Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery &amp; Legacy said it expected there would be eight.\nIn January 2019, Infantino said that FIFA was exploring the possibility of having neighbouring countries host matches during the tournament, in order to reduce political tensions.\n2026.\nOn 16 June 2022, FIFA selected 16 venues to host the 2026 FIFA World Cup (two in Canada, three in Mexico and 11 in the United States). The venues were separated by three geographical divisions: Vancouver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Guadalajara in the Western Division, Kansas City, Dallas, Houston, Atlanta, Monterrey and Mexico City in the Central Division and Toronto, Boston, New York City, Philadelphia and Miami in the Eastern Division\nBoston, Dallas, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, which hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, were chosen, though often with different stadiums. Atlanta, Houston, Kansas City, Miami, Philadelphia and Seattle were new venues. The Estadio Azteca will host the FIFA World Cup for the third time in its history."

The tournament was held from 12 to 28 May 2023, organized by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF).\nAs in the 2022 edition, the tournament saw several upsets: Kazakhstan's win over Norway, Hungary's win over France, Latvia's first-ever victory over Czechia, Norway’s second-ever win over Canada, as well as Kazakhstan's first-ever victory over Slovakia. The playoffs also saw major upsets, as Latvia reached the semi-finals for the first time after defeating favourite Sweden 3–1 in the quarter-finals, Germany upset Switzerland 3–1 and the reigning Olympic and World Champion Finland lost to Canada 4–1. Czechia finished in 8th place after losing to the United States (USA) 3–0 in the quarter-finals, which is that nation's worst placement to date in the history of the World Championship. Germany reached the final for the first time since 1930 after upsetting the top-seeded USA 4–3 in overtime.\nCanada won its 28th title by beating Germany 5–2 in the final. The silver was Germany's first medal since 1953. Latvia claimed its first ever IIHF medal after defeating the USA 4–3 in overtime and finishing third.\nHost nation bid.\nThe event was originally planned to be held in Saint Petersburg, Russia, but, in February 2022, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) called for Russia and Belarus to be stripped of hosting rights to all international sporting events due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. On 26 April 2022, Russia lost their rights to host the World Championship.\nAfter being promoted to the top division, Slovenia and Hungary bid to co-host the event in Ljubljana and Budapest. The bid was withdrawn due to Hungarian Ice Hockey Federation informing the IIHF that it did not receive the governmental guarantees to host. Finland and Latvia submitted a joint bid, with Nokia Arena in Tampere and Arena Riga in Riga as potential host venues. On 27 May 2022, the IIHF confirmed that Finland and Latvia would host the tournament, with Finland having also hosted the 2022 IIHF World Championship in Tampere (Nokia Arena) and Helsinki (Helsinki Ice Hall).\nSeeding.\nThe seedings in the preliminary round are based on the 2022 IIHF World Ranking, as of the end of the 2022 IIHF World Championship, using the serpentine system while allowing the organizer, \"to allocate a maximum of two teams to separate groups.\"\nRosters.\nEach team's roster consists of at least 15 skaters (forwards, and defencemen) and 2 goaltenders, and at most 22 skaters and 3 goaltenders.

        "text": "Liam Kirk (born 3 January 2000) is a British professional ice hockey left winger currently playing under contract with HC Litvínov of the Czech Extraliga (ELH). Kirk began his career with the British Elite Ice Hockey League club the Sheffield Steelers.\nInternationally, Kirk has played for the British national team, helping them win promotion to the Elite Division at the 2018 IIHF World Championship Division I tournament, before playing an important role in the 2021 World Championship.\nIn June 2018, Kirk was drafted in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft by the Arizona Coyotes, becoming the first player born and trained in England to be selected by an NHL team.\nPlaying career.\nSheffield Steelers.\nGrowing up in Maltby, a small former mining town in South Yorkshire, Kirk first got into hockey when his parents and family went to watch the Sheffield Steelers. His brother Jonathan got into ice hockey and Kirk wanted to be like his brother, so he also started playing.\nKirk began playing for the Sheffield Junior Academy. He was selected for the Midlands Conference – a team consisting of the best players from the Midlands region of the UK at U11, U13, U15 and U17 level – every year of eligibility, winning the EIHA Conference Tournament twice and being named a tournament all-star six times out of a possible eight, as well as being named tournament MVP three times.\nPlaying in the England U18 North League in the 2015–16 season, Kirk amassed a league-leading 98 points, with 60 goals and 38 assists. The same year, the U18 team from Sheffield won the league title. He was also selected for the Great Britain U16s.\nContinuing his success as an U18, Kirk played in the EPL for the Sheffield Steeldogs (league now defunct) and was signed by the Sheffield Steelers on a three-year apprentice contract.\nJunior.\nKirk was selected 189th overall (in the 7th Round) in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft by the Arizona Coyotes. He became the first player born and trained in England to be drafted into the NHL. Kirk was selected 8th overall in the CHL Import Draft later in June and played for the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL).\nEuropean loan spells.\nWith the 2020–21 OHL season not scheduled to begin until December 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Kirk opted to remain in Europe initially signing a loan for Swedish Hockeyettan side Hanhals IF on a short-term deal on 17 October 2020. \nIn February 2021, Kirk temporarily returned to the UK by signing on loan with NIHL side Sheffield Steeldogs ahead of their Spring Cup series. In March 2021, Kirk was named as part of the Sheffield Steelers squad for the 2021 'Elite Series'.\nArizona Coyotes.\nOn 18 June 2021, Kirk signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Coyotes. On 28 July 2021, the Coyotes officially announced Kirk was signed to a three-year, entry-level contract with the club, becoming the first English born and trained player to sign an NHL contract.\nHe started the 2021–22 season in the AHL with the Coyotes' affiliate, the Tucson Roadrunners. Kirk played in eight matches, scoring two goals and three points, before suffering a season-ending knee injury in November 2021.\nReturning to health for the 2022–23 season, Kirk continued his tenure in the AHL with the Tucson Roadrunners. Serving as a healthy scratch and featuring in just a solitary game with the Roadrunners, Kirk was re-assigned by the Coyotes to secondary affiliate, the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL. Kirk registered 5 goals and 11 points through 15 games with the Gladiators before accepting a loan assignment from the Coyotes to return to Europe in joining Finnish top flight club, Mikkelin Jukurit of the Liiga, for the remainder of the season on 29 December 2022. \nReturn to Europe.\nOn 6 September 2023, Kirk was placed on unconditional waivers by the Coyotes for the purposes of contract termination. It was subsequently announced that Kirk signed with Litvínov in the Czech Extraliga. Kirk had played previously as a left winger but found success as a goalscorer when moved to play as a center on Litvínov's third line. During the season Kirk would go on to play on the second and first lines, along with the team's powerplay unit. In the 2023 - 2024 playoffs, Kirk led Litvínov in both goals and points, taking them to the semi-finals for the first time since the 2014 - 2015 season. He ended the season breaking the record for most goals scored by a Litvínov player in the playoffs &amp; eclipsed the top scorer in the playoffs over the last 3 years. \nInternational play.\nKirk has played for the British national team in several international tournaments at both the junior and senior level.\nIn the 2017–18 season, he played for the U18s, coming away with a gold medal. For the U20s, he collected a range of awards such as Best Forward, Most Points, Most Assists, Most Goals, as well as the Best Face-off Percentage (71.43%) and a bronze medal.\nHis senior debut came at the 2018 IIHF World Championship Division I, where he helped Great Britain earn promotion to the 2019 World Championship. It marked Great Britain's first appearance in the elite division since 1994. Kirk played five games, though he did not score a point.\nTwo years later, Kirk starred for Great Britain at the 2021 IIHF World Championship - scoring his first senior points and going on to finish joint-top of the goalscoring charts with seven goals in seven matches. \nKirk, who finished with nine points to his name, also helped Great Britain to a first regulation time win at the elite level since 1962 with a 4-3 win over Belarus on 26 May 2021, and an overall team points tally of four. He was named in the all-star team for his performance."

        "title": "1897 Metropolitan Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1897 Metropolitan Rugby Union season was the 24th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. Six clubs competed from May till September 1897. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Randwick who were undefeated during the season. Randwick were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table. This was the first premiership run under the new Metropolitan Rugby Football Union.\nTeams.\nSix clubs signed up with the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union to play the Senior Premiership. Each of the teams had participated in the premiership previously. The Paddington club had been disqualified from the competition at the end of the previous season due to unpaid Union fees. As a result, the club was newly formed at the beginning of the season. Paddington kept the identity and the history of the former club.\nSeason summary.\nEarly in the 1897, at the annual meeting for the New South Wales Rugby Football Union, a motion was passed to form a branch union to take over the running of club football. This new union was named the Metropolitan Rugby Football Union.\nThere was some discussion about the quality of play that football was producing in 1897. Some quarters declared that the standard had deteriorated over the past few seasons. However, it was suggested by others in the media that football was moving from individual heroics to team brilliance. The addition of talented players from the Junior ranks was welcomed with many of these players selected for representative honours.\nThe 1897 Sydney Rugby Premiership saw Randwick Football Club present its best performance to take all before it. The club were undefeated in all games during the season and won all three main awards, the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy, Agricultural Society Trophy and the Premiership. Unfortunately, the Agricultural Society Trophy was stripped from the club and awarded to their opponents due to a technicality. Before playing the semi-final, Randwick requested to allow the New Zealander, Tom Pauling, to play for the team. The Union allowed him to play but, due to a protest by the Pirates after the completion of the final, the decision was revised. With the new decision, the Pirates were awarded the Agricultural Society Trophy.\nAfter the introduction of new Juniors to the team, the Pirates Football Club transformed their season. During the previous season, the team failed to win a single game and began the new year with a pair of losses. With the arrival of Conlon, Boyd, Evers, McMahon, Ellis, Warman and Baird the team displayed improved form only slightly below that of the Premiers. The team were present in both trophy finals and finished the season runners-up. After the protest against Randwick was upheld, the Pirates were awarded with the Agricultural Society Trophy. Hopes were high for the future.\nThe two older clubs, Sydney University and Wallaroo, experienced less than their usual success during the season. Both teams were in the middle of a rebuilding phase, with older and more experienced players retiring from the game. New young blood was filtering into the ranks with hope that the clubs would soon be back to their high-class best. The 'Varsity displayed an upturn in their performance from previous seasons, giving the club promise for the future. Victory over the Pirates and an excellent game against the Premiers were the highlights of the season. Wallaroo experienced their worst season for a decade. This could be attributed to the injuries to key players, Row and Kelly. The team won only two games during the season and were unable to recruit Juniors of merit. With an infusion of new blood mixing with the sound, experienced players, it is believed that Wallaroo could achieve success once again.\nTrophy finals.\nFinals Week 1, 19 June &amp; 17 July.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nThe top four teams on the ladder qualified to compete for the Sydney Cricket Ground Trophy. Games were decided by draw with Wentworth and the Pirates facing off for the second successive week. This game ended with a 3 all draw and was replayed on 17 July. In the replay, the Pirates won easily 17 points to 6. In the second semi, Randwick had the better team resulting in a loss for Wallaroo 17 to 3.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nAfter missing out on playing for the SCG Trophy, the Sydney University Football Club still qualified for the Agricultural Society Trophy. As no other teams were still in existence to contend for the trophy, University proceeded directly to the next week of finals.\nFinals Week 2, 24 July &amp; 7 August.\nSydney Cricket Ground Trophy.\nThere was much anticipation for the final, as many believed that the Pirates were the only club to end Randwick's unbeaten run. With the game played on a wet and muddy day, the result was almost what the crowd wanted. The ground was in such poor condition that the referee took a turn in the mud and humorously wore a muddy stain to show for it. The Pirates played a stronger wet-weather game and were able to hold Randwick to a nil all draw.\nThe replay final saw similar cold and squally weather. Despite the conditions, the game was commended for its fine display with both teams playing well. The score was 3 all at half time with Randwick eventually coming away as winners. The fact that Randwick did not score more points was due to the excellent defence of their opponents. Overall, the victors were the better team.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe Wentworth club continued their slow decline from the highs of the previous season. After losing three out of their last four games, several fresh players were brought in to compete against the 'Varsity. For the first 15 to 20 minutes of the game, the two teams were equal. After that, University played with greater 'life' to win the game and progress. Wallaroo were awarded a bye and progressed into the semi-finals.\nFinals Week 3, 28 August.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nMuch of the brightness had disappeared by the time of the semi-finals. Representative duties robbed the games of the finest players, with the two semi finals being played at the inconveniently distant Kensington Racecourse. Even with a weak team, Randwick were able to defeat a lacklustre University 24 to 3. The second semi saw a more even contest between the Pirates and Wallaroo. The game was closely fought until the eventual victors were able to take the lead near the end of the match.\nFinals Week 4, 28 August.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nPrior to the final being played, the Metropolitan Rugby Union reversed their decision to allow the New Zealander, Tom Pauling, to play for Randwick. However, the eventual Premiers were determined to include him in their squad. As a result, there was much ill feeling from the Pirates towards Randwick. This manifested itself in the game with players being called to explain their actions at a later hearing. Both teams were missing players due to representative duties which gave the crowd much hope for a Pirates victory. Eventually, Randwick were victorious, being more able to penetrate the defence of the opposition and make every play count. After the game, the Union made the decision to strip Randwick of the trophy and award it to the Pirates.\nLower grades.\nThe MRFU also conducted three junior competitions: First Juniors, Second Juniors, Third Juniors and Fourth Juniors.\nFirst Juniors.\nTen clubs signed up for First Juniors.

        "text": "Patrick Joseph Bourke Crowley (20 October 1923 – 9 June 1981) was a New Zealand rugby union player. A flanker, Crowley represented Auckland at a provincial level, and was a member of the New Zealand national rugby union team, from 1949 to 1950.\nCareer.\nAt the age of 19, Crowley made his first class debut for an army division team in 1943. He then went on to represent Auckland from 1946 to 1950, making thirty-four appearances for the provincial side. In his first season with Auckland, he would also play for the North Island team in the annual North vs South rugby union match. Crowley played for the North Island every year afterward, apart from 1949.\nHis performances saw him being called up for the national side, making his debut for the All Blacks during their tour of South Africa in 1949. The following year, he was part of the squad to face the British Lions in their tour of New Zealand and Australia. In an interview with \"The Scotsman\", Angus Black was complimentary of the flanker, recalling: \"Crowley was very good. I spent most of my day getting tackled hard. I was up in the air more often than I was on the ground. Crowley sorted us all out.\" The third test was to be Crowley's career defining performance as an All Black. Due to injuries, New Zealand had to play much of the match with six forwards, and Crowley ended having to do the work of two men instead of one. Crowley scored two tries against the Lions, the first was in the second test, and the second was when he was playing for Auckland.\nCrowley retired from rugby union later that year at the age of 26, having played sixty-four first class matches.\nPersonal life.\nCrowley was the grandfather of professional wrestler Cheree Crowley, better known by the ring names Evie and Dakota Kai."

        "title": "1886 Southern Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1886 Southern Rugby Football Union season was the 13th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the fourth competition for the Gardiner Challenge Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season was from May till September 1886. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Gordon who were newly formed at the beginning of the year. Gordon were crowned premiers by a committee of the Union.\nTeams.\nFor the 1886 season, the Union decided to elevate 5 Junior clubs into the senior competition. Albion, Balmain Wellington, Glebe, Parramatta and Rosedale had performed well during the previous season. In addition, they also included 3 regional clubs from Newcastle, Bathurst and Goulburn. These clubs had successfully competed against metropolitan clubs prior to their admission. A new club, exclusively for New Zealand players, was formed and successfully petitioned to be included in the senior competition. This club took on the name Gordon. Many of their players had competed previously for other clubs. After poor performance during the previous season, the St. Leonards club was not reformed and thus did not participate in the Gardiner Challenge Cup.\nRule Changes.\nWith the addition of regional clubs and the promotion of junior clubs, the Sydney Rugby Premiership saw sixteen teams compete for the Gardiner Challenge Cup. This increase in teams competing for the cup caused many of the senior clubs to limit their games to only those which would count towards the final results. Previous competitions between junior and senior clubs were thus rare. Growing crowd numbers saw games moving from the open Moore Park to more enclosed fields. The Royal Agricultural Society of NSW arranged for three fields to be available upon their grounds, however the third area was of poor quality. The Association Cricket Ground was made available from July.\nSeason Summary.\nIn their first season of football, the Gordon Football Club performed well against the more established senior clubs. In fifteen games, the club was only defeated once by the Balmain team. Amongst their victories during the season, Gordon had defeated Sydney University, Redfern, Burwood and Wallaroo who were amongst the best teams. Much of their success was attributed to their captain, James O'Donnell. At the conclusion of the season a committee of the union awarded Gordon the premiership with Sydney University recognised as coming second.\nIn 1885, Balmain Wellington had been the premier junior club. Now in the senior ranks, the club performed well displaying improvement as the season progressed. Many of their games were played on inferior grounds with the club not once playing on the Association Cricket Ground. the club had the benefit of all of their players remaining fit for the entire season. Their game against Gordon was a highlight of the year.\nThe new regional clubs that had been added to the premiership only played a handful of games. At a meeting of the Union in September, it was suggested that branch unions be formed in the Newcastle, Bathurst and Goulburn regions to deal with disputes.\nLower Grades.\nIn 1886, a Sydney businessman donated a cup for the development of a Junior Rugby Football competition. The MacGregor Junior Challenge Cup was open to clubs not participating in the senior competition. Fifteen clubs submitted applications to enter the competition. The competition was due to begin May 24 and run each Saturday until August 1. Each club was balloted with a game for each weekend. It was planned that the best 8 clubs would then be matched up with another ballot. The final for the MacGregor Cup occurred on 4th September between Oxford and Randwick. Oxford won the match 5 points to nil to win the cup.\nRepresentative Games.\nIntercolonial Matches.\nIn late July, the Gardiner Cup took a break in order to play two matches against a visiting Queensland team. When the visitors arrived in Sydney, it was obvious that they were far larger and heavier than the local players. The first match saw showers, making the ground and ball slippery. During the game, when the play was of a more tight nature, the Queenslanders were dominate. However once the play moved into being more open, the two teams were more equal. In the end an exciting game saw Queensland victors 4 points to 2. After making some changes for the second match, New South Wales were superior to the Queensland team winning the match 26 points to 5.\nThe New South Wales Tour of New Zealand.\nIn 1886 a team of New South Wales players were chosen and sent to New Zealand to play a number of matches against the local teams. The NSW team departed Sydney at the conclusion of the Gardiner Cup. No games were scheduled to play against a New Zealand team with games being against only local clubs. Unfortunately, the tourists did not fare well with a number of disappointing results. The merit of sending a team of young and inexperienced players was questioned and it was hoped that the results would not cause opposing teams to not value the New South Wales rugby players."

The tour started with two of the T20I matches played at the Central Broward Regional Park in Lauderhill, Florida. The Test series formed part of the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship. The fixtures were confirmed in June 2019.\nIn February 2019, Chris Gayle announced his retirement from ODI cricket, and he last played in a Test match in September 2014, against Bangladesh. However, in June 2019, during the Cricket World Cup, Gayle expressed his desire to play in the ODI matches for the West Indies, and possibly a Test match as well. In July 2019, Cricket West Indies named the ODI squad for the series, with Gayle included in the team. India's MS Dhoni elected to miss the tour to serve with his army regiment, and Hardik Pandya was rested for the series.\nIndia won the T20I series 3–0. In the second ODI, Chris Gayle became the first West Indian cricketer to play in 300 ODI matches. It was his 297th ODI for the West Indies, with Gayle also playing three ODIs for the ICC World XI team. In the same match, Gayle also became the leading run-scorer for a West Indies batsman in ODI cricket. He went past Brian Lara's record of 10,348 runs. India won the ODI series 2–0, after the first match finished as a no result.\nIndia won the Test series 2–0. The second match was Virat Kohli's 28th win as captain of India, becoming the most successful captain of India in Test cricket.\nSquads.\nAhead of the tour, Andre Russell ruled himself out of the West Indies' T20I squad and was replaced by Jason Mohammed. Fabian Allen was added to the West Indies' squad for the third T20I match, replacing Khary Pierre. Keemo Paul was ruled out of the first Test for the West Indies, with Miguel Cummins named as his replacement. For the second Test, Keemo Paul recovered from his injury, returning to the West Indies' squad, replacing Cummins. Jahmar Hamilton was added to the West Indies' squad for the second Test, replacing Shane Dowrich, who had an ankle injury.\nIn the second innings of the second Test, Jermaine Blackwood replaced Darren Bravo as a concussion substitute in the West Indies' squad."

        "text": "The 2018 World Para Athletics European Championships was a track and field competition for athletes with a disability open to International Paralympic Committee (IPC) affiliated countries within Europe, plus Azerbaijan and Israel. It was held in Berlin, Germany and took place between 20 and 26 August 2018 at the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark. 596 athletes from 35 countries competed during the championships.\nFormerly the IPC Athletics European Championships, this was the first edition of the championships since IPC undertook a rebrand of all sports for which they are the governing body, including the 'World Para' title for the committees running each sport. IPC Athletics was rebranded World Para Athletics in 2016; its first World Para Athletics Championships were held in 2017, and the European Championships followed suit in 2018.\nRussia were unable to compete due to their ongoing suspension from IPC and World Para Athletics. Poland topped the medal table.\nVenue.\nThe venue for the Championships was the Friedrich-Ludwig-Jahn-Sportpark athletics stadium in the Northeast of Berlin.\nFormat.\nThe 2018 World Para Athletics European Championships was an invitational championships for track and field events. No combined sports were included and not all events were open to all classifications, no events were contested between classifications.\nAthletes who came in first place were awarded the gold medal, second place the silver medal and third place the bronze. If only three competitors were declared to compete in an event then no bronze medal was awarded. Some events were classed as 'no medal' events.\nEvents.\nClassification.\nTo ensure competition is as fair and balanced as possible, athletes are classified dependent on how their disability impacts on their chosen event/s. Thus athletes may compete in an event against competitors with a different disability to themselves. Where there are more than one classification in one event, (for example discus throw F54/55/56), a points system is used to determine the winner. RaceRunning, an event using adapted tricycle frames for athletes with a severe balance impairment, was introduced for the first time in the RR category, while 'blade' athletes, using a prosthetic specialist limb were placed in new *61-4 categories, while athletes with lower limb disabilities, but not amputations, remained in the *42-4 categories.\nSummary.\n36 athletes won two gold medals or more at the event, while the seven listed below won 3 golds or more. Pierre Fairbank of France, with 4 gold medals, was the most successful athlete at the event, with Diana Dadzite of Latvia and Sophie Hahn of Great Britain the most successful female athletes with 3 gold medals.\nThe most successful home athletes were Felix Streng and Johannes Floors, with three gold and one silver medal each.\nAlexandra Helbling of Switzerland won 5 medals, a gold, 3 silvers and a bronze, the most medals of any athlete at the event.\nBroken records.\n15 World Records were broken in total across all events, with a further 9 European records also falling. Lucyna Kornobys of Poland was the only athlete to break two world records, setting new marks in the women's javelin F33 and shot put F33. Markus Rehm of Germany broke his own world record in the long jump T64 with a distance of 8.48 - a distance that would have won the able bodied event a few weeks earlier.\nMedal table.\nIn a number of events not all medals were awarded, due to field sizes or tied medals. In addition, a small number of rces were deemed 'non-medal' events, and are therefore not included in the final medal table.\nParticipating nations.\nBelow is the list of countries who participated in the Championships. were unable to take part due to their ongoing suspension from the IPC."

        "title": "Derek Holmes (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Derek Holmes (born August 15, 1939) is a Canadian retired ice hockey player, coach, administrator, and agent. He served as captain of the Eastern Canadian national team during the late 1960s, and was the technical director of Hockey Canada from 1974 to 1980. He managed the Canadian national teams at the 1977 and 1978 World Ice Hockey Championships, and helped build the 1980 Winter Olympics team. Holmes spent many years on the international ice hockey stage, which included being head coach of Team Finland and Team Switzerland, and later as an international ice hockey agent signing many players to European teams. He was inducted into the builder category of the IIHF Hall of Fame in 1999, the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame in 2021, and is a double inductee into the Kemptville District Sports Hall of Fame.\nPlayer and coach.\nHolmes was born in Kemptville, Ontario, on August 15, 1939. He played primarily as a centre, and had a right-hand shot. He played minor ice hockey locally in Kemptville, then joined the Kemptville Royals at age 15, and later won a Citizen Shield with the team in 1957. Holmes played junior ice hockey for the Ottawa Shamrocks, and the Toronto St. Michael's Majors. While playing for the Majors, he attended St. Michael's College School. At age 19, Holmes chose to leave the Majors, and play in Europe.\nHolmes played for the Wembley Lions of the British National League during the 1959–60 season. He commented that \"it was the best thing that ever happened to me\". He later coached a club team in Finland, and was head coach of the Finland men's national ice hockey team for the 1961 World Ice Hockey Championships. Finland had 1 win, 1 tie, and 5 losses, placing seventh overall.\nHolmes began the 1962–63 season on the Windsor Bulldogs in the OHA Senior A League, then finished with the Kemptville-Prescott Combines team in the Ottawa District Hockey Association (ODHA). The team shared home games between Kemptville and Prescott, and won the ODHA Senior A championship in a three-game sweep versus the Ottawa Montagnards. Holmes was captain of this team which reached the Eastern Canada quarterfinals for the 1963 Allan Cup.\nHolmes returned to Europe between 1963 and 1966, playing for EC Kitzbühel in Austria, HC La Chaux-de-Fonds, EV Zug, and HC Ambrì-Piotta in Switzerland; was the most valuable player during the 1965 Spengler Cup tournament, and won a championship in the Swiss National League. During these years, he spent time as a player-coach for the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team, and the Austria men's national ice hockey team.\nHolmes returned to Canada again, and played senior hockey in Morrisburg during the 1966–67 season. He then joined the Canada men's national ice hockey team, when it was divided into western and eastern branches. Holmes played for head Jack Bownass, and was named captain of the Eastern National Team. He played three season for the Eastern National team from 1967 to 1970, but did not play in the 1968 Winter Olympics due to a knee injury, and later graduated from Carleton University with a degree in history.\nHolmes also played senior ice hockey for the Ottawa Nationals during the 1968–69 season, and his final year as a player was the 1969–70 season, playing for the Rochester Junior Americans, and the Syracuse Stars. Holmes was head coach of the Switzerland men's national ice hockey team at the 1972 World Ice Hockey Championships, and the 1972 Winter Olympics. He returned to Canada and coached the Ottawa M and W Rangers team in the Central Canada Hockey League during the 1972–73 season, which included future International Ice Hockey Federation medical officer, Mark Aubry. The Rangers finished the season with 30 wins and 5 ties, in 55 games played.\nHockey Canada.\nHolmes was recruited by Doug Fisher and Lou Lefaive while he was coaching Switzerland at the 1972 World Ice Hockey Championships, to become a full-time employee for Hockey Canada. He began working for Hockey Canada in April 1974, and said its purpose was to \"beat the Russians\". He served as the technical director from 1974 to 1980, and summarized his work with Hockey Canada as being a project coordinator, administrator, and scouting Team Canada players for the Ice Hockey World Championships, and the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nHockey Canada reorganized its structure in July 1976, and Holmes' title was executive secretary-treasurer at the time. Holmes scouted the competition at the 1976 Ice Hockey World Championships, and predicted that no country would dominate the upcoming 1976 Canada Cup. He later felt that Team Canada was favoured, on a team assembled by Sam Pollock. Holmes said that reestablishing the Canadian Olympic hockey team became more likely, due to the 1976 Canada Cup allowing best-on-best competition for Canada. The Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union proposed developing a university team for the 1980 Winter Olympics, but Holmes thought that it would exclude deserving junior ice hockey players. Holmes supported Father David Bauer being put in charge of a committee for selecting a team for the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nHockey Canada selected Holmes as the committee chairman for the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships team. The event was to be Canada's return to the Ice Hockey World Championships since its withdrawal from international play in 1970, and he anticipated using National Hockey League (NHL) and World Hockey Association (WHA) players whose teams had been eliminated from the playoffs. He and assistant Bill Watters compiled the tournament roster. Holmes said that Canadians had low expectations for the national team at the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships, and \"I think there are a lot of awfully good hockey players who never got a chance to play on a Team Canada.\"\nHe searched for a coach that would bring new ideas to the team, possibly an amateur or college coach. Johnny Wilson was later appointed coach of Team Canada. Holmes served as an assistant coach to Wilson, along with Phil Esposito. He stressed that Canada needed to be disciplined on the ice, due to the lengthy trip, roster size, and style of international play. After a fourth-place finished at the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships, Holmes said the team was not disciplined enough, and that roster limitations prevented Team Canada from replacing those players. He recommended going back to a permanent national team similar to Father Bauer's team in the 1960s.\nHolmes and Watters resumed the same roles in managing the 1978 World Ice Hockey Championships team. Holmes spent extensive time scouting the opposition teams between championships. They aimed for a more disciplined team for international play. In 1978, he had difficulties getting commitments from players for the national team, since the NHL and the WHA were signing players to minor league contracts, instead of allowing them to play internationally. Holmes stated that European countries began to have the same difficulty as Canada, due to professionals being unavailable due to NHL and WHA schedules. Holmes served as an assistant coach again for the 1978 World Ice Hockey Championships. Canada improved to a third-place finish in 1978.\nHolmes attended tryouts for Team Canada at the 1980 Winter Olympics in the summer of 1978, working with Father Bauer and Georges Larivière to build a team. Holmes' plan for the national program was to make a junior team for the World Juniors, and a senior team for other tournaments. He assessed played on self-discipline, and characters, looked for more innovative coaching techniques. He selected 65 players from those available at the junior, senior, and college levels, and those playing in Europe as amateurs, for further evaluation. He also considered asking NHL and WHA teams to assign draft picks to Team Canada, rather than being signed to minor league contracts. The team played exhibition games versus NHL and WHA teams, and international tournaments including the Izvestia Cup. Canada finished sixth-place in ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics.\nIn January 1980, Lou Lefaive became president of Hockey Canada, which lessened administrative duties from Holmes who then focused on technical director duties. Holmes resigned his position on March 31, 1980, without giving a reason. Author William Houston speculated that Holmes had grown tired of working with Alan Eagleson. Holmes said later in an interview, that Eagleson never felt his actions were wrong, that he could do anything he wanted regardless of the opinions of others, and took credit where it wasn't due. Holmes was at the Hotel International Prague during the 1972 World Ice Hockey Championships, and said that Eagleson did not take part in the 1972 Summit Series negotiations, and was actually told to mind his own business.\nPlayer agent.\nHolmes became an international ice hockey player agent after leaving Hockey Canada, and by May 1980 he had helped over 40 players sign contracts in Europe since the merger of the World Hockey Association and the National Hockey League in 1979. Holmes expected the number of Canadians playing in Europe would continue to increase, until teams reached the league regulations which limit the number of imports to two players per team. Holmes used his worldwide connections to find a contract for Garry Monahan with contract in Japan, and negotiated a tentative deal for Denis Potvin to play in Europe.\nOther notable clients of Holmes have included, Fran Huck, Dale McCourt, Rick Middleton, Morris Mott, Danny O'Shea, and Kevin O'Shea. Holmes was contacted by the planned Global Hockey League in 1990 to be an associated player agent, but he declined stating that it was poorly planned, and he would not represent Canadians in the league.\nHonours and awards.\nDuring his career, Holmes was involved in the national teams for Canada, Finland, Switzerland and Austria, and while with Hockey Canada, he supported Chinese players seeking experience in Canada. In 1999, Holmes was inducted into IIHF Hall of Fame in the builder category. He was inducted into Kemptville District Sports Hall of Fame as an individual sportsman in 2012, and then inducted a second time in 2017, as a member of the 1962–63 Kemptville-Prescott Combines hockey team. In 2021, he was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame."

        "title": "2019 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2019 Ashes series (officially the Specsavers Ashes Series for sponsorship reasons) was a series of Test cricket matches played between England and Australia for The Ashes in August and September 2019. The venues were Edgbaston, Lord's, Headingley, Old Trafford and The Oval. \nAustralia were the defending holders of the Ashes going into the series, having won in 2017–18. The series was the first in the inaugural 2019–2021 ICC World Test Championship.\nThe series was drawn 2–2. Australia won the first Test decisively to gain a 1–0 series lead. This was followed by a tense draw in the second Test, where a concussion substitute was used for the first time in international cricket. England then levelled the series 1–1 with a narrow win in the third Test. Australia fought back to gain a 2–1 series lead after winning the fourth Test, retaining the Ashes for the first time since 2001. However, England levelled the series with a comfortable victory in the fifth Test, resulting in the first drawn Ashes series since 1972.\nSteve Smith’s phenomenal series total of 774 runs at an average of 110.54 has been lauded as one of the best batting performances of all time. Ben Stokes' match-winning 135* in the third Test also received recognition as one of the best Test innings of all time.\nBackground.\nThe 2019 Ashes series began with Australia leading England by 33 series to 32, with five drawn series. Australia had won four of the last 10 Ashes series, including winning the most recent series 4–0 in 2017–18, but the 2015 series, the most recent to be held in England, was won 3–2 by the home side.\nNo visiting team had won an Ashes series and/or retained the Ashes since England defeated Australia 3–1 away in 2010–11. Furthermore, Australia last won an Ashes series in England in 2001. The two teams previously met in one warm-up game and two ODI matches in the Cricket World Cup held in England and Wales in the previous months, with Australia winning the warm-up game at the Rose Bowl by 12 runs and the group stage match convincingly by 64 runs at Lord's. In their semi final rematch, England had their own convincing win by eight wickets with 107 balls to spare, en route to winning the tournament for the first time.\nAustralia's last two Test series before the Ashes were played against India and Sri Lanka during the home summer season of 2018–19. Although India won their tour series 2–1, the first time India had won a Test series in Australia, Australia recovered to win the Test series against Sri Lanka 2–0.\nPrior to the Ashes series, Australia had its top-order batsmen David Warner, Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft available for international selection, who were banned from playing international cricket for 9–12 months due to the 2018 Australian ball-tampering scandal in Cape Town against South Africa. All three cricketers were named in Australia's squad for the 2019 Ashes.\nMeanwhile, England warmed up for the 2019 Ashes with a Test series earlier in the year against the West Indies and a one-off Test against Ireland in July. The tour of the West Indies comprised three matches and was won 2–1 by the West Indies. England then improved to win the one-off Test against Ireland, by 143 runs.\nAhead of the series, it was announced that the second day of the Lord's Test would benefit the Ruth Strauss Foundation, a cancer charity set up in memory of the wife of England's Ashes-winning captain Andrew Strauss, who had died on 29 December 2018 from a rare form of lung cancer. Both teams wore red caps, the stumps were red, and fans were also encouraged to wear red. Australia already had a similar tradition – the Jane McGrath Day is the third day of the Sydney Test during the traditional New Year's Test time slot, in honour of the English-born wife of Australian fast bowler Glenn McGrath, who died from breast cancer, only with pink replacing red, and the proceeds benefiting the McGrath Foundation.\nSquads.\nOn 26 July 2019, Australia announced a 17-man touring party for the Ashes series. England announced their squad for the first Test on 27 July.\n1 Jack Leach was added to England's squad for the second Test, with Moeen Ali being dropped.\n2 Ahead of the fourth Test, James Anderson was ruled out of England's squad for the rest of the series, with Craig Overton named as replacement.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nDay one.\nThe first morning of the Ashes saw Stuart Broad take the wickets of both openers, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft, who (along with Steve Smith) were returning to the Test format for the first time since their suspension for a ball-tampering incident in 2018. Warner was the first gone, leg before wicket in the fourth over, while Bancroft was caught behind just four overs later. Despite the early breakthrough, all was not tidy for England as James Anderson, recovering from an injury, bowled only four overs in the session, and while he came back onto the field, it was reported at the lunch interval that he was suffering from tightness in his right calf, and he left the field for a scan in the afternoon. Usman Khawaja was given out after drinks thanks to a review, caught by Bairstow off a thin edge. Despite this setback, Steve Smith and Travis Head managed to hold on until lunch, leaving Australia 83/3 at the break.\nThe first hour after lunch saw the fall of four wickets, due to good efforts by Broad and Woakes, with Head the first to go, leg before wicket to Woakes after a not out decision was referred to the third umpire, the fourth-wicket partnership having stood for 64 runs. Matthew Wade was the next man in, but he was soon dismissed in similar fashion. Tim Paine was caught at deep square leg after a \"horror shot\", and James Pattinson fell two balls later for a duck, leaving Australia 112/7 at the end of the 40th over. Pat Cummins fell shortly thereafter with the total at 122, but Australia scampered through to tea at 154/8, Smith unbeaten on 66.\nThe final session's start was delayed by 20 minutes because of the weather. Peter Siddle and Smith then shared an 88-run partnership, before Siddle was dismissed six runs short of a half-century. Smith then managed to keep the strike for the better part of a dozen overs, reaching a century in the process as the fielders were spread out on the boundary, but he was dismissed with the first over of the new ball, having reached 144 runs on his return to Test cricket, lifting Australia to a respectable 284 all out after being 122/8, with Nathan Lyon unbeaten on 12.\nThis left England's openers two overs to navigate before the close of play, which they batted out to a score of 10 without loss.\nDay two.\nThe morning of the second day saw the wicket of Jason Roy fall, caught behind in the slips off a delivery from Pattinson. Joe Root and Rory Burns managed to play out the rest of the session without loss, despite a scare after drinks, as Root was beaten by a ball that hit his off stump but failed to dislodge the bails; he was initially given out after the ball was caught behind, but a review showed the only contact was with the stump. This left England on 71/1 at the break, wearing down Australia's bowlers but getting little return for their troubles in terms of runs.\nAfter lunch, both English batsmen piled on the runs on a pitch that was becoming more batsman-friendly. Root was then given out leg before wicket to Siddle, but the review this time showed he made contact, and the on-field decision was overturned. Burns soon reached a half-century, Root following suit shortly afterwards. He was finally out caught and bowled to Siddle before tea, having stood for a 132-run third-wicket partnership. The new man in, Joe Denly, stuck around until the end of the session, England reaching 170/2 with Burns 18 runs away from a maiden Test century.\nThe evening session saw the umpires decide to replace the ball after the 60th over. The replacement ball saw off Denly and Buttler, England now 194/4. A few overs later, Burns reached his century, becoming the first English opener to score a hundred in the first Test of an Ashes series since Graham Gooch in 1993. Burns and Ben Stokes survived the remainder of the extended final session, building a 73-run partnership, as Travis Head and Matthew Wade were brought in to bowl a few overs before the new ball, which claimed no victims by the close of play; England were 267/4, trailing Australia by 17 runs.\nDay three.\nAs play resumed on the third morning, England caught up to Australia's total, Stokes reaching a half-century before edging to the wicket-keeper on the next ball he faced from Cummins, the fifth wicket having stood for 88 runs. Shortly after drinks, Nathan Lyon was the next man to strike for Australia, taking Burns' wicket and dismissing Moeen Ali for a duck in the same over. Bairstow was out to Siddle in the next over, Australia having taken three wickets in the space of 11 balls. Woakes and Broad survived the half-hour left until lunch to put England on 328/8, the game in the balance as Australia had limited their first-innings deficit to only 44 runs at that point.\nDuring the break, there was good news for England, as it was confirmed that Anderson, injured on the first day, would be able to bat, and had bowled in the nets during the interval. Broad and Woakes built a 65-run partnership, surviving until drinks, after which Broad was caught on a short delivery from Cummins. Anderson came in to bat, but made just three runs, England all out for 374 (a lead of 90), leading to an early tea interval. Concerns over Anderson's fitness were again apparent as he \"wasn't moving well between the wickets\", and when the teams returned to the field for the final session, he was absent.\nWith 44 overs scheduled, the evening session began with the early wicket of Warner, after a review saw him caught behind off Broad in the third over; his aggregate total of 10 runs for the match was his third-lowest in Tests when batting twice. Ali was the next to strike, removing Bancroft and almost getting Khawaja in the same over, only for the latter to be dropped by Jos Buttler at second slip. Khawaja was finally out off Ben Stokes' second ball, having stood for a 48-run third-wicket partnership with Smith, who again looked in top form despite being struck by a bouncer later on, which prompted the intervention of team doctors in light of new concussion protocols. Bad light stopped play just after 6 p.m., 31 overs having been bowled, with Australia 124/3 at the close, leading by 34 runs with Smith unbeaten on 46 and Travis Head also contributing 21 runs to the total.\nDay four.\nThe following morning saw a good session for Australia as Smith and Head put up a century partnership before drinks, Smith already with a half-century. England's potential chase became more and more uncomfortable throughout the session, despite a few scares for the batsmen. Head fell just before lunch, having put up a half-century of his own in the 130-run fourth-wicket stand. England's bowling attack, lacking Anderson, who was out of it for the remainder of the match, did not pick up another wicket by the interval and Australia were in a strong position at 231/4, having extended their lead to 141 runs, and Smith two runs short of a second century in the match.\nThe afternoon session began with Smith reaching his century, becoming only the fifth Australian to get two in an Ashes Test. With the 80th over approaching, Wade managed his own half-century as England was \"out of options\", with Root, Denly and Ali having spells that resulted in a few close calls, and a leg before wicket appeal against Smith that was deemed not out after an England review. In the first over of the new ball, Wade was given out, but his successful review saw the decision overturned. Australia finally lost a wicket in the next over as Smith was caught for 142, becoming only the fourth batsmen to score more than 140 in both innings of a Test. The fifth wicket having stood for 126 runs, skipper Tim Paine was the man in for the few overs left until tea, by which point Australia were 356/5, giving them a comfortable lead of 266.\nThe evening session saw Wade get a century of his own, the Australian lead now extended to over 300 runs. Paine was found not out after an England review for leg before wicket, but the sixth-wicket partnership, having stood for 76 runs, was broken in the next over as Wade was caught at deep backward square. Paine was bowled by Ali an over later, offering hints of a collapse, but Pattinson and Cummins, both unbeaten, then added 78 runs before the Australian side declared on 487/7, leaving England a target of 398.\nWith seven overs left in the day, England's openers were brought out to bat, safely going through them for 13 runs. Although their chances of winning were slim, a draw was still feasible.\nDay five.\nThe final morning saw Burns become only the fourth England batsmen to bat on all five days of a Test, but this accolade meant little when he was dismissed early, caught by Lyon at gully off Cummins' bowling. Joe Root was then given out leg before wicket twice, but the decision was overturned on review both times, marking yet further poor umpiring decisions in the match. Root then stood with Roy until drinks, but the partnership was ended at 41 runs after the latter was bowled playing a rash shot at a delivery from Lyon. Denly was in and out before lunch, the review not saving him this time, as Lyon struck again and had him caught at short leg. Buttler came in and survived an lbw review by Australia, but Root was dismissed by Lyon 10 minutes before lunch, England 85/4 at the break, after a session that was deemed to be \"Australia's morning\", thanks mostly to Lyon's contribution.\nThe afternoon was again fruitful for Australia, as Buttler was bowled by Cummins in the first over after the interval. Bairstow was next to fall, gloving the ball behind to become Cummins' 100th Test wicket after an unsuccessful review. Lyon struck with the next ball, removing Stokes for his 350th Test wicket, becoming the fourth Australian to reach that landmark, joining Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Dennis Lillee as England were in the midst of a collapse. Chris Woakes managed to slow Australia's progress until after drinks, striking boundaries and surviving a review for lbw, but Ali was then dismissed for Lyon's fifth wicket of the innings, falling to the Australian spinner for the ninth time in 11 innings. Broad was then out for a golden duck, England now 136/9, giving Lyon the chance to win the match with a hat-trick ball against Anderson; the English batsman survived the delivery, and Woakes was dropped by Smith at second slip a few overs later on a ball that rolled on to the boundary, as dark clouds loomed over the ground; however, Smith made amends two overs later, catching Woakes off the bowling of Cummins to end the match before tea, Australia coming back from 122/8 in their first innings to win by 251 runs and take a 1–0 Ashes lead. It was their first Test win at Edgbaston since 2001.\nSteve Smith was named man of the match after scoring a century in each innings.\nAftermath.\nAfter the match, it was confirmed that, because of his calf injury, James Anderson would be ruled out of the second Test, and would also be likely to miss the third Test. Any further participation in the series was also uncertain, with Jofra Archer expected to replace him. England captain Joe Root nevertheless refused to blame anybody, saying that Anderson had passed all fitness tests before the match and that his selection had been unanimous. England's pace bowling options remained limited for further Tests, however, as potential replacement Olly Stone was also injured in training. Despite troubling performances by other members of the side, including Buttler, Bairstow and Ali, Root did not wish to make any \"shotgun decisions\" and noted that, despite the team's inconsistency, England were far from being out of contention. England's prioritisation of white-ball cricket was also put in a bad light after disappointing performances by players more accustomed to One Day Internationals than Tests.\nAustralian skipper Tim Paine noted that Anderson's exclusion had deprived England of one of the world's best bowlers, and that his side's confidence grew as a result. However, he also warned against becoming complacent, making parallels with Australia's performance in preceding tours against India, South Africa and Pakistan, where they \"[jumped] the gun with an emphatic win only to surrender a high-profile series\". In the meantime, Australia played a three-day tour match against Worcestershire, which, as a result of rain washing out most of the final day, was drawn.\nCriticism was directed at umpires Aleem Dar and Joel Wilson, who had 10 of their decisions overturned over the course of the game, with former Australia captain Ricky Ponting suggesting that the ICC's requirements of neutral umpires should be waived in the future, to reduce umpire workload and fatigue. Root, however, noted that players and umpires, both under pressure to perform, make mistakes, and that over-criticism and blame games should be avoided. The idea, which had already surfaced before, had also been opposed by the umpires themselves, who \"[were] happier to accept criticism of their decision-making on a basis of skills, conditions, eyesight – just about anything so long as they are not regarded as biased towards one side\".\nSecond Test.\nDay one.\nThe first day of the second Test was washed out because of intermittent rain that prevented the ground from drying and the toss from taking place, leaving four extended days, weather permitting, to complete the match.\nDay two.\nPlay began on the second day with England's openers sent in to bat in the morning session. Australia struck in the second over, Jason Roy out for a three-ball duck, caught by Paine off Hazlewood's bowling, the latter returning to the Test side after not being selected for Edgbaston. Joe Root then came in, but he was trapped leg before wicket by Hazlewood, leaving England at 26/2. Denly, the new man in, was hit by a bouncer in the next over, leading to an early drinks break. Nevertheless, he and Rory Burns survived until lunch, contributing a 50-run partnership to rebuild England's innings after the early wickets. This left the home team at 76/2 at the interval.\nThe second session saw Denly caught behind by Tim Paine off Hazlewood, before Burns reached a half-century. His wicket fell shortly thereafter, however, thanks to a splendid catch by Bancroft at short leg, off the bowling of Cummins. Jos Buttler and Ben Stokes were the next to fall, leaving England on 138/6 with less than an hour to go until tea. Australia reviewed for lbw against Bairstow a few overs before the interval, but this turned out to be a poor decision and the England batsmen did not lose any more wickets before the break, by which point they were 201/6.\nThe extended evening session, with 37 overs scheduled over two-and-a-half hours, first saw Woakes caught behind on a ball that grazed his glove, the review confirming the on-field decision. England's remaining wickets then fell quickly, with Archer and Broad the next victims. Bairstow reached the 50-run milestone, but he was soon gone, England all out for 258.\nThis left England's bowlers a theoretical 18 overs in just under an hour before the close. Warner fell first in the fifth over, for his third single-digit score of the series; however, Bancroft and Khawaja survived eight more overs before play was brought to a close with Australia on 30/1.\nDay three.\nThe third morning saw 24.1 overs of play, the second wicket pushing the score to 60 before Bancroft was leg before wicket to Archer. Khawaja edged behind off Woakes in the next over, and Head did not last long as he was lbw to Broad, Australia 71/4. Stokes then thought he had Wade trapped for another lbw, but the on-field decision was overturned and Australia lost no further wickets before rain brought an early lunch, the total now 80/4. The weather remained inclement throughout the afternoon and the evening, and no further play was possible.\nDay four.\nPlay resumed on the fourth day with Smith and Wade at the crease. Wade was caught at slip off a delivery by Broad shortly before drinks, but Paine survived with Smith until lunch, the latter reaching a half-century to bring Australia's total to 155/5 at the break, England failing to make any further breakthroughs despite a few close calls.\nThe sixth-wicket partnership was broken after the interval as Paine edged the ball to Buttler off Archer. Smith was then hit on the arm by a short delivery from Archer a few overs later, but was given the green light to continue after examination by team doctors. A review for lbw against Cummins was soon struck down as Archer continued to put pressure on the Australian batsmen, including hitting Smith directly in the neck with a bouncer; the batsman fell to the ground briefly, but had to retire hurt, though he was able to walk off the field unassisted after a chat with the team doctor. The new man in, Siddle, lasted only a few overs, failing to reach a double-digit score, at which point Smith was brought back in; however, he was soon out leg before wicket to Woakes after an unsuccessful review. Australia's tailenders were out before tea, giving them a total of 250, trailing by eight runs with England's second innings to begin after the interval.\nCummins struck early by removing Roy and then getting Root for a golden duck, but Denly survived the hat-trick ball. This led to a 55-run fourth-wicket partnership, which ended with Denly caught and bowled by Siddle. Burns fell next, but Buttler survived until late in the session, when rain stopped play for the day with England on 96/4.\nDay five.\nThe final day was again affected by rain as the start was delayed until just after noon. As the players came back on the field, there was confirmation that Steve Smith, struck by a bouncer the previous day, would not come back to the match. He was substituted by Marnus Labuschagne, who became the first concussion substitute in Test cricket after the ICC's decision to allow such replacements. Smith was later ruled out of the third Test at Headingley.\nEngland's fifth wicket stood for the remainder of the morning session as Ben Stokes reached a half-century, unbeaten on 51 at the interval with England at 157/4. Buttler was caught by Hazlewood off Cummins soon after lunch, but Bairstow played on with Stokes until the latter reached a century, at which point England declared on 258/5. This left Australia a target of 267 runs to win off a scheduled 50 overs, albeit leaving England with an outside chance to bowl their opposition out. England made an early breakthrough, Archer removing both Warner and Khawaja inside the first six overs, before Leach trapped Bancroft lbw with the final ball of the 14th over; however, Labuschagne and Head proved obstinate at the crease, putting on 85 runs for the fourth wicket before Labuschagne was caught by a diving Root at midwicket for 59 at the end of the 36th over. Labuschagne also went onto become the first concussion substitute to score a test fifty during the process. Wade was next to go seven balls later, out for one, before Denly produced a diving catch to remove Paine for four off the bowling of Archer, Australia now 149/6. Nevertheless, Head continued to stick around at the other end, farming the strike from Cummins and managing 42 runs to help Australia see out the final eight overs.\nBen Stokes was named man of the match after scoring a century in the second innings.\nThird Test.\nDay one.\nRain delayed the toss in the morning and play started shortly after noon with lunch delayed to 1:30 p.m. Only four overs could be completed before rain again interrupted play after the wicket of Harris, Australia 12/1. Lunch was taken early, but rain did not allow for resumption of play until 2 p.m. Khawaja was then caught after England referred the decision to the video umpire, but only 9.5 overs were possible before rain again prevented continuation. A few more overs were possible before bad light stopped play, with Australia on 54/2 at the early tea interval.\nThe evening session was unaffected by rain, and Australia's third wicket stood for 111 runs before Warner, having previously successfully overturned an on-field decision, was caught off Archer. After this, Australia, on 136/3, collapsed to 179 all out by the close. Archer claimed five more victims to end the innings with figures of 6/45 in his second Test match.\nDay two.\nThe second day was played in sunny conditions, but this did not prevent England from struggling with the bat; Denly was the only batsman to reach double digits, scoring 12 after surviving an lbw review. England were 54/6 at the interval, with the Ashes \"hanging by a thread\".\nThe England debacle continued after lunch, with Woakes out on the first ball of the afternoon session, the final three wickets then falling in quick succession as the home side was all out for 67, with Hazlewood picking up a five-wicket haul for the visitors.\nThe dismal batting performance of both teams, the previous 18 wickets having fallen for 110 runs, appeared to continue into the second Australia innings as Warner was lbw for a duck in the second over. Harris and Khawaja added 26 runs to the total, surviving a review for lbw, before Harris was bowled by Leach. Khawaja was soon caught by Roy at second slip off Woakes, and Australia were 82/3 at tea.\nAfter the interval, the fourth wicket stood for 46 runs before losing Head with the total at 97/4, only for Wade and Labuschagne to build a 66-run partnership after surviving multiple reviews. Wade and Paine were given out shortly before stumps, as Labuschagne reached a half-century to put Australia on 171/6, a lead of 283.\nDay three.\nThe third day was played in similar sunny conditions to the second. Labuschagne and Pattinson returned to the crease, with the former resuming on 53 not out. Their partnership eventually reached 51 before Pattinson was caught behind by Root off Archer's bowling. Cummins came in to join Labuschagne but his innings was short-lived, as he made just six runs before being caught in the slips by Burns off Stokes. Shortly after, Labuschagne was run out by Denly and finished on 80 runs, with Australia at 237/9 and leading by 349 runs. The final wicket fell half an hour before lunch as Lyon was bowled out by Archer and Australia finished with a lead of 358, setting what would be England's highest ever run chase in Test cricket.\nEngland's second innings began shortly before lunch and openers Burns and Roy saw out the opening overs to go in 11/0 at the break. Shortly after play resumed, England lost both their opening batsmen in quick succession. Burns fell first, caught behind off Hazlewood before Roy was bowled by Cummins. Root and Denly came to the crease at 15/2 with just under two sessions until the close of play. The pair built a solid partnership and moved to 140/2 with both reaching half-centuries before Denly was given out caught behind off Hazlewood. Stokes was the next batsman in and was able to see out the rest of the day with Root. England finished on 156/3, requiring 203 more runs for victory.\nDay four.\nThe fourth day of the Test started poorly for England. The first 25 balls were dots and the new ball was due to be available to Australia in another four overs. Root eventually opened the scoring for the day before being caught behind by Warner off Lyon's bowling, having made 77 runs. This wicket took Lyon to 356 in Test cricket and saw him go third in Australia's list of all-time highest Test wicket-takers. Bairstow joined Stokes at the crease with the score 159/4 and the partnership made 79 runs before lunch to bring England to 238/4, needing 121 more runs to win. At this stage, it seemed as though if Stokes and Bairstow could continue batting as sensibly as they had, then victory was a real possibility.\nHowever, soon after play resumed, England suffered a string of quick wickets. Bairstow was the first to fall, caught behind by Labuschagne off Hazlewood for 36. Buttler was in next but made only 1 before confusion between him and Stokes left him well short of his crease when Head hit the stumps to run him out. Similarly, Woakes came in next and added just one run before driving a ball from Hazlewood straight to Wade. At this point, England were 261/7 and needed 98 more runs to win. Archer came to the crease and added 15 to the score with a few boundaries before picking out Head at deep midwicket off Lyon. Broad survived just one ball before being given out lbw, which was confirmed after his review, and England had just one wicket remaining with 73 more runs needed for victory. Since the lunch interval, they had lost 5 wickets for just 48 runs.\nJack Leach was the final man in for England with the score at 286/9 and their game plan soon became apparent. Stokes took the brunt of the Australian attack, never allowing Leach to face more than the final couple of balls of any over so that Stokes could keep the strike. Stokes started well, hitting Lyon for a six in the first over of the partnership. He then made a few runs from the next over from Pattinson before hitting Lyon for two sixes in the next over, the second a reverse sweep, finishing the over with England at 310/9. Two overs later, he hit Cummins for another six before pulling Hazlewood for four to reach his century. He then hit two more sixes from Hazlewood's bowling – making 16 from just three balls – and moved England to 338/9. Stokes was then dropped by Harris, although it was a tough catch to take, before hitting consecutive fours off Cummins to move the score to 350/9. Leach then had to face the final two balls of Cummins' over and an lbw shout off the final ball was reviewed by Australia after umpire Chris Gaffaney gave it not out; the ball was found to have pitched outside leg, confirming umpire Gaffaney's decision, and the review was lost. Lyon continued the attack and was smacked down the ground for six more by Stokes. England needed just two runs to win and one run to tie. Two balls later, Lyon fumbled what would have been a certain run-out with Leach well out of his crease before hitting Stokes on the pad to huge cries for lbw. Umpire Joel Wilson gave it not out and Australia had no reviews left; had the decision been reviewed, it would have been given out. This was the final ball of the over so Stokes was unable to rotate the strike and Leach potentially had to face a full over from Cummins. He scored a single from the third ball of the over to ensure England could not lose the game and gave Stokes the strike with England needing just one run to win. Stokes promptly cut the next ball from Cummins through the covers for four to give England the most unlikely victory imaginable, completing their highest ever run chase in Tests.\nIn popular culture.\nAn Australian docu-series - The Test was produced, following the Australian national cricket team in the aftermath of the Australian ball tampering scandal. The seventh and eighth episode of Season 1 featured Australia playing the five tests against England."

        "text": "The 2024 EHF European Men's Handball Championship was the 16th edition of the tournament and the third to feature 24 national teams. It was hosted in Germany from 10 to 28 January 2024.\nThe two opening games were played in front of an audience of 53,586 spectators, which set a world record. The tournament also set a record for total number of spectators for handball and was the first to surpass a million.\nFrance won their fourth title after a win over Denmark, while Sweden captured the bronze medal over Germany.\nBid process.\nBids.\nOn 4 May 2017, it was announced that the following countries had sent in an official expression of interest:\nHowever, when the deadline for submitting the final bids expired, the following applications had been received:\nHost selection.\nOn 20 June 2018 at the 14th ordinary EHF Congress held in Glasgow, Germany was selected to host the competition.\nVenues.\nOn 10 June 2021, the host cities were announced where the championship will be played in six cities. The opening game will be held in Merkur Spiel-Arena in Düsseldorf and is aiming to break the world record for the largest attendance at an indoor handball game and the final will be held in Lanxess Arena in Cologne. On 14 September 2022, it was announced that the classic venue Olympiahalle in Munich (previously hosted Handball at the 1972 Summer Olympics main round and medal games and also the group stage games in the 2019 World Men's Handball Championship) would replace the delay-ridden SAP Garden. Due to material and labour shortages, the venue would not be completed in time for the tournament in January 2024, therefore being dropped by the organisers. Both Olympiahalle and the future SAP Garden are located close to each other in the Olympiapark.\nQualification.\nThe qualification for the final tournament has taken place between November 2021 and April 2023. Germany as the host team, and the three best placed not already qualified teams from the previous championship, were automatically qualified, leaving a total of 36 national teams to compete for the remaining 20 places in the final tournament.\nThe competition consists of two rounds: a relegation round and qualifiers. In the relegation round, the three best placed teams from the 2021 Men's IHF/EHF Trophy joined by Luxembourg as best ranked team according EHF which haven't participated in the second round of the previous qualifiers, faced the four worst ranked fourth-placed teams from the second round of the 2022 qualification. The four winners of the two-legged relegation round matches advance to the qualifiers, joining the remaining twenty teams that participated in the 2022 championship and the remaining eight teams that were eliminated in the second round of the 2022 qualification. Those 32 teams will be divided into eight groups by four teams, with top two teams and four best ranked third-teams qualifying.\nMarketing.\nThe official logo and slogan was unveiled on 6 January 2022. The basis for the logo design is the place where everything is decided in handball and where emotions arise: the lines of the court. Those were transformed into the compact shape of a ball that conveys the dynamics of the sport. The logo was designed by and in collaboration with Berlin-based agency Styleheads. The heart of the communication is the claim \"HERE TO PLAY!\" This is activated in several variants in order to convey the different facets of the Men's EHF EURO 2024 and the individual locations. The following variations of the claim were used:\nDraw.\nThe draw took place on 10 May 2023 in Düsseldorf, Germany.\nSeeding.\nThe seedings were announced on 1 May 2023.\nReferees.\nThe 18 referee pairs were selected on 25 September 2023.\nSquads.\nEach team consists of up to 20 players, of whom 16 may be fielded for each match.\nTiebreakers.\nIn the preliminary and main rounds, if two or more teams are equal on points, their ranking is determined as follows:\nIf the ranking of one of the teams in question is determined, the criteria are consecutively reapplied to the remaining teams until all the rankings are determined. If this procedure does not lead to a decision, the Fair Play Ranking decides about the final group ranking. The Fair Play Ranking is decided by the EHF in accordance with the parameters rated as follows:\nIn case the number of points in the Fair Play Ranking are identical, a draw is carried out by the EHF in the presence of at least one official from each of the concerned teams.\nPreliminary round.\nThe schedule was released on 1 March 2023.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nMain round.\nPoints and goals gained in the preliminary group against teams that advance were transferred to the main round.\nRanking and statistics.\nFinal ranking.\nThe teams ranked fourth in each group after the completion of the preliminary round matches will be ranked 19 to 24, while teams ranked third in each group after the completion of the preliminary round matches will be ranked 13 to 18 according to the number of points won in the preliminary round. Places seven or eight will be attributed to the two teams ranked fourth in the main round groups, places nine and ten to the two teams ranked fifth in the main round groups, places eleven and twelve to the two teams ranked sixth in the main round groups according to the number of points won by the respective teams after completion of the main round matches. Places one to six will be decided by play–off or knock–out.\nAll Star Team.\nThe all-star team was announced on 28 January 2024."

        "text": "The 1972–73 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in college ice hockey. In its seventh year under head coach Bob Johnson, the team compiled a 29–9–2 record (18–9–1 against Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) opponents) and outscored all opponents 217 to 139. The Badgers received one of the WCHA's automatic bids to the 1973 NCAA University Division Men's Ice Hockey Tournament by winning the 1973 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. They defeated the Cornell Big Red in the Frozen Four semifinals and then beat WCHA-rival Denver Pioneers 4–2 to win their first national championship in Boston, Massachusetts.\nForward Dean Talafous was chosen as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament. He had the winning goal in both of Wisconsin's victories as well as a tying score in the waning moments of the Badgers' semifinal match.\nSeason.\nComing off of a then-season-best 27 wins, and second NCAA tournament appearance in three years, Wisconsin was looking to take the final step towards winning a national championship. After losing to a dismal Colorado College team in their first game, Bob Johnson's Badgers went on an eleven-game tear and announced themselves as early-season contenders. In hindsight their 11-1 record was a bit misleading due to having faced CC and Michigan (the two worst WCHA teams) four times each as well as a series against 15th-place Colgate, going 9-1 in those games. Once Wisconsin began to face difficult opponents their record came back to earth. While their overall mark dipped as the season wore on, Wisconsin's home record remained in the stratosphere, not dropping a single match at the Dane County Coliseum until March and finishing with an astounding 17-1 record at home.\nKey to the Badgers' success was a very evenly distributed offense. While none of Wisconsin's players finished anywhere near the top of the NCAA leaderboard, the team produced five 20-goal scorers and a further five 10-goal scorers, a feat some NHL teams struggle to achieve in twice as many games. The balanced Badger attack kept Wisconsin alive as they slowly dipped in the standings especially with their trouble on the road. After Minnesota ended Wisconsin's winning streak the Badgers won the St. Louis Invitational Tournament over the Christmas break but split the next two true away series. Starting with a loss to Michigan State on January 13 the Badgers dropped the final five road games and were in jeopardy of slipping to 4th in the conference when the Golden Gophers beat them at home in the penultimate game of the regular season. A win in the last match, however, kept them tied with Michigan State in the standings and with the tie-breakers in Wisconsin's favor the Badgers were able to avoid a potential matchup with league-leading Denver in the WCHA tournament.\nWisconsin began the conference tournament facing Minnesota and got a measure of revenge for earlier struggles with a pair of two-goal victories. The second round saw the Badgers pitted against Notre Dame and, because of a weekend sweep by the Fighting Irish at the end of February, Wisconsin was forced to face their foe in the opponent's building. Despite the game technically being a neutral-site meeting the hostile crowd let everyone know was favored. The two teams battled to a 4-4 tie in the first game, leaving the second match as a winner-take-all affair. Miraculously Wisconsin proved the victor with a 4-3 score and won their way into the NCAA tournament for the third time.\nFor their first match Wisconsin was set against the powerhouse ECAC Hockey champion Cornell Big Red. The boys from Ithaca possessed one of the strongest defenses in the nation, surrendering only 83 goals in 27 games en route to posting a 23-3-1 record. The favored Big Red didn't disappoint, scoring the opening goal 40 seconds into the game. After a second marker in the first frame and another 30 seconds into the middle period the Badgers were behind the eight-ball. Cornell score yet again four minutes later and before the game was even half over the Badger's already appeared to have been defeated. The decentralized Badger attack finally made itself known in the second half of period two with a pair of markers to cut Cornell's lead in half. With the Wisconsin faithful chanting 'SIEVE' at Dave Elenbaas Cornell didn't seem to mind and scored their third goal in the first minute of a period to take a 5-2 lead. Somehow, despite being outplayed, Wisconsin pulled to within one with goals at 12- and 3-minutes to play. With time winding down the Badgers furiously fired the puck and with five seconds left on the clock Dean Talafous notched the tying goal and sent the building into a frenzy. The overtime session saw several opportunities by both squads but as fatigue began to set in mistakes were made and just before the first extra frame ended a trio of Badgers rushed towards the goal. Elenbaas tried to meet them head-on but the puck found its way onto the stick of Talafous who shot it into the net and allowed Wisconsin to capture an improbable 6-5 overtime win.\nIn Wisconsin's first championship game they faced the other top team in the NCAA, Denver. The Pioneers possessed an even stingier defense, led by WCHA Most Valuable Player and All-American Ron Grahame. While Denver had a good offense and four First Team All-WCHA players, the Badgers' unheralded bunch had combined to score more than Denver had and managed to earn two Second Team positions. The Badgers got out to an early lead just over three minutes into the game but the Pioneers responded with one of their own less than a minute later. While the play favored Wisconsin the score didn't and Denver was able to take a lead with a power play marker 54 seconds into the second period. just over three minutes later Bob Young took Denver's only penalty of the game and it proved a costly one as Wisconsin was able to tie the score on the ensuing man-advantage. Just over four minutes after that Dean Talafous scored his third goal of the tournament to put the Badgers into the lead for the second time. The score remained that way until the third minute of the final period when Jim Johnston gave Wisconsin a two-goal lead. Denver was unable to match the Badger's fervor and Jim Makey's stellar goaltending allowed Wisconsin to skate off with their first National Title.\nWisconsin's win brought the crown back to the WCHA for the first time in four seasons and started a five-year run of western dominance where no eastern team could even make the title match. Dean Talafous scored both game-winning goals for the Badgers as well as notching the tying marker in the semifinal so it came with no surprise that he was named as the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Along with Talafous, Jim Makey, John Taft and Stan Hinkley were named to the All-Tournament Team After the tournament had ended the NCAA wanted to enforce a new policy that would make students who had played for Canadian junior team ineligible as they received a nominal stipend for room and board which the NCAA considered a payment making those players professionals. To ease the transition the NCAA told the universities that they wanted their programs to declare their own players ineligible and afterwards the NCAA would restore status to the players, effectively 'grandfathering' in the prohibition on major junior players. While most teams, including Wisconsin, acquiesced to the NCAA, Denver refused to follow suit and had their players not only ruled ineligible but their participation in the 1973 tournament vacated.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season, Wisconsin compiled a 29–10–2 record, the best year the program had produced to that point. Its schedule was as follows.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nNational championship.\n(W1) Denver vs. (W2) Wisconsin.\nJim Makey, John Taft, Stan Hinkley and Dean Talafous were named to the All-Tournament Team"

The race took place on Friday, May 11, 1928, eight days before the Kentucky Derby making it the first leg of the U.S. Triple Crown series. A horse race for three-year-old thoroughbreds, it carried a total purse of $71,370. It was run on a track rated fast in a final time of 2:00 1/5. Ridden by future U.S. Racing Hall of Fame inductee Raymond Workman, Victorian won the race by a nose over runner-up Toro. Nassak, the betting favorite from the powerful Rancocas Stable finished a distant 11th. The fifth-place finisher, Sun Beau, went on to a brilliant racing career and was voted U.S. Champion Older Horse in three straight years culminating with his 1996 induction into the U.S. National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.\nNo Triple Crown attempt.\nThe owners of the Preakness winner chose not to send the colt to Louisville, Kentucky to compete in the May 19th Kentucky Derby. The \"Daily Racing Form\" reported that Victorian's owner made a statement by telephone saying the colt had gone through a very tough Preakness and did not do well after the race. Plans called for transporting Victorian to Belmont Park where he would run in the Withers Stakes if his trainer thought the colt was healthy. Victorian won the Withers Stakes.\nRecord crowd.\nThe \"Daily Racing Form\" reported there was a record crowd in attendance on Preakness day which included notables such as Belgium's Prince Ernest and Princess Marguerite de Ligne, Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., father of a future President of the United States, the British Ambassador Sir Esmé Howard, Bernard Baruch, George Saportas, and James Wood Colt, among others.\nMaryland Governor Albert Ritchie presented the Woodlawn Vase to James G. Rowe Jr., the winning trainer who accepted it on behalf of the absent Harry Payne Whitney.\nDeath of scheduled Preakness rider.\nTwenty-five-year-old jockey Ovila Bourassa was scheduled to ride Solace in the 1928 Preakness. The colt, who would finish third, was owned by the Seagram Stables for whom jockey Bourassa had ridden Sir Harry to a second-place finish in the 1927 Preakness Stakes. Three weeks prior to the running of the 1928 Preakness, the young jockey died from a fractured skull after the saddle girth slipped on a horse he was breezing in the early morning hours at Havre de Grace Racetrack in Havre de Grace, Maryland.\nA champion Canadian jockey, and very popular with his racing fraternity and race fans in the United States, Ovila Bourassa's death received wide coverage in newspapers in both countries. The \"New York Times\" wrote that Bourassa \"rode winners of many classics\" and was \"one of the best-known riders in the country\". The \"New York Daily News\" called him a \"rider of great promise\" and someone who was \"in the first rank of riders.\" In his native Canada, the \"Calgary Daily Herald\" said Ovila Bourassa was \"one of the outstanding figures in Canadian racing.\"\nPayout.\nThe 51st Preakness Stakes Payout Schedule\nThe full chart.\n\"Daily Racing Form\" Charts"

        "text": "A total of 10 teams in each tournament (5 athletes per team) will qualify for a quota of 100 athletes in curling at the 2022 Winter Olympics. A further 10 mixed doubles pairs will qualify for a total of 20 athletes. Therefore, a total of 120 athletes can qualify in total to compete in the curling competitions.\nSummary.\nFinal summary.\nSix nations - Canada, Great Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United States, along with hosts China - achieved a maximum representation of 12 quota places across all three events, while, in total 14 NOCS are represented in the curling competition in Beijing. Although they competed in the 1992 demonstration event, this will be Australia's debut in curling as a full Olympic event.\nQualification System.\nThe 2022 Winter Olympics is scheduled to feature ten-team fields for each of the three tournaments (men's, women's, and mixed doubles). This will be an increase from the eight-team mixed doubles field in 2018.\nPrior to the COVID-19 pandemic, nations were to earn Olympic Qualification Points based on their performance at the 2020 and 2021 World Curling Championships. China (as the host nation) will receive an automatic berth in each discipline. The top seven other nations in the Olympic Qualification Point list for each discipline were also to receive positions in the Olympics. The remaining two positions in each tournament were to be awarded to the winners of an Olympic Qualification Event in late 2021.\nThis system was amended after 2020 World Curling Championships were cancelled due to the pandemic. Now only the 2021 world championship results are used for automatic qualification. The top six nations in the 2021 men's and women's world championships qualified for the Olympics, and the top seven nations in the 2021 World Mixed Doubles Curling Championship also qualified. China qualified for all three Olympic tournaments as the host nation. The remaining positions in the Olympic tournament will be awarded to the top nations in Olympic Qualification Events to be held in late 2021. All nations that qualified for world championships in 2020 or 2021 but have not already qualified for the Olympics will be eligible to compete in the Olympic Qualification Events, in addition to the top two (men's and women's) or three (mixed doubles) qualifiers in a Pre-Qualifier Event that is open to all other nations.\nQualification Results.\nMixed doubles.\nNote: Scotland, England and Wales all compete separately in international curling. By an agreement between the curling federations of those three home nations, only Scotland can qualify for the Olympics on behalf of Great Britain.\nNational qualifying events.\nSome countries select their teams through trial qualification tournaments."

        "title": "Josh James (baseball)",
        "text": "Joshua James (born March 8, 1993) is an American professional baseball pitcher in the St. Louis Cardinals organization. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Houston Astros. He played college baseball at Barry University and Western Oklahoma State College before being selected in the 34th round of the 2014 MLB draft, and is best known for his fastball, which has reached 102 miles per hour.\nEarly life.\nJoshua Edward James was born to Ivan and Tricia James on March 8, 1993, in Hollywood, Florida. James' father, Ivan, is Puerto Rican and grew up on the island of St. Croix. James' mother, Tricia, was born on St. Thomas. James spent part of his childhood in the U.S. Virgin Islands along with his sister Joy.\nJames attended South Broward High School in Hollywood, Florida, a marine science magnet school, where he was a three-year letterman. There, he was primarily an infielder and did not begin pitching until the age of 16. One of his teammates at South Broward was Jose Marmolejos, who would also go on to play Major League Baseball for the Washington Nationals and Seattle Mariners. In addition to baseball, James was a member of the basketball, golf, and track teams at South Broward. He also briefly played tennis.\nAt Barry University in Miami Shores, Florida, James' coaches converted him to a pitcher exclusively, but he only pitched five innings in 2012. He majored in Sport Management while at Barry. After his freshman year, James decided to pursue another collegiate opportunity, citing a lack of playing time and an inability to secure a scholarship at Barry. Though he initially was seeking a program in his home state of Florida, James eventually transferred to Western Oklahoma State College, a NJCAA DII college in Altus, Oklahoma. He was put into contact with Western Oklahoma coach Kurt Russel through one of his former coaches in the Virgin Islands, Darren Canton. Prior to James' arrival at Western Oklahoma, the Pioneers had qualified for five straight NCJAA DII World Series, winning a national championship in 2011 and losing in the championship game in 2012. Other WOSC alumni who played in MLB include Andrelton Simmons, Casey Sadler, Juan Perez, and Angel Castro. While at Western Oklahoma, James attempted to switch back to the infielder position but was informed by his coaches that he would find more success as a pitcher. He redshirted the 2013 season and returned as a member of the Pioneers' starting rotation in 2014, posting a 3.21 ERA and gathering 56 strikeouts in 61.2 innings. Following the 2014 season, James committed to transferring to Lynn University, a Division II school in Boca Raton, Florida.\nCareer.\nMinor leagues.\nThe Houston Astros selected James in the 34th round of the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, with the 1,006th overall pick. James made his professional debut in 2014 with the Greeneville Astros and spent the whole season there, going 1–3 with a 2.72 ERA in 39.2 innings pitched. In 2015, he pitched with the Quad Cities River Bandits where he was 7–4 with a 2.63 ERA in 24 games (18 starts). In 2016 he was promoted to the Lancaster JetHawks where he posted a 9–5 record and a 4.81 ERA in 23 games (19 starts), and in 2017, he went 4–8 with a 4.38 ERA in 21 games, 11 which were starts, with the Double-AA Corpus Christi Hooks.\nAfter starting the 2018 season with Corpus Christi, James was promoted to the AAA Fresno Grizzlies during the season. With the two teams he was 6–4 with a 3.23 ERA, and 171 strikeouts in 114.1 innings (13.5 per 9 innings). James was named the Astros' Minor League Pitcher of the Year for 2018.\nDuring the 2018 season, James saw a jump in his velocity, which he credited to a recent sleep apnea diagnosis. His roommate in rookie ball in 2014, Ryan Thompson, complained often about James' incessant snoring, saying, \"He was like a chainsaw taking down a national forest.\" James consulted a sleep specialist in December 2016 and was diagnosed with sleep apnea. After he began using a CPAP machine, James said he felt \"just a little bit more refreshed in the morning, a little bit more refreshed about the day, and slowly I started feeling a little bit better every day.\" This translated into a gradual increase in his fastball velocity, growing from 94 to 95 miles per hour to 100 miles per hour.\nHouston Astros.\nJames was promoted to the major leagues for the first time on September 1, 2018, becoming the lowest drafted pitcher in Houston Astros history to make a start for the team. In 2018 with the Astros, he was 2–0 with a 2.35 ERA, in six games (three starts) in which he pitched 23.0 innings and struck out 29 batters. (11.3 strikeouts per 9 innings). James was on the American League Division Series roster but did not see any playing time against the Cleveland Indians. In the 2018 American League Championship Series, James pitched 4.1 innings, giving up 6 hits and 4 runs and striking out 7.\nIn game 4 of the 2018 ALCS, James recorded his highest velocity fastball, clocking in at 102.4 miles per hour and striking out Rafael Devers.\nIn 2019 with the Astros, he transitioned from the starting rotation to the bullpen. On July 15, James served in an opener role, pitching a 1-2-3 first inning and recording one strikeout. On September 3, 2019, he recorded his first career save against the Milwaukee Brewers. He ended the 2019 season 5–1 with a 4.70 ERA in 49 games in which he pitched innings and struck out 100 batters (14.7 per 9 innings). James was also a part of the ALDS, ALCS, and World Series rosters and is formally credited with the win in game 3 of the World Series, making him one of only 10 pitchers in Astros history to record a World Series win as of November 2022.\nDuring spring training in 2020, James was part of a battle for the fifth spot in the starting rotation, a role he eventually won. After arriving to the pre-season camp late due to the birth of his daughter, James made two starts at the beginning of the delayed 2020 season before transitioning back to the bullpen. On August 20, he left a game against the Colorado Rockies with left hip discomfort and was placed on the 10-day injured list on August 22. James was activated on September 9 and posted a 1.35 ERA and 0.90 WHIP over his 6.2 innings of work in the month of September. He was placed on the COVID injured list due to health and safety protocols on September 25. On the year, he went 1–0 with a 7.27 ERA with 21 strikeouts in innings (10.9 strikeouts per 9 innings), over 13 games. In his 4.0 innings of work in the 2020 postseason, he allowed 5 hits and 4 runs. Notably, James gave up a game-tying home run to Ji-man Choi in Game 5 of the 2020 American League Championship Series.\nOn October 24, 2020, it was announced that James had undergone surgery to repair a labral tear in his left hip and would be out for 6–8 months. In a spring training broadcast in March 2022, it would be revealed that James had also received a PRP injection in his right elbow at this time. Originally set to return between late May and early June, he was retroactively placed on the 60-day injured list on May 26, 2021, as he continued to recover from the surgery. After completing rehab assignments with the Fayetteville Woodpeckers and Sugar Land Skeeters in the month of July, James was activated off the injured list on August 1 and optioned to Triple-A Sugar Land. In his 20.2 innings in the minors in 2021, he allowed 7 earned runs and struck out 28. James was recalled on August 31 and was optioned back to Triple-A on September 5. He was optioned and recalled two more times in the month of September. James had a 5.40 ERA in his 5.0 major league innings in 2021. In his final appearance of the year for Sugar Land on October 3, he gave up 3 runs and left the game with an injury after hitting a 20 pitch limit.\nJames avoided arbitration with the Astros on March 22, 2022, agreeing to a $800,000 contract for the season.\nOn March 30, 2022, James was optioned to Triple-A Sugar Land, now called the Space Cowboys, after two major league spring training appearances. On April 10, he closed out the team's first win since rebranding, simultaneously picking up his first save of the year. On June 15, James left a Sugar Land game with an injury and was placed on the 7-day injured list with a right lat strain on June 21 before being placed on the 60-day injured list on the 23rd. He began a rehab assignment with the Fayetteville Woodpeckers on August 25, striking out the side in his 1.0 inning of work. After making 7 rehab appearances (2 in Fayetteville and 5 in Sugar Land), James left the September 13th Sugar Land game with an apparent injury, indicated by a dropoff in his fastball velocity. On October 1, it was announced that James had undergone surgery on his right flexor tendon.\nOn November 18, 2022, the Astros non-tendered James, making him a free agent.\nSt. Louis Cardinals.\nOn January 26, 2024, James signed a minor league contract with the St. Louis Cardinals and was assigned to the AAA Memphis Redbirds.\nPersonal life.\nJames has many tattoos, including a partial sleeve on his left arm. The bible verse Psalms 119:105 is tattooed on his right forearm. The verse reads, \"Thy Word Is a Lamp Unto My Feet and Light Unto My Path.\" Several other tattoos honor his roots in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the date of his Major League debut (9.1.18) is inked on his right tricep. James is a devoted Miami Heat fan and has a tattoo of the team's logo. James also has a bicep tattoo of the Florida Marlins logo, though he has stated that he was a fan of the New York Yankees growing up, citing Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez as his favorite players.\nIn the offseason, James resides in Southwest Florida with his wife, Gabrielle (née Lopez), and their children. James and Lopez began dating in November 2013 while both were enrolled at Western Oklahoma State College and playing on the baseball and softball teams respectively. They eventually married in January 2022 in Beaver Creek, Colorado. The couple has four children, Noah (born November 2018), Sophia (born July 2020), and fraternal twins Avery and Jace (born October 2022). In November 2022, the family announced that Jace had died at 23 days days old."

        "text": "The 2019 SummerSlam was the 32nd annual SummerSlam professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions. The event took place on August 11, 2019, at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and was the second SummerSlam held at this venue after the 2004 event and the first held outside of New York since 2014.\n12 matches were contested at the event, including three on the Kickoff pre-show. In the main event, Seth Rollins defeated Brock Lesnar to win Raw's Universal Championship for a second time. In the penultimate match, Bray Wyatt debuted his new \"Fiend\" persona and defeated Finn Bálor. In other prominent matches, Charlotte Flair defeated WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus by submission, Kevin Owens defeated Shane McMahon to keep his job, SmackDown's WWE Champion Kofi Kingston fought Randy Orton to a double countout thus Kingston retained the title, and Goldberg defeated Dolph Ziggler.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSummerSlam is an annual pay-per-view (PPV) and WWE Network event produced every August by WWE since 1988. Dubbed \"The Biggest Party of the Summer\", it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and Survivor Series, referred to as the \"Big Four\". It has since become considered WWE's second biggest event of the year behind WrestleMania. Announced on August 27, 2018, the 2019 event was the 32nd SummerSlam and was scheduled to be held on August 11, 2019, at the Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, being the second SummerSlam to be held at this particular venue, after the 2004 event. It featured wrestlers from the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brand divisions.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised 12 matches, including three on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, in which wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw, SmackDown, and 205 Live brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\", \"SmackDown Live\", and the cruiserweight-exclusive \"205 Live\".\nAt WrestleMania 35, Seth Rollins defeated Brock Lesnar to win the Universal Championship. Lesnar then disappeared from television for several weeks before inserting himself in the 2019 Money in the Bank ladder match and won, earning a match for a world championship of his choice at any time within the next year. After teasing some cash-ins, Lesnar finally cashed in his Money in the Bank contract at Extreme Rules and won back the Universal Championship right after Rollins had just retained the title. On the following night's \"Raw\", Rollins won a cross-brand 10-man battle royal to earn a rematch against Lesnar at SummerSlam. During \"Raw Reunion\" on July 22, Lesnar's advocate Paul Heyman stated that Lesnar cashed in on Rollins because Rollins had done the same to Lesnar back at WrestleMania 31 in March 2015.\nOn the July 15 episode of \"Raw\", Natalya won a fatal four-way elimination match to determine the number one contender against Becky Lynch for the Raw Women's Championship at SummerSlam. After Lynch's match on the July 29 episode, Natalya applied the Sharpshooter on Lynch and later suggested a submission match, which was made official the following week.\nOn the July 16 episode of \"SmackDown\", after SmackDown Women's Champion Bayley and Ember Moon won their tag team match in which Moon scored the pin, Bayley selected Moon as the number one contender for her title at SummerSlam.\nDuring the summer of 2019, Kevin Owens became furious with Shane McMahon due to the latter taking up more and more screen time each week from other wrestlers and exerting even more authority, which was in contradiction to what The McMahon Family (Vince McMahon, Stephanie McMahon, Shane McMahon, and Triple H) had promised several months prior. Despite Shane's attempts to ban Owens from \"SmackDown\", Owens would nevertheless show up and attack Shane at opportune moments. During \"Raw Reunion\" on July 22, Owens challenged Shane to a match at SummerSlam and said he would quit the WWE if he were to lose, and Shane accepted.\nOn the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", WWE Champion Kofi Kingston selected Randy Orton as his next title defense at SummerSlam. Kingston referenced their past rivalry in 2009 where Kingston defeated Orton, but claimed that Orton used his influence to keep Kingston out of the main event scene. Orton stated that he was right that he held Kingston back and accepted the challenge. Orton also claimed credit for Kingston becoming WWE Champion, as it was Orton who had injured Ali, who Kingston had replaced in the WWE Championship match at Elimination Chamber, which led to Kingston winning the title at WrestleMania 35.\nFollowing the Superstar Shake-up in April, Bray Wyatt, who had been on hiatus since the previous summer, began appearing as an eerie children's entertainer in pre-taped segments called \"Firefly Fun Fouse\". He eventually revealed a new sinister alternate persona called \"The Fiend\". After wild card guest Finn Bálor's match on the July 15 episode of \"Raw\", the lights went out and Wyatt appeared as \"The Fiend\" and attacked Bálor. The following week on \"SmackDown\", Bálor challenged Wyatt to a match at SummerSlam. Wyatt appeared inside the Fun House and stated that he was a fan of Bálor, however, \"The Fiend\" was not and that \"The Fiend\" accepted the challenge.\nAt Extreme Rules, AJ Styles defeated Ricochet to win the United States Championship thanks to help from his O.C. teammates, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. On the July 29 episode of \"Raw\", Ricochet won a gauntlet match, to earn a rematch for the title at SummerSlam.\nOn the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", WWE Hall of Famer Shawn Michaels' appearance on \"Miz TV\" was interrupted by Dolph Ziggler, who insulted Michaels. The Miz intervened but was pulled back by Michaels. Ziggler then attempted to punch Michaels, but accidentally struck Miz instead and then superkicked Michaels. The following week, a match between Miz and Ziggler was scheduled for SummerSlam, however, during the contract signing on the August 5 episode of \"Raw\", Miz revealed that their match would actually take place on the following \"Raw\" and that Ziggler would fight someone else at SummerSlam. Ziggler presumed that this referred to Michaels but instead, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg (whom Ziggler disparaged in his promos against Michaels) appeared and was revealed as Ziggler's opponent.\nBackstage during the July 23 episode of \"SmackDown\", Charlotte Flair voiced her displeasure that she was not scheduled to compete at SummerSlam. Despite not being on the card, Flair stated she would be part of SummerSlam to prove that she was the \"greatest female superstar of all-time\". The following week, WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus was a guest on Jerry Lawler's \"King's Court\". They were interrupted by Flair, who challenged Stratus to a match at SummerSlam. After disparaging comments from Flair, Stratus accepted the challenge.\nOn the August 6 episode of \"205 Live\", Oney Lorcan won a six-pack challenge to earn the right to face Drew Gulak for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nThree matches were contested on the SummerSlam Kickoff pre-show. In the first match, Drew Gulak defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Oney Lorcan. In the end, Gulak performed a \"Cyclone Crash\" to retain the title.\nNext, Buddy Murphy faced Apollo Crews. In the end, Murphy was attacked by Rowan—who Murphy had accused of attacking Roman Reigns on recent episodes of \"Raw\" and \"SmackDown\"—thus Murphy won via disqualification. Following the match, Rowan continued to attack Murphy at ringside and performed a powerbomb on Murphy onto the ring apron.\nFollowing that, Elias performed a song insulting Toronto which prompted Toronto native and WWE Hall of Famer Edge to interrupt Elias. After trading some insults, Edge performed a \"Spear\" on Elias.\nIn the final pre-show match, Alexa Bliss and Nikki Cross defended the WWE Women's Tag Team Championship against The IIconics (Billie Kay and Peyton Royce). In the end, Bliss performed \"Twisted Bliss\" on Royce to retain the titles.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the submission match in which Becky Lynch defended the Raw Women's Championship against Natalya. During the match, Lynch applied a \"Sharpshooter\" of her own on Natalya, however, Natalya immediately fired back with a \"Dis-Arm-Her\" of her own. In the climax, Natalya applied the sharpshooter again, only for Lynch to counter and apply the \"Dis-Arm-Her\", forcing Natalya to submit to retain the title.\nNext, Goldberg faced Dolph Ziggler. As soon as the match began, Ziggler performed a superkick on Goldberg for a one-count. Ziggler performed a second superkick on Goldberg for another one-count. As Ziggler attempted a third, Goldberg performed a \"Spear\" followed by a \"Jackhammer\" on Ziggler to win the match in under two minutes. Following the match, Ziggler taunted Goldberg, who responded by performing another \"Spear\" on Ziggler. After Goldberg went backstage, Ziggler taunted him again, prompting Goldberg to return and perform one final \"Spear\" on Ziggler.\nAfter that, The O.C.'s AJ Styles (accompanied by his O.C. members Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) defended the United States Championship against Ricochet. In the end, as Ricochet attempted a Phoenix splash on Styles, Styles countered into a \"Styles Clash\" to retain the title. Following the match, Gallows and Anderson performed the \"Magic Killer\" on Ricochet.\nIn the fourth match, Bayley defended the SmackDown Women's Championship against Ember Moon. In the end, Bayley performed a \"Bayley-to-Belly\" on Moon from the top rope to retain the title.\nAfter that, Kevin Owens put his WWE career on the line against Shane McMahon. Before the match began, Shane introduced Elias as the special guest enforcer. During the match, Elias distracted Owens, allowing Shane to attack Owens with multiple cheap shots. Shane countered a pop-up powerbomb attempt with a DDT for a near-fall. Owens eventually performed a pop-up powerbomb on Shane, only for Elias to pull the referee out from the ring. Owens then attacked Elias, which also incapacitated the referee. Owens further attacked Elias with multiple chair shots. With the referee down, Owens performed a low blow and a stunner on Shane to win the match and keep his job.\nNext, Charlotte Flair faced Trish Stratus. During the match, Stratus applied her own figure-four leglock on Flair followed by the \"Figure-Eight Leglock\". Stratus performed a \"Stratusfaction\" for a near-fall. In the end, Flair performed a \"Big Boot\" on Stratus and forced Stratus to submit to the \"Figure-Eight Leglock\" to win the match. After the match, Stratus was given a standing ovation.\nAfter that, Kofi Kingston defended the WWE Championship against Randy Orton. Orton delivered multiple side slams to Kingston on the broadcast tables. As Orton went for a superplex, Kingston countered into a tornado DDT for a near-fall. Orton eventually performed an \"RKO\" in midair on Kingston, however, Kingston rolled out of the ring. Outside the ring, Orton taunted Kingston's family, who were in the front row, and a brawl ensued between Kingston and Orton at ringside. Both were counted out, thus Kingston retained the title, and Kingston continued to beat down Orton.\nIn the penultimate match, Finn Bálor faced off against Bray Wyatt's new persona, \"The Fiend\". \"The Fiend\" dominated the match. In the end, \"The Fiend\" countered a \"Coup de Grace\" from Bálor into the Mandible claw, causing Bálor to pass out and allow \"The Fiend\" to get the pinfall victory.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman) defended the Universal Championship against Seth Rollins. At the start of the match, Rollins rolled out of a Suplex attempt and performed \"The Stomp\" for a near-fall. Rollins then performed two Superkicks and attempted another \"Stomp\", but Lesnar caught Rollins with an \"F-5\". Lesnar performed multiple German and Vertical suplexes on Rollins. Outside the ring, Rollins performed a Frog Splash on Lesnar through the Spanish announce table, and then another Frog Splash and a second \"Stomp\" in the ring for a nearfall. In the end, as Rollins attempted a third \"Stomp\", Lesnar caught him and attempted a second \"F-5\", however, Rollins countered and performed a third Superkick and a third \"Stomp\" on Lesnar to win the match by pinfall, winning the title, and giving him his first singles clean defeat as defending world champion in WWE.\nReception.\nThe event received fairly positive reviews. Jason Powell of \"Pro Wrestling Dot Net\" described SummerSlam as \"a solid show overall that closed with a satisfying title change\". He described the main event as \"a good match\", saying that \"Lesnar had his supporters in the crowd, but it seemed like Rollins won over some of his detractors as the match went on. The injury angle made some of Lesnar's offense seem even more punishing\".\nPowell also gave the Wyatt-Bálor match a positive review and said that \"Wyatt's Fiend persona came off very well and the live crowd clearly loved it\". Powell criticized the Kingston-Orton match finish and called it \"weak\" while saying that it was \"a lousy finish to a decent match that was poorly executed\". Powell described the Goldberg-Ziggler bout as \"a fun Goldberg-style match. I love that they started it with Dolph getting the surprising offense before Goldberg did what felt inevitable. This was a nice redemption moment for Goldberg after he suffered the concussion and his match with Undertaker fell apart in Saudi Arabia, not to mention that the Canadian fans weren't still holding a grudge over booting Bret Hart in the head\".\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nThe following night on \"Raw\", new Universal Champion Seth Rollins thanked the fans for their support before being interrupted by The O.C. (United States Champion AJ Styles and Raw Tag Team Champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson). Styles claimed to be the better champion and challenged Rollins to a champion versus champion non-title match, which ended in a disqualification due to interference from Gallows and Anderson. Ricochet and Braun Strowman ran out to make the save. Also on the show, Paul Heyman said that he was informed by WWE officials that Brock Lesnar would not be granted a rematch for the Universal Championship. The following week, Rollins and Strowman defeated Gallows and Anderson to win the Raw Tag Team Championship.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Raw Women's Champion Becky Lynch said she respected Natalya and put out a warning to the rest of the women's division. Natalya later came out with her arm in a sling and declared that she would face Lynch again. She was interrupted by the returning Sasha Banks, who last appeared at WrestleMania 35. After hugging and consoling Natalya, Banks attacked her, thus turning heel. Lynch came out for the save, but was attacked by Banks with a steel chair. Banks again attacked Natalya backstage the following week. A match between Banks and Natalya took place on the August 26 episode, where Banks won. The following week, Banks challenged Lynch for the Raw Women's Championship at Clash of Champions, and Lynch accepted.\nDolph Ziggler had his match with The Miz, which he also lost. After the match, Ziggler taunted Miz, who performed a \"Skull Crushing Finale\" on Ziggler.\nSmackDown.\nFollowing their SummerSlam match, Shane McMahon fined Kevin Owens US$100,000 for attacking a designated official, Elias, who was again appointed as the special guest enforcer for Owens' match against Samoa Joe where Elias cost Owens the match by making a fast three count. After several more weeks of feuding, Shane ultimately fired Owens. Owens then threatened Shane with a lawsuit for wrongful termination, which in turn resulted in Owens challenging Shane to a ladder match where if Shane won, Owens would drop the lawsuit and leave the WWE for good, but if Owens won, Shane would be gone. Shane accepted and the match was scheduled for \"SmackDown's 20th Anniversary\" on October 4, where Owens won.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\", The New Day (WWE Champion Kofi Kingston and SmackDown Tag Team Champions Big E and Xavier Woods) faced Randy Orton and The Revival (Scott Dawson and Dash Wilder) in a six-man tag team match where Orton and The Revival won. Following the match, Orton performed an RKO on all three members of The New Day. On the August 19 episode of \"Raw\", Big E and Woods defeated The Revival via disqualification after interference from Orton. Afterwards, Kingston came to The New Day's aid, only for Orton to attack Kingston, while The Revival and Orton injured Woods' leg. On August 27, a rematch between Kingston and Orton for the WWE Championship was scheduled for Clash of Champions, while Big E and Woods were also scheduled to defend the SmackDown Tag Team Championship against The Revival at the event.\nAlso on \"SmackDown\", Daniel Bryan and Rowan forced Buddy Murphy to reveal that he was lying in saying that Rowan was Roman Reigns' attacker. Later on the show, Bryan and Rowan revealed that they conducted their own investigation to find out who attacked Reigns. The following week, they claimed that the attacker was a man who merely resembled Rowan. On the August 27 episode, however, Reigns found additional footage that Rowan was seen tipping over the equipment. This caused Bryan and Rowan to split due to Rowan lying, and a no disqualification match between Reigns and Rowan was scheduled for Clash of Champions.\nCharlotte Flair followed up with her win over Trish Stratus at SummerSlam with a win over Ember Moon on the following episode of \"SmackDown\". The following week, Flair issued a challenge to Bayley for the SmackDown Women's Championship at Clash of Champions, which Bayley accepted.\n205 Live.\nOn \"205 Live\", Oney Lorcan had a rematch against Drew Gulak for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship, however, Gulak retained the title.\nThe 2019 SummerSlam would be the final SummerSlam to feature the 205 Live brand, as in October, 205 Live and the WWE Cruiserweight Championship were merged under the NXT umbrella."

        "text": "The men's pole vault at the 2018 European Athletics Championships took place at the Olympic Stadium on 10 and 12 August.\nRecords.\n \nThe following national records were established during the competition:\nSummary.\nThe top five European vaulters, all in the top eight in the world, all met in this competition. World record holder Renaud Lavillenie came in ranked #2 in the world for 2018. Paweł Wojciechowski collected misses first, then at 5.80m, eighteen year old Armand Duplantis missed once and Lavillenie missed twice before passing, leaving Piotr Lisek and Timur Morgunov retaining a perfect record to that point, with the lead. Wojciechowski topped out at 5.80m, while Lavillenie redeemed himself with a clearance of 5.85m in his one remaining attempt. Lisek missed once at 5.85m then passed while Morgunov remained perfect to take over the lead. Lisek, Duplantis and Morgunov all took 5.90m on their first attempt, Lavillenie passed and elected to take his next attempt at 5.95m. At 5.95m, Duplantis cleared first, improving his own World under 20 (Junior) record. He took over the lead when Morgunov missed for the first time in the competition. Lavillenie made his first attempt to move into second place (with two misses to Duplantis' one). Morgunov and Lisek passed after their first misses at 5.95m, taking four athletes to attempt the magic 6 meters.\nLisek missed, then Duplantis made it on his first attempt, becoming the youngest athlete to join the 6 metres club, setting the World under 20 record for the second time in the competition. As the next jumper, Morgunov became the 24th member of the club with his first attempt clearance and he moved into a tie for the lead. Lavillenie missed his first attempt and passed, then Lisek bowed out of the competition with his second miss bringing three athletes to the next prescribed height of 6.05m, a height only five athletes had ever cleared. On his first attempt, Duplantis sailed well over the bar and became the sixth, again improving his U20 record from minutes earlier, the third time in the competition, taking the lead. With his success, it was hugs from all the leading members of the pole vault fraternity, save Morgunov who was on the runway preparing for his next attempt. Neither Morgunov or Lavillenie could clear 6.05m, leaving Duplantis with gold, Morgunov with silver and Lavillenie with bronze. Duplantis chose not to make any more attempts at a higher height. Duplantis also broke Rodion Gataullin's 24 year old European championship record which both he and Morgunov had tied at 6 metres.\nResults.\nQualification.\nQualification: 5.66 m (Q) or best 12 performances (q)"

        "text": "The Australia–New Zealand bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup, also known as the AsOne bid, was the successful bid to host the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup made by Football Federation Australia (FFA) and New Zealand Football (NZF). The joint bid was announced on 12 December 2019, combining an already launched effort from Australia that began on 29 October 2018. The bid entailed 13 venues in 12 host cities, with a final played in Sydney at Stadium Australia.\nBackground.\nAfter successfully staging the 2015 AFC Asian Cup, speculation that FFA would bid to host a World Cup in Australia intensified. A joint announcement signalling the intent to bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup was made by the Federal Government and FFA on 13 June 2017.\nFFA previously showed interest in bidding for the 2003 FIFA Women's World Cup but ultimately lost despite being one of two \"excellent bids\" with the FIFA Committee for Women's Football deciding to recommend China. Similar circumstances saw FFA show interest in bidding for the 2011 edition, however then-CEO Ben Buckley submitted a formal letter to FIFA withdrawing from the formal bidding process.\nWith the release of the Whole of Football Plan in 2014, the FFA referenced bidding for a FIFA Women's World Cup as part of the women's football 10 year strategy. A breakthrough year in 2017 for the Matildas, who claimed the inaugural 2017 Tournament of Nations, increased support for a potential bid. A series of friendly matches against Brazil and China in late 2017 attracted approximately 50,000 fans to see the Matildas, who were subsequently voted by the public as the \"Team of the Year\" at the AIS Awards.\nBid development.\nOn 13 June 2017, the Australian Government provided $1 million initial funding for a feasibility study of the chances of a bid being successful. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull voiced his government's support for the bid, stating that the Matildas \"are wonderful role models for young women and girls right across Australia.\" A further $4 million was provided on 6 February 2018 by the federal government, which FFA CEO David Gallop proclaimed would \"bring enormous benefits to the Australian community, not only promoting healthy, active lifestyles but inclusion and gender equality.\" Premier of NSW Gladys Berejiklian launched plans to attract some of the biggest sporting events in the world to NSW over the next decade, which includes the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe bid was officially launched on 29 October 2018 with the campaign slogan \"#GetOnside\". The bid logo and slogan \"Limitless\" was launched on 7 July 2019. The logo stylizes the blue-green outlines to form Australia with a football.\nAddition of New Zealand to bid.\nWith FIFA's plan to expand the field to 32 teams, a joint Australian–New Zealand bid was announced to be under consideration in July 2019. On 10 December 2019, shortly before the FIFA bid deadline, FFA and NZF announced an agreement to submit a joint bid with 13 stadiums in 12 host cities, the same day launched its bid logo in stylized football with a light blue \"AU\" curves symbolise Australia and a light green \"NZ\" also with curves symbolises New Zealand below 2023.\nIt was reported in 2019 that the countries would theoretically host four groups each (24 games each), and in the later stages, New Zealand would host 5 knockout games and Australia 11 games including the final at Stadium Australia in Sydney following its general renovation.\nFIFA football tournament hosting experiences.\nIn addition, Australia also held the 1956 Olympic football tournament, the 2000 Olympic football tournament and the 2015 AFC Asian Cup\nProposed venues.\nThe following host cities, venues and capacities were included in the Bid Book submitted to FIFA:\nResult.\nThe Australia-New Zealand bid won hosting rights to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup on 25 June 2020. In a vote of 35 eligible members of the FIFA Council, the bid received 22 votes to Colombia's 13. FIFA President Gianni Infantino voted for the bid, alongside all council members from the Asian and Oceanian confederations, as well as those from CONCACAF and the Confederation of African Football. Council members from CONMEBOL and UEFA voted for the Colombian bid."

        "text": "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup bidding process was the process used by FIFA to select the host for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. There were two bids from three countries that sought to host the 2023 FIFA's Women's World Cup. The final bids submitted were from Australia–New Zealand and Colombia. On 25 June 2020, the combined Australia and New Zealand bid officially won the bid to host the Women's World Cup.\nBid process.\nThe bidding timeline was adjusted following the confirmation of the expanded tournament.\nThe key dates of the bidding process were:\nOfficial bids.\nTwo additional bids, from Brazil and Japan respectively, were also confirmed by FIFA on 13 December 2019 as having submitted the required registration to FIFA, but later withdrew.\nAFC–OFC.\nNo men's or women's FIFA World Cup has been hosted by two or more countries in different confederations. Asia has hosted the tournament twice, in 1991 and 2007, both in China. Oceania has never hosted the tournament.\nIn 2017 it was first announced that the Australian Government was funding a feasibility study to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. Further funding was put into the bid in early 2018 by Federal Minister for Sport Bridget McKenzie as the government confirmed they were pledging an extra A$4 million for it. The bid was officially launched on 29 October 2018 with the campaign slogan \"#GetOnside\". Australia unveiled its logo and slogan: \"Limitless\" launched on 8 July 2019.\nBefore their hosting of the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, New Zealand officials expressed interest in bidding for the hosting rights of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. FIFA's director of tournaments, Colin Smith, called New Zealand a \"major contender\" to host the Women's World Cup should it bid. On 25 February 2019 New Zealand Football announced that it will put forward to bid for 2023.\nThe two countries announced that they would submit a joint bid on 12 December 2019. The combined bid with the slogan \"AsOne\" featured 13 stadiums in 12 cities, with the opening match to be played at the Eden Park in Auckland, and the final to take place at Stadium Australia in Sydney.\nCONMEBOL.\nSouth America has never hosted the tournament. In 2016 the Colombian Football Federation indicated an interest to formalize the candidacy of Colombia as host country. Colombia previously hosted the 2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup and the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup. One of the requirements to host the World Cup was to have a national women's league, and in 2017 the Colombian Women's Football League played its first season. On 26 January 2019, Colombian President Iván Duque Márquez indicated that he had every intention of applying for Colombia to host the 2023 Women's World Cup.\nBid evaluation report.\nThe bid evaluation was released by FIFA on 10 June 2020. The Australia-New Zealand bid earned the highest score with 4.1 out of 5, and identified as \"[appearing] to present the most commercially favourable proposition\" to FIFA. It was followed by Japan with a score of 3.8, though that bid was withdrawn after the evaluation's publication.\nColombia earned a score of 2.8, with FIFA noting that the Colombian bid would require \"a significant amount of investment and support from both local stakeholders and FIFA\" to elevate the bid to the level of the other two, and that \"it is not clear if this level of investment will be available\".\nWithdrawn bids.\nAFC.\nJapan considered bidding on the tournament after declining its initial intention to bid on the 2019 FIFA Women's World Cup. Japan Football Association vice president Kozo Tashima is reported to have said that the facilities will be renovated and ready for the World Cup. On 20 February 2019 The Japan Football Association announced that it will go forward with a long-planned bid to host the 2023 Women's World Cup. On 5 July 2019 Japan unveiled its bid logo along with the slogan \"Time to Fly\". The bid included eight stadiums, including several venues that are set to play host to the 2020 Summer Olympics football tournament.\nThough it was included on the final bid list, the JFA withdrew its bid to host the tournament on 22 June 2020, citing Brazil's withdrawal as unifying the CONMEBOL vote for Colombia, ASEAN Football Federation's backing of Australia and New Zealand, and the unlikelihood of its bid being successful due to the delayed Tokyo 2020 women's football tournament, as the Olympics being postponed to 2021. The JFA also suggested that without the burden of hosting the tournament, it could provide more resources to its national team in the hope of winning the tournament. After Japan's withdrawal, the Asian Football Confederation endorsed the Australia-New Zealand bid.\nCONMEBOL.\nBrazil formally submitted its bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup on 13 December 2019. The Brazilian Football Confederation had planned to use eight stadiums in eight cities in this bid – all of which were used in tournaments such as the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, 2014 FIFA World Cup, 2016 Summer Olympics and 2019 Copa América. According to the bid, the final would have been played in the Maracanã Stadium, in Rio de Janeiro.\nThough it was included in the final bid list, the Brazilian Football Confederation withdrew its bid on 8 June 2020, citing an inability to provide federal government guarantees due to \"economic and fiscal austerity\" stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.\nPotential bids.\nArgentina formally submitted an expression of interest, but was not included among the final bids submitted.\nBelgium was listed as candidates on FIFA's list in August 2019, but was no longer on the updated list in September 2019.\nBolivia was listed as a candidate on FIFA's list in August 2019, but was no longer on the updated list in September 2019.\nOn 4 June 2018, the South African Football Association (SAFA) announced its intent to bid for the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup that had never been hosted in Africa before. South Africa agreed to officially launch the bid after South Africa qualified for the 2019 Women's World Cup, its first time at the finals. On 21 February 2019, South Africa announced it will put forward to the 2023 bid. SAFA announced its withdrawal of the 2023 bid on 11 December 2019, stating its intent to prioritise the domestic game, but said that it would consider a bid for the 2027 tournament.\nOn 4 March 2019, the Korea Football Association (KFA) announced that South Korea was planning a joint bid with North Korea to host the 2023 event and hopes to be the first to be hosted by more than one country. The joint bid was proposed by FIFA president Gianni Infantino, but was deemed infeasible due to the relations between the two countries. The joint bid and potential solo bid were withdrawn on 13 December 2019, having no agreement made between FIFA and the national government over the use of an organizing committee.\n2023 Women's World Cup host election results.\nA decision was made by 35 of the 37 members of the FIFA Council; two members, from Colombia and New Zealand respectively, were ineligible to vote as they were bidding nations. Voting was originally scheduled to be by secret ballot (on the assumption of a face-to-face meeting), with results to publish after the vote. As such it was a different format to the voting process for the 2026 Men's World Cup, which saw all eligible FIFA member associations receive one vote each.\nThe results of the voting are shown in the accompanying table."

        "text": "The 2018 Group 10 Rugby League season was the 72nd season of premier competition of rugby league in the Central West area of New South Wales. It was run under the auspices of the Country Rugby League. It was the sixth consecutive season to feature nine teams, after the re-admittance of the Blayney Bears in 2013.\nOrange CYMS entered the season as defending champions, after defeating Oberon Tigers 23–22 in the 2017 premier league decider. CYMS rallied from 22–8 down with 20 minutes remaining to claim the one-point victory. On the back of off-season recruits which included former South Sydney, Manly and Newcastle forward Josh Starling, Oberon Tigers were labelled the early premiership favourites.\nPremier League season summary.\nEighteen rounds were contested from April until August, resulting in the top of Cowra Magpies, Orange Hawks, Orange CYMS, Bathurst Panthers and Oberon Tigers. Cowra Magpies won their first minor premiership since 1996.\nSt Pat's played its first home game at the new Jack Arrow Sporting Complex on April 22, a 16–10 victory over Oberon Tigers. St Pat's originally left its spiritual home of Jack Arrow Oval, at the now Paddy's Hotel, at the end of the 2012 season. The club had been playing its home games at the Bathurst Sports Ground, next door to city rivals Panthers at Carrington Park.\nRound 10 was cancelled after snow closed roads to Oberon on June 17. Roads between Oberon and Bathurst were closed on the day, meaning Cowra Magpies were unable to travel to Oberon for their match against the Tigers. Games could have been played in Mudgee, Orange and Bathurst but Group 10 officials were hesitant to find itself in a situation where some games could have been played and some couldn't. Rescheduled mid-week games were not possible, due to being a logistical nightmare. All matches were scrapped and one point was awarded each. Because Orange CYMS had bye that weekend, a decision was made to scrap bye points in the second half of the season, so Orange CYMS wouldn't receive an unfair advantage.\nAfter 16 rounds, Orange Hawks looked likely to claim a first minor premiership since 2013 but after losing to Oberon Tigers 22–20 at Wade Park on August 5, Cowra Magpies jumped into first place after a massive 58–14 win over Mudgee Dragons at Sid Kallas Oval on the same day. Magpies won their final match of the home and away season, 34–16 against Lithgow Workies, to seal their first minor premiership since 1996.\nCowra captain Josh Rainbow was named the Group 10 player of the year on August 31, becoming just the fourth Cowra player to do so, the most recent Magpies player Dean Corrigan winning in 2009. Rainbow earned 17 votes, to finish ahead of Orange Hawks captain-coach Willie Heta with 14 and 2016 winner Jeremy Gordon with 11, Rainbow's fellow teammate who won the award with Bathurst Panthers.\nTeams\nLadder\nPlay-off bracket.\nThe Group 10 Rugby League finals use the top five McIntyre system:\nGrand Final.\nCowra Magpies hosted its first grand final since 2014, where they lost 34–12 to Bathurst St Pat's. The match will also be Bathurst Panthers first Group 10 premier league grand final since 2007, when they defeated Lithgow Workies 24–4 at Carrington Park.\nCowra hooker and former St Pat's hooker Benji John opened the scoring from dummy-half and Lee McClintock finished off a sweeping play from left to right to give the hosts a 10–0 lead inside the opening 13 minutes.\nIt became an arm wrestle and Panthers hung in, determined not to concede again. It was in the 57th when the deadlock was broken with Panthers’ lock Blake Hewitt crashing over and Willie Wright converted to reduce the deficit to 10–6.\nWith minutes remaining, still trailing 10–6, Panthers winger Andrew Mendes scored the equaliser and Wright’s opportunity arose. Having missed his aunty’s wedding to play the grand final, Wright made sure he slotted it, and from his boot, he knew it was going over.\nTo make it even sweeter, the successful conversion was struck directly in front of the Panthers faithful on the eastern side of the ground. The victory marked Panthers’ first Group 10 premier league title since 2007.\nHewitt lifted the Western Challenge Cup soon after and Panthers powerhouse Brent Seager was presented the Dave Scott Medal for player of the match.\nBathurst Panthers 12 (Blake Hewitt, Andrew Mendes tries; Willie Wright 2 conversions)\nCowra Magpies 10 (Benji John, Lee McClintock tries; Caley Mok conversion)"

        "title": "2021 Rugby World Cup",
        "text": "The 2021 Rugby World Cup was the ninth staging of the women's Rugby World Cup, as organised by World Rugby. It was held from 8 October to 12 November 2022 in Auckland and Whangārei, New Zealand. It was originally scheduled to be held in 2021, but was postponed by one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt was the first women's Rugby World Cup to be hosted by New Zealand, and by a country in the Southern Hemisphere. New Zealand were also the defending champions.\nThe tournament introduced changes such as replacement of classification play-offs in the knockout stage with quarter-finals, and a longer scheduling window with at least five days between matches. It was also the first to not be marketed by World Rugby as the \"Women's Rugby World Cup\", due to a decision to market both the men's and women's tournaments under the \"Rugby World Cup\" title with no disambiguation beginning in 2021.\nHost selection.\nOn 14 November 2018, World Rugby announced that New Zealand would host the 2021 Women's Rugby World Cup, beating out a competing bid by Australia—the only other country to officially submit a bid for the tournament. It was the first Women's Rugby World Cup to be hosted by a country in the Southern Hemisphere.\nIn November 2019, World Rugby announced that in an effort to create greater parity between the men's and women's Rugby World Cup, the Women's Rugby World Cup would be marketed as the \"Rugby World Cup\" with no gender designation beginning with the 2021 tournament.\nThe tournament was originally scheduled to be held from 18 September to 16 October 2021. On 2 March 2021, World Rugby announced that the tournament would be postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as \"it has become clear in recent discussions with key partners including New Zealand Rugby, the New Zealand government and participating unions, that, given the scale of the event and the COVID-19 related uncertainties, it is just not possible to deliver the environment for all teams to be the best that they can be on the sport's greatest stage.\" New Zealand's Zero-COVID policy at the time also meant that teams would have been subject to strict quarantine arrangements in order to enter the country, whose international borders were closed. The rescheduling also upholds the current practice of holding the women's Rugby World Cup in the year that follows the Summer Olympics, as the 2020 Summer Olympics were also postponed by one year to 2021 due to COVID-19.\nOn 12 May 2021, it was announced that the tournament had been rescheduled to 8 October through 12 November 2022; the window of the tournament was also extended and realigned to allow for at least five days rest between matches, as with the men's Rugby World Cup. All matches were scheduled on weekends. The tournament remained branded as the \"2021 Rugby World Cup\", but with a \"Playing in 2022\" subtitle.\nVenues.\nThe three venues are in the Auckland and Northland regions of Te Ika-a-Māui, the North Island. Three opening games were hosted at New Zealand's national stadium Eden Park. Eden Park also hosted the semi-finals, third place play-off and final. Other pool games and the quarter-finals were held at the Northland Events Centre and Waitakere Stadium.\nQualifying.\nNew Zealand, the host nation, had already qualified automatically winning the 2017 tournament before being announced as hosts. A further six teams (England, France, United States, Canada, Australia and Wales) qualified automatically as top seven finishers at the 2017 tournament. Scotland was announced as the winner of the repechage tournament on 25 February 2022.\nMatch officials.\nOn 26 May 2022, World Rugby announced the team of 18 officials from 11 unions for the World Cup, including an \"all-female team of referees.\" English official Sara Cox served in her fourth World Cup, while South African official Aimee Barrett-Theron and Irish official Joy Neville adjudicates in their second World Cups.\nOn 21 September 2022, World Rugby released the list of appointments for the pool phase—New Zealander Maggie Cogger-Orr was selected to oversee the opening match of the tournament.\nOn 8 November 2022, World Rugby announced that Scottish referee Hollie Davidson would adjudicate the final.\nReferees (9)\nAssistants (5)\nTelevision Match Officials (4)\nDraw.\nSeedings for the pools of the 2021 World Cup were based on the teams' World Rugby Rankings. The draw, hosted by sports pundit and former English and British and Irish Lions international Ugo Monye and sports journalist and presenter Elma Smit, was conducted on 20 November 2020 in the SkyCity Theatre in Auckland, and used the World Rankings as of 1 January 2020, before the global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is the first case in which the Women's World Cup was drawn based on World Rankings instead of classification from the previous World Cup. The automatic qualifiers from 2017 were allocated to their respective bands based on their rankings – and the remaining 5 qualifying places were allocated to Bands 3 and 4 based on previous World Cup playing strength:\nThis meant the 12 teams, qualified and qualifiers, were seeded thus:\nThe pools were respectively drawn by New Zealand Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, former Black Ferns internationals, Melodie Robinson and Farah Palmer and former All Blacks international, Dan Carter.\nSquads.\nEach team submitted a squad of 32 players for the tournament.\nPool stage.\nEach pool was a single round-robin of six games, in which each team played one match against each of the other teams in the same pool. Teams were awarded four points for a win, two points for a draw. A team that scored four or more tries earned a bonus point, as did a team that lost by fewer than eight points.\nThe tournament comprised twelve teams divided into three pools of four teams. The top two teams in each pool, as well as the best two third-placed teams progressed to the quarter-finals.\nFixtures were announced on 28 January 2021.\nIf two or more teams are tied on match points, the following tiebreakers applied;\nStatistics.\nSource:\nBroadcasting.\nSpark Sport will be the host broadcaster for the Rugby World Cup, broadcasting all matches live and on demand through its online streaming platform. Three will broadcast a selection of games free-to-air on New Zealand television."

Ties for medal positions were determined by sudden-death playoff involving the low-scoring foursome from each team involved.\nQualification.\nQualification for the Championships was via the European Golf Team Championships points tables for men and women, which were based on men's Official World Golf Ranking points and women's World Golf Rankings points earned from tournaments finishing between 10 July 2017 and 9 July 2018 with a maximum of three teams representing any one nation in each event."

        "text": "Michael Henry Dempsey (September 8, 1956 – April 29, 2009) was an American para table tennis player who competed in eight Paralympic Games. His best rank was world no.2 in class 4 in April 2001.\nBiography.\nWhen he was six months old, doctors discovered that Michael had a skin tumor on his back. A doctor gave him an injection to stop the growth but he had abnormalities with his legs as the tumor spread and attached onto his spinal cord resulting in loss of movement in his legs and was on a wheelchair for life.\nTable tennis career.\nBeginning.\nHe first started playing table tennis in 1969. He competed along with other wheelchair athletes \"according to function based on spinal cord injury level or comparable muscle strength\". Dempsey competed in the least disable category. The U.S. Wheelchair Champion John Gray took 13-year-old Dempsey to the National Wheelchair Games in 1969. He competed as an unseeded newcomer however he successfully won his first gold medal after beating Serge Jelenevsky for the gold medal; this was one of Dempsey's first of thirty golds that he won in his career.\n1970s and 1980s.\nIn the early 1970s, Dempsey kept improving on his table tennis skills by competing against able-bodied players in his training club in his hometown by taking part in local competitions. In July 1971, Dempsey took part in his first international competition: he won a gold medal in Kingston. He went on to win five more Pan-Am Singles Championships titles. Dempsey's practiced his table tennis skills with a Stiga robot at home and he defeated his mentor Gray to win a national championship in Ohio and also won another title along with Gray in the doubles to win against Jelenevsky and Ty Kaus.\nIn 1973, Dempsey was ranked no.1 among the young adult players of Ohio and ranked no. 6 in the male Ohio table tennis players category. He went to the World Championships in Stoke Mandeville, England where Michael won 1st of his seven World's singles titles, this was also where he had beaten Sam Hagai for the first time after his defeat in the 1972 Summer Paralympics Games in Heidelberg, he also won the doubles title with Gray. \nMichael graduated in 1974 in Gahanna Lincoln High School, he awarded a Varsity sport jacket for \"his achievements in table tennis and basketball\" and was inducted into the National Honor Society for \"his scholarship, character, leadership and service\". In March 1974, Michael went to Mount Airy Lodge in Pennsylvania to visit a training center so that he could be coached to compete against top 15 or above able-bodied juniors in the United States and he was hoping to join the US junior team that will play against Germany in a tournament. From 1975 to 1977, Dempsey and his teammate Fletcher went on to win a doubles title together in 1975. After 1977, Dempsey won six singles consecutively from 1977 to 1982 in not just his class but in open categories.\nIn the early 1980s, Dempsey didn't win any singles or doubles titles in both Worlds' and Pan-Am Championships however he did win two golds and a bronze medal in 1985 in Vienna.\nWinning major titles.\nMichael Dempsey won his first medals in the World Para Table Tennis Championships in Assen, Netherlands: he won a silver medal in the singles by Thomas Kreidel and won a bronze medal in the teams' event by France who went on to win the title.\nDuring the 1990s, Dempsey won the most medals of his career in one event: three golds in the Para PanAmerican Games in Mexico. He won these medals in the singles, open singles and teams event along with Andre Scott.\nParalympics success.\nDempsey first competed in the 1972 Summer Paralympics in Heidelberg, West Germany at a young age of 16 where he was the youngest in the table tennis team. He won his first Paralympic medals: silver in singles match (Sam Hagai of Israel won the gold medal) and a bronze medal in the doubles along with Sam Fletcher. After his successful first competition at the Heidelberg Games, he was congratulated by the Ohio House of Representatives. \nIn the 1976 Summer Paralympics in Toronto, Canada, Dempsey won his first gold medal after defeating West Germany alongside his teammate Gary Kerr. He won a silver medal in the singles by being defeated by Baruch Hagai from Israel.\nHis third Games, the 1980 Summer Paralympics in Arnhem, Netherlands, he won a gold medal in the men's singles 4 by defeating Grady Uyt de Boogaardt of the Netherlands. He also won a silver medal with Kaus and Kerr in the teams' event.\nDempsey performed poorly in the 1984 Summer Paralympics in Stoke Mandeville after winning a bronze medal in the singles event while the teams' event didn't win any medals. However, in 1988, he defeated Guy Tisserant to win the gold medal in the open singles and a bronze medal in the singles category 4 event.\nPersonal life.\nMichael met Shannon Kirk in 1978 while she worked in a bank: she worked alongside him while he was in a working partnership with Küschall, they both married on August 3, 1991. They travelled frequently around the world to places such as Hawaii, New Zealand and Australia. In December 2003, they adopted their infant son Henry from Kazakhstan.\nHe was inducted into three halls of fame for sporting career: Ohio Wheelchair Athletic Association in 1981, the California Table Tennis Hall of Fame in 2001 and US Table Tennis Hall of Fame one year later. Dempsey was also a long time member of the San Diego Table Tennis Association.\nDeath.\nOn April 29, Michael flew to Ohio to attend a board meeting in Greif Inc., after his meeting, Dempsey was in the middle of laughing with others but in the middle of this laugh, Dempsey suffered from a large brain aneurism and was rushed to Riverside Methodist Hospital in San Diego, California where he was later pronounced dead shortly afterwards."

        "title": "1980–81 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1980–81 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in college ice hockey. In its fourteenth year under head coach Bob Johnson, the team compiled a 27–14–1 record (17–11 against Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) opponents) and outscored all opponents 218 to 155. The Badgers were the recipients of an at-large bid in the first year that the NCAA guaranteed 8 teams entry into the postseason tournament and in doing so became the first team to win a national championship because of the expanded format.\nSeason.\nWisconsin began the 1980–81 season fresh after compiling its first losing season since returning to NCAA play in 1963. With little expectation for the '81 campaign Bob Johnson's Badgers got off to a fast start, going 7-1 in the first month of the season before embarking on a .500 skid in early November. The Badgers would lose a game in every weekend series until after Christmas when they finally managed to take both games against a mediocre Yale squad, only to lose both games to Rensselaer the following week. Wisconsin was hampered by high-scoring freshman and future NHL-er Bruce Eakin leaving the program after only four games and heading to the WHL.\nFrom January 1 onward, Wisconsin managed to just post a winning record, going 10-8 over that stretch but still finishing in a tie for second in conference standings on the strength of their early-season success. The Badgers won the tie-breaker over Michigan Tech and were seeded second in the WCHA Tournament. After winning their first game against Colorado College 8-2 it appeared Wisconsin was set for an appearance in second round until the Tigers roared back with an 11-4 win in the second game and upset a stunned Badger team 13-12 in the series.\nOrdinarily that would have been the end of the Wisconsin's season but in the summer of 1980 the NCAA changed its tournament format. With the success of the CCHA and the increasing number of programs at the Division I level the NCAA tournament was expanded to 8 teams, 4 for eastern schools and 4 for western squads. As tournament co-champions Minnesota and Michigan Tech received automatic bids, as did CCHA champion Northern Michigan. That left one spot open for a western school. Due to the feeling at the time that the CCHA was a 'lesser' conference the 24-12-3 record of second place Ohio State was seen as inferior to anything the WCHA could offer and the Buckeyes were passed over. While the Badgers did lose in the first round Denver, who had finished only two points behind Wisconsin, had also lost their first round matchup and the team that had defeated them, Michigan, were soundly beaten by Michigan Tech in the Second round 9-2. With no team standing out from the rest the tournament committee settled on awarding the final spot to Wisconsin.\nWisconsin opened the 1981 Tournament in front a hostile crowd in Potsdam, NY as they faced the top eastern seed Clarkson. Miraculously the Badgers managed to take the first game 3-2 but, just as the WCHA tournament had been, the NCAA first round was a 2-game total-goal series and 1 score was a very slim margin to hold. The second game was a much more explosive affair with both teams notching six goals in regulation play. Because of a peculiarity with the series Wisconsin leading 9-8 after regulation didn't end the matchup and the two would play one overtime session to see if the 'winner' of the game could be determined. If Wisconsin scored the series would be over immediately, however, if Clarkson scored the game would continue because the series had been tied at 9-9 despite an overtime marker. Neither of those events came to pass and both teams failed to score in the overtime session, allowing the game to finish in a tie and the Badgers to progress to the Frozen Four.\nIn their first game at the Duluth Arena the Badgers faced Northern Michigan, the first time the two teams played one another. Both squads played a scoreless first period before Ed Lebler opened the scoring three minutes into the second. Two more Badgers scored before the Wildcats could get their first goal of the game but Marc Behrend made sure that was all they could earn, turning away their 25 other shots en route to a 5-1 win. In the final Wisconsin was set against #1 overall seed Minnesota who possessed the top offense in the nation boasting both the NCAA scoring champion Aaron Broten and the first Hobey Baker Award winner Neal Broten. The Golden Gophers had taken three out of four contests against the Badgers that season, out-pacing Johnson's team 27 goals to 14. None of that seemed to affect Wisconsin in the slightest as it was the Badgers who opened the scoring half way through the first period and never looked back. Wisconsin got the game's first four goals and by the time Minnesota had found the back of the net it was too late. The 'Back Door' Badgers fired 42 shots on goal, not letting up even with a 5-1 lead after two periods. Marc Behrend turned aside 30 of 33 shots in the contest and finished the tournament with a .932 save percentage in the Frozen Four, earning Tournament MOP honors. Despite the spectacular Frozen Four John Newbery was the only Badger other than Behrend to make the All-Tournament Team but the Wisconsin faithful were too overjoyed from the unexpected championship to mind.\nNo Wisconsin player was named as an AHCA All-American and only Theran Welsh was named to the Second Team All-WCHA.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season, Wisconsin compiled a 27–14–1 record. Its schedule was as follows.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "South of Ireland Open Tennis Championship",
        "text": "The South of Ireland Open Tennis Championship originally called the South of Ireland Championships first established in 1876 and also known as the Limerick Cup is a grass court tennis tournament that features both men's and women's competitions that is currently an official tour event of Tennis Ireland. It is held at the Limerick Lawn Tennis Club in Limerick, County Limerick, Ireland. The championships is the world's second oldest surviving tennis tournament after Wimbledon but the only event to have been staged continuously for the last 141 years.\nHistory.\nA South of Ireland Championships tournament was staged in 1876, and played at the Limerick County Cricket Club, in Limerick. Records appear contradictory; the staging of this initial tournament appears to predate the founding of the Limerick LTC in 1877 by one year.\nLimerick Lawn Tennis Club was first established in 1877 in Limerick, County Limerick, Ireland. The same year the club staged the first Open Championships in Ireland in August 1877 one month after the Wimbledon Championships were inaugurated, the results of that tournament were however not recorded. It was not until 1879 that the first Irish Lawn Tennis Championships were staged at the Fitzwilliam Tennis Club in Dublin. In 1877 a subsidiary tournament that played as part of the South of Ireland Championships was established called the Limerick Cricket Club Lawn Tennis Tournament or Limerick CC Lawn Tennis Tournament.\nIn 1878 the first \"South of Ireland Championships\" also known as the \"Limerick Cup\" were founded the men's event was won by Veere St Leger Goold. The event featured both men's and women's singles and doubles competitions and was the first notable tournament in Great Britain and Ireland to feature a woman's competition seven years before the Wimbledon Championships followed suit. In 1881 the reigning Wimbledon Champion William Renshaw and his twin brother Ernest Renshaw entered the doubles competition. Between 1884 and 1885 no women's event were staged. The 1885 and 1886 editions were won by future Wimbledon Champion Willoughby Hamilton.\nBetween 1911 and 1912 the championships were won by Irishman Frank Cosbie. With the advent of World War One the championships were still held from 1914 and 1919. Post war the championships were won again by Irish Lawn Tennis Championships finalist Frank Cosbie three times consecutively 1924 to 1926. The tournament was still staged during World War Two from 1939 to 1945. Post war the 1953 championships were won by American player Ellis Williamson. In 1975 the men's championships were won Michael. P. Hickey who played in 21 Davis Cup competitions as part of the Irish Team. British player Ross Matheson won the event in 1991, 1994 and 1996. Into the 2000s Brian McCarthy was probably the most successful player he won the championships in (2010,2014) and reached the finals on four occasions (2010–11, 2013–16).\nThe tournament was part of the pre-open era men's tennis tour from 1878 to 1967. Into the Open Era it did not survive as a tour tournament on the lucrative Grand Prix tennis circuit but did remain a fixture on the International Tennis Federation circuit for a short while until the mid-1990s. The tournament was downgraded again to regional status and continues to operate within the annual tennis tournament circuit of Tennis Ireland. The championships were staged in June 2018 which was the 141st edition of this tournament it was won by James Halas.\nFinals.\nNotes: Challenge Round: The Final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match. The challenge round was used in the early history of tennis (from 1877 through 1921) in some tournaments not all.\nMen's singles.\nIncomplete list of past winners and results included:\nOther tournaments.\nLimerick CC Tournament.\nThe Limerick Cricket Club Lawn Tennis Tournament was founded in 1877 and was played along with the South of Ireland Championships until 1883\nVenue.\nThe Limerick Lawn Tennis Club currently operates 12 artificial (synthetic) grass turf outdoor tennis courts and 3 squash courts."

        "title": "1976–77 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 1976–77 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey team represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in college ice hockey. In its tenth year under head coach Bob Johnson, the team compiled a 37–7–1 record (26–5–1 against Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) opponents) and outscored all opponents 264 to 161. The Badgers received the WCHA's automatic bid to the 1977 NCAA Division I Men's Ice Hockey Tournament by winning the 1977 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament, the only singular WCHA tournament champion over a 16-year period (1965 to 1981). They defeated the New Hampshire Wildcats in the Frozen Four semifinals and then beat WCHA- and Big Ten-rival Michigan Wolverines by a 6–5 score in overtime to win the national championship in Detroit, Michigan.\nGoalie Julian Baretta was chosen as the Most Outstanding Player in the NCAA Tournament. He had two shutouts and a .905 save percentage for the season. The team's leading scorer was junior defenseman Craig Norwich with 18 goals, 65 assists, and 83 points. Norwich was the third defenseman (Bob Heathcott, 1952; Dan Lodboa, 1970) in NCAA history to lead his team in scoring while winning a National Title in the same season (the next occurrence was 2018).\nSeason.\nHead coach Bob Johnson returned to the program after taking a year off to coach the Team USA at the 1976 Winter Olympics in Innsbruck. The Olympic team finished a disappointing 5th-place after taking Silver in 1972 but the Badgers had fared even worse in Johnson's absence. Wisconsin went 12–24–1 under interim coach Bill Rothwell, compiling their first losing season since returning to varsity status in 1963 (The Badgers would not have another losing season until 1995–96).\nSeeking to erase the previous year from their collective memories, the Badgers opened with a 6–7 overtime loss to dual conference rival Michigan but evened their record with an overtime win the following day. Over the next six games, Wisconsin scored no less than 5 times, winning each match until Michigan State handed them their second defeat of the season. After trading wins with several teams, and losing a match to HC Spartak Moscow, Wisconsin won 12 games in a row after the new year, rocketing up the standings to take first place in the WCHA. Wisconsin finished the regular season winning 26 of their 32 WCHA games to capture their first conference title and were led by Craig Norwich in scoring. Norwich's 63 points in WCHA play was good for third best across the conference and paced all defensemen by a wide margin.\nPrior to the season, the NCAA instituted a new policy where they gave their tournament selection committee the ability to add up to four additional teams to the tournament. In response to this the WCHA changed their tournament format to have a solitary champion that would receive an automatic tournament bid rather than two co-champions who would both proceed to the national championship. This format would be in place for only the 1977 season and would revert to a co-champion system in 1978. Because of this Wisconsin would have to face three rounds of competitors rather than the customary two to win the WCHA tournament.\nThe Badgers played 8th-place Colorado College in the quarterfinals, who made the tournament over Michigan State based on tie-breakers. Though the Tigers had lost all four games to Wisconsin in the regular season they had done so with only seven fewer goals than the Badgers. In the two-game series Colorado College held Wisconsin's high-powered offense to only three goals twice, far below their average, but could only manage one score in each contest. In the semifinals the Badgers faced off against an upstart Minnesota squad that had defeated #2 seed Notre Dame in the opening round. The Golden Gophers were no match for the Badgers who took the series 17–8 and were set against Michigan in the championship series. Wisconsin got off to a great start, taking the first game 4–0, before cruising to a WCHA championship with a 5–4 win in the following game to take the series 9–4. The title gave Wisconsin an automatic bid to the 1977 NCAA tournament as the #1 western seed.\nIn their first game at the Olympia Stadium Wisconsin played New Hampshire, who possessed the #1 offense in the east. The two teams fought to a 3–3 tie after regulation but Julian Baretta kept everything out of the Badger's net in the extra frame and allowed Mike Eaves to score the game-winner. The championship match set Johnson's Badgers against Farrell's Wolverines for the seventh time that season. Wisconsin's offensive firepower was apparent from the start and the Badgers jumped out to a 3–0 lead on the strength of two power play goals. Michigan replied with two man-advantage markers of their own to cut the score to 3–2 but goals by Mike Meeker and Mark Johnson at the beginnings of the second and third periods rebuilt the Badger's 3-goal lead. The Wolverines, however, would not go away and Mark Miller scored 26 seconds after Johnson's second goal of the game. Dave Debol notched his second less than a minute later to cut Wisconsin's lead to 1 goal and it was completely erased with less than 6 minutes in regulation by John Wayman. With the score tied and the Badger's reeling Baretta kept the score tied 5–5 and allowed Wisconsin to regain their footing as the two teams headed into overtime. In what turned out to be the shortest overtime period in NCAA championship history, Steve Alley backhanded the puck past Michigan netminder Rick Palmer and sent the Badger faithful into paroxysms of joy.\nWisconsin won its second National Title in 5 years on the strength of its power play, scoring a then-record 93 goals on the man-advantage over the course of the season. Only the 1980 Minnesota team has scored more (99). Mark Johnson set an NCAA record for freshman in assists (44) and points (80) and was named WCHA Freshman of the Year. Bob Johnson was named as the WCHA Coach of the Year while Julian Baretta and Craig Norwich earned both First Team All-WCHA and AHCA All-American honors. Mike Eaves was selected for the WCHA Second Team and an All-American while John Taft received a spot on the WCHA Second Team.\nStandings.\nSchedule.\nDuring the season, Wisconsin compiled a 37–7–1 record, the best year the program has ever produced. Its schedule was as follows.\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;"

        "title": "2019 United States FIBA Basketball World Cup team",
        "text": "The United States men's national basketball team competed in the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup and finished in seventh place. After winning the past two World Cups in 2010 and 2014, they were seeking to become the first country to capture three straight gold medals. With high-profile players electing not to participate, Team USA was devoid of A-list players from the National Basketball Association (NBA). They were also impacted throughout by injuries to players Jayson Tatum and Marcus Smart. The Americans lost to France in the quarterfinals, ending their 58-game winning streak in FIBA (International Basketball Federation) and Olympic competition. Normally played every four years, the tournament was moved from its expected 2018 playing to avoid conflicting with soccer's World Cup schedule.\nAfter rule changes by FIBA in 2015, the US no longer automatically qualified for the World Cup despite winning the Olympics in 2016. Changes in timing also resulted in the qualifying rounds overlapping with the NBA's season. Consequently, USA Basketball decided to deploy squads of players mostly from the NBA G League, the NBA's development league. Coached by Jeff Van Gundy, they qualified the US for the World Cup, where the Americans switched to a team of NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich. They finished the World Cup as one of the top two countries in the Americas, directly qualifying them for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.\nBackground.\nIn 2015, FIBA changed the World Cup qualification process into a two-round tournament of home-and-away round robins over 16 months, which was similar to FIFA World Cup's process for soccer. Olympic gold no longer resulted in an automatic World Cup bid. The US was in the Americas group of 16 teams battling for 12 spots in the second round of the qualifying stage and finally for seven World Cup berths. To be eligible for the World Cup, the US first had to participate in the 2017 FIBA AmeriCup. The United States had not played in the FIBA Americas tournament since 2007; they had been exempt from qualifying, having won every prior Olympics and world championships.\nPlayers for the qualifying squads were chosen by a USA Basketball qualification committee. Their teams were made up of players primarily from the NBA G League, since FIBA had changed the World Cup qualifiers from summer to year-round, most of which conflicted with the seasons of top professional leagues such as the NBA and the EuroLeague. Unlike in soccer, there is no culture for leagues to schedule in-season breaks for players to compete for their national team. The coach for the qualifiers was Jeff Van Gundy, who is a basketball analyst for ESPN/ABC and a former NBA head coach who coached in the NBA Finals. He made his national team coaching debut in the 2017 Americup. Van Gundy and his squads were tasked with qualifying the US for the World Cup, when the U.S. would switch to a team of NBA players coached by Gregg Popovich. The five-time NBA champion Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs took over the national team from Mike Krzyzewski, who won three Olympic gold medals and two World Cups for the US.\nQualification.\nPlaying games in North and South America, the US qualified for the World Cup after going 10–2. They relied on an assortment G League players and free agents, using a total of 54 different players in the 12 games.\nFirst round.\nIn the first round of qualification, games were played in three windows in November 2017 along with February and June 2018. The November team included four players from the US squad that went 5–0 to win the AmeriCup. Only two players—forward Travis Wear and guard Larry Drew II—returned for Team USA in their second qualifying window. The final window was also the first that was not during the NBA season. While some NBA players joined their national teams, the US continued playing with G League players. Trey McKinney-Jones and Marcus Thornton joined the Americans after needing to withdraw in February on account of 10-day contracts they had signed with NBA teams. On June 28, 2018, the US lost 78–70 to Mexico. It was the Americans first loss under Van Gundy and just the second defeat in 30 games against Mexico. It was also Team USA's first loss at the national-team level since 2006. The Mexico squad had just four players from its November team that lost by 36 points to the US They added players from various professional leagues who were unavailable earlier, including former NBA player Gustavo Ayón, who was coming off a EuroLeague championship with Real Madrid. The Americans advanced after finishing the round 5–1.\nSecond round.\nIn the first window of the second round, the US roster had a larger presence of players with NBA experience, though they were still mainly G League players. The June–July window in the first round conflicted with the NBA free agency period and NBA Summer League, while its first two windows were during the NBA season. For the second window, the United States again relied exclusively on G-Leaguers, using nine current players and three free agents with previous NBA experience. Nine of the 12 players had not played in the eight earlier qualifiers. The US qualified for the World Cup after rallying with a late 12–0 run against Uruguay to win 78–70.\nWorld Cup roster.\nAn initial pool of 35 players was named in April 2018 as candidates for the United States' 12-man roster. The list included 11 members from their 2016 Olympic gold-medal team, and five players who had won nine of the previous 10 NBA Most Valuable Player Awards. The US held its first minicamp in July 2018, which 23 of the 35 players attended. In the past, USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo had mandated that players attended camps or risk disqualification; however, rules were relaxed in recent years.\nIn June 2019, a group of 20 players were initially invited to training camp to be held in Las Vegas in early August. A number of players withdrew leading up to camp, but replacements were named, leaving 15 candidates to vie for 12 spots on the World Cup roster. Only four of the remaining players had been NBA All-Stars: Brook Lopez, Kyle Lowry, Khris Middleton, and Kemba Walker. Of the 11 Americans who were among the 15 All-NBA selections in 2018–19, only third-team member Walker remained. Lowry withdrew after his thumb had not recovered from surgery a month earlier to repair a torn tendon he suffered in the 2019 NBA playoffs during the Toronto Raptors' championship run.\nHarrison Barnes was the only player with Olympic experience (2016) on the final US roster. It had become customary for the Americans' World Cup teams to have few former Olympians. Barnes and Mason Plumlee (2014 World Cup) were the only former senior-level national team players. While Team USA typically drew fewer star players for the World Cup than the Olympics, the turnout was low even by World Cup standards. Only four members from the original 35-player pool were left on the final roster. A factor cited by Colangelo was FIBA moving the World Cup and the Olympics to back-to-back years, and its conflicts with the NBA schedule. Six NBA teams had preseason games scheduled overseas in 2019–20.\nThe US team was left with only two players, Middleton and Walker, who were All-Stars in the prior season. Measured either by All-Star or All-NBA selections, the remaining roster ranked among the least accomplished of any US Olympic or World Cup roster made up of NBA players since they were first allowed in 1992. Excluded was the 1998 World Championship team, which did not include NBA players due to the 1998–99 NBA lockout; they used a mix of non-NBA pro players and college players and finished with the bronze medal. The 2019 squad's two All-Stars from the prior season tied the low set by the 2004 Olympic team, which infamously did not win gold, for the fewest players coming off an All-Star season leading up to an international competition. The five career All-Star appearances of Lopez, Middleton, and Walker was the lowest ever, roughly half the total of past World Cup squads. Their All-NBA total also ranked the lowest.\nWalker, who had recently signed with the Boston Celtics as a free agent, was joined on the US team by Celtics teammates Jaylen Brown, Jayson Tatum, and Marcus Smart. It was the first time Team USA had four teammates from the same NBA team.\nThe following were candidates to make the team: \nExhibition games.\nTeam USA was 3–1 in exhibition games. They split two games against Australia, losing the second game 98–94. The loss ended a 78-game winning streak in major international tournaments and exhibitions with an NBA roster, which dated back to the 2006 FIBA World Championship team.\nGroup phase.\nFirst round.\nCzech Republic.\nDonovan Mitchell scored a team-high 16 points and led all Americans with 25 minutes played as the US won 88–67 over the Czech Republic. The Czechs took an early 11–7 lead, but the US pretty much cruised the rest of the way. NBA player Tomáš Satoranský scored a game-high 17 points and added five assists for the Czech Republic, whose game plan was to have their point guard use his advantage over Walker. However, Walker held his own on defense and had 13 points along with four assists. Barnes was the second-leading scorer for Team USA with 14 points.\nTurkey.\nMiddleton made two free throws with 2.1 seconds remaining in overtime to put the US ahead 93–92, and they hung on to win after Turkey's Ersan Ilyasova missed a 3-pointer as time expired. The Turks were ahead 92–91 with under 20 seconds remaining, but Cedi Osman and Doğuş Balbay missed four straight free throws to keep the Americans in the game. Tatum had forced overtime by making two of his three free throws after he was fouled shooting a 3-pointer with 0.1 seconds left in regulation.\nThe US led 10–2 early, and were never behind in the first half. They led 26–21 after one quarter, and were up 41–26 with 5:33 remaining in the half. However, US-born Scottie Wilbekin, who was naturalized in Turkey a year before, led a 12–0 run, and the contest remained close for the rest of the game. Ranked No. 17 in the world, Turkey figured to be the US team's toughest competition in the first round. Their lineup featured NBA players Ilyasova, Osman, Furkan Korkmaz and Semih Erden. Ilyasova had a game-high 23 points and 14 rebounds in 38 minutes. The Turks played most of the game using a 2–3 zone defense, which stalled Team USA's offense. The Americans made 14-of-40 from 3-point range and just 13-of-37 on 2-pointers.\nTatum sprained his left ankle while making the pass to a driving Middleton which led to the game-winning free throws. Initially ruled out for at least the next two games, he missed the remainder of the World Cup.\nJapan.\nThe US raced out to an 11–0 lead en route to a 53-point win over Japan, 98–45. Brown had 20 points and seven rebounds, and Walker scored 15 and Barnes added 14 in the Americans' best offensive performance to date. Team USA held Rui Hachimura, Japan's top player and the No. 9 overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, to four points on two-of-eight shooting. Yudai Baba led the Japanese with 18 points and was their only player to score in double figures.\nIn addition to missing Tatum, the US played without Smart, who was suffering a left quad strain. Smart had missed most of training camp with a calf strain, also on his left side. The Americans had already qualified for the next round, which lowered the stakes for the game.\nSecond round.\nGreece.\nWalker scored a team-high 15 points and had six assists in a 69–53 win over Greece. The NBA's reigning most valuable player, Giannis Antetokounmpo, had 15 points and 13 rebounds for the Greeks, but his plus-minus was -17 when he was in the game. Coach Popovich went to a small lineup at times, enabling the United States to switch effectively on pick and rolls by Antetokounmpo. American center Lopez did not play at all in the game. Antetokounmpo and his brother, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, had to be separated from the US team after a hard foul by Thanasis late in the game left Barnes on his stomach.\nBrazil.\nWalker and Myles Turner each scored 16 points in a 89–73 win over Brazil. The US advanced to the quarterfinals, and also clinched a berth in the 2020 Summer Olympics as one of the top two finishing teams from the Americas (along with Argentina).\nFinal round.\nFrance.\nFrance came back from a seven-point fourth quarter deficit to win 89–79 over the US, ending the Americans' 58-game winning streak in FIBA and Olympic competition. Evan Fournier scored 22 points and reigning back-to-back NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award winner Rudy Gobert had 21 points and 16 rebounds for the French. Mitchell had 29 points for Team USA, but he was held scoreless in the final period. The loss dropped the US into the fifth-place bracket.\nIn the third quarter, Team USA was faced with its first 10-point deficit of the tournament, when Popovich went to a small lineup. The United States went on a 20–9 run to lead 66–63 entering the final period. However, the French outscored the Americans 20–5 over the final 6:59. The US missed seven of their 11 free throws in the quarter and committed three turnovers in the final 3:07.\nSerbia.\nBogdan Bogdanović scored 28 points to lead Serbia to a 94–89 win over the United States, who were assured of their worst major tournament finish ever, surpassing their sixth-place showing in the 2002 World Championship. The Serbs outscored the Americans 32–7 in the first quarter for a 25-point lead, but the US held a 33–12 advantage in the second period to trail 44–40 at the half. Entering the tournament, the US and Serbia were considered the favorites to meet for the gold medal. Smart missed the game due to an injured left hand.\nPoland.\nThe United States won 87–74 over Poland to finish the World Cup in seventh place. The Americans received strong performances from Mitchell (16 points and 10 assists) and Joe Harris (14 points). The US was up 17 points at halftime, but Poland kept the match close for much of the second half. Team USA played again without the injured Smart, and Walker missed the game as well with a neck injury."

        "title": "2018 World Series",
        "text": "The 2018 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's 2018 season. The 114th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox and the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The Red Sox defeated the Dodgers in five games to win their fourth World Series title in 15 years dating back to , and their ninth in franchise history. This was the second World Series matchup between the two franchises, after the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins (later known as the Dodgers) in five games in . The series was sponsored by the Internet television service YouTube TV and officially known as the \"2018 World Series presented by YouTube TV\".\nThe Series was televised in the United States on Fox. Steve Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, while Alex Cora became the fifth first-season manager and first manager from Puerto Rico to win the World Series. The Series was notable for its third game which lasted 18 innings, a World Series record.\nThe 2018 World Series was the first since to feature two teams which had also reached the postseason in the prior year. Additionally, the Red Sox became the first team to win two World Series exactly one century apart, as they had defeated the Chicago Cubs in 1918, while the Dodgers were the first team since the 2011 Texas Rangers, and the first NL team since the 1992 Atlanta Braves, to lose consecutive World Series.\nBackground.\nThe Boston Red Sox' most recent World Series appearance was their 2013 win over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Los Angeles Dodgers, who last won a World Series in 1988 over the Oakland Athletics, made their second consecutive appearance, after losing to the Houston Astros in 2017. The two franchises faced each other in the 1916 World Series; the Red Sox won the series in five games against the then-Brooklyn Robins.\nRed Sox manager Alex Cora and Dodgers manager Dave Roberts were teammates on the Dodgers in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Although they did not play together on the Red Sox, both managers played and won a World Series championship with Boston—Roberts in 2004 and Cora in 2007. This was the first World Series with two managers of color; additionally, both managers were born outside the contiguous United States, as Cora was born in Puerto Rico and Roberts in Japan.\nWhile this was a rare match-up, with the Dodgers-Red Sox having only met 20 times ever, the Dodgers trade deadline acquisition Manny Machado had a long history with the Red Sox. In a game in April 2017, Machado, then with the Baltimore Orioles, aggressively slid over the second base bag and spiked Dustin Pedroia in the knee. Pedroia missed 56 of the remaining 145 games, twice going on the injured list. The Red Sox responded by throwing at Machado throughout the 2017 season, feeling that the slide was a dirty play. Setbacks to his recovery left Pedroia out of the lineup for all but 11 at-bats during the 2018 season. Before the World Series, Pedroia told WEEI’s Rob Bradford about the slide. “I think about it all the time.” And when Bradford asked if there’s been any contact with Machado since then, Pedroia had a terse response, “no.” In the 2018 World Series, Machado was booed heavily at Fenway Park. By the time of his retirement in 2021, Pedroia said he had forgiven Machado and he was \"at peace with the play.\"\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe Red Sox finished with a record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees, and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason. The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116. The 2018 Red Sox were highlighted by All-Stars Mookie Betts, Craig Kimbrel, J. D. Martinez, and Chris Sale. Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in. Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts. Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters in 62.1 innings.\nThe Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series. Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series. Including their 2004 win that ended the Curse of the Bambino, this was the fourth World Series appearance by the Red Sox in 15 years and their 13th appearance all-time.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nDespite a start to the season and nine losses in an 11-game stretch in mid-August, the Dodgers made the playoffs for the sixth straight year by winning the division in a one-game tiebreaker over the Rockies. At the July trade deadline, the team traded for All-Star shortstop Manny Machado from the Orioles to replace injured shortstop Corey Seager and a former All-Star second baseman Brian Dozier from the Twins. In August, the Dodgers acquired former World Series MVP David Freese from the Pirates. For the second year in a row, the Dodgers broke their franchise record for most team home runs in a season. With a record, the team entered the playoffs as a second seed and went on to beat the Atlanta Braves in four games in the 2018 National League Division Series and the Milwaukee Brewers in seven games in the 2018 National League Championship Series, becoming the first team in either league to win Game 7 of a League Championship Series on the road since the 2006 Cardinals.\nThe 2018 Dodgers were the first team to make the World Series by winning their tie-breaker game since the 2007 Colorado Rockies, who also faced and lost to Boston in that World Series. This was the Dodgers' fifth back-to-back World Series appearance (Two came in Brooklyn in 1952–1953 and 1955–1956, and two came in Los Angeles in 1965–1966 and 1977–1978), and the first time since the 2014-15 Kansas City Royals to win back-to-back League Championship Series. Overall, this was the Dodgers' 20th World Series appearance.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe Red Sox started Chris Sale against the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw. Kershaw became the first pitcher to start the first game of the World Series in back-to-back years since Cliff Lee did so in 2009 (for the Phillies) and 2010 (for the Rangers) and the first to do so for the same team since Dave Stewart pitched three consecutive Game 1s for the Oakland Athletics from 1988 to 1990. The Red Sox struck in the first inning when Mookie Betts singled, stole second and then scored on a hit by Andrew Benintendi, who subsequently scored on a single by J. D. Martinez. Boston benefited from Dodgers' first baseman David Freese missing a foul pop-up by Betts, and right fielder Yasiel Puig allowing Benintendi to advance to second base on a late throw to the plate. A homer by Matt Kemp in the second inning gave the Dodgers a run, and an RBI single by Manny Machado in the third inning tied the score, 2–2. In the bottom of the third, Steve Pearce grounded into a fielder's choice—which was called an inning-ending double play on the field, but overturned by video review—and the Red Sox regained the lead on an RBI double by Martinez in the following at-bat. In the top of the fifth, a groundout by Machado plated Brian Dozier to even the score, 3–3. \nSale wound up pitching into the fifth inning, allowing three runs on five hits and two walks with seven strikeouts. The Red Sox loaded the bases with no outs in the bottom of the fifth, and scored the go-ahead run when Xander Bogaerts grounded into a fielder's choice. A single by Rafael Devers off reliever Ryan Madson in the next at-bat made it 5–3. Kershaw's final line was five runs on seven hits and three walks with five strikeouts in four-plus innings. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the seventh off reliever Ryan Brasier and scored a run on a sacrifice fly by Machado. Eduardo Núñez hit a pinch-hit three-run home run off Alex Wood in the bottom of the seventh to make it a four-run lead for the Red Sox, 8–4, with no further scoring in the game. Boston reliever Matt Barnes, who finished the fifth inning after relieving Sale, got the win, while Kershaw took the loss for Los Angeles.\nGame 2.\nGame 2 featured another matchup of left-handed pitchers; Boston started David Price, who got the win in Game 5 of the 2018 American League Championship Series, while Los Angeles started Hyun-jin Ryu, who took the loss in Game 6 of the 2018 National League Championship Series. The Red Sox again scored first, this time in the second inning, when Xander Bogaerts doubled and then scored on a single by Ian Kinsler. The Dodgers loaded the bases in the fourth inning and David Freese scored on a sacrifice fly by Matt Kemp to tie the game; Yasiel Puig then singled to drive in Manny Machado with the go-ahead run. After the Red Sox loaded the bases against Ryu in the bottom of the fifth, reliever Ryan Madson walked in the tying run and J. D. Martinez drove in two more with a single. Ryu's final line was four runs allowed on six hits and one walk with five strikeouts in 4 innings. \nPrice only allowed two runs on three hits and three walks in six innings while striking out five. Both bullpens prevented more runs from scoring as the Red Sox won, 4–2, to take a two games to none lead. Ryu took the loss for the Dodgers, while Price earned the win for Boston with closer Craig Kimbrel getting his sixth save this postseason. It was also the 100th postseason victory in Red Sox franchise history.\nGame 3.\nAfter two games started by left-handed pitchers, both teams started right-handed pitchers for Game 3; Walker Buehler for the Dodgers and Rick Porcello for the Red Sox. With no designated hitter, J. D. Martinez started in left field for the Red Sox, in place of usual left fielder Andrew Benintendi. The Dodgers scored first, for the first time in the series, when Joc Pederson homered in the third inning. Porcello pitched 4 innings, allowing the one run on three hits and one walk while striking out five. Buehler pitched seven scoreless innings allowing only two hits with no walks and seven strikeouts. Jackie Bradley Jr. hit a home run off Kenley Jansen with two outs in the eighth inning to tie the game. It was Jansen's first blown save in four opportunities this postseason.\nNo one scored in the ninth after Cody Bellinger was caught between bases to end the ninth and the game went into extra innings tied at one. In the top of the 10th inning, pinch-runner Ian Kinsler attempted to score from third on Rafael Devers's sacrifice fly, but a strong throw by center fielder Bellinger saw Kinsler out at the plate. In the 13th inning, Brock Holt walked, advanced on a wild pitch, scored the go-ahead run on an infield single by Eduardo Núñez and a throwing error by pitcher Scott Alexander. Then, in the bottom of the inning, Max Muncy walked against Nathan Eovaldi, advanced to second on a pop out to Núñez in foul territory (Nuñez made a great catch and tumbled into the stands after making the catch, which allowed Muncy to advance) scoring the tying run after an infield hit by Yasiel Puig and a throwing error by Ian Kinsler. In the bottom of the 15th, Muncy appeared to hit a walk-off home run down the right-field line but the ball hooked foul. Muncy hit a walk-off home run off Eovaldi in the 18th inning to win it for the Dodgers, 3–2, to cut their series deficit to 2–1. Eovaldi had just begun his seventh inning of relief.\nAt 18 innings and seven hours and 20 minutes, this contest became the longest World Series game by both innings and time, surpassing (in playing time) Game 3 of the 2005 World Series, which lasted 14 innings and five hours and 41 minutes, and breaking the record (in innings) first set in Game 2 of the 1916 World Series, when the Red Sox and Dodgers (then known as the Robins) played 14 innings. \nMuncy tied the record for latest (18th inning) walk-off hit in postseason history, equalling Chris Burke in Game 4 of the 2005 National League Division Series. It was also the Dodgers' first game-winning World Series home run since Kirk Gibson in Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. The game took longer to play than the entire 1939 World Series, which had seven hours and five minutes of total playing time over four games. Until Game 1 of the 2020 World Series, this was the last time a team won a World Series game in their home ballpark.\nUntil Game 1 of the 2022 World Series, this is the last World Series game to go to extra innings.\nGame 4.\nFollowing the longest game in World Series history, the Dodgers started Rich Hill while Eduardo Rodríguez made his first start of the postseason for the Red Sox. At 38 years old, Hill was the oldest player to start a World Series game since 39-year-old Tim Hudson started two games for the San Francisco Giants in 2014 and the oldest for the Dodgers since Sal Maglie in 1956. As he had pitched in relief in Game 3, Rodríguez became just the sixth pitcher in history to start a World Series game with zero days rest, and the first since Firpo Marberry of the Washington Senators in the 1924 World Series. The Red Sox had intended to start Nathan Eovaldi, but he needed rest after throwing 97 pitches in relief in Game 3. With no designated hitter, the Red Sox started an outfield of Andrew Benintendi, Mookie Betts, and J. D. Martinez, with Jackie Bradley Jr. on the bench in place of Benintendi, who did not start the previous game.\nThe game was scoreless through the first five innings. In the bottom of the sixth, the Dodgers loaded the bases against Rodríguez and scored the game's first run on a throwing error by catcher Christian Vázquez. The next batter, Yasiel Puig, hit a three-run home run to extend the lead to 4–0. In a fit of rage, Rodríguez slammed his glove down on the mound in frustration and was later pulled after pitching 5 innings, allowing the four runs on four hits and two walks with six strikeouts. At that point, Red Sox ace Chris Sale made an angry speech that fired up his teammates in the dugout. In the top of the seventh, after striking out Eduardo Núñez with a runner on first, Hill was taken off the mound in favor of reliever Ryan Madson, a decision by Roberts which was criticized by several including then-current President Donald Trump. Mitch Moreland hit a three-run pinch-hit home run off of Madson to make it a one-run game. Hill was charged with one run in innings on one hit and three walks with seven strikeouts. Madson set a new World Series record by allowing seven inherited runners to score in the series. Steve Pearce hit a homer off Kenley Jansen in the eighth inning. This was the second straight day Jansen allowed a game-tying home run in that inning. \nJansen became just the second pitcher in World Series history to allow game-tying home runs in back-to-back games (Byung-hyun Kim for the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2001 was the other). In the top of the ninth, Brock Holt doubled off Dylan Floro and was driven in by a single by pinch hitter Rafael Devers to give Boston their first lead of the game. The Red Sox loaded the bases against Floro and Alex Wood and then Pearce doubled to right-center off Kenta Maeda, scoring all three base runners to put the Red Sox up, 8–4. They added another run when Xander Bogaerts drove in Pearce with a single. Kiké Hernández hit a two-run homer off of Craig Kimbrel in the ninth to cut the lead to three. Kimbrel was able to get the last three outs and the Red Sox took a three games to one lead.\nGame 5.\nOn October 28, Los Angeles became the first city to host an MLB, NFL (Rams), NBA (Clippers), NHL (Kings), and MLS (Galaxy) game all on the same day. Before the game, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird promoted the game, giving reminders that both Boston and Los Angeles were squaring off for a championship, though in the World Series for the first time; the Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers met in the NBA Finals 11 times since the Lakers moved from Minneapolis in 1960.\nClayton Kershaw started for the Dodgers, while David Price started for the Red Sox. Price became the first pitcher to start World Series games no more than four days apart while also pitching in relief between those games since Jack Billingham of the Cincinnati Reds did so in the 1972 World Series. Jackie Bradley Jr. again did not start in the outfield for Boston, but entered the game as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the ninth inning.\nBoth teams scored in the first inning. The Red Sox scored in the top of the inning after a one out single by Andrew Benintendi followed by a two-run home run by Steve Pearce. David Freese led off the bottom of the inning with a home run for the Dodgers. No one else scored until the sixth inning, when Mookie Betts hit a home run with one out and then J. D. Martinez hit a lead-off homer in the seventh to make it 4–1. Kershaw pitched seven innings, allowing four runs on seven hits, with five strikeouts and no walks. \nIn the eighth inning, Pearce hit another home run, this time off of Pedro Báez. Price pitched into the eighth, allowing only one run on three hits and two walks while striking out five. He became just the fifth pitcher to pitch 6+ innings and allow three or fewer hits in three straight postseason starts. Joe Kelly and Chris Sale pitched the last two innings and both struck out the side, Sale getting Manny Machado to strike out for the last out, the Red Sox winning the game 5–1 and the title 4–1. Pearce won the World Series Most Valuable Player Award.\nSeries statistics.\nBoston Red Sox.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nBatting.\n\"Note: GP=Games Played; AB=At Bats; R=Runs; H=Hits; 2B=Doubles; 3B=Triples; HR=Home Runs; RBI=Runs Batted In; BB=Walks; AVG=Batting Average; OBP=On Base Percentage; SLG=Slugging Percentage\"\nPitching.\n\"Note: G=Games Played; GS=Games Started; IP=Innings Pitched; H=Hits; BB=Walks; R=Runs; ER=Earned Runs; SO=Strikeouts; W=Wins; L=Losses; SV=Saves; ERA=Earned Run Average\"\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe World Series was televised nationally by Fox for the 19th straight year. Joe Buck was the play-by-play announcer, with John Smoltz as the color commentator. Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci were the field reporters. Fox Deportes offered a Spanish-language feed, with Rolando Nichols providing play-by-play and Carlos Álvarez and Edgar Gonzalez doing color commentary.\nOutside of the United States, MLB International carried the series with play-by-play by Matt Vasgersian and color commentary by Buck Martinez.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast all the World Series games in English for the 21st straight year as part of \"Major League Baseball on ESPN Radio\". Dan Shulman called the play-by-play, with Chris Singleton serving as color analyst and Buster Olney as field reporter. Marc Kestecher hosted the pre-game show with Olney and Tim Kurkjian reporting. Jon Sciambi called the play-by-play for Game 5 due to Shulman developing laryngitis.\nESPN Deportes Radio provided Spanish-language coverage of the Series. Eduardo Ortega called the play-by-play and Orlando Hernández, Renato Bermudez, and José Francisco Rivera served as analysts.\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers, which were simulcast over SiriusXM radio. In Los Angeles, the broadcast was on AM 570 LA Sports with Charley Steiner and Rick Monday in English, on Univision America 1020 with Jaime Jarrín and Jorge Jarrín in Spanish, and on Radio Korea 1540 AM in Korean. The Red Sox broadcast was on WEEI 93.7 FM in English with Joe Castiglione, Tim Neverett and Lou Merloni, and in Spanish on WCCM 1490 AM with Uri Berenguer.\nSponsorship.\nThe 2018 World Series was sponsored by YouTube TV, the second consecutive year that the service sponsored the series. This sponsorship included logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties, on the field, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games. As part of the agreement, YouTube TV would later sponsor the 2019 World Series.\nCelebration.\nOn the morning of October 31, the Red Sox celebration parade began at Fenway Park and made its way downtown to its final destination on Staniford Street. During the celebration, the World Series trophy sustained minor damage from a beer can thrown by a spectator; it was subsequently repaired.\nAn 80-minute documentary, \"2018 World Series: Damage Done\", which was produced by MLB and narrated by Uzo Aduba, was released on December 4.\nOn December 3, Red Sox president Sam Kennedy announced that team accepted an invitation to visit the White House. Originally planned for February 15, 2019, the visit was postponed to May 9, 2019, due to the 2018–19 United States federal government shutdown. Alex Cora announced that he would not attend, citing the administration's response to Hurricane Maria in his native Puerto Rico. On May 9, various team members along with owner John W. Henry and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski visited the White House and met with President Trump.\nAftermath.\nMiscellaneous.\nDuring the 2018–2019 off-season, the Dodgers signed former Red Sox reliever Joe Kelly to a three-year deal. Kelly was marvelous in the World Series against the Dodgers, having struck out ten batters and not allowing a run in five games pitched. Kelly, an Angels fan who disliked the Dodgers growing up in Corona, became a fan favorite with Dodger fans throughout his tenure with the team.\nFour months after the 2018 World Series, the Patriots won Super Bowl LIII, meaning the greater Boston area celebrated multiple championships for the 2018 MLB and NFL seasons. Greater Boston accomplished feat 14 years previously when the Red Sox won their first World Series in 86 years, while the Patriots won their third Super Bowl in four years. Like the ‘18 Red Sox, the Patriots beat a Los Angeles team (the Rams) in the Championship Game.\nAs of , this is the most recent World Series to have had no games played in Texas. The Houston Astros would win AL pennants in 2019, 2021 and 2022, while the Texas Rangers, who won the AL pennant in 2023, also hosted the 2020 World Series due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nBoston Red Sox.\nThe 2018 World Series would be the peak for the 2016–2018 Red Sox, who were the first Red Sox teams in franchise history to win the American League East for three straight seasons. President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski was fired on September 9, 2019, just 10 months after winning the 2018 World Series. On the field, Boston's top three starters in 2018 — Chris Sale, David Price, and Nathan Eovaldi — all missed significant time due to injury in 2019. Overall, the Red Sox would finish 19 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees in 2019. After the season, the team replaced Dombrowski with Tampa Bay Rays executive Chaim Bloom.\nThree significant events happened to the Red Sox before the start of the 2020 season that shaped the course of the team's future:\nThe Red Sox would finish the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season 24–36 (.400 winning percentage), which was their worst season since 1965. The team would rebound in 2021 and make it all the way to the ALCS before eventually losing to the Houston Astros in six games.\nDombrowski would later help lead the Phillies to a World Series appearance as lead executive in 2022. He was the first lead executive to make World Series appearances with four different teams, having done so with the Florida Marlins in 1997, Detroit Tigers in 2006 and 2012, and the Boston Red Sox in 2018.\nAs of 2024, Rafael Devers is the only current Red Sox player remaining from the 2018 team. In addition to Mookie Betts and Joe Kelly (Los Angeles Dodgers in ), Christian Vázquez (Houston Astros in ) and Nathan Eovaldi (Texas Rangers in ) also won a second World Series ring with different teams.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nCorey Seager returned to the Dodgers after being out for most of the 2018 season due to an elbow injury, while Manny Machado, who replaced him after the All-Star break, signed a record free agent contract with the San Diego Padres. The 2019 Dodgers broke the franchise record for wins at 106, but would experience October heartbreak once again by losing to eventual World Champion Washington Nationals in the NLDS in five games. The Dodgers became the second franchise to lose to the eventual World Series champions in four consecutive postseasons (the New York Yankees from 2001 to 2004 were the first).\nThe Dodgers traded for Mookie Betts during the 2019-2020 off-season and his addition made a great team even better. The Dodgers in 2020 would set the record for best winning percentage in franchise history (.717), win their 8th straight division title, and their first World Series in 32 years. The 2021 and 2022 teams were even better in the regular season, winning over 100 games each year, but both times the Dodgers fell short of the World Series.\nOver the years, 2018 Red Sox and Dodgers would eventually end up playing for the World Series opposition. Along with Kelly, Price, and Betts, Heath Hembree, Craig Kimbrel, J.D. Martinez, and Ryan Braiser joined the Dodgers in the subsequent years afterwards. On the other hand, Enrique Hernandez, Alex Verdugo, Kenley Jansen, and Justin Turner would later play for Boston. According to sportswriter John Tomase at NBC Sports Boston, up to 25% of the Boston Red Sox’s 2023 projected Opening Day roster were players with direct ties to the Dodgers. Incidentally, J.T. Watkins, the Red Sox video coordinator suspended for one year due to his role in the 2018 scandal, was hired by the Dodgers in 2022.\nWhile most of the Dodgers' core players in 2018 later played for the World Series-winning team in 2020, Brian Dozier won his own World Series ring with the Washington Nationals in ."

He was a national champion and won a silver medal at the 2013 World Rowing Championships.\nClub and state rowing.\nWebster's senior club rowing was from the Melbourne University Boat Club.\nUnusually for an Australian representative coxswain he made no state representative appearances at the annual Interstate Regattas in either youth or senior men's eights. In his prime representative years of 2013 and 2014 he was kept out of Victorian King's Cup crews by his older brother David Webster.\nInternational representative rowing.\nWebster made his Australian representative debut at the 2011 World Rowing U23 Championships in Amsterdam. He coxed the Australian men's U23 eight to an overall seventh-place finish. In 2012 he was again in the stern of the Australian men's U23 eight when they rowed to a bronze medal at the World Rowing U23 Championships in Trakai.\nIn 2013 Webster was elevated to the Australian senior squad when he coxed the men's lightweight eight to a silver medal at the 2013 World Rowing Championships in Chungju, Korea.\nThe 2014 World Rowing Cup I was in Sydney early in 2014. The final featured the Australian senior eight with a number of experienced Australian rowers and coxed by Timothy's older brother David, along with a second developmental eight coxed by Tim Webster. David also coxed at Melbourne Uni Boat Club, had earned a scholarship like Tim to the Victorian Institute of Sport, and was in the Australian senior squad from 2010 to 2015. The Australian senior eight won at that WRC I in 2014 and the crew steered by Tim Webster placed fourth.\nAt the 2014 World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam, Webster was up front in an Australian coxed pair which placed third in the B Final for an overall ninth-place finish. It was his last Australian representative appearance."

He and fellow American Curtis Carter, who signed with KR, have been credited for revolutionizing the Icelandic basketball scene after they became the first foreign born professional players in the Icelandic Basketball League in 1975.\nEarly life.\nRogers was born in Thompson, Texas and grew up in Houston with seven of his other siblings.\nIceland.\nIn September 1975, Rogers became the first foreign born professional basketball player in Iceland when he signed a three-month contract with Ármann in preparations for their games against Honka Playboys in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup.\nHis first games for Ármann where during the annual Reykjavík Basketball Tournament. Ármann finished second in the tournament, behind reigning national champions ÍR, and Rogers led all players in scoring with 113 points in five games for an average of 22.6 points per game.\nOn October 30, Rogers scored 24 points for Ármann in a disappointing 65-88 loss against the Honka Playboys in the first leg of the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup.\nThe first meeting between Rogers and Curtis Carter on December 16 was highly anticipated and did not disappoint. It was a tightly played and ended with an 86-81 victory for Ármann. But with 54 seconds remaining in the game, with the score tied at 81-81, Carter got into a fight with Rogers and knocked him down. The punch was caught on a picture and made the front page of Dagblaðið the day after, as well as the headline in Þjóðviljinn \"Jimmy won the duel - The Truck won the boxing\". Both players received a one-game suspension for the fight from the disciplinary court of the Icelandic Basketball Federation and where threatened with a six-game suspension for any future fights. The verdict was highly criticized, both for the short suspension and for the threat of a longer suspension that only applied to them, as referees were worried that opposing players would try to harass them and goad into a fight.\nIn the end, Rogers and Ármann came out on the top in the league after beating KR in the last game of the season, guaranteeing them the first place and the national championship. Rogers came second in the race for the scoring title, finishing with 365 points behind Carter's 451 points.\nOn April 1, 1976, Ármann won Njarðvík, 98-89, in the Icelandic Cup finals behind Rogers 32 points.\nRogers resigned with Ármann the following season, He was again the leading scorer during the Reykjavík Basketball Tournament with 135 points but Ármann again finished second in the standings, this time behind KR.\nHe was granted a leave of absence from the club in middle of December, with Ármann undefeated in first place, to return to the United States due to personal reasons. In January 1977, Ármann announced that he would not return from United States and continue his career."

Countries may also enter a “B” relay that will swim in a preceding heat. These “B” relays may not score points and are not eligible for medals. An NOC may enter up to 1 swimmer per sex (2 total), if they have no swimmers meeting any qualifying B standard."

It moved from October to March as the new Grand Prix tournament now took its old slot in the snooker calendar which was also played at the previous venue, the Hexagon Theatre in Reading. Guinness became the first of many sponsors for the next few years after British American Tobacco, under its trade name State Express, pulled out of all sport sponsorship in Great Britain. This new competition was now played at the new Bournemouth International Centre.\nEngland now played in two teams, with the defending champions competing as \"England A\" with the same players (Steve Davis, Tony Knowles and Tony Meo) while Jimmy White, Willie Thorne and John Spencer competed as \"England B\". The two Irish jurisdictions competed as \"All-Ireland\" and, for the first time since 1980, a \"Rest of the World\" team played with Silvino Francisco, Dene O'Kane and American pool player Jim Rempe (who also competed in 1980).

The association was later replaced in 1939 by the Chinese Sports Improvement Council, which was considered by the Basketball Association of Singapore to be the first instance of its organization.\nAfter the resolution of the World War II in 1946 which affected the promotion of basketball, Goh Chye Hin set up the Singapore Amateur Basketball Association (SABA). It's men's national team participated in the 1956 Summer Olympics.\nSABA became a member of FIBA Asia in 1961 and its men's team began participating in the ABC Championship (now FIBA Asia Cup). It renamed itself as the Basketball Association of Singapore (BAS) in 1967.\nNational team.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2019 SEA Games.\nPast roster.\nRoster for the 2017 SEABA Championship.\nDepth chart.\nRoster at the FIBA Asia Cup 2021 Pre-Qualifiers (Eastern Region)."

They were members of the Pac-12 Conference.\nThe Bruins started the season 3–5, their worst start since the 2014–15 season, before going on a 6-game winning streak. The Bruins then lost their next four, including a 72–67 home loss on January 20 to a USC team that had failed to win any of its first five conference games. The loss dropped the Bruins to 0–3 in Pac-12 home games on the season; in the previous \"three\" seasons, they had only lost one Pac-12 home game.\nThe Bruins' next game following the USC loss was an upset road win over No. 16 Arizona State.

UCLA's only two losses during that 12-game span were against No. 10 Stanford at home and No. 12 Oregon State on the road.\nOn March 6, 2019, Pac-12 media members voted head coach Cori Close Pac-12 Coach of the Year.\nThe Bruins secured a (4) seed and a first-round bye to the Pac-12 Tournament.

Karlović was himself upset later in the day by qualifier Simon Stadler, while thirty-second seed Michaël Llodra retired against Mario Ančić due to a left arm injury. Canadian wild card Frank Dancevic produced the biggest upset of the day knocking out former finalist David Nalbandian in straight sets, and in a mere ninety-six minutes.\nIn the women's singles, French Open champion and new World No. 1 Ana Ivanovic easily defeated her first round adversary, and was followed in the second round by Nicole Vaidišová, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Agnieszka Radwańska, Ágnes Szávay, Alona Bondarenko, Amélie Mauresmo and 2007 Wimbledon runner-up Marion Bartoli, as well as two-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams, who was tested against Roland-Garros quarterfinalist Kaia Kanepi, before winning the match on the score of 7–5, 6–3, and sixth seed Anna Chakvetadze, who won her first round encounter 2–6, 6–1, 8–6, saving all four match points her opponent Stéphanie Dubois held against her.

Former World No. 1 Marat Safin eliminated a third consecutive seed in the tournament, as he beat Rome Masters finalist Stan Wawrinka for the first time in three encounters, on the score of 6–4, 6–3, 5–7, 6–1, to match his best result in Wimbledon, a 2001 quarterfinal.

Kuznetsova and Janković's losses, together with the defeats of Ivanovic and Sharapova earlier in the tournament, meant that none of the top four seeds reached the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam for the first time in the Open Era.

Meanwhile, defending champion Jamie Murray &amp; partner Liezel Huber defeated second seeds Daniel Nestor &amp; Chuang Chia-jung in the first quarterfinals match of the event.\nDay 10.\nRain delayed play again, stopping all matches for a short time in the mid-afternoon, and once more for a longer period in the late afternoon. Play resumed at around 18:00 (UTC+1).\nThe men's last quarterfinal, stopped before the night on Day 9, resumed on the score of 6–3, 5–7, to see ATP No. 94 Rainer Schüttler win the third set's tie-break, ATP No. 145 Arnaud Clément win the fourth's after a rain delay, and the two former Australian Open runners-up battle through the fifth set, with Clement first holding a match point on the German's serve, Schüttler breaking but immediately being broken back, the rain stopping the play at 6–6, 40-all on the Frenchman's serve, and, eventually, Schüttler breaking Clement right after the play resumed and win, on his third match point on the score of 3–6, 7–5, 6–7(6), 7–6(7), 8–6, after five hours and twelve minutes played on two days, and reach his second Grand Slam semifinal, setting up a clash with Rafael Nadal. The match became historically significant as the second longest men's singles match in terms of time played, in Wimbledon history, the longest remaining a 1989 second round match between Greg Holmes and Todd Witsken, which lasted five hours and twenty-eight minutes.\nThe first semifinal of the women's singles saw four-time winner and defending champion, seventh seed Venus Williams dominate her opponent Elena Dementieva during the first set, winning it 6–1 in thirty-eight minutes, before the Russian fifth seed fought back in the second, breaking Williams right after losing her serve to even the score, and holding to a second set tie-break. The American then left no chances to Dementieva, breaking her repeatedly to win the tie-break 7–3, and claim a 6–1, 7–6(3) victory, after nearly two hours of play, to advance to her thirteenth Grand Slam final since the 1997 US Open, her seventh in Wimbledon. The second semifinal between two-time champion, sixth seed Serena Williams and wild card, WTA No. 133 Zheng Jie followed the same pattern as the first, with Williams dominating her opponent in the first set, winning it 6–2, and the Chinese fighting back in the second, taking the match to a tie-break after holding a set point on Williams's serve. Williams, though, kept her edge on Zheng, winning the tie-break 7–5, to claim a 6–2, 7–6(5) victory, and proceed to her eleventh Grand Slam final since the 1999 US Open, the fourth in Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams's wins marked the first time since Wimbledon 2003 the two sisters would meet in a Grand Slam final, the seventh time overall, with Serena having won five of their six previous Grand Slam final meetings, including the two played in Wimbledon, in 2002 and 2003.\nIn the first men's doubles semifinal, which lasted more than three hours, being interrupted several times by rain delays, World No. 1s and 2006 Wimbledon champions Bob Bryan &amp; Mike Bryan battled a close match against eighth-seeded 2002, 2003 and 2004 champion Jonas Björkman &amp; partner Kevin Ullyett, but the top-ranked Americans lost all three tie-breaks played against their adversaries, allowing Bjorkman &amp; Ullyett to win on the score of 7–6(3), 5–7, 7–6(5), 7–6(9). The win meant Bjorkman would reach his fifteenth Grand Slam doubles final since the 1994 French Open, Ullyett would reach his third one since the 2001 US Open, and the pair would reach their first Grand Slam final together. The other semifinal, between ninth seeds Lukáš Dlouhý &amp; Leander Paes and second seeds Daniel Nestor &amp; Nenad Zimonjić was stopped due to darkness as the latter led 7–6(4), 4–6, 6–1, 3–3.\nThe quarterfinals of the mixed doubles event continued, and saw all-Russian, unseeded pair of Igor Andreev &amp; Maria Kirilenko upset all-Czech pair and third seeds Pavel Vízner &amp; Květa Peschke in straight sets 6–3, 6–4, to reach their first Grand Slam semifinal together. In the second quarterfinal of the bottom half of the draw, unseeded team of men's doubles No. 1 Bob Bryan &amp; former women's doubles No. 1 Samantha Stosur defeated ninth seeds and 2007 French Open mixed champions Andy Ram &amp; Nathalie Dechy 6–4, 6–2, to join Jamie Murray &amp; Liezel Huber in the semifinals. Finally, top seeds Mike Bryan &amp; Katarina Srebotnik took three sets to beat their quarterfinal opponents, fifth-seeded Kevin Ullyett, who had just won his men's doubles semifinal, &amp; Ai Sugiyama, Srebotnik's usual partner in women's doubles, on the score of 6–3, 3–6, 6–3, to set up to a clash with Andreev &amp; Kirilenko, and complete the semifinals line up.\nDay 11.\nThe first semifinal of the men's singles was the eleventh encounter between World No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer, and former World No. 1, now 75th-ranked and victor, earlier in the tournament, of ATP No. 3 Novak Djokovic, Russian Marat Safin, whose appearance in the semifinals was the first in a Grand Slam since he won the 2005 Australian Open, where he defeated Federer in the semifinal. The Swiss broke Safin in his first service game, racing through the first set to take it 6–3, before the Russian raised his level of play, and both players went on keeping their serves to a second set tie-break, which Safin eventually lost 3–7, letting Federer take his two-sets-to-love advantage to pressure him, and eventually break in the last game of the third set to claim a 6–3, 7–6(3), 6–4 victory, in less than two hours. The win meant Federer would reach his sixteenth Grand Slam final, and his sixth consecutive one in Wimbledon, already equalling Björn Borg's record of runs at the tournament, from his first win at the 1976 Wimbledon Championships to his lost final, after having won five consecutive ones, to John McEnroe at the 1981 Wimbledon Championships. The second semifinal opposed ATP No. 2, French Open and Queen's Club Championships winner, and defending finalist Rafael Nadal, to unseeded, 2003 Australian Open runner-up Rainer Schüttler, ATP No. 94, who finished his semifinal against Arnaud Clément only on the previous afternoon, after three-hours-and-a-half of play. Nadal raced early to a 4–0 lead, taking the first set 6–1, before Schüttler started to fight back, breaking the Spanish and dominating him through the second set, keeping his serve until 5–4, when serving to even the score to one-set-all, Nadal broke him, eventually winning the set in a tie-break 7–3, and keeping his edge on the German up to the end of the third set to win, in little more than two hours, on the score of 6–1, 7–6(3), 6–4. The win allowed Nadal to advance to his seventh Grand Slam final, his third consecutive one in Wimbledon, and set up his eighteenth meeting against Roger Federer, the sixth in a Grand Slam final.\nThe second men's doubles semifinal, between ninth seeds Lukáš Dlouhý &amp; Leander Paes and second seeds Daniel Nestor &amp; Nenad Zimonjić, and which was stopped by the night on Day 10 as the latter were leading 7–6(4), 4–6, 6–1, 3–3, resumed, to see the Czech Dlouhy and the Indian, 1999 Wimbledon champion Paes break their opponents and win the fourth set, taking the match to a fifth one, in which 2002 Wimbledon doubles runner-up Nestor &amp; 2004 and 2006 runner-up Zimonjic made the difference, ultimately clinching a 7–6(4), 4–6, 6–1, 4–6, 8–6 victory, to face Jonas Björkman &amp; Kevin Ullyett, and try, for Nestor, to finally complete a career Grand Slam and for Zimonjić, to win his first ever Grand Slam title.\nThe semifinals of the women's doubles took place, first confronting 2000 and 2002 champions and eleventh seeds Serena Williams &amp; Venus Williams, to unseeded Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy &amp; Australian Casey Dellacqua, with the Williams sisters, who lost no set since the beginning of the competition, dominating their opponents throughout the encounter, winning the match 6–3, 6–3, after only an hour of play and advance to their third doubles final in Wimbledon, having won the two first ones. That win also marked the second time since the 2002 Wimbledon Championships Serena and Venus Williams would be facing each other in the singles final, and be present together in the doubles final. The top half of the draw's semifinal took place between top ranked, recent Birmingham and Eastbourne winners and defending champions Cara Black &amp; Liezel Huber, and sixteenth-seeded 2001 doubles champion Lisa Raymond &amp; partner Samantha Stosur, with the latter taking the early advantages in each set, breaking the World No. 1s four times during the encounter and eventually knocking them out of the tournament on the score of 6–3, 6–3, in little more than an hour, to reach their fourth Grand Slam final together, after the 2005 US Open, the 2006 Australian Open and the 2006 French Open.\nIn the first semifinal of the mixed event, top seeds Mike Bryan &amp; Katarina Srebotnik entirely dominated their unseeded opponents Igor Andreev &amp; Maria Kirilenko to win the match on the final score of 6–4, 6–2, after little more than an hour, and proceed to their first Grand Slam final together. The win allowed Mike Bryan to advance to his fourth Grand Slam mixed final, his second in Wimbledon after finishing as the runner-up in 2001, and Srebotnik to advance to her eighth Grand Slam mixed final, her first in Wimbledon. Twelfth-seeded defending champion Jamie Murray &amp; partner, women's doubles No. 1 Liezel Huber made the strongest start of their semifinal against unseeded Bob Bryan &amp; Samantha Stosur quickly taking the first set 6–2 in twenty-one minutes, before Bryan &amp; Stosur started to fight back, taking the second set to a tie-break, easily winning it 7–1, and extending their domination in the third set, eventually taking the match 2–6, 7–6(1), 6–4, to reach their first Grand Slam mixed doubles final together. The final would be Bob Bryan's sixth, the second in Wimbledon, after a 2006 loss, and Stosur's second, after the 2005 Australian Open. The win marked the second time in the year Bob Bryan and Katarina Srebotnik would face each other in a Grand Slam mixed doubles final, having already confronted at the French Open, set up the first ever meeting in a Grand Slam final of Bob and Mike Bryan, and marked the first time, with Stosur's win, a player would be present in both the doubles and the mixed doubles final of Wimbledon since Cara Black in 2004.\nDay 12.\nThe final of the women's singles competition started at 14:00 (UTC+1) on the Centre Court of the Wimbledon's All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. WTA No. 6 and sixth seed, 2002 and 2003 Wimbledon Champion Serena Williams and WTA No. 7 and seventh seed, 2000, 2001, 2005 and 2007 champion Venus Williams met for the third time in a Wimbledon final, and for the seventh time overall in Grand Slam finals, with Serena winning five of the six previous encounters. Serena made the stronger start, breaking her sister in her first service game, and quickly took a 4–2 lead, as Venus struggled with her return. The momentum of the first set then shifted, when Venus started to play more aggressively, breaking Serena to even the score, and breaking her again in the last game to win the set 7–5 after fifty-three minutes. Venus struggled again with her serve in the beginning of the second set, saving a break point in her first service game, She was broken in her second, but broke back to 2–2. Both players then held their serve up to 5–4, when Serena found herself serving to stay in the match at 15–40, saving the first match point, but losing the second on an unforced error to give Venus the break and a 7–5, 6–4 victory after one hour and eleven minutes of play. The win allowed Venus to defend her title and was her fifth Wimbledon title, her seventh Grand Slam title overall.\nThe men's doubles final followed the women's singles' one on Centre Court. The eighth-seeded team of ATP doubles No. 21 and former World No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon doubles champion Jonas Björkman &amp; current ATP doubles No. 14, partner Kevin Ullyett, the oldest pair in the field, both aged thirty-six, met the World No. 2 duo of Daniel Nestor, a Wimbledon 2002 runner-up &amp; Nenad Zimonjić, a finalist at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2004 and 2006. Both teams remained close through the first two sets, with neither pair breaking the other, and each set going to a tie-break, the first won 14–12 by Nestor &amp; Zimonjic, the second 7–3 by Bjorkman &amp; Ullyett. The second seeds proved more efficient in the third set, winning their only break point and holding their advantage to the end to take a two-sets-to-one lead. The fourth set resembled the third, with Nestor &amp; Zimonjic converting their two break points, while their opponents were unable to attack them on their service games. Nestor &amp; Zimonjic won the match 7–6(12), 6–7(3), 6–3, 6–3, after more than two-hours-and-a-half of play, making them the 2008 Wimbledon champions. The victory marked Nestor &amp; Zimonjic's first as a team in a Grand Slam tournament, after finishing as the runners-up of the French Open. It also allowed Nestor to become the twenty-first player in tennis history and the eleventh in the Open Era to complete a career Grand Slam, after winning previously at the 2002 Australian Open, the 2004 US Open and the 2007 French Open. He is also the third male player to complete a career Golden Slam, as Nestor also won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympics.\nThe last final of the day to be played on the Centre Court was the women's doubles'. Eleventh-seeded two-time winning pair of Serena Williams &amp; Venus Williams, who had just won the women's singles crown, met sixteenth-seeded Lisa Raymond, &amp; 2002 champion Samantha Stosur, also in course to play the mixed doubles final in the tournament. The Williams sisters proved to be as dominant through the final as they were during the whole competition, in which they lost no set and knocked out several seeded teams, among them French Open champions Anabel Medina Garrigues &amp; Virginia Ruano Pascual, as Serena &amp; Venus broke twice in each of the sets, saving three break points in the first set, and not facing a single one in the second, to claim the 2008 Wimbledon doubles title after a mere fifty-eight minutes of play, on the score of 6–2, 6–2. The doubles title was Serena &amp; Venus' third in Wimbledon, and the seventh overall together, since the 1999 French Open. The win also marked the third time the sisters won the doubles title of Wimbledon while one of them won the singles title, and the second in which they won the doubles while both of them played the singles final.\nDay 13.\nThe final Sunday, featuring the men's singles final, saw Rafael Nadal win the first Wimbledon title of his career and fifth Grand Slam tournament. No. 1 seed and five-time champion Roger Federer was aiming to equal William Renshaw's record of six consecutive Wimbledon titles (1881–1886), and edge ever closer to Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam titles, of which Federer had 12. Nadal, the No. 2 seed and four-time French Open champion was Federer's challenger for the third consecutive year, and was aiming to become the first man since Björn Borg to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Nadal's countryman, Manuel Santana, the last Spaniard to have won the Wimbledon title (in 1966), said Nadal could take inspiration from Spain's victory in the recent European Championships, which Spain had last won in 1964.\nRain and lightning delayed the final, scheduled for 14:00, until 14:35 (UTC+1). The final itself was a fragmented affair, with two rain delays removing the possibility of an uninterrupted final. However, the playing time made it the longest final in Wimbledon history, at four hours and 48 minutes.\nNadal began well, winning the first set 6–4 in just under an hour, and taking the second by the same scoreline, despite having been down 4–1 at one point. The third set was interrupted by rain delays but the players returned to finish the set with a tie break, which Federer won by seven points to five. The fourth mirrored the third by also going to a tie break, in which Nadal took a 5–2 lead. Nadal was on serve but served a double fault and then was forced by Federer into a hitting a backhand into the net. Later in the tie break, Nadal had two championship points, including one on his serve, which he squandered, with Federer triumphing 10–8, and forcing a final set. The fifth set went only four games before another rain delay; the score was 2–2 (40–40) when they returned. Nadal eventually prevailed, winning the final set 9–7, at 21:16 local time. Nadal celebrated his win by climbing to his family in the crowd, including coach Toni Nadal, and then traversed a roofed area to shake hands with members of Spanish royalty. Pundit and three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe lauded it as \"the greatest match I have ever seen.\" With a final score of 6–4 6–4 6–7(5) 6–7(8) 9–7.\nThe mixed doubles' final was originally scheduled to be played on Centre Court following the conclusion of the men’s singles final. As the latter was suspended due to rain repeatedly and with the risk of daylight running out, the mixed doubles final was moved to a near empty court 1. The Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, met each other in the second siblings final of this year's tournament. The unseeded Bob and Samantha Stosur won the match in straight sets, 7–5, 6–4 against the first seeded Mike and Katarina Srebotnik, after one hour and one minute."

        "text": "The 2018 Super League Grand Final was the 21st official Grand Final and championship-deciding game of Super League XXIII. It was held at Old Trafford in Manchester on 13 October 2018, kick off 18.00. The final was contested by Warrington Wolves and Wigan Warriors, the third time the two sides have met in the Grand Final with previous meetings in 2013 and 2016 being won by Wigan.\nBackground.\nRoute to the Final.\nWigan Warriors.\nWigan finished 2nd in regular season and seven wins out of seven in the Super 8's saw them secure 2nd place in the table. A 14–0 victory over third placed Castleford Tigers in the semi-final earned Wigan a place in their 10th Grand Final.\nWarrington Wolves.\nWarrington finished 4th to earn an away trip to League Leaders Shield winners St. Helens in the semi-finals. Warrington Wolves won 18–13 with a late try by Tom Lineham. Warrington Wolves contested their 4th Grand Final.\nMatch details.\nFirst Half\nWarrington opened the scoring in a cagey first half on 13 minutes, through Josh Charnley, against his former club, as he took in Stefan Ratchford's looping pass before sliding over in the corner. The touchline conversion was missed by Tyrone Roberts. (0–4) Wigan leveled the score on 25 minutes through Dominic Manfredi, marking his first Grand Final appearance since 2015, (missing the 2016 Final due to injury) with a try in the corner, through great work by Oliver Gildart, as he jinked through the line, before giving it to Manfredi out wide to touch down in the corner. (4-4). Sam Tomkins missed the conversion, and the score would remain level.\nOn 31 minutes, a George Williams kick into open space, rolled into the in goal area, and Tom Davies managed to beat Josh Charnley to the ball, and score in the corner. The video referee awarded the try after reviewing the footage, and agreed Davies had got a hand on the ball. Again, Tomkins missed the extras and it would remain 8-4 until half time. \nSecond Half\nThe second half would see Warrington come close early on, as Tom Lineham looked to go over in the corner, but a mob of Wigan defenders led by Manfredi and Tomkins forced him into touch. With time running out, Wigan won a penalty on 70 minutes and despite being close to the halfway line, they elected to kick it. Tomkins again missed the kick and the score remained 8–4. On 77 minutes, Manfredi would seal the win for Wigan as he would take in Sam Tomkins' inch perfect pass, before diving over in the corner, to seal the win. Tomkins again missing the conversion, (12-4). Toby King almost got what would have been a consolation score for Warrington in the last minute of the game, but the video ref determined that he'd dropped the ball in his attempt at scoring and the score would remain 12–4. \nThe win for Wigan Warriors secured a record 22nd Rugby league title while Warrington's 63 years wait to be crowned champions goes on.\nPost-Match\nThis match was Shaun Wane's last game as Wigan coach before going to Scotland Rugby Union, after 7 seasons as head coach of Wigan. It was also the last game before Sam Tomkins left for Catalans, and John Bateman and Ryan Sutton for Canberra. Wigan would win their 5th Grand Final and 22nd Championship overall, in their 10th appearance, evening up their win–loss record in Grand Finals, their last three wins coming against Warrington, whilst Warrington are still waiting to end their long title drought, stretching back to 1955."

        "text": "The 1885 Southern Rugby Union season was the 12th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the third competition for the Gardiner Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season lasted from May till September 1885. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Sydney University. University were awarded the Gardiner Challenge Cup and were crowned premiers by a committee of the Union. The club were undefeated during the premiership season.\nTeams.\nIn 1885, the Union decided to elevate three Junior clubs into the Gardiner Challenge Cup. Arfoma, St. Leonards and Newtown had performed well during the previous season and were given the opportunity to compete for the cup.\nRule changes.\nIn 1885 the Sydney Rugby Premiership continued to develop into a more structured competition. Before the season began, the Southern Rugby Football Union decided to promote three Junior Clubs into the Gardiner Challenge Cup. This took the competing teams to eight. The number of games during the season also increased, with most of the teams playing each other twice. However, at the conclusion of the season, some clubs had not played the same number of games as others. The competition still did not see organised rounds and an official points ladder.\nSeason summary.\nOverall, the season was not seen as being as brilliant as the previous. The Association Cricket Ground became unavailable during the season, which had an effect upon the games being played. This ground was the only one that fenced in the playing field. As a result, many games were interrupted by the crowds encroaching upon the field. The Agricultural Society made their ground available to the Union later in the season, with two games often being played side-by-side. This did see some confusion with players stopping play in one game on hearing the call from the other game.\nDespite a deficit in their defence and kicking, the Sydney University Football Club proved to be the Premier club and were awarded the Gardiner Challenge Cup. The 'Varsity were well organised and displayed consistent form during the season. The team put the same players onto the field each week. As a result, the club were undefeated during the cup campaign with their only losses coming from non-cup games with a weakened team.\nThe Wallaroo Football Club displayed occasional brilliance on the field. On a good day, they demonstrated excellent forward play. However, a heavy schedule of 20 games across all matches saw the club become inconsistent in their performance. In 14 Cup games, the team won 8. Despite being beaten by Burwood, Wallaroo were ranked second for the season due to winning more games.\nLast season's Premiers, Burwood, were considered the more all-round team. They were splendidly led by their captain Samuel Chapman who had spent some time playing in Cambridge. Using the experience gained, he encouraged his players to back each other. The club finished their season with a draw against the eventual champions, displaying the potential of the team. \nLower grades.\nThe Southern Rugby Football Union classified the participating clubs into two groups, Seniors and Juniors. Prior to 1883, all clubs were considered for the Premiership. With the introduction of the Gardiner Challenge Cup, only Senior clubs participated in the competition. The Junior clubs competed with each other, but no award was recognised for their achievements. Matches between Senior and Junior teams were common place, with results in those matches possibly assisting in deciding the final Senior Premiership winner.\nIn 1885, the top Junior Clubs were Balmain Wellington and Rosedale who were both undefeated for the season.\nRepresentative games.\nIntercolonial matches.\nIn 1885, the New South Wales Rugby team visited Brisbane to play two matches against the Queensland team. For the first time, the Gardiner Cup continued to be played. This saw some of the local clubs losing valuable players and were thus unable to form a team to play their matches. Some controversy was present in the newspapers concerning the selection of certain NSW players and the omittance of other players in the team. With this in mind, the Queensland team had the edge in the first match, defeating NSW 14 points to nil. After this success, the Queensland team was seen to be a little over confident heading into the second match. As a result, they were out classed and were defeated by NSW 12 points to 2."

The RCGC instituted several prestigious national golf tournaments. RCGC members decided to establish a new organization in 1955 to facilitate the growth of golf in India beyond the major metropolitan centers, to organize junior level tournaments and to send teams abroad for international events. The Indian Golf Union was established in December 1955 through an initiative undertaken by some senior golfers in Calcutta and supported by golfers in Delhi, Mumbai and Madras. All administrative powers of the RCGC were transferred to the IGU after the latter's establishment, including the right to conduct the Amateur Golf Championship of India. The RCGC, which had established the tournament, also donated the trophy to the IGU.\nA.D. Vickers served as the first President of the IGU, and Major L.B. Hirst, the Secretary of the RCGC, became the IGU's first Secretary. P.R. Surita was appointed as the first Honorary Secretary of the IGU in 1957. The IGU conducted the All-India Amateur Golf Championship at the Delhi Golf club in 1958, the first time the tournament was held outside Calcutta.\nThe IGU became affiliated with the International Golf Federation in 1958.\nThe Union Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports derecognized the IGU on 1 April 2018 for failure to hold elections and non-compliance with the National Sports Code."

        "text": "Ryan Taylor (born June 18, 1992) is an American former professional basketball player. He played college basketball for the Marshall Thundering Herd before playing a season in Iceland with Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur and a season in the CBA with the Indianapolis Blaze.\nCollege career.\nTalyor joined Marshall in 2012 but redshirted his freshman year. He played 31 of 33 games in 2013–2014, starting 29 games and averaging 12.8 points and team leading 7.2 rebounds. In 2014–2015 he led Marshall in scoring and rebounding, with 14.1 points and 8.6 rebounds per game, and was selected to the All-Conference USA Third Team. In November 2016, Taylor was suspended by coach Dan D'Antoni for one game after he had been ejected from Marshalls 71–61 victory over Jackson State. Taylor had fouled out in the game and had continued to berate the referee from the bench, leading to his ejection. On January 10, 2017, Taylor was named the Oscar Robertson National Player of the Week after he averaged 25.3 points and 13.3 rebounds in Marshall's three victories during the week of January 2–7. During the season he passed Dan D'Antoni and Mike D'Antoni on Marshalls all-time scoring list and became the 50th player to break the 1000 point barrier in the schools history. In 2017 he became the first Marshall player to reach career totals of 1,500 points, 800 rebounds and 250 assists.\nProfessional career.\nTaylor signed with Úrvalsdeild karla club ÍR in September 2017. He quickly established himself as one of the top players in the country and in December 2017, he was named the best player of the first half of the season. On March 5, Taylor made the game saving block on Haukar's Haukur Óskarsson three point attempt at the buzzer in ÍR's 64–62 victory. During the regular season, he averaged team highs of 21.9 points and 10.4 rebounds in 22 games.\nÍR ended the regular season with the second best record in the league and faced Stjarnan in the first round of the playoffs. In the third game of the series on March 22, Taylor struck Stjarnan's center, Hlynur Bæringsson, in the back of the head which resulted in Hlynur getting a concussion and missing both the rest of the game and the rest of the playoffs. As the referees did not see the hit clearly, Taylor was not ejected from the game and ÍR won a 67–64 victory. Two days later, Taylor received a three-game suspension from the league for the hit. Without Taylor, ÍR managed to edge out victory in the fourth game with a 24-point, 21-rebound performance by Danero Thomas, winning the series 3–1. Taylor returned in the third game of ÍR's semi-finals series against Tindastóll. After splitting the first two games, Tindastóll went on to win the next two, eliminating ÍR 3-1 from the playoffs.\nIn 2019, he played for the Indianapolis Blaze in the Central Basketball Association where he helped the team to the CBA championship. In 5 games for the Blaze, Taylor averaged 11.0 points and 7.2 rebounds per game.\nThe Basketball Tournament.\nIn July 2018, Taylor played for the West Virginia Wildcats in The Basketball Tournament (TBT), a winner-take-all $2 million, single-elimination event. He had a double-double, 16 points and 10 rebounds, in the Wildcats first game, an 114–87 victory against 17th-seeded Charlotte Chess Center on July 20. The following day he led the team with 18 points and 11 rebounds but was unable to prevent a 99–68 loss against Scarlet &amp; Gray, a team of mostly Ohio State men's basketball alumni, which knocked them out of the tournament. Taylor has subsequently played for Herd That, a team rostered primarily with Marshall alumni.\nCoaching career.\nIn 2019, Taylor was named the head boys' basketball coach at St. Joseph Central Catholic High School in Huntington, West Virginia."

        "title": "Archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Qualification",
        "text": "There are 128 qualifying places available for archery at the 2020 Summer Olympics: 64 for men and 64 for women. The qualification standards were released by World Archery in March 2018. \nEach National Olympic Committee (NOC) is permitted to enter a maximum of six competitors, three per gender. NOCs that qualify teams for a particular gender are able to send a three-member team to the team event and also have each member compete in the individual event. There are 12 team spots for each gender, thus qualifying 36 individuals through team qualification. All other NOCs may earn a maximum of one quota place per gender for the individual events.\nSix places are reserved for Japan as the host nation, and a further four will be decided by the Tripartite Commission. The remaining 118 places are then allocated through a qualification process, in which archers earn quota places for their respective NOCs, though not necessarily for themselves.\nThere is no qualification process prior to the 2020 Games for the mixed team event. Instead, qualification for that event is done through the ranking rounds at the beginning of the Games. Each NOC that has qualified at least one man and one woman will have the scores of that NOC's top-scoring man and top-scoring woman in the ranking round summed; the top 16 NOCs will qualify for mixed team competition.\nTo be eligible to participate in the Olympic Games after the NOC has obtained a quota place, all archers must have achieved the following minimum qualification score (MQS):\nThe MQS must have been achieved between the start of the 2019 World Archery Championships and the final entry at a registered World Archery event.\nQualifying standards.\nQualification occurs through a hierarchy of events rather than based on dates, so an NOC that earns qualification through an earlier low-priority event might vacate that quota spot if it later earns qualification in a higher-priority event (this particularly affects the Asian Games, held before the World Championships). The priority is (1) World Championships, (2) continental games, (3) continental championships, (4) final qualification tournaments.\nThe top eight teams in the team event at the World Championships will each qualify a team for the Olympics. If the host, Japan, is one of the top eight, an additional team qualification quota place will be awarded at the Final Team Qualification Tournament. The Final Team Qualification Tournament will fill out the rest of the 12 team quota places, with either three or four teams qualifying depending on whether Japan uses its guaranteed host place or qualifies through competition (including through the Final Team Qualification Tournament itself).\nFor the mixed team events at continental games, the winning team earns one Olympic quota place per gender.\nThe top four finishers in the individual event at the World Championships who are not part of one of the eight best teams will qualify. The World Championships will hold ranking brackets as necessary to determine the placing. For Europe, Asia, and the Americas, one quota place each is available through the continental games. All five continents will hold continental qualification tournaments, with specified numbers of quota places available per continent. A Final Individual Qualification Tournament will be held at the end of the qualification period; initially, one quota place is available through that tournament but more may be available if places from other events are not used."

        "title": "Scott Smith (ice hockey)",
        "text": "Scott Smith (born November 27, 1966) is a Canadian former ice hockey executive, who worked for Hockey Canada from 1995 until 2022. He served as vice-president and chief operating officer (COO) from 2007 to 2016, as president and COO from 2016 to 2022, and as president and chief executive officer in 2022. Smith oversaw growth business operations for Hockey Canada, managed International Ice Hockey Federation competitions, and negotiated public–private partnerships, and television deals. He resigned in October 2022, amid calls for leadership change due to the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born November 27, 1966, in Bathurst, New Brunswick. He graduated from Bathurst High School in 1984. He completed an education degree at the University of New Brunswick in 1988. Smith was executive director from 1991 to 1995, of the New Brunswick Amateur Hockey Association. He served as an assistant coach for the UNB Varsity Reds during the 1994–95 season, and was an instructor for coaching and player development.\nHockey Canada.\nVice-president.\nSmith began working for Hockey Canada in 1995, as the manager of hockey operations for the Atlantic Canada centre of excellence in Saint John, New Brunswick. He relocated to the Calgary, Alberta office in 1997, becoming the director of operations, and in 1998 was promoted to vice-president of Hockey Canada business operations. The change coincided with the retirement of Murray Costello, and Bob Nicholson becoming president. In 2003, Smith was named by The Globe and Mail in its 40-under-40 list. Smith became the senior vice-president in charge of business operations in 2005, then senior executive vice-president in 2006, and chief operating officer (COO) in 2007. Smith was responsible for the day-to-day business of Hockey Canada under Nicholson. \nSmith's management and marketing of international events was cited by the Stanford Graduate School of Business as a reason for the growth of Hockey Canada. His planning of programs has created profit margins, and increased television ratings. His work included organizing the IIHF World U20 Championships and the IIHF World Women's Championships hosted in Canada, negotiating a broadcasting agreement with The Sports Network and Réseau des sports, and Hockey Canada sponsorships and licensing. He also sat on the board of directors for the International Hockey Heritage Centre, the International Ice Hockey Federation Marketing Committee, and the IIHF 100th Anniversary Committee. \nSmith sought public–private partnerships for Hockey Canada with mutual value, sustainable relationships with similar goals, and realistic goals that Hockey Canada can deliver to partners, to get more funding and sponsorships in the future, instead of relying on donations and government subsidy. Smith said that government subsidy is five to seven per cent of the total Hockey Canada budget, distributed to coaching and officiating development, the national teams for Olympic participation, some is from Sport Canada. Smith negotiated with Canadian Tire, and Bauer Hockey in 2014, to create the First Shift Program. The program includes equipment for new players to the game, and a six-week program to learn the game. As of 2018, First Shift helped 15,500 Canadian children play hockey, and made its debut in Inuvik, Northwest Territories.\nSmith negotiated Hockey Canada's relationship with Molson Brewery such that it is different at adult events, and youth events below the legal drinking age, and ensured there are guidelines for usage of the Hockey Canada brand. He has also negotiated deals to perpetuate Hockey Canada Foundation philanthropy, seeking corporate sponsors with an interest in youth hockey, and to run events with hockey alumni, and involve community leaders, such as a partnership with the city of Montreal and the Montreal Canadiens, to provide hockey for underprivileged youth. Smith pursued an ethical consumerism policy for Hockey Canada and its merchandise suppliers. Smith said that Hockey Canada wants \"to keep up to the highest standards of transparency\", and work with labour rights groups, including the Worker Rights Consortium and the Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production.\"\nSmith spoke at the World Hockey Summit in 2010, and expressed concerns that youth hockey was no longer growing in Canada. He stated that 9.1% of Canadian children from ages 9 to 15 were playing ice hockey, a figure which had changed in the last decade. He felt that the increasing cost of playing, and increasing cultural diversity which embraced other sporting options and contributing factors; and it would be necessary for minor hockey associations to promote the game and make it easier to participate.\nPresident.\nPrior to becoming COO of Hockey Canada, Smith was not well known outside of hockey, and seemed to be an internal replacement for Nicholson when the latter retired in July 2014. Smith was considered for the presidency when Tom Renney was hired instead. On December 29, 2016, Hockey Canada announced that Smith would replace Renney as president on July 1, 2017. Smith kept his role as COO, while Renney remained as CEO. Renney said that by promoting Smith, \"there was an opportunity for Hockey Canada to be more effective in fulfilling its mandate\", and that he and Smith have “very complementary skill sets and approaches”. Renney said that their respective \"jobs really won’t change a whole lot, other than that we make ourselves more diverse\". The change created a higher public profile for Smith, while he continued to oversee regular business operations.\nSmith said that one his first objectives after becoming president was to \"deepen the quality of the hockey experience\" and to attract more players and coaches into the game. He also believed that Hockey Canada's existing coaching, officiating, and respect in sport programs are top notch. He noted that as of 2016, Hockey Canada had approximately 675,000 registered players, and he wanted to increase that and give more players an opportunity to be at the World Juniors. He implemented new analytical measures at Hockey Canada to track new players to the game, and retention rate of them. He also began a floorball program, and distributing children's literature to reach out to newer Canadians and ethnic communities, in attempt to have hockey teams reflect the multiculturalism in Canada.\nSmith became president of Hockey Canada at the same time which the organization was criticized about the ticket prices and the lack of attendance at the 2015 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, and the 2017 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, co-hosted in Toronto and Montreal. At the previous events Canada hosted, the total attendance in Calgary and Edmonton was 455,342 fans, Ottawa drew 453,282 fans, but attendance dropped to 366,370 fans in Canada’s largest cities. Smith said that the Toronto market was saturated by other events such as the 2016 World Cup of Hockey, the NHL Centennial Classic, the 104th Grey Cup, the MLS Cup 2016, the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, and the playoff success of the Toronto Raptors, and the Toronto Blue Jays. Ticket sales in Montreal struggled, despite prices being lowered by 30% in 2017 compared to 2015, and a marketing change to sell more individual games, and fewer package deals. Despite the poor attendance, Hockey Canada achieved 80% of its goal of $21 million in ticket sales, to reinvest into the community and the participating teams.\nLater in 2017, Smith announced a new deal with BDO Global in Canada, to begin the Goals for Kids program, and expand its partnership of events such as the World U-17 Hockey Challenge, the World Junior A Challenge, the World Sledge Hockey Challenge, the National Women's Under-18 Championship, the Esso Cup, the Telus Cup, and the RBC Cup. The deal included a set donation per goal scored by teams at those events, which is reinvested in the host communities as a legacy program. Smith was optimistic that National Hockey League players would participate in ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but was prepared for alternative measures. He and Renney collaborated regularly with team management of Sean Burke with the men's national team, and Melody Davidson with the women's national team to ensure that staff and athletes were prepared to perform on the ice. In 2018, Smith extended the partnership with Bauer Hockey for another eight years, who have been the official equipment supplier for the national teams since 1996.\nOn July 1, 2022, Smith succeeded Renney as chief executive officer of Hockey Canada while retaining the position of president.\nIn July 2022, Smith testified at a probe by the Department of Canadian Heritage committee into Hockey Canada's handling of sexual assault allegations in 2018, and whether to remove the freeze on funding by the government to Hockey Canada. Smith stated that Hockey Canada paid to settle 21 cases of alleged sexual assault since 1989, including the use of a fund supplied by player registration fees. He dismissed calls by the committee for him to resign, and wished to resolve the issue. He also released a 19-page document which outlined an action plan to address the concerns of the Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal, and to change the culture within hockey.\nAmid calls for leadership change due to the scandal, the board of directors and Smith resigned from Hockey Canada on October 11, 2022. Nine months later, his replacement was announced as Katherine Henderson, the first female president of Hockey Canada.\nPersonal life.\nAs of 2018, Smith resides in Calgary with his wife, Karen. He has one son, who grew up playing hockey. Smith has family in the Bathurst area, and a summer cottage on Chaleur Bay. He considers himself fortunate to have a career in hockey, and is grateful for its experiences, highlighted by the gold medals won by the men's and women's ice hockey teams at the Winter Olympic Games from 2002 to 2014."

Alex Morgan scored five times, tying a tournament and team record set by Michelle Akers for most goals scored by a player in a single World Cup match, while four of her teammates scored their first World Cup goals in their debut at the tournament. The U.S. team were later criticised for celebrating their later goals during the match, with some media commentators and former players calling it disrespectful, but the celebrations were defended by other media commentators, the team's players and members of the opposing Thai bench.\n&lt;section begin=F2 /&gt;&lt;section end=F2 /&gt;\nSweden vs Thailand.\n&lt;section begin=F3 /&gt;&lt;section end=F3 /&gt;\nUnited States vs Chile.\nThe United States fielded a reserve squad with seven changes to the starting lineup to rest its players ahead of the final group stage match against Sweden. Carli Lloyd scored in the 11th minute from the edge of the penalty area and Julie Ertz added a second with a header on a corner kick in the 26th minute. Lloyd scored her second goal of the match in the 35th minute, heading in another corner kick, and missed a penalty kick in the 81st minute that would have given her a hat-trick. Chilean goalkeeper Christiane Endler made several major saves as her team was outshot 26–1, and was named the player of the match for her efforts.

It began on 22 June with the round of 16 and ended on 7 July with the final match, held at the Parc Olympique Lyonnais in Décines-Charpieu. A total of 16 teams (the top two teams from each group, along with the four best third-placed teams) advanced to the knockout stage to compete in a single-elimination style tournament.\nAll times listed are local, CEST ().\nFormat.\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each), where each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution. If still tied after extra time, the match was decided by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winner.\nFIFA set out the following schedule for the round of 16:\nCombinations of matches in the round of 16.\nIn the round of 16, the four third-placed teams were matched with the winners of groups A, B, C, and D. The specific match-ups involving the third-placed teams depend on which four third-placed teams qualified for the round of 16:\nQualified teams.\nThe top two placed teams from each of the six groups, plus the four best-placed third teams, qualified for the knockout stage.\nBracket.\n&lt;section begin=Bracket /&gt;&lt;section end=Bracket /&gt;\nRound of 16.\nGermany vs Nigeria.\nGerman captain Alexandra Popp opened the scoring for her side in the 20th minute after heading in Lina Magull's corner from close range. In the 26th minute, Germany were awarded a penalty after Evelyn Nwabuoku was judged to have fouled Magull in the box after missing a clearance. Sara Däbritz converted the resulting penalty by scoring low to Chiamaka Nnadozie's left. Nigeria missed a great scoring chance early in the second half, when substitute Rasheedat Ajibade's low cross was missed by Nigerian captain Desire Oparanozie. In the 82nd minute, Germany scored their third goal when Halimatu Ayinde's misjudged back pass played in Lea Schüller, who shot low to the far post to seal the game for Germany.\n&lt;section begin=R16-1 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-1 /&gt;\nNorway vs Australia.\nAustralia started the match quickly: Caitlin Foord's through ball found Sam Kerr at the edge of the penalty area within 30 seconds. Kerr dribbled past Maren Mjelde, but shot just wide of Ingrid Hjelmseth's goal. At the half-hour mark, Karina Sævik's curling pass played in Isabell Herlovsen, who shot past Lydia Williams to give Norway the lead. Minutes before half-time, Australia were awarded a penalty after Maria Thorisdottir was judged to have handled Kerr's cross from the right. A subsequent VAR check revealed that Thorisdottir touched the ball with her shoulder and the penalty call was reversed. Kerr would have a goal ruled out in the 60th minute after she was judged to be offside. Elise Kellond-Knight equalised for Australia in the 83rd minute after her corner kick evaded all contact and at the far post. Caroline Graham Hansen almost won Norway the match in stoppage time when her curling strike from the edge of the penalty area struck the inside of the post and rolled along the goal line. The first period of extra time saw Williams make two strong saves to deny Norway, as well as Alanna Kennedy receive a red card after fouling Lisa-Marie Utland.\nAfter a relatively tame second period of extra time, the match went to a penalty shoot-out. Graham Hansen scored the first penalty for Norway, shooting low to Williams left after she dove the wrong way. Kerr went first for Australia but sent her shot high and wide of the goal. After Guro Reiten copied her method, Emily Gielnik saw her low effort saved by Hjelmseth, who dove to her right to make the stop. After both Maren Mjelde and Steph Catley scored their penalties, Ingrid Syrstad Engen slotted into the bottom right corner to send Norway into the quarter-finals.\n&lt;section begin=R16-2 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-2 /&gt;\nEngland vs Cameroon.\nIn the 12th minute, England were awarded an indirect free kick in Cameroon's penalty area after goalkeeper Annette Ngo Ndom was judged to have picked up a back-pass from Augustine Ejangue. England captain Steph Houghton scored the free kick by shooting low into the bottom right corner. England doubled their lead in first half stoppage time when Ellen White received a pass from Lucy Bronze just inside the penalty area and sent a low left-footed shot past Ndom. Early in the second half, Ajara Nchout appeared to get a goal back for Cameroon after firing a Gabrielle Onguéné cutback into the top corner, but the goal was disallowed when a VAR check showed that Onguéné was offside in the build-up to the goal. Alexandra Takounda missed a great chance just after being brought in when she collected Alex Greenwood's weak back pass in front of goal. However, her effort was saved by Karen Bardsley. England added another goal in the 58th minute when Greenwood hit Toni Duggan's low driven corner into the net at the far post.\nThe fixture attracted considerable controversy. The actions of the Cameroonian players, including delaying the restart after England's second and third goals, as well as what was perceived to be deliberately rough play, prompted a FIFA investigation into their actions. Match referee Qin Liang also received significant criticism for failing to punish several Cameroonian infractions, and was seen to have lost control of the game. &lt;section begin=R16-3 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-3 /&gt;\nFrance vs Brazil.\n&lt;section begin=R16-4 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-4 /&gt;\nSpain vs United States.\n&lt;section begin=R16-5 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-5 /&gt;\nSweden vs Canada.\n&lt;section begin=R16-6 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-6 /&gt;\nItaly vs China PR.\n&lt;section begin=R16-7 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-7 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Japan.\n&lt;section begin=R16-8 /&gt;&lt;section end=R16-8 /&gt;\nQuarter-finals.\nNorway vs England.\n&lt;section begin=QF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF1 /&gt;\nFrance vs United States.\n&lt;section begin=QF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF2 /&gt;\nItaly vs Netherlands.\n&lt;section begin=QF3 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF3 /&gt;\nGermany vs Sweden.\n&lt;section begin=QF4 /&gt;&lt;section end=QF4 /&gt;\nSemi-finals.\nEngland vs United States.\nWith the win, the United States extended their winning streak at the Women's World Cup to eleven matches, breaking the ten-match record of Norway set between 1995 and 1999, having last drawn against Sweden in the 2015 group stage. The U.S. also extended their undefeated streak to sixteen World Cup matches, breaking the record of fifteen set by Germany between 2003 and 2011, last losing against Sweden in the 2011 group stage (matches decided by penalty shoot-outs are counted as draws).\n&lt;section begin=SF1 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF1 /&gt;\nNetherlands vs Sweden.\n&lt;section begin=SF2 /&gt;&lt;section end=SF2 /&gt;\nThird place play-off.\n&lt;section begin=TPP /&gt;&lt;section end=TPP /&gt;"

Similar regulations also apply to the players competing in the doubles, as the NOCs (National Olympic Committees) can enter a maximum of two pairs if both are ranked in the top eight, while the remaining NOCs are entitled to one until the quota of 16 highest-ranked pairs is filled. \nOn May 28, 2021, the Badminton World Federation had confirmed that there is no further tournament to be played inside the qualifying window due to events being cancelled or postponed from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As such, while the qualification period technically closes on 15 June 2021, the current Race to Tokyo rankings list will not now be changed prior to that date, and the current standings are the final standings for the purposes of qualification. Further places may yet be made available, however, by withdrawals.\nQualifying standards.\nQualification of these games will be based on the BWF ranking list to be published on 15 June 2021, which will be based on results achieved during the period 29 April 2019 to 15 March 2020, and 4 January 2021 to 13 June 2021, providing a total of 16 pairs in each doubles event, and an initial allocation of 38 players in each singles event in the following criteria:\nEach of the five continental confederations will be guaranteed at least one entry in each singles and doubles event (this is called the Continental Representation Place system). If this has not been satisfied by the entry selection method described above, the highest ranked player or pair from the respective continent will qualify. An NOC can qualify players or pairs in a maximum of two events through the Continental Representation Place system; if a NOC qualifies for more than two events through the Continental Representation Place system, the NOC must choose which of them are qualified, and the quota place declined will be offered to the next NOC's eligible player or pair.\nHost nation Japan is entitled to enter a male and a female badminton player in each of the singles tournaments, but more than two players may be permitted if they achieve the qualifying regulations. Meanwhile, six quota places are made available to eligible NOCs through the Tripartite Commission Invitation, with three each in the men's and women's singles. The Tripartite Commission invitation places count for the Continental Representation Place system.\nFor any player who qualifies in both a doubles event and a singles event, an unused quota place will be allocated to the next best ranked eligible athlete of a respective gender in the singles events on the BWF Ranking List as of 15 June 2021. This ensures that a total of 86 men and 86 women qualify, with the individual event fields expanding from 38 to accommodate additional players.\nOfficial ranking.\nAll of the event was postponed and rescheduled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWomen's singles.\n\"Players highlighted in red states they are not participating at the 2020 Olympics\"\nMen's doubles.\n\"Pairs highlighted in red states they are not participating at the 2020 Olympics\""

        "title": "2018 NRL Grand Final",
        "text": "The 2018 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2018 National Rugby League season and was played on Sunday September 30 at Sydney's ANZ Stadium. The match was contested between minor premiers the Sydney Roosters and defending premiers the Melbourne Storm. In front of a crowd of 82,688, Sydney won the match 21-6 to claim their 14th premiership title and their first since 2013. Roosters five-eighth Luke Keary was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal as the game's official man of the match.\nThe match was preceded by the inaugural NRL Women's Premiership Grand Final and the 2018 NRL State Championship. Pre-match entertainment was headlined Sydney alternative rock band Gang of Youths. Australian singer Samantha Jade performed the Australian National anthem. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network.\nBackground.\nIt was the first time the Melbourne Storm and the Sydney Roosters contested for an NRL premiership, with both teams having made the most grand final appearances since the beginning of the NRL era in 1998. Only on six occasions since 1998 has there been a grand final that did not feature either club. Both sides have also claimed every minor premiership since 2013, with the Roosters finishing first in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018, and the Storm doing the same in 2016 and 2017. The Roosters qualified for their first grand final since they won the premiership in 2013. The club had reached the preliminary finals in 2014, 2015, and 2017, yet were denied a grand final berth on each occasion when they were defeated by the South Sydney Rabbitohs, Brisbane Broncos and North Queensland Cowboys, respectively. The Storm qualified for their third-straight grand final, replicating the milestone they achieved in 2006, 2007 and 2008. They are the first NRL side to make three consecutive grand finals on more than one occasion. It was Trent Robinson's second grand final in his sixth year coaching the Roosters, while Craig Bellamy equalled Wayne Bennett in reaching eight grand finals as a first grade coach.\nSydney and Melbourne finished first and second on the premiership ladder respectively, making up a top four in which all teams (together with the South Sydney and Cronulla-Sutherland) finished on 34 points. The sides faced each other only once during the regular season, with the Storm edging out a 9-8 victory over the Roosters at Adelaide Oval courtesy of a Cameron Smith field goal. Having a double home game advantage, both teams defeated the third-placed Rabbitohs and fourth-placed Sharks to earn a week off from the semi-finals and a place into the grand final. Sydney, playing at Allianz Stadium, defeated the Sharks 21-12 in the second qualifying final. In the preliminary final, they defeated the Rabbitohs 12-4 in front of a record crowd of 44,380 in the last ever NRL game held at Allianz Stadium before its scheduled knock-down and rebuild. Melbourne, playing at AAMI Park, narrowly defeated the Souths 29-28 in the first qualifying final, before beating their 2016 grand final opponents Cronulla-Sutherland 22-6 to join the Roosters in the premiership decider. Sydney and Melbourne last played each other in the finals in 2015, where the fourth-placed Storm defeated the minor-premiership winning Roosters 20-18 in the first week of the finals.\nTeams.\nThe grand final would be Billy Slater's final game before his retirement after playing 319 first grade games in the NRL, becoming the 16th player to finish their career playing over 300 games at one club. However, many felt Slater was extremely lucky to be playing in the game after being charged for a shoulder charge against Cronulla player Sosaia Feki in the preliminary final the week before. The judiciary cleared Slater of any wrongdoing, presenting him with the opportunity to win a grand final in the final game of his illustrious career. Melbourne captain Cameron Smith surpassed Darren Lockyer in becoming the most capped finals player in the NRL, with 36 appearances. Brodie Croft, Joe Stimson, Christian Welch, and Brandon Smith were the only new additions to the Storm's grand final winning squad from the previous year. Roosters halfback Cooper Cronk played in his eighth grand final, after playing all seven previous grand finals for the Storm; he equalled Steve Menzies in becoming the fourth most-capped NRL player in history; he also became the first player to win back-to-back premierships with different clubs since Johnny Mayes accomplished the feat in 1973 with Manly-Warringah then 1974 with Eastern Suburbs. Daniel Tupou, Jared Waerea-Hargreaves, Jake Friend, Boyd Cordner, and Mitchell Aubusson were the last remaining members from their 2013 premiership winning squad, while Frank-Paul Nu'uausala wasn't selected to play. Luke Keary was the only other Roosters player to have experienced premiership success, having played for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in their victorious 2014 Grand Final.\nAftermath.\nAs premiership winners, the Sydney Roosters qualified to play in the 2019 World Club Challenge. Against the Super League XXIII champions the Wigan Warriors, the Roosters won the match 20-8 at Wigan's DW Stadium."

        "title": "North Harbour Club Rugby Champions",
        "text": "The North Harbour Rugby Union club rugby title has been contested since the formation of the North Harbour Rugby Union in New Zealand in 1985. The current trophy awarded to the winner is the ASB Bank Cup. The Premier Grade championship cup has also been named the New Zealand Couriers Cup The current champions are North Shore RFC. The Reserve Grade Championship Cup is named the \"Stuart Cup\" after North Shore Rugby Club stalwart Jim Stuart who donated the Cup to the North Harbour Rugby Union in 1985. From 1985 to 1996 Harbour club finals were contested at Onewa Domain. Since 1997 all Club finals have been held at North Harbour Stadium. Club finals are usually held in July.\nEast Coast Bays won the inaugural title in 1985. The most successful team in the competitions history is Takapuna, the current champions, who have won the title 13 times including 7 straight titles from 1994 to 2000 and 4 titles from 2006 to 2009. North Shore have won the title 7 times, with Massey winning 6 titles, and with Northcote winning 5. Takapuna RFC and North Shore RFC are the 2 only Harbour clubs that have won an Auckland RFU Premiership, Shore in 1899 and Takapuna in 1940 and 1980. Takapuna is the only club of the 2 that has been awarded the Gallaher Shield.\nAs of 2022, Glenfield RFC, North Harbour Marist RFC, Mahurangi RFC and Kumeu RFC are yet to win a Premiership. In 2012 a combined Kumeu and Helensville team called the Western Pioneers won a premiership when they defeated Silverdale at North Harbour Stadium. Both clubs went their separate ways in 2015. \nAs of 2022, some teams that previously played in the premier one grade - such as Royal Navy RFC, Glenfield RFC, and Marist North Harbour RFC - no longer have teams in the grade. Most clubs, with the exclusion of the latter, field teams in the premier 2 competition instead.\nOnly three clubs across the grades have won over ten Championships. Takapuna Premiers with 13 Premierships, North Shore Senior Reserves with 13 Reserve Grade championships and Takapuna Under 21s with 10 Under 21 Championships.\nJointly, between most North Harbour clubs, there is a premier women's team - entered in the wider Auckland women's grade - the Albany Barbarians.\nNorth Harbour Secondary Schools 1st XV Rugby.\nSince 1985 the North Harbour secondary schools rugby competition has been run during the winter rugby season. The most successful school in this competition is Westlake Boys' High School who has won 17 championships since 1988. Westlake's closest rival is Rosmini College with 8 championships. Takapuna Grammar is the only school in this competition that won an Auckland Secondary schools 1st XV competition when they shared a championship with Auckland Grammar in 1941.\nThe biggest rivalry in the competition is between Westlake Boys' High School and Rosmini College. Westlake Boys' High School is an all-boys state school located in the suburb of Forrest Hill, whilst Rosmini College is a state integrated catholic boys' school located slightly south in the suburb of Takapuna. The schools are located less than 2.1 km apart. The first known game between Westlake Boys and Rosmini took place in 1980 with Rosmini winning that day 18 points to 7.\nIn recent seasons Manurewa High School (from Counties Manukau) and Whangarei Boys High school (from Northland) have joined the NHSS 1st XV competition. Whangarei Boys High School made the final for the first time in 2019 and lost to Westlake Boys'.\nThe Woodhouse Shield is the NHSS rugby equivalent of the Ranfurly shield. The current holder of the shield is Westlake Boys' High School.\nThe eight schools that currently compete in the NHSS 1st XV competition, and their number of championship wins, are:\nWestlake BHS (17), Rosmini College (8), Massey High School (6), Rangitoto College (2), Takapuna Grammar (2), Whangarei BHS (0), Manurewa High School (0).\nOver recent years, the number of participating teams in the 1A competition has dropped, with the following teams - bar the last two - now competing in the NHSS 1B competition alongside 2nd XV teams from Rosmini and Westlake Boys':\nBirkenhead College, Northcote College, Long Bay College, Whangaparaoa College, Hato Petera College, Glenfield College.\nThe girls' equivalent to 1st XV secondary school rugby is the 12-a-side Youth 17 competition.\nNorth Harbour Club Rugby Finals.\nSenior Reserves/Senior B/ The Stuart Cup\n1985 East Coast Bays(1)-Runners up Northcote\n1986 North Shore (1)-Runners up East Coast Bays\n1987 North Shore (2) -Runners up East Coast Bays\n1988 East Coast Bays (2)-Runners up North Shore \n1989 North Shore (3)-Runners up Northcote\n1990 East Coast Bays(3)Runners up \n1991 East Coast Bays(4)-Runners up Takapuna \n1992 East Coast Bays(5)-Runners up Takapuna \n1993 East Coast Bays(6)-Runners up Massey \n1994 Takapuna(1)-Runners up Massey \n1995 Massey(1)-Runners up Takapuna\n1996 Massey(2)-Runners up Takapuna\n1997 Takapuna(2)-Runners up Glenfield\n1998 North Shore(4)-Runners up Takapuna \n1999 Takapuna(3)-Runners up Northcote \n2000 North Shore(5)-Runners up East Coast Bays\n2001 East Coast Bays(7)-Runners up North Shore \n2002 North Shore(6)-Runners up East Coast Bays\n2003 Massey(3)-Runners up North Shore \n2004 Massey(4)-Runners up Silverdale \n2005 Massey(5)-Runners up Northcote\n2006 North Shore(7)-Runners up Massey\n2007 Northcote(1)-Runners up North Shore\n2008 North Shore(8)-Runners up Northcote \n2009 Marist(1)-Runners up East Coast Bays\n2010 North Shore(9)-Runners up Massey \n2011 Silverdale(1)-Runners up Northcote \n2012 North Shore(10)-Runners up East Coast Bays \n2013 Northcote (2)-Runners up North Shore \n2014 North Shore(11)-Runners up Northcote \n2015 Northcote(3)-Runners up North Shore\n2016 North Shore(12)-Runners up Northcote \n2017 Northcote(4)-Runners up Kumeu \n2018 Northcote(5)-Runners up East Coast Bays \n2019 North Shore (13)-Runners up East Coast Bays\n2020 Season abandoned due to COVID-19\n2021 Northcote (6)-Runners up Takapuna\nUnder 21 Championships\n1985 Takapuna (1) \n1986 Takapuna (2)\n1987 Glenfield(1) \n1988 East Coast Bays(1) \n1989 East Coast Bays(2) \n1990 East Coast Bays(3) \n1991 Takapuna (3)\n1992 East Coast Bays(4) \n1993 Massey(1) \n1994 North Shore (1) \n1995 Takapuna (4) \n1996 Takapuna (5) \n1997 Takapuna (6) \n1998 North Shore(2) \n1999 Takapuna (7) \n2000 Marist (1)\n2001 Takapuna (8) \n2002 Northcote (1) \n2003 Northcote (2) \n2004 Silverdale (1) \n2005 Northcote (3)\n2006 Takapuna (9)\n2007 Massey (2)\n2008 Glenfield(2) \n2009 North Shore(3)\n2010 North Shore(4) \n2011 Silverdale (2) \n2012 Takapuna(10) \n2013 Northcote (4) \n2014 Kumeu (1)\n2015 Northcote (5)\n2016 Kumeu (2)\n2017 East Coast Bays (5)\n2018 East Coast Bays (6)\n2019 East Coast Bays (7)\n2020 Season abandoned due to COVID-19\n2021 East Coast Bays (8)\nNorth Harbour Secondary schools Rugby First XV \n1985 Birkenhead College (1) \n1986 Hato Petera College (1)\n1987 Rosmini College(1) \n1988 Westlake Boys High School (1) \n1989 Westlake Boys High School (2) \n1990 Rangitoto College (1) \n1991 Rangitoto College (2)\n1992 Massey High School (1)\n1993 Rosmini College (2)\n1994 Rosmini College (3) \n1995 Westlake Boys High School (3) \n1996 Westlake Boys High School (4) \n1997 Westlake Boys High School (5) \n1998 Westlake Boys High School (6) \n1999 Massey High School (2) \n2000 Westlake Boys High School (7)\n2001 Rosmini College (4)\n2002 Massey High School (3)\n2003 Rosmini College (5)\n2004 Massey High School (4) \n2005 Westlake Boys High School (8)\n2006 Westlake Boys High School (9)\n2007 Massey High School (5)/Takapuna Grammar (1)(shared)\n2008 Westlake Boys High School (10)\n2009 Rosmini College (6)\n2010 Westlake Boys High School (11) \n2011 Massey High School (6) \n2012 Westlake Boys High School (12)\n2013 Westlake Boys High School (13) \n2014 Westlake Boys High School (14)\n2015 Rosmini College (7)\n2016 Westlake Boys High School (15) \n2017 Rosmini College (8)\n2018 Westlake Boys High School (16)/Takapuna Grammar (2) shared\n2019 Westlake Boys High School (17)\n2020 Season abandoned due to COVID-19\n2021 Season abandoned due to COVID-19"

The pavilion at the ground is an exact replica of the one found at Ampleforth College in England, where Savill was educated. First-class cricket was first played at the ground in 2012, when Ireland played South Africa A. The ground was scheduled to host two Twenty20 matches as part of the tour, however both matches were cancelled due to rain. The future of the ground was called into question in 2013, when residents of a neighbouring property took legal action in the High Court after complaining about excess noise from the venue. The ground hosted a first-class match between Leinster Lightning and North West Warriors in 2017 Inter-Provincial Championship, which was the inaugural domestic first-class match to be played in Leinster."

        "text": "The 1884 Southern Rugby Union season was the 11th season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. This was the second competition for the Gardiner Cup which was awarded to the winners of the premiership. The football season lasted from May till September 1884 with the main cup games held between June and August. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Burwood. Burwood were crowned premiers by a committee of the Union.\nTeams.\nFive Senior Clubs competed for the Gardiner Challenge Cup. Senior Clubs competed against each other for the Cup and played other games against Junior or Country Clubs. Only the first teams from the Senior Clubs were eligible for the Cup.\nRule changes.\nThe Sydney Rugby Premiership was still in its infancy in 1884 with many aspects of the championship undeveloped. It was the second year that the Gardiner Challenge Cup was to be given to the winner of the Premiership. As per the previous year, a committee was setup to organise the competition for the Cup. Their task was to arrange the contests and determine the conditions that the Cup would be awarded. However, the matches were rather sporadic with games intermingled between those against Junior Clubs and Country Clubs. Supporters of the game questioned the arrangement of matches and suggested organising rounds with a concluding final. The first games between Senior teams for the Cup were held on 21 June despite many of the clubs having played games since early May against Junior teams. The premiership was again decided by the committee at the conclusion of the season.\nSeason summary.\nThe Wallaroo Football Club began their Cup matches with a string of victories. It wasn't until they met Sydney University in a return match that the Wallaroos lost their first game. Unfortunately, they then lost against both Redfern and Burwood in close matches. Against the 'Varsity, Wallaroo had won one game and had lost the second. This was the same against Burwood. Across the entire season, the Club played 15 games, winning 11 of them. Eight of these games were against Senior Clubs with Wallaroo victorious in 5 of them.\nThe Sydney University Football Club finished the Cup games strong, winning three out of the last four games. Over the season, the 'Varsity played 15 games and won 11. In the Cup matches, the Club played 8 games against the Senior Clubs, winning 5. The 'Varsity lost against Wallaroo and Burwood but were able to reverse the result against Wallaroo in a return match later in the season. A return match against the Burwood Club saw the game end in controversy when a try was awarded near the end of the game. The first umpire for the game declared no try as time had ended, while the second umpire indicated that time was still available. The matter was passed on to the Union who declared the game as unfinished and therefore no result.\nThe Burwood Football Club enjoyed a successful season. The team played 13 matches, winning 11 of them and losing only 1. Against the Senior Clubs, Burwood played 7 games and won 5. Their only loss all season was against Wallaroo, whom they beat later in the year. After defeating University in their first matchup, their second match ended in controversy and was eventually declared \"no result\". This decision by the Union gave the Club the Premiership and the Gardiner Challenge Cup. During their matches, Burwood only had 9 points scored against them, indicating their strength in defence.\nLower grades.\nThe Southern Rugby Football Union classified the participating clubs into two groups, Seniors and Juniors. Prior to 1883, all clubs were considered for the Premiership. With the introduction of the Gardiner Challenge Cup, only Senior clubs participated in the competition. The Junior clubs competed with each other, but no award was recognised for their achievements. Matches between Senior and Junior teams were common place, with results in those matches assisting in deciding the final Senior Premiership winner.\nRepresentative games.\nNew Zealand rugby tour.\nIn 1884 the first team from New Zealand toured New South Wales and played a number of matches across the colony. The team was supported by the Canterbury Rugby Football Union, a provincial union who administered rugby in New Zealand until a national body was formed. Despite a New South Wales team having visited New Zealand in 1882, no games were played against a team representing the colony. This meant that the three games held in Sydney were the first time that a New Zealand Rugby team competed in football. In all, the team played eight games during the tour and were victorious in all of them scoring 167 points and conceding 17.\nDespite being known in modern times as the \"All Blacks\", the New Zealanders at the time wore dark blue jerseys with New South Wales playing in olive-green jerseys. The team that the visitors placed into the field was heavier than the local team. Much of the three matches saw play restricted to the NSW line with a number of attempts made by the New Zealanders at scoring. In three games between New South Wales and the visiting team, the New Zealand team scored 48 points to 2. One of the main draw cards for the matches was the Maori player, John Taiaroa, who dazzled whenever he had the ball.\nWith the three matches being played at the end of May into mid June, the Gardiner Challenge Cup was not begun until late June. At the conclusion of the matches, some of the touring players remained in Sydney and took up positions in the local clubs.\nIntercolonial matches.\nTwo intercolonial games were played in July between New South Wales and Queensland at the Association Ground in Sydney. Both matches saw the local New South Wales team display superior play resulting in two easy wins over the Queenslanders. The first match saw the NSW team score 4 tries to defeat the tourists 17 points to 4. The next match was entirely dominated by the local team with NSW scoring 7 tries to win 26 point to nil. In support of these matches, the Gardiner Cup was put on hold in order to allow players to be available for representative duties and not jeopardise their club's performance in the Cup."

        "text": "Jeremy Edwards (born 23 December 1991) is an Australian field hockey player.\nEdwards was born in Hobart, Tasmania, and made his senior international debut in a 2013 test series against Korea, in Perth, Western Australia.\nIn 2017, Edwards was elevated into the senior national team from the development squad, and has been a regular team member since.\nIn March 2018, Edwards was selected in the Australian national squad for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. The team won the gold medal, defeating New Zealand 2–0 in the final.\nEdwards has also been involved in several comedy projects. In 2007 he was part of the sketch comedy group Klarence Komedy, who released a sketch comedy CD titled \"Komedy That Lasts\". In 2015 they released their second album \"The Reunion\".\nEdwards also had a promising Indoor Cricket career. His most well known moment was the infamous final over vs Marlo Bros in the 2020 Oakleigh Indoor semi-final. With Marlo Bros requiring 14 off 1 delivery, victory seemed all but assured, however the pressure seemingly got to Jeremy as he delivered a front foot no ball resulting in 7 runs. In typical Edwards fashion he was able to gather himself and responded with an absolute peach of a delivery to send Luke's Legends through to the grand final. What followed is arguably the greatest 'what if' in sporting history. The 2020 Covid pandemic saw the grand final cancelled, never to be rescheduled. Riding a 12 game win streak and with Edwards at the helm, a dynasty loomed for Luke's Legends, but was over before it even began."

        "title": "1896 NSW Rugby Union season",
        "text": "The 1896 New South Wales Rugby Football Union season was the 23rd season of the Sydney Rugby Premiership. Six clubs competed from May till August 1896. The season culminated in the premiership, which was won by Randwick. Randwick were crowned premiers by virtue of finishing the season on top of the table.\nTeams.\nSenior grade.\nSix clubs signed up with the New South Wales Rugby Football Union to play the Senior Premiership. Each of the teams had participated in the premiership previously. At the end of the previous season, both the Balmain Football Club and Paddington Electorate Football Club had withdrawn from the premiership. At the beginning of the new season, a Paddington Football Club was formed which could be considered a new club. However, the Union did not agree and would classify the club as a continuation of the previous one. This would have ramifications for Paddington later in the season.\nSeason summary.\nThe 1896 NSWRFU Sydney Rugby Premiers, Randwick, experienced a great year. Until their defeat at the hands of Wentworth in the semifinal for the Agricultural Society Trophy, Randwick were undefeated and had positioned themselves in an unassailable position on the premiership ladder. The club had already won the Association Ground Cup in a closely fought match with old rivals Wallaroo. In 19 games played throughout the entire season (including non-premiership matches), Randwick won 16, drew 1 and lost 2, scoring 249 points with 55 against. A remarkable record.\nMuch of the success of the Wentworth Football Club can be attributed to their captain Billy Warbrick. At the conclusion of the season the team were second to only Randwick in performance and had successfully won the Agricultural Society Trophy. As organiser, coach and captain, Warbrick's experience and knowledge was vital. Excluding the captain, nobody on the Wentworth team had big reputations or had previously been selected for representative positions. Many of the team were Juniors last season and so were pliable in their captains hands.\nDuring the season, a proposal was put forward at a NSWRFU meeting advocating local football rather than the club football in existence. The belief was that football was losing its popularity and that the quality of play was deteriorating. Advocates indicated how cricket had successfully transitioned to local-based competition. The proposal was put to a vote and lost. However, the idea of local football had now been given birth. In analysing the current season, some of the most reliable and energetic players amongst the Seniors in 1896 were playing in the Junior ranks last season. This was seen as proof that the Senior clubs should be searching amongst the Junior teams for their players. It was even stated that the Sydney Rugby community had enough capable players to sustain 10 good Senior teams.\nTrophy finals.\nFinals Week 1, 27 June.\nAssociation Ground Cup.\nThe top four teams that qualified for the Association Ground Cup were Randwick, Sydney University, Wentworth and Wallaroo. The games were decided by draw. In the first semi, Randwick defeated the 'Varsity, 21 points to nil. It was a convincing win for the premiers with most of their points being scored in the second half. The second semi final saw a much closer game between Wallaroo and Wentworth. Wallaroo had the upper hand throughout the game and proceeded to the final to face Randwick.\nFinals Week 2, 4 July.\nAssociation Ground Cup.\nA large crowd of 10,000 witnessed one of the most highly anticipated games. The game was a fierce and fast encounter with some players sent from the field. Wallaroo persistently attacked with Randwick holding strong in defence. After half time, the score was 3 points to nil in favour of Randwick. Soon after the second half had begun, Wallaroo took the lead 5 points to 3. However, Randwick soon rectified the result taking the lead once again. From this point to the end of the match, Wallaroo performed attack after attack with Randwick's defence holding firm. The final result gave Randwick their third win in the Cup. With this, Randwick became the permanent holders of the Association Ground Cup.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nOnly one game was played for the Agricultural Society Trophy. The University-Pirates game was a fine example of football with \"clean passing runs, able kicks, quick intercepting runs, long passes, fine fainting and capital tackling.\" The Pirates were strengthened by a number of new players who held themselves quite well against the more experienced 'Varsity. At half time, University led 5 points to nil. During the second half, the Pirates scored but missed the conversion which cost them the match. The second game scheduled for the weekend was to be between Wentworth and Paddington. However, the Paddington club, which had been reformed at the beginning of the season, had inherited the past debits of the former club. As these debits were with the NSWRFU, the Union disqualified the club from the competition and awarded Wentworth the win.\nFinals Week 3, 11 July.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nThe first semi final for the trophy was played between Randwick and Wentworth. After the previous match against Wallaroo, Randwick had some players who were not at their best due to the intensity of that game. Wentworth, on the other hand, had done everything possible to ensure it had its best players available and were well prepared for the game. As a result, Randwick failed to play the majority of the game with their usual \"dash\" and met strong defence from Wentworth. A single try was scored by the Wentworth Captain to win the match. The second semi final saw Wallaroo play Sydney University. A high scoring match saw points added rapidly. Wallaroo won the game 30 points to 10.\nFinals Week 4, 8 August.\nAgricultural Society Trophy.\nIn the lead up to the game, it was feared that Wentworth would not be able to put up their best team for the match. Some of the players had been selected to play in the NSW representative team and were unavailable. As a sign of good sportsmanship, the Wallaroo captain PM Lane offered Wentworth to pick any player of their choice to ensure the game could be played. The Wentworth captain, W Warbrick, picked AG Fraser from the Randwick club to play for the team. The game was an \"interesting and determined\" one with nothing of excitement to note. Wentworth won with ease with Wallaroo lacking in aggressive tendencies. The defeated team never looked likely to score.\nLower grades.\nThe NSWRFU held four junior premierships in conjunction to the main senior competition. All four grades were well represented with some clubs entering multiple teams across the four competitions.\nFirst Juniors.\nInitially, twelve clubs signed up for the First Junior Premiership. These were: Marrickville, Newtown, Paddington Borough, Strathfield, Summer Hill Oaklands, University II, Balmain A, Leichhardt, Petersham, Carlton, Central Cumberland and Woollahra. Both Petersham and Woollahra dropped out of the premiership before it had begun. When the regular season games had been completed, the following teams qualified for the semi-finals: Carlton, Paddington Boroughs, Leichhardt and Newtown. In the final Carlton played Newtown. Newtown created an upset, winning the match 6 points to 3 to be declared premiers.\nSecond Juniors.\nThe Second Junior Premiership saw 17 clubs sign up to compete. These were: Richmond, Hawkesbury College, Wallaroo II, Balmain Junior, Manly Federal, Buccaneer, Oriental, Royal Oak, Federal, Hawkesbury, Shamrock, Homebush, University III, Pioneer, Rockdale, Mercantile and North Sydney. At the conclusion of the regular rounds, eight teams qualified for the finals: Buccaneer, Royal Oak, Homebush, Mercantile, Hawkesbury, North Sydney, Balmain Junior and Rockdale. The final saw Buccaneer play Mercantile. Mercantile won the match 15 points to 5 to be declared premiers.\nThird Juniors.\nThe number of teams entered into the Third Junior Premiership was down compared to the previous season with 13 joining the competition. Clubs that signed up were: Ashfield, Glebe, Waverley, Pirates II, Willoughby Oaks, Ryde, Double Bay, Newtown Cambridge, Redfern Waratah, Balmain B, Adelphi, Hunter's Hill and Redfern Norwood. When the regular rounds were completed, the following teams qualified for the semi-finals: Glebe, Adelphi, Redfern Waratah and Pirates II. The final saw Glebe play Redfern Waratah. Redfern Waratah won the match 3 points to nil to be declared premiers.\nFourth Juniors.\nForty clubs signed up to compete in the Fourth Junior Premiership in 1896. Due to the large number of teams entered, four divisions were created with teams allocated to each. In Division A were: Granville Royal, Hawkesbury College II, Hawkesbury Excelsior, St Mary's Union, Ardler, Windsor, Rookwood, Liverpool, Iona and Parramatta Ormonde. Division B teams were: Richmond II, Fort Street College, Chelsea, Woollahra Junior, South Sydney Juniors, Adelphi II, Boy's Brigade, Willoughby Federal, Coogee and Mosman. In Division C were: Imperial, Balmain C, Forest Lodge Cambridge, Carolinas, Rosegrove, Toxteth, Endeavour, Balmain Waratah, Warren and Leichhardt Gladstone. Division D teams were: Redfern Cambridge, Enmore Oaks, Summer Hill Oaklands II, Royal, Petersham II, Epsom, Belvidere, Newtown II, Victoria and Erskineville. When the regular rounds were completed, the following teams qualified for the finals: Parramatta Ormonde, Granville Royal, South Sydney Juniors, Woollahra Junior, Forest Lodge Cambridge, Endeavour, Victoria and Newtown II. In the final Woollahra Junior play Newtown II. Woollahra Junior won the match in the dying moments 6 points to 5 to take the premiership."

The Tour began in Noirmoutier-en-l'Île with flat stage on 7 July, and Stage 12 occurred on 19 July with a mountainous stage from Bourg-Saint-Maurice. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 29 July.\nStage 12.\n19 July 2018 – Bourg-Saint-Maurice to Alpe d'Huez, \nThe riders departed southwest from Bourg-Saint-Maurice, with racing starting at Bellentre.

General classification contender Vincenzo Nibali, who was fourth overall, was forced to withdraw from the Tour following the stage after an incident near the summit of Alpe d'Huez where he fell off his bike. Although he remounted his bike and finished the stage, he was soon transported to hospital in an ambulance and diagnosed with a fractured vertebrae. It was initially suspected that the crash had been caused by a police motorcycle driving in front of him, but it later emerged that he crashed after being caught in a spectator's camera strap. Nibali's team management saw the lack of crowd control from the gendarmerie (French Armed Forces police) and spectators lighting flares as contributing factors. While race director Christian Prudhomme appealed to fans to show the riders more respect, and personally apologised to the team and promised that the safety would be improved in the future. The team management believed the ASO could be held responsible for the incident, and the incident later became a legal matter when Nibali filed a complaint to the French police.\nStage 13.\n20 July 2018 – Le Bourg-d'Oisans to Valence, \nThe stage departed heading north and then downhill west to Vizille.

        "text": "David Palfreyman (born 1945) is an Australian former coxswain, rower and rowing coach. He was a national champion three times as a coxswain and twice as a rower and won a gold medal at the 1962 Commonwealth Games.\nClub and state rowing.\nDavid Palfreyman's commenced his association with the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne as a coxswain at aged thirteen coaching veteran crews. He is the grandson of Cecil McVilly, a sculler who in 1912 was the first rower to represent Australia at an Olympic games.\nHe first made state selection for Victoria coxing the 1960 state lightweight four contesting the Penrith Cup at the Interstate Regatta. He coxed another Victorian crew which won the Penrith Cup in 1962. In 1961 and in 1963 he coxed Victorian men's eights to victory in the King's Cup at the Interstate Regattas in those years.\nIn 1964 Palfreyman took up an oar and was successful in being selected to stroke that year's Victorian lightweight four. That crew won the 1964 Penrith Cup title as the champion state representative lightweight four at the Interstate Regatta. In 1972 and in 1974 he stroked the Victoria men's eights which contested the King's Cup at the Interstate Regatta.\nIn 1966 he stroked a Mercantile four which won the coxless four Australian title at the Australian Rowing Championships.\nInternational representative rowing.\nThe entire winning Victorian King's Cup crew of 1962 was selected as the Australian eight to contest the 1962 Commonwealth Games. Their coxswain Norton was unable to make the trip and Palfreyman, who'd coxed the Victorian lightweight four to a Penrith Cup victory took the eight and steered it to a gold medal victory at the Commonwealth Games in Perth. That same crew was encouraged to represent Australia at the inaugural FISA World Championships, the 1962 World Championships in Lucerne. They financed their trip themselves, made it through to the final and finished in overall fifth place.\nThe 1966 Australian champion coxless four which he stroked was selected in toto that year to represent at the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled. They missed the semi-final by a 0.04 margin and were eliminated in the repechage.\nCoaching career.\nFollowing competitive rowing retirement Palfreyman had a thirty-year coaching career of school, club, state, national and Olympic crews. In some years he coached part-time at the Victorian Institute of Sport.\nFor seven consecutive years from 1980 to 1986 Palfreyman coached the Victorian state women's fours who contested and all won the ULVA Trophy at the Australian Interstate Regatta.In 1983 he also coached the Victorian men's eight who came second in that year's King's Cup.\nHe took Australian crews to six World Rowing Championships between 1978 and 1985 - lightweight eights in 1978 and 1984; a women's coxed four in 1979; and women's pairs in 1981, 1982 and 1985. In 1980 he was the coach of the Australian women's coxed four who rowed to a fifth place at the 1980 Moscow Olympics. In 2008 he coached the Australian Women's Double Scull at the Beijing Olympic Games.\nCoaching palmares.\nAustralian Interstate Regatta\nWorld Championships and Olympics"
